[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  So you, this is amazing, might as well open up with it, there's, I'm reading Twitter last night and
[00:05.840 --> 00:09.040]  all of a sudden I'm thumbing through my Twitter and there's a picture of you
[00:09.920 --> 00:17.280]  with Tim Cook at a Maple Leafs game. Yeah, I was as surprised as anybody. How the hell did that
[00:17.280 --> 00:23.680]  happen? So I didn't know, I was just like, I thought there was gonna be just, you know,
[00:23.680 --> 00:27.040]  some briefing and Apple does a lot of these and you do them too, like maybe they would announce
[00:27.040 --> 00:31.200]  there like something about Hour of Code or it's, they're going to do a French version or they're
[00:31.200 --> 00:37.120]  going to have Canadian specific content or something, I had no idea. And then I see the
[00:37.120 --> 00:42.560]  Globe and Mail says Tim Cook is in Canada for a code and he just dropped by, like he does this,
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.880]  they don't announce it, I'm guessing for security reasons, but you know, also because it's Apple
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.240]  and it's all about surprise and delight. He just crashed the code session at the Apple store
[00:52.240 --> 00:55.920]  and you know, people love that kind of stuff and he did a couple of interviews while he was there
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.080]  and I'm like, oh, if I had known, I would have gone. I mean, it's not that far, it would have
[01:00.080 --> 01:05.040]  been awesome. I'm like, oh, too bad. But then I was supposed to do this meeting later and then
[01:05.040 --> 01:11.280]  they were very quiet about it. And eventually I just got a call saying, you know, come here,
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.440]  do this, do that. And then, okay, Tim's here. And I just like, okay, wow. And he was watching the
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.640]  Leafs game. He was sitting down there with one of the Hockey Night in Canada announcers, former
[01:22.640 --> 01:28.240]  hockey player, just enjoying the show. And then he came up and said hi to some of the Apple people
[01:28.240 --> 01:32.800]  there. And then, you know, I was towards the back of the line and then eventually I got a chance to
[01:32.800 --> 01:42.480]  say hi to him as well. That's amazing. Who won the game? The Maple Leafs did not win the game.
[01:42.480 --> 01:46.640]  The team formerly known as the Quebec Nordique, which I think now use some weird name like the
[01:46.640 --> 01:53.920]  Colorado Avalanche one. Hmm. Americans take a lot of Canadian teams and make them super successful.
[01:53.920 --> 02:00.880]  So we're a little bit bitter. All right. So it's a good thing. It's funny because I originally was
[02:00.880 --> 02:08.960]  going to try to record this with you yesterday, which was Monday, the 22nd of January. And
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.320]  instead we had to push it back till today, the 23rd. And in the meantime, you went to a hockey
[02:14.320 --> 02:23.120]  game with Tim Cook and Apple. Can I say finally, I believe, I believe I'm the arbiter of finallys
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.720]  of appropriate finallys. And I'm going to, I'm going to give this a, I'm going to give this a
[02:28.720 --> 02:37.520]  finally plus a pending. Finally, they've finally announced that HomePod is when it's coming out
[02:37.520 --> 02:45.040]  on what the schedule is. Orders start this coming Friday, probably a few days after this episode
[02:45.040 --> 02:52.080]  lands. And it will start shipping two weeks after that on February the 9th. And I guess it will be
[02:52.080 --> 03:00.240]  in retail stores at the same time too. Presumably, presumably there, there will be reviews in between
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.600]  as we record and February 9th. But, but I don't know anything about that yet.
[03:05.600 --> 03:11.520]  No. And we can't even draw upon AirPods because those, I mean, they had originally planned to
[03:12.160 --> 03:15.200]  get those out earlier and they seeded them and then they didn't get it out.
[03:15.200 --> 03:21.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was weird. Cause we got, it is funny and we'll come back to that because
[03:21.520 --> 03:29.360]  the more we learn about HomePod, the more it really does kind of seem like AirPods as speakers.
[03:30.320 --> 03:33.280]  Yes. That's exactly the way I would describe it.
[03:33.280 --> 03:42.400]  And it's similar even down to the fact of being late. But one difference is that when AirPods
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.400]  were on the cusp of shipping a year ago did you get up the pre-release pair?
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.280]  Yeah. I don't think that. Yeah. I think they were seeded pretty liberally.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.840]  We got pre-release AirPods that in my experience using them was indistinguishable
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.040]  from the final ones. Although I think maybe, although I don't know if it was a hardware thing
[04:05.040 --> 04:12.240]  or, or subsequent software things, as much as I loved them right from the first day with the
[04:12.240 --> 04:19.040]  prototypes, I have to say that now a year later, I think they're even more reliable than before.
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.400]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:22.080 --> 04:26.560]  But they were very serious about those being prototypes. And when they shipped the shipping
[04:26.560 --> 04:31.680]  ones, they, they, they wanted those prototypes back in the mail the next day. It was the only
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.920]  review product I've ever gotten from Apple where there was any hint of pressure of send it back
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.760]  right now. It's like, I wondered if there was like, maybe it didn't use lithium ion, maybe it
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.680]  used kryptonite as the battery just to make it work. I don't know. The demeanor was always Apple
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.480]  friendly. You know, it was always, you know, it wasn't like they sent the Brute Squad, you know,
[04:52.480 --> 05:00.080]  big angry people to come collect them. But it was, it was, you know, get them in the mail.
[05:01.120 --> 05:03.280]  Yep. I have no idea. Yeah.
[05:05.280 --> 05:08.320]  I think just in general, Apple is one of those companies that they don't want pre-release stuff
[05:08.320 --> 05:10.560]  out there, because you never know what's going to happen to it.
[05:10.560 --> 05:13.760]  So who knows what the difference is? I think that because these are a little bit
[05:13.760 --> 05:20.480]  less of a, just, you know, there is some similarities to AirPods, but I don't think,
[05:20.480 --> 05:25.360]  I'm not surprised that they didn't seed prototype HomePods outside the company.
[05:26.320 --> 05:31.040]  Yeah. Although they did a huge seeding of prototype HomePods inside the company.
[05:31.040 --> 05:36.880]  I have heard the same thing, that it was pretty widespread internal seeding amongst employees.
[05:38.080 --> 05:41.120]  And, you know, I guess we in geographies beyond what they've already announced.
[05:41.120 --> 05:51.680]  Yeah. And I think that, doesn't that go all the way back to the big, on the eve of the iPhone 10
[05:51.680 --> 06:00.880]  and iPhone 8 announcement, it was a HomePod firmware update that leaked a bunch of details,
[06:00.880 --> 06:07.120]  like the name iPhone with a capital X that we didn't know how to pronounce. It was a HomePod
[06:07.120 --> 06:12.960]  release. And I guess the reason that that was even possibly on and over the, you know, public
[06:12.960 --> 06:18.800]  to the world server was that they were already at the time, seeded widely within the company
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.480]  to people to use at home. Absolutely.
[06:21.120 --> 06:28.480]  All right. So the, that's the dates, the price is the same. I don't think we learned much more
[06:28.480 --> 06:38.000]  about the functionality from the updated product page. But my pending finally is that in some
[06:38.880 --> 06:45.760]  very small print, not one of the headlines that the iPod or the HomePod announcement also included
[06:45.760 --> 06:54.160]  the news that AirPlay 2 will be coming later this year. And what that means for HomePod early
[06:54.160 --> 07:03.520]  adopters is that at least three of the promised features will have to wait until AirPlay 2 ships.
[07:03.520 --> 07:12.480]  Those are first, the ability to buy two HomePods, put them in the same room and have them coordinate
[07:12.480 --> 07:22.720]  with each other to work in stereo. Which I believe they, they demoed that for us back at WWDC,
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.640]  right? I'm not misremembering that. I seem to recall.
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.600]  Absolutely. They had two of them. So I'm confused about the stereo part of this. So, and maybe it's
[07:29.600 --> 07:34.400]  because I'm completely ignorant about audio, but the way that it works is it uses computational
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.440]  audio to sort of model the room and then project sound into different parts of it. So the way that
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.720]  you traditionally think about stereo is if you want sound on the left, you have to have a speaker
[07:42.720 --> 07:46.000]  on the left. If you want sound on the right, you have to have a speaker on the right, where this
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.960]  projects and bounces sound to all different parts of it. So the stereo thing doesn't, doesn't seem
[07:50.960 --> 07:55.840]  to fit for me. And I know Apple is using the word and I just wonder, like originally my understanding
[07:55.840 --> 08:00.880]  was you'd put more HomePods to fill bigger areas that, you know, because it's a speaker, it's still
[08:00.880 --> 08:04.960]  that limited range. And if you wanted a bigger room, you'd put two. If you wanted an even bigger
[08:04.960 --> 08:09.040]  room, you'd put three. But when we talk about stereo, I just, I wonder maybe it's cleaner
[08:09.040 --> 08:13.920]  because you don't have to do the bouncing or the sort of trickery or the magic to get the sound
[08:13.920 --> 08:19.280]  different parts and you can more clearly isolate them. So maybe it's a better stereo or, or surround
[08:19.280 --> 08:27.840]  experience with multiple HomePods. Yeah, I that's actually interesting. And linguistically, I'd
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.480]  never thought I had the exact same thought, René, and I'm wondering if it'll be possible if they say
[08:32.480 --> 08:37.120]  two, but if if like you're saying like, once AirPlay two comes out, could you get three or four
[08:37.840 --> 08:43.280]  to fill like a sufficiently big room? I asked and they they just said, like, if you really want to,
[08:43.280 --> 08:46.640]  it should and I don't know if this has changed or if I'm remembering it wrong. But my understanding
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.000]  was, you could put several of them in and it would just figure it out. But that most people
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.200]  would never need to put that many in one room. Right. And and I do think it's, you know, again,
[08:56.320 --> 09:03.840]  it's often best to take Apple in its most obvious way. The name is HomePod. So it's not, you know,
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.640]  these things aren't meant for like a commercial, you know, a big commercial space that would be
[09:08.640 --> 09:15.600]  bigger than what someone would typically consider a stadium pod. Right. But it is interesting. I've
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.560]  always thought of stereo, the word stereo, like you just said, like, just left and right,
[09:20.560 --> 09:27.440]  literally left, not just two, but left and right. And but now that I think about it as like a word
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.800]  nerd, it's not the root isn't like duo or something, you know, it's not duo phonic.
[09:34.800 --> 09:40.880]  And so I'm looking up stereo here in the dictionary word. The first one is sound that is
[09:40.880 --> 09:45.280]  directed through two or more speakers so that it seems to surround the listener and come from more
[09:45.280 --> 09:53.120]  than one source stereophonic sound. But if you scroll down to just the just the prefix stereo
[09:53.120 --> 09:59.280]  as a combining form, this makes more sense relating to solid forms having three dimensions
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.160]  stereography. So I you know, I think in theory, you could have more than two and it would just
[10:04.160 --> 10:07.360]  figure it out. And I think even when you do have only two, I think it'll be a lot more,
[10:08.240 --> 10:15.040]  a lot less about left and right and a lot more about how best to make it sound like
[10:15.040 --> 10:19.360]  the music is coming from as many sources as possible, you know, instruments are making
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.880]  that 3d model. Right the room. Yeah, right. I think it sounds Yeah, I think thinking of it as 3d
[10:24.880 --> 10:30.640]  as is makes more sense as to how the two will coordinate then left, right. Yeah. Right. And
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.800]  it's almost like left, right, literally is just two dimensional, you know, whereas it's really
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.000]  more about three dimensional. And I seem to recall that from the demo. I mean, what I recall, I mean,
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.480]  and you know, this is, geez, what was that? Like, eight months ago? Yeah, June 2017. I remember
[10:46.480 --> 10:53.120]  that it sounded good. And almost most of the demo was here's a song, we'll play it on the on one,
[10:53.120 --> 10:58.240]  you know, the single home pod, then we'll play it on the, what was it a Sonos thing? Yeah,
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.640]  and then we'll play it on the little set of Amazon tin cans. Well, the Amazon thing really came off
[11:04.640 --> 11:09.360]  looking bad in that demo. I mean, it really I was in with like, as much as like, I don't know music,
[11:09.360 --> 11:13.120]  but I was in with Dalrymple, which was hugely informative for me, because he, you know, he is,
[11:14.080 --> 11:18.560]  I don't know what the right, but he is like, zealot, almost angry about the quality of his
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.720]  music. And we were, and they showed us like, they played normal songs, and they played some live
[11:22.720 --> 11:28.960]  recordings. And as little as I know, or appreciate sound, I have Sonos at home, I've had it for years,
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.680]  I'm all in on Sonos. It was way better than Sonos for almost all the songs, I think one of it,
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.760]  it sounded about as good as Sonos. But the live stuff and some of the other stuff, it sounded just
[11:37.760 --> 11:43.440]  as good. And it totally, rightfully so, because the Amazon really was a speaker second and
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.760]  a voice isn't first, but it totally embarrassed the Echo. Yeah, I think I'm an interesting
[11:47.760 --> 11:53.920]  contrast to Jim, because I'm, not that I don't care about audio, but I really just, I just don't
[11:53.920 --> 11:59.280]  think I have good ears for it, you know, and I'm not musical at all. I like music, you know,
[11:59.280 --> 12:06.640]  certain, you know, certain types of music. But it's a much more, as opposed to like,
[12:06.640 --> 12:12.640]  my opinions on, let's say, a TV, you know, the way a TV set looks. I have very strong opinions
[12:12.640 --> 12:20.320]  about everybody. But as a casual music fan, I would have to look back at my notes. But as I
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.960]  recall, that was my take exactly, there was one song where I didn't feel like I could Pepsi
[12:24.960 --> 12:30.640]  Challenge the and prefer the HomePod over Sonos, I would call it, I would have called it a draw.
[12:30.640 --> 12:38.880]  But every other one, I felt confident that even as a, as you would say, a punter, that I would,
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.520]  I would, I thought the HomePod sounded better. And anyway, at the end of the demo, then it was like,
[12:43.520 --> 12:47.440]  here's the one more thing of the little demo. I think it was always with it was like a groups
[12:47.440 --> 12:54.080]  like four and five at a time in a sort of living room size space. And I was gonna say Moscone,
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.280]  but of course, it's not called Moscone. What's that place called? Yeah, San Jose.
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.080]  The San Jose mouthful convention center. Yes.
[13:04.560 --> 13:08.240]  There was, you know, typically, it's just the Apple formula. It's like, here's the one more
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.120]  thing. If you have a second one, you can do this. And it was like, here's what the song sounds like
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.520]  with one HomePod. And it sounded pretty good. And I remember when the second one kicked in,
[13:17.520 --> 13:24.400]  it did sound better. And it did sound fuller, fuller. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's what I
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.000]  remember the noticing the difference with the Sonos. And again, I've used Sonos for years,
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.920]  I have a ton of their stuff is it just sounded richer and deeper and more like,
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.800]  like more of an emotional experience. Yeah. And then when the second one came on, it was just
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.720]  written, just even better. It was just fuller. Yeah. It's like, I know, it's like you somehow
[13:42.720 --> 13:49.280]  I know, when I come into, you know, somebody's house, and they're playing music or movies or
[13:49.280 --> 13:54.480]  something, and or you're in a bar or something, and you hear it, you could, there's a certain
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.680]  part of me that can detect, hey, this is a serious sound system. I can't explain why. Like, I can't
[13:59.680 --> 14:04.400]  tell you what it is. I can just tell that somebody put some money into this thing. And yeah.
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.520]  That's absolutely what it sounded like with the two HomePods.
[14:10.640 --> 14:14.240]  Yeah, totally. It's like when you go in and you hear someone listening to a soundbar,
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.000]  as opposed to hear them listening to a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.280]  that's been properly set up. Still though, lots and lots of unanswered questions about HomePod.
[14:27.280 --> 14:35.600]  Yeah. In my opinion, you know, which I hope we'll get before it ships, but which I don't think we're
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.280]  going to get before pre-orders open, which leads to the interesting dilemma, probably
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.640]  for an awful lot of people who are listening to us on this show,
[14:44.640 --> 14:54.880]  of do you wait until you find out more before you spend $350 on this thing? Or do you buy in advance
[14:54.880 --> 15:05.280]  hoping that the answers will either be good or do you take your chances that maybe if you wait
[15:05.280 --> 15:11.200]  until you do get the answers, that it won't be back ordered for four months or something like
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.440]  that? Because that's the dance you have to play. I was just joking about that on Twitter. It seems
[15:15.440 --> 15:18.880]  like every time Apple announces something, Twitter starts saying how stupid Apple is and how stupid
[15:18.880 --> 15:22.480]  the product is. And then when they ship it, Twitter starts talking about how stupid it is
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.120]  that they can't order it immediately. That's like the seventh stage of the Twitter.
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.080]  You never know. And Apple, you know, talking about things like, hey, this is going to be
[15:32.800 --> 15:39.280]  in short supply isn't really what people who know talk about even off the record. But my gut feeling
[15:39.280 --> 15:47.280]  is that it may not be back ordered, like it was certainly not like AirPods were for most of the
[15:47.280 --> 15:48.240]  year last year.
[15:48.240 --> 15:52.480]  Well, it's so restricted, like AirPods were an international product. This is only launching
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.960]  in the US, Australia and the UK right now. And then sometime this spring in France and Germany.
[15:56.960 --> 15:59.040]  So it's a much smaller market for them to service.
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.320]  Well, and the other thing that I have heard, and I suspect you've probably heard similar
[16:04.320 --> 16:11.200]  is that the hardware was way ahead of the software on this. And that I think if it weren't
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.640]  for software, this would have shipped as promised in calendar year 2017.
[16:17.600 --> 16:22.640]  Totally. And people immediately blame Siri. But SiriKit shipped for the Apple TV last,
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.440]  sorry, for the HomePod last fall. AirPlay 2 is still not fully out.
[16:27.440 --> 16:34.960]  Yeah. And so certainly the development of AirPlay 2 is one factor because they were originally
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.880]  planning to, features that were advertised as this is going to be in this thing by the
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.600]  end of the year, were based on AirPlay 2. So given that AirPlay 2 still isn't out,
[16:45.600 --> 16:51.360]  the delay, whatever's the delay of AirPlay 2 is certainly one reason. I suspect that
[16:51.360 --> 16:55.680]  there are others. I don't know. Just some things. I don't know anything else specific.
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.720]  But I heard multiple times, though, that it's the software, not the hardware.
[17:00.720 --> 17:05.600]  Yeah. And I've heard multiple times, too, that it's not. I mean, there is a legitimate
[17:05.600 --> 17:08.880]  complaint to be made that Siri, I mean, we could back up a little bit. Apple's been working
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.360]  on this for years. And when I look at an Apple product, I try to figure out what problem
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.080]  is Apple trying to solve with this. And it looked, at least I think to Apple, it looked
[17:18.080 --> 17:22.720]  like we don't have a solution for you have all this Apple Music stuff you have, and you
[17:22.720 --> 17:26.320]  just can't drop something in. And it's sort of what the iPod Hi-Fi was trying to solve
[17:26.320 --> 17:31.360]  as well. And we want to give people a way to just buy something that's Apple-designed
[17:31.360 --> 17:36.160]  and that is incredibly simple to just drop into your room and it sounds really, really
[17:36.160 --> 17:40.000]  great. And it's easy to set up, as easy as AirPods. AirPods shipped earlier. As easy
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.800]  as AirPods to ship up. We have that technology. And we've done computational photography.
[17:44.800 --> 17:50.320]  We can do computational audio. And in that light, sort of the Siri stuff is secondary.
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.800]  Like AirPods are controlled through Siri and they can access the vast catalog of Siri things,
[17:54.800 --> 17:59.760]  but that's a convenience. It's the best way to interface with that product. And HomePod
[17:59.760 --> 18:03.520]  is the same. It's interesting. Like it can do Siri stuff. It's controlled with Siri.
[18:03.520 --> 18:08.000]  And you might as well use it to control HomeKit and to do those things. But it really, it
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.480]  really was an audio solution. It really was a speaker that Apple spent a lot of time and
[18:12.480 --> 18:17.680]  put an incredible amount of technology into making. A lot of people have been asking me
[18:17.680 --> 18:27.120]  today, what do I think the reason is for the software delay? And I don't know. I don't
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.400]  have any inside information on anything specifically other than obviously AirPlay 2 is taking a
[18:32.400 --> 18:38.320]  long. But why is AirPlay 2 taking longer? That's the nature of software. I mean software
[18:38.320 --> 18:45.760]  projects often take longer, sometimes a lot longer than you thought they would even when
[18:45.760 --> 18:50.880]  what you thought they would, you multiplied by 2x because you think, well, here's how
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.480]  long I think it'll take. I'll multiply it by two because it always takes me twice as
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.080]  long as I think. And you still come up short. It's just the nature of the game.
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.840]  I think the best way to describe it without like, well, I think the best way to describe
[19:01.840 --> 19:07.760]  it is let's say you wanted to ship the iPad, the iMac Pro, and you put that T2 chip in.
[19:07.760 --> 19:14.480]  And in the process of setting up T2, you realize that there was a web of authentication stuff
[19:14.480 --> 19:19.280]  of authentication stuff that had been built up over the years, but had some architectural
[19:19.280 --> 19:24.320]  issues that you'd never taken the time to go back and fix, but were now problematic
[19:24.320 --> 19:29.280]  to get that product to ship. Now that did not happen with the iMac Pro. We did get the
[19:29.280 --> 19:34.480]  ridiculous root blank stuff that surfaced, but nothing to stop the product. And I think
[19:34.480 --> 19:41.040]  this is similar. In making AirPlay 2, they hit some things that were just long existing
[19:41.040 --> 19:44.560]  issues in the code that they never needed to address before. And in order to make this
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.160]  work, they had to go back and address them. And they've addressed it to the point where
[19:48.160 --> 19:51.920]  it functions now, but it's not at the point yet where all of those features are available.
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.080]  Yeah. And either going back to fix things that you didn't think would be so hard to
[19:56.080 --> 20:01.840]  fix or solving new problems that you didn't, and you know, that some step along the way
[20:01.840 --> 20:06.880]  was a lot harder than you thought it was going to be, or some step along the way of solving
[20:06.880 --> 20:12.640]  this new problem, you go down a dead end and have to go back because it actually doesn't
[20:12.640 --> 20:21.760]  work. I mean, software is a lot like writing. And to me, it's always often very similar
[20:21.760 --> 20:31.680]  to the idea that it's like being a lawmaker. When lawmakers write laws, they hopefully
[20:31.680 --> 20:37.920]  should take their time and write them in a way that it's very clear what is and is
[20:37.920 --> 20:45.440]  not against the law. But if you think like you've got, you know, we've got here's
[20:45.440 --> 20:54.880]  an MPEG3 audio file, and we want it to go through this speaker over the air in a certain
[20:54.880 --> 21:00.800]  way over a certain protocol, and have certain things happen to analyze the music, and then
[21:00.800 --> 21:10.320]  come out of these tweeters in this base in this way, you know, yeah. That's not fully
[21:10.320 --> 21:16.000]  thought out. That's just an outline. And as you fill that in, to actually make it completely
[21:16.000 --> 21:20.800]  thought out, that's the actual programming, right? It's never actually fully thought
[21:20.800 --> 21:26.160]  out until the programming is complete. And so you never know when you're going from
[21:26.160 --> 21:31.120]  the plan for the software to the actual software where you're going to hit a point that is
[21:31.760 --> 21:35.120]  way tougher, trickier, takes longer than you thought it would.
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.120]  Yeah, and the requirements, like we've all experienced issues with airplay and with core
[21:41.120 --> 21:45.600]  audio that are mildly annoying when you're just trying to, you know, project your video
[21:45.600 --> 21:50.400]  or record something, but that would be absolute deal breakers if the product had to be rock
[21:50.400 --> 21:54.400]  solid, reliable streaming audio all the time. And that just can't ship that way. Like you've
[21:54.400 --> 21:58.800]  got to go back and fix all that stuff. Yeah, I mean, I'm not making excuses for them. It
[21:58.800 --> 22:03.680]  does look bad. You know, that's something that they were promised that they promised
[22:03.680 --> 22:12.160]  to ship by the end of 2017 in June. Now in January is later 2018. I mean, it could be
[22:12.160 --> 22:20.640]  pushing up for all we know, it could be pushing up against WWDC again. Yeah, I would guess
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.560]  that it's better than shipping it because if they shipped and it didn't work, that would
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.880]  be even worse. Right? That's what I don't get. Like, I'm not saying Apple, it comes
[22:28.880 --> 22:32.160]  out, you know, I'm not making excuses for them. I'm just explaining what I tried to
[22:32.160 --> 22:39.360]  explain what the situation is. And, you know, you could say that, you know, you can be mad
[22:39.360 --> 22:43.520]  at them if you want. And you can say that this is a worrisome sign that, you know, maybe
[22:43.520 --> 22:48.400]  the company is slipping. It's not like it used to be, even though I can name a long
[22:48.400 --> 22:52.800]  list of products that shipped late. I was just telling, I was pointing out earlier this
[22:52.800 --> 22:58.160]  week on an article I wrote that, you know, like from the, this wouldn't have happened
[22:58.160 --> 23:03.200]  under Steve Jobs crowd. Steve Jobs was there when the white iPhone 4 shipped 10 months
[23:03.200 --> 23:10.000]  late. It was almost a full year after the black version shipped, which I remember distinctly
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.560]  because my wife was like, you know what, I'm going to get the white one. And no, I had
[23:14.560 --> 23:18.880]  the same experience. There is, we should make like a name for this law, but whenever someone
[23:18.880 --> 23:24.240]  says Steve Jobs would never, almost certainly he did at some point or was involved in the
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.760]  decision-making process that led to the product you think Steve would never have let Apple
[23:27.760 --> 23:31.840]  make. Yeah, it's a lot like there's always a Trump tweet for whatever, you know, like
[23:31.840 --> 23:35.600]  with this government shutdown that we had here in the US last weekend, there were all
[23:35.600 --> 23:42.080]  these, the last time that the US federal government shut down, Trump was on TV and on Twitter
[23:42.080 --> 23:48.080]  reiterating one message, which is that no matter what the government shutdown is always
[23:48.080 --> 23:55.520]  the fault of the president. Yeah, no, I mean, like it's absolutely true. And it's, I would
[23:55.520 --> 23:58.640]  just rather people stop making that argument because you never look good in hindsight.
[23:58.640 --> 24:03.840]  Right. But anyway, it's, you know, it is what it is. But the interesting dilemma, as you
[24:03.840 --> 24:09.440]  alluded to is you wish that there were no delay. You wish everything was all ready and,
[24:09.440 --> 24:14.080]  you know, the thing had shipped before Christmas and airplay too is bug free and solves all
[24:14.080 --> 24:18.560]  the airplay problems. But that didn't happen. It would have been better for Apple because
[24:18.560 --> 24:22.560]  the con, the competitive market is much different now than it was when Apple first announced
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.080]  it. There were, there were no products as far as I can remember that we're doing multi-personal
[24:28.080 --> 24:31.760]  assistance, like they would, they would do voice ID and try to figure out different people.
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.360]  There was no Google home max. There was no product that really had a good speaker attached
[24:35.360 --> 24:39.760]  to a good assistant. And in the months since the product has been delayed, many like Google
[24:39.760 --> 24:43.440]  put that service online. Amazon put that service online. They're both producing better speakers
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.920]  now. So Apple's entering a market much later with a much earlier product than they would
[24:47.920 --> 24:54.720]  have liked. Yeah. But so given where they are as of, you know, late December, 2017 with
[24:54.720 --> 25:00.240]  hardware that is apparently ready to go and software that was, could be made ready to
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.800]  go modulo airplay two, therefore missing some features in the meantime, what do you do if
[25:06.800 --> 25:12.080]  it's your decision to make the call? Do you wait, make the whole product wait until airplay
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.200]  two's ready or do you ship what you have and whip, you know, crack the whips on the airplay
[25:17.200 --> 25:22.400]  two team to get it out as soon as you can? I think that team has slept since before Christmas.
[25:22.400 --> 25:25.200]  I think I would have, I would have made, if it was up to me, I would have made the same
[25:25.200 --> 25:28.880]  decision Apple has made and ship it now. I mean, we'll see once I get the product. I
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.040]  mean, you know, maybe the thing's a disaster, but you know, assuming that it's everything
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.920]  that they are saying it will do right out of the box on day one works. I think it's
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.240]  worth shipping. I think, you know, I think there's a benefit to shipping both hardware
[25:42.240 --> 25:49.920]  and software for an indie one person creative shop or the world's most profitable corporation
[25:49.920 --> 25:56.160]  shipping is, you know, it's good and waiting for perfection, you know, can lead you to
[25:56.160 --> 26:02.000]  very long delays. You can't ship a product that doesn't perform its basic function,
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.440]  which I think was why Apple delayed it to begin with. Like it's got to be rock solid
[26:05.440 --> 26:09.600]  in terms of being a speaker. Once that happens, if it's missing a few of the more advanced
[26:09.600 --> 26:14.160]  features, it's not ideal, but you can shift it and get it in people's hands. And see,
[26:14.160 --> 26:17.840]  and that's one of the things with Apple and you know, Johnny Iva said this, that they
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.560]  don't really believe they understand their own products until they get them to the hands
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.720]  of the customers, because often the reaction to them informs where Apple takes them. And
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.240]  this gets that into people's hands. They're, they're late to market, but they're not
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.560]  as late as they would be if they kept it off market until AirPlay 2 is finished. So I think
[26:32.560 --> 26:36.800]  it's, it's the best situation they can do right now. Boy, is that isn't the best example
[26:36.800 --> 26:43.040]  of that ever the Apple watch where yeah, it's so there's so much more clarity in Apple's
[26:43.040 --> 26:51.520]  direction of it starting a year after it came out. You know, focusing it on notifications
[26:51.520 --> 26:56.880]  and fitness. Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, reliability. I mean, some of the stuff like
[26:56.880 --> 27:00.480]  the fact that the first one was so slow. Well, duh, everybody. I mean, Apple knew that. I
[27:00.480 --> 27:07.360]  mean, honestly, it's probably the only product I've ever seen in history where I, you know,
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.200]  during the product briefings, I was, I was, they apologized for how slow it was. Yeah.
[27:13.200 --> 27:17.840]  And I was operating at the thermal limits of that casing at the time, right? We're sorry,
[27:17.840 --> 27:24.320]  that's so slow. But that's really true for Apple watch. All right, let's take a break.
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.760]  But when we come back, I want to talk about HomePod versus in the competitive landscape,
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.280]  which you just alluded to about what and especially the post June competitive landscape,
[27:35.280 --> 27:44.160]  which really is different. But first, do you know what's a fun thing to do on the internet?
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.000]  I'll tell you what's a fun thing to do on the internet is buy a mattress. Casper is a company
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.680]  who makes products that are cleverly designed to mimic human curves, providing supportive comfort
[27:57.680 --> 28:04.080]  for all kinds of bodies. And they make it so easy to buy a mattress, or any of their other
[28:04.080 --> 28:11.120]  sleeping products. Look, you spend one third of your life sleeping, so you should be comfortable.
[28:11.120 --> 28:17.760]  It really is getting a nice bed and a comfortable mattress is money so well spent really is.
[28:20.240 --> 28:24.880]  The experts at Casper, they work tirelessly to make a quality sleep surface that cradles your
[28:24.880 --> 28:31.280]  natural geometry in all the right places. The original Casper mattress combines multiple
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.400]  supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface with just the right amount of sink
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.520]  and bounce as a breathable design, keeps you cool, regulates your body temperature through the night.
[28:42.080 --> 28:48.880]  And they have over 20,000 reviews and an average of 4.8 stars across Casper, Amazon, and Google.
[28:49.440 --> 28:52.880]  Now, maybe you say, well, maybe on their own site, you can't really take that.
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.800]  You can't fake those Amazon reviews, really. It really is a popular product. I know a lot
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.960]  of people who've bought them. They advertise on a bunch of podcasts. Like I said up front,
[29:04.960 --> 29:08.400]  it's a gimmick now. It's almost like a joke buying mattresses on the internet,
[29:08.400 --> 29:14.000]  but it's a real deal. It really is. They now offer two other types of mattresses,
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  the Wave and the Essential. The Wave features a patent-pended premium support system to mirror
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.440]  the natural shape of your body. The Essential has a streamlined design at a price that won't
[29:23.440 --> 29:30.960]  keep you up at night. And they also offer a wider array of other products like pillows and sheets,
[29:30.960 --> 29:37.040]  anything you need for your, as they call it, your sleep experience. Super convenient, affordable
[29:37.040 --> 29:42.080]  prices because Casper cuts out the middleman. They have hassle-free returns if you're not
[29:42.080 --> 29:46.240]  completely satisfied. I've gotten a couple of emails. They've been sponsoring the show for so
[29:46.240 --> 29:50.160]  long. I've gotten a couple of emails from people who said, you know what? I listened to your show.
[29:50.160 --> 29:56.320]  I bought a Casper. I actually didn't like it. And the one that I got like two or three of these
[29:56.320 --> 29:59.920]  over the years from people who said, you know, the most amazing thing is the one thing I just
[29:59.920 --> 30:03.440]  didn't believe is that it really would be easy to send it back. And it really was.
[30:03.440 --> 30:07.520]  And they thought that was great. They were like, so that's a mattress. I wound up not keeping it,
[30:07.520 --> 30:14.720]  but I super impressed with the company because they made it easy to return. And inside the US,
[30:14.720 --> 30:21.840]  they have free shipping and free returns. You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100-night
[30:21.840 --> 30:28.000]  risk-free sleep on it trial. We've got some Casper mattresses here in the house. We love them.
[30:28.000 --> 30:34.080]  They're, they're, they're really great. You get 50 bucks towards your select mattress by visiting
[30:34.080 --> 30:39.760]  casper.com slash the talk show and using the code, the talk show at checkout terms and conditions
[30:39.760 --> 30:47.440]  reply. So that's 50 bucks off the mattress of your choice. Casper.com slash the talk show and
[30:47.440 --> 30:53.120]  that code, the talk show my thanks to Casper for their continuing support of the talk show.
[30:53.120 --> 30:57.200]  A lot of people out there sleeping on internet mattresses, Renee.
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.480]  I I've been using Casper for years. I absolutely adore it.
[31:02.000 --> 31:08.240]  Competitive landscape. So two things I can think of two things in this regard. One,
[31:08.240 --> 31:14.240]  and you alluded to this, the audio quality of some of the competing products has gotten better since,
[31:14.240 --> 31:26.240]  since June at two. And I think this is the more important one is that the competing products,
[31:26.240 --> 31:30.880]  which I think it's safe to say are primarily from Google and Amazon, right? It's Google and
[31:30.880 --> 31:35.280]  Amazon. Microsoft has Cortana speakers, but they're not a thing really. I never hear anybody
[31:35.280 --> 31:42.720]  talking about it. The other ones, the Google and Amazon ones are sort of assistant first
[31:42.720 --> 31:48.640]  audio quality second. And I always say, this is like maybe one of the top three themes of
[31:48.640 --> 31:56.160]  my entire body of work is that the order of your priorities matters tremendously. Like it's not
[31:56.160 --> 32:03.760]  enough to say that you want something, you know, we want it to be a well-designed and
[32:06.320 --> 32:10.960]  high quality. Well, if you want it to be high quality and well-designed, you might end up
[32:10.960 --> 32:14.640]  with a different product just by, just by taking those two things and putting them in a different
[32:14.640 --> 32:20.160]  order, right? Like you might, you know, if the highest quality like durability is more important
[32:20.960 --> 32:24.640]  than the elegance of the design, you might end up with something that's a little thicker,
[32:24.640 --> 32:30.160]  uses different materials, et cetera. Even though those are two priorities that might go hand in
[32:30.160 --> 32:37.040]  hand in many ways, a subtle difference in order makes a difference. Absolutely. And for some
[32:37.040 --> 32:41.120]  people, the people that Apple chooses not to compete in usually it's the people for whom
[32:41.120 --> 32:46.000]  cheap or the low price or the, you know, is the most important feature. Right. And that
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.200]  certainly is going to be true in this regard because one of the most, right off the top,
[32:51.200 --> 32:56.560]  you can't miss it, differences is that these other devices are sort of in the hovering around
[32:56.560 --> 33:03.920]  the $150 range. And, you know, Amazon has the little pucks that I mean, they give them away
[33:03.920 --> 33:07.280]  with some things, I think they're going to start paying you soon to take. Right. I wouldn't be
[33:07.280 --> 33:12.400]  surprised. Yeah. You know, you said this so well with the AirPods, it's like, cause people
[33:12.400 --> 33:16.560]  complained about the price there too, because they were comparing them to traditional headphones
[33:16.560 --> 33:20.720]  or traditional Bluetooth headphones or headphones that they thought sounded better, but it was not
[33:20.720 --> 33:26.400]  at all about the sound. It was about the technology from the W1 chip to the sensors. That was expensive
[33:26.400 --> 33:30.480]  components. And if Apple could have charged less for it, I think they would have, because
[33:30.480 --> 33:33.360]  that was not a product they wanted to make margin on. That was a product they wanted to
[33:33.360 --> 33:43.040]  create market for. Yeah. I'm just imagining, I've suddenly imagined a, a idiocracy, like
[33:43.040 --> 33:52.160]  near future where Amazon has flooded the world with free Echo pucks with free offers. And
[33:52.160 --> 33:56.640]  everywhere you go, yeah, God damn things are like, would you, would you like some paper towels?
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.440]  Hey, can you turn on my lights? Sure. We can turn on your lights. We could also order you three
[34:01.440 --> 34:05.920]  more. And have you, would you like a coupon for your morning coffee? Do you need more
[34:05.920 --> 34:13.120]  trash bags? No, I mean, so that's the other thing here is that, um, privacy and security
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.040]  are also a feature. I know a lot of people just kind of lump all these products together.
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.480]  And I, I've said this before, like, I really don't, I, I, I don't want a Google speaker
[34:22.480 --> 34:26.960]  or an Amazon speaker in my house. And famously every year I buy like whatever the new Nexus
[34:26.960 --> 34:30.800]  or the new Pixel is. And I still can't use Google assistant because the first thing I
[34:30.800 --> 34:35.440]  didn't, because the first thing it does is say, can we monitor all your app and web activity?
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.200]  And I say, no. And it says, well, then you can't use Google assistant. And that's a lie.
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.480]  I could absolutely use it. They don't need that to give me basic, like to say, turn on
[34:42.480 --> 34:45.680]  my lights or something, but that's the deal. Like they don't want you to pay with money.
[34:45.680 --> 34:49.600]  They don't want you to pay with time. They want you to pay with attention and with data.
[34:49.600 --> 34:55.680]  And I, I would rather not. Um, and with Apple, yes, in some ways it's similar, but the way
[34:55.680 --> 35:03.040]  Apple treats my data and the way that it, it runs its business makes me feel more secure in having
[35:03.040 --> 35:07.520]  an Apple speaker in my house. And I'm willing, um, if I am paying a premium and I want to,
[35:07.520 --> 35:11.280]  I want to see everything about it before I say that. But even assuming I am paying a premium
[35:11.280 --> 35:14.960]  to go back to your point about the order of priorities, that's a high level priority for me.
[35:15.600 --> 35:20.720]  Yeah. And it seems to me very clear Glee and what we'll see, you know, I could be wrong,
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.760]  but it seems very clear that the number one priority of HomePod, at least this first one is
[35:25.760 --> 35:35.520]  to make awesome sounding audio and, you know, having it clever stuff happen through Siri is
[35:35.520 --> 35:39.360]  obviously on the list. I mean, and you know, there's obviously a deliberate choice to make
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.080]  Siri the interface to interacting with the device. Um, I mean, I, there's other things,
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.440]  I guess we'll find out, but you know, there's plus minus physical buttons for volume,
[35:49.440 --> 35:52.960]  but for the most part, it was a different thought process. Like it wasn't, how do we put
[35:52.960 --> 35:55.920]  Siri in your living room? It's putting this in your living. What's the best way to control it.
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.360]  Exactly. Right. And that makes it a fundamentally different product. And I can't help, but think
[36:01.360 --> 36:08.160]  that even if it is successful, meaning not successful necessarily in the market, um,
[36:08.160 --> 36:15.120]  but successful in so far as that if the product they ship is what they wanted to ship, um,
[36:15.120 --> 36:21.120]  that it might wind up being deeply misunderstood in the initial reviews because it's going to be
[36:21.120 --> 36:28.080]  compared to Alexa and the Google thing. And there'll be, uh, you know, my Alexa can do
[36:28.080 --> 36:35.600]  these 30 different things, you know, and you know, the HomePod only does two of them and yeah. Um,
[36:36.240 --> 36:42.880]  you know, you know, cons and then pros HomePod sounds more, sounds better. Um, yeah,
[36:42.880 --> 36:50.080]  yeah. I combined two, two of my items at once. Sounds better, but then another con costs double
[36:50.080 --> 36:55.760]  the price or two and a half times the price. Um, so why would I pay, you know, conclusion,
[36:55.760 --> 37:00.320]  why would I pay three times as much for a device that only does one third of the things,
[37:00.320 --> 37:06.400]  even though it sounds better. Whereas the knock that happens all the time, I can't help but guess
[37:06.400 --> 37:11.440]  that that's going to be the summary of a lot of reviews and it might actually be the sentiment
[37:11.440 --> 37:19.440]  of a lot of people reading a lot of these reviews. If what you're looking for is a, um, intelligent
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.600]  AI assistant to talk to and control stuff in your house. Whereas if what you really want is
[37:26.240 --> 37:34.320]  awesome sounding music in the, for coming in the world where, where is your music coming from
[37:34.320 --> 37:40.080]  is the cloud. Um, you might get a totally different answer. And it also on the issue of
[37:40.080 --> 37:47.840]  price, uh, in the world of people who want really, really high quality, um, or I'll just read it. I
[37:47.840 --> 37:54.320]  don't want to, I don't want to say it better. Um, guy, I know Joe, Joe Sapolsky, uh, yeah,
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.960]  you were in this thread on Twitter, but he had a good tweet. Here's his tweet. I'm not saying
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.760]  HomePod is a guaranteed success. Far from it. I'm just saying there's a much bigger,
[38:03.760 --> 38:08.560]  more established market for great sounding home stereo equipment than there is for quote,
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.280]  smart home appliances. And in that world, $350 is a steal. Now, Joe's a musician. We spend as
[38:15.280 --> 38:21.360]  much money as you have on audio. There is no upper limit, right? Uh, you know, Joe's a musician.
[38:21.360 --> 38:26.960]  He's in a band with a friend of the show, former, uh, Vesper colleague, Dave Whiskas, you know,
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.960]  so he's a musician. He's like Dalrymple, you know, he's obviously, you know, serious musician.
[38:30.960 --> 38:37.040]  You care about this, but it really is true that in the world of digital assistance, 350 sounds
[38:37.040 --> 38:43.120]  like Apple is coming in at an insanely high price. And in the world of high end home audio, it is,
[38:43.120 --> 38:48.480]  it is insanely low. Yeah. And no, and that's, and that's absolutely true. You can, you can spend it
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.160]  if you have millions of dollars, you can spend millions of dollars on home audio. There's,
[38:52.160 --> 38:56.960]  there is literally no upper limit and we've all bought good speakers over there. Like some people,
[38:56.960 --> 39:00.720]  again, they'll go and look at the box of speakers and that's fine for them. It's whatever Costco or
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.280]  Walmart or whatever is offering in a box and other people will carefully select every speaker
[39:05.280 --> 39:09.440]  and you don't get the best amplifier because they care about this stuff. But again, I think what
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.600]  Apple is also solving here is I want better audio in my house and I don't really want to fuss with
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.000]  wires. I don't want to fuss with all these things and I just want to drop it in. And Sonos was the
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.480]  first way of doing that. Sonos still has a good product. They have the Sonos One now, talk about,
[39:24.480 --> 39:28.240]  you know, new marketplace, like new competitors. They have the Sonos One now, which builds in
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.320]  Alexa. And I think it'll do Siri bridging and probably do Cortana so that Cortana and
[39:32.320 --> 39:37.840]  Alexa can talk to each other and leave you alone. But that's the solution is I, you know,
[39:37.840 --> 39:42.000]  I'm in on the Apple ecosystem. I have an iPhone. I subscribe to Apple music and I just want
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.840]  something in my house that takes care of all this for me. And that's the job you're hiring it to do.
[39:48.240 --> 39:59.120]  We've got the Alexa thing, Echo Dingus in the kitchen. And we haven't hooked up to some,
[39:59.120 --> 40:06.800]  just some lights and, and some window shades. The window shades are the main thing that I use it for.
[40:07.680 --> 40:09.920]  Which ones did you get? Cause I just, I just ordered some.
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.760]  Lytros. I don't know if that's, that's the Lutron, Lutron, Lutron. That's it.
[40:15.760 --> 40:17.520]  Yeah. That's the ones I just ordered. Serena.
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.640]  Yeah. I like the shades, but I still, I honestly, I use the buttons on the remote control as much
[40:24.640 --> 40:32.800]  as I use Alexa interface so far, but Amy's in the kitchen more than me. She plays music on it.
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.400]  I think it sounds like shit. I really do. And I don't know if, you know, in a kitchen where
[40:38.400 --> 40:42.000]  it's bouncing off tiles, it might even be more hard. So I'm really, really, I mean,
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.800]  that's the first place where, when I get my hands on a HomePod, I'm putting it in the kitchen first.
[40:47.600 --> 40:53.360]  Cause that's where we would use it more. And since it doesn't work with two yet,
[40:53.360 --> 41:00.720]  a living room might have to wait for AirPlay too. But really all she does, she plays music on it
[41:00.720 --> 41:06.000]  and she sets timers and she does like using it to set timers. Cause it's hands-free.
[41:07.200 --> 41:11.440]  And that's while cooking, but it does drive her mad. And I have to say, as somebody who cares
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.920]  about the little things, like for all the praise that the thing gets, I think that some of the
[41:15.920 --> 41:20.240]  things that it does are so goddamn stupid. It's ridiculous. Like, so like if you have a timer
[41:20.240 --> 41:26.320]  going and you check, you're like, Hey Dingus, how much time is left on my timer? It takes forever
[41:26.320 --> 41:32.880]  to get the answer. It's like, you have four minutes, 30 seconds remaining on your 10 minute
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.200]  timer. Like it's so stupid. Who would program it that way? Like if you understand the question as
[41:39.200 --> 41:45.040]  clearly as she understands the question, how much time is left? Just say four minutes, 30 seconds
[41:45.040 --> 41:50.320]  and say it a little faster. All of these things, like, uh, people get mad when I say this, but
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.640]  it's an incredibly new, incredibly nascent market. And there is no real leader yet. And then the
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.080]  core technology itself is not fully baked. Like if, if Amy's in the kitchen and she says,
[42:00.080 --> 42:04.400]  I want a scotch or something, it'll get better at understanding that she wants scotch, but it
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.960]  doesn't get better at knowing that Amy prefers scotch as a drink. Like it's context is very
[42:08.960 --> 42:14.080]  shallow, very super. All of the assistants very it also right now it responds like it'll like,
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.760]  you'll say lower the shades and it'll lower the shades. And if you put it on a timer or something,
[42:19.760 --> 42:24.320]  it'll do it programmatically, but it doesn't understand that when you wake up and you pick
[42:24.320 --> 42:28.000]  up your phone, it should automatically raise the shades or turn on the shower. Cause that's what
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.640]  you do after you read Twitter in the morning. Like they still don't have a deep understanding of us.
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.920]  So it feels like it's a fresh enough area where there's not a lot of depth yet.
[42:37.920 --> 42:45.520]  Yeah. And yeah, there's some stuff about HomePod that I think is it's not gonna, it's not the,
[42:45.520 --> 42:52.240]  you know, I'm not dissing Alexa and saying it's series coming out of the box, you know,
[42:52.240 --> 42:57.280]  to fix this and be like the iPhone, what the iPhone was to smartphones for these smart agents.
[42:57.280 --> 43:03.760]  I think it's clearly absolutely this year, not going to be that it might be a great music device,
[43:03.760 --> 43:11.600]  but it is absolutely not going to be the, you know, how 9,000 in your home that we ultimately
[43:11.600 --> 43:16.080]  want. The consensus I've heard from, you know, mutual friends who've been using it for a long
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.200]  time is that the music experience is phenomenal. And Siri for music has been, it's almost like a
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.560]  completely new Siri for music, but Siri is still limited on as you just answered me, but Siri is
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.880]  still incredibly limited. So don't go in expecting it to be, and this isn't like it'll do the HomeKit
[43:30.880 --> 43:35.280]  stuff because you, again, it's like Apple, we might as well include HomeKit. But it really,
[43:35.280 --> 43:40.480]  it really is music first. And it's interesting too, because they had SiriKit out for this. So
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.640]  it'll do things like it'll work with Notes apps, it'll work with to-do apps like OmniFocus and
[43:44.640 --> 43:49.760]  things. And it'll work with, I forget what the third one is, there's a third, oh, it'll,
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.000]  there's a third thing that SiriKit will work through. There's no SiriKit for music. So there's
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.360]  no, if you use Spotify instead of Apple Music, you're stuck. But the architecture that Apple's
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.520]  building, and Brian Romilly, who does all the voice first stuff, pointed this out to me,
[44:03.520 --> 44:07.280]  Amazon is ahead in terms of integration, but they've sort of painted themselves into a corner
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.800]  because of the system that they use. It's not, it doesn't handle differences in grammatical structure
[44:12.800 --> 44:17.520]  well. And also it doesn't handle, as far as he explained it, like if you got in on the ground
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.880]  floor and you were pizza, like you were the first developer to make a pizza, a pizza integration,
[44:22.880 --> 44:26.800]  what happens when Pizza Hut or Domino's come on? And then like some guy already owns pizza,
[44:26.800 --> 44:31.200]  like it's not clear how well it's going to scale where Apple is very, very slow with this stuff.
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.120]  And they should have absolutely had more integrations out, more SiriKit domains out
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.080]  sooner. They've built a system that will allow many people who speak very differently
[44:40.080 --> 44:43.840]  in different languages. And in some cases, even multiple languages to interface with it.
[44:43.840 --> 44:47.280]  And they're building it in a way that it'll scale as they start rolling out more and more
[44:47.280 --> 44:52.560]  of those domains. Yeah. And the other thing, I don't think that this is official. I don't
[44:52.560 --> 44:59.840]  think that they're saying this yet, but what I have heard is that, you know, for like the
[44:59.840 --> 45:06.880]  integration with things like your notes and reminders and there's third party integration,
[45:06.880 --> 45:12.080]  like they're already saying like the app, the great, great to do list app things,
[45:12.720 --> 45:19.760]  I guess is already on board with a SiriKit extension. If you want to use stuff like that,
[45:19.760 --> 45:27.040]  it only works with one Apple ID, like, so you've got to hook up your HomePod. And maybe it's me
[45:27.040 --> 45:30.480]  messages, right? That's the third one. Yeah, messages. And then they've got I think they
[45:30.480 --> 45:36.400]  got WhatsApp on board. So it's not just Apple messages. It's messaging apps can can can get
[45:36.400 --> 45:44.320]  into this. But you there's not, you know, clearly the way that this should work. I'm not saying it
[45:44.320 --> 45:51.600]  should in given the state of technology in 2018, but certainly should. Ultimately, and sooner
[45:51.600 --> 45:57.680]  rather than later, is your device should recognize who you are. I've said this before talking about
[45:57.680 --> 46:03.440]  this. I, you know, there's it, whether it's just voice alone, or a combination of camera and voice,
[46:03.440 --> 46:10.480]  but there's absolutely no doubt. I mean, and you know, the tech is there. If photos can identify
[46:10.480 --> 46:17.200]  your friends and family in your photos, the device could use the same machine learning algorithms
[46:17.200 --> 46:22.160]  to notice that it's you who are talking, right. And the same, just think about this, there's no
[46:22.160 --> 46:26.720]  reason that computers shouldn't be ultimately computers combined with hardware shouldn't be
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.880]  as good as we are of, you know, recognizing who just said something, right, when that's only true
[46:32.880 --> 46:37.440]  that right now, their personal assistants, and they need to be multi personal assistants. And
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.800]  again, another problem with Apple delaying is that in the meantime, Amazon has pushed out multi user,
[46:43.200 --> 46:48.960]  multi voice, and Google has more recently pushed out multi user, multi voice, and Nuance for years
[46:48.960 --> 46:53.280]  has been doing voice ID to the level that I think banking apps trust it now as a form of biometric
[46:53.280 --> 46:58.160]  authentication. So this stuff all works. And Apple has been working on it as far as I know, but it's
[46:58.160 --> 47:04.800]  not shipped yet. Right. So clearly, this should work where if you've configured the HomePod in
[47:04.800 --> 47:12.160]  your house with your Apple ID, and somebody else in your family has also done that. And one of you
[47:12.160 --> 47:22.560]  says, you know, Hey, dingus, remind me tomorrow when I get to work to pay Bob the $5 I own.
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.240]  It knows who said that, right in the same way that when you're you, you and I and a bunch of
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.880]  friends go out to dinner, and somebody says, Hey, can you pass me the salt that you don't say,
[47:32.880 --> 47:36.800]  okay, who wants the salt? You just give it to the person who said, like,
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.360]  if you say, Hey, dingus, read me my messages, or Amy says, Hey, dingus,
[47:41.360 --> 47:44.800]  read my messages, they should supply the appropriate messages to the right person.
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.360]  Right. And and conversely, and I'm curious how this is going to work.
[47:50.240 --> 47:56.480]  Get into 1.0 version of homeplay is that if you come over to my house, and I've got it set up for
[47:56.480 --> 48:03.680]  my thing, and you say, Hey, dingus, play my messages. Yeah, what's it going to do? I honestly
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.240]  don't even know. I have no idea on or off the record, how the hell that's going to work.
[48:09.200 --> 48:11.920]  Because you don't want it to say, Hey, is that idiot still coming over to your house? I can't
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.600]  believe exactly. I mean, it's a real disaster. Well, you know, several things like they haven't
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.320]  said anything about it working with Apple TV yet, but it is an airplay endpoint. So you'll be able
[48:22.320 --> 48:26.560]  to select it from your Apple TV as an airplay speaker, and do that. But there's no sort of
[48:26.560 --> 48:32.720]  special Apple magic there. And it's got Bluetooth 5.0. And it'll do speakerphone for iPhone, but
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.200]  Apple's not surfacing like a two dp or I forget what the new one, the new initials are. So it'll
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.600]  work as a Bluetooth endpoint for other devices. So just a lot of stuff that just seems like it's,
[48:42.240 --> 48:50.480]  it's not full yet not finished yet. Yeah. And because it is an airplay speaker, you can,
[48:50.480 --> 48:55.040]  you can just use peer to peer airplay like you can with any other airplay device. So right out
[48:55.040 --> 49:01.040]  of the box, if you want to play your podcasts, even if your preferred podcast app isn't,
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.960]  you know, magically able to just interface through the thing, you can just go from your phone selected
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.040]  as your airplay target and hit play and control it through your phone. So you will be able to use it
[49:11.040 --> 49:16.320]  as a speaker to play podcasts. It's just clearly the way this device is meant to be used is to
[49:16.320 --> 49:23.280]  tell, you know, Siri to, you know, play your podcasts. And this is the part that sometimes
[49:23.280 --> 49:28.080]  vexing about Apple. And I think the last example was the Apple TV where it took years and still
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.720]  felt not fully baked when the new version came out. And this Apple has been working on for years
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.960]  and still feels not fully baked. And yeah, there's always resource constraints, and they're working
[49:36.960 --> 49:40.720]  on multiple products and stuff. But it's clear they sort of know what it should do. Like they
[49:40.720 --> 49:45.520]  knew what Apple TV does. And Apple TV now is a two years after the new version came out. It's
[49:45.520 --> 49:50.560]  got almost everything that was glaringly missing from when they first launched it. But it's just
[49:50.560 --> 49:54.480]  getting that stuff ready so that it's there when the product ships. It seems to be a challenge.
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.480]  I guess the last point here is that Apple is playing it up as being meant for Apple Music.
[50:03.760 --> 50:09.920]  But I think I saw something that you can use it without an Apple Music subscription,
[50:09.920 --> 50:15.520]  and it will play music that you have purchased from iTunes. But I'm wondering what it will do,
[50:15.520 --> 50:23.440]  like if you have is it will it play anything that you possibly have that is in the cloud,
[50:23.440 --> 50:30.880]  you know, so with the it is also confusing to me, but I still think that, like, let's say I have a
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.880]  CD that has music on it that's never been in iTunes in the store. It's an old like bootleg
[50:36.880 --> 50:42.080]  bootleg CD of something. And I've ripped years ago, ripped it into iTunes, and I have iTunes
[50:42.080 --> 50:49.440]  match so that it's in my account. And when I get a new computer and sign into it, that song is
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.120]  those songs from that disk are available to me, even though they're not in the iTunes store,
[50:53.120 --> 50:58.240]  will those songs be available to me through HomePod? See, that was unclear to me, too,
[50:58.240 --> 51:02.240]  because we have like, again, down, Apple's got nine different versions of every Aussie song
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.360]  exactly wants to listen to a specific version. And you know, if it gets it wrong, he's he's
[51:07.360 --> 51:12.560]  marching on Cupertino. But it sounded to me because again, the language wasn't,
[51:12.560 --> 51:15.920]  at least I didn't understand the language that well. So I'm wondering if it's just whatever is
[51:15.920 --> 51:21.840]  in your iCloud music library, because that sort of supplanted iTunes match, and it includes Apple
[51:21.840 --> 51:25.680]  Music, if you have it, and I guess that's, yeah, so I guess that's what I'm thinking, not iTunes
[51:25.680 --> 51:30.640]  match, but just iTunes Music Library. And I'm hoping God, I'm really hoping that that's what
[51:30.640 --> 51:36.000]  it is. Because, boy, that would just seem, I don't see how you could excuse it. Otherwise,
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.520]  right? You've I mean, this is iTunes is a thing that Apple has been building since 2001. You know,
[51:41.520 --> 51:47.280]  that's, it's all in their court. There's nobody else to blame if that doesn't work. Right?
[51:47.280 --> 51:51.440]  Well, there's like, there's two, there's two areas here of pain, one's going to be the people like,
[51:51.440 --> 51:55.920]  like Jim, or like Andy and Akko, who have these vast collections of music that they've carefully
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.920]  ripped and catalogued and really love to hear. And then there's a whole new generation of people that
[51:59.920 --> 52:05.680]  just don't even remember what a CD is. But maybe they're all in on Spotify and not on Apple Music,
[52:05.680 --> 52:09.360]  and their pain is going to be that, yes, I can airplay it, but oh, God, it would be nice to
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.800]  have native support for this already. Right. All right, my two edges of the spectrum.
[52:14.800 --> 52:20.560]  All right, my version of the nine versions of the Ozzy song is my collection of live Rolling
[52:20.560 --> 52:27.040]  Stones performances from the 70s and early, very early 80s, where the set lists are, I don't know,
[52:27.040 --> 52:33.520]  usually about 60% overlap from, you know, VG tour to tour. So there's, I don't know, at least,
[52:33.520 --> 52:40.480]  I have at least eight different versions of Happy from Exile on Main Street. And I do want to hear
[52:40.480 --> 52:44.640]  And the new version is if Taylor Swift drops on Spotify instead of Apple Music day one, they'll
[52:44.640 --> 52:47.360]  have them, they'll be shook if it's not available to them.
[52:47.360 --> 52:52.000]  Right. Or really, I really, with those live albums, it's great to just listen to them in order
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.840]  as a concert. But they're not, I don't think maybe they've made them available, but I'm pretty
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.040]  sure they were never on Apple Music. It's like the Stones were selling them directly. And for a while,
[53:03.040 --> 53:06.240]  they were selling them through Google or something. I forget how I got them.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.760]  But apparently, the series stuff is like for music, they've done an incredible amount of
[53:11.760 --> 53:17.760]  work to make it far more robust and nuanced and capable. And it'd be interesting to see what sort
[53:17.760 --> 53:21.120]  of like, again, it's only music, and that sucks. I wish it was everything. But it'd be good to see
[53:21.120 --> 53:26.240]  what sort of the future of Siri holds as they roll that same new system out over other domains.
[53:28.880 --> 53:32.960]  Anyway, let's take a break. And I'm going to thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Away.
[53:33.920 --> 53:41.600]  Away bags and accessories are super high quality, and really, really affordable prices because they
[53:41.600 --> 53:47.280]  sell them direct to you. They use really high quality materials. So they can offer a much
[53:47.280 --> 53:52.800]  lower price compared to equivalent quality brands by cutting out the middleman without the retail
[53:52.800 --> 54:00.080]  markup. You can choose from over 10 colors and five sizes. There's the names of their sizes,
[54:00.080 --> 54:05.440]  they're very hard to understand the carry on the bigger carry on the medium, the large,
[54:06.160 --> 54:11.840]  and the kids carry on, they're actually very easy to understand. The suitcases are made with premium
[54:11.840 --> 54:17.280]  German called polycarbonate that's very lightweight, and bends never breaks.
[54:18.560 --> 54:25.440]  The interior features a patent pending compression system for 360 degrees spinner wheels guarantee a
[54:25.440 --> 54:29.520]  smooth ride. The wheels are my favorite thing about this ride this thing. I've traveled a lot
[54:29.520 --> 54:37.920]  over the last month or so had mine everywhere I go. And I constantly impressed by how smooth the
[54:37.920 --> 54:43.360]  wheels are in this thing. There's two, at least two of the terminals at Philly's airport, US
[54:43.360 --> 54:49.360]  Airways flies or American Airways as it's now known. You got to go down like a slope to get
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.320]  there actually goes downhill. The damn thing the wheels are so good that it actually it's you know,
[54:54.320 --> 54:59.440]  if you let go of it, the suitcase is just going to take off. It's so smooth. It's really, really
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.760]  that's my favorite thing about the whole thing. Even just clever little things like a removable
[55:05.760 --> 55:11.760]  washable laundry bag that snaps into place tucks away. So you can keep your dirty clothes separate
[55:11.760 --> 55:15.280]  from the remaining clean clothes living out of the suitcase while you're on your trip.
[55:16.960 --> 55:23.280]  And here's the thing. Both sizes of the carry on can charge all cell phones, tablets, e readers,
[55:23.280 --> 55:28.720]  anything that's powered by a USB cord. It's got like a, I don't know, like a 20,000 mega amp
[55:28.720 --> 55:34.000]  battery. So you don't have to really charge the suitcase very often. I go months without charging
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.040]  it months. I only charge it like I don't know, maybe like once or twice a year. You almost never
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.520]  have to remember to do it. But then anytime you sit down at the airport, just plug in a lightning
[55:43.520 --> 55:49.760]  cable and you can sit there and charge your your phone, which is to me always a huge deal at the
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.240]  airport because my phone is always super low because you get a shitty signal and there's
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.240]  thousands of other people all on their phones. And because you're at the airport, you're on your
[55:58.240 --> 56:06.160]  phone all day. Really, it's just a tremendously convenient thing. Anyway, they have a lifetime
[56:06.160 --> 56:12.000]  warranty. If anything breaks, they will fix it, replace it for free. Really just great stuff.
[56:12.000 --> 56:19.600]  I really encourage you to go check it out. They too have a hundred day trial, live it,
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.200]  vibe with it, travel with it, Instagram it, take pictures. And at any point you don't decide that
[56:25.200 --> 56:31.360]  you like it, return it for a full refund. No questions asked. They have free shipping on any
[56:31.360 --> 56:39.520]  away order within the contiguous US. Sorry, Alaska. Carry on sizes that are compliant with
[56:39.520 --> 56:46.560]  all major US airlines while maximizing the amount that you can pack. They also have retail stores
[56:46.560 --> 56:53.360]  now in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Beautiful, beautiful Austin,
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.240]  Texas. Really, I love my product. I can't remember the last time I traveled anywhere without it.
[56:59.920 --> 57:04.640]  It's just great. I really recommend it personally. I would recommend it even if they stopped
[57:04.640 --> 57:10.400]  sponsoring the show. That's how much I like it. For 20 bucks off a suitcase, visit awaytravel.com
[57:10.400 --> 57:19.600]  slash talk show awaytravel.com slash talk show and use promo talk show during checkout and you'll
[57:19.600 --> 57:28.000]  save 20 bucks. 20 bucks off awaytravel.com slash talk show. My thanks to them. You can buy
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.640]  suitcases on the internet now too, you know that, Rene. You can buy almost anything. It's an amazing
[57:32.640 --> 57:37.200]  time we live in. I just moved and I don't think I bought anything in a traditional store. Maybe
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.680]  some furniture, but almost everything else I bought, all of it was online. I buy so much stuff
[57:43.680 --> 57:48.000]  online. It has occasionally occurred to me where it's like, how the hell does retail even stay in
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.720]  business? Even though sometimes I do like to go and there are things I like to buy in person, but
[57:56.400 --> 58:03.120]  there are other things that you used to buy at the stores where I occasionally go for an in-person
[58:03.120 --> 58:08.560]  retail experience where since I don't buy any of those other things there, I don't know. I just
[58:08.560 --> 58:14.560]  wonder what the heck is going on. It's very strange. It's the same thing like the app store.
[58:14.560 --> 58:19.920]  If I know exactly what I want, I will go online and buy it, but if I'm just bored or I need to
[58:19.920 --> 58:23.680]  get something for somebody and I don't know what I want, I find it easier to just walk through a
[58:23.680 --> 58:28.880]  mall and look at things and get ideas. Yeah. Probably my favorite thing about
[58:28.880 --> 58:32.880]  actual physical retail shopping is still the serendipity of encountering something that I
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.880]  didn't even know I wanted and saying, oh, that looks interesting. I'll get that. Whereas online,
[58:36.880 --> 58:47.520]  I'm usually Target, not shopping at Target, but I'm targeting a specific product. Anything else
[58:47.520 --> 58:51.360]  on HomePod? I think we've pretty much wrapped that up until we get our hands on the damn things.
[58:52.160 --> 58:57.760]  Yeah. Again, I just encourage people if you're going to try it out, go to an app. If you haven't
[58:57.760 --> 59:02.320]  wait, look at the reviews, but then go try it out because yelling about it before you've tried it.
[59:02.320 --> 59:09.360]  Here's a good question. Here's a good question. I'm really curious how they sell this. Speaking
[59:09.360 --> 59:18.320]  of retail, what a segue. I should have a podcast. I've been thinking about this ever since June.
[59:18.320 --> 59:23.200]  How the hell are they going to sell these things in a retail store?
[59:23.200 --> 59:26.800]  I was wondering that about AirPod because that seemed like the hardest thing because how do you
[59:26.800 --> 59:31.840]  convince people about what an AirPod is because you can't just have a lineup of them on little
[59:31.840 --> 59:37.440]  strings? I don't know. At the very least, though, with AirPods, once they're in a customer's ears to
[59:37.440 --> 59:45.920]  demo, they're not blaring music in the store. The Apple stores are big rectangular spaces
[59:47.120 --> 59:55.600]  that are not really stuffed full of about 100 people, which isn't really
[59:55.600 --> 01:00:04.240]  at least much like my home. They had the Sonos stands for a while where they had
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.480]  the section of the wall that was Sonos-branded and had a bunch of Sonos speakers on it.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.360]  They've had Beats speakers set up with the Pill and other things. They've had AirPlay
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.520]  speaker setups for a while. I don't think they ever really demo them loudly, if at all.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  I really wonder. I'm really curious how they're going to do this on the retail store.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.640]  Maybe they won't. When someone asked me on Twitter, I forget who the name was, but
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.240]  will HomePod technology filter down to the Beats line the way that AirPod technology
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.920]  did? Will you be able to buy a Beats version? If you really like the Beats Pill as a mobile
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.800]  speaker, for example, will you be able to buy that with some form of this integration stuff into it?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:51.360]  I don't know. Maybe there's room underneath that $350 price tag for a Beats version. It's not as
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.400]  slick as the Apple version, but we'll recognize a HomePod there and mesh its audio with it if
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.840]  you have it in the same room, but then you can take it with you and it'll give you the Beats
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.880]  version. Do you remember? I remember in the late 90s in the CD era, maybe mid to late 90s,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.160]  where record stores started setting up things where when new releases would come out,
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:20.080]  they would have headphone stations where you'd go to station two and they would have a
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:26.800]  poster up with, here's the 10 albums set up here. You could pick from one of 10 CDs and listen to
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:32.960]  it with some pretty good headphones right there in the store. That felt so futuristic. It was like,
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:40.320]  wow, imagine this is so amazing. You can listen to a new album as long as you want of your choice
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.280]  right here before you buy it. I'm pretty sure Apple had those when they started selling
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.960]  headphones, especially with the, I don't know about the Beats stuff, but they had headphone
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.080]  sections as well where you could try them out. It's going to be interesting to see.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.760]  Anything else? I don't think so on HomePod. No, not until we get it.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:10.160]  So what we usually do, I guess in the news, I've been on hiatus for, I took a holiday hiatus after
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:19.360]  the Star Wars Holiday Spectacular. I've missed a couple of weeks here. I think the whole,
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.080]  in terms of news, I'm not going to try to cover everything. It's not really a cover
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:31.120]  everything show, but the HomePod Specter, not HomePod, Jesus, Meltdown Specter thing,
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.600]  it sort of happened while the whole, I haven't really had a show in the meantime.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.240]  Boy, what a nightmare this whole thing is. Yeah. Two critical vulnerabilities that date back to
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:50.560]  1995 for Intel chipsets and quite a ways back for ARM and AMD chipsets. And there's three
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.440]  vulnerabilities, one Meltdown, two Specter vulnerabilities. The Meltdown one Apple has
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:02.480]  patched for Mac OS now going back two or three versions, I think as of today. They've patched it
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:08.560]  in iOS 11 and Specter, Apple smartly decided not to use Intel's microcode, which is great because
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.720]  Intel yesterday said, oh, whoops, we're messing up older machines. Please don't use this. Apple
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.200]  only patched it in WebKit and Safari, which is where the JavaScript exploits could live.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:29.840]  Yeah. It really does seem like the experts, they've got a handle on, ooh, that's pretty clever.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:36.400]  That's pretty clever. And they kind of get the gist of how the exploit could work. But the
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:44.560]  understanding of how to fix it in a bulletproof way without sacrificing all of the performance
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:52.080]  advantages of speculative branching, it doesn't seem like anybody really has a full grasp on this
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:58.320]  yet. And the mitigations only address known attacks. So if there are other attack possibilities
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.280]  discovered, they'll have to add more mitigations for them. They're not actually fixing the fault.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.400]  They're stopping people from attacking those faults in known ways.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:16.800]  Yeah. I have a friend who has a couple of web servers in production. And it just seems like,
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:23.760]  and they've been updated with fixes to address this. But then ever since they were updated,
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.200]  they are occasionally just dropping off the internet and need to be removed.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.680]  Yeah, there was an epic, one of the epic games was saying that they were getting a
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.280]  horrendous, and not only a performance hit, but because they had to use more processing power,
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.880]  an electrical hit too. Like the power consumption was going way up to make up for it.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:52.160]  Right. The fixes for this are, this is so low, it really almost couldn't get lower in the chain.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:59.040]  As they say, on the silicon, getting close to the silicon. This is pretty close to the silicon.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.360]  Boy, what a nightmare. It does seem... You have to do page isolation, which adds overhead,
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.000]  basically, to prevent it from accessing kernel memory.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.880]  It seems as though Apple's products have come out of this fairly well in terms of,
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.720]  I mean, who knows if they've actually fixed what they're hoping to fix.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.800]  They're being sued anyway. Right. Oh, over this?
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:28.880]  Yeah, they're being sued over Meltdown Inspector already, because of course they're being sued.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:35.040]  I don't know. They could be sued over Tim Cook rooting for the wrong team at the hockey game
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.680]  last night at this point. Absolutely.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:46.400]  But yeah, they patched this stuff as fast as they could, prudently. They didn't
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:51.280]  sort of deploy any microcode that turned out to be... I think Linus Torvald called it garbage.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.400]  He was quite upset with Intel. And it seemed like Intel has been in ass-covering mode rather
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.760]  than fixing mode throughout most of this. Yeah. And it's surprising, because Linus
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:12.320]  Torvald usually is very diplomatic. It doesn't really speak his mind very often like that.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.960]  No, not at all. No, but it does seem as though Apple has come out of this pretty well,
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.200]  if they've fixed what they think that they've fixed. It doesn't seem like computers have
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.000]  suddenly taken a 25% performance hit or anything like that. But boy...
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.360]  No, it's workload dependent. And I think they announced that there was almost...
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.680]  Again, it depends if you're doing a lot of systems calls and what you're doing on a computer.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:38.960]  But for most, I think most common tasks, there's almost no performance hit. And I think a 2.5%
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.600]  performance hit for some of the Spectre stuff on one of three Safari benchmarks.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.360]  Right. The system cost of it. In layman's terms, I think I understand it.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.600]  But the idea is that if the kernel is always... Well, the kernel is always running. And the
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:59.840]  kernel has access to all memory, including lots of stuff that individual processes should not have
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:08.400]  access to, that a process running in user space could take advantage of the speculative processing
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.440]  and trick the kernel into going down a certain branch that it shouldn't have permission-wise.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:20.320]  And by the time the permission check happens, and you say, oh, I got to back out of that.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.440]  But as the processor backs out of that, that memory that wasn't supposed to have been accessed
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:36.320]  is in a cache, perhaps, that the user land software could, through very clever ways that
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.440]  doesn't really matter how. And I couldn't explain it because I don't understand it.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.640]  But because it's in the cache, which is accessible, they could test it and figure it out and backwards,
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.400]  back out of it what was actually in that protected memory.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.040]  The best description I heard, I forget who it was from, but that
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.320]  meltdown is like a mugging and Spectre is like a Jedi mind trick.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.760]  That's pretty good. I like that.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.920]  But yeah, and it's bad for deployments like Amazon's or Google's because you could go
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.360]  through one virtual machine into the actual machine or into other virtual machines.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.800]  Right, right. Well, all sorts of hosting services that are virtualized. Shared hosting,
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.440]  like traditional old shared hosting where you're just running as processes, or even virtualized
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:26.720]  processes, you know, servers, which is how a lot of most modern way to do shared hosting is
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.960]  where everybody gets their own version of the OS, typically Linux.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.240]  But because it's technically, it's really running on the same machine, this can be exploited. And
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.400]  that is sort of, you know, it's, I don't know, you could use all sorts of analogies, but it is
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.720]  sort of like breaking a hole in the matrix, you know, like, you know, when you're running in a
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.400]  virtualized server, it's supposed to be like the matrix where the software isn't supposed to realize
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:58.000]  it isn't running on its own machine entirely. It's supposed to, you know, think that it's,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.640]  this is the real universe. I didn't know I was in a simulated universe within a larger universe.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:09.760]  And this just pokes a hole right through it, which is really kind of breaks a lot of assumptions.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.480]  Anyway, it's kind of fascinating stuff. Good to know that there doesn't seem to have been any
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.520]  widespread exploits that have come out of it yet. But then in the back of everybody's mind,
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.760]  you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to wonder, you know, whether organizations like the
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:33.760]  NSA, and others around the world, have perhaps known about this for a long time.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.360]  Yeah, I mean, people were wondering, because what happened, Google's Project Zero discovered this,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.280]  and then in rapid succession, the University of Graz, and I forget who the third group was,
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.120]  discovered it as well. But it wasn't like it was there for 20 or so years, and then suddenly it
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.880]  was discovered. There was a Kaiser, which was page isolation, was proposed, and then there was
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.040]  an investigation was proposed, and people were like, oh, we don't need that. Thanks. It's a cute
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.880]  idea, but we don't need it. And then all of a sudden, they were like, yeah, about that project,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.120]  can we start fast tracking it? And it made people more curious. They started investigating along
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:12.880]  similar lines. Right, right. Yeah, I saw that story. It was like people who were briefed on it
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.720]  were trying to propose this thing that nobody thought was solving a problem that everybody
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.600]  thought didn't exist. And then they realized, well, wait, why? Why are they pushing this ahead?
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.760]  Well, this is a performance. Why would you really want it that badly? Okay, what are we missing
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:35.440]  here? Yeah, which was super interesting. I'm trying to think, what else in the last month of
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.000]  news? There was something yesterday. It was the day before that I just thought, and I absolutely
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.480]  do not want to pick on anybody, but I was reading Business Insider, and there was a story about how
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.880]  the Apple store was such a hellish experience. I don't know if you saw it. No, I don't think so.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:56.720]  So this reporter dropped their iPhone twice. And the first time the screen cracked, the second time
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.560]  apart fell out of the screen. So they took it to the Apple store, and they did not have an
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.400]  appointment. And they went from one play to another. And they said they'd fit them in,
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.560]  and they would replace it within two hours. So you went like to a popular Apple store,
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.880]  no appointment. It was a little bit late to be fixed. It was like, I think it took four hours
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.880]  instead of two hours, but they got their phone back that same day. And they traveled to CES,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.000]  and the phone stopped working. And at no point in the story does it say, well, I dropped it twice,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.320]  maybe that caused more damage than I originally assumed. It was like, oh, Apple must have destroyed
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.040]  it when they repaired it. So they went back to another Apple store, another really busy Apple
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.800]  store, again, didn't have an appointment, managed to get an appointment, came back, and they were
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.720]  really upset there were no lines. And that's a fair complaint. Some people prefer waiting in
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.520]  lines and just milling about. Apple seems to think people like milling about. Some people prefer lines.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:52.080]  But then they got a replacement iPhone, like the iPhone got swapped out with a refurb,
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.120]  and they left seethingly angry about what a hellacious experience this was. And by no means
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.320]  do I want to say that, I don't want to say that experience isn't, you know, they're not entitled
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.600]  to their opinion. They absolutely are. But for me, you know, if I went in, did not have an
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.720]  appointment, got my screen repaired, went back in, didn't have an appointment, got a new iPhone,
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.280]  or a replacement iPhone, at least, I think that was pretty great service. Yeah, I don't get that.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.120]  I'll have to put a link to it in the show notes. And there was also this part about, like, the Google
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.160]  Pixel, they used that as a replacement phone while they were in SES, and how great
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.880]  that was. And I have a Google Pixel phone, great phone. If I dropped it twice, I'd have no idea how
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:37.280]  to get that fixed the same day. Yeah, I think you're SOL. I've heard that they have some kind
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.360]  of mail-in thing. That's pretty good. But it's certainly yeah, but it wouldn't be that day.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.480]  Certainly very unlikely that you're going to find a first party, even third party, I don't see how
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.880]  you could expect to find one of those third party repair shops that would have a replacement Pixel
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.680]  two screen ready to go. It doesn't seem like one of those things where like, I don't know how this
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.720]  goes up on like a website, because absolutely, you can think that's a bad experience. But I
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.240]  think other people given the same information wouldn't think that and I certainly don't think
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:10.640]  it's worth castigating the company over. Right. It's like you go through it, and you could see
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:18.880]  how it could be better. It could be like 30 minute turnaround. In theory, I've only ever dropped or
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:28.880]  cracked the screen on an iPhone twice. And it was both times with my iPhone six, which unsurprisingly
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:36.560]  had a reputation for being slippery. You know, so my no case, no Apple Pay, not Apple Pay, Apple.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.160]  What's the warranty program? I don't even care. Apple Care. I haven't bought Apple Care since 1991
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.560]  on any device. Wow. Okay. The one that made me religiously, the one that made me the most nervous
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.680]  was the what was it? Jesus. It's been so long. I don't remember the number. I think it was a
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:08.080]  Power Mac 9100. Okay. That I blew like the amount of a small car on. Okay. In like 1996 when I got
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:15.680]  out of college. I've never I haven't bought Apple Pay since 1991 on my Mac LC that I went to college
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.160]  with. And so at this point, or 9600. That's Power Mac 9600. I can't believe I forgot that. Boy,
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.400]  I'm losing it Renee. My beloved Power Mac 9600 that I use for probably more than I ever use any
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:37.280]  Mac that I've ever owned. I haven't bought Apple. Apple. What's it called? Apple Care. Apple Care.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:43.920]  I can't remember. So I'm ahead, you know, like I could have a I could I could have a complete lemon
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.600]  and I could lose, you know, have a, you know, I at this point, I've bought so much stuff that I
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:59.280]  could have like a $2,500 MacBook that goes belly up two days out of warranty. And, and I'd still
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.440]  be ahead compared to how much money anyway, haven't done that's fair. Don't do it on iPhones, either
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:11.440]  because I just don't I very seldom drop them not just, you know, crack the screen, but I've had
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.760]  few drops over the years, but the iPhone six I did twice. I had dropped it, it cracked.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:24.640]  And both times I was near an Apple store and took it in without an appointment and got it. I think
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.560]  I got it back within about like 60 to 90 minutes both times. Yeah. So I could see how four hours
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.200]  would be frustrating. Because it felt like a long time to me too. But not like, you know,
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.160]  I didn't complain. I thought, hey, that's pretty good. You know, you didn't write hellish experience
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.600]  as a title on during. Well, it was funny, though. It was very funny, though, like waiting around
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.520]  to get your phone back in the store. And, you know, you could just you know, that I could go
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:56.720]  to other stores, they say it'll be about an hour. But they can't take, they can't take your phone
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:03.760]  number and text you when it's ready. Yes. Because because they have your phone. And I, you know,
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.760]  it's like come back in about an hour and check in. And I'd come back and it's like, Oh, it's almost
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.880]  ready. I think it'd be like 15 more minutes. So I just hopped on like a MacBook in the store and
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.360]  browse around and I'd see something and I would think I want to take a note to remember that and
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:24.160]  I'd go to get my phone out to note it and I didn't have my phone. It's very strange. I mean, I only
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.560]  ever damaged one for a long time. And that was an iPhone 4S that got hit by fireworks on New Year's
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.760]  and it melted the oleophobic coding. And I made an appointment took it in, they looked at it,
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.440]  they they decided to capture it, I don't think that ever seen that before. And then I got a very
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.560]  kind but stern lecture about taking better care of my belongings, really. But they replaced it
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.320]  immediately. And I used I logged into iCloud and it downloaded all my stuff and I was good to go.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.680]  And I thought that was like that was the future for me. But then this year, so I the slipperiest
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.840]  phone I've ever owned was a Nexus 4. And you could put that in the middle of a dining room table and
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:03.040]  it would fall to the floor within an hour. But I found the iPhone 8 because they have the same
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:09.840]  similar inductive charging plates on the back is also much, much more slippery than I would
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.280]  have anticipated. And so I've broken two like in the last two months. Just like I broke one the
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.200]  first day I had it, I put it down on the table, I didn't realize it was slightly on the napkin.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:24.800]  And it used the napkin as a slide and landed on a stone floor. And it didn't break the back,
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:32.000]  it broke the font, the front. And then the other one I was, I was out and I got hit by somebody
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.520]  and it sent the phone flying and it fell down and broke the front. You got punched by somebody or
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.440]  you know, I think they were just walking by aggressively. Like I was sitting I was I was
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.360]  sitting there talking and they were they just slammed into me and kept walking, which is a I
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.520]  was in the US I wasn't in Canada. I don't know if there's a difference there. But and the phone just
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:56.480]  fell down and also broke the front. And it's iPhone 8. That's just there been my pain so far.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.040]  iPhone 10 has been fine, knock wood, but iPhone 8. And I will say this, I my experience making
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.320]  an appointment at an Apple store is in especially in the last few, let's say four or five years,
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:14.400]  excellent, where they're ready for you almost on time, the amount of time it takes to diagnose
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:22.720]  slash explain slash Oh, I see. Yes, absolutely. Whatever the issue is. But I would say ideal,
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:27.280]  you know, I can't see how they would do better. They did bury making a genius appointment, which
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.480]  I hate like it used to just be you go there, you hit the genius button, and you'd be gone. And now
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.600]  you have to fight your way through three or four different layers of stuff before it lets you do
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.200]  that, which I dislike. But hmm, interesting to have it done. It's good. I wonder why they've
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.800]  done that probably. Well, I think they wanted to get rid of people who just automatically make a
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.160]  genius appointment for anything. And they wanted you to go through sort of the steps to see if you
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:50.240]  really needed one. Yeah. Because I've noticed I haven't been there a lot. I also have always
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:56.720]  been very lucky with, you know, non lemon, Apple devices, but my side, I think I talked about it
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:08.560]  in the show years ago, but my son has a same same model as me a 2013 MacBook Pro 13 inch, and his
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:16.960]  had an issue where, if he ever ran the battery down to zero, and it auto shut down, it would
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:24.720]  never turn back on, there was nothing you can make it turn back on. And first, I was like, Well, why
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:30.080]  don't do that? It was like, eventually, it happened to one time, and we got it to get back on somehow
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.600]  eventually, I forget what the deal was. And I was like, Well, don't run it down. But then he would
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:40.720]  just do it again, because he'd be like playing a game. And it was like that episode of Seinfeld
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:46.800]  where Kramer had a car where the engine, you know, the gas light came on. And he was like,
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:52.320]  let's see how far we can go. Like it was sort of like a thrill seeking. But anyway, eventually,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.080]  we took it in, and they ran some tests, and it just would not turn on, it wouldn't take a charge,
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.360]  it was just inert. And it had to be go away for it was all you know, is, you know, as bad of a
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.120]  thing as you could have, it was like the logic board had to be replaced has to be sent away,
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.360]  couldn't be done on premises. And the whole thing was fantastic. It was we were in the store for the
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:14.080]  briefest amount of time, it was obvious that something was wrong. They took it to the mysterious
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.720]  upstairs lab where somebody else confirmed Yes, this is not right. You sign out some forms,
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.720]  you sign your signature on an iPad. And, you know, two days later, they called me up and said the
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:33.600]  thing was back. Yeah. And it worked perfectly ever since. Yeah, no, same experience. I've had
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.720]  before, you know, I used to have a work Windows laptops. And when they we would pay for on site,
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.560]  the service from Dell, but it was hideously expensive. And for the people who didn't have
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:49.760]  that it was just you never knew you're gonna get your computer back. So yeah, I don't get I don't,
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.600]  I don't get our friend at Business Insider's that we said it was at Business Insider. Yeah,
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.440]  that's shocking that Business Insider find you the link. It's very shocking to me that Business
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:03.920]  Insider would run something sensationalized like that. Yeah. I had a piece yesterday got a lot of
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:09.040]  people sent good things about about the these rumors of the iPhone 10 being produced for only
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:17.440]  God. Because it's a dud because of Ming Ming Chi Kuo said people in China aren't buying the thing
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.880]  because they're they they're all they want are big screens and they think the notch is using up
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.880]  too much space and they may only sell 18 million of them and stop production in summer. It's kind
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:34.240]  of funny how this really transmogrified and I wrote about it before it had even finished
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:41.120]  spreading. Yeah. Where he writes this and Apple Insider does I one thing about these Ming Chi Kuo
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:47.600]  reports is they're not public. He's, you know, presumably they go to paid clients of his and
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:56.480]  then he seeds them to a very small handful of Mac rumor type publications like Apple Insider,
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:04.800]  security subscribers get them. Yeah. I'm curious whether they go out before he sends them to Apple
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:12.160]  Insider and Mac rumors. Because here's the thought I had yesterday as I was and I don't typically do
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:20.080]  this but I will take an aside here and just mentioned my long time thing that I have a
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:25.760]  personal policy where I don't own any stock in individual companies other than Berkshire Hathaway
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.920]  which to me is more like an index fund. The only stock market investments I have are in
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:41.280]  in index funds and I consider Berkshire Hathaway a sort of index fund. So the only way I could
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:47.760]  possibly profit through Apple stock going up would be secondhand through the S&P 500 going up
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:55.760]  which to me is acceptable. I don't know. But anyway, that's my disclaimer. I don't own Apple
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.040]  stock. I have not owned Apple stock in many, many, many, many years. And even when I did,
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.640]  it was a ridiculously small amount. But anyway, I looked yesterday after all this happened after
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:12.720]  the markets closed and the market overall was up maybe like 2% and most of Apple's peers like
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.360]  Amazon and Google, I forget who else I looked at, were also up roughly 2% and Apple was down 2%
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:28.960]  which 2% up, 2% down, that's the stock market. But at Apple's scale, that's literally billions
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:34.080]  of dollars of market cap. And I really can't help but think that the reason that Apple was
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.160]  down a bit on a day when the market was up a bit was that there were a whole bunch of
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.080]  stories about the iPhone 10 being discontinued because it was unpopular.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.520]  There's this great interview from Jim Cramer from like 10 years ago where he starts off talking
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.280]  about BlackBerry but then finishes off talking about the iPhone and he's like,
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.360]  this is how it works. I used to run a hedge fund and I know this and I don't think this is legal
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.640]  but if you've got to make your nut, this is what you've got to do. And what you'll do is
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.560]  you'll start a rumor and you'll call somebody and you know who to call and you'll get them to say,
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.640]  oh, Verizon is going to take a pass on the iPhone or the iPhone is going to be delayed
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.680]  and you start shorting and you start shorting and you get this guy to put a put on and you'll
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:17.120]  get him to call somebody else and you'll get him to say it and all of a sudden there'll be a run
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.320]  on it and you'll just move the market because that's how you got to get your money, that's how
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.240]  you got to get paid, that's what you've got to do to make everything. And he goes on to describe
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:30.400]  the entire market manipulation process of which the media is absolutely complicit because we've
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.200]  seen, there have been, in some years there are Wall Street Journal articles, no author name on
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.320]  them, no sourcing that'll just say Apple is going to not have enough iPhones or they're not going
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.360]  to have enough screens and the market will react to those and once in a while the stories disappear
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.640]  but sometimes they're left up there. And it just seems like blatant manipulation because most of
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.600]  the time the clients for these companies have been told days before and they've done like they've
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.520]  either shorted or they've bought and then the media reaction moves the market and it just it
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:06.480]  just feels like this is incredibly manipulative. I really don't think it's a conspiracy. You have
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.280]  to be conspirationally minded to think that. I really do think that there is something to this
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.840]  and that's what makes me wonder. It feels like pump and dump, like just basic pump and dump.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:23.040]  Well, that's what makes me wonder whether KGI Securities clients get these reports before
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.120]  they are leaked to the Apple press and can read between the lines of whether this is going to play
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:37.120]  as good news or bad news and make moves accordingly. That had never really occurred
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.360]  to me before as to who, whether he sends them to like MacRumors and Apple Insider at the same time
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:49.120]  or whether he sends them to them like a day later. But I don't think there's any doubt that
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:55.280]  he moves the market. He really does. Absolutely. I think at least he has his name on these things
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.840]  but a lot of them again are completely nobody knows who they are and it's important to remember
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.640]  like I won't I just won't publish them because I am not their client. They have their clients.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.200]  They are using me to achieve the ends of their clients and it is not my job to be used
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:16.240]  for their financial benefit. Yeah, but anyway I wrote about it and I think that if there is a
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.400]  kernel of truth here and Ming-Chi Kuo obviously has some good sources in Foxconn at the very
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.080]  least if not the whole Asian supply chain but his sources at Foxconn have been pretty good
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:35.280]  in many ways. You know that I would interpret this as meaning that the iPhone 10 is going to be
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:42.400]  one of the phones like the iPhone 5 like the original Apple Watch and the original iPhone
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  that only are in production for one year and that's Apple. I forgot about the Apple Watch
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.840]  but that's a good one where the original Apple Watch did not just slip down the
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.880]  pricing matrix to a second level. They actually replaced that with what they called the Series
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.760]  Zero or Series One. So we gave it that we in the press unofficially gave the original the nickname
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.840]  Series Zero. Yeah, I think that was a serenity called Will. Yeah, I think she did quite well.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:21.840]  I do think she did. Thank you serenity. And you know I think that my completely conjectural
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.800]  because Apple is you know why they do things like this are like the holiest of holy secrets
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.640]  and I think are only really ultimately known by the highest executive level. But I think it makes
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:37.520]  it's common sense to think that when they do something truly new production wise like making
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:44.160]  the first ever watch or the first ever iPhone that they learn things that they you know can
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.120]  subsequently even just in the course of 12 months do so much better that they it no longer makes
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.880]  financial sense to keep making it. You know so the original iPhone was on sale for a year and as
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.400]  soon as the iPhone 3G was ready to go the original iPhone was gone. There was no second you know
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:07.440]  you can save some money and get the year old version it was just gone. The only really new
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.840]  iPhone truly radically new iPhone in my opinion that did stay for an extra year was the iPhone 4
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:22.480]  which did two things production wise that were totally new had the glass back with steel frame
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:29.840]  frame aluminum and it had a retina screen instead of a non-retina screen. And the irony that I
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.640]  pointed out was that it was also the one with the most notorious flaw which was the attenuation
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.680]  issue. Like it was the it was of all the iPhones ever made the one that that state it also stayed
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.520]  the longest as the top tier phone because it was the one that it was the last one to ship at the
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:52.240]  end of June early July and a 4s was the first one that shifted to the fall. So it was way late in
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:29:00.000]  the fall. Right the most the most flawed iPhone and biggest PR debacle the company has ever faced
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:06.800]  was the flagship iPhone for the longest amount of time and then still remained in the lineup as the
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.480]  second cut iPhone for another year after that. So the thing that gets me is like I think and
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.760]  I think this is true for a lot of rumors is that and Ming-Chi Kuo and other people is that they
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.640]  get a little bit of information but then they spin a narrative around that information and not all of
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.480]  them seem to understand Apple very well because the narratives don't often coincide with the way
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:31.040]  Apple actually does things and then people conflate the information in their rumor with
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.160]  the context that's been invented to sort of tell a story about it and then that just it that just
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:41.280]  snowballs and in this case I think your iPhone 5 analogy is really apt because when the iPhone 5s
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.040]  came out Apple doesn't really care if the phone looks alike they had the iPhone 6 and 6s and 7
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:53.040]  and 8 all in the market at the same time but with the iPhone 5c you know it was difficult the iPhone
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:59.280]  5 was difficult to manufacture and reducing it in cost would be problematic but also it wouldn't let
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.240]  Apple reach any newer different markets where the iPhone 5c was cheaper to make and it let Apple
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.520]  test the idea of a less expensive more colorful more fun iPhone and here you have an iPhone 10
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:15.680]  which is expensive to make it uses a scarce resource like OLED and if Apple replaces that
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:20.560]  with an LED iPhone they can save the OLED supply for the new flagships but also they can make it
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.720]  slightly bigger or do whatever they think they need to test out like whether it is China or
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:31.920]  something else to test out a slightly different form factor yeah well the funny thing to me is
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.200]  how this that there's that old kids game whisper down the alley or whatever it's called where
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:41.920]  broken telephone broken telephone where it's kids line up in a row and you're supposed to whisper
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.320]  as quietly as possible somebody starts with something and then you know 20 kids in a row
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.120]  one kid whispers it to the next and you're split in in good faith you're supposed to try to whisper
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:58.640]  it to the next person as accurately as possible I distinctly recall as a child purposefully
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.920]  mangling it in a humorous way don't invite John Gruber to your game of broken telephone
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:12.240]  um but even when kids try to do it honestly it is kind of funny how it comes out wrong at the end
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:20.080]  and it's really this story in particular quickly got wrong where the original report for Ming Chi
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:29.280]  Kuo is the fact he reported was that he thinks Apple might stop production of the iPhone 10
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:37.600]  this summer in the lead up to the new phones which I would fit exactly with what you know
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.000]  not that they would stop selling it he's he's completely writing from you know that at some
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:50.320]  point in July Foxconn can stop making iPhone 10s and focus on iPhone 11s or whatever we're going
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:56.720]  to call them and they'll Apple will still have these iPhone 10s that had been made through July
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:03.680]  to sell through mid-September when they switch to the new product line where the iPhone 10 doesn't
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:11.360]  exist that's what Ming Chi Kuo wrote that's what I Apple insider I believe accurately summarized
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.880]  but I can't prove because I don't have Ming Chi Kuo's report it matched what macrumors wrote which
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:24.400]  I think means it's pretty it's pretty consistent this was it was then uh it was then taken up by
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:30.800]  somebody who made it see at Newsweek who made it seem as though the iPhone was being discontinued
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:37.360]  now and they'd stopped selling it in the summer and we'd go uh you know like in the mid-summer
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:42.080]  there would be no more iPhone 10s to buy and that new iPhones wouldn't be ready yet because that's
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:48.240]  how badly the iPhone 10 was selling so I don't think it makes more sense to stop selling it
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.560]  right and then it went it got to the point where the just the summary of the story was that Apple
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:58.000]  is right now in the midst of canceling the iPhone 10 and I this is a true story horrible about that
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.200]  too you may not have seen it I wrote this story on Daring Fireball right before we recorded and
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:08.640]  published it but I literally read it there's a great contractor we've had working on and off
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.920]  in our house a guy named Wayne really nice guy does good work sort of a technical enthusiast and
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.320]  you know one day he was you know here and and he was doing work in my office and my office is
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:25.760]  it looks it looks like a you know it probably doesn't really look like an Apple store because
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:32.240]  it's it's not very well organized but it certainly looks like maybe I robbed an Apple store in terms
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.080]  of the number especially a couple of months ago when I had the boxes of I you know multiple new
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:45.440]  iPhones out on my desk and he's like what do you do and you know told him and he was kind of
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:52.560]  intrigued by it he's sort of a gadget you know a regular person gadget nerd and he was here today
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.760]  and you know it's like you know ding dong here he is the doorbell hey how you doing Wayne good to
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:03.760]  see you John you know something about the Eagles being in the Super Bowl you know friendly chit
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:09.040]  chat and then he's like hey what the heck's the deal with this thing I saw yesterday where the
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:14.400]  iPhone 10's been cancelled is that legit and I was just blown away you know that this could not be a
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:24.160]  more regular person and he's heard that Apple is canceling the iPhone 10 like crazy it's absolutely
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.920]  insanity I saw people on Reddit asking like oh they're Apple's canceling the phone is that
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.480]  are they going to take my phone away will they repay me and this is how people react to those
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.560]  kinds of stories and they don't they're not stupid they're just not you know they don't understand
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:42.160]  when they use headlines what it means to them and they start to panic right it really is like the
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.520]  the headline you know everybody talks about fake news and fake stories and and truly out you know
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:53.600]  truly you know this nobody really lied here although I would say there's some mendacity
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:35:00.320]  involved in I think purposeful exaggeration especially in the headlines and I really I cannot
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.720]  emphasize enough for people who don't think about this because you know you're not in the business
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:10.240]  of writing headlines but headlines have always been important even in the print world uh you
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.040]  know and you know on magazines they sell the magazines right so there's always you know the
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:21.520]  the the pre-digital equivalent of of clickbait is uh you know salacious headlines on on the
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.440]  magazines or a newspaper tabloid uh to sell copies right like oh you know there's you know
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.920]  an exaggerated sensationalist headline but people bleeds it leads dog bites man bites dog all that
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:40.400]  stuff right but even then you're not a click away right like even if the cover of the New York Post
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.320]  has you intrigued enough to say ah damn it I'm buying a copy you've still got to wait in line
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:49.600]  you got to reach in your pocket and get 50 cents out and hand it over and you know you're buying
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:54.240]  you're not just you're not just dipping your toes and you're picking up a whole 85-page newspaper
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:59.920]  you know what I mean uh whereas a click is always you know you're just a click away you can just
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:03.840]  touch it just touch just touch just tap here tap this tap this tap this listen to the tablet
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:09.280]  is at the end of the of the supermarket line right except that you can you're just a towel
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.440]  all you have to do is touch it just touch just touch this spot touch this spot on the you know
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.240]  and your thumb is already just an inch away just move your thumb one inch and tap this and we'll
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:26.000]  explain this seemingly impossible headline away that the iPhone you know mighty apple
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:36.960]  incorporated is canceling their supposedly best product ever made and it's it but it you know it
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:44.480]  it seeds these you know I I know meme the word meme has sort of been uh co-opted to mean these
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.480]  graphical animated gifs with uh headlines underneath but the you know going back to
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:56.080]  you know going back to richard dawkin's original definition of just the way that an idea can sort
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:04.000]  of spread through a culture uh you know what I mean it's not even like a story it's not like
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.120]  there's it's just that headline just the notion of apple has cancelled the iphone 10 which is
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:19.120]  preposterous yeah and no absolutely I told and I also thought it was interesting that uh my
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.640]  contractor friend Wayne he he has he he has quite the way he posed it to me he was like that that's
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.240]  not right is it you know like he knew to be skeptical you know what I mean it wasn't like he
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:35.840]  was fooled so it's not the the problem isn't that people like Wayne have been tricked into thinking
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.160]  it's true that apple cancelled the phone they're you know because he's not dumb he just isn't
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.920]  deeply involved in this it's just something he cares about tangentially and because he's not
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:56.000]  um uh because he's actually you know a smart uh you know good bright guy he knew to be skeptical
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.800]  but he just didn't understand how to square the two things like he knows this doesn't sound right
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.520]  but that's what people are saying that's the essence of fudd it's fear uncertainty and doubt
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.560]  they're fearful that it might be true they're uncertain whether it is or true or not and so
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.280]  start to doubt you know what they think is real and it's a huge problem remember my mom once called
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:17.680]  me she said i was watching bbc and they said that the iphone had been hacked and because like i do
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.120]  what i do i knew what the story was and it was if you you know if you went to a uh if you joe broke
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.920]  your iphone and you went to a specific chinese cracked iphone app store and you downloaded
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.360]  certain apps and you were a journalist they were trying to target you um with malware and it had
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.280]  nothing to do with anything that would affect anyone else who was an apple customer but the
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:43.280]  bbc ran it as though the iphone was hacked and another major blog said that apple's you know
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.120]  apple's uh unblemished security record is now broken but you know it was never not broken and
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.680]  it wasn't broken now uh but this is the narrative that people are getting fed and then they people
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.480]  who are already worried about technology who don't find it accessible or who think it's scary they're
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.280]  just made more afraid and you're you're literally victimizing people who would benefit from the
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:09.360]  technology do you do you read uh i i love it i've used it for years i have so many years like i
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.840]  don't even remember how long but the website techmeme just i don't know if it's because i
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:22.160]  thought of the word meme or not but techmeme is sort of an aggregator of nerd tech industry news
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.840]  um gabe revera is the founder i haven't seen gaben years but i i know gabe a little bit
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:34.720]  um and and the gist of it is they if you've never been there go to techmeme.org i find it to be a
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:40.720]  terrific way to just get a snapshot of uh hey has anything big happened especially like when
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:46.880]  i'm traveling if there's a day when i'm busy and i haven't checked anything in a while uh just
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.840]  quick look at techmeme and scroll down a bit from the top and it's a good way to sanity check have
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:57.600]  i missed anything big that i really need to know about a daring fireball nope or yes look at that
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.760]  wow uh i need to take a break here and go look at it um and it you know ranks things i don't know
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.320]  what quite the algorithm is but anyway a couple of years ago techmeme switched from running the
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.560]  original publications headlines to rewriting them editorially good old-fashioned human
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:25.280]  human writing um and a lot of publications really got pissed off about that uh
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.400]  well it made them verbose enough to tell you everything about the story and the headline
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:34.800]  which they thought would limit click-through yeah and you know oftentimes but but if you're if
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.640]  your headline if that's how much could be if that's how much news is in your story really
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.160]  who's at fault there uh yeah well if you're not adding value beyond the facts then you know it's
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.720]  not their fault the abuse of headlines i i can't get off i can't overstate uh just how bad of a
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:58.320]  problem it is in my opinion you know and and techmeme goes to the opposite measure of actually
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:05.360]  rewriting them out of respect for the visitors to techmeme's time and attention yeah there's a
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.920]  great twitter account i i forget the name of it i think it's called saved you a click yes
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:20.960]  it's so great and uh like i saw one today where it was like uh it's often movie news but they've
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:27.760]  just in other words they'll take a totally salacious tweet or headline and just quote it
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:33.600]  in a tweet and then tell you and usually in about five words what the story actually is saved you a
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  click yeah and it was one it was like uh the russo brothers uh talk about um the uh uh what's the
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:49.280]  movie with scarlet johanson where she she's a superhero uh um the black widow or the black
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:57.120]  widow black widow movie the black widow movie and uh this the saved you a click summary of the
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.160]  entire story was they're very excited to work on it yeah and you know that that's the whole story
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.000]  like what are they going to do are they going to have a love-hate relationship with saved you a
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.680]  click because there are some writers who are really good and i want to go on that ride with
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.240]  them like they're teasing out a headline telling you a phenomenal story and then they'll zing you
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:19.360]  at the end almost like a like an m knight shalom movie at its at its finest and then it like they
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.440]  just said darth vader is his father i'd be like ah damn it i wanted to go on that ride but there
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.040]  are a lot of cases where there really is nothing else and they do save me a click so you're saying
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.840]  that they're not quite they're not quite judicious enough in who they go after yes in terms of going
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.320]  after if it's a really yeah and yes it depends on the quality of the writer but i think there
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  are some writers out there that deserve to the experience of revealing what they want to say
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.840]  and there are others that are just trying to steal your attention and i think there's a lot of
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:52.400]  line between the two uh i don't think we're going to get to our year 2017 year in review but we
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.760]  could try to squeeze it in in the last few minutes of the show but in the meantime let me thank our
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.720]  third and final sponsor of the week squarespace look you need to make a move you need to make a

[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.800]  in a row where you've come on at the end of the year and and we've done like a year in review
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.120]  and i ran out of time last last december so we didn't do it but here you are in the first
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:13.760]  episode of 2018 we could we could we could whip through it yeah totally i mean not much happened
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:23.360]  right yeah uh i i i don't have notes on this what do you think what's your high level takeaway of
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:28.560]  the year that apple had the year of the industry one of those years yeah you know i'm not sure if
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  i prefer it or not but it was one of those years where apple didn't have a march event and we
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:37.040]  gotten used to having them again because they had a series of events for like the 12-inch macbook
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:42.880]  and apple watch uh and the iphone se and the you know the the closest we got was the product red
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.720]  iphone which wasn't an event it was just sort of pushed out there but we waited till wwdc to have
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:54.000]  any sort of apple before apple took the stage at all and then when they did we got like a plethora
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.680]  of things we got all the uh kb lake the macbook the macbook pro the imac pro was was shown off
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:07.280]  the home pod uh was shown off and i know people are are wondering why it was showing off so early
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.320]  uh you know why those platforms so early if they're going to ship in september but you know
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.760]  they've done that in the past um and we got all the new operating systems and it was just it felt
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.640]  like we went so long without it and then everything was just slammed onto us all at once my high high
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:30.720]  level takeaway of 2017 is my i don't know if it's my primary interest in the company but it certainly
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.440]  is if it's not number one it's very very close but it's probably number one and it's selfish
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:45.120]  and very selfishly everything i've done professionally in my life other than the high
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:54.880]  school job i had stocking shelves in a supermarket slash pharmacy uh and scraping gum off the tables
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:01.760]  of my school when i was in 10th grade during the summer uh and cutting the grass i've done with
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:16.000]  with a computer and 99.999 of that work was on apple computers um i i you know not through luck
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  but through actually choosing what i do uh i i've spent other than some internships in college to
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.760]  really spend very little time needing to use windows professionally and that was by choice um
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:39.280]  and i see 2017 as an interesting year for apple as the maker of machines for creative professionals
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:48.880]  where i do think that they drop the ball on the latest macbook pros i just there's no question in
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:55.600]  my mind there's certain aspects of them that are debatable like hey maybe they didn't need to make
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.720]  it any thinner i would just wish that i wish it was the same thickness before as before and just
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:06.320]  put more battery in there debatable uh i can see why other people would say this is amazing it's
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.360]  as thin and light as a macbook air but it has a retina screen in its performance but the keyboard
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:18.960]  is undeniably uh a step backward it is failing for people there's too many people who they're
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:28.160]  getting keys stuck and that's just uh the keyboard has to be reliable it absolutely has to be and i
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.280]  like to get a mac and use it until i feel like it's really problematic so i've still got my
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:41.920]  i'm recording right now using my 2013 macbook pro that i bought with a core i7 and you know maxed
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.440]  out the ram at 16 and all you know big one gigabyte ssd and the thing still runs really
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:52.400]  really well so i wasn't in the market for a new one but boy ever since this report of the unreliable
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:59.360]  keyboards has broken out uh you know and really become well known you know months ago every time
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:05.040]  i'm traveling or other you know otherwise using my macbook pro for work and i'm writing and you
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:11.840]  know guess what i write a lot uh i keep thinking about how i've never had a macbook or power book
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:17.440]  or an iBook that had a keyboard that i didn't trust a hundred percent and how frustrating i
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.600]  would find it to have a keyboard that wasn't a hundred percent reliable like a hundred percent
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:32.800]  a hundred percent i've had this machine now for over four years uh and i don't think i've ever
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:41.040]  once tried to type a letter on this keyboard and not had the key that i thought i was pressing
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:48.400]  register the key in the software i was typing like no i'm sorry i say 2013 i just checked it's
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:56.560]  mid-2014 2014 so it's a year and so is my son's the lemon uh that was fixed uh i misremembered
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:00.720]  good thing i went to the about box wouldn't want to get that wrong um so it's a three-year-old
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:08.320]  computer but literally however many keystrokes i've typed since sometime in the second half of
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:16.480]  2014 when i bought it and it became my personal laptop it is literally at 100 as to my knowledge
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:20.960]  i've never once tried to type a k and not had the k register or had the k stick or something like
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:26.880]  that anything less than that is unacceptable to me i really so i really think they have a problem
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:33.680]  there with the keyboard i also think that as the as we stand right now i think that the touch bar
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:41.120]  is not good enough i think there's way too many people who don't like it at all and way too few
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.280]  people who have good things to say about it it's hard for me to judge because i only used it for
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:50.000]  like two weeks while reviewing them and i was intrigued by it but it still seemed like this
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:55.520]  is really cool idea let's wait and see how it shakes out in software and it seems like the
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:01.200]  way it's shaken out is that people don't really care care for it or love it so i i'm very similar
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:06.080]  to you and i have that exact same macbook pro like the 13 inch from 2014 and i i loved it it was a
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.840]  computer it was probably my favorite computer because i vacillated between the macbook pro
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:13.200]  and the macbook air in terms of power and portability and that one really felt
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:16.720]  like it had it all but i'm different in that i've been using the 13 inch with touch bar
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:23.920]  since it came out since the the very first time it was available and um i have two thoughts about it
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.640]  one is i vastly prefer the keyboard on the new macbook pro to the previous ones but i know i'm
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.920]  that you know not everybody thinks that and apple is the only manufacturer of macbooks so you cannot
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:38.240]  have a product that's divisive you can have people who like one keyboard more than the other but if
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:42.960]  you have a large portion of your customer base who actively hates that keyboard that's a problem
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.160]  because they have nowhere else to go and the failure thing is just not debatable i've had
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.600]  i have had keys fail on older macbooks but they were super easy to either clean or replace like
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:58.560]  just trivial and this one is absolutely not this is an expensive repair yeah and let me just
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.600]  emphasize that i've it's not that in my life i've never had a key go bad on any apple laptop i mean
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.400]  uh i think i had a white i the one i know i had a white iBook the 12 inch white iBook and i think
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.480]  it keys got a little squishy but it was they were fixable i didn't have to go to a store i could you
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:18.000]  know jimmy it with a pocket knife or something i'm just saying but i'm saying that the 100 record is
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:24.960]  with this particular macbook pro from mid-2014 that i fastidiously never eat food around um
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.600]  which my son does i'm a filthy blogger so i mine is just like just waiting my my son's keyboard
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:39.360]  is like oscar the grouches keyboard it's really kind of you know it's really kind of astounding
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:44.160]  how i i but you know what's funny though it's in its stick like it would drive me crazy like
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.160]  you know he's got keys that to me stick but they they don't stick stick they just don't click
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.120]  right but it actually works if you just trust that what you think you're typing you're typing
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:01.200]  and look at the screen it actually works even though it feels uh it makes me sick but anyway
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:07.360]  i love them i think it's a problem and i also think it's interesting on the flip side
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:14.320]  um for professional work you've got it was a big big year for ipad pro
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.160]  but before we move on from the macbook pro the one other thing that i wanted to say about this is
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:23.920]  this is one of those things where data you know people talk about data a lot but data
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:28.960]  is nothing without analysis and apple has a ton of data about what we buy we literally
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:33.760]  vote with our wallets for everything that apple does and people uh people don't buy
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.400]  desktops when they do buy desktops they buy imax but they don't buy desktops they buy macbooks
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.480]  and macbook air is super popular and everything apple is telling them including the success of the
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:47.360]  ios devices is that the lighter and more mainstream they make these products the more they will sell
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:51.840]  and we've even like despite people really not liking these macbooks they're incredibly popular
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:56.240]  and you could say that there was like a hunger or a thirst or there's no alternative but it's also
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:01.040]  possible that apple is making more mainstream macbooks but they did it at the expense of the
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:05.600]  pros instead of adding a product like they it's great that they had the macbook escape for people
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.680]  who didn't want everything else but they didn't have a macbook pro pro the way they have the imac
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:14.800]  pro that was sitting on top of the line that was there for the people who really wanted high memory
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:19.840]  high power high processing and didn't give a crap if it had battery life or thinness at all
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.720]  i think that missing product was i think if they just if they'd had that extra one on top the way
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:27.680]  they had the extra one on the bottom we wouldn't have seen anywhere near the negative sentiment
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:33.120]  we got yeah i think i that's a fantastic point um i wish i had put it in a note so i would have been
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:38.000]  sure to make it but you made it well but i think you're exactly right that they should in theory
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:51.360]  there should be what what what the current thinner macbook pros are to the imac there should be like
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:56:00.800]  the 5k imac there should be something that is like the imac pro or and or mac pro and and it's like
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:08.320]  these are really a macbook air pros yeah we got yeah and you know it names names matter but i
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.200]  think if you've put names aside and you know i don't know what you'd call it somebody they could
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:22.640]  come up with something but there should be a you know thicker heavier more usb ports uh pro you
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:30.320]  know things that you know it the pro word is so problematic and i see so many columns and listen
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.720]  to so many podcasts where i get frustrated because it it's like almost like if you took the word pro
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:43.120]  off the macbook pro like you said just call it like the new macbook air i i or just you know
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:48.960]  or if they just like iphones just put the word macbook on all of them whether it was the the
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:56.000]  macbook one port the macbook pro whatever uh i think you can easily get lost in the weeds by
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.360]  defining pro as professional and because the different people who make their living on it in
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.800]  a professional sense do it in so many different ways right there are people who literally don't
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.080]  need any of the ports there are people who can use it all day long and get terrific battery life
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.880]  with exactly the thinness and who really appreciate how much thinner it is and lighter to
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.880]  carry around and there are people who are like who i would call new generation pros who they're
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.840]  they're entrepreneurs or they're doing they're doing a running a business and to them they they
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:34.400]  consider themselves pros the same way that people old school would be like designers or renderers
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.560]  or anything and you also have the other end of the scale where you have people who almost see like
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:43.280]  apple is taking fire from on high and giving it to the masses and how dare these people be pros
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.360]  only what i do is pro and there's assholes on both sides that argument but in the middle there's a
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.840]  bunch of people being underserved yeah and i you know i appreciate that frustration of wow they
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.440]  used to make a machine that had plenty of ports that i used and now i can't get one unless i buy
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.040]  like the old you know you know i can't get the new one with the ports that i use and i'm stuck using
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:09.040]  these dongles and i thought about it too because i've always had to use dongles like i had to use
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:14.720]  dvi dongles and firewire dongles and all sorts of things but i realize a big difference here is that
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.120]  us usb was never one of the choices they had to make it was always the fringe stuff that i used
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:23.840]  dongles for like thunderbolt or something and usb is something everybody needs so now the dongle is
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:29.680]  everybody's problem and not just the nerd niche sort of problem yeah it's you know i i used to
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:35.280]  roll my eyes at people barking about sd card slots because i was shooting with a canon and i
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.480]  had a cf card so i needed the dongle anyway and then i bought a Fuji x100s and i could just plug
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:46.880]  the sd card right into my macbook and it's like hey that's pretty cool like yeah i'm not angry
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:52.400]  that they don't have sd card slots on the new ones but i'm kind of glad that i'm still using one that
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:58.480]  has one yeah so anyway until you need it anyway i do think you're right though i think i trust
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:06.320]  apple to listen i also know that you know there's an awful lot of people at apple itself who use
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:12.240]  macbooks including you know people like tim cook and phil shiller who if their keys get stuck
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:20.240]  they're gonna they're they might bring it up yeah uh yeah and also their whole all their engineers
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:23.600]  and all their software and hardware engineers use macbooks every day and they need them to work
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:30.800]  i also think and i'm kind of excited about it i think that apple could appreciate that hey we
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:39.760]  didn't hit it out of the park with the first touch bar and and rat you know i you know not to call
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:47.520]  him out but i think i think marco armand on the the atp had said like his wish would be for apple
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.960]  to say you know what we tried it it wasn't a good idea we're we're you know next macbook pro you can
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.720]  buy it fully specced you don't have to get the lowest n1 you can get any of them without it
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:03.040]  i would rather see apple say you know what wasn't good enough let's make it better let's do one
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:09.600]  let's do a 2.0 touch bar that people do want to give up the old style function keys for
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:17.440]  maybe yeah it's interesting because maybe with a hardware escape key no but which is a ridiculous
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:23.120]  idea which i don't think is a ridiculous idea to have a button on the top right for touch id and
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.040]  an escape key on the left and just do the touch bar in the middle but that's the thing so you
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:29.840]  could also you could just call the home button if you want to make it super friendly for people it
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:34.960]  doesn't really matter but is touch id long for this world like if we go to phase id right does
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:39.680]  that disappear that's the most compelling part about the touch bar like i use a touch bar um
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.080]  as a shortcut because i can i can just swipe across safari tabs faster than i can actually
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:47.920]  find the safari tab i want with the keyboard yeah and there's all sorts of things that i can do
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.360]  that's just quick on it but i use that touch id thing all the time i did i did too and it was
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:01:00.000]  it was the single thing i i hated giving up from the review unit that i had but i also think now
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.240]  several months into the iphone 10 lifestyle that there's no doubt in my mind that uh the touch id
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:16.320]  is not long for this world and on a macbook in particular it seems face id would be way way more
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:22.720]  better than touch id than it even is on the phone and i clearly think it's better on the phone but
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:29.360]  in terms of like getting an angle and uh working with you know being completely uh
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:35.440]  i want to say ambidextrous but uh you know not not biased towards the right side on your right hand
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.240]  i mean windows hello works now without any of the technology apples applying to it it would
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:46.640]  just be a fantastic product right and you know it's you've got some time when you open a macbook
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:53.120]  and you know there's some time there where face id can already register you where it it you know
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.520]  unlike the phone where you can make arguments about which is faster by the stopwatch it'll
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:03.840]  should clearly be faster on a macbook opening it from a closed position anyway i so i think it's
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:10.720]  funny that to me the best part about the touch bar uh system on the current macbook pros is the
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:18.160]  touch id sensor which i think is likely going away i don't know when but uh anyway i want to
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:22.080]  move on to the ipad side of things which and i think it was a very interesting year for the ipad
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:31.200]  pro because i think we saw you know the most serious attempt at and making ipad running on
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:38.800]  our ios running on ipads more like uh several steps closer to what would this be like if it was
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:46.080]  primarily for ipads and not secondarily for ipads like an ipad os rather than a vanilla ios right
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:54.240]  vanilla ios right and i liked all of the ideas i liked the the the i liked the list of problems
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:02.720]  they were trying to solve it all seemed there wasn't any aspect of it that i would think
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:08.000]  i i say that i say this you know guardedly because i don't use an ipad pro for a lot of work
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.800]  so i'm judging it sort of as a tourist but i liked it and you know and as a you know user interface
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.440]  critic but then as time wore on and they settled in i still think the biggest problem isn't that
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.800]  they didn't come up with good ideas but that it still doesn't go nearly far enough yeah in terms
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:30.720]  of things that i find so convenient and so quick and so easy to do with almost without thinking
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:39.120]  about it on a mac which feel like i'm doing surgery on somebody with chopsticks when i do it
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:46.400]  on an ipad yep no i ran into i was working on an ipad pro i used when i when i travel and i was
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.240]  working on it the other day and i was trying to get the images off of apple's newsroom and what
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.920]  i couldn't just touch on it because it's got that over effect where it will give you the this the
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.160]  social sharing stuff and then i tried to download it and it was a zip file i could have opened an
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:04.240]  app to do it but i just realized that using apple's default tools i couldn't use apple's
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:08.320]  default website and i pulled out i just got upset and i pulled out my mac and i did it in three
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:13.920]  seconds right and those sort of problems that can that need to be solved and as much as people talk
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.720]  about sort of adding parts of ios to mac like touchscreen max it's much more interesting to me
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:24.560]  to see apple continue to bring up the ipad and consider things like we've got basic trackpad
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.520]  support already but what happens if they make the surface of the smart keyboard uh capacitive and
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.840]  you can move your fingers over that in lieu of a trackpad for example if you don't want to touch
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:39.280]  the screen i think there's a lot of ways they could take that further yeah uh the precision
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:46.400]  mousing gets me i i have a long list of things that that if i use an ipad pro for an extended
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:52.800]  period of time eventually make me get itchy to go back to a mac and the lack of precision mousing
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:05:01.920]  largely for text editing is as you know is high on the list um so i really hope that this but wasn't
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:10.720]  like apple's okay you guys want some pro features in ios for ipad here okay now shut up i really
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:16.880]  hope it was more of a first step in a multi-year process of doing making significant strides in
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:23.680]  that regard um and i still feel like it was like i i also still feel like there are some
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:28.640]  aspects of that interface that are problematic i still i i've been suspicious all along of the
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:34.160]  lack of an indication of where keyboard focus is you know let's say you have two apps up split
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:42.080]  screen i kind of i do like the tidiness of like split screen stuff on ipad uh being like it's
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:48.320]  perfectly 50 50 or perfectly two-thirds one-third and you know and then i look at my mac and i see
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:55.200]  this jumble of overlapping windows and there's a tidiness there that i like but it's like i cannot
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:00.400]  believe that that in this interface you have two apps up side by side you could be typing in either
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:05.520]  one and you don't know which one you're typing in until you start typing i find that crazy waste a
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:12.160]  step yeah yeah no absolutely um i think to me this was a second step like we saw ios 9 take the first
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:16.480]  step when it introduced the split screen stuff and they were working on drag and drop for a while and
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:21.520]  couldn't ship it in ios 10 shipped on ios 11 um and you know again they have certain amount of
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:25.360]  resources and they'll they'll focus those on certain features and maybe we'll get more with ios
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:30.000]  12 or maybe we'll have to wait and it'll be every two years we take a big step forward in ipad but
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.760]  i think it's inevitable that we're going that way i think there was a sort of a difference of opinion
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:40.080]  inside apple as to whether ipad should be left as an incredibly approachable device for mainstream
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:45.280]  people or whether it should be allowed to be a more powerful machine for pros and i think there
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:49.840]  was a second disagreement about whether it was just adopting mac tropes or whether it was
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:54.880]  rethinking them the way like like drag and drop on ipad is is not just porting over the mac drag
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:58.960]  and drop it was rethought and i think that's the side that that's gaining traction is that it
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:02.560]  should be allowed to be a pro but we're not going to just make it a mac we're going to we're going
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:06.880]  to make technology evolve in a way that makes sense to ipad can i tell you i spent some time
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:12.960]  over the holidays using an ipad more specifically for this reason that i was taking a break you know
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:19.520]  break from the podcast doing less work you know trying to you know have a holiday a real holiday
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.920]  and you know what you know it's a good device for that and you know i felt like i wanted to spend
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:27.760]  more time with it but i'll tell you what the drag and drop thing really gets me because let's say
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:33.920]  i want to uh tap on something in safari like a link and i want to copy it and you used to just
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.960]  tap and hold and you'd get a little pop up and then you tap copy and now you tap and hold and
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:47.280]  it jumps up off so you can drag it and you have to wait longer before i can copy uh whereas on a mac
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:54.080]  i would just uh control click or two finger click on the link depending on you know whether i was
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:08:00.800]  using a um and it would and the copy you know the menu of options to do on this link would be
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:06.320]  instantaneous so the old way on the ipad was a little bit of a weight which annoyed me from my
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:13.280]  wanted instantly mac instincts and the new way is an even longer wait and it's one of the tricky
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:20.000]  things that i think people don't think about when they think in vague yada yada yada terms ah
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.480]  i'll bet apple's just going to unify all this in one os right and you don't think about things like
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:35.280]  if you just tap your finger on the screen and move it what happens does it scroll the view
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:43.040]  like in a safari window or does it select the text right so when i click in a safari window
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:50.000]  i click and move my finger it selects text instantly no wait no modes just selects
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:58.560]  how do you do that on a touch screen so that you could select text instantly or double click to
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:04.480]  select a word instantly but still allow you to touch instantly to an instantly begin scrolling
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:09.600]  it can only do one thing and i think it was a good decision collision a lot of collision it
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.840]  can only do one thing first i just don't think people think about that and those delays like
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:18.640]  waiting to get the copy menu just to copy a link that's right here that i would have copied a
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:25.120]  whole second ago right yeah i mean but that second feels like forever well there's like this weird
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:29.280]  there's weird mutation of fitz's law that i find with pressure sensitivity and you know fitz's law
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.760]  for people aren't familiar with it it's like the the the easiest way that you can get to an area
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:39.280]  on a gooey like the throw distance and for me it's like there's pressure for fitz's law it's
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:43.920]  like the harder press the harder press is the easier one if i have to stop and do fine manipulations
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.480]  like that's why i hate floating um floating capacitive screens because it's just hard to
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:52.320]  float your finger without touching the screen but it's easy to jab the screen and when people aren't
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:56.000]  certain i feel like they jab more and then on an iphone you risk like if you just want to make this
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.760]  tough jiggle in the old interface you would have to hold it and not press hard if you pressed hard
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  you do 3d touch that's not what i wanted you let go you did again oh god 3d touch again and this
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.320]  is the same thing i just want to copy this oh god it's floating now oh i want to i let go i'm
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:12.640]  floating it again and i just want to copy it and you start to get frustrated with it and it's not
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:17.440]  like it's not like it's it's easy to do that fine control for everybody and it just it ends up
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:23.760]  feeling like it's just like everything the whole system is overloaded yeah i so i i i i really do
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:29.200]  feel as a high end you know where's apple going what apple did last year i really feel like i
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:32.640]  i mean it's already too late if they haven't been doing it all along so it doesn't really matter if
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:37.280]  people at apple are listening to us um like nothing's going to happen between now and june
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.480]  if they haven't been working non-stop since last june on what ios 12 could be on an ipad but boy
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:50.320]  i sure hope that there's engineers and designers at apple spending as much time being frustrated
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:58.720]  by the things that are difficult on an ipad as i am and you know i think conversely i think boy
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.520]  boy oh boy and one of the reasons that i as a somebody who just loves the mac hopes the mac has
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:09.840]  a bright future for a decade or more to come uh isn't really looking personally to switch to an
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:16.240]  ipad pro uh but boy the reason i really want it is boy are they nice hardware devices yes really
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.800]  really like i i you know for all the complaints we just ran through about pot you know things
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.320]  people like or don't like or prefer don't prefer about um the current macbook lineup
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:34.480]  um and then downright problems boy oh boy is the ipad hardware just amazing the display and and
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:39.600]  the being the first thing to have true tone and the lightweightness and the new speakers
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:46.320]  that are pro motion yeah pro motion and i mean really leading the way in certain hardware uh
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:52.080]  regards above and beyond even the iphone and the mac you know that arguably the best product
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:56.960]  hardware product apple ever has ever made it's really remarkable the a series processor in those
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.960]  makes the corems in i don't know it doesn't call them corems anymore but that's bs that makes the
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.080]  corems cry like you can see them wanting to jump off the tables well do you you know on that point
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:11.840]  on that point have you seen the battery life that these new microsoft machines uh yeah windows
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:20.640]  machines running arm processors are getting like that to me is the uh hey where the hell is you
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:25.600]  know something's got to give here like for all of the just internally looking at apple's products
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.960]  speculation and and even if you only look at apple's products it sure seems as though apple
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:39.440]  ought to be inching closer to releasing macbooks that have a series processors that microsoft
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:45.040]  released these new surface shell ipad or a clamshell ipad one or both you know i don't know
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:51.360]  uh it's it's but the uh the new windows surface machines running the full version of windows not
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:56.720]  like rt was when they first tried to arm are getting like 20 hours of battery life
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:05.360]  like yeah batteries in there and people are you know out in a real world saying yeah i i actually
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.600]  i've been using this for three days non-stop and haven't plugged it in once and i'm still
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:17.840]  still not in the red like 20 hours no joke battery life uh there is no uh there is no mac that gets
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.320]  that ipads don't get it either but that's because of how lightweight they are apple could easily
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:27.280]  make an ipad that weighs as much as an ipad from a few years ago that gets 20 hours of battery life
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.560]  um that will put the battery in the keyboard i mean which is what some of them do
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:40.640]  right uh you know ipad so i would say ipads right now ipads and ipad pros get that amazing battery
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:49.280]  life even if the number is 10 hours instead of 20 it's that's by design uh at this point given ipads
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:57.760]  and now given these arm-based surfaces there is no mac book made that you can say gets good battery
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:05.600]  life it's only good for intel the intel world it's no longer state of the art and i think that's a
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:11.840]  problem no totally agreed and i think like you said i i don't think the solution is going to come
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:18.880]  from intel i think the solution is that they've got to move to arm i think i mean anecdotally
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:25.440]  they've had arm uh mac books or arm clamshells running ios or mac os ported to arm for years
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:30.400]  they just haven't pulled the trigger on them yeah i mean i think everybody after i think after the
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:38.960]  uh the intel transition a decade ago i don't think i don't i don't think anybody is ever
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.760]  gonna not believe that there are versions of everything apple has running on everything
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:49.520]  apple has right maybe there's not a blogger or podcaster can conjecture about it apple has the
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:55.600]  resources and and money certainly to uh i mean certainly clamshell ios device i i can't believe
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:03.920]  they don't have it certainly mac mac os compiling on arm 64 i i can't believe that they don't have
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.880]  i'd be i'd be flabbergasted the only thing i think that was actually public there was a it was an
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:14.720]  intern who did it and then he published the paper on porting at least a part of mac os to to the
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.720]  arm stack the only thing i would question is i don't know do they secretly have a version of
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.160]  ios running on x86 i don't think i don't know that they'd even waste time with it because i'm
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:32.160]  not sure that there's any is there any scenario where they could see that being a thing i don't
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:38.000]  think yeah that would be seeding that'd be going backwards almost from apple's traditional desire
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:46.720]  to control their stack i wonder though i remember when i was at uh uh barebone software and i forget
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:53.840]  which compiler was which but they it was like during you know earlier 2000 2002 and uh
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:03.360]  i think bbi was still being compiled with code warrior but they got it running compiling cleanly
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:10.320]  on gcc and xcode two one thinking it was the right thing to do for the future i could be
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.080]  getting this backwards but there were at least two it was a time when there were multiple compilers
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:19.440]  that professional mac users could choose from and barebones had always kept bb edit running cleanly
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:24.240]  on both because it was just good practice for your source code you know that you don't want to
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:28.320]  get trapped into something like that you know and i think you know that was what the the next
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.680]  crew did coming over you know where next was this portable operating system that ran on uh originally
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:40.400]  it ran on the motorola 68040 and then they got it running on sun's spark or whatever the hell it was
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:45.600]  and then they ported it to x86 and they had this same source thing that could compile across all
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:50.560]  this and then when they needed to port it to power pc when apple bought next it was that you know at
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.560]  least going through the source code and getting it to compile was an issue so maybe they have ios
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:01.520]  compiling on intel just for that but i don't know maybe they have apple x86 so there's amd x86 yeah
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:07.520]  yeah they've experimented with that oh that would be neat uh what else you're in review i i feel
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:12.160]  like we've talked so much about iphone in the last few months that there's it's just a rehash
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:18.160]  of recent episodes but i think that the iphone is in a great place i really do i i think iphone 10
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:27.200]  is a is a rousing success in every regard hardware and software uh i couldn't be happier with it and
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:33.120]  i really think it's it's to me it's the best proof that apple still has it whatever it is even if
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:38.240]  it's not there across the board in every product yeah absolutely i mean it's it's just it's
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.680]  phenomenal hardware really really great software and services integration and it's it's absolutely
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:48.640]  not perfect but it's one of those things that it makes it makes me feel like the future of phones
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:52.400]  it's like when you saw that original iphone or you saw the iphone 4 you go oh yeah i know what
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.320]  the next like the next few years of iphone are going to be and this gives me that this feeling
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.680]  like yes it's the first version of face id and the first version of oled and all these things but i
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:05.840]  i'm excited because this is like a whole new generation of iphone again right and they
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:10.640]  absolutely nailed that from just the point of view of making that next generation product right i i
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.920]  feel like you know it's you know the it's the oldest story in the world that apple's key is
[02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:21.200]  that they do the hardware and the software but i think it's interesting that to me their most
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:25.360]  important hardware on the mac side is the mac books like you said that's just about that's what
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.720]  some people that's the only thing they consider um yeah and so as cool as the imac pro is and
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:35.440]  it's really cool that they've made a really awesome pro computer that's a desktop uh i think
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:41.360]  it's a real problem that the hardware the keyboard and maybe some other things uh or maybe just the
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.760]  fact like you said that there's not a wide enough lineup that there isn't a hey here's more ports
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:54.480]  and a thicker one for pros of a certain need um so you've got the hardware problems on the macbook
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:19:02.480]  you've got the os which is just isn't truly thought through for productivity for the ipad
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.360]  you know so you've got fantastic hardware near perfect hardware for what they're trying to do
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:13.680]  with software that still conceptually falls short and then it you've got the iphone which i think is
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:19.520]  really the epitome of apple where they've got super great hardware and a really good really
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:26.960]  good os yeah absolutely uh ipad pro i mean i think that was a good way to end the year and like you
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.000]  said it's obviously it's you know desktops are for a niche and the ipad pro is for a really good
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.760]  pros for a niche within the niche but boy is it you know apple said you know it was interesting
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.760]  earlier in the year when they had a couple of us out there to say look mac pro we're we've got
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:49.120]  something it'll be a while we're gonna have an imac pro uh we love the pro market we hear you
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:54.800]  we are the pro market here within the company uh and it was great to hear that but you know the
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:20:00.240]  proof is in the pudding what's this saying well you need it it's sort of like like you like some
[02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:04.320]  companies just have to make a hypercar you have to have that lamborghini that ferrari that um
[02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:09.760]  that veyron you know you that bugatti on the top because it's it's aspirational and the imac pro
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:13.680]  it's not going to have the market that the the macbooks have but it doesn't need to it just
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.600]  needs to be sitting there showing that apple can make amazing hardware and making people interested
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.400]  in mac maybe you won't go and buy that but you're like apple makes kick-ass computers and if you
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:26.240]  don't think that you start looking elsewhere so it's important for the overall hay load to have
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.680]  those machines there's a new accurate commercial i've seen over and over and over again during
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:36.240]  football games last few weeks um that literally does that it just starts with an nsx roaring
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.720]  around a racetrack corner and they're talking about the technology that they've put into it
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.920]  and then it you know turns into a honda accord or something like that and then to a honda civic i
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:51.200]  forget i forget if they're all accuracy or if it's a mix but you know somehow making the argument
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:21:00.640]  that the consumer family you know the 23 000 or whatever an accord costs these days i have no idea
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:06.880]  but you know a very typical pop top selling family car benefits from the technology and advances that
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:15.440]  the nsx uh you know super race car uh you know has even if there's no way in hell that a family of
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:21.280]  four is ever going to buy an accurate nsx yeah totally but you get the advantage of lower yields
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.880]  and higher price points so you can experiment more and you can rush you can shake out that
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:29.600]  technology and then it does filter down yeah and i think that the excitement with the ipad or imac
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:34.080]  pro uh you can tell i'm getting punchy from the length of the show that i'm mispronouncing using
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:40.240]  the wrong name for more things uh the excitement of and the frustration before the imac pro
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:48.000]  actually shipped is the not just that there are people like us who want that sort of race car
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.560]  computer from apple and who used to buy them and still need them and want them it's the knowledge
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:22:04.560]  that apple's current stat state their financial wherewithal their custom chip making wherewithal
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.600]  is that if they set their minds to it they could do a better job than ever before right that's the
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:13.760]  first it's not just that you want apple to make a pro computer it's that you know that if they
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:19.760]  really wanted to they could do something that would be mind-blowing like the imac pro which
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:26.560]  has all of this performance and really really struggles to uh work itself into enough of a
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:32.560]  lather to have the fans come on unless you open drag things about box or not drag thing uh pcal
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:39.200]  see there i am there i am making mistakes mixing up mixing up my james thompson yeah yeah yeah
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:45.040]  i'm pretty sure drag things about boxes is not a cpu or gpu stressor i don't even think it's right
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:50.480]  no i don't think he's put a r kid into that yet no but but drag thing will do it anyway he'll have
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:56.160]  that done that's my summary of the year anything else before we we knock this off no i i think
[02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:00.640]  that's spot on and i think it's going to be interesting to see you know again people apple's
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:04.160]  richest company world but they don't have infinite resources there's a limit to the amount of people
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.920]  who are willing to work in cupertino for the amount of money that apple pays rather than the
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:12.240]  allure of startups and they can't focus those people on multiple products every product they
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:16.400]  focus on is a product that they can't focus on at the same time and that's why i think we get
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:20.320]  you know if it's not our favorite product that's getting the attention we get super frustrated
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:24.000]  so it took them a lot to get the imac pro out and it meant we couldn't get a mac mini and we
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:29.280]  couldn't get a mac pro they but hopefully as those machines come out you know they can increase head
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:35.360]  count and they have increased head count but it is yes and money alone and money alone can
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:41.600]  make salaries go higher but money alone can't increase the number of a talent designers
[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:47.200]  engineers people there are in the world right like the apple one of the biggest constraints on apple
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:51.840]  it's always been it's good and it's a constraint on every company but talent is an enormous
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:58.240]  constraint because it's there's only so much of it in the world and apple can't do what we want
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:03.520]  apple to do without a level talent and i think some of these problems because you can't like
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:08.880]  not everyone who's an a-level talent wants to work in cupertino or at apple and also once you scale
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:13.040]  it you get a whole bunch of other like well i think the biggest problem facing apple and i wrote
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:16.480]  about this at the end of the year is scaling that it's hard to take a company that was built the way
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:22.400]  apple was built with small teams that focus on solving specific problems and scale them across
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:28.000]  now four platforms and product lines that include mac and ipad and iphone and apple watch and air
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.560]  pods and everything else that apple is doing and just adding people to that doesn't fix it in some
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:39.840]  ways it makes it worse you know uh one thing i've heard is you know to go circle back an hour to
[02:24:39.840 --> 02:24:48.000]  there to why is airplay too late is that maybe it wasn't exactly the a team that was working on
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:54.400]  airplay too and that's not because apple wouldn't want to put the a team on airplay too but that
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:01.680]  if the entire a team is already working on projects that are deemed essential there's you
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:07.440]  know if the best you've got is the b team to put on airplay too that's that's that's who gets it
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:13.200]  you know yeah yeah and you can't put the a team on everything again like you put them on iphone
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:18.160]  if they're on iphone they can't be working on on imac you know it's it's one of those things
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:27.040]  yeah uh my thanks to our sponsors this week uh squarespace well that's it's do them in order
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:32.400]  let's do let's keep them in order here we got uh we got casper you can buy you can buy an internet
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:39.360]  or buy a mattress on the internet we've got away you can buy a suitcase on the internet now we've
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:46.560]  got squarespace where you can buy an internet on the internet uh renee well thank you everybody
[02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:52.560]  can follow renee on twitter at the uh renee at renee richie uh you can see his fine work at
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:59.760]  imore.com on a daily basis and for your listening pleasure his rejuvenated vector where i've been
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:04.400]  i've been a guest i was a guest a few weeks ago with renee richie so if you missed it if you like
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:09.280]  listening to me and renee talk you can go look up the episode of vector where we were down joined
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:14.560]  by mutual friend daniel jalkett uh and where do you go what's the best place to go to get
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.600]  information on the podcast for the podcast just vector.show and for the column that goes with it
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.640]  i'm more.com vector vector.show that's a pretty good domain name i love these fancy new domain
[02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.920]  names yeah very cool very memorable anyway go check out vector.show i think people are gonna
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:35.520]  like it you're doing it renee's doing it on a daily basis a weekday basis yeah i do it like
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:40.800]  five days a week and i'm probably insane but i'm i'm trying to make it work i think it's interesting
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:45.440]  i thought it was nuts when i heard it but it it's not you know like this it's not two and a half
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:52.720]  hours no at five days a week it is a little bit more like it's tighter it's you know in a way
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:56.880]  that you know there have long been radio and tv shows that are five days a week and they're
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.720]  shorter and more focused uh and i think that's kind of them are super short i think audio version
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:07.840]  of my column for accessibility yeah so i think that's a really interesting thing to do with the
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.680]  podcast form and i think that uh a lot of the podcasts i listen to are in the form of my show
[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:21.680]  or like an atp yeah whether once a week or once a week ish like mine uh but long and i think filling
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:28.800]  the gaps in your what's up next and uh overcast with 10 or 15 minute many things is a really
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:35.760]  really interesting way to to play with the form so i i'm enjoying it oh thank you very much uh
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.400]  i do feel i feel almost feel like for as long as we've been doing podcasts there's been less play
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:47.520]  with the form than we did with the early days of the web you know absolutely so anyway my thanks
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:28:13.680]  to you renee see you next year thank you absolutely you
