[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Glenn Fleischman, it is so good to have you back on the show.
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  It's a pleasure to be back.
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.000]  There is so much going on.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  There's a lot going on.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  A lot going on this week.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  Which is good news, I guess, if you're in the business of talking about stuff that's going on.
[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  It's bad news if you're like me and at a couple of weeks here where it's just been really hard to make time to record a podcast.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  I feel like I'm looking at the show notes I made and I'm like, oh my God, this is like a month's worth of shows.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  It's July. Well, it's August now. There's not supposed to be any news.
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  It hasn't been like that all this summer. It's great, though, really. It really is.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  I remember when it used to be when there was nothing going on in August.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  Yeah, WWDC would happen and then it would just sort of peter out and there would be no news.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  But now we have lawsuits, we have Chinese intervention, we have hackers being arrested on their way out of DEFCON.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  We've got Black Hat or other kinds of stuff happening.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  I forget, but they used to be there. Apple used to have little quiet Mac events in August. Remember those?
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  Were they introducing new Mac models?
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  Yeah, or maybe when they first came out with the iWork suite, they did it in August.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  I never went down for those. I would go down for hardware, but not software in the olden days.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  But I remember going down to Aprils and Septembers, typically.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  Those events, that was before my time of attending events. That was when I did everything remotely in Philadelphia.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  But I don't even know if I would go out. I guess I would go out for it, but they don't really do small events anymore.
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  Not like that.
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  Yeah, there's nothing small because everything they do is a $10 billion or more line of business or starts at that and then goes up.
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  Right. So where do you want to start? What do you think is the one thing?
[01:49.000 --> 01:55.000]  Well, I'm interested, the Chinese market is interesting to me. Should we start with the VPN?
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  We have things to say about that, although it's also a little more, it's a funny situation.
[02:00.000 --> 02:09.000]  So Apple removed some. I thought there was this, neutrally it sounded like, you can't really check the Chinese app store from another country very easily.
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  It sounded like a lot of VPN apps, virtual private network apps that were being removed.
[02:15.000 --> 02:31.000]  And so there's this thing that the background is to that. So China has various kinds of interception and blocking tools to keep people who are either residents or citizens of their country from reaching outside the country for data.
[02:31.000 --> 02:42.000]  And so some things are approved and some are not, but they've really been cracking down on a lot of ability to get outside of China or get out at least at some kind of speed that makes it functional to do things.
[02:42.000 --> 02:51.000]  And Google famously left China in 2010 and set up shop in Hong Kong, even though that's part of China, but it's very confusing little relationship how that works.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  That's an ongoing change. And Apple stayed in, it's gotten bigger and bigger.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  But so the great firewall of China is an effort by the Chinese government to like standard VPNs.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  My understanding is you can't just use, you can't just sign up for like a regular VPN service, forget the app part and just use it inside China.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  So the standard protocols are now being broadly blocked.
[03:14.000 --> 03:26.000]  So you have to use a service that does some other kind of tunneling or uses SSL based or some other system that's not just using the old fashioned stuff like IPSec and over L2TP and all that.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  So that's my understanding. So all these services have thrived because they use different ways and a lot of them are sold worldwide.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  So it's not just they're being sold China, some are China specific and some are worldwide.
[03:36.000 --> 03:48.000]  And so three of them at least have been removed from the app store by Apple because the Chinese government says they lack the appropriate license that allows them to operate in China.
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  And Apple said hundreds of other VPN apps remain available, including those by companies that are outside China.
[03:56.000 --> 04:08.000]  So the VPN companies themselves are kind of, you know, peeved, they made a lot of noise about it, but it's a whole question of like what is compliance to local law?
[04:08.000 --> 04:18.000]  So we don't think that this law require registration of services and compliance with whatever rules China has that might allow blocking and sniffing and other things.
[04:18.000 --> 04:29.000]  This doesn't comport with our feelings and it might, you know, not, I'd argue it's probably in violation of the universal declaration of human rights in terms of freedom of expression and freedom from
[04:29.000 --> 04:45.000]  Well, and let's just stop it right there and admit that whether this particular move is in violation of the declaration of human rights, the People's Republic of China has an awful lot, as official policy, has a lot of policies that are violations of human rights.
[04:45.000 --> 04:57.000]  So fundamentally, this is the thing that frustrates me about that. It is an interesting story. It is absolutely worth noting. It is worth making a stink about.
[04:57.000 --> 05:09.000]  But the knee jerk reaction from a ton of people, even after I tried to painstakingly, and this is just feedback from people who read my site, but painstakingly tried to say, hey, you could be upset about this.
[05:09.000 --> 05:21.000]  You can even object to what Apple's done, but you can't just say Apple should have said no and kept the apps in the App Store because it's like I sort of didn't really use the analogy that great.
[05:21.000 --> 05:30.000]  But I said, you pull that thread like, OK, it's just a little thread which is saying, no, we're not removing any of these apps from the App Store.
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  You can't say Apple should pull that thread without acknowledging that an awful lot of stuff is going to happen after they pull that thread.
[05:36.000 --> 05:50.000]  It isn't something that they can do in isolation and not expect retribution. I mean, my guess is if Apple just said, no, we're keeping these available in the App Store, that the great firewall would start blocking the App Store like entirely.
[05:50.000 --> 05:59.000]  Apple would very likely have to exit the market. I mean, Apple, you know, so there's things in China that are official policy that are promulgated as laws and regulations.
[05:59.000 --> 06:05.000]  So there's things that are informal and the government demand stuff happens behind the scenes that it doesn't conform to any process.
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  So this, to some extent, you could say is like a promulgated law, like there's a regulation, you can look it up.
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  They announced they're going to be doing this big enforcement action.
[06:15.000 --> 06:26.000]  So you have to say, then Apple is saying, we are in opposition to a law regulation in a country in which we're doing business and we are resisting it without using the channels available to us.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  Because we don't know, the Chinese, you know, legal system is very opaque.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  We don't know if they've gone through judicial processes, if they've been working through government agencies.
[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  I assume they have. I mean, there's no reason for Apple to go like, yeah, yeah, we'll just remove whatever they say.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  So I presume they've spent the six or seven months since China said they were going to step up this policy in January.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  I presume they've been lobbying and just saying, look, you know, what can we do?
[06:49.000 --> 06:56.000]  What can we do to make this happen where we're not creating a public relations nightmare for everybody, it doesn't become a deal?
[06:56.000 --> 07:14.000]  And, you know, China, I don't think per se cares, the Chinese leadership cares about that part because it's not something that affects how they govern the country to worry about the response to it, right?
[07:14.000 --> 07:29.000]  The question is, should Apple be in China or not? And honestly, and if they are, if they're going to sell iPhones and Macs in China, this is the sort of thing that they have to do because it's complying with the law.
[07:29.000 --> 07:43.000]  I don't think, for example, that Apple is particularly happy about the Amber Alert thing that your iPhone does when it goes off.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  I don't think they like that sound. I don't think, frankly, I don't think it's a good law.
[07:48.000 --> 07:55.000]  I think it's, you know, I don't think it's, to my knowledge, it's never once helped rescue a child.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  No, I think it did once.
[07:57.000 --> 08:08.000]  I think there was, well, versus the phone, some of the, I believe that some of the alerts that have gone up on like highway signs and through other means, I think that has actually helped track people down.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  But has it helped to have everybody in a certain area have their cell phone make a terrible noise all at once?
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  Right, I mean, everybody in the north, I got one the other day where it said like Meade, Washington, like just yesterday at 84, like Meade is hundreds of miles from here.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  And it's, I totally get the reasoning behind it. It's not regionalized enough, right? That's the problem.
[08:27.000 --> 08:38.000]  Right. So, but does Apple have a choice in the matter? No. The law says in the United States, if you're going to sell a cell phone, it has to, you know, made after a certain date, it has to do this thing.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  I guess I think there's a way to turn it off. I think I'm pretty sure I turned it off on my phone.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  You can disable it. That's right.
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  But, you know, but by law, though, it has to be on by default.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  Right.
[08:49.000 --> 09:04.000]  You know, and again, this is not an issue of human rights. It's not an issue of free speech, but it's just the nature of being a multinational corporation that sells in a bunch of countries is you've got to be compliant with the law in every country you're in.
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  I mean, you know, there's a reason why Apple's legal department is humongous.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  It's not because Apple has just allowed it to grow into a giant bureaucracy just for the hell of it.
[09:16.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's a hell of a thing. And China is a country where complying with the law is going to involve things that deeply offend, in my opinion, correctly so, the sensibilities of people in Western civilized democracies.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  Or democracies anywhere, really.
[09:31.000 --> 09:39.000]  Yeah. And then, of course, and then there's this very easy, the whataboutism response, which you can look up on Wikipedia. It's a great entry for whataboutism.
[09:39.000 --> 09:49.000]  Then you say, well, what about the US? We have all this garbage we do here. We have, you know, warrantless wiretaps, we have extraordinary rendition, we have secret FISA courts, all this stuff.
[09:49.000 --> 10:02.000]  But you say, by and large, things come out. Like, by and large, there's a process and most of the, I would say most of the friction we have about government, let's see, like a continuous thing under any administration.
[10:02.000 --> 10:20.000]  I want to say, like, not most of the friction we have about government, but one of the big issues about privacy is that so much of what should be subject to due process and constitutional protections seems to have been exempted without any review of the constitutionality without a good way to overturn that.
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  So, you have lots of organizations in the United States working on that. But we have a process, we have courts, we have SCOTUS, we have a thing that we agree is a mechanism.
[10:27.000 --> 10:43.000]  So, even when we veer towards something that is anti-constitutional, there should be a way to veer back. And it may take sometimes years or decades for that to happen, but we tend to hew towards upholding constitutional rights, which include upholding, you know, which broadly upholds human rights.
[10:43.000 --> 11:03.000]  And we'd argue maybe that, so what aboutism is like, well, okay, we're criticizing China for this, but America has all these issues. You know, we have all these things we've done. We've got people in Guantanamo, we've got, you know, trillions of bytes of data being collected every month by people on black budgets who are contractors to the government, sorting through, you know, blah, blah, all this stuff's going on.
[11:03.000 --> 11:17.000]  But I would say we are still fundamentally, we are a democracy with a rule of law, with a justice system that's judiciary, that's independent, and has review, and we're wrestling with some of those fine points. So, when Apple opposed the FBI in the San Bernardino case, Apple had a process.
[11:17.000 --> 11:34.000]  It was not ordered to do something, people didn't come in with guns the middle of the night and, you know, point them at Tim Cook and make him march out and find engineers. They went through a process, most of it was public, and the FBI eventually bought tools from hackers to break into the phone and found apparently nothing useful.
[11:34.000 --> 11:52.000]  So, we'd argue, I guess, that in China, it's, you know, partly they have, don't have the same orientation towards the primacy of human rights and individual expression that many other countries do and that we believe is kind of the foundation of, you know, I believe, I don't agree with China's approach to human rights and freedom of expression.
[11:52.000 --> 12:08.000]  I'm not sure it's a valid, I can't even say I think the approach is a valid one in terms of how it crushes the human spirit, right? But I can also understand if I step back and say objectively, they have a different orientation to that and they are a sovereign nation, they've established their sovereignty.
[12:08.000 --> 12:19.000]  And if Apple wants to work in that market, they have to work within the constraints of a system that is not organized in a way to provide this kind of a judicial access and appeals process and transparency to what they do.
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  Yeah, I totally agree. I think the thing that we do as the United States that's most objectionable on our front are those, the secret orders. I think you mentioned it, right? The ones where the company-
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Oh, the FISA court things, right? Or there's also-
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  Legally not-
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  No, there's more, too.
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  Legally not allowed to notify the person that it's been issued, which is bullshit. That's to me a violation.
[12:40.000 --> 12:55.000]  That is a different thing. Those aren't FISA court, it's a, that's a different thing where the government, right, can issue a, right, and that's where you have the canary documents on the site, right? Where you can say Apple, I forget which site everybody has it, but you have a document that says the government hasn't asked us for this yet.
[12:55.000 --> 13:09.000]  And if that document were to disappear, that's legal. And it means the government has asked them for something, right? That's a great little mechanism to get around that limitation of- because right, there's an argument is that it's probably not constitutional if it were firmly tested.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  I don't believe SCOTUS has taken up that particular issue.
[13:15.000 --> 13:31.000]  No, I don't think so. So I really do. I just, it frustrates me that people don't, really don't think this through. And I really do think- so somebody, and then some people I've seen, some people arguing that Apple should just pull out of China.
[13:31.000 --> 13:51.000]  They should not, they just should not sell products in a country with policies like this. And I think, I think there is a line that, and I don't even, I think there are lines that China could feasibly, it might actually happen where China would make a demand that would prompt Apple to actually pull out of China and sacrifice all the money.
[13:51.000 --> 14:06.000]  I think, for example, if China mandated that there has to be a backdoor to get into the- like a San Bernardino backdoor, some kind of golden key so that a confiscated phone in the People's Republic of China, that the government could decrypt it.
[14:06.000 --> 14:18.000]  And any phone sold in the country must have, you know, such a mechanism. I don't believe Apple would make a separate SKU for iPhones to comply with that. I really don't.
[14:18.000 --> 14:33.000]  I don't think so either. I think it's so, and I think, so there's this issue of would China push Apple to a point where it knows that Apple would exit and that might actually occur because China, I mean, I forgot if you had Ben Thompson on to talk about this or you were talking about it.
[14:33.000 --> 14:48.000]  He wrote that great thing several months ago about the key, and I've seen it repeated a number of times since, and I don't know if his insight was original, but it's been, so I'll claim it was, that in China, the app has primacy, not the ecosystem, right?
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  So, you have WeChat and Alipay and other kinds of things that are app-based and they work the same across every platform that's available.
[14:57.000 --> 15:06.000]  So, you can buy a cheap Linux phone that's not Android even. You can buy an Android phone, whatever, an iPhone, and you're using the apps, and the apps are the thing that are primacy.
[15:06.000 --> 15:25.000]  So, this explains just not as much, even though there was originally very clearly this brand awareness and brand desire for iPhones. In China, it sounds like that's faded somewhat, and we can see that in sales and so forth, and that people have now kind of very rapidly switched over to just thinking about the efficacy of the individual apps.
[15:25.000 --> 15:34.000]  So, Apple has less of a, I don't know, like when they were selling more devices and were a more critical part of that market, they might have had more leverage.
[15:34.000 --> 15:44.000]  I think this boils down to, you know, would China care if Apple left the market? Would it harm China as a country? Probably not that much, because they have all the alternatives they need.
[15:44.000 --> 15:56.000]  It wouldn't be harming their competitiveness or whatever. It does, of course, then you get into this whole, okay, well, you know, Apple not only does it make like maybe $10 billion in the most recent quarter in revenue in China, which was down year over year,
[15:56.000 --> 16:05.000]  but they have all this manufacturing operation that they contract, Foxconn and everybody else, some billions and billions. I don't know what the scale is that's dedicated to Apple.
[16:05.000 --> 16:22.000]  What happens to that? If Apple refuses to obey, does suddenly all those production lines get shut down and they're incapable of making iPhones? I really don't know what would happen there, but the Chinese government is supreme and centralized, and it can do whatever it wants at some level.
[16:22.000 --> 16:36.000]  Apple's relation with China is unique, and the only other country where they have a relationship as unique would be the United States since their headquarters is here and most of their employees live here.
[16:36.000 --> 16:47.000]  I would argue that Apple's relationship with the United States, though, it's almost not a relationship because it's like this is where the roots of the company are.
[16:47.000 --> 16:57.000]  It's intertwined. Their American identity is almost, you don't even think of them as having a relationship with the United States because they're here and that's where their headquarters is.
[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  But their relationship with China is inordinately complex, and China is not just the second biggest market.
[17:04.000 --> 17:20.000]  And the people who want to be cynical about it and say that Apple is kowtowing just because of the money.
[17:20.000 --> 17:37.000]  And that would be true if, let's say, they did all of their manufacturing in Japan. Taiwan's not a good example because it's sort of tied to China, but let's just say that they didn't have any actual manufacturing and assembly footprint in mainland China.
[17:37.000 --> 17:53.000]  That still would be a tremendous, just the size of the market makes it important. But because that's actually not true, they do have a massive manufacturing and assembly footprint in China, and so many of their suppliers also are there.
[17:53.000 --> 18:12.000]  I mean, part of the whole success of Foxconn in China is the proximity. It's not just Apple and Foxconn. It's the proximity to the companies that drive the trucks in every day with pallets full of one tiny little thing for the camera.
[18:12.000 --> 18:34.000]  It's the proximity to it that would make it so hard for Apple to move manufacturing somewhere else. And let's face it, Apple's relationship with China on any of these matters is way more complicated than it would be if they were simply selling products to the people of the country.
[18:34.000 --> 19:02.000]  Yeah, I totally agree with all that. And I thought Tim Cook expressed the frustration pretty frankly. I was sort of surprised in the analyst call a few days ago where he has to be very careful what he says, but it wasn't, what I want to say, it was balanced, but I thought it was also sort of frank about the fact that they want to engage with what's going on.
[19:02.000 --> 19:12.000]  And if they can't, you know, as we said, they can't just say, no, that's not going to, you know, that's not going to cut anything for them just to say no.
[19:12.000 --> 19:24.000]  But because they don't have the basis under the law or in process to do that. And, you know, I was saying, you know, Apple, I actually feel like Apple should take a stronger stance even if it's not saying no.
[19:24.000 --> 19:42.000]  I feel like they should be making more effort. And I think Tim's comments went more towards that because one of my concerns is that by agreeing to Chinese restrictions, regardless of how legal they are under Chinese law, even in self-consistent, it empowers more countries to ask for more.
[19:42.000 --> 20:10.000]  And the U.S. and U.K. in particular are asking for it. So, with that in mind, I feel like there's a danger that this, and this is kind of this ongoing thing, the bigger power China gets, the more it was seemingly going to have to liberalize because it was facing the reality of more citizens with more money, a higher standard of living, and a middle class demands more and different, and it's more comfortable, and thus it's not as malleable, and there's more power that's distributed when money is distributed that way.
[20:10.000 --> 20:31.000]  So, the Chinese government, I think, I mean, I'm not a Chinese scholar. I don't know how long the current structure can stand. It seems very fragile to me, and there's all this money and pressure and what have you, but as it's grown as a power, as an economic and market and world power, people are learning the wrong lessons from it.
[20:31.000 --> 20:43.000]  So, democracies have adopted more restrictive policies. I mean, you see Russia, which has always had kind of totalitarian, centralized, whatever, like when has Russia actually been free? Maybe sort of under Yeltsin, but I don't know.
[20:43.000 --> 20:59.000]  But it's frustrating to see that the wrong lessons are being learned. They're being imported into democracies, that democracies learn how they can repress their own citizens better because they're seeing it demonstrated with no repercussion in countries that are not democratic.
[20:59.000 --> 21:20.000]  I think that, so somebody on Twitter, and it seems like he deleted the tweet. I don't know if he's somebody who deletes his, you know, it was like a conversation, a public conversation we had, but I'm not going to, I still have it here to read, but I won't say his name, but just because I'm worried that he deleted it for a reason.
[21:20.000 --> 21:36.000]  But anyway, it was somebody who objected to, accused me of defending Apple, just blindly in the face, you know, simply as, and I said, well, seriously, what would you have them do differently? Do you really, you know, do you really want them to pull out of China?
[21:36.000 --> 21:51.000]  And let's face it, when we talk about this, pulling out of China is not just a decision to forgo about 25% of their current revenue. It quite possibly would, it could, I mean, cost Tim Cook his job.
[21:51.000 --> 22:08.000]  I mean, because it's quite possible that a majority of Apple's shareholders would look at this and say, this is not worth pulling out of 25% of our revenue for the foreseeable future and jeopardizing our relationship with this country.
[22:08.000 --> 22:18.000]  Apple actually makes a ton of profit, but you know, so it doesn't, it's not making all its profit in China, but voluntarily giving up all that revenue and all that profit.
[22:18.000 --> 22:33.000]  And, you know, so this person was reasonable though, it was a good, it was a very, it was an adult argument, you know, argument gets a bad rap as a word because everybody becomes so overly sensitive that we think argument is a fight.
[22:33.000 --> 22:42.000]  But no, it's a logical argument. But his thing was that Tim Cook should personally state his opposition on Twitter as he has to many other political issues in the US.
[22:42.000 --> 22:54.000]  You know, like he has, for example, Tim Cook has publicly come out in opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies.
[22:54.000 --> 23:06.000]  I don't think, that's a reasonable opinion to say that Tim Cook should do that. That wouldn't cost Tim Cook his job. He could do that. I'll bet he's thought about it. I wouldn't be surprised if he does at some point.
[23:06.000 --> 23:20.000]  But you also, and again, I'm not a Chinese expert in any way, neither are you, but I do know enough about China that politically, you must be extraordinarily delicate.
[23:20.000 --> 23:35.000]  It is a culture and a government that, on both sides, both in what they say and what they expect to hear, they value subtlety.
[23:35.000 --> 23:46.000]  Well, I'll tell you something. I talked to a Chinese expert, a fellow whose name is Rajer Krimers, who's Dutch. He's an expert in Chinese law and governance and has studied this kind of thing.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  I said, you know, what could Apple do? And he has some, you know, what kind of response could they have other than what they did?
[23:52.000 --> 24:02.000]  And he said, you know, we talked about this earlier here, but he said, this is Chinese law. And they could become part, there's a board, the TC260 is the committee that oversees this.
[24:02.000 --> 24:13.000]  Microsoft and Cisco are members of this board. Apple is not. They could. He thinks that actually, I think his stance is very interesting for someone who is from a Western democracy.
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  Like I say, I believe he's from the Netherlands. He's taught and researched the Netherlands and in England and Oxford.
[24:20.000 --> 24:32.000]  And he thinks that actually this sort of unfettered ability of expression on the internet may actually not be in the best interest of citizens, not just a governmental thing, which is an interesting stance.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  You know, the reason we limit rights by, this is what he says, the reason we limit rights by law is that their unfettered exercise might cause undue harm, limiting the liberty of others.
[24:41.000 --> 24:49.000]  It's long overdue this notion is introduced to the online sphere. Acts that are unlawful in real law should not be condoned just because one happens to commit them in cyberspace.
[24:49.000 --> 24:55.000]  And after having seen, so that's distinct from free speech, right? People would read that. And originally I thought, well, that seems awfully harsh.
[24:55.000 --> 25:17.000]  And then I thought, aren't I one of the people who would like to see consequences happen when people commit, you know, basically crimes in Twitter or have some consequential mechanism for things that are not simply about the ability to state an opinion and exercise free speech, but have a real world consequence, like doxing, things that are in fact illegal under some state and federal laws.
[25:17.000 --> 25:28.000]  But he says this, which is, I think, interesting. He says, the Chinese starting point is that historical political mission needs to be fulfilled, which requires the mobilization of the entire society and therefore the imposition of discipline.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  This requires the state not to be limited and controlled in its power, but to have the ability to quickly and decisively intervene to clear roadblocks.
[25:35.000 --> 25:47.000]  That is anathema to the U.S. and to most democracies. But, you know, it's good to get insight from someone who studied this so deeply, who says this is, you know, their guiding philosophy is that that is the most important factor.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  We have, in our country, we want to be able to carry our guns and our liquor and drive 100 miles an hour.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  All at the same time.
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  All at the same time. We want the drive-through liquor store and whatever.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  With a gun on the passenger seat.
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  Right, right. You've got broken glass in the back seat with your child sitting in it, no seat belt, and that's what you want.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  So, I mean, I'm making a caricature. But it's true is that we favor individual expression, individual rights.
[26:14.000 --> 26:14.000]  We do.
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  There's a primacy of it that's encoded in the central tenet of our government.
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  And there's various, I mean, look, we have a lot of disagreements about what those limits are.
[26:23.000 --> 26:35.000]  But what Roger's talking about is really that is like, some parts of the political spectrum want to impose more rules in some ways on people's bodies or property, and others want less.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  And it surprises me sometimes which end of the political spectrum wants government to impose rules on others in those fashions.
[26:42.000 --> 26:56.000]  With China, it's just a much more monolithic, the society becomes paramount, and this ability for us to control things and mobilize all the forces at once and move us forward in a single central direction is the most important thing.
[26:56.000 --> 27:11.000]  I really do think, and I have yet to be proven wrong, and I know that there are some people who simply say Apple is a for-profit corporation, and because they're so insanely profitable, literally the most profitable country in the world for the last few years.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  I mean, that won't last.
[27:14.000 --> 27:25.000]  There's zero doubt in my mind that that won't last, because it never lasts, that's the sort of thing, but they should remain very profitable for a very long time.
[27:25.000 --> 27:36.000]  And that inherently any for-profit corporation is full of shit, and nothing they say can be believed, and usually you should default to assuming that they're lying in anything they say.
[27:36.000 --> 27:49.000]  Okay, but in my experience as a very close watcher of this particular company and somebody who has a personal relationship with their PR department, I've never been lied to by anybody at Apple.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  Not off the record, never, not once have I been told something that turned out not to be true.
[27:57.000 --> 28:14.000]  They often give no answer, they often refuse to answer, every once in a while they give a circuitous answer, but not one that is like Bill Clinton style, depends what the meaning of the word is, or something like that.
[28:14.000 --> 28:27.000]  And I say this as a huge Bill Clinton fan, I'm just saying, I found them to be, I think that they are a tremendously honest company, and again, they don't necessarily say, they'll give a lot of non-answers.
[28:27.000 --> 28:46.000]  And I think Tim Cook's public statements, if anything, if there was anybody in the company who said things that weren't true, it was Steve Jobs. And that he wasn't really a liar, but that he would, you know, the reality distortion thing.
[28:46.000 --> 28:57.000]  So I would say in the post-Jobs era, the company has been, one difference between the Steve Jobs era and the post-Steve era is that the company has become completely honest, in my opinion.
[28:57.000 --> 29:17.000]  And I think Cook's remarks on the call were honestly what he meant, and I think you're right that they were very carefully considered, so that he could state his opposition in terms that were politically digestible to the Chinese ears.
[29:17.000 --> 29:28.000]  But I think his overall argument of, we think it's better to be engaged than not engaged, was true. And that's also what he said about his involvement with the Trump administration.
[29:28.000 --> 29:42.000]  That it's better to be involved, and if I can get his ear and make my case for why he's wrong on these things, we have a better chance of affecting it by being engaged than not engaged.
[29:42.000 --> 29:52.000]  Do I think he enjoys putting a suit on and sitting there next to Trump? And he's always conspicuously right next to Trump because he's, you know, he's the CEO.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  The richest one.
[29:53.000 --> 30:01.000]  Right, he's the, you know, maybe not the person, personally not the richest, but he certainly is the one of the company that's the richest. Do I think he enjoys it?
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.000]  I thought about that right.
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  Do I think so?
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  They probably rank it by company size, right? If you're half trillion dollars, you're over there. If you're three quarters trillion dollars, you're there.
[30:08.000 --> 30:14.000]  I don't think the other administrations would do that. I think Trump, though, certainly would, you know.
[30:14.000 --> 30:33.000]  No, I agree. I mean, I think it's a direct relationship, too, is, you know, there was an argument, is that Apple, especially with its progressive policies, with a gay CEO, with its history and interest in immigration, with its employees all over the world, including in affected countries that were affected by the travel ban,
[30:33.000 --> 30:42.000]  that they should completely, you know, create a kind of Cold War situation with the Trump administration and just support and battle elsewhere.
[30:42.000 --> 30:54.000]  And I, you know, as much as I would prefer Trump to be frozen out, on the other hand, it doesn't do any good for the U.S. economy, doesn't do any good for Apple, for its employees, its shareholders, you know, Apple's customers.
[30:54.000 --> 31:04.000]  It just, it makes things worse, as unpleasant as it might be, to see what feels like, you know, co-opt, being co-opted or being used.
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  Like Trump's comment, you know, oh, there'll be three big, beautiful plants. This makes things up, as we know. Three big, beautiful plants.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  It turns out that was total bullshit. I thought it was.
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  Like the Fox, the Fox, can we talk about, can we, I want to segue slightly, if that's all right.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  Let's hold this. Let's hold this thought.
[31:18.000 --> 31:18.000]  OK.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  Remember that we're going to come back to this. I just wanted to say this.
[31:20.000 --> 31:21.000]  I'm going to pause on Fox.
[31:21.000 --> 31:34.000]  I want to say this. I want to say this about the China thing is that to me, the thing that I think that the zealots who want Apple to stand up and shout a no, no, no about this, that they are overlooking is the welfare of the people of China.
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  Isn't that the most important thing?
[31:36.000 --> 31:44.000]  It's not the abstract notion of are you, you know, are you hindering free speech?
[31:44.000 --> 31:53.000]  Second, that the notion of why free speech is important is fundamentally about are the people, it's the welfare and the freedoms of the people that matter.
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  Right.
[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  And are the people of China better off or worse off if Apple completely pulls out of China?
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  I would say they're worse off. It's better.
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  I think that's the issue.
[32:01.000 --> 32:07.000]  They're so big. It'd be one thing if we were a smaller company. They're so big and they're so intertwined with the Chinese company.
[32:07.000 --> 32:14.000]  They have sales, they have customers, they have employees, they have stores, they have manufacturing partners.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.000]  Regardless what people think about Chinese outsourcing manufacturer, the phone iPhones would not be made if it were not for China.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  China would not be affordable.
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.000]  China is cracking down on end to end encrypted messaging systems.
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.000]  They just stopped.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.000]  Right.
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.000]  They pulled the plug. Well, not pulled the plug, but they set up the great firewall to block WhatsApp like two weeks ago.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  Right.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  But iMessage and FaceTime are still working.
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  Right.
[32:38.000 --> 32:45.000]  And iMessage and FaceTime, and I know that there are cynics out there who think, oh, Apple probably gave China the back door or something like that.
[32:45.000 --> 32:50.000]  They really are engineered. I can't prove this. I'm not an encryption expert. I don't have the source code.
[32:50.000 --> 32:59.000]  But everything I know about them is that they were drawn from the ground up so that there could not be a man in the middle back door just for China or something like that.
[32:59.000 --> 33:15.000]  There is a way to do it, but we require changes that I think if we discovered that Tim Cook had authorized or anyone in the company had authorized those kind of changes, and they'd been rolled out, it's possibly he'd be committing a crime under U.S. law.
[33:15.000 --> 33:16.000]  Right.
[33:16.000 --> 33:20.000]  So, I don't think he could do it. It could be fraud.
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.000]  I mean, their marketing materials, everything they say says they don't do it, so they would be committing certain kinds of consumer and criminal fraud potentially if they change that.
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  Right.
[33:28.000 --> 33:35.000]  The hit to their credibility would be worth more money financially than the Chinese market. It would absolutely devastate the company. It would crater the company.
[33:35.000 --> 33:43.000]  And again, is it possible that they might start blocking iMessage, and is that the line where they would pull out of China? No, probably not.
[33:43.000 --> 33:56.000]  I'm just saying I cited iMessage and FaceTime as end-to-end encrypted things that completely work in China, not as that's the only reason why Apple should stay in China, but just one example of why I think it should.
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  Mm-hmm.
[33:57.000 --> 34:04.000]  And that the main thing is to think about, you know, is it good or better or worse for the Chinese people? Anyway, that was my thing.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  What do you want to talk about? You had a Foxconn idea?
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  Well, I just want to, this is a little bit of a segue, but it's kind of very similar.
[34:10.000 --> 34:19.000]  So, you know, Foxconn, so Trump had that big announcement with Scott Walker in Wisconsin that, hey, I've brokered this deal and Foxconn's coming, even though the deal has been in progress since 2014.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  Right.
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  And Foxconn's been talking about it.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  Foxconn's enabling the presidency by allowing these kinds of messages to be said, and, you know, so that's a deal.
[34:27.000 --> 34:45.000]  But so here's the thing that cracks me up, is this is the kind of good deal we're getting, is that, of course, states, unfortunately, work, they're actually all competing against each other to lure businesses, and it winds up Boeing got billions of dollars from my state, Washington state, and then immediately, almost immediately started laying people off and restructuring its operations.
[34:45.000 --> 34:57.000]  And there's a lot of anger here about Boeing because of that, because they got, I think, the largest single tax incentive plan, and it was not structured to only be in effect if based on the employment issues.
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  So, you know, they're able to locate new production lines elsewhere.
[35:00.000 --> 35:14.000]  So, so Wisconsin is very happy to offer $3 billion in state tax breaks to, which winds up being $230,000 per worker, assuming the factory employs 13,000 jobs.
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  So this is a 15-year deal, and in 15 years, 13,000 jobs probably won't generate tax revenue that even approaches that much.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  I mean, there's an issue about the tax, there'll be revenue booked from the plant that they'll get tax from.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  There's other things, although because of this, we don't know what the final thing would be.
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.000]  But I'm just like, this is the kind of big, beautiful deal that's being made, is just giving all this money away.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  The state's giving away so much that it's going to wind up maybe never making, you know, more money.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  I really, while we're on it, I just have to say that this thing where Trump, was it an interview with the Washington Post? I forget who it was with.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  Oh, was that the New York, which one is this?
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  I don't know, the one where he said that, you know, I talked to, Tim Cook called me up.
[35:55.000 --> 36:03.000]  He said, Don, we're going to build three big, beautiful plants right here in the U.S.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Yeah, Wall Street Journal.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  Wall Street Journal.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  Yeah, that was that interview where they didn't release the transcript originally, and then it got released later.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  It got leaked, and eternity said all kinds of crazy things.
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  This part was reported.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  Apple did not respond.
[36:15.000 --> 36:24.000]  I wasn't sure if that was something to do with, you know, that they were only a week away from the earnings call or whatever, but it was obviously asked on the earnings call.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  And Tim Cook gave another very politically.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  That was a very good answer.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Well considered.
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  But the translation is, we have no idea what the fuck he's talking about.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Right.
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  We have no plans.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  I think the Foxconn, like, it's just, he doesn't, nobody,
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  I guess that's the kernel.
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  I guess that, you know, because he did, he, he did make political hay out of this Foxconn plant in, in not Minnesota.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  It's Wisconsin.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  Yeah, speaking of Ben, Ben Thompson, Wisconsin.
[36:54.000 --> 37:03.000]  And I guess somehow that rattled around in that big, emptied skull of his, and somehow Foxconn makes Apple stuff.
[37:03.000 --> 37:12.000]  And so a Foxconn plant for flat panel TVs in Wisconsin turned into three huge factories for iPhones.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  It's great.
[37:13.000 --> 37:22.000]  It literally is the case that Apple hasn't even, the flat panels that they're making at this Foxconn plant aren't even part of anything that Apple would use.
[37:22.000 --> 37:30.000]  So they're not even, you know, it could obviously change and, you know, perhaps, you know, they could start making different types of flat panels there.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  And Apple obviously makes an awful lot of devices that use displays.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  So in theory, it's possible that that displays made in that facility might end up in Apple products someday,
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  but it's certainly not an Apple plant in any way, shape or form.
[37:42.000 --> 37:49.000]  But, you know, the thing I was more excited about is that Cook said they're going to invest all this money in U.S. manufacture, which is great.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  I think the big story, so here's the big story I think of the next 10 years is, so you know,
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  a lot of the thing in China that makes it possible to manufacture goods there very affordably is not just the labor costs,
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  which have been going up steadily.
[38:00.000 --> 38:08.000]  Labor is a tiny, tiny percentage of, at one point, I think it was 1% of the retail price of the iPhone was actual labor to assemble it.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  And a lot of times you have chips coming from all over the world.
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.000]  You've got components coming from a bunch of places, but the main stuff is all being made and integrated in China.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  And it's the locked in value of having all of these different industries that work together,
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  making components all in these, you know, sometimes one city or one area that form these close relationships.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  That's the lock in advantage they have, but labor is becoming less and less of so,
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  especially as robotic assembly is going to become, you know, even more so than today.
[38:36.000 --> 38:41.000]  But so what I'm interested about is this, the trend of the next 10 years is how much stuff gets made domestically,
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  whether it's domestically in the U.S. or China for Chinese products for Chinese people,
[38:45.000 --> 38:52.000]  which is a big push China has as well is trying to make high tech products and other things that are made in other countries,
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  which still exists in large quantities.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  Remember, the U.S. is still the number one or everywhere around the number two manufacturing economy in the world,
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  despite the fact that we've decreased employment in that industry because we're so efficient.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  So, there's this big trend.
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.000]  Stuff's going to come back here because everything's gotten more, it gets more expensive to move things around.
[39:10.000 --> 39:19.000]  It gets more expensive to the, like I was just reading a great article the other day about companies that are switching to software development in like,
[39:19.000 --> 39:26.000]  you know, companies are hiring in Indiana and smaller states and mid-sized cities, not rural yet or small towns,
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  but they're hiring in these places where they have plenty of qualified people, people willing to be trained.
[39:31.000 --> 39:38.000]  They pay them a great salary for the area, but it's a fraction of the salary in Silicon Valley or New York or Seattle.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  They're in the same time zones or within one time zone that companies are dealing with.
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  They're native English speakers.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  And as much as I want to, I mean, I am not making any bias against people who learn English as a second or third or fourth language,
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  because many people communicate perfectly well in those.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  But when you add all the things up, it's like they're finding, and wages in India have now gone up as well as China.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  So, this article noted that I think wages are now going to cost half as much on an hourly basis for a programmer in India,
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  but all the things added up make it harder to turn stuff as fast.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  It puts in enough friction that these companies are now delighted to have people they can call and work with in real time,
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  who are in the culture and in the regulatory environment, and it's all kind of in the same place.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  So, I think that is exciting to see Apple invest into more of the U.S. manufacturing economy,
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.000]  because stuff is coming back and more of it will as the cost and quality of life improves in developing countries.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  That's well said. All right, I'm going to take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  Long time sponsor of the show, but they're back and they have a new product, so don't just stay tuned even if you've heard of it.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  It's Eero. Eero makes Wi-Fi mesh network equipment for your home.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  They have a new second generation product just came out. I really think it might have been even last month.
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.000]  It's brand new. Second generation base station. Looks exactly like the first one, almost.
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  You actually have to turn it upside down and look at the model number to really tell the difference.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  And they sort of did a little slightly different treatment of the Eero logo on the thing.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  But it's the same size, same shape. And it can integrate, right?
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  If you already have Eero, you can buy the new stuff. You can buy the new base stations and they hook right into the network.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  But the new one, they've added a new thing. It's called the Eero Beacon, and it's about half the size.
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  The Eero's are really, really small, the base stations. But now they have a beacon.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  And in the original setup, the first gen Eero setup, all of the stations were the same.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  You'd get these little Apple TV style things. One of them is your main one.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  You hook it up to your ethernet for your cable, wherever your internet comes into the house.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  And then the other ones you put around the house.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  Well, now they've got this thing and they were the same. You just pick one to be the main one.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Hook it up to the internet and you didn't have to do it.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  Well, now they have these ones called beacons, and the beacons are half the size. They're smaller.
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  They don't even have a power cord. What you do is you just plug it right into the wall.
[41:54.000 --> 42:03.000]  And it's just a little device that plugs in the wall like a nightlight, except it actually has a nightlight feature, which is awesome.
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  It's really, really clever. And if you don't want that, you can turn it off.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  And it's smart and it knows it has ambient light sensor, so it only comes on when you want it to.
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.000]  But this second generation thing with the beacon adds a third 5 gigahertz radio.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  And so the second generation hero is now tri band and it makes it twice as fast as its predecessor.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  And I had the first gen set up in my house and it's the fastest Wi-Fi I've ever had in the house.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  And it's we have a four four four story house.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  It gets really good Internet up in the fourth floor, which never would have with a base station that's on the first floor.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  So it's never could have happened with with like a traditional try to blanket your house from one base station Wi-Fi system just wouldn't work.
[42:48.000 --> 42:59.000]  If you don't know, you know, the basic idea is that they set up a mesh network where you it's like the type of network that like a big office would have at great expense with the professional setup.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  And instead you do it. You don't have to be an expert at all.
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.000]  You just use the excellent, excellent hero app right on your phone and it tells you, walks you right through how to set it up.
[43:10.000 --> 43:15.000]  It gives you advice on where to position them related to stairs and stuff like that.
[43:15.000 --> 43:25.000]  The beacon makes it even easier to just blanket your whole house with really, really strong Wi-Fi signal.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  It's a great product. I really, really love the company. And the second generation one is just better in every way.
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  It's literally faster. The beacons really, really make it better.
[43:35.000 --> 43:41.000]  And last but not least, Eero has incredible customer support and it's something that the company has really invested a lot in.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  They wanted to emphasize that I mentioned it here on the ad read.
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  They'll get you hook you up, you call them up and they'll put you in touch with a Wi-Fi expert within 30 seconds.
[43:51.000 --> 44:01.000]  I didn't need it. I don't think you would either. But just in case you have a weird thing or you run into something, you can get somebody on the phone in 30 seconds and they know what they're talking about.
[44:01.000 --> 44:13.000]  Really, really, this is just a great product. So go there, figure it out. And you go to the Eero dot com and buy enough equipment based on the size of your apartment or home or whatever you're trying to set it up.
[44:13.000 --> 44:22.000]  And remember this code, the talk show, the talk show. And you use that code when you buy your Eero kit and you will get free overnight shipping.
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.000]  So literally, you could just pause this podcast right now and go order up your Eero.
[44:26.000 --> 44:34.000]  If you were thinking, if you've been thinking for a while about getting a new Wi-Fi set up and you've just been putting it off, well, now's the time to do it because the Eero version two is out.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  So go get it. Pause the podcast. Come back when you're done and it'll show up at your house tomorrow for free.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  So my thanks to Eero. Great product. Back to the show.
[44:46.000 --> 45:03.000]  I don't want to provide any, what's the word, endorsement of products I haven't used, but I have not used Eero yet. But oh, my God, is everybody talking about it? So I've got to try this. As a long time Wi-Fi guy, I have a ridiculously working network now with like TP-Link and Apple routers and CRUD and lots of wires.
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  Eero is my future for testing.
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.000]  For those who don't remember, Glenn used to write a Wi-Fi blog, right?
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  Every day.
[45:12.000 --> 45:20.000]  The early days of Wi-Fi, there was so much news that you actually could and did legitimately have a daily updated Wi-Fi blog.
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  I've been tempted to reboot it. I shut it down in 2011. The archives still get a lot of traffic, which is hilarious.
[45:25.000 --> 45:36.000]  One of the most popular articles in that story is a link, not an article, but a link to David Pogue's review in like 2007 of some Wi-Fi connected speakers because the Internet's a weird place, man.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  But I've been tempted to reboot it just to write about mesh because there's so much. I just wrote like an overview.
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  What was the name of the blog?
[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  Oh, for Macworld?
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  No, what was the name of the blog?
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.000]  Oh, Wi-Fi networking news, so it's Wi-Fi.netnews.com. Still there, still there. The main article is, hey, I shut this thing down.
[45:50.000 --> 45:56.000]  But I just wrote a mesh explainer for TechHive, a part of a Macworld sister site.
[45:56.000 --> 46:03.000]  And part of it was just kind of like, you know, so what, like, why do you want to, like, what's the point of this?
[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  And really, there's like seven or eight systems out there. Some are from startups, some are from third or existing companies.
[46:09.000 --> 46:16.000]  And the deal is people are just sick, sick to death of dead areas and configuring things.
[46:16.000 --> 46:25.000]  And, you know, I wrote for Harry McCracken, the first article I wrote for PCWorld, I want to say it was 10, 12 years ago when Harry was the editor-in-chief.
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.000]  They had gotten this thing back from the survey. They used to do customer surveys at PCWorld. It was great.
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  They'd go out to read those surveys and get huge amounts of information.
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  And they had found the return rate on Wi-Fi equipment was like 30% to retail.
[46:37.000 --> 46:44.000]  And I would not be surprised if for conventional Wi-Fi stuff, like just the base station router stuff that you get,
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  not the mesh things, if the rate wasn't still 30%, just based on people's frustration with setting it up.
[46:50.000 --> 46:57.000]  I just can't say enough good things about the way that Eero works. I know that AdRead is officially over, but I don't care.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  It's a part of the show.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  I never find the thing. Everybody's talking about it.
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  You know how you get like, I had to do it with the stupid cable modem I got from Comcast when I moved,
[47:08.000 --> 47:14.000]  where you end up going to a web page in there, like go to this web page and you configure things there.
[47:14.000 --> 47:15.000]  Yeah.
[47:15.000 --> 47:23.000]  It always feels janky configuring something from a web app or a web forum and you're typing in IP numbers and you're seeing IP numbers and stuff like that.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.000]  Setting up an Eero is nothing like that.
[47:24.000 --> 47:33.000]  It's one of those things, too, where you do it on your phone, not on your computer, and it feels right that you're doing it on your phone.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  It actually, because the experience is so just tap this, tap that, you know, okay this.
[47:38.000 --> 47:47.000]  That doing it on the phone doesn't feel like you're trying to, like if you're, a lot of times when you do something on the phone instead of on a computer,
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  it feels like you're drawing, getting water from a very, very narrow straw.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  And it's like, oh my God, if I was on my Mac, I could just drink it as fast as I want.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  That's how I feel.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  Exactly.
[47:57.000 --> 48:05.000]  But with the Eero set up, doing it on the phone is actually ideal because it really is just a big fat tap this, tap that type of process.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  Also, the build quality on their equipment is amazing.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Absolutely amazing.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  It feels like Apple quality.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  I really, they can't say that, I guess, but that's what I would say.
[48:16.000 --> 48:25.000]  This is really, it's a Sonos strategy, right, Sonos was ex-Apple people, but Sonos made a thing that the people liked as much as they like Apple products,
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  which is really hard to do.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  It had the build quality, the features, they charged a premium price because they did a premium thing.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  I'll trash a company, I'll name it, I'll say Linksys.
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.000]  You ever have Linksys equipment, and I've had it, but just, don't even talk about the experience of it, but just the type of plastic that they use.
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.000]  They use the cheapest shit plastic that you could ever do, and if you squeeze the device, it creaks.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  As a brand new device, it creaks in a way that you know what I'm talking about, like a cheap plastic gadget.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  Eero stuff is so solid, it is amazing.
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.000]  What did they say here? There's something in their talking points about it.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  Does it give off a pleasant scent also?
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  No, but it has no scent whatsoever, and it doesn't have that cheap scent, you know what I mean?
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  Here, this is from their talking points.
[49:06.000 --> 49:13.000]  Our manufacturing process rejects any performance flaw or cosmetic defense larger than the tip of a needle.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  And I believe it. They look like museum objects. Anyway.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  That's good, though. That's part of the thing.
[49:18.000 --> 49:28.000]  It's Wi-Fi, still painful enough people are inventing more solutions to solve it, like 15 years, 16 years into Wi-Fi being a widespread thing.
[49:28.000 --> 49:37.000]  So speaking of that, it rolls right out of the Eero topic, or Eero read, is the XKCD comic I linked to this week.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Oh my God, that was great.
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  Where, what's his name, Randall, whatever his name is, the comic is...
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  Monroe, yeah.
[49:45.000 --> 49:59.000]  Over time with phone, like starting in 2007, you know, because that's, you know, like the AD1 of the iPhone era, there was this sense of, you know, you'd be doing things,
[49:59.000 --> 50:09.000]  and if you're trying to do it on a cell network on your phone, you'd say, ah, this isn't, this is flaking out, this won't load, or it's not fast enough, or whatever, I got to do this on Wi-Fi.
[50:09.000 --> 50:20.000]  And at some point, a handful of years ago, around 2011 or so, the reliability of the cellular network surpassed this reliability of Wi-Fi networks.
[50:20.000 --> 50:31.000]  And more often than the other way around, when you're doing something on Wi-Fi, you wind up turning off Wi-Fi and turning on cellular to get it to load.
[50:31.000 --> 50:42.000]  And I find, personally, for me, that is absolutely true, and I will even say, not here at home with my Ero setup, and I really am saying that, I mean this sincerely,
[50:42.000 --> 50:56.000]  I'm not saying this because they were the sponsor, but Wi-Fi in general, like Wi-Fi at just like my mother-in-law's house, or my parents' house, or anywhere else where I might have Wi-Fi, or like at a hotel or something like that.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.000]  I never get the Wi-Fi, the hotel Wi-Fi anymore, I just use my phone, unless it's like video.
[51:03.000 --> 51:12.000]  Yeah, it's a funny, I totally, I was laughing my head off when you linked to this, because I was just thought, oh my God, I'm thinking of the number of times when I'm,
[51:12.000 --> 51:20.000]  so I have, like I said, I have a hilarious router setup in my house, and it all works, so I haven't changed it out yet, because I have good performance everywhere, and I paid the money,
[51:20.000 --> 51:30.000]  and so at some point I will just swap it all out for mesh, because this is ridiculous what I'm doing. I have wires running, I'm a Wi-Fi guy, I've got ethernet running all over the house, ridiculous, makes me mad.
[51:30.000 --> 51:42.000]  It's terrible. But so, I'm thinking the number of times I am out of my house somewhere, and it has a Wi-Fi network, and I have to, I'm like, oh God, and I go and I swipe up control center, and I turn off Wi-Fi.
[51:42.000 --> 51:56.000]  How many times are you doing that? I mean, I, we get by, my wife and I get by with a three gigabyte a month pooled plan with AT&T, we are very low, we don't spend that much time away from Wi-Fi networks or the house or whatever,
[51:56.000 --> 52:06.000]  and we're starting to exceed it, because the networks are so bad, and we're like, oh, we're going to have to spend another like $200 a year to upgrade to the next mark, because we're burning through it, because we need it elsewhere.
[52:06.000 --> 52:26.000]  But it's true. Judging by the reaction I got from people, I got a whole bunch of, yes, that's amazing, I never really thought about it, and I have to admit, until I saw that comic, I just never really thought about it, because my first impression, and I think this is true in so many ways psychologically,
[52:26.000 --> 52:42.000]  and it's, for example, just one that everybody who listens to this show is familiar with, Apple, it took Apple 15 years after it should have been the conventional wisdom that this is a thriving company.
[52:42.000 --> 52:57.000]  I would say it was at least 15 years after the consensus of the business world is that this is a very successful company that has a bright future ahead, to 15 years of Apple as a company that's on the verge of collapse, because they were on the verge of collapse,
[52:57.000 --> 53:15.000]  in 1997, and they were on really shaky ground, and people who formed their opinion of Apple as a business in that time, it stuck long after it shouldn't have, because that was the first impression, and it was true at the time.
[53:15.000 --> 53:35.000]  And I think that the fact that cell networks are flaky, and can't be depended on, and Wi-Fi is definitely a better, more sturdy technology than cellular, was absolutely the truth, worldwide, everywhere, and the fact that that's different now, I never really reconsidered that.
[53:35.000 --> 53:46.000]  Even though it was subconsciously, without thinking about it, I was raising the window shade, and turning off the, whatever you call the thing, the control center, and turning off Wi-Fi.
[53:46.000 --> 54:02.000]  No, I had the same reaction for a long time. I was a big fan of LTE when it started rolling out, and we got it here in Seattle reasonably early, feels like, and the first time I was testing it, I was like, wow, I'm actually getting, I forget what the first thing I tested was, like 20 megabits per second, or 10.
[54:02.000 --> 54:13.000]  It was something outrageous compared to 3G, even HSDPA Plus, or whatever it was at the time that was the big thing. It was like, all right, this is really great, and we're at the bottom of LTE.
[54:13.000 --> 54:24.000]  We're still, in the US, we're still, it's not that other countries are that far ahead, but the general LTE flavor that's being deployed, or that's deployed everywhere, is really still the bottom.
[54:24.000 --> 54:32.000]  Like, we're gonna, just like with Wi-Fi, where we started at like, you know, 11 megabits per second, but it was much lower, and then we went up to 54, and higher and higher.
[54:32.000 --> 54:43.000]  Now we have 802.11ac, and there's different models. You can push, if you're lucky, you can push a gigabit per second or more across two different frequencies with your one base station now, right?
[54:43.000 --> 54:58.000]  It's amazing when it works correctly, but LTE, yeah, and there's a more advanced, these Wave 2 AC units that are coming out that are gonna be, that are much better for throughput and range and everything else, because they do beamforming, so they focus energy in the right place.
[54:58.000 --> 55:12.000]  But the LTE still has, there's so much headroom in LTE, and 5G is still a long way away, but like 4G LTE, we will have networks eventually that are hundreds of megabits per second that are just gonna be generally available, and then you have to deal with what the bandwidth cost will be when you're, that kind of thing.
[55:12.000 --> 55:26.000]  But here's the thing, John, this is, I think, the big thing, is that we forget sometimes, I have gigabit internet at my home, which I am delighted with, and I'm paying too much for it, like 100, well, I think I'm paying 156 bucks a month, and it includes a phone line.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  If I didn't get the phone line, it would cost $40 a month more, because that's how bundling works.
[55:31.000 --> 55:44.000]  Do you actually get, what speed do you actually get? I get like 600 up and 300 down a lot of the time. Wow, that's fantastic, that is, wow. And sometimes more, but it's like, you know, it's awesome.
[55:44.000 --> 55:56.000]  My friend, you know, your friend of mine, Jeff Carlson, is gonna come over, we're going to lunch someplace in a few weeks, and he's gonna come over in the morning and just, you know, do his back please, backup, he's got like 700 gigabytes to go, and he's like, can I plug you in for a few hours?
[55:56.000 --> 56:13.000]  Yeah, come on over, use some of my uncapped bandwidth. But most people in the country, so I think the average bandwidth, I just found a number from last year, but it's like 50 megabit per second downstream is now the average, that's because there is more gigabit and 100 megabit per second internet being pushed out.
[56:13.000 --> 56:33.000]  But the, let's see where we're at now, I think it's the, oh here it is, 18 megabits per second is the 10 fastest average speeds right now, so it's still, I think most people in the US have home broadband that's much slower than LTE in the same area they're at.
[56:33.000 --> 57:01.000]  Yeah, at my new house we have much, my internet used to be a running joke about how bad the internet was at my old house, it really was, and it really did, I know Merlin, I still don't know if Merlin believes me, but we've had a couple of, we had that one, one of my favorite episodes of this show ever was with Merlin, and we were talking about Comcast and the stupid web page they had with the giant orange cone that was, if it was in proportion to the van, it's like a 20 foot,
[57:01.000 --> 57:11.000]  there's a dog chasing a cat, anyway, but it really did, in my old house, it really did, the internet service suffered tremendously when it rained.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  I swear to God.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  Oh my God.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  So like if I was set to record the show and I knew, and it was a rainy day, I knew that we were in for trouble.
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  That's because there's old rotted cables, the rain infiltrates and it disrupts the, there are just holes in your coax.
[57:27.000 --> 57:34.000]  I forget how long ago it was, there's an episode, I'm pretty sure I'm not making this up, there was an episode of the talk show a couple hundred episodes ago,
[57:34.000 --> 57:42.000]  might have even been back in the Dan Benjamin era, but it was so many Skype drops because it was a rainy day that we literally edited the show and just put the,
[57:42.000 --> 57:50.000]  just kept the Skype drops in, instead of editing around them seamlessly, we just played the Skype connection sound over and over again.
[57:50.000 --> 58:04.000]  What do I get? I get, so here's what I get, I get, it depends, but I can get, I have some speed tests here where I'm getting 220, 230, 238 down,
[58:04.000 --> 58:13.000]  and that's over Wi-Fi, that's Wi-Fi, but up is on the same, those same tests, 12, 12, 12.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  Yeah, it's super consistent.
[58:15.000 --> 58:16.000]  12 megabits per second?
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  Yeah.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  12 megabits per second, what the?
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.000]  Yeah, see, that's what I love is, so CenturyLink is one of the old baby bells, or no, I'm sorry, it's not one of the old baby bells exactly,
[58:24.000 --> 58:32.000]  it was like, there were different smaller companies, like rural telephone companies, and it all kind of merged, they took over, it was US West and then Quest,
[58:32.000 --> 58:41.000]  and CenturyLink was like Century something else and whatever, so they have like the worst portfolio, they have like all wired phone lines,
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  and they're kind of like a junk, I mean, I'm being too harsh because I don't know all the business model issues,
[58:45.000 --> 58:51.000]  but you know, like Verizon spun off all of its wired phone lines, like Verizon doesn't own any POTS anymore,
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  and Sprint I think got rid of there, so like, excuse me, there's still millions and millions of wired phone lines in the country,
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  even as they decline super rapidly, it's like, you know, how many modems are in use, we're in that title of modems.
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.000]  Oh my God, wait, sidebar, I'm starting to watch Futurama from the beginning with my other son who is 10.
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.000]  We got to an episode in season two, which is a joke about logging, good news everyone,
[59:13.000 --> 59:19.000]  I started, I tried to log on starting weeks ago, we finally got through to AOL, and you know,
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  and it sees they're putting on virtual reality to go this whole thing, and I'm like, oh my God, we pause,
[59:22.000 --> 59:28.000]  my wife and I are explaining for like 10 minutes to my 10 year old, okay, so there was a phone and you dial,
[59:28.000 --> 59:33.000]  and he's like, I'm like, so there was a time when the internet wasn't always on, it wasn't always available,
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  he's like, really, he's just like, looking at me like an anthropologist, like, how did that work?
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  Because we dialed up and it made noises, and it was 1000 times slower than our current connection.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  Maybe more, it might be more than 1000 times slower.
[59:46.000 --> 59:50.000]  What is 56k divided by gigabit? I got a math program here.
[59:50.000 --> 59:51.000]  Yeah.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  But so that was hilarious, but so, I interrupted myself.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  Do the math, can you do the math?
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  I have, yeah, I use Solver, which lets you pipe an arbitrary, S-O-U-L-V-R.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  I love that.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  I can type in, I can type 56 kilobits per second divided by one gigabit per second, and it tells me, wait, I got the units wrong.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  It's in percentage.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  I'm going to put a link in the show notes to Solver.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  I'm doing it wrong, wait, one gigabit per second divided by 56, I did it the wrong way around.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  56 kilobits per second, it, oops, if I can type right in real time, it is, oh, it's, so I have a connection that is 2200 times as fast now.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  I was correct that it was more.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  You're right, more than a thousand.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  So mine at 200 megabits would be, what, divide by five, so like 500 times faster, 600 times faster?
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  Yeah, it's like 400, 446 times faster.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  Yeah, so and the scale of things, right, like, you know, I mean, it's one thing when you say I have.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Did you explain to your son that if somebody picked up one of the phones while you were connected that it would.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  Oh, yeah, my wife was like, Flynn was saying, so you know, so understand, honey, that if you use the phone to connect to the internet, you couldn't use it for something else.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  He's like, huh, he wasn't incredulous, he was sort of like.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  And if somebody picked up the phone, it would instantly disconnect you, and if they quick hung up, it didn't put you back on, you had to start all over again.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  That's right, that's right, there was that call waiting feature that was added in some version of, I don't know, V.something, so that was hilarious.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  Yeah, you could even have your connection drop just because a call came in, and you didn't even, even if you don't answer.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Oh, I know what everybody, so CenturyLink, so this is the thing, the reason we have Gigabit Internet in Seattle by our phone company is that they are desperately trying to,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  they're putting in fiber as fast as they can possibly string it up in order to replace the income that they're losing much more rapidly.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  So, what I'm hoping, I assume, and this is probably rude of me because, I don't know, it's a company, I assume at one point, at some point,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  CenturyLink will be unable to sustain their business model, and I will have to switch to Comcast, which now has something comparable that's cheaper but has its limits.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  So, I have uncapped internet. When I switched over to Backblaze, gosh, a while ago now, I switched over and I had like, I don't know, 1.2 terabytes to upload.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  I think it uploaded in like a day or something, like a day and a half, it was ridiculous.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  I sent it to 10 concurrent threads, it's like, you're uploading at 500 megabits per second, I'm like, right on, and I had my whole, you know, life back up there.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  So, I know, and so I'm paying through the nose for it, but as a home worker and as what I need, I could have saved money and got 100 megabits per second connection.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  I would spend it if I could. As far as I know, what I have is the fastest internet that I could possibly get in Philadelphia, because we're 
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  It'll keep changing though, yeah, home of former Adelphia, Comcast headquarters.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Well, no, they're still there. They have the big, they're building a new tower one block over.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Yeah, so you got a 
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Two biggest skyscrapers in town. Welcome to cable town.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Oh my God.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  But that's why we don't have fiber. There is no fiber in Philadelphia, because Comcast keeps it up.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  But DOCSIS, DOCSIS 3, this requires, and they have to keep rejiggering channels because they give up certain things, but people, they don't need as much, and eventually you will be able to get it, but it'll be subject to the one terabyte, not cap, but I guess non-overage fee thing that they do.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  But it'll come. I mean, I think it's fascinating. I thought actually the rollout of much higher speed internet would take a lot longer than it has, because I thought the incentives were in keeping it scarce and charging through the nose.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  But I think we're seeing just small enough competition, and I think the cellular pricing on some networks, especially with like T-Mobile with its unlimited thing, even though you can't tether, like the migration to mobile services away from desktop computers and conventional television watching, especially through tablets,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  I think is forcing the wireline fiber cable DSL firms, I think they've had to up what they do faster than they wanted to.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  I've been sitting here looking, I wanted to see how much internet I've been using, and I couldn't find the app on my phone, and I swear to you, I'm telling you the truth.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  So you know how Comcast rebranded their home services as Xfinity, right? Because the Comcast name is so sullied that they have to call it something new.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Something you can't spell, right?
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  But their app that you use to like see your account and stuff, the icon for the app, the icon has some kind of little logo, and then it says on the icon Xfinity.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  But the name of the app, this is for the iPhone, so I can't rename the app, the name of the app is called My Account.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  I swear to God, go to the app store and look for it. I swear to God.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  That's great.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  Like they literally don't even know how you name apps. I mean, that they put the name on the icon.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  So anyway, my whole problem was that you can't just go to whatever that, what's the search feature called?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  You know, when you pull down on the iPhone and you can search for your apps, whatever you call it.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Oh, the spotlight thing or whatever spotlight?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  So you can't search for Xfinity or Comcast, you have to search for them.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Oh, because it's not named that.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  It's called My Account.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  It's great spotlight work.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Oh my God, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  Let me see here. How much, how much internet did I use here? I don't know. I can't find it in the app.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  I don't know. We use, we use a shocking amount. I thought it was a mistake. I really did. I thought that that was like, well, that can't, we can't possibly use that much per month.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  But I think having it's over a terabyte, I think so. Yeah.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  Yeah, I think it's pretty easy. If you stream video and you have backups, do you do internet based backups?
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  Right. You got backblaze or something.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  Yeah, I do.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  Yeah, it's, I mean, I'm sure that I am sending several hundred gigabytes a month with backblaze because I take, if you take photos and you use iCloud photo library and you do anything else, you're, you're just, I mean, I'll go out, you know, my wife was like, why is my phone full?
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  And I'm like, oh my God, you have like, you know, 15 gigabytes of images on there and she had a sync issue and whatever, but you don't feel like you're creating that much. And it just adds up so fast cause the, and I'm shooting raw sometimes and on my cameras cause I like shooting raw and editing later.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  So yeah, it's easy to add up. I think Jason sells out himself, but I think he easily crosses a terabyte a month too with his service. So then you have to pay the overage fee.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  I don't know if I get, I don't know. I don't even look at my bill, so I don't know. I don't know if they're hitting me with overage fees or not. I just have auto pay on and just pay it.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  They're charging you for a modem you didn't rent 15 years ago probably.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  No, I finally, you know what, it was great. That was one of the good things about moving is that we finally got rid of it.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Yeah, well we like canceled the old account and so any kind of thing that went back in my head that was like a nagging, like am I paying for like some goofy, you know, like you said, like a modem 10 years ago or whatever, like I know that I'm not.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  So like I have a good, whatever you want to call it, a clean, I was going to say conscience.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Yeah, they charged me, they were, I had business service for obscure reasons because I moved, they wanted to charge me. They have a 75% cancellation fee for your entire contract if you move a business, if you cancel business service within the term, which should be illegal and somehow is not because, so it's ridiculous.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  So I moved from a business location to my home and I kept the business service and they absorbed all the costs, which was nice and eventually, you know, I switched to what I have now.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  They started, they'd started charging $5 a month for a modem because they didn't have, you couldn't get like an over the counter one that worked with their business flavor, which was fine.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  Then at some point they upped the rate to like $13 a month and the modems were like 50 bucks. So I finally realized this and canceled it.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  Then they just kept keep charging me and every month I'd be like, you charged me again. They're like, oh, we should be able to take that off.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  And then like at some point I got somebody who's like, oh, this is ridiculous. I mean, I got someone actually at Comcast who thought it was ridiculous that I had to be working that hard to get it off.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Like somebody must've been new and they like even think they gave me a credit even like they pulled it off and it never got charged again and I got like $20 credit cause it's such a hassle.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  But you know, that's the business model and that person didn't know they weren't trained yet.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  I was flashing back on the Ryan Block call with Comcast.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  I can't find my usage. I have no idea.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  It's the perfect Comcast infinity experience.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Oh, here it is. Data usage. Here we go. Data. Data usage overview. 95 gigabytes used this month.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  And that's OK. That's August.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  We're days in as we record this two and a half days.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  Right. So that's good. That's all right. That's what it's there for to use it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  I am getting I am getting it. So what they promised me is 200 megabits down and 10 megabits up.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  So the 12 megabits up that I'm that I'm seeing over Wi-Fi is actually more than they promised. But.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  Oh, my God. It's cable town. Wait till you get better. Someday.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  All right. Let's take a break. I think our next sponsor is our good friends at Fracture.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  Oh, do I love this company. You know, Fracture.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Fracture is the photo decor company that is out to rescue your favorite images from the digital ether.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  You shoot photos, you pick the ones you like, and then every couple of months go to Fracture, take your favorites, go through your your your photo favorites and get a couple of them printed.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  And what they do is they print them directly on glass and they add a laser cut rigid backing.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  So what they ship you, you open the box and it's ready to display right out right out of the box.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  They even include the wall anchor if you want to hang it on the wall. And what you get is absolutely amazing because it's edge to edge.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  There's no frame around it. It's just an edge to edge piece of glass with with your photo on it print.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  And it looks like it's printed directly on glass. It's not like they take a piece of paper where the where the photo is printed on and glue it to a piece of glass.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  I don't know how they do it. I don't know anybody else who does anything like it. And the effect is simply amazing.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  It's like the platonic ideal of how to hang a photograph because there's nothing else to distract from it.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  It's just the photo on a piece of glass. It's almost like the ideal of where like phones are going, like as the rumors come of the bezels on the iPhone getting smaller and smaller and smaller.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  Well, there is no bezel on the on a fracture print. It's literally nothing. It's just edge to edge photo.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  It is so great. Fantastic gift idea. It is a gift idea for family that you will never, ever, ever get anything but the highest compliments on.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  And each fracture is handmade in Gainesville, Florida, from U.S. source material in their carbon neutral factory.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  So for more information and 10 percent off your first order, go to fracture me dot com slash podcast.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  And then don't forget to mention the talk show in their one question survey.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Guess what the question is? Where did you hear about fracture? That's literally all they do.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  So it helps support the show when you remember that you came from here. So go check them out.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Really, really. This is just another it's another sponsor that it's just a pleasure to do the read for because I'm such a big fan of their product.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  It really is a great company and a great product. All right, moving on.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  What else do we have on the agenda as we knock China out? You want to do the Apple Park?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Yeah, let's talk about that. So let's talk about that sometime in the interim between the last episode of the show and this one.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  There was a really, really fascinating and well-written and beautifully photographed profile of Johnny Ive and Apple's new campus,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  Apple Park in the Wall Street Journal's like Weekend magazine.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  Lots of interesting details. I guess I should put a link to the article in the show notes.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  But the part that stuck out, and at least in our community, were the pictures of the workspaces for like, you know, the whatever you want to call them, the enlisted men, you know, the rank and file Apple employees.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Yes, it's largely open floor plans, which is not the way infinite loop is set up infinite loop.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  Now, Apple's existing campus and, you know, whatever, they have more than a campus there.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  It's funny because when I was out there back in April for that little Mac roundtable that a handful of press people got invited to,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  we got to walk around and we went to the new cafeteria, which is, according to this article,
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  I guess I kind of guess somebody said that to me when we were at lunch before we had the meeting.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  But it was built as sort of a prototype of the cafeteria in Apple Park.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  There's a new Cafe Max and it's huge and it's spacious and it is it must be three stories tall.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  And the fit and finish is just phenomenal in a way that everything lines up like the floor tiles where they meet.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  If you look, meet perfectly where the beams are that are supporting the weight and then you look at the ceiling and there's tiles in the ceiling.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  And they're not just beautiful, but where the seams are perfectly align their center with something else.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  It's there's there's nothing that you could say, oh, if you had thought of it, you'd have that centered between these two things.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  Everything was like that's so beautiful. But the walk from infinite loop, like where you park, like where the press usually parks.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Yeah. To to this cafeteria, it's a couple block walk and you just realize as you walk it.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  Oh, and the other thing I got to see a lot of, too, is because I stayed at a hotel across the street.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  I forget the name of it, but it's right there by the I didn't instead of staying in San Francisco, like I usually do.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  I just I was like, I'm just here for Cupertino, so I'll just stay there.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  But the walk from my hotel to where I had to go in the morning and a nice, nice little 10 minute walk.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  Beautiful because it's sunny California. But you realize as you walk down Bandly Boulevard, every building is apples now.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  They just bought everything. Anything that's not like a restaurant is is an Apple office.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  And so they have a bunch of offices at the, quote, old campus that aren't really part of what you would think of as the old Apple campus.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  They're just off any office space anywhere down there they've bought.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  But anyway, that is to say, I still think most of those offices, though, even the ones that are just random real estate pickups that Apple's made in the last 10 years.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  Yeah. Most Apple employees have their own office. That is a very long way of me getting to Apple.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  Most people at Apple have their own office. They always have and they always did.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  And those who are moving to the Apple campus to now won't.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  I'm shocked by it because it's not like it's not like Apple is run by a bunch of managers who are disconnected from what they do.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Right. This is, you know, I try not to say if Steve Jobs were live X and I feel like this is one of those things I'm I'm baffled by because I again,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  I don't think Apple is confused about internally about how people work. I wonder about their own history.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  I wonder about that, though, because it seems like Jobs really was deeply you know,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  they he had they had the spaceship, you know, famously his last public appearance was before the Cupertino City Council had to pitch this thing and they had drawings of it.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  And so I feel like he might have, you know, he and Johnny were both on board with this.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I guess, but it just I mean, there's decades of really good research about productivity.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  I mean, people were throwing up studies left and right, because it's not it's like we all have our own anecdotal experience.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  And anybody who's a programmer or writer, I would say virtually. Gosh, can I say like 100 percent of people?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  It's probably not 100 percent, but I don't know anybody who's a programmer or writer.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And I'm not disparaging people in other professions, but I know specifically where your job is to stare at words and type on a screen and maintain a state of flow.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  With that, you're not on the phone all the time, where if you're on the phone, you also need privacy and whatever.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  But you're not on the phone all the time. You're not walking around. You're not constantly in meetings with other people.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Your job is as much of it as you can maintain is a relationship with that screen, right?
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Is what you're doing. I don't know anybody who wants to be in a place where people are walking around them.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  They want a place where they can close the door and have as little visual disruption as possible, as well as oral disruption.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  So I can't imagine talking to any 10 people in Apple who did those jobs and any 10 of them saying, yeah, that'd be great.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  I'd love to be in a place where I have to wear headphones all the time.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  And I have to almost wear blinders to keep from being disrupted by people walking.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  And they're not doing it because they're cheaping out. There's nothing about this.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  There's nothing about this project that is about being cheap.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  It is like an Apple product and like any Johnny Ives obsession. It is about, you know, maybe not quite spare no expense,
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  but it is, you know, spare little expense at making it exactly what they want.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  And looking at the photos, it's not like they're saving space per se.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  It looks like there's a lot of really kind of opened spaces for people to work where you could easily have,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  even if it was two people to an office, which is not uncommon, or some other thing, at least some spaces that could be closed.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  I don't get it.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  I realize that there are a ton of people listening to us talk about this now who work in an open floor plan.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  I realize that that is certainly the modern way to do things.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  I know that a lot of startups, it's almost assumed that that's how they're going to lay out the floor plans.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  I realize whether it's for cost cutting reasons or cultural reasons,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  because I think like startups think it fosters a collaboration or whatever.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  The difference is that Apple already has a culture and a company culture.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  Right.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  And it also is sort of self-selecting where if you're a software engineer and you like having an office,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  that might be one of the reasons you went to work for Apple in the first place.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  I don't know. I find this very, very, to me, alarming.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  I honestly feel like it's and I've been saying for years and I always think I have to give him credit.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Guy English had a blog post.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Oh, man, it might have been I don't know if it was right before or after Steve Jobs died, but it was right around that time.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  And just like what are the biggest what's the biggest thing Apple should be worried about?
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  And his take was the number one is talent retention.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  The single biggest, yes, single biggest threat and concern for Apple as a company is talent retention.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  And that, you know, this was written, you know, he wrote it at a point where the iPhone was clearly this.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  You know, it was on that trajectory where you could see what a sensation, you know, it was going to be for years to come.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  And obviously was built by a fantastic army of employees, designers, hardware engineers, software engineers.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  But that having you know, that's a conquered thing.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  And that those type the type of people who can make, you know, a world where everybody has a flip phone to create the iPhone.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  You know, those type of people are drawn to new things.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  Let's do let's tackle the next amazing new thing.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  Not keep making the best, you know, the new 10th iPhone.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Not that, you know, and obviously there's a ton of interest.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  We might if we have time, we might even get to talk about it.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  There's a ton of interest in the 10th iPhone.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  But it's, you know, you could lose those people if they're bored, you know, and there's all sorts of other reasons that people might leave companies is that there's other thriving companies in the area that might offer them more money, etc, etc.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  So there's, you know, we could spend a whole show listing the reasons that the challenges that Apple has at maintaining the talent they have.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  Where they work, your work environment is absolutely huge.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  Because it's every day. It's all day, every day.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  It's one of the biggest to me, it's one of the biggest things possible.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  And think about the think about the people who work at Apple.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  It's not just like any random, you know, if they have 10,000 software engineers.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  So it's not just any random 10,000 software engineers from the area.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  It's a self-selecting group of the sort of people who care about the things that Apple cares about, which is like, how nice is this?
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  Is this, you know, is this app nice to look at?
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  Is the user interface logical?
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  You know, that Apple draws people who care about those things.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:38.000]  And it's good for Apple that they do because then it reinforces, you know, when the quality of your app or the design of your app draws engineers who are interested in designing nice apps, it makes the apps even better, right?
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  Well, one of the things that, you know, people who care about stuff like that care about is they care about like their work environment.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  I mean, I'm sure I know that there are people, I got email from them when I wrote about this, that there are people who are like, I work in an open office.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  And I don't, I don't really like it. I'd love to have my own office, but I don't care.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  It's all right. I put headphones on and I don't care.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  Although, well, some of the open offices, I mean, the one advantage of cubicle farms is that you get, you lose some of the visual clutter and some of the noise clutter too.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  So if you're literally in an open office and I've seen, you know, I think Wired when they published that big thing of their, the $3 million office space they opened that looked like it was for a photo shoot a few years ago.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  That editor has since left, you know, and they were laying people off after that. It's great, great optics, great optics.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000]  Anyway, that space had a lot of spaces that looked intolerable to me because you're just, you know, you're going to be cheek to jowl with other people.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  There's no, you're just sitting at like long tables and things.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  And I see some of that in some of the Apple photos too, where you're just going to be like among people.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Yeah, it's not even a cubicle. It's, it's like you're, you know.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  No, cubicle would offend Johnny's sensibility.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  I have a funny story that's like, it's an anecdote that I would relate to this, which is my grandfather, one of my grandfather's first cousins, so my first cousin twice removed, was the first chair, or sorry, second chair oboist in the New York Philharmonic for many decades.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  And he came through when I was growing up in Eugene, Oregon, the New York Philharmonic came through Eugene, Oregon.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  We had this beautiful new convention or a concert hall and the local whatever boosting group managed to book them.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  And so we got here and play and spend some time with him and he said, I love your hall so much.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  You can hear everybody can hear every other instrument.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  He said, you know, Avery Fisher Hall, which is the famous hall that was built for the Philharmonic, was originally called Philharmonic Hall.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  It was built in 19, I was looking this up, it was built in 1962.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  He said, we were on tour when the hall, they were interviewing the architect who was building the hall and he said, what is an overrated material for concert halls?
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  And we said, oh no, and we get back there and we play in the hall and it's terrible, so dead you can't hear people, two people away.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  And I found an article from 1974, I just searched on the official hall, 1974, this article the New York Times is discussing what a disaster this space is.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  And they made some changes over the years, whatever.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  But he said, we know there's concrete in the floor, they swear there isn't.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  It took many years, I think it was only 10 years ago they were renovating the hall, maybe 15.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  They discovered there was concrete under the stage, they had been told there was no concrete, they pulled it out and the halls, you know, acoustics changed.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  And I was like, it was such a perfect example.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  We're going to make a beautiful new conference hall, it's specifically designed and you're telling the people who know what they need, no, no, no, no, you don't need to hear, you know, wood is an overrated material for acoustical properties.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  Like, ah!
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  So, I sort of feel like I'm hearing this, that story right now.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  I got tons of feedback from Apple employees who either read my site or maybe listen to the show.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  And if any of you are out there and have an opinion on this, I would love to hear from you and you can trust me.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  I am proud to say that there's not one person who's ever told me anything in confidence that might, you know, harm their job if I publicize it or whatever.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Not one person has ever told me anything in confidence that they have come to regret telling me.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  I know how to keep my mouth shut.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  So anyway, if any of you at Apple have interesting stories to tell about this open office space, I'm all ears.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  I'm particularly interested if Apple did, because, you know, Apple famously doesn't do focus groups for its products.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  Did they have stakeholder meetings with programmers and marketing or whatever to ask them what they wanted from the space?
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  I'm guessing not.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  Here's a story I heard that I cannot confirm because it was third hand.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  So I cannot confirm it. It could be totally, totally false, but it sounds true to me.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  And I think it would be easily checked because it's if it's true that there are people will know about this.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  But I heard that when that floor plans were announced that there was some either meeting or however it got where Johnny Suruji's team that he's in charge of Apple Silicon.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  The A-10, the A-11, all of their custom silicon, obviously a very successful group at Apple and a large and growing one with a lot on their shoulders.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  When he was shown the floor plans, he was more or less just fuck that. Fuck you. Fuck this. This is bullshit.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  And they built his team, their own building off to the side on the campus.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  So they're not even not only are they not going along with the open floor plans, but that Suruji's team is in their own building.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  And they might I maybe internally they're saying it's for security or that it's you know, that they're they're just off.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  You know, that there's a logical reason for it. But my understanding is that the building was built because Suruji was like, fuck this.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  And my team isn't working like this.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Don't I remember too that isn't the spaceship is already totally outstripped, right? Like they they built it.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  They already have more people. Yeah. So that's going to be a fraction of the can I talked about Amazon for a second?
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  This will sound like a segue or whatever, but it's really about this. I'm working on a story right now for Fast Company.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  I'm not giving away a secret by it's not out yet, but I'm looking into like it's not a secret.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  There's nothing proprietary about it. It's just I'm living in Seattle.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  John, I don't know if you know if you've seen any of the coverage about what's happening to my city.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  Does it make the newspaper like, OK, it's crazy.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  I know we were just talking about it privately, but I did see it somewhere. I did.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Outrageous. We have we have more cranes.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  We have almost twice as many cranes in our skyline right now in the city as Los Angeles, which has six times the area of Seattle.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  We have more higher percentage of open jobs in software and related fields than Silicon Valley.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  We have, you know, we have the richest or second richest, actually the first and second richest people in the world in our area.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  We have.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  That would be Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates in that order.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Yeah, they're they're competing right there. Well, except I think it shifted back.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  They lost the bucket.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  It ebbs and flows by Microsoft and Amazon stock price.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  We have so much construction going on.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  So we had this minimum wage debate and we got a socialist on the city council and she is a firebrand.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And she reignited this thing in our liberal progressive town, which is very proud of itself for being liberal progressive.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  And but, hey, you know, wages. They're like, no, no, no, we don't want to rock the vote.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  She comes in, she makes us her thing, and then everybody takes it up because they don't want to be left behind.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  We now have we are on track.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  We have a 15 dollar an hour minimum wage if you're a large employer, 500 or more employees and you don't pay towards medical benefits.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  And if you're a small employer and do, it's 11.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  We're on track. We have a staggered introduction.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  So it's inflation based. So it's going to keep going up in a few years.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  It's going to be like 18 dollars an hour. It's going to keep going up from there.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  So if everyone predicted doom and despair, all the restaurants would close, whatever.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  We have more restaurants now, more openings, all the restaurants, the restaurant tours who threatened to leave have opened more off.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  You know, it's hilarious. We have a shortage of short order cooks.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  We have we're becoming Aspen in terms of people being able to live in the city affordably and work in the city, even though the wages have gone up.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  You know, the 15 dollar an hour is a starting point for these larger companies.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  And you can be like a bottle washer and you can get a rate of 16, 17, 18 dollars an hour.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  So we're in the middle of this weird, crazy, overwhelming prosperity.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  Our housing prices went up by more in the last period of time, like 18 percent versus like five percent nationwide.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Like everything is out of control here.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  And Amazon and I say this with all happiness to Amazon is they're built.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  They have two giant buildings downtown. They built these signature sphere biosphere thing that's actually I was appalled by when I first saw the plans.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  It's actually really cool.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  I've been letterpress printing a book at a school that is like two blocks from the Amazon headquarters and they're building a third big tower.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  They have like 30 something buildings they own.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  Amazon is leasing almost 17 percent of all office space in Seattle right now, of all office space, not just downtown.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  The whole pace, they have eight million square feet and they're on track to like 10 in a couple of years.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  They have 10,000 open jobs in our I think it's that's just like white collar jobs, not including I mean, just in our state, I think mostly downtown.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  So the pace, it's just unbelievable.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  But the most interesting thing to me is they chose to stay downtown.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  They were they were kind of always around there, like Jeff founded the business in his garage in Bellevue, which is on the east side, not Seattle proper.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  And that was just a temporary thing.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  But then they had an office down south of what used to be the Kingdome.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  We still call it Soto next to Pecos Pit, the best barbecue in Seattle.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  Then they were in the beautiful heroin district of Seattle.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  That's why I worked there for about six months, 11 years ago.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  We were across the street from the methadone clinic.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  And then they started then they moved to the Lex Luthor building on the hill is the tallest building or the highest point in Seattle with a giant building on it.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  It's an old medical center.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  They leased the whole thing.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  They immediately outstripped that.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Then they started having all these they started leasing all these Paul Allen buildings and then they have all this stuff built.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  So Vulcan and some other local Vulcan is Paul Allen's real estate company.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  They've been selling property to Amazon, other local contractors anyway.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  So it's this massive, massive building boom.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  And it's not just Amazon, it's Google and Facebook have bigger and bigger operations.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  I was in Facebook's kind of small temporary offices, which I think has like a thousand people in it.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  That's not quite in downtown and they're building.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  So it's it's out of control.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  But here's my thing.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  They're downtown and Apple is in Cupertino.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  Facebook's in what Mountain View or something?
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  They're out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  All these other companies are often the burbs because they got founded out there and they grew and there's no they're not part of the life of the city.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  So this whole long thing is employee retention.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  A lot of young people and a lot of people looking for a change in life who are not necessarily young, young.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  They want to be in a city and they're making wages where they can afford to have a condo and apartment.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  That's very nice.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  And it's within walking distance or we have streetcars and light rail now and all this stuff.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  So being, you know, the spaceship in the suburb is maybe not the best.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  And it's not cheap. Seattle's not cheap, but it's the housing is not crazy.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  Like San Francisco, San Francisco.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]  We're like half or something.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  We're like half as much, I think.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  But it's it's it's growing very rapidly, but we're still much.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  But that's it's a big it is and it is a recruiting problem in it.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  And it certainly is true for the younger you are, the more likely you are to want to live in a city.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  And it's a big problem for these valued companies because they can shove all the money they want and make the buses as nice as they can.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  And they are, by all accounts, very nice buses.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  You know, you know, so that if you live in San Francisco, you can catch the Apple bus instead of driving to work and be annoyed.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000]  It's like still an hour plus on the on the bus, right?
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  Right.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  Something or more than an hour, at least on the.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  It depends on the time of day.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  There are a lot of Amazon employees who are living in an apartment that like a view of the water and they go downstairs and they walk a few blocks there at work, which may be healthy or not.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  But or we have we like there's all these condos.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  I mean, I have I've lived in Seattle for 20 something years and I much prefer talking to nonprofits to about how this has affected them.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  Nonprofits that serve like endangered communities, women who need shelter and homeless, voting homelessness and so forth.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000]  And everyone's saying the same thing is like this is really hard and everybody that housing increase.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  But would we prefer the reverse?
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  No, like less money, no growth, no jobs.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  No, that's terrible.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  So we can with money and resources, we can kind of help people and lift up folks because there's the work there for them.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:24.000]  But it is it is like being in one of those cartoons where there's going bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump in the background the whole time.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  So anyway, I understand I don't know what the original Apple plan was with the new campus with it was if the if the original idea was that almost all Apple employees would move there and they would like it was.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  I think I think so.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  And I seem to recall that Jobs kind of tackled it the way he tackled his deep, deep involvement with Pixar's.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  Campus, you know, and that he, you know, which by all accounts is, you know, Pixar people love their their building and they love.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  You know, there's these ideas that he had that, you know, everybody would have to, you know, restrooms are located strategically in a way that you're going to bump into people who aren't just from your team, you know, and and and stuff like that.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000]  And that all of these ideas that that he had worked out.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  And I think that that was sort of the idea, a lot of the idea of Apple Park, or at least the spaceship, that it would be designed in a way that would foster people bumping into each other and blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  But my understanding now is that Apple isn't isn't leaving any office space.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  I don't know. Maybe some of that's what I heard is they're keeping I think they're keeping everything because they've grown faster than they could have.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  I mean, I thought they were gonna try to get almost all their core teams.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  So maybe there's outlying teams or different groups or maybe I don't even marketing wouldn't be in there. I mean, and there might be marketing, maybe not.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  But there might be some small, you know, some of the small buildings that aren't you wouldn't think of as Apple buildings when you drive down the street in Cupertino.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  Maybe they'll they'll get rid of. But, you know, the main Infinite Loop campus is going to remain fully occupied.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Yeah, I think it's interesting. This is actually one more Amazon point related to that, though, is because Apple's in, you know, they're in a suburb and they're not I mean, you've walked there.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  I mean, one if you're in one spot, but there's not enough restaurants to absorb this many people.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  And Amazon specifically, I met with the VP of real estate. They specifically designed their facilities.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  They can only feed about a third. There's only like room to have a third of the staff actually eat lunch inside the buildings.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  And they have all these restaurants and cafeterias and whatever.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  So they are essentially either forcing people to bring food in and people who are working in these environments typically buy food.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  Let me bring it in because they're making they're paying piles of money to eat out.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  So there's a bazillion restaurants and they also encourage local restaurants.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  So it's not just big chains, a lot of like one off or small chains all across this neighborhood.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  And it's part of their philosophy of creating this, you know, downtown or this environment.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  And Apple began by being in the burbs. Like, I don't know if you've been to Microsoft's campus, but it's kind of this very self-contained world.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  I have never stepped foot in the state of Washington.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  No, is it? Well, someday you will get to a record. I can't explain why stuff doesn't happen.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  I have I have I probably have more friends in and I really do.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  I have enormous you know, Brent Simmons is up there.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  I know a bunch of people on the Molt's. Oh, that's funny.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  I didn't really never been here. Well, I mean, Jesus come out at some point.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Well, I mean, geez, with you and Molt's, I mean, it's like half the regular rotation of the talk shows from last year.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  But I've never had reason to go there. I've never had reason to go there.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Microsoft's off in the suburbs. They started out there. They're kind of, you know, they're suburban kids that started Microsoft and they stayed out there.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  But, you know, you can drive places from campus or some stuff within walking distance, but not very much.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  So, it's really an insular thing. And I just think, again, I think this is one of the reasons Amazon built its whole thing.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  They planned this partly not just to have room for stuff, but they planned it partly to appeal.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  They are creating a lifestyle mall of sorts around their offices.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  And they're saying, when you come to work for us, you're not going to be off in a sterile thing with an hour commute away.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  I mean, you can choose to live out of town. You can choose to live wherever.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  And they're paying highly competitive salaries so people can choose to live essentially wherever.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  But, like, and they've been underwriting, they underwrite some streetcar service.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  They've been helping promote transit taxes and ballot measures.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  So, like, you can take streetcars to Amazon from all these different places now.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  It's a very different thing than this, come to the spaceship, or maybe the spaceship.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  Maybe you'll be in our old building and we're off in the suburbs.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  I don't know. I do think, judging from the private feedback I've gotten from some Apple employees,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  there is, I'm 100% certain there's going to be some degree of attrition based on the open floor plans
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  where good employees are going to choose to leave because they don't want to work there.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  And they don't want, you know, if they don't find.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  And, like, the one email I got from somebody was perfect.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  And it's perfectly Apple person sensibility.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  He's not screaming. He's not angry.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  You know, it's just, you know, it is what it is.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  And he's dealing with it. He said, you know, I'm working on something.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  It's a new thing that I think is going to blow people's minds when we ship.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  And, like, a typical Apple employee, you know, offers me no clue what it is.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  And, of course, I don't ask because I know he's not going to tell me, you know, this is how it is.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  But he's working on some team. He's working on something cool.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  He definitely wants to see it ship. But his team is moving to Apple Campus, too.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  And then once they ship, if he doesn't like it, he's out.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  And he's been there. He's an 18-year veteran of Apple. He's been at Apple for 18 years.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  So, and I got a couple of others from people like that, too.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  Like, I'm not going to quit before they move me there.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  I'm going to see what it's like. But if it's as shitty as I think it's going to be, I'm out.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  Yep. I can underyep. It's like, what's it like to go to work every day and have your entire day, you know, disrupted, if that's what it turns out to be?
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  It may be that they'rethat what we've seen isn't as full a realization of what it's going to look like.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  But it's clear there aren't a lot of offices with doors.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  And even the spaces that look like they're closed spaces are all glass.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Right.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  Look, I haveI discovered in my relatively old age here, I clearly have sensory processing disorder.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  It's a very interesting thing. I'm trying toand it's very common among folks who are programmers and engineer types like myself.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  I've done a lot of programming in my life. I have a mind for it. And there's an affinity, I think, between different things.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  And I'm super highly attentive to anything. So, high registration, it's called.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  And so, I see and it's very hard for me. I get keyed up. And I can'tI try to work in a coworking space. I really like the people and the space.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  It was open. It was very affordable. And even with headphones and a screen I was staring at, it was just too much stuff around me.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  I could not focus. I had to go back into my quiet, day-lit basement. So, I have a lot of sympathy for the folks who are going to be in that environment.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  I think I have a touch of that. You know what I do? I cannot help but look at a TV.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  And so, whenever we go out to eat as a family, I strategicallyand I don't make a big deal out of it.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  It's not like I'm a princess on the P. And I absolutely have to have a seat with no view of a TV.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  But I do trywhen we get like, oh, here's your table, I try to pick a seat where I don't have a sight line to a TV.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Because if I do, I'm going to be looking at it. And my wife's going to be like, what are you looking at?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  You don't even know if it's like a basketball game or something of two teams I don't care about.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Like, why are you watching that? And it's like, I don't know. I don't know. But there's a TV in my viewline.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  I'm going to be looking at it.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  There's a book called Too Loud, Too Bright that I've been reading and marking up.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  I don't mark up books. And this one, I've never done it before. My wife's like, you should mark this up.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  I have highlighters and like those post-it tags all over the thing.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  Because I'm justit's like I feel like I've been written in a book.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  It's a bunch of different traits you have about yourself. You didn't realize we're actually all connected to one neurological state.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  And there's ways to train yourself out of responsiveness to it.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  So, I haven't gotten to that part yet. But you desensitize yourself so you can function better in the world.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  If you walk into Costco or Ikea and you need to go cry in a corner, you may havewell, you may be just a normal person also.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  But you may have this sensory processing as well.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  I have a friend who works at Apple who I know is not looking foris definitely on a team that's moving to AC2.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  I keep calling it AC2. I can't get used to Apple Park and is not looking forward to it.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  He has notI don't think he'she hasn't said anything like, if I don't like it, I'm leaving.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  He just thinks it sucks.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  And so when I linked on Daring Fireball, I don't know if you saw it, but I
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  I saw that. It was like you Rick-rolled me and I'm like, wait, what are these?
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  I love a post like that. It's like to really make this like a director's commentary, like me talking about how I write Daring Fireball.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000]  So I wroteI had a post, a link post, very short.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  The headline was video footage from one of the open workspaces in Apple Park.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  And I wrote, really does seem like a different vibe from the Infinite Loop campus.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Some engineers are gettingare getting their own offices, but they don't seem great either.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  Oh my God.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  And the link goes to footage from Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  And there's a great tracking shot of this open area.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  It's aif you've not seen Brazil, it isit is 1980.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  It's like the pitch is, let's do 1984, but make itwe'll make it a comedy.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  Except it's a
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  It's such a great film.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  A more profound tragedy at the end than 1984.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Sidebar, have you seen the made-for-TV edit?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Yes. I used to be upset when I was in the 90s.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Travesty!
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  When I was in the 90sin the 90s, I actually thought maybe I would like to be a filmmaker.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  I really have such a profound love of movies.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  And a friend of mine and I from college, we got deep.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  And we just startedwhen our eyes were opened to the great world of cinema and that it was
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  and that old movies, there are old movies that are every bit as good or better than new movies.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  Don't let, you know, just don't let the production quality or like the black and white, you know, like deep dive.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Like watch 20 Hitchcock films.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  Watch, you know, just went on benders like that.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  But Brazil became like one of our obsessions where like we watched it over and over again.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  And then when we found out that there was a terrible TV edit, we're like, well, we have to watch it.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  And it was great, though, because we had seen, you know, Gilliam's vision of it so many times that we knew it by heart.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  And so it's not just the brutal parts of the TV edit.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  It was like even the little things like, oh, my God, why would they take that out, you know?
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  But anyway, I linked to that.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And it's a very great movie.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  Anybody listening to this, if you've never seen Brazil, I swear to God, move it to the top of your like.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  I don't know if it's on Netflix, but if you go watch it, it is such a wonderful, wonderful movie.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  But it's a dystopic, open floor plan workspace.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  And it's a tiny admission is nice to get a little high as a kid back when before it was legal in my state and various states.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  And I was huge Brazil fan.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  I'd watched a bunch of times and it comes on TV and I'm at some friend's house and we're toasted.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  And I actually thought I had a psychotic break because I watched the TV.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  The first time I'd seen the made for TV version and it didn't end the way I remembered.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  I thought, oh, my God, I'm hallucinating.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  I was like, it's terrible. My hallucination is so awful.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  Nancy Reagan was right.
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  No, but anyway, I sent I sent after I posted that, I sent my friend at Apple a DM and I just wrote I wrote I just wrote this was for you and send a link to it.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  And then he wrote he wrote that was the best post of the week.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  So anyway, Apple employees are definitely have strong opinions about this open floor plan.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  And for the most part, it's it ranges from hatred to, at best, ambivalence.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  This is this is something to keep an eye on, in my opinion, moving forward.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  Anyway, I got to take a break here. I got to thank our next sponsor.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  I got it. We got to wrap up the show. We've been getting close to the end here.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  And I want to thank our friends at Squarespace.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  Make your next move, make your next website, make your next move with Squarespace, make your next website using Squarespace.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  What is Squarespace? I can't explain strongly enough that Squarespace is literally an all in one website platform.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  You can register domain there. They host the site.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  They have the CMS so that if it's like a blog and you have updates, you know, you do it all through Squarespace.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  And it's a great interface for something like that. You can host a podcast there.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  You can have a store there. And if you have a store, if you need to have stuff to sell, the commerce part of it is all built into the Squarespace platform.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  So it's not like, oh, now you have to go to PayPal or whatever you want to use as your back end and figure out a way to hook it into.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  There's nothing to hook in or hook up. It's just turn it on and say, I want to have a store and I want to start entering SKUs and pictures of the items.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  That's all you have to do. I cannot explain just how all in one, the all in one nature of Squarespace is.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  And I also cannot emphasize strongly enough just how many of the websites you use on a daily basis are, in fact, Squarespace sites.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  You'd be shocked. I swear to God.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  Go look at Pixar.com. Pixar.com and then view source on it and you will find in the source that it's a Squarespace site.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  I don't know if the whole Pixar.com is. I wouldn't be surprised if they have parts that are not.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  But the home page with the big Cars 3 thing is made with Squarespace. I mean, this and I cannot emphasize in the back of my mind.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  I always think that if there's a reason that people don't try Squarespace is that they think because this is what I would think if I was out there listening to me tell you to try Squarespace.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  I would think I don't want to pick from 10 templates and all 10 of them look like a Squarespace site.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  You know, like back in the day when you'd install WordPress or something like that. And there were only like three default themes.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  And so as soon as you looked at a site, you could say, I can tell they use WordPress because it's a default thing.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  Squarespace is so profoundly open to design ideas that, you know, you don't have your brand on it to the degree that you would a site that you built from the ground up the old fashioned way with code.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  So go check them out. The website is squarespace.com and slash talk show.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show. Or maybe it's slash Gruber. I forget. Try them both. Try slash slash Gruber or slash talk show.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  And one of them is going to give you 10 percent off your first order. My thanks to Squarespace.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  Want to talk about some letterpress?
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  Yes. Let's do that. I want to do that because I love, love, love getting people to pitch their things on this.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  So you tell me about you've got a book that is on the cusp of coming out.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  It's yeah. Well, it's been a very interesting thing is I've been it's a printing a book of reporting I did about I say reporting.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  I keep thinking of saying like, well, it's a book of writing on. It's like, no, these are actually reported pieces I did.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  Some appeared in the Atlantic, some appeared at Meh.com, which has had me write stuff for their forums and some I've written for the book or for other places.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:13.000]  And it's reporting on things like the history of unintentionally or intentionally blank pages, which dates back to like the 1470s.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  It turns out people started to mark this page intentionally blank.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  And like whether I wrote a piece for the Atlantic about quotation marks, whether we're going to stop seeing curly quotation marks,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  they might disappear because people have lost the desire or finesse and was there ever a reason.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  And so I collected I was like, you know, I want to do something with this.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  I want to do something for myself that's new and creative in 2017.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  And I called up the woman who runs the letterpress program at the School of Visual Concepts here in Seattle who had taken a letterpress classroom.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  And I did some letterpress back in the 1980s also.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  You know, I've been a graphic designer for 30 years. I studied graphic design. I've designed books.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  I'm like, you know, I called her to see if she had any ideas about where I could get something like this printed, thinking some offset or digital printing thing.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  And she said, you should print it on letterpress. You should be our designer in residence for this year.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  We're starting the program. You should be our first person.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  I'm like, OK, great.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  So I threw myself into classes, got up to speed, designed the book.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  And then the last till about last week, I spent six weeks printing the book by hand on a proof press that's about 70 years old.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  Flatbed proof press.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  And it's getting close to being done. I got to do a little more work.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  I have endpapers to print and a cover.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  And then I've got a book binder who's actually putting the thing together for me and handing off that piece of expertise.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  But that's the project.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  And so you did a Kickstarter.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  And you only sold 100 copies of the book.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  Yeah, it's a sign-numbered limited edition run.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  I'll have some.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  I got to tell you something right now.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  I got to tell you.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  I knew you were going to do this.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  I think you told me before you did it.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  And right up my alley, I love, number one, I'm just fanning your work.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  But I love graphic design.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  I love the idea of doing something by hand.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  So, of course, I was on board.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  And then the Kickstarter came and went.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  And I just wasn't paying attention.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  And I didn't get in.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  So I didn't get a copy of your book.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  Well, you know, we'll have some artist proofs afterwards.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  So I'm going to have to make.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  So it's this whole.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  So actually, I'll tell you about this, too, because I thought this was this is actually great for you.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  Can you hook a brother up, Glenn?
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I can.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  I will have.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Yeah.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  So you got to do.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  There's like a yield issue because this is the first time.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  I've never printed a book before.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  I've done other letterpress projects.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  The scale of this.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  And for starters, I didn't.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  This is not a handset book.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  This is a book I'm using.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  A process called using photopolymer plates, which is a technology used for printing packaging
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  materials mostly.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  But there's a subculture of it that uses the same material.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  There's service bureaus.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  And so I designed this in InDesign, picked appropriate fonts that would work, and licensed
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  correctly, and sent it off to the service bureau.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  And they sent me back printing plates.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  And it's like a rubbery material.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  So you expose it.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  Just like in the old days, you'd make film, and the film would be exposed to an offset
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  plate, and you'd wind up with an offset plate that would go on press.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  I get this stuff is relief material.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  And it's used mostly, like I say, like 99.9% of it is for printing plastic bags of mulch
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  and the labels on your stuff.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Anything that's an irregular surface or whatever is printed with flexography using photopolymer
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  plates.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  And anyway, so this is printed on a letterpress, but it's not printed with, it's not metal
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  or wood type.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  Although I did, I put an Easter egg in.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  There is actually a line set in six-point italic type that's in the book that's a little
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  joke that I did in metal.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  I did the last thing I did is that last little bit.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  But so there's just, so the thing I realized in doing this, I was working on this and I'm
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  kind of churning away.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  I'm on this press that has, it runs the ink rollers automatically.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  So, you put ink on a metal roller and it distributes it, and it has a reciprocating thing that
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  moves back and forth to make it even.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  So, you can get presses that are even more primitive where you're actually running a
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  brayer over the stuff you're trying to print.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  In this case, I've got like, this is a motorized thing.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  It takes a big part of it out, but there's still a manual crank.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  So, I'm sitting there.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  It takes about three turns of the crank to go from one end of the press to the other
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  to do each sheet.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  And I wound up, I think I've done about 12,000 passes on the press to do this book so far.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  So, right now, the status of the book is that it's been printed.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  And so, it's on paper.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  There are sheets of paper.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  It's on paper.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  And you had to do, did you have to do the thing where you had to collate it so that
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  like, page 11 is on one side?
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  Yeah, oh my God.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  And page 47 or whatever, or you know, 88 is on the other side, right?
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  I know you love this stuff.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  So, I'll tell you.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  Yeah, I actually posted, I had this planning document.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  I started with a simple document.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  And I was like, well, I should just lay this out.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  I needed the imposition.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  And then it got more and more complicated.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  It's like this incredibly dense thing with like ink color.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  And I'm using a paper that has a deckle edge.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  But the parent sheets are 25 and a half by 38 inches.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  So, the deckle is along the two, it's along the long edge.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  And it's machine made.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  So, it's made continuously.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  So, it only has a deckle edge on, this is the, so folks don't know.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  Deckle edges, that's that rough edge you see.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  Sometimes it's made by like actually being stamped out by a form.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  So, a lot of books get a book club edition book.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  It has a fake deckle edge that's stamped out.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  And you can tell it's fake because the deckle, the edge is even all the way across.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  If it's a true deckle edge, it's the edge of the form, which is called the deckle,
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  that the wood pulp is sieved on top of and the water's drained out.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  It's pressed and dried.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  If it's a true deckle edge, it's feathery on the edge.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  That's how you tell the difference.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  So, I got a paper with a deckle edge, but because the sheets are so big,
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  I can only have a deckle edge on every other sheet of paper.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  This is a 64-page book finished.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  I'm printing it four up on each side.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  So, each press sheet is four pages on each side.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  So, in order to get the deckle edges to alternate,
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  not only did I have to figure out how to impose four 16-page signatures,
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  but also rotate each sheet, one of the folios,
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  the two-page things that are going to be folded in half when it's cut down,
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  I had to flip that so the deckle edge would be alternating when the final book was made.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  So, I made folding dummies out of paper and numbered them and took them apart
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  and then turned this into a digital document.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  Being a printer is sort of one of those things,
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  and I think you and I have somebody's shared interests,
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  but one of the other things, I really love mechanical watches,
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  and I think watchmakers think like programmers.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  If I was living 100 years ago, maybe what I would have done is get into watchmaking
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  because it's all if this, then that.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  This will turn at this rate, and if once every eighth of a second it's going to hit this,
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000]  and when it hits this, it's going to turn this,
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  and one logical this, then it will touch this,
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  and then the second hand will tick one eighth of a second on the dial of the watch.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Printers have the same thing,
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  where printers sit there and can strategically, algorithmically,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  well, one goes here, two goes there, three goes there,
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  and that's why I always loved spending time in the print shop back in my graphic design days.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  I loved going there, and I just loved picking the minds.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Well, show me how you set that up, and most people who take pride in their work,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  and that's another thing, too.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  I don't know anybody who ever went to work in a print shop is like a printer
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  who didn't take tremendous pride in their work.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  They're all in there, and they could spot errors a million miles away.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  Yeah, you wouldn't last is the kind of thing.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  But here's the thing.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  At some point, actually, I was talking to my friend Becky Slatkin,
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  who is one of the funniest people.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  I'm going to embarrass her if she's listening to this
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  because she's one of the funniest people on Twitter, doesn't tweet a lot.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  She's an iOS developer back east.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Rebecca Slatkin has her Twitter handle.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  I recommend following her if you're a programmer
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  or you like programming-related humor because she's just so dry.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  There's no vermouth in her tweets at all.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  And I was talking to her the other day, and she's asking how the book was going,
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  and I was like, you know, I just realized something.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  You're programming tweets and my letterpress actually have a lot in common.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  She's like, what are you talking about?
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  And it was, I realized this letterpress I'm working on, it's like Xcode.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  I'm not even kidding because you see the metaphor.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  It's like I have a device that I didn't make, and it's kind of wonky and weird.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  And when you're using letterpress printing, you have these parameters.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  You have where the relief, it's a relief process,
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  so you have to raise it off the bed of the press by exactly.918 inches.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  It's type high.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  So, anything that takes ink should be exactly that high, no higher or no lower,
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  which is a whole thing when you look at the history of how type was made,
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  that it was possible in early industrial days that they could get it that exact.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Gutenberg was a genius, right?
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  So, there's that thing.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  Then you have ink rollers, which can be raised or lowered,
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  and the ink rollers have to have the relationship
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  because you don't want to overink, you don't want to underink.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  Then you have this thing, and what I'm using is a cylinder press,
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  and there's a timpen on top, which is a piece of paper,
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  like a kind of slightly waxed oiled paper,
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  which you place the paper that you're printing on over.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  The timpen is packing underneath, and the packing has to be raised to,
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  I mean, working in thousandth or five, ten thousandths of an inch increments.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  We have a digital caliper.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  So, I'm constantly working on the difference between, say,.047 and.046 inches,
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  and sometimes a little bit less than that.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  So, this is the degree of precision you're working with on equipment that,
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  again, at 70 years old, and we have presses in the shop that are like 120 years old,
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  that are a little different.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  So, I realize I'm messing with this machine.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  I'm like, this is really, this is so much like programming.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  Even though I'm working in this very analog environment,
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  you're making tiny changes, you're tweaking stuff,
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  then you kind of run your tests and you see you're looking at the feedback out of the machine.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  It's a little bit of a black box.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  You're looking at it, and I'm building in my head a mechanical model of the press,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  and the better I can model in my head what the press is doing
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  and all the relationships between all the parts,
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  the better I can program in all these settings that are all, you know,
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  I'm pulling off these rollers and there's like a set screw,
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  you use a hex wrench and you're turning, there's no mark.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  So, I have to turn something like one eighth of a rotation of a screw
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  to move the ink rollers up, you know, one thousandth of an inch.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  And it actually struck me as a long-time programmer on a low level,
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  like I'm a scripter, not an Objective-C writer,
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  it struck me how much this felt like actually debugging code.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  Yeah, debugging, it's that right mindset, right,
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  where you've got to start working backwards, you know.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  Yeah, fine detail.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Well, let's just do this and at least show us if that's the problem, you know,
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  like putting a print statement in.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  And then like with Xcode, sometimes you just baffle,
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  just throwing out errors and you're like,
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  why won't you sign this code and upload it, what's the better?
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  All right, so I want to mention, before we move on,
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  I want to mention that the print edition of the book is a limited edition.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  There is some mention on your site that there are going to be a couple of copies
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  that you might sell for and donate the proceeds to a charitable cause
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  or something like that.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  I would like one of those, that's what I would like to do.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  I don't want a freebie, I want to put some money towards a good cause.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000]  I got to figure out the best cause, it might be ACLU,
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  it might be American Islamic Relations, I got to figure out a good cause,
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  because I feel like this was a great thing.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  The Kickstarter funded all my expenses for all materials,
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  it's kind of breaking even, but I feel like this year especially,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  I'm like, this was for me, it was great,
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  but I want to do something that affects other people.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  I feel like the ACLU, they don't really have much going on.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  I know.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  They've been doing okay with fundraising.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000]  I want to find like another group that needs a little more money.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000]  But I'll have some artist proof.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  So this is like this incredible thing too.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  So I started, I won 100 copies of the book,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  so essentially I started with printing 200 pages,
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  or 200 sheets for each press sheet,
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  because I knew things could go wrong,
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000]  because actually some pages have three colors on them,
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  which means multiple passes, which means more to go wrong.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  So I'm hoping I'm going to be able to get out about 125 to 140 copies
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  at the end that are good quality copies,
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  and then I'll have some to give to people who are help with the book,
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000]  and then I'll have some to sell as artist proofs.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  How much pressure did you feel to not have typos?
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  What's the over-under, do you think, on how many typos have made it in?
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  Are you aware of any now that you've printed it?
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  Are you aware of any typos already that now you can't fix?
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  No, I know. Isn't this a terrible feeling?
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  I mean, it's like the worst thing when you're used to working with interactive media,
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000]  to go like, oh my God, I can never fix this.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000]  So far, I have not spotted anything that's wrong in the book,
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  which is astonishing, because I've been looking at it a lot.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  Some of these pieces that already appeared in print have been proofread.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  Others of them had not, or I'd taken an earlier,
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  longer form than it wound up in online.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  And Jeff Carlson, he has no responsibility for errors,
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  but he did an editing and proofing pass for me at the end of the whole thing, too.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  So, it's pretty, I mean, I've looked at it so much,
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  I think I've fixed everything.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  But you know what I'm thinking of doing, John,
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  is I think there was enough interest in the book,
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  and I've been thinking of doing an offset edition that'll be twice as long,
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000]  because I've got a bunch of stuff I couldn't fit in that's in the same vein.
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000]  I just wrote a long piece for Wired about letterpress and technology,
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  and I have the rights back to that after 90 days,
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  so, which is only a couple months away.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  So, I may do an offset edition that's like 128 pages,
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  and I'll, including, I have, with this campaign,
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000]  I did both the limited edition,
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  but there's also an e-book that's going to include writing about the process of making the book,
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  so that'll wind up in an offset version, too.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  And, I definitely want to mention this,
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  is that the e-book, you can still get it right now.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  It's, or you could...
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  Yeah, I'm selling it on the site,
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  so you go to the, you can go in, I've got a commerce page,
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  and you can buy a copy of it.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  Where is it? What site is it? What's the best one?
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  It's, if you go to, it's a good question.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  I know, I'm so organized about this.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  It's, I've got a destination page,
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  and of course, I can't remember what it is.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  If you go to glog.glennf.com,
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  I will put a, I should put a link up,
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  because I had a link up about being able to buy copies,
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  and what is it? Oh, it's glog.glennf.com
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  slash pans dash on dash patronage,
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  which is a terrible URL.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  All right.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  But that's, that's the URL.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000]  And then, there's also a keepsake
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  that's part of the project that I'm printing as well.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  That's not related to the book that I'm still working on.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  Okay, so anyway, this is great.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  I am so looking forward to it.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  And you know I'm passing through this.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  It's a lot of fun.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Does that, when you, the room where you printed it,
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  did it, does it have a good smell?
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Oh yeah, it's great.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  And I'm using, it's, I mean,
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  the room is full of metal type and wood type.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  Most print shops, to me, have the most amazing smell.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  I just love it.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000]  Yeah, the ink, you know, it's a,
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000]  it's an incredibly physical thing.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  So I would be sometimes printing
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  for eight or nine hours a day,
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000]  and I'd look at my Fitbit,
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  and I'd walk, you know, like 10,000 steps in the shop,
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  just walking three steps forward,
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  three steps back to crank that thing.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  The smell is sort of, the closest I can think of
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  is it's sort of like any kind of machine shop
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  has that smell of metal and grease.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  But ink has a smell, too,
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  and paper has a smell that sort of gives a print shop
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  a unique, different than like any other something else,
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  like a metalworking shop or something.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  It's a great smell.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000]  Everything feels good, too.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  It's like everything has a texture,
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000]  and you're listening.
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  It's also this whole thing,
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000]  one of the things that letter press printers
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  talk about a lot and I've been learning
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  is there's a sound.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  It's a machine.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  So if you get the wrong sound,
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  then you should be able to hear that
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  and know that something's wrong,
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  and I've been tuning into that.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  We have a platen press.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  It's a pinwheel thing where you spin a wheel,
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  and this one has a foot pedal on it, foot treadle,
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  and I recorded it in slow motion one night,
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  and then listening in slow motion,
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  it makes a tolling of a bell.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  The spring action, when it's slowed down,
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  it's just bong, bong, bong.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  It's this beautiful thing.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  One of the most amazing things,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  I couldn't believe it, but back in college,
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  I don't even know how I walked into this,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  but there was a trade show here in Philadelphia,
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  like a big convention of print, print stuff,
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  and people trying to sell you big, expensive,
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  professional print things and stuff like that,
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  and I got to go with the dean
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  of Drexel's College of Design.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  I don't know how,
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  because I wasn't in the College of Design.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  I guess it might have been the year after I graduated
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  because I was hired to build their website,
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  and I guess that's how I got involved,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  but I did take a lot of class.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  Anyway, but it was me and the dean
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  of the College of Design touring this convention,
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  and he said, hey, you wanna take note of something.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000]  Notice how many of the guys,
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  when you shake people's hands or you just walk past them,
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000]  notice how many people are missing.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Do you know what I'm gonna say?
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  Notice how many people are missing a finger
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  or like the tip of a finger.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  And the idea is that so much happened so fast
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  in print shops, and there's so many ways
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  that you could lose the tip of a finger,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  and you tour here, and it's all these guys
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  in their 50s, 60s, guys who had spent their career in print,
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  and it was unbelievable how many people were missing
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  like the tip of a finger or like a pinky
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  or something like that.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  And he said, there's an awful lot of people
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  who lose the tip of a finger,
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  and it's the sort of mistake you only make once.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is, this is,
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  we have in the north, in Seattle,
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  we have a fellow who's a letterpress repairman,
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:53.000]  and it's sort of his full-time job.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  He prints, too, but he used to be a motorcycle racer,
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  and he had an accident that made it impossible
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  for him to race comfortably after that,
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  but he knew how to take apart and rebuild motorcycles,
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  and he gets kind of a wind of letterpress
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  and discovers, and this is, I mean,
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  I'm talking about just several years ago,
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  not like 30 years ago, he's a young guy,
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  and he realizes letterpresses are much simpler
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  to his mind than motorcycles.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  So, he learns, reads the manuals are all online.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  I mean, you can find these scanned Google books
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  of things from 70, 100 years ago,
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  and he learns how to take these things apart,
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000]  and because of him, if it weren't for him,
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  I think a lot, there's a pretty big
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  northwest letterpress community,
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  and I think Seattle would be impoverished
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  without his assistance, because he knows stuff
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  that people haven't known for, you know, 50 years
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  or 40 years, he has relearned it
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  and taught it to other people.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  Yeah.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  Yeah, I believe it.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  I believe that one person could make a difference in that.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  Oh, yeah, he's missing part of a finger.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  That's why I was thinking that.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  Yeah.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  That's the sad part.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  Hey, let me take one last break here
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  and thank our last sponsor,
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  and it's our friends at MailRoute.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  You know who should handle your email security
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  and delivery?
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  People who do only that.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  That's MailRoute.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  MailRoute's a team of people
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  who've been in business for a long time,
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  and all they do, the whole company,
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  is just devoted to email.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000]  That's really what they do.
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  They don't even host email.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  What they do is they know how to filter email.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  Postini went away, McAfee and MX Logic,
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  they had similar services.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000]  They've gotten out of the business,
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000]  and even Google has come out and said that
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  if you want, that they recommend
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  that you use a gateway service like MailRoute
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  to filter your mail.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  Here's what you do.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  You keep your domain that you already have for email,
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  and you just change the MX records.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  That's the DNS so that everybody knows
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  that like at daringfireball.net.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  Where's the server?
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  The MX record says to another email server
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  that's sending email.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  If you're sending it to somebody there,
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  that's where the server goes.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  It goes to MailRoute first.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  They filter out all the junk,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  and then they just forward it immediately
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  like in a hundredth of a second
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000]  right on to your existing mail server.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  In other words, what would have come
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000]  right into your mail server
[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  instead just goes through a thin filter
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  at MailRoute first and then goes on to you,
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000]  and they keep all the junk and viruses,
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000]  and that's all that they do.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.000]  That's their service,
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  but because that's all they do,
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000]  this is like the Cadillac of mail filtering.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  I mean, this has got everything you would want.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  They have APIs so if you're a programmer,
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  you can customize the way all this works.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  They have all sorts of great things
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000]  so you can get like if you want,
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  you can get like a weekly digest for every user,
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  every email address that gives you a list
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  of here's what's been filtered.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  Here's the list of emails
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  that were like maybe on the fence,
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  and you can quick eyeball that list
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000]  to see if anything got flagged that shouldn't,
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  or if you want that more frequently,
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  you can get it more frequently.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  If you don't want to get it all,
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  you don't have to get it at all.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000]  You can just set it and forget it.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  It is absolutely a fantastic service,
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  a do one thing and do it as well as you can type thing.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  I don't know of any other company that does this
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  that does what MailRoute does as a dedicated service.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  And by the way, get a 30-day free trial.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000]  So you go try it for an entire month,
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  completely free of charge.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  And if you don't like it,
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  all you have to do to undo it
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  is just change your MX records back to where they were before.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  I just can't explain how easy it is to turn this on
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000]  and how easy it is to turn it off
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  if you're tempted by this free trial.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  Go to mailroute.net slash TTS, TTS for the talk show.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  And if you use that code, if you use that URL,
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  you'll get 10% off for the lifetime of your account.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  As Marco Arman says on ATP,
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  it's the best deal on the internet
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000]  because you could use this for 20 years
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  and you're still getting that 10% off every single month
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000]  for the lifetime of your account.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  My thanks to MailRoute for sponsoring the talk show.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  We've got to go into speed round now, Glenn.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  We've been going for a while.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  Boom, okay.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000]  Apple inadvertently leaks HomePod OS,
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  spilling many beans.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000]  Oh, I was embarrassed.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  Wow.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  It's always that thing of like,
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000]  did somebody get fired?
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  I don't know.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  It's just, wow.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  That's the worst thing for them.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  I almost, I suspect nobody got fired
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  because I think whoever was ultimately responsible for that,
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  nobody feels worse than they do.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  So what happened is Apple was apparently,
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  this I can't prove, this is what I've heard,
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  was on the Cosper, maybe they already have,
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  but they were about to start rolling out a lot,
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  I don't know, hundreds,
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000]  let's just say hundreds of prototype HomePods
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  to employees, maybe even more.
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  Maybe even more.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  And because it's a revealed product,
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  the wraps are taken off, they can do this.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  And apparently this software update that got leaked
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  was meant for them.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  And I don't know, I don't know enough,
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  so that's the why of why in the world
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  would Apple have an OS release for an unreleased product?
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  Well, it's sort of like the cold opening.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  It's being released to employees at this point.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  But it was a world readable disk image.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  And there's some guys like our friend Stephen Trouton Smith
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  and a couple of other people who,
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  man, did they know what to do.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  So apparently it's running a beta version of iOS 11.02.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  I think the numbers get weird.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000]  And what they usually do, for example,
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  with the public betas and the developer betas
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  of iOS right now, inside Apple, there
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000]  are versions of the beta versions of iOS 11
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  that are running on the prototype new iPhones
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  or pre-production, whatever stage of production
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  they're at now in August.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  And the version that goes to me and you,
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  or you, good listener of the show,
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  if you're in the developer beta or the public beta of iOS,
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  they have, in programming terms, the pound
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  if def statement in C, where you can say in your code,
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000]  if this variable has been defined, do this.
[02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  And if it's not, then that code doesn't even
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  go into the compiler.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  It's called, you know, I want to make this
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  as layman friendly as possible.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  It's the C preprocessor.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  So this gets processed before the code goes into the compiler.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  And so all this stuff specific to like the new secret iPhone
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  Pro or whatever doesn't even hit the compiler
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  when they do a build for public release.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  Because this HomePod OS release wasn't
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  meant for public consumption, none of that stuff
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  was defined out.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  I almost feel like that had to be a mistake
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  because I could see why the HomePod specific stuff wasn't.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  But why in the world the release had the images on?
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000]  I guess it didn't really.
[02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  I guess that's it.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  That the icon that leaked was somehow
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  related to the HomePod somehow.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  I don't know.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  But anyway, all sorts of stuff leaked out,
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.000]  including an icon showing the D22 codenamed iPhone
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Pro with the notch, the bezel to bezel design
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  and the little notch at the top for the camera
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000]  and other sensors.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  Boy, what a screw up.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  Yeah.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  It's funny.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000]  I feel bad.
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  Well, it's interesting because you feel bad for the people
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  involved because this isn't like,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  I had this discussion with somebody the other day.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  It was about like leaks at companies.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  And like, well, I like to find out stuff
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  that's coming before it happens.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  It's also, you know, when stuff's purposely leaked,
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  you're like, well, unless this is the company's intent,
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  this is somebody who kind of wants to be, you know,
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  there's like, there's putting color about an issue
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  and there's like, OK, here's what's coming next.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  When it only has a commercial interest,
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  there's not a like public service interest
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  or, you know, something's wrong and it's being fixed.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  In this case, it's just, it was just a screw up.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  And so it's sort of, the whole thing is sort of sad.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  So let me, among the details that were revealed,
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  this is what I noted in my post on Daring Fireball,
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000]  the sound effects of the HomePod.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  So you can hear some of the things that,
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  the little WAV files that they have,
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  the icon for the new high-end iPhone matching the descriptions.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  Now, that's a bad one.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000]  That's bad.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  But on the other hand, if, for example,
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  if the poor soul who was ultimately responsible for this
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000]  is a listener of the show,
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  you can feel a little better because there are part leaks.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  I mean, it only confirmed what the rumor mill had already said.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000]  It wasn't like this came out of the blue
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]  and nobody wasn't expecting it.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]  That's actually, at least at an icon level,
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  exactly what we as close followers of the company were expecting.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  The codename for the new high-end iPhone is D22.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  As far as I can tell,
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  I did find a link to an Apple Insider report from back in December.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  That was the first instance I found of D22,
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  where some random source in China from the supply chain
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  leaked a thing that said,
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  here's a schematic of where the SIM card is moving
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  and the codename for this phone is D22.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  Well, it turns out that whoever that source was was exactly right.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  It is codenamed D22.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Is that really a big deal? No, it's not.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  You know, it's not like that.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  Apple doesn't really talk about those codenames.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  It's not like you spoiled something from the keynote.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  We've got the display resolution, 1125 by 2436.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  So that's interesting because it's actually different
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  than what Ming-Chi Kuo said.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  He said it was going to be like 12 something by 2800
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  and that there would be an 1125 by 2436 area within that.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  That's the usable display.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000]  But from what Stephen Trout and Smith has uncovered,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  it doesn't seem like it.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000]  It seems like that's the actual display.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  So there's a little bit of a mystery there.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  We learned that the HomePod does have a color display,
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  and we learned that there are APIs for the phone
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  to have an infrared-based face recognizer.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  Well, all of those things only confirm rumors
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  that have already been out there.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  Right. It's nothing particularly new, but it's still...
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  I mean, Apple's always fighting against the sale
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  of the next model they haven't made yet, right?
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  And every detail about something that's going to come,
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  although I think they've defeated, in some level,
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000]  they've defeated that cycle a bit
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000]  because they're now in a routine cycle for now years,
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000]  and people buying a phone know that in September-ish
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  there's going to be a new series announced.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  It'll be available either shortly after, within a few weeks,
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  and it's going to be somewhat better.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  So it's not like people don't know when they get a phone,
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  what's going to happen.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000]  The iPhone 8 or whatever it'll be called,
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  I think the word that it's going to be an expensive phone
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  doesn't mean that people are not going to buy a phone now,
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  either, if they're planning to or they need one.
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  But I assume sales get really slumpy around now,
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  except for people who just don't care.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  They're just like, it's 20 bucks a monthly server.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  I think it's surprising how many people don't care.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  I mean, obviously, you can see it.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  You can look at the charts,
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  and you can see that there's a huge spike
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  when the phones just come out.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  So the October, November, December quarter has a huge spike
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  because even though the phones
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  usually technically go on sale in September,
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000]  it's just like at the end of September,
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  and they often have trouble
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  or almost always have trouble meeting demand,
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000]  and so the sales don't go on the books
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  until they actually sell it.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  So it's that October, November, December quarter
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  is the biggest quarter.
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  But it's also the biggest quarter
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  because it's the holiday quarter,
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  and people get iPhones for the holidays.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.000]  I mean, the iPods used to have that huge spike
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  in the holiday quarter, too,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  because they were amazing gifts,
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  and I think it's a little bit easier
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  to give somebody an iPod
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000]  because you're just giving them,
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  it's like giving them a Walkman.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  You're just giving them an electronic device
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  and you're on your own,
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000]  whereas giving somebody a thing
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  that comes with a $30 a month or an up, you know,
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  I wish my cell phone was $30 a month, whatever,
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  but you don't just give somebody an iPhone
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  if they didn't ask for it,
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  but I'm sure there are tons of kids
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  and families and spouses and stuff
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  who it's like, you know what?
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  You can get me this year.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  I'm gonna get a new iPhone
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  and give it to me as a Christmas gift.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000]  Yeah, just add it to the, yeah.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  But I'm, you know, it's actually,
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  I'm encountering this problem
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  because I want to sell my iPhone 6S.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000]  I have a 7 Plus,
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  and I was reluctant to switch to it,
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  but I'm like, yeah, it's probably time,
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  but then I'm like, well, I'm gonna get a new phone
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  because of the computational photography stuff
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  that I'm interested in.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  I will almost certainly get a new phone
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  when they come out,
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  so I'll have two phones to sell,
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  and nobody wants a 6S right now,
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  even though it's in good shape
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  because why buy it at, you know,
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  400-something dollars a used version of this
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  when the price is gonna drop
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  after the 7S ships,
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  and people will then, you know,
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  be able to get it for 100 bucks.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  So I think people who are looking at a used phone
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  are actually savvy about waiting
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  because have not been able to find a,
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  usually can sell any iPhone very quickly
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  if it's in good shape,
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  and this time, not.
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  Yeah, I don't know, though.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000]  Anecdotally, a lot of people in my family,
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  like, over the summer have been asking me,
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000]  like, hey, I'm thinking about getting a new iPhone.
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  Which one should I get?
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000]  And I'm like, just wait.
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  And they're like, oh, and they're like, why?
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000]  And I was like, well, the new ones
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000]  will come out in September,
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000]  and they're like, really?
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000]  And I'm like...
[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  Well, although a lot of the features don't appeal,
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000]  I mean, some people don't see the incremental features
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  as more than like Chrome.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  No, and that's why they...
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  If you don't study it, you're like,
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  well, it's a new collar, right?
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000]  It's like, no, it's not a new collar.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  It's actually a whole better device.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  And so even though there is a spike,
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  they still sell, I don't know,
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  40 million of them every quarter.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  They'll sell 40 million, you know,
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  or 10, 15 million of them this month, you know,
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  in the month of August,
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  in five weeks before the new ones come out.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  Because there's, most people don't care about that,
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  you know, in the same way that, like,
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  most people, including me, frankly,
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000]  like, I bought a 2006 car in December of 2006.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  You know, the 2007s were already out
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  because I didn't give a shit, you know?
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  I don't know what the difference was
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  between the 2006, 2007, but I knew...
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  I didn't give enough of a shit
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  compared to the thousands of dollars that cost less, so...
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  And I think that there's an awful lot of people
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  who feel that way about their iPhone.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  They just don't care.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  They accept, they know, I'm sure they believe that
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000]  for people who are truly tuned in like we are
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  that we know, oh, my God, there's, you know,
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  it's gonna, the camera's gonna change from, you know,
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000]  F1.8 to F1.6 or whatever.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  They don't give a shit.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  They don't even know what the hell that means, you know?
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000]  You tell them.
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000]  What's the Merlin Mann line?
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  Isn't it something like, it has more mega-florps.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000]  Yeah, mega-florps, exactly.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000]  That's what people think.
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000]  Mega-florps.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  The thing that, I'll tell you,
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  the one statistic that floored me,
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  I still think about on a regular basis,
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000]  is when Jason Snell backed out the
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  how many simultaneous production lines there has to be.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  It was Jason, right?
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  I think it was.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  How many simultaneous production lines
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000]  there has to be?
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  No.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  Was it him?
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  Oh, well.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000]  And maybe Jason quoted it.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  I confused the two of them, I guess.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000]  One of those guys.
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  But that how many simultaneous production lines
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  have to be going to achieve the number
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  because of the end-to-end time it makes
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000]  to assemble an iPhone.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000]  So, it was some thousands, right,
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  that are being made simultaneously.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000]  And I thought that floored me more than,
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  like, 40 million is a number.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000]  But when you're like, no,
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000]  there are a thousand phones or more
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  at the same time going down parallel production lines
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  all over Foxconn plant, you're like,
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  that is astonishing.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  But that came out, you talked about,
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  I don't want to get too deep,
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  and I know we're near the end of the show,
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000]  but you talked about that issue of the scaling
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  is like any part you make,
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  you can't come out with a certain kind of innovation anymore
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000]  because it has to scale to hundreds of millions of times,
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  has to work instantly.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000]  The availability has to be so extraordinary.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000]  It's going to be a problem they have for years now.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  I'm sure of it.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000]  It's, you know.
[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  Well, I think they're, I mean, we'll see how it goes,
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  but I think they're, with this D22 phone,
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000]  I think that they're trying to get their,
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  wiggle their way out of it.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  Yeah, I mean, again, it's like I said.
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  They're only going to sell 50 million of them
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000]  instead of 200 million or something, right?
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000]  I don't know.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  I don't know.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  Let's see.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  Also, the other thing was that that year ago
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  report that had the D22 code name
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  also said that internally it was nicknamed Ferrari,
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000]  which I thought was, you know.
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  And so since they had the D22,
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  it certainly adds a lot of credibility
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  that the Ferrari was a real nickname for it,
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  and like I wrote on there, Fireball Ferrari
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  does sound like a nickname for a product
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  that might be a little bit more expensive.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  I really don't think it's going to be Ferrari expensive,
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  you know, but I'm pretty sure I'm right
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  that this is going to have a surprisingly high,
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000]  surprising to many people high price.
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:08.000]  Well, we shall see.
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.000]  Last but not least, the other thing I had on my list here
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  was this Facebook post from Vic Gundotra.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000]  Oh, my God.
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000]  Oh, my God.
[02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  So you may or may not remember.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000]  It's like this catnip for you.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  Right.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  I still haven't linked to it from during Fireball
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  because I haven't had time because I,
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000]  it's almost like, did this really happen?
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000]  So Vic Gundotra used to work at Google,
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  and he was the, you know, he was in charge of Android,
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000]  or not really in charge of it, but he was,
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  like he was the ringleader of their keynote in 2010
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:43.000]  when they most harshly went after iPhone and Apple directly
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  with, you know, just like, you know, if it wasn't for us,
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000]  meaning Google and Android, we'd live in a world
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  where one man, one company controls the future,
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  you know, this sort of dystopian, you know,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  Steve Jobs controls everything
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  and has all sorts of quotes over the years.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  I'll put some links in the show notes,
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  but more or less tearing into Apple for being closed
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  and closed as bad and open as good.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  He had a post on Facebook where singing to high praises
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  the portrait mode on his iPhone 7 Plus,
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  and the money line is bottom line.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  This is a quote from Vic Gundotra,
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  who's doing something else now.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  He's left Google a couple years ago.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000]  If you truly care about great photography,
[02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  you own an iPhone.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000]  If you don't mind being a few years behind,
[02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  buy an iPhone.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  Oh, my God.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  It's so rude.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  It's true, but it's also.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  The funny part to me was reading the comments,
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  and he's obvious.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  I don't know how Facebook works exactly
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  because I've never had a Facebook account,
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  but this post is available.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  It's world readable, so I could read it,
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  and I could see these comments,
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  but there were an awful lot of people who follow him
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000]  or whatever you do to people on Facebook who, you know,
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  are in a circle, whatever the hell they have,
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  who are obviously Android fans,
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  and they were...
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000]  You did not take this very well at all,
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  but they're also deeply in denial.
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  Like, there was somebody who obviously fancies himself
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  as a technical person, you know,
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.000]  but somebody was trying to say that the Samsung S8
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  has the same feature, and it's better implemented.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000]  The Samsung...
[02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  I mean, whatever you want to say about the Samsung Galaxy S8
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  as a camera compared to the regular iPhone 7,
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  maybe it's as good.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000]  I know that...
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  I'm sure it has a very good camera.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  I own a Google Pixel upstairs.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  The Google Pixel has an excellent camera.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  I don't...
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  I honestly don't know if it's better or worse
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  than my iPhone 7.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  I'm familiar with the iPhone 7,
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  but I can see that they're technically
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  on par with each other, you know.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  Somebody cited the Pixel thing in that stupid DxOMark
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  that ranked the Pixel as having the highest-rated sensor
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  in their history.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  That DxOMark thing is bullshit.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  It's total bullshit.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  The people pay to be in it.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000]  The reason that they rated the Pixel
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000]  before it even came out
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  was because Google paid them to do it.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  It's a bullshit metric,
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  and even if you believe the metric,
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000]  it's only rating the sensor of the camera.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  It's not even telling you
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  whether it takes good pictures or not.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000]  It's saying it has the best sensor,
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  but it's obviously...
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  It worked to Google's advantage
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000]  where people who want to believe it
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  took it as meaning that some independent firm
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000]  has certified that the Google Pixel
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  has the best camera on any phone.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  It doesn't.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  The iPhone 7 Plus has the best camera on any phone,
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  and I say this as somebody whose daily phone,
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  the phone I own, is an iPhone 7, not the 7 Plus,
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000]  because I like the size better.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000]  I love the 7 Plus so much.
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  But it hurts my heart.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  The 7 Plus is so much better as a camera.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  It's ridiculous.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  It's absolutely ridiculous,
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  and portrait mode is amazing,
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  and it has gotten so much better
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  since it came out last year.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  The edge detection is so much better.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000]  But the Galaxy S8 camera,
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  they do have a...
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  They call it like fake bokeh mode or something,
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000]  and it has something that tries to do it,
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  but it's still just a one-lens camera,
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000]  and it's doing it all with edge detection,
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  and it's all software,
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  whereas there's no optical aspect to it
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  like there is with the iPhone.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  Yeah, his point he makes is,
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000]  I mean, I think he...
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  I actually think that he isn't betraying
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  what he said in the past.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  I think he did not like...
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  It's clear the evolution of Android
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  was not the direction he thought it would go,
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  and his statement in the Facebook post
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  in reply to people are like,
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  well, you know, when you don't control the hardware,
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  and you've got to make compromises in all the software,
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  you can't do great things like this.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  Google was way ahead, and they really were.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  Google was way ahead.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  Project Tango is really interesting
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  where it has a depth camera,
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  in addition to a regular camera,
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  and I wouldn't be surprised if Apple adds
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  actually a literally separate depth-finding lens or thing.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  It's kind of...
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  Well, it's not a lens, like a laser bouncing thing,
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  but anyway, it makes a lot of sense to do that
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  for if you're trying to do AR
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  and other kinds of depth-based things.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  Two lenses is good, and this is even better.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  So anyway, Google has been more advanced
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  in computational photography.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  They acquired...
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  Sorry, they hired away the father of computation
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  from Stanford, you know, went to work there.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  I tried to interview him for an article.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  He said, yeah, let me talk to PR,
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  and there's dead silence.
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  After that, wasn't able to get him into a piece
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  they did for Fast Company last year
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  about the future of computational photography,
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  and without being able to enforce
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  and push stuff down low enough,
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000]  they can't do the stuff Apple can,
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  and he admits it, and I think that's obviously...
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  I don't know why he left the team
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.000]  or what happened there,
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  but it's clearly a point of frustration for him,
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  and he's not wrong about the iPhone 7 Plus.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  I own one.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  I bought it specifically for photography,
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  and I carry it like...
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  I have a nice mirrorless camera I really like,
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  and I pick up the iPhone 7 Plus all the time.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  Now, when we had double rainbows the other day,
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  we had a crazy 180-degree double rainbow weird weather thing.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  I grabbed my nice camera and a zoom lens
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  and went out and shot all kinds of shots,
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  and when I was doing some other photography
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  in a nature area near here,
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  I brought my nicer camera with the lens,
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  but the iPhone 7 Plus is the most fantastic cell phone camera you can get.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  I have the...
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  I think I mentioned this with Rene in a recent episode,
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  but I still have the red...
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  When the red iPhones came out mid-year or mid-cycle,
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  Apple gave me a review unit, very nice to them.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  I mean, I don't know what to do.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  I mean, it's exactly the phone I reviewed six months earlier,
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  except now it's red, you know, but that's nice.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  So I still have it.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  That's the phone I've been using,
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  using the iOS betas on all summer.
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  And because I'm running the betas on it,
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  I took it...
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  We had a family wedding down in South Carolina,
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  and we were there for a week.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  We had a family that rented a beach house,
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  and it was very nice,
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  and we went right near Charleston,
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  which I'd never been to Charleston before.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  Beautiful city. Oh, my God.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  If you ever have a chance to go to Charleston, South Carolina,
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  it's truly, truly beautiful.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  And it's really interesting to me as a Philadelphian
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  to see a city with roots from the exact same era,
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  pre-colonial, you know, colonial times,
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  and to see certain things that are the same
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  and certain things that are so different
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  between Philadelphia and Charleston.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  But anyway, took my Fuji X100S,
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  which is, if you're not a camera nerd, it's not an SLR.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  It doesn't even have detachable lenses.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  It has one lens, a 35-millimeter equivalent lens,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  but a really, really nice mirrorless camera.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  I really love it.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000]  It's a couple years out of date.
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:16.000]  I think there's two successors already.
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  But it really is a great camera.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  It takes great video and really nice stills.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  And I took my regular iPhone,
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  and I also took the iPhone 7 Plus
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  just because I was testing iOS betas at the time.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  So I took a portrait of Jonas in Charleston.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000]  It was just real nice light.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  I took a portrait of my son using the iPhone 7 Plus
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  and then took one with the X100S
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  from the exact same spot.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  And I do have to say,
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  the X100S shot definitely looks better.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  I could see it.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000]  It is.
[02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  There's no shame in that.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  It's a dedicated camera that cost me like $1,100.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  But boy, oh boy, does the portrait mode get close.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  And boy, oh boy, does the portrait mode take a picture
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  that looks so much better than anything you can get
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  with the regular iPhone 7.
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  And holy cow, after WWDC,
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  when I went through the presentations
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  and looked at what they were demoing
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.000]  or showing in presentations
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:19.000]  and then read stuff about developers who were testing that,
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  that is going to be so amazing with the depth API added.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  They're showing, I mean,
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  I think it's seven different distinct layers of depth
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  that, if I'm remembering right,
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  at least in the current version.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  And just the idea of you'll be able to have
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  black and white background, color foreground,
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  drop people into things, automatically do silhouetting,
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  which is useful for all kinds of purposes.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  The AR integration relies on depth mapping.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  That's a whole other thing.
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  But I think the two camera phone,
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  I mean, I'm curious if the premium phone
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  is going to have two cameras,
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  because it would be weird if it didn't, right?
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  But it won't.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  I think it does.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  I think the premium phone will certainly will.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  It does?
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  My big question has to,
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000]  I don't think the rumor mill has answered it,
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  is are all of the new ones going to have dual cameras?
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  Like will the-
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  All the phones?
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  Right.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  I don't know.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.000]  They should.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  It's not very expensive to add a second camera at this point.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  I mean, they're building the camera system already.
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  It's more about space.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  Yeah, and so far in the plus era,
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  meaning starting with the iPhone 6,
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  the plus model has had a better camera
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  than the non-plus model.
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  But every single year, the next year,
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  the regular model gets whatever the one had before,
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  where the first one was optical image stabilization.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  And I think the iPhone 6S-
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  The iPhone 6S got it.
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000]  That's right.
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  But it was optical image stabilization
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000]  that only worked for stills and not video.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  But then the iPhone, when the 6S got it,
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000]  the 6S Plus got optical image stabilization
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  that works for video too.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  And then last year, now the iPhone 7
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  has optical image stabilization that works with video.
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000]  And that is one of the most striking things too,
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000]  where I did notice that,
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:59.000]  where optical image stabilization on video on these phones
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  is so unbelievably good.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000]  And so, for example, my X100S doesn't have it.
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000]  And so the video,
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  in terms of the still quality of the frames of video,
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  it's unbelievably beautiful.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000]  But because it doesn't have optical image stabilization,
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000]  or not optical image, yeah, optical image stabilization.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000]  The video I shoot on my phone looks way better
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:27.000]  for just typical taking stuff on vacation, walking around.
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  It's not on a tripod.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000]  It's handheld.
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  The smoothness of that makes it so much more,
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  it looks, honestly,
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  if you'd have shown it to somebody 10 years ago,
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000]  it looks like professional video.
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  Like, there's no way,
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  how could an amateur shoot video
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  that we were walking down a sidewalk and it's not shaking?
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  How could you get it?
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  Yeah, it was weird.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  I was shooting something the other day
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  and it was bizarre to me.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  I thought something was wrong with the camera
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.000]  because it was so smooth.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000]  I was like, oh yeah, yeah, it's OAS.
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  I was actually doing the right thing,
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:56.000]  but it was so smooth,
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000]  it felt like it wasn't tracking me correctly.
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  And it was just doing it the right thing.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000]  I honestly think it's a bigger difference
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000]  for consumer video
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  than the move from standard def to high def,
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000]  at least in terms, if you compare it
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000]  to the last years of standard def, the quality.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000]  Like, when Jonas was born, Jonas is 13,
[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  so we got a video camera right before he was born,
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.000]  so it was like the best mini DV was the tape technology.
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000]  I got the best mini DV that I could,
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  it was within my budget from Panasonic.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  So the first couple years of his life,
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:33.000]  our video of him is all shot on a standard def.
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  And you could see it,
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  and the frame is four to three,
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000]  it's not 16 to nine.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  But the quality's not that bad.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000]  It really doesn't look so bad.
[02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000]  Like, when we watch those old movies now,
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  the aspect ratio stands out more than the image quality.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000]  I mean, the image quality's there,
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  you can see it,
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  but I think that the biggest difference
[02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000]  in consumer video is optical image stabilization
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  because the video I shoot on my phone now,
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000]  I'm just shocked sometimes at how smooth it is.
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000]  One thing, you know where I got on this rant,
[02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  was I noticed it,
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  was the Clips app,
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  I don't wanna go on a long rant here,
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000]  I know we gotta wrap up,
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000]  but Apple's Clips app doesn't,
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000]  when you shoot video in Clips,
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  it doesn't have optical image stabilization.
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  And it stuck out to me like a sore thumb
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  when I was making just a little clip
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  of a family birthday,
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  of a second birthday of like a niece or a nephew,
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  I forget whose birthday it was,
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000]  earlier this summer,
[02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  I shot a bunch of clips with it,
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000]  and then when I watched it,
[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  I was like,
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000]  this looks like shit compared to my usual videos.
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000]  And then I realized that when you shoot a clip in Clips,
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  and I wrote to Apple and confirmed it,
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  it doesn't use optical image stabilization.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  I don't know why.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  Oh, that might be it.
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000]  Well, it's weird,
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  because you think it'd be pulling it out of the,
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000]  I don't know.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  What is it called?
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000]  The image, the ISO?
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  No, what is it?
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000]  The thing that does the image processing on the...
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  I don't know if it's a battery thing or what,
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000]  but you know, huh, it's interesting,
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000]  but it really sticks out.
[02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.000]  And so if you do this,
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  if you just like,
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000]  just in your house,
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000]  just like shoot,
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000]  use the camera app,
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000]  take a video of yourself walking down a hallway,
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:07.000]  and then go back to the beginning,
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000]  go to the Clips app,
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000]  and reproduce the shot,
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  and try to hold the camera still,
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000]  and then put the two clips side by side and watch,
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  and I guarantee you,
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000]  you will see the difference.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000]  Mm-hmm.
[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000]  Anyway.
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000]  Anyway, my big hope,
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  my single biggest hope for the iPhone this year,
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000]  and I don't think the rumors have answered it.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  If they are,
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  somebody let me know,
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  but I don't think we know yet
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  whether the iPhone 7S,
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  if that's what they're gonna call it,
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  but the new 4.7-inch new iPhone,
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.000]  it has dual cameras or not,
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  and I certainly hope it does
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  because it's a huge, huge...
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  It's just a game changer.
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  It's so great,
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  and they've barely taught...
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  I mean, what Apple and third parties can do with it is,
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  really, we've barely seen anything.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  Computational photography, for me,
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  this is why I wrote the piece for Fast Company last year.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  It's the most exciting thing nobody talks about
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  because it requires too much background
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  to understand what the future might bring,
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  so you have to see examples of real things happening
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  and then be able to do it yourself.
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  And portrait mode is a taste of that,
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  but there's so many things you can do
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  because it gives you the ability,
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  especially with two cameras
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  that have different characteristics,
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  you essentially can combine those
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  in a way that gives you almost like more F stops.
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  You can de-blur things
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  because you have two images.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000]  You can actually do interpolated de-blur.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  There's like a million things that are super cool,
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  and we've seen one of them.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  We've seen HDR, which dates back years.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  That's a form of computational photography,
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  and now we're seeing this portrait mode,
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  and there's like 50 other cool things
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  that are gonna come that will be exciting
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  as a photographer to use
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  as an additional tool in your arsenal.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  You know what I've noticed, too?
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  I don't know if you have.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000]  I noticed this summer,
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000]  and I guess in shocking summers
[02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  when I'm outside and not in my little cave,
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  but I noticed with some shots
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  we were at Disney World last month,
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  I noticed that I almost always now,
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  when you have HDR on it,
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  I have it set so that it still saves two versions
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  of the photo, one with and one without,
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  and the reason that preference exists
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  is that when the iPhone first got HDR,
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  sometimes it made the photo better,
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  and sometimes it definitely didn't.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000]  Sometimes there'd be like a weird double exposure
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  type thing, or something would just look wrong
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  in the HDR version.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  I'm on the cusp of just turning that preference off
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  because whenever it's on,
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  I always prefer HDR now.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  I can't find one in my last several hundred shots
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  where I prefer the non-HDR version.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  Yeah, if it takes an HDR shot,
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  there's a reason for it,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  and then an HDR one is blown out
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  or something else is wrong.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  And they've gotten better, though.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  They've gotten better at avoiding it,
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  and it's the sort of incremental improvement
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  that nobody really sings the praises off.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  So if you're there on the HDR team
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  at Apple's photo engineering team.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  We noticed.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  We noticed, and I thank you for your blood, sweat, and tears.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  No, it's true. I should turn that off, too.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  I'm taking all these extra shots for no good reason.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  Yeah, I've got all these extra shots,
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  and I realize now that I,
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  but I used to think, well, I,
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000]  but I, you know, look at this one.
[02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  This one looks weird with HDR,
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  and now I don't see that anymore.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  The funny thing is that the one thing
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  that I had to deal with recently,
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  I was trying to take a very long,
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  I wanted to take pictures of me printing a time lapse,
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  and I looked into Apple's options.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  You know, Apple's time lapse has this thing.
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  It like dynamically adjusts,
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  so it's always about the same length when you're done.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  It just starts dropping frames and kind of reworks it.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  So I used a, what's it called?
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  Frame, not Framoleum.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  It's from our friends at Studio Neat, Framographer,
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  which is, I think, is an old app.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  They still sell it, and it actually was incredible.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  The interface seems a little outdated,
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  so I think it may be made for an earlier iOS version,
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  and it's great.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  So I was able to do that with,
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  I used it with the iPhone 7 Plus to get a better image,
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000]  and at one point recorded like seven hours, I think,
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000]  or five hours, and wound up with a few minutes,
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  and it just was fantastic to get a,
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  but I wanted it spaced a certain interval apart,
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000]  as opposed to having it dynamically shrunk to a certain,
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  to fit to a certain total length.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  Anyway, I imagine there was some laughter within Cupertino
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  when this Vic N' Dozier post passed around.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000]  Oh, it's okay, it's okay to have some schadenfreude,
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  but I think, I mean, it's great that he came to see
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  what the truth was, right?
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  Well, between him and now with Steven Stanofsky
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000]  being probably one of the top three or four iPad proponents
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  in the world.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  Oh my God, so funny.
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  Outside Apple, at least.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  I mean, he's like right behind Federico Vidicci.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  I mean, that's how staunchly Steven Stanofsky,
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  who, if you don't know the name, was formerly at Microsoft
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000]  and was sort of the brains behind the whole surface tablet
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  thing, you know, and left a couple years ago.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  Now he's a huge, huge iPad proponent.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  And a good writer on the subject as well.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  But anyway, that's it for me.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  We're gonna run out of tape here on the tape machine.
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  That's right, no, the tape machine started to slap.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  Either that or we'll flip it around and go to side two.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.000]  Anyway, Glenn, I thank you for your time.
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  It's a pleasure.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000]  I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of this book.
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  Glog.glennf.com is the main headquarters
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  for your sprawling empire of web presences.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  And then on Twitter, you are Glenn F. G-L-E-N-N-F.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  He's paid for the extra N.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  Come for my fights with Eric Trump.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  Stay for the tweets about letterpress printing
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000]  and books from the 1800s.
[02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  Personally, I don't know about you, personally,
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  but almost every single name where there's alternate spellings,
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  I prefer the one with the extra letter.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  I like my Glens with two Ns.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  I like my Saras with an H, and I like my Johns with an H.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  Now maybe I'm biased on the John issue,
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  but I like a Sarah with an H.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  If you're out there and you're an S-A-R-A,
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  I still think it's a lovely name, but I like the extra letter.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  And I'll tell you what, I don't like a Glenn with only one N.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  Untrustworthy.
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  I know, those people.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  I know they have problems with them.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  Shifty, in my opinion, in my experience.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  I would never buy a car from a Glenn with one N.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  I'd walk right out of the dealer.
