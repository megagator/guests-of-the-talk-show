[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  I'm really great. I'm in a great mood.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  You're kidding.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.500]  I'm in a particularly good mood.
[00:27.500 --> 00:29.500]  I'm so glad.
[00:29.500 --> 00:31.000]  You're not worried?
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  You're talking about the snowpocalypse, right?
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  Yeah, right. The jonastrophe.
[00:36.000 --> 00:45.000]  Yeah. What do they call it? Winterstorm Jonas, which is obviously a big point of conversation here at the Gruber household.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  Jonas is a bit impressed. He's excited. He's like a hashtag on Twitter now.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.500]  So he's very excited about that.
[00:54.500 --> 00:56.000]  Your son is trending.
[00:56.000 --> 01:13.000]  But he is disappointed and slightly embarrassed by the fact that this is a big storm that is coming on a Friday night, which is the worst possible time for a storm to hit in terms of maybe getting a day off of school.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.500]  It could not possibly be the worst time.
[01:18.500 --> 01:31.500]  There was no conversation whatsoever about canceling school today in advance of the snowstorm because they're so certain that it's not going to come until this evening that there was no need to cancel school in advance.
[01:31.500 --> 01:34.500]  See, at this point, science is working against children.
[01:34.500 --> 01:42.500]  Because when we were younger, we did not have this kind of technology to know. We had a rough idea of what kind of thing would happen in a given week.
[01:42.500 --> 01:52.500]  And also, I don't think there was as much concern for makeup days. I feel like when I was a kid, you'd only get into the makeup days if you had 5 or 10 snow days.
[01:52.500 --> 01:55.500]  And today, everything runs on such a tight schedule.
[01:55.500 --> 02:00.500]  Maybe they'd go back. After a bunch of snow days, they'd assign one of the school secretaries,
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.500]  Hey, go back and count just how many days we've had school.
[02:03.500 --> 02:05.500]  You know what? We should probably write that down.
[02:05.500 --> 02:09.500]  Louise, can you go check that out for us?
[02:09.500 --> 02:13.500]  No, I'm excited. Here's why I'm not excited, but I'm excited about this snow.
[02:13.500 --> 02:23.500]  But I'm happy. I'm in a good mood because I woke up terribly sick on Wednesday and just felt almost dead.
[02:23.500 --> 02:26.500]  And then I felt a little better but still definitely sick yesterday.
[02:26.500 --> 02:34.500]  And today is the day where I feel... I still feel like I'm not good, but I'm on the upswing.
[02:34.500 --> 02:41.500]  To me, it's the best. It's better than being at 100% health is that day after you've had a bug for a couple of days where you feel like,
[02:41.500 --> 02:44.500]  Hey, I woke up feeling good today.
[02:44.500 --> 02:48.500]  Especially when you've had a long cold.
[02:48.500 --> 02:53.500]  And maybe you're just starting to get into the coughing phase or something, that kind of late end.
[02:53.500 --> 02:56.500]  But the day you stop getting worse is such a good day.
[02:56.500 --> 02:59.500]  The first day, we were like, Oh God, I might survive this.
[02:59.500 --> 03:03.500]  You told me about that yesterday, and I have to say you sound way better than I expected.
[03:03.500 --> 03:09.500]  But I was thinking, you're sick. Marco's sick. Dan's had some kind of crazy stomach bug.
[03:09.500 --> 03:12.500]  I was kind of just sitting there, you know when you're waking up and you get paranoid?
[03:12.500 --> 03:16.500]  I was waking up and I was just thinking about how many people I know are sick right now.
[03:16.500 --> 03:20.500]  Is this a big East Coast thing? They say there's this killer flu that is going around the East Coast.
[03:20.500 --> 03:24.500]  Well, I want to ask you about this. I want to get your medical advice, honestly.
[03:24.500 --> 03:25.500]  Yeah, I'd love to help.
[03:25.500 --> 03:34.500]  Is that I think I had the flu. And Amy tells me, no way did you have the flu because nobody shakes the flu off in 48 hours.
[03:34.500 --> 03:36.500]  You obviously didn't have the flu. You had a cold.
[03:36.500 --> 03:41.500]  But I know what a cold is like. And for me, a cold is entirely in my head and my throat.
[03:41.500 --> 03:46.500]  It is in my nose. It's in my forehead. Sometimes it's like pressure in my eyes.
[03:46.500 --> 03:50.500]  And it's always in my throat. This was a whole body thing. This is what happened.
[03:50.500 --> 03:59.500]  Tuesday night, I felt perfect. I felt 100 percent healthy. Went to bed, woke up Wednesday morning and I felt horrible.
[03:59.500 --> 04:03.500]  I mean, just I was like, I think I'm sick or something.
[04:03.500 --> 04:09.500]  And my whole body felt like maybe I had signed up for the gym the day before and decided I would do everything.
[04:09.500 --> 04:13.500]  Oh, you had the overall like body soreness and heaviness.
[04:13.500 --> 04:24.500]  Oh, without. I mean, real, real. I mean, like my legs hurt. I felt like I was, you know, maybe I'd put on 100 pounds and my legs weren't suited to carry this much weight up and down the stairs.
[04:24.500 --> 04:35.500]  My arms hurt. Everything that was, you know, and muscle ache, you know, like I had gone to the gym, you know, and worked out after never having lifted weights in my life.
[04:35.500 --> 04:44.500]  And overall, every muscle in my body hurt. Headache. Clearly, I felt like I had a fever.
[04:44.500 --> 04:52.500]  All these things that to me are not a cold. Like, that's the flu. I mean, what are the other options? I mean, what do they call them?
[04:52.500 --> 04:58.500]  Maybe you can do a differential diagnosis. Yeah. No, it's funny you say that. Like, for me, I totally agree.
[04:58.500 --> 05:09.500]  Like, if something starts, for me, it always starts with an uh-oh. And that uh-oh. If I get a cold, it's usually like, oh, my throat doesn't hurt exactly, but my throat feels weird.
[05:09.500 --> 05:16.500]  That's the first thing. It's like swallowing. It doesn't hurt exactly, but I notice swallowing. That's the first uh-oh. Red flag.
[05:16.500 --> 05:21.500]  But what you're describing, I had something really similar maybe a month and a half ago, maybe a little longer.
[05:21.500 --> 05:30.500]  And I woke up and I was like, oh, I'm getting the flu. I'm definitely getting the flu. And this was on maybe like a Saturday or something, or Friday.
[05:30.500 --> 05:43.500]  Anyway, and then the thing was, it kind of presented as being flu-like. I didn't have any of the tummy stuff, but I did feel really heavy, really tired.
[05:43.500 --> 05:49.500]  And then it turned into what felt like, within a day, it felt like I was getting over a cold within a day.
[05:49.500 --> 05:52.500]  So I wonder if there's some kind of a new hybrid cold flu that might be out there.
[05:52.500 --> 05:56.500]  Yeah, I think that sometimes you can get lucky and get a mild case of the flu.
[05:56.500 --> 06:03.500]  Like, I realize that if you really get whacked right square, you know, right in the bull's-eye by the flu, that you're down for like two weeks.
[06:03.500 --> 06:08.500]  And that's terrible. It's been years since I've had something like this, but this is clearly not a cold.
[06:08.500 --> 06:09.500]  Do you really understand the difference?
[06:09.500 --> 06:10.500]  No, not really.
[06:10.500 --> 06:15.500]  I don't either. I say that, or you say something, so when you self-diagnose, I love how you self-diagnose.
[06:15.500 --> 06:22.500]  And you go like, oh, man, I think I'm getting a little cold. Or you go like, oh, man, I'm coming down with the flu.
[06:22.500 --> 06:28.500]  Or you go like, eh, I probably got a 24-hour bug. I don't know what any of that actually means, but I'll do it with my daughter, too.
[06:28.500 --> 06:34.500]  Because with my daughter, I'm the house shaman. Like, I'm the one who tries to predict how much this is going to destroy.
[06:34.500 --> 06:38.500]  Because, you know, as soon as the kid gets sick, it's game over. Everybody will get sick, and it's going to be the worst.
[06:38.500 --> 06:45.500]  And so I'll go like, I'll come in with my rattles and my headdress and my beads, and I'll be like, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[06:45.500 --> 06:50.500]  Eleanor will be fine by Sunday afternoon. And I'll make a pronouncement.
[06:50.500 --> 06:55.500]  It's rarely right, but then sometimes it is just weird. I feel like colds and flus are changing.
[06:55.500 --> 07:00.500]  I feel like it used to be you knew how long you were going to get sick. I think something has mutated and is changing.
[07:00.500 --> 07:05.500]  It might be the water. It could be meats. But I think stuff is changing from when I was a kid.
[07:05.500 --> 07:13.500]  I've always felt like it's the difference between the two things. It's, you know, it's all nebulous to me.
[07:13.500 --> 07:18.500]  It's a lot of the symptoms overlap. But I did, I Googled it again. And, you know, here I am, I'm pretty old.
[07:18.500 --> 07:20.500]  Well, at least once you're getting scientific about it.
[07:20.500 --> 07:24.500]  Yeah, I Googled it. I mean, there's no better way to get expert medical advice.
[07:24.500 --> 07:31.500]  But there's like a checklist on the WebMD, and they're like a cold, you know, often comes on slowly.
[07:31.500 --> 07:35.500]  You know, like you said, you get that heads up. You have that day where you're like, Oh, my God,
[07:35.500 --> 07:38.500]  I feel like there's a 50% chance I'm going to be sick as shit.
[07:38.500 --> 07:44.500]  You feel like you're getting like 20%. I mean, you're getting like 8% worse every hour, like fairly consistently.
[07:44.500 --> 07:47.500]  Do you know what? I'll tell you what a big telltale sign of a cold for me is.
[07:47.500 --> 07:55.500]  A big telltale sign, like the 24 hour advance notice. Like, here I am, wake up, feel fine, no suspicions, no warning flags, whatever.
[07:55.500 --> 07:59.500]  I make some coffee. I'm reading some news, seeing what happened overnight.
[07:59.500 --> 08:05.500]  And then I take a first sip of coffee and it tastes like shit, like terrible. Like, how can anybody drink this?
[08:05.500 --> 08:09.500]  And then I think that I and then I quickly run through. Did I did I make it wrong?
[08:09.500 --> 08:13.500]  Did I not put enough beans in? And then I think, Oh, shit, I'm good.
[08:13.500 --> 08:16.500]  Oh, you know what it is, buddy. You know what it is. I'm getting sick.
[08:16.500 --> 08:19.500]  You're exactly you're ignoring it. You're you're trying to throw yourself off the scent.
[08:19.500 --> 08:24.500]  But that's probably a scientist. We can look at this and say that's probably a little bit about scent.
[08:24.500 --> 08:28.500]  It's got to have to do with your sense of smell. It might have to do with like your throat not feeling so good.
[08:28.500 --> 08:31.500]  But your body is telling you Oh, you're gonna get sick, buddy. Yeah.
[08:31.500 --> 08:41.500]  And it's it's like something on my tongue, you know, and then the other thing in advance is that something acidic like orange juice will will start stinging the back of my throat.
[08:41.500 --> 08:48.500]  Like I don't have a sore throat yet. But like something acidic like orange juice, it doesn't go down doesn't it isn't pleasurable as I swallow.
[08:48.500 --> 08:55.500]  And that's to me is like, ooh, the next day. See, and they say that's a cold that a cold, you know, you have advanced warning,
[08:55.500 --> 09:01.500]  and that a cold seldom has a fever seldom has a headache.
[09:01.500 --> 09:12.500]  I had a terrible fever, I would I didn't take a measurement of it. I don't have a thermometer, I would estimate my fever on on Wednesday, and then overnight going into tomorrow, I would estimate it around 107.
[09:12.500 --> 09:25.500]  Hmm. That's pretty high. Well, I tell you what I but I think the reason I felt started feeling better yesterday. I think I sweated it out. I think I sweated this flu out of my body because I'll tell you what I woke up.
[09:25.500 --> 09:30.500]  I woke up yesterday morning, and it was like I was like a grease stain.
[09:30.500 --> 09:42.500]  Every single thing you're mentioning, I don't know if there's any basis in science or medicine for what you're describing, but I've thought all of those things when I was a little kid, if you had a fever, you had to stay in bed until you quote unquote, sweated it out. Is that a thing?
[09:42.500 --> 09:48.500]  I think it is. I don't believe I and I know it's different with small children with small children, you worry.
[09:48.500 --> 10:05.500]  Oh, thank you. It's like 114. Oh, yeah, they're aching and you want to take care of that because I could, you know, that's serious business. But I think as a as an adult, you don't take I don't take anything to take, you know, take the fever down or whatever. I feel like if your body wants to have a fever, then let it go. You know, you'll sweat this out.
[10:05.500 --> 10:22.500]  Let me ask you this. I think I don't speak for you. But I feel like anyone who has kids can agree that it's children that cause illness because they're little disgusting sponges who touch everything they eat other kids boogers on a dare and and then they rub around on the playground and then they come home and they bring that into your home.
[10:22.500 --> 10:31.500]  Do you have a sense? Let me ask you this is a factual question. Do you know what your school's rule is for when you should or should not send your kid to school?
[10:31.500 --> 10:49.500]  That's an excellent question. I don't I think Amy would probably know a little bit more but it is in the modern age. And you know, I mean, this goes back decades. I think when you and I were kids were at the pivot point of this.
[10:49.500 --> 11:01.500]  Clearly before our time, there was a stay at home parent and a lot of households, usually obviously the mother. And you know, in today's world, there are, you know, there's not so many stay at home parents.
[11:01.500 --> 11:12.500]  And also, I mean, like I can tell you are my my daughter is in, you know, enrichment and aftercare until usually three or four every day, but there are kids who are there till dark.
[11:12.500 --> 11:34.500]  There's six like the parents need those both parents are working. There is no way to take care of that kid unless someone doesn't get paid. Right. And so I actually I don't know the rules, but I know that a lot of kids go when they probably shouldn't and probably when the parents kind of wish that they could leave them home, but that it is such an enormous thing to untangle from to if you don't send the kid to school.
[11:34.500 --> 11:51.500]  What do you do and you know, and a lot of times it pops up, it only pops up in the morning, you know, when you wake up and it's, you know, you might have meetings, you have stuff. So I am super sympathetic to that. I don't know. And I know that the school's rules for this is not very well, I'll tell you what ours are.
[11:51.500 --> 12:20.500]  So first of all, to your point, I think the pendulum has swung. I think that I think that there was a time, you know, in the post, you know, Benjamin Spock era where we went to toughen up our kids and not turn and turn them into sissies and dancers. And so you send them to school, you got to send them to school, you got to go to school, no matter how sick you are. And then I think I feel like from from for me in the last, I want to say even when I had a job in the 90s, they made it very clear to people, you know, don't come to work if you're sick, because you'll make other people sick. We never used to talk about that used to just be you had to be home because you were ill.
[12:20.500 --> 12:41.500]  But then there was this sense of no, let's be more, you know, the pendulum swings that way. And you say like, Oh, no, let's not make other people sick. It's my understanding today. And I might get this wrong, but I believe this is correct. Because I don't like going to school and seeing a bunch of snot. Yeah, freaks me out. I hate those kids who are just walking down the hallway and coughing. I get all like Howard Hughes, I get all damn Benjamin when I see that. And so
[12:41.500 --> 12:53.500]  you know, and I hate to say it, and my kids a bit fastidious. So he is not this way. But there's a classic kid who just seems completely ignorant of snot coming out of the nose.
[12:53.500 --> 13:09.500]  He's just used to it. He doesn't mind it. You could see one, you know, the really the really the really classic pro level snot kid will have will have the crust around the rim, right? And then the still kind of moist droplet like pine tar falling. And then you know, might take years for that one to fall, but it's there.
[13:09.500 --> 13:34.500]  It almost looks like they're like, one of those like a stalactite. Well, you know, like, there's like, two kinds of aliens in Star Wars, there's the ones that look like totally, you know, like some kind of outlandish design. And then there's the ones that are like, mostly human, but have like a little thing different. And like, it looks like, you know, maybe you're an alien who has like a crusty rock formation coming out where your nose should be.
[13:34.500 --> 14:01.500]  Here's what I think this is what my wife said is, I think I might be getting this wrong, but I feel like what she told me was, you keep your kid home officially, if they have a fever, vomiting, and or diarrhea. Otherwise, they're good to go. Your kid could be like, literally have a vein open. And as long as they're not vomiting and inconveniencing people, you just reel them right in. Isn't that nuts? Can you imagine that?
[14:01.500 --> 14:19.500]  Honestly, I, whether it's official or not, it sounds, it seems to me like that is, practically speaking, the way it goes, like, and those are the things. The fever is the one where it's like a kid with a fever is so miserable. It's, they just
[14:19.500 --> 14:43.500]  because when you're little, you feel it so much more like, I hate having a fever, but I remember the fevers. I still remember the ear aches and fevers of my childhood title that still in my mind, I feel like I still remember thinking maybe short of my first migraine, like this is the most excruciating thing I will ever feel is like the feeling of being out of your body and yet incredibly connected to the pain in your body when you have a fever. And then also like having the same dream over and over.
[14:43.500 --> 14:59.500]  Yeah, yeah. Let's go to school. Let's do some geography today, John. I remember, the thing I remember about having a fever as a kid, it was how severe the chills were. And what a great name for the symptom that is. I mean, it's kind of obvious, but it sounds like a Stephen King novel.
[14:59.500 --> 15:13.500]  And when you're a kid having the chills, for me at least, I remember it vividly. There was nothing you could do. You could douse me in lighter fluid and light me on fire and it wouldn't warm me up, even though I had a fever.
[15:13.500 --> 15:22.500]  My torso and trunk would feel like they were in a walk-in freezer and my head might feel like it was in a microwave at the same time. And I could not stand anything touching my skin.
[15:22.500 --> 15:33.500]  Right. And you're like, I can't. The fuck is not helping me? Right. In the real life, I think it's only like 20 degrees here in Philadelphia today. It's 26. It's very familiar.
[15:33.500 --> 15:44.500]  You go out in weather like that and it's unpleasant, but eventually your skin starts to burn. There's some kind of way that your nerves sort of compensate for this and they're like, all right, we got to just real cold. We're going to even this out.
[15:44.500 --> 15:53.500]  When you have the chills, especially as a kid, like you said, it's so much more sensitive. The cold just never stops. It's the worst.
[15:53.500 --> 16:02.500]  Well, I haven't had time to Google this, so I'm just going to guess. But what is that? Something's happening. Something's telling you your body is way out of whack.
[16:02.500 --> 16:10.500]  And I think what a fever is doing is whatever it is that is causing the fever, it's trying to raise your body temperature to kill that thing. Is that what it is?
[16:10.500 --> 16:11.500]  Yeah, to sweat it out.
[16:11.500 --> 16:13.500]  To sweat it out. That's ultimately...
[16:13.500 --> 16:25.500]  That's what happened. I didn't fight the fever. And then last, not this night, not Thursday night going into today, but Wednesday night going into Thursday, I sweated it out. I woke up as a breathing grease stain.
[16:25.500 --> 16:35.500]  So Wednesday, so it's Friday as we record this, but let's say if you can remember in your state, around lunchtime Wednesday, what was your prognosis?
[16:35.500 --> 16:41.500]  Did you feel like, oh, this is going to be something I get over or this is going to be like a two-weaker or is this going to be, you know, what's this going to be?
[16:41.500 --> 16:52.500]  I never had, well, I shouldn't say never, knock on wood, but I haven't been sick for like more than a handful of days and years. I'm, you know, I have to say I'm fortunate to have overall very good health.
[16:52.500 --> 16:53.500]  You know how to sweat it out.
[16:53.500 --> 17:04.500]  Yeah. But I wouldn't have guessed that I would feel as good as I do today. I thought I was looking at a maybe like through the weekend type thing. Let me tell you this.
[17:04.500 --> 17:10.500]  What a pathetic thing as an adult. Like the high point of your week is you don't feel sick anymore.
[17:10.500 --> 17:12.500]  I love it. Let me tell you that.
[17:12.500 --> 17:16.500]  It's not like I got a free model or something or I got to go to Disney World.
[17:16.500 --> 17:17.500]  I don't feel as bad.
[17:17.500 --> 17:29.500]  Here's my Wednesday. My Wednesday is I had no idea I was getting sick. I woke up and actually I should say when I woke up, I didn't really even think that I was sick. I just felt sore.
[17:29.500 --> 17:39.500]  And I thought, you know, that boy, I'm really in bad shape because I, you know, run some errands or, you know, like Monday and Tuesday, done some, you know, walked a couple miles and my legs felt so sore.
[17:39.500 --> 17:48.500]  I was like, that is pathetic that my legs feel so sore after just what just normal urban walking.
[17:48.500 --> 17:55.500]  And then I started like thinking a little bit more about how I felt. And I was like, you know what? I'm sick. And I'm like, oh, I'm hot. And it's like the heat is not on high.
[17:55.500 --> 18:00.500]  I've got a fever. And then I realized I was just parched with thirst. And I was like, this isn't good.
[18:00.500 --> 18:05.500]  And I realized it just dawned on me very slowly, like I've got the flu or something.
[18:05.500 --> 18:11.500]  And I thought I'm parched with thirst. I cannot. I just need something cold to drink.
[18:11.500 --> 18:20.500]  But I really want it had to be bubbly. I had needed fizzy water because the idea of drinking still water was absolutely disgusting to me.
[18:20.500 --> 18:29.500]  It just felt like it would. I normally don't like to drink still water. But at this moment, once you really get into fizzy water, there's something slightly revolting about room temperature flat water.
[18:29.500 --> 18:37.500]  And it's exaggerated when I'm sick. In the same way that coffee doesn't taste good when I'm sick, only something fizzy tastes good.
[18:37.500 --> 18:42.500]  It's the way my tongue feels. I need the bubbles to kind of burn the sick off the tongue or something.
[18:42.500 --> 18:51.500]  So I go downstairs and all of my SodaStream bottles are empty. Now that's my own fault because I'm the only one in the house who drinks this stuff.
[18:51.500 --> 18:59.500]  It's not like I can't blame anybody else because nobody else drinks it. So I go to fill one up and I put it in the penguin and I start pumping it.
[18:59.500 --> 19:05.500]  And it makes that sick sound when the canister is empty. So the CO2 canister is empty.
[19:05.500 --> 19:14.500]  Now, months ago, I had switched from keeping the spare canisters under the sink to keeping them down on our first floor, which is sort of a basement garage level.
[19:14.500 --> 19:22.500]  There's no living area down there, but it's not really a basement because it's sort of street level, but it's ground level and we have like a storeroom down there.
[19:22.500 --> 19:31.500]  I keep them there as a courtesy to Amy to not take up space under the sink with my own fizzy water thing that I only have to replace every couple weeks.
[19:31.500 --> 19:37.500]  So I go downstairs and I'm barefoot, but it's only like 20 degrees outside and it's like a tile floor.
[19:37.500 --> 19:48.500]  And it's just so cold. I couldn't take it. So I'm down on the first floor and it's a stone... I don't know. I would say that the floor was around negative 30 or 40 degrees.
[19:48.500 --> 19:51.500]  That's pretty cold.
[19:51.500 --> 19:52.500]  And I go back to where I keep...
[19:52.500 --> 19:55.500]  That's one of the properties. Is it like a concrete? Kind of just like cement?
[19:55.500 --> 19:57.500]  It's not concrete. It's tile.
[19:57.500 --> 20:02.500]  Oh, tile's even worse. I think tile will typically be 40 to 60 degrees colder than whatever room it's in.
[20:02.500 --> 20:04.500]  That's why you got to put water in your tub.
[20:04.500 --> 20:09.500]  I go to the back room where they are and I reach... I got to get down on the floor to find these things.
[20:09.500 --> 20:13.500]  And all three of the ones I have there, they're all empty already.
[20:13.500 --> 20:14.500]  Oh, no.
[20:14.500 --> 20:20.500]  So apparently at some point, my system is I have four... I keep four canisters of the CO2.
[20:20.500 --> 20:27.500]  And when I have three empties, I go to the Williams-Sonoma across town and swap the three old ones out for three new ones.
[20:27.500 --> 20:33.500]  And then my fourth is the one that... So apparently I screwed that up whenever I swapped the last one out.
[20:33.500 --> 20:37.500]  And so I'm left with nothing. I've got nothing and I'm already down there on this cold floor.
[20:37.500 --> 20:38.500]  Oh, no.
[20:38.500 --> 20:43.500]  And I've got no fizzy water. But I need something fizzy. So I had a beer.
[20:43.500 --> 20:46.500]  Oh, good for you. And that's got the performance characteristics.
[20:46.500 --> 20:47.500]  Yeah.
[20:47.500 --> 20:55.500]  Yeah, it's fizzy. And so the beer doesn't freeze when it's sitting... Was it outside or was it in a downstairs refrigerator?
[20:55.500 --> 20:56.500]  No, it was in a refrigerator.
[20:56.500 --> 20:58.500]  Your regular refrigerator, your primary refrigerator.
[20:58.500 --> 21:00.500]  Yeah, so I had a beer and I went back to bed. But I had to go up four flights of stairs.
[21:00.500 --> 21:04.500]  I think any doctor is going to tell you that's totally permissible because you're hydrating, you're helping to sweat it out.
[21:04.500 --> 21:08.500]  And you're getting the fizziness that would prevent you from being disgusted by flat water.
[21:08.500 --> 21:09.500]  Right.
[21:09.500 --> 21:12.500]  So then I woke back up around noon.
[21:12.500 --> 21:14.500]  To help you sleep at all?
[21:14.500 --> 21:21.500]  Yeah. Well, it was about an hour. Then I took a shower, which is the best I felt. Do you feel good when you're sick? Do you feel good when you take a shower?
[21:21.500 --> 21:23.500]  Six a day when I'm sick.
[21:23.500 --> 21:24.500]  It's the best, right?
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.500]  No doubt.
[21:25.500 --> 21:26.500]  It's like some...
[21:26.500 --> 21:29.500]  Drought schmout. I'm in there for six hours.
[21:29.500 --> 21:37.500]  No, it's literally the only thing. It'll give me relief or make me feel less awful for a little while.
[21:37.500 --> 21:41.500]  And then even for a little while after I get out, I'll continue to feel less awful. It's the only relief.
[21:41.500 --> 21:48.500]  And if you have a cold or stuffy in some way, the steam temporarily opens you up and stuff like that. It just feels good.
[21:48.500 --> 21:52.500]  So I started feeling better again. I got dressed, put some nice clean clothes on.
[21:52.500 --> 22:02.500]  And I was going to go out and buy... I couldn't make it far enough away. There's no way in my state I was going to make it far enough to get the CO2 cartridges.
[22:02.500 --> 22:11.500]  I was going to buy some Pellegrino or some Perrier or something just a block or two away.
[22:11.500 --> 22:16.500]  And so I went to the store and we didn't have any orange juice in the house either.
[22:16.500 --> 22:25.500]  So I went to the store and the only stuff I wanted to buy, I wanted to buy bottles of fizzy water, some orange juice, and I forget what else. Something else.
[22:25.500 --> 22:29.500]  Oh, those little cans of San Pellegrino, the orange ones. You know what I mean?
[22:29.500 --> 22:32.500]  Oh yeah, those are nice with the little wrapper on them?
[22:32.500 --> 22:37.500]  Yeah, exactly. With the little wrapper on them. It's sort of like a cross between fizzy water and soda.
[22:37.500 --> 22:43.500]  It was like the heaviest stuff you can possibly buy from a market.
[22:43.500 --> 22:51.500]  And I realized exactly who I felt like, what my posture looked like, and the pace that I was walking at.
[22:51.500 --> 22:57.500]  And my capabilities of carrying these groceries is I was C. Montgomery Burns.
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.500]  Hey, you look like a question mark.
[22:59.500 --> 23:07.500]  Yes. I didn't have the strength to keep my back straight.
[23:07.500 --> 23:13.500]  And you're a tall fella, so you bet that was pretty pronounced as you walk home with your little orange sodas.
[23:13.500 --> 23:16.500]  Oh, that's so sad.
[23:16.500 --> 23:18.500]  But here I am on Friday and I feel great.
[23:18.500 --> 23:23.500]  You're not, it looks like you got the Instacart there in Philadelphia.
[23:23.500 --> 23:24.500]  Yeah, see, I don't know how that works.
[23:24.500 --> 23:26.500]  Oh my God, I can't believe you're not using this.
[23:26.500 --> 23:30.500]  And would it get it to me within an hour?
[23:30.500 --> 23:34.500]  Well, in San Francisco, it's usually two hours, depending on how busy they are.
[23:34.500 --> 23:37.500]  It's two hours, but sometimes they have one hour availability.
[23:37.500 --> 23:39.500]  And they'll bring it right out to you.
[23:39.500 --> 23:45.500]  But yeah, it's just to me just the dread of even leaving the house in a situation like that.
[23:45.500 --> 23:47.500]  I just can't do it.
[23:47.500 --> 23:49.500]  I will add that Amy was busy at the time.
[23:49.500 --> 23:52.500]  I forget where she was, but she was out of the house.
[23:52.500 --> 23:56.500]  And so it wasn't as though Amy was there and wasn't willing to help me.
[23:56.500 --> 23:59.500]  I needed to help myself or remained completely parched.
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.500]  Just keep telling yourself that.
[24:01.500 --> 24:06.500]  I think she saw that I was getting sick and got the hell out.
[24:06.500 --> 24:09.500]  Anyway, you're right about the kids as the source.
[24:09.500 --> 24:13.500]  I feel like if we could, I mean, we don't want to kill all the children, but if we could...
[24:13.500 --> 24:14.500]  Not immediately, no.
[24:14.500 --> 24:19.500]  If we could isolate them, if we could just collect all the children of the world and, you know,
[24:19.500 --> 24:22.500]  lords of the fly them, like, let's send them to Australia.
[24:22.500 --> 24:23.500]  Because I think there's plenty of land down there.
[24:23.500 --> 24:27.500]  Put them all in Australia for maybe like an 18 month stretch.
[24:27.500 --> 24:30.500]  Some of them, obviously, will be killed by spiders.
[24:30.500 --> 24:33.500]  Well, I mean, that's inevitable down there.
[24:33.500 --> 24:35.500]  Is that a stereotype, Jon?
[24:35.500 --> 24:37.500]  That there's spiders in Australia?
[24:37.500 --> 24:39.500]  That there's giant deadly spiders?
[24:39.500 --> 24:46.500]  Yeah, I feel like, yeah, I would say Australia, most of Australia is pretty much like that room in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
[24:46.500 --> 24:49.500]  That's kind of what I imagine. Like, maybe a little better lit.
[24:49.500 --> 24:51.500]  But yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[24:51.500 --> 24:54.500]  Huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you got? You got probably howler monkeys.
[24:54.500 --> 24:57.500]  You got killer wombats.
[24:57.500 --> 25:01.500]  Like, it's just people with big knives. I don't know. It sounds like a pretty rough place.
[25:01.500 --> 25:04.500]  I'm just picking a place that's isolated, you know.
[25:04.500 --> 25:06.500]  But you, but yeah, wow.
[25:06.500 --> 25:11.500]  If we could just eliminate children for about a year and a half, isolate children for a year.
[25:11.500 --> 25:14.500]  Oh, somewhere, especially somewhere dry where they could sweat it out.
[25:14.500 --> 25:15.500]  Exactly.
[25:15.500 --> 25:18.500]  Whatever you're, like, you got a year to be sick, get it out of your system.
[25:18.500 --> 25:23.500]  We would eradicate every disease known to man, every contagious disease at least known to man,
[25:23.500 --> 25:27.500]  maybe other than STDs in the rest of the world.
[25:27.500 --> 25:29.500]  Let's hope they don't discover those.
[25:29.500 --> 25:30.500]  Right.
[25:30.500 --> 25:32.500]  Australia really makes you a little wild.
[25:32.500 --> 25:34.500]  Yeah, I, I...
[25:34.500 --> 25:37.500]  It popped into my head that STDs might not be helped by this.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.500]  But in terms of diseases like colds and flus...
[25:39.500 --> 25:40.500]  Let's hope not.
[25:40.500 --> 25:44.500]  In terms of diseases like colds and flus, if we could get rid of the children for about a year and a half,
[25:44.500 --> 25:46.500]  just to let these things, they would just die right out.
[25:46.500 --> 25:50.500]  If we just spent one day a week during that year scrubbing everything, you know.
[25:50.500 --> 25:53.500]  Well, here's the thing, and I'm not going to shut up about this.
[25:53.500 --> 25:55.500]  I think the hand-washing thing makes a huge difference.
[25:55.500 --> 25:58.500]  At my kid's preschool, they washed hands.
[25:58.500 --> 26:02.500]  You wash hands when you, like, grown-ups and kids, you wash hands when you arrive at school.
[26:02.500 --> 26:04.500]  You wash hands when you leave school.
[26:04.500 --> 26:07.500]  And you go and you wash hands at every transition point throughout the day.
[26:07.500 --> 26:11.500]  And I'm not a hand-washing lunatic, except that I have seen the difference.
[26:11.500 --> 26:13.500]  And I, I know what a difference it makes.
[26:13.500 --> 26:18.500]  It doesn't, it won't, like, stop your kid from getting sick, but it makes a huge difference.
[26:18.500 --> 26:22.500]  Because you just think about, like, we go downtown, we ride public transit, we go to the movies,
[26:22.500 --> 26:25.500]  and then my kid, like, you know, grabs some popcorn and sticks it in her mouth.
[26:25.500 --> 26:28.500]  I'm like, are you kidding? Do you have any idea where your hand has been?
[26:28.500 --> 26:31.500]  Do you know how much of San Francisco is on your hand right now?
[26:31.500 --> 26:32.500]  It's true.
[26:32.500 --> 26:36.500]  Yeah. I mean, you know, ugh, she just sits on the floor on public transit.
[26:36.500 --> 26:38.500]  It's like, don't do that. Like, what are you, what are you doing?
[26:38.500 --> 26:41.500]  Not at her school now. No, no, you know, they're real busy.
[26:41.500 --> 26:44.500]  They're real busy. They can't wash hands all the time.
[26:44.500 --> 26:47.500]  And so, she gets sick a lot more.
[26:47.500 --> 26:52.500]  I, I realize, I realize, I see the logic of the legislation.
[26:52.500 --> 26:54.500]  You know, the, the employees must wash hands.
[26:54.500 --> 26:58.500]  That there's, it must be a sign that states those exact words in every restaurant.
[26:58.500 --> 27:02.500]  Yeah, I think you have to put up the sign. I don't know if you have to enforce the actual hand washing.
[27:02.500 --> 27:08.500]  But I, the thing that always gets me about those signs is the idea that if you're not an employee,
[27:08.500 --> 27:11.500]  whatever you want to do.
[27:11.500 --> 27:21.500]  Yeah, but conversely, also, don't you kind of love the idea of somebody who works in a kitchen that has to be reminded to wash their hands after taking a shit?
[27:21.500 --> 27:23.500]  Or just touching the door.
[27:23.500 --> 27:29.500]  I know, I know.
[27:29.500 --> 27:33.500]  We started watching Kitchen Nightmares. Now I don't want to eat out anymore.
[27:33.500 --> 27:36.500]  This show's terrible.
[27:36.500 --> 27:37.500]  I don't want to watch a show like that.
[27:37.500 --> 27:40.500]  What have you done to this avocado?
[27:40.500 --> 27:41.500]  Who's the host of that show?
[27:41.500 --> 27:43.500]  That, uh, Gordon Ramsay.
[27:43.500 --> 27:45.500]  Oh, that's what I thought. Yeah, you know what?
[27:45.500 --> 27:50.500]  Jonas and Amy like to watch that show. I, I, I choose not to.
[27:50.500 --> 27:55.500]  You should not. You should not. He also does Hotel Hell, which is similar. It's with hotels.
[27:55.500 --> 27:58.500]  And he seems like he, you know, he's a pretty smart guy.
[27:58.500 --> 28:03.500]  It seems like, I feel like every episode, he seems like a guy who probably wants to do a little less coke than he does.
[28:03.500 --> 28:05.500]  He's very, very animated.
[28:05.500 --> 28:11.500]  Um, yeah, kind of a hair trigger, but you know, it's what it's formulaic, uh, you know, comfort food.
[28:11.500 --> 28:17.500]  How would we get the kids to Australia? Would it be by, uh, like a ship or how would that, how would that work?
[28:17.500 --> 28:20.500]  I don't know.
[28:20.500 --> 28:27.500]  I see some of my friend John Roderick and I have talked about is how useful it would be, like, instead, in lieu of, like,
[28:27.500 --> 28:32.500]  middle school, you send kids out to work in a national park for, like, three years.
[28:32.500 --> 28:38.500]  Because, just to, first of all, get them away from us, get them out of society, and get them somewhere where they can really be exhausted.
[28:38.500 --> 28:41.500]  They'd have to make their own clothes from things that they find while they're working during the day.
[28:41.500 --> 28:48.500]  You know, it would be kind of like, what, it would be like, uh, you know, Hunger Games meets Lord of the Flies.
[28:48.500 --> 28:53.500]  Which is, I guess, already kind of Lord of the Flies, but, uh, yeah.
[28:53.500 --> 28:59.500]  It'd be good for everybody. It'd be good for them. You become strong, you get a tan, you learn how to make a bunk bed.
[28:59.500 --> 29:03.500]  Maybe what we could do instead, those are all very good ideas.
[29:03.500 --> 29:10.500]  What we could do instead is maybe pick one of the states here in the U.S. and make it a no children state.
[29:10.500 --> 29:14.500]  And then we'd have subsidies so all the children who are already there...
[29:14.500 --> 29:16.500]  Sort of like a smoking area in restaurants.
[29:16.500 --> 29:20.500]  Exactly. Exactly what I'm thinking. But we'll do the whole state.
[29:20.500 --> 29:28.500]  We'll have some kind of subsidy system set up so that everybody who already has children, you know, will be able to move somewhere nice.
[29:28.500 --> 29:35.500]  And then we'll, let's just see what happens to the remaining adults in that state, how frequently they get the cold or flu.
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.500]  And I'll bet that they don't get it at all.
[29:37.500 --> 29:39.500]  Plus they can afford to retire.
[29:39.500 --> 29:46.500]  Except for the ones, and then we'd have to have something in place for, uh, you know, what do you call it when you...
[29:46.500 --> 29:52.500]  Quarantine. A quarantine for anybody who leaves and goes to like, say, Disney World or something like that.
[29:52.500 --> 29:53.500]  You'd have to...
[29:53.500 --> 29:57.500]  Oh, I see, they'd have to pass through a zone where we make sure that they haven't brought any kid germs with them.
[29:57.500 --> 29:58.500]  Yeah.
[29:58.500 --> 30:04.500]  That's pretty good. I think a lot of people would love that. Based on the glares that we get when we eat out, I think a lot of people would be happy with that state.
[30:04.500 --> 30:12.500]  Yeah. Maybe there could be a state just for people who don't want to be around kids or have kids or just even know kids exist.
[30:12.500 --> 30:16.500]  And then there could be, well, I guess technically it would be San Francisco's Noe Valley.
[30:16.500 --> 30:19.500]  It would be a place that's dedicated just to people who are way too into their kids.
[30:19.500 --> 30:21.500]  You know what I mean?
[30:21.500 --> 30:29.500]  It would be like the first time you go to a parent's meeting for a school and you're like, ugh, yikes.
[30:29.500 --> 30:38.500]  You're like, I'm really glad I'm not any of the people who are here. I don't like the way anybody here is raising their kids.
[30:38.500 --> 30:43.500]  Tyler! Tyler Marie! Tyler Marie! Have you done your Mandarin?
[30:43.500 --> 30:46.500]  Shut up. Just shut up.
[30:46.500 --> 30:49.500]  What percentage of children today are named Skylar?
[30:49.500 --> 30:57.500]  Oh, you got Skylar and you got Tyler. I think Skylar might have been hot a while back. There's a lot of Annabelas.
[30:57.500 --> 31:00.500]  We get a lot of... What do you get there?
[31:00.500 --> 31:07.500]  I've lost track. I used to keep track. That was a real thing of mine when Jonah started school and I've since lost track.
[31:07.500 --> 31:18.500]  And the worst part is I could really see Amy doing this. The problem for me is I have an explosion of laughter before I even have a second to realize how awful it is to laugh at a child's name.
[31:18.500 --> 31:29.500]  I'll just go, BAH! I feel so bad. Anastasia helicopter. Or like, my daughter has a friend whose little sister is named Daenerys.
[31:29.500 --> 31:35.500]  I can't decide. It's kind of a super cool name. It's kind of pretty weird. But it's cool. Like Daenerys. That's a cool name.
[31:35.500 --> 31:38.500]  What is that? Game of Houses? House of Cards?
[31:38.500 --> 31:39.500]  Game of Thrones.
[31:39.500 --> 31:42.500]  Yeah, exactly. It's from that show. It's the Lady with the Dragons. No spoilers.
[31:42.500 --> 31:47.500]  That's kind of a cool name, but now she's got like a Welsh name. She's got to spell the people for the rest of her life.
[31:47.500 --> 31:53.500]  I don't know. You see, the thing is everybody suffers from this because you try and get ahead of it. I bet this happened to you.
[31:53.500 --> 31:58.500]  When we picked our kid's name, it was not like a super popular name and it seemed like...
[31:58.500 --> 32:06.500]  This is one of those John Siracusa things where you think you're doing this thing outside of the culture and the evolution and then like a year later your kid has the same name as everybody.
[32:06.500 --> 32:08.500]  And you're like, how did that happen?
[32:08.500 --> 32:13.500]  Well, now they're naming tropicals or winter storms after my kid. Is that common?
[32:13.500 --> 32:20.500]  That's so embarrassing. You know, if they've got like stuff like t-shirts, you should buy them.
[32:20.500 --> 32:24.500]  I'm just sorry about his party. That's such a bummer.
[32:24.500 --> 32:37.500]  You know what Amy likes to do? I'll tell you, she's as happy as a pig on a poke today. What she likes to do, this is like a holiday for her, is that she likes to watch when there's a big snowstorm coming and they know it's coming.
[32:37.500 --> 32:39.500]  She likes to watch the local news.
[32:39.500 --> 32:41.500]  Oh, yeah.
[32:41.500 --> 32:43.500]  Because the local news.
[32:43.500 --> 32:48.500]  Oh, boy. They've been waiting all year for this day, maybe a few years for this day.
[32:48.500 --> 32:57.500]  There's a local Philadelphia news channel and they had a live report. She called me in to see it. She re-rounded on the TVO.
[32:57.500 --> 32:59.500]  She's like, you have to see this right before we started recording.
[32:59.500 --> 33:12.500]  They had a live report from a hardware store in Virginia that was rationing shovels and salt.
[33:12.500 --> 33:14.500]  Some people wanted to buy 10 shovels.
[33:14.500 --> 33:16.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[33:16.500 --> 33:17.500]  Now that is panic.
[33:17.500 --> 33:20.500]  Two shovels per customer limit.
[33:20.500 --> 33:31.500]  What if I break five of these? That's really, really odd. There's so many odd things about that. Why Virginia? Why that problem? Why report it?
[33:31.500 --> 33:37.500]  What were the stories that they rejected to decide that that was the right one to show in Philadelphia?
[33:37.500 --> 33:39.500]  I don't know.
[33:39.500 --> 33:50.500]  I sent you the link here. I'm looking at the page. I don't know if this is your old address, maybe, but I sent you a link there to a forecast. Right now, you've got 21 to 28 Fahrenheit today.
[33:50.500 --> 33:56.500]  Five to eight inches of snow starting in the evening. Tomorrow is the big day, right?
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.500]  Yeah, tomorrow is supposed to be the big day.
[33:58.500 --> 34:06.500]  So it's your Saturday. You get 12 to 18 inches throughout the day and windy until evening. Is that right? You might get like a foot and a half of snow?
[34:06.500 --> 34:17.500]  That's what they're saying. Honestly, what makes me think it's going to be bad is that it's actually gone up. Usually, they give you the worst 48, 72 hours in advance.
[34:17.500 --> 34:24.500]  They make a terrible prediction to get everybody hysterical.
[34:24.500 --> 34:25.500]  You have to get their attention.
[34:25.500 --> 34:36.500]  And then it gets closer and closer, and then they dial it down. This one, it was like they were talking about like 8 to 10 inches a day or two ago. Now they're talking, geez, look at that.
[34:36.500 --> 34:39.500]  That would be what? Like 17 to 23 inches total.
[34:39.500 --> 34:42.500]  Oh, God.
[34:42.500 --> 34:47.500]  Of all the things that we benefited from with cord cutting, one of my favorites is we just don't get local news anymore.
[34:47.500 --> 34:51.500]  We don't watch it ordinarily, but when we do, it...
[34:51.500 --> 34:53.500]  Doesn't it feel like culture shock?
[34:53.500 --> 34:59.500]  Yeah, it really does. And it's not so much that it's changed. It's just that it no longer seems normal to me.
[34:59.500 --> 35:12.500]  And so that the way that they handle stories, whether it's like this or whether it's just like an average day, the stuff that they decide to highlight and the way that they do it really stands out.
[35:12.500 --> 35:27.500]  And the way that I feel like in some ways it has not... The actual format and style of local TV news, like evening and nighttime news, has not changed that much since I was a kid, but it's changed enough in a couple of ways.
[35:27.500 --> 35:33.500]  I mean, there's... I don't know how this started, but whenever it became the tradition to have like top of the hour news, you get news, sports, and weather.
[35:33.500 --> 35:35.500]  And you always put weather... Is that still the case? Is that still how they do it?
[35:35.500 --> 35:36.500]  Oh, yeah.
[35:36.500 --> 35:41.500]  And you put weather last because you want people to watch. All they're really there for is to find out whether to wear a coat tomorrow or what coat to wear, right?
[35:41.500 --> 35:44.500]  They give you just a tease in the first 30 seconds.
[35:44.500 --> 35:46.500]  That's right. Yeah, exactly.
[35:46.500 --> 35:51.500]  There's some surprising weather news that you have got to... You've got to wait for this.
[35:51.500 --> 36:02.500]  Every day, every single day, 365 days a year, there is some surprising and important weather-related news, and Kathy is going to tell you about it later in the broadcast.
[36:02.500 --> 36:04.500]  Coming up right after Magnum PI.
[36:04.500 --> 36:08.500]  Are deadly fecal bacteria living on your doorknob?
[36:08.500 --> 36:09.500]  Right.
[36:09.500 --> 36:10.500]  You don't tell us after.
[36:10.500 --> 36:16.500]  In the first three minutes of the broadcast, Kathy will come on, and all she's going to say is, Jim, just wait until you hear this.
[36:16.500 --> 36:24.500]  You're not going to fucking believe this. Oh, my God. We better wait though. Let's talk about this apartment fire first.
[36:24.500 --> 36:25.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[36:25.500 --> 36:32.500]  But the way I feel like it has changed is that as much as it felt very glossy when I was a kid in the 1970s... Oh, my goodness.
[36:32.500 --> 36:49.500]  Everything, the motion graphics, everything is so much glossier now, and it just really seems like they've gotten it down to a science where it's extremely professional chipper people reporting horrible, horrible things, like, horrible, dangerous things.
[36:49.500 --> 37:05.500]  I mean, I'm far from the first person to say this, but I'm always struck when I watch it that so much more about American culture and society makes sense to me when I watch local news because I think, wow, if you really did watch this as one of your primary sources of information about the world, I'd be losing my mind too.
[37:05.500 --> 37:08.500]  I'd be stocking up on guns and snow shovels as well.
[37:08.500 --> 37:13.500]  It's like you really feel like everybody is getting killed.
[37:13.500 --> 37:18.500]  Everybody's getting killed or they're dying from something they can't prevent.
[37:18.500 --> 37:29.500]  I think it's why I've said this to Amy before, like most of our family lives within an hour of Philadelphia, overwhelming majority of our family, and nobody ever wants to come see us here.
[37:29.500 --> 37:38.500]  And I think it's because of TV news because they think if you travel in the city, you're either going to get shot or the building you're in is going to catch fire.
[37:38.500 --> 37:42.500]  Catch on fire.
[37:42.500 --> 37:49.500]  I think it's getting one of those increasingly all too common fire stabbings that they have in Philadelphia.
[37:49.500 --> 37:56.500]  Yeah, I don't know. Gosh, I hope it goes okay now. Like, down where Casey List is, down there in the Virginia, they're getting it even worse, right?
[37:56.500 --> 37:59.500]  Oh, yeah, that's like the epicenter.
[37:59.500 --> 38:04.500]  Yeah, that's the epicenter. And DC, yeah, the whole, what do they call it down there, Beltway.
[38:04.500 --> 38:05.500]  Sure.
[38:05.500 --> 38:21.500]  I'm going to point this out about the TV news before we move off it. The thing that strikes me when I watch it now, and I grew up with it, and they certainly did the same thing back then, but I just accepted it as that's how you do TV news, is the way that the correspondents, you know, there's the anchor person at the desk.
[38:21.500 --> 38:31.500]  Maybe there's two, maybe there's a man and a woman, but, you know, there's, you know, an anchor person or two at a desk in the studio who lead the broadcast and introduce every story, and then they go to a correspondent.
[38:31.500 --> 38:45.500]  And no matter what the story is, no matter what sense it makes, the correspondent needs to be outdoors somewhere in the TV broadcast area.
[38:45.500 --> 38:52.500]  And it doesn't matter what the story is. They could just be on some random street corner, but they have to be.
[38:52.500 --> 39:03.500]  They'll be reporting, for example, they might be doing something about like a Federal Reserve report for that matter, but they've got to be outside somewhere like outside of Walmart in order to like deliver that.
[39:03.500 --> 39:11.500]  And then they absolutely, positively must find someone walking by who will stop and talk to them for 10 seconds about the story.
[39:11.500 --> 39:24.500]  Yeah, yeah, no, it's like, yeah, it's, there's, I think increasingly, you've got to have at least two or three people. And I think that the way, one way that becomes so addictive to watch is there's always something happening.
[39:24.500 --> 39:32.500]  There's always another transition coming. There's always another thing you're looking forward to happening. You're teasing the next thing you throw to the other person, the motion graphic goes on.
[39:32.500 --> 39:44.500]  It's just like, you know, when I watch CNN to me, it feels like a demo reel for like a motion graphic company. It doesn't feel like there's really anything very substantial to learn. You could get it down to three bullets, basically what half an hour of CNN does.
[39:44.500 --> 39:47.500]  But I think the the style of it is very engrossing to people.
[39:47.500 --> 40:03.500]  All right, let me take a break here and tell you about our good friends at Backblaze. Backblaze is an online backup for your Mac. They have over 150 petabytes of data backed up. A few months ago, they told me how much a petabyte is and it doesn't even matter.
[40:03.500 --> 40:14.500]  It's ridiculous. Go look it up on Wikipedia if you want, but it's ridiculous. It's an enormous amount of data that they have backed up. They have restored over 10 billion files for their customers.
[40:14.500 --> 40:24.500]  Now I've been telling you about Backblaze forever. It could not be more simple. Here's how it works. You download their software, you install it on your Mac, your interface to it is just a system preferences panel.
[40:24.500 --> 40:32.500]  You don't have to touch anything. You just create an account and you can create this account for the free demo period without any credit card or anything.
[40:32.500 --> 40:39.500]  You create an account and then it just uploads all of your stuff to their servers in the cloud. And that's it. You don't have to do anything.
[40:39.500 --> 40:50.500]  Now it might take a while. I actually just added to my desktop Mac here an external storage drive where I keep all my old movies and video files and stuff like that.
[40:50.500 --> 40:58.500]  I think it has like a terabyte of data on it and I don't have a very good connection. It took like two weeks for this thing to upload.
[40:58.500 --> 41:06.500]  The first one took me I think over a month, but after that it's all incremental and it just goes.
[41:06.500 --> 41:15.500]  It took like two weeks, but now I've got this whole terabyte drive backed up to the cloud in addition to all my regular stuff which has been backed up on Backblaze for a long time.
[41:15.500 --> 41:22.500]  There is no limit. They don't have any limit. If you have a four terabyte drive, you can just upload that. It might take a while.
[41:22.500 --> 41:25.500]  Maybe you have fast internet. Maybe it won't take a while. It doesn't matter.
[41:25.500 --> 41:36.500]  Can I jump in to make a suggestion here? Because I love this product. I sent you a link right now. Don't run this test right now, but go to this. If you all are out there, go to backblaze.com slash speedtest and they will tell you a little bit about how the throttling works.
[41:36.500 --> 41:43.500]  Throttling, you can choose to have automatic or manual throttling. So if you want to not have it be disruptive to what you're doing on your local network, you can tell it that.
[41:43.500 --> 41:50.500]  You can say do that automatically. You can do it. Or you could just say open this sucker all the way up because I really want this stuff to get to the cloud.
[41:50.500 --> 41:59.500]  The reason I mention this, you go to this page and it will run a speedtest on your connection and let you know exactly how much stuff you will be able to upload per day.
[41:59.500 --> 42:04.500]  So you get an idea how long it will actually take. You won't be wondering when will this be done. They make that easy for you.
[42:04.500 --> 42:10.500]  And if you can afford to leave that thing wide open and you don't get dinged by your provider by Cable Town, that stuff will just flow straight into the cloud.
[42:10.500 --> 42:14.500]  I think that Cable Town dinged me when I was uploading that terabyte drive.
[42:14.500 --> 42:15.500]  Did they give you the slowdown?
[42:15.500 --> 42:23.500]  Yeah, I think they did. But it's hard for me to tell because the Cable Town's always dinged me. Anyway, the Backblaze, it works great. That's it.
[42:23.500 --> 42:27.500]  You just install this thing, you create an account, and then your stuff is there in the cloud.
[42:27.500 --> 42:36.500]  And if you ever need it, you can get all of your stuff put on a USB drive and they will ship it by UPS or FedEx or something like that if a catastrophe hits.
[42:36.500 --> 42:41.500]  But most of the time when people restore stuff from Backblaze, it's just like one file at a time.
[42:41.500 --> 42:49.500]  If you just need that one file and you're away from your computer, you can use their iOS app from your phone to get to any of the files that you have backed up in Backblaze.
[42:49.500 --> 42:55.500]  Get that file and send an email to whoever you want to send it to right there from your phone. Right there. It is such a relief.
[42:55.500 --> 43:08.500]  This is the thing I always emphasize with Backblaze is that when you know that everything you have is backed up in some other way in addition to whatever else you're doing locally in your office, you know, like with super duper clones or whatever else you might be doing,
[43:08.500 --> 43:17.500]  to know that you've got your stuff backed up in the cloud off with somebody you can trust, it's such a relief. It really is. I can't recommend them highly enough.
[43:17.500 --> 43:25.500]  Where do you go to find out more if you haven't signed up already, which I can't believe that there are still listeners to this show who haven't, but apparently there are.
[43:25.500 --> 43:26.500]  Shame on them, John. Shame on them.
[43:26.500 --> 43:30.500]  Shame on them. This is a sponsor who I would like to get rid of.
[43:30.500 --> 43:36.500]  I would like to get rid of by having everybody who listens to this show sign up and use them and then Backblaze would say,
[43:36.500 --> 43:41.500]  this is great. We love the response, but now nobody else is signing up because everybody's already signed up.
[43:41.500 --> 43:47.500]  And that would make me feel great because it would make me feel good to know that everybody out there, you guys are backing up to somewhere in the cloud.
[43:47.500 --> 43:55.500]  Go here. Get a no credit card required trial. Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[43:55.500 --> 44:01.500]  That's all you have to do. Backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[44:01.500 --> 44:09.500]  I think years ago, I think I mispronounced it. I think I said years ago on Backblaze read, I called him Black Baze or something.
[44:09.500 --> 44:15.500]  Black Blaze. And they went and registered the domain.
[44:15.500 --> 44:23.500]  That's interesting. Let me see if they've still got it. No, not Black Baze. Maybe Black Blaze. Something mispronounced.
[44:23.500 --> 44:24.500]  Sounds kind of dirty.
[44:24.500 --> 44:28.500]  Yeah, it does. A little bit. Oh, yeah. Go to Black Blaze. Go to blackblaze.com.
[44:28.500 --> 44:29.500]  I love that.
[44:29.500 --> 44:39.500]  Do it. Go to blackblaze.com. And I believe that they registered it because of a mispronunciation that I did on their show.
[44:39.500 --> 44:42.500]  Oh, yeah. Totally redirects. That's great.
[44:42.500 --> 44:43.500]  Oh, my God.
[44:43.500 --> 44:50.500]  So, my thanks to Black Blaze for doing that.
[44:50.500 --> 44:53.500]  That's the evil twin of Backblaze. It's the one that's got the handlebar mustache.
[44:53.500 --> 44:54.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[44:54.500 --> 44:55.500]  It looks otherwise identical.
[44:55.500 --> 44:59.500]  A jet black handlebar mustache.
[44:59.500 --> 45:05.500]  Now I'm looking. I Googled snow on the internet and with the news section.
[45:05.500 --> 45:12.500]  A lot of pictures of empty grocery shelves and people in line waiting to buy things.
[45:12.500 --> 45:18.500]  Here's the thing. I've said this before in years past. I understand the need to stock up on groceries.
[45:18.500 --> 45:24.500]  We've done it. We've already gone and we've bought some staples to make sure that we've got not just food to eat,
[45:24.500 --> 45:29.500]  but maybe, you know, actually, you know, meals that we have in the house ready to prepare.
[45:29.500 --> 45:32.500]  Sure. And some 1.75 liter size bottles.
[45:32.500 --> 45:39.500]  But it still boggles my mind the way that there are certain staples that literally sell out.
[45:39.500 --> 45:46.500]  Like, I would guarantee you that when we finish recording this show today, if I go to the Acme down the street.
[45:46.500 --> 45:49.500]  There's going to be no bread.
[45:49.500 --> 45:50.500]  No bread.
[45:50.500 --> 45:57.500]  Because, you know, when you're really, really getting attacked by snow, you're going to want to have some bread.
[45:57.500 --> 45:59.500]  Oh, my God.
[45:59.500 --> 46:01.500]  We're out of bread.
[46:01.500 --> 46:06.500]  But ordinarily there's so much bread in that supermarket that there's so much bread.
[46:06.500 --> 46:12.500]  It's like it's ridiculous. You don't realize how big that section is until it's been totally cleared out during a snowstorm.
[46:12.500 --> 46:18.500]  Right. And it's when it's cleared out, you realize that all the weird bread is gone, too.
[46:18.500 --> 46:23.500]  Yeah, all that kind of dark bread only like your older relatives like.
[46:23.500 --> 46:26.500]  Why is your bread so dark?
[46:26.500 --> 46:28.500]  Stuff with weird seeds that you don't even know what it is.
[46:28.500 --> 46:30.500]  With weird seeds? Yeah, exactly.
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.500]  Oh, my goodness.
[46:32.500 --> 46:33.500]  It's all gone.
[46:33.500 --> 46:39.500]  We make light, but I, you know, this won't come out until the damage is done, right?
[46:39.500 --> 46:41.500]  We should probably watch our ass.
[46:41.500 --> 46:43.500]  Well, it might come out. It'll probably come out tomorrow.
[46:43.500 --> 46:44.500]  Oh, good.
[46:44.500 --> 46:46.500]  It could come out later today.
[46:46.500 --> 46:48.500]  Never know. That won't happen.
[46:48.500 --> 46:50.500]  Oh, God.
[46:50.500 --> 46:53.500]  I don't know. What else do people buy? They buy eggs.
[46:53.500 --> 46:56.500]  That's another one, too, where it's good to have eggs in the house. I enjoy eggs.
[46:56.500 --> 47:01.500]  I feel like maybe there was like some brochure that went around in like from the 50s to the 70s.
[47:01.500 --> 47:05.500]  It's the same shit everybody buys. You buy canned soup, you buy bread, right?
[47:05.500 --> 47:08.500]  You got to have non-perishable items, right?
[47:08.500 --> 47:11.500]  You got to have things that you could make over the hot plate that you don't actually own.
[47:11.500 --> 47:12.500]  There's all the things that you would need.
[47:12.500 --> 47:18.500]  But you go into this lizard brain thing where you just click and your brain goes into buy stuff at the grocery store mode.
[47:18.500 --> 47:22.500]  And then, of course, it's like the stock market. It's just like trading places.
[47:22.500 --> 47:25.500]  You go in there and you see everybody freaking out, and that makes you freak out.
[47:25.500 --> 47:27.500]  I think that's exactly it.
[47:27.500 --> 47:32.500]  I think that maybe you go in there and you think, well, I want to get bread because I'm supposed to get bread.
[47:32.500 --> 47:35.500]  And I'm just going to pick up a loaf of bread. Oh, my God.
[47:35.500 --> 47:42.500]  And you see that the guy next to you is taking two loaves of bread, and you think, I better get...
[47:42.500 --> 47:45.500]  You see you're punching some lady in the neck because she's touching your butter top.
[47:45.500 --> 47:49.500]  And then all of a sudden you're buying three loaves of Wonder Bread.
[47:49.500 --> 47:51.500]  I've never bought this before.
[47:51.500 --> 47:57.500]  But you feel like if you don't buy these three loaves of Wonder Bread, you won't be able to get it an hour from now.
[47:57.500 --> 48:02.500]  Yeah, like it seems like you should probably buy crappier stuff than you normally buy because maybe it'll last longer.
[48:02.500 --> 48:05.500]  Like, don't get the Progresso. Get the generic brand soup.
[48:05.500 --> 48:09.500]  That'll be better when you go into your theoretical bunker. Bring that along.
[48:09.500 --> 48:15.500]  There's shelves here that have been totally wiped clean of all lettuce, so maybe this is a big salad event.
[48:15.500 --> 48:18.500]  Maybe you have a lock-in and you make some Caesar salad.
[48:18.500 --> 48:21.500]  You guys, you don't get snow in San Francisco.
[48:21.500 --> 48:26.500]  You guys get a lot of weird weather, but snow is not something you guys have to deal with.
[48:26.500 --> 48:32.500]  We get our climate. It's not our weather. It's our climate. Our climate is very unconventional.
[48:32.500 --> 48:41.500]  And the short version is, as you probably know, is that we have, because of our proximity to what is called the Golden Gate,
[48:41.500 --> 48:45.500]  San Francisco sits astride a big hole in California.
[48:45.500 --> 48:50.500]  And so basically the cold air over the ocean, there's the cold air over the ocean and there's the very hot air over the basin,
[48:50.500 --> 48:53.500]  like where they grow a lot of the vegetables, and that causes some very strange things.
[48:53.500 --> 48:57.500]  For one thing, our air is incredibly clean, because it's basically being washed every day.
[48:57.500 --> 48:59.500]  It's being moved out and in every day.
[48:59.500 --> 49:05.500]  But it also means stuff like, you know, you might start out at a certain temperature in the morning and then it gets colder.
[49:05.500 --> 49:10.500]  Then it gets warmer for an hour from 3 to 4, and then it plummets again at night.
[49:10.500 --> 49:15.500]  And it explains stuff like why it's cold in the summer. It's cold here.
[49:15.500 --> 49:22.500]  It's warm in October, and then it rains for most of late December, January, February.
[49:22.500 --> 49:29.500]  My favorite evergreen WWDC joke, WWDC is almost always held in June, is, you know,
[49:29.500 --> 49:35.500]  Hey, first-timers, it's sunny California. Don't bother taking a jacket or jeans.
[49:35.500 --> 49:39.500]  Yeah, you know, German tourists, it's just an evergreen source of humor.
[49:39.500 --> 49:42.500]  The poor bastards, they go, I'm going to das California.
[49:42.500 --> 49:45.500]  And it's like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be like 50 every day.
[49:45.500 --> 49:48.500]  Well, they used to give out backpacks for attendees.
[49:48.500 --> 49:55.500]  They'd give out backpacks or laptop bags of some sort and, you know, embroidered with WWDC and then the two digits of the year.
[49:55.500 --> 49:58.500]  And then like three or four years ago, they started giving out jackets.
[49:58.500 --> 50:01.500]  And they've done jackets ever since.
[50:01.500 --> 50:05.500]  And I asked somebody at Apple once, is that because so many people, you know, and you see people wearing them,
[50:05.500 --> 50:07.500]  is it because so many people come and they need them?
[50:07.500 --> 50:10.500]  And they're like, yeah, exactly. That's exactly it.
[50:10.500 --> 50:17.500]  And that people, you know, attendees come up and they say, like, I can't do the German accent, but the German accent.
[50:17.500 --> 50:21.500]  Thank you for this jacket. I'd be dead without it.
[50:21.500 --> 50:25.500]  Danke. Yeah. You ever go up to Twin Peaks?
[50:25.500 --> 50:26.500]  No.
[50:26.500 --> 50:28.500]  Oh, it's really, you should do it sometime. It's pretty cool.
[50:28.500 --> 50:30.500]  There's not that many things I recommend about San Francisco.
[50:30.500 --> 50:38.500]  But you drive up in near the, somewhat near the geographical center of town, basically at the end of Market Street.
[50:38.500 --> 50:41.500]  So Market Street begins at the Embarcadero, the ferry building.
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.500]  There's the part of Market Street you're familiar with by Moscone.
[50:43.500 --> 50:49.500]  And then if you go all the way to the end of Market Street, essentially it, it mostly ends, it ends at the Castro.
[50:49.500 --> 50:51.500]  And then you'll see this big mountain.
[50:51.500 --> 50:57.500]  And so anyway, you go up this big hill to get to my neighborhood and Twin Peaks are these two big mountains in the middle of San Francisco.
[50:57.500 --> 51:02.500]  And it's where that big tower is, that robot looking tower you see.
[51:02.500 --> 51:07.500]  But if you go up there, man, you, and it's clear, you get this amazing view of the city.
[51:07.500 --> 51:11.500]  It's just, it's really, really beautiful. One of the very few actually nice things in San Francisco.
[51:11.500 --> 51:19.500]  But of course you go up a mountain in San Francisco and it's like, it's, you know, 10 to 20 degrees colder than it was where you were.
[51:19.500 --> 51:24.500]  Plus it's incredibly windy. So you just see these little, these little ladies up there just like selling sweatshirts.
[51:24.500 --> 51:28.500]  They just, they go up there at eight in the morning and they just sell sweatshirts all day long.
[51:28.500 --> 51:32.500]  Yeah, yeah, I want to see that view from the Twin Peaks.
[51:32.500 --> 51:40.500]  I, I feel like I probably, maybe even a majority of the people who listen to my show have been to San Francisco at least once.
[51:40.500 --> 51:43.500]  I mean, I feel like it's, you know, it's probably an awful lot.
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.500]  I know that an awful lot of people who read my stuff and listen to it or, you know, work out there.
[51:47.500 --> 51:52.500]  And, you know, if you work anywhere, even vaguely Northern California, of course you've been to San Francisco.
[51:52.500 --> 51:56.500]  But for, you know, there's probably a lot of people who, you know, just have never had reason to go.
[51:56.500 --> 52:03.500]  I feel like you can hear these stories about how the weather in San Francisco is incredibly isolated, you know, from the area around it.
[52:03.500 --> 52:04.500]  But you just can't.
[52:04.500 --> 52:10.500]  So you walk around within two blocks, you could change, you know, basically be a different climate for reasons that are very unclear.
[52:10.500 --> 52:17.500]  Why is it cold here? I'm only, I've just moved, I've just gone from Union Square down to, you know.
[52:17.500 --> 52:21.500]  How is the wind blowing from both directions?
[52:21.500 --> 52:25.500]  Like all of a sudden you're down by, what are they called, AT&T Park, wherever the Giants play.
[52:25.500 --> 52:26.500]  Yeah, sure, sure.
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.500]  It's 15 degrees colder.
[52:27.500 --> 52:29.500]  I know, I know. It's bananas.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.500]  Right.
[52:30.500 --> 52:31.500]  Yeah.
[52:31.500 --> 52:34.500]  I hope it all goes well for you, you know. God bless you.
[52:34.500 --> 52:37.500]  I hope it's fun.
[52:37.500 --> 52:42.500]  Now, do you face, I don't want to make this whole show, but I mean, do you face much in the way of damage?
[52:42.500 --> 52:45.500]  Like when I was in Florida and there's a hurricane coming, there's all kinds of stuff you gotta do.
[52:45.500 --> 52:50.500]  All the way from tape up the windows to like board over the windows.
[52:50.500 --> 52:53.500]  Do you have to do any special preparation when you know big snow is coming?
[52:53.500 --> 52:54.500]  No.
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.500]  No.
[52:55.500 --> 52:57.500]  Except stock up on bread.
[52:57.500 --> 52:58.500]  Mm-hmm.
[52:58.500 --> 52:59.500]  No.
[52:59.500 --> 53:03.500]  You know what, we as a family have it very easy.
[53:03.500 --> 53:06.500]  And I understand, again, this is just, it's just like kids getting sick.
[53:06.500 --> 53:10.500]  If you have a job where you've got to, it's important that you be there.
[53:10.500 --> 53:13.500]  Snowstorm is an enormous pain in the ass.
[53:13.500 --> 53:17.500]  And the fact that it's coming on a weekend could be good news for a lot of people.
[53:17.500 --> 53:20.500]  But there's still some people who have jobs that it's essential that they be there.
[53:20.500 --> 53:21.500]  Huge pain in the ass.
[53:21.500 --> 53:24.500]  Well, I guess where my office is. It's right downstairs.
[53:24.500 --> 53:31.500]  So the fact that we can easily and work wise, a snowstorm is often indistinguishable from
[53:31.500 --> 53:32.500]  a normal day for us.
[53:32.500 --> 53:34.500]  It's actually kind of nice.
[53:34.500 --> 53:36.500]  You're very fortunate.
[53:36.500 --> 53:41.500]  In any other generation, the idea of having your bedroom, your office and your bar be
[53:41.500 --> 53:45.500]  essentially the same room, that's powerful.
[53:45.500 --> 53:46.500]  Right.
[53:46.500 --> 53:47.500]  You got everything you need right there.
[53:47.500 --> 53:48.500]  You know what?
[53:48.500 --> 53:49.500]  You're like your own personal food court.
[53:49.500 --> 53:50.500]  Everything you need is right there.
[53:50.500 --> 53:51.500]  I like it.
[53:51.500 --> 53:56.500]  And sometimes it's just so nice in the city to have the big snow come and have very few
[53:56.500 --> 53:57.500]  cars on the road.
[53:57.500 --> 54:03.500]  You can go out and before the snow turns all grey and black from the cars that eventually
[54:03.500 --> 54:07.500]  get back on the road, everything looks beautiful and it's quiet.
[54:07.500 --> 54:12.500]  It is quiet in a way that you can't believe that the city could ever be this quiet.
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.500]  Because in addition to the fact that there's no or very few cars on the road, the snow
[54:16.500 --> 54:21.500]  is like a sound dampening soft substance.
[54:21.500 --> 54:23.500]  It's hard to even describe that sound.
[54:23.500 --> 54:29.500]  Even when I lived in the suburbs in Ohio, it's a very special winter feeling to go outside.
[54:29.500 --> 54:32.500]  It's very crisp, it's very quiet and it's very still.
[54:32.500 --> 54:35.500]  It just feels like everything has slowed down.
[54:35.500 --> 54:39.500]  I remember a couple of years ago, it's very vivid in my mind.
[54:39.500 --> 54:44.500]  My friend Michael Lop of Rands and Repose was in town for a conference of some sort
[54:44.500 --> 54:46.500]  or somebody had paid him for a speech.
[54:46.500 --> 54:47.500]  It was like a paid speaking kid.
[54:47.500 --> 54:50.500]  I don't know if it was a conference or a corporate thing, but he was in town.
[54:50.500 --> 54:52.500]  And a huge snowstorm hit.
[54:52.500 --> 54:55.500]  One of these, at least a foot of snow type things.
[54:55.500 --> 54:58.500]  And we went out to dinner, just the two of us.
[54:58.500 --> 55:01.500]  And there was nobody on the street.
[55:01.500 --> 55:06.500]  And the steakhouse was open and there was only one other table that was taken.
[55:06.500 --> 55:09.500]  Only two or three waiters were on shift and we asked the waiter,
[55:09.500 --> 55:11.500]  hey, was this a huge painting?
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.500]  He was like, I live in the city, what else am I going to do tonight?
[55:13.500 --> 55:14.500]  I don't care.
[55:14.500 --> 55:18.500]  So it was like empty steakhouse, super quiet, great meal.
[55:18.500 --> 55:21.500]  And I feel like it's because whoever was in the kitchen, it was like,
[55:21.500 --> 55:25.500]  well, we're only cooking like three things, might as well make it perfect.
[55:25.500 --> 55:26.500]  Great meal.
[55:26.500 --> 55:30.500]  And then we just went out and just walked back to his hotel and then I walked home.
[55:30.500 --> 55:33.500]  And it was like we were the only two people in the whole city of Philadelphia.
[55:33.500 --> 55:34.500]  It was amazing.
[55:34.500 --> 55:37.500]  It was like you can't make that up.
[55:37.500 --> 55:39.500]  That's such a great feeling.
[55:39.500 --> 55:44.500]  Yeah, something that Syracuse and I have ended up talking about on the show that we do is
[55:44.500 --> 55:49.500]  I'm always interested in what I would call like seam exposing events, right?
[55:49.500 --> 55:53.500]  And like the kinds of things where you don't realize how fragile something is
[55:53.500 --> 55:58.500]  until some complexity or difficulty is introduced and that's when the seams get exposed.
[55:58.500 --> 56:03.500]  And that's the thing I feel bad about with a city is if you look at a city like Atlanta,
[56:03.500 --> 56:06.500]  which is already so on the edge in terms of, you know,
[56:06.500 --> 56:11.500]  I think it has something like in the aggregate the most commuted miles per day.
[56:11.500 --> 56:12.500]  Oh, without question.
[56:12.500 --> 56:15.500]  Yeah, there was a New Yorker story about it a few years ago.
[56:15.500 --> 56:16.500]  It's ridiculous.
[56:16.500 --> 56:20.500]  I mean, it's actually shockingly bad in its scale and the amount of time, right?
[56:20.500 --> 56:21.500]  I mean, it's pretty bad.
[56:21.500 --> 56:23.500]  Most people commute like an hour or something like that.
[56:23.500 --> 56:24.500]  Yeah.
[56:24.500 --> 56:25.500]  Is that right?
[56:25.500 --> 56:26.500]  It's something like that.
[56:26.500 --> 56:27.500]  Ah, something like that.
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.500]  But then you introduce rain or, God forbid, you introduce snow to that
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.500]  or even the smallest bit of snow.
[56:32.500 --> 56:37.500]  There's not many accommodations that the city of Atlanta can make for snow.
[56:37.500 --> 56:41.500]  And that's the part where it starts to feel like they say the apocalypse, you know,
[56:41.500 --> 56:42.500]  where you think about so many places.
[56:42.500 --> 56:45.500]  Like what happens in California when it rains a lot, this happens everywhere.
[56:45.500 --> 56:48.500]  Like the first time it rains after it hasn't rained for a long time,
[56:48.500 --> 56:54.500]  there's all this oil and, you know, various detritus like just sitting there on the streets.
[56:54.500 --> 56:57.500]  And so once you start, you know, zooming around on there, that water basically,
[56:57.500 --> 57:00.500]  I don't know, I'm not a scientist, but like that makes the roads very slippery
[57:00.500 --> 57:06.500]  or the drains, you know, the ground can't absorb all the water because it's been so dry.
[57:06.500 --> 57:10.500]  It's just, I don't know, that's why I always brace for the first big snow
[57:10.500 --> 57:13.500]  or the first big, you know, rainstorm.
[57:13.500 --> 57:15.500]  I was like, Will, you know, can we take this?
[57:15.500 --> 57:19.500]  I was talking to Dan Fromer about it on this show.
[57:19.500 --> 57:20.500]  Was that last time?
[57:20.500 --> 57:21.500]  It was a good episode.
[57:21.500 --> 57:24.500]  And in Vegas when it rains, the cars are terrible.
[57:24.500 --> 57:25.500]  People don't know how to drive.
[57:25.500 --> 57:27.500]  And a couple of Vegas residents said it's, you know,
[57:27.500 --> 57:30.500]  in addition to the fact that people here don't really know how to drive with wet roads,
[57:30.500 --> 57:35.500]  it really is actually worse than typical wet roads because we get so little rain
[57:35.500 --> 57:40.500]  that there is like a coating of oil on the, what do you call it, the tarmac.
[57:40.500 --> 57:45.500]  For somebody who claims to like CES, wow, he really,
[57:45.500 --> 57:50.500]  I feel like every impulse I've ever had to go to CES, I'm really glad I didn't listen.
[57:50.500 --> 57:52.500]  That sounds so awful.
[57:52.500 --> 57:55.500]  I think you and I should go together.
[57:55.500 --> 57:57.500]  It sounds like you're committed for next year.
[57:57.500 --> 57:59.500]  You think we should go and do some reporting from there?
[57:59.500 --> 58:00.500]  I think we should.
[58:00.500 --> 58:03.500]  I think that within a couple of weeks I'll just file that away
[58:03.500 --> 58:07.500]  and do another show next year where I say, I'll go next year.
[58:07.500 --> 58:11.500]  Well, knowing your record with this, I'll make you this mostly promise.
[58:11.500 --> 58:14.500]  I'll go if you go, but I don't think you're going to go, so I'm not worried.
[58:14.500 --> 58:16.500]  I don't want to go.
[58:16.500 --> 58:18.500]  Oh, my goodness.
[58:18.500 --> 58:21.500]  That description of like the shuttle buses,
[58:21.500 --> 58:23.500]  like how long it took to go somewhere in a shuttle bus.
[58:23.500 --> 58:24.500]  Like I walk everywhere in Las Vegas.
[58:24.500 --> 58:26.500]  I can't imagine driving.
[58:26.500 --> 58:28.500]  If it's anywhere on the strip, you walk there.
[58:28.500 --> 58:29.500]  I mean, what's the worst thing that happens?
[58:29.500 --> 58:32.500]  You get an alcoholic beverage and walk.
[58:32.500 --> 58:35.500]  It's not hard, but like, oh, my God.
[58:35.500 --> 58:38.500]  Imagine all of those people who are like us being there at the same time,
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.500]  how miserable that would be.
[58:39.500 --> 58:41.500]  Oh, yeah, that's part of it.
[58:41.500 --> 58:43.500]  I remember one time I was in Vegas,
[58:43.500 --> 58:47.500]  and it was just by coincidence at the end of some massive convention.
[58:47.500 --> 58:50.500]  I don't even know what it was, but it must have been like CES-sized
[58:50.500 --> 58:57.500]  or close thereabouts, and we were like waiting for a cab somewhere,
[58:57.500 --> 58:59.500]  and it was like taking forever, and we're like,
[58:59.500 --> 59:03.500]  Oscar will just walk, and then it somehow came up that like we heard it,
[59:03.500 --> 59:09.500]  that they said that at the Venetian that there was a three-hour wait for cabs.
[59:09.500 --> 59:11.500]  A three-hour wait for cabs.
[59:11.500 --> 59:13.500]  Because it was the end of this massive convention,
[59:13.500 --> 59:15.500]  and everybody was leaving.
[59:15.500 --> 59:16.500]  Yeah, but think about that.
[59:16.500 --> 59:19.500]  Like who leaves for the airport three hours in advance?
[59:19.500 --> 59:20.500]  Nobody.
[59:20.500 --> 59:23.500]  So in other words, when they tell you it's a three-hour wait to get to the airport,
[59:23.500 --> 59:25.500]  that means you're missing your flight.
[59:25.500 --> 59:26.500]  Oh, no.
[59:26.500 --> 59:28.500]  And that's a thing you can't walk to.
[59:28.500 --> 59:29.500]  You can't walk to the airport.
[59:29.500 --> 59:32.500]  No, and the thing is that airport is not that big.
[59:32.500 --> 59:37.500]  In other words, it doesn't have that much tolerance for needing to expand.
[59:37.500 --> 59:38.500]  Right.
[59:38.500 --> 59:42.500]  So there are times when Vegas is, you know,
[59:42.500 --> 59:46.500]  as much as they can support truly massive conventions, conferences,
[59:46.500 --> 59:47.500]  whatever you want to call it,
[59:47.500 --> 59:53.500]  there are times when it still is ten pounds of shit in a five-pound bag.
[59:53.500 --> 59:57.500]  Well, you know, it's interesting if you think about, you know, I don't know,
[59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.500]  it's an interesting kind of planned community in some ways,
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:06.500]  because there seems to be even as much as Las Vegas has pivoted toward more
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.500]  or less family-friendly or more up or down scale,
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.500]  everybody's still mostly been marching in the same direction with Las Vegas
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500]  since, what, the 40s.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.500]  Right?
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.500]  I mean, the basic idea of what Las Vegas is for has not changed that much.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.500]  And I have to imagine, like, the infrastructure to support that,
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.500]  it mainly needs to grow and get bigger, but does it need to change that much?
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500]  Right.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.500]  You're always going to need prime rib, shrimp, liquor, and chips.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500]  Well, part of the problem-
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500]  It's not like you're suddenly going to need, like, you know,
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.500]  I guess you get live animals occasionally.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.500]  Like, if a white tiger dies, you get a fresh one.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500]  But, like, other than that, I mean,
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.500]  it's got to be a pretty steady supply train for making that place run,
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.500]  and I bet it's pretty easily disruptable.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.500]  Part of the problem is that they have a monorail that goes up and down the strip,
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.500]  but it's terrible.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500]  And Dan was saying on the show that at one point
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.500]  it was like an hour-long wait to get on the monorail,
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:00.500]  but the monorail is terribly, terribly located.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500]  It's, like, way behind the strip.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500]  I remember the first time I tried to take it, it was like,
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500]  this is great, we'll get out of these expensive cab rides,
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]  we'll take the monorail down.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500]  And then there are, like, these signs, like, monorail this way,
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.500]  and you go through the casino and they're like, you know,
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.500]  keep looking for signs that say where the monorail is.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.500]  And it's like, oh, yeah, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500]  Now you're going through the employee parking lot,
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500]  and it's monorail this way.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500]  And you're like, wait a minute.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.500]  Monorail.
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:32.500]  And then to get there and find out it's an hour wait, it's ridiculous.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.500]  But really, I mean, one of the big problems with Vegas is that
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.500]  they really are in desperate need of some public transportation.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:42.500]  And it wouldn't be that complicated, really, just up and down the strip.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.500]  And they don't have it.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.500]  I've often thought, what do you do if you're staying at the Venetian,
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.500]  your conference is over, you have a three o'clock flight,
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.500]  and it's one in the afternoon, and you think you're doing a responsible thing
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.500]  by leaving two hours.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.500]  It's not far.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500]  Once you're in a cab...
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500]  No, it's like as soon as you pull out from the airport,
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.500]  you can already see the strip.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500]  It feels very, very close.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.500]  Like anything in a desert, it's kind of difficult to tell how far away something is.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.500]  Yeah, traffic permitting, it's usually a 10- or 15-minute cab ride.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.500]  So it's two hours in advance, and then they tell you
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.500]  it's going to be three hours until you get a cab.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500]  What do you do?
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.500]  Oh, my God, what do you do?
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.500]  In another time, even probably 20 years ago,
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500]  I would say you call up the airline and try to reschedule it
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.500]  and pay what used to be, I'm going to say, a $75 fee, something like that.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:30.500]  It used to be that flights were more expensive, but you could do more with them.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500]  I think nowadays, almost everybody buys...
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.500]  I'm pulling this out of my ass.
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.500]  But nowadays, almost everybody buys non-refundable tickets.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500]  You always buy the least expensive thing,
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500]  but certainly back when my dad was flying,
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.500]  back when there were three different classes on every plane,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500]  they were costly, but you could do a lot more with them.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.500]  I feel like even 20 years ago, most airlines, for $75, $100,
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500]  you could change your flight.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500]  I don't know what you do in that case,
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500]  because it's sort of a can't-get-there-from-here situation.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500]  What are you going to do? Are you going to hire a local car?
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.500]  Well, they're not local. The modern-day thing,
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500]  the thing that you can do now is that you have a cell phone
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.500]  where maybe you can start stabbing your finger at your airline's website
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500]  and see if there's something you can do.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.500]  Right there, right now, you could just do it right now.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.500]  The other thing I thought you could do is, if you're in that situation,
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.500]  take your suitcase or suitcases and schlep them not to the airport,
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.500]  but maybe see if you can walk across the street to a different hotel
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500]  and see if you can get a cab there.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.500]  But my thought would be, wait, if there's a big line here,
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:35.500]  there's probably going to be a big line at every hotel that is nearby
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.500]  because the nearby ones are the same ones that the same people have been at.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500]  Yeah, that's one of those things, I'm so interested in these sorts of things,
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.500]  something that feels like a cause but is actually an effect.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500]  In that instance, the fact that there's a lineup for cabs
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  is not the source of the problem, it's the result of the problem.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:51.500]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.500]  It could just be that everybody's trying to get a cab right now.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:58.500]  So let's see here. You stay at the Wynn, is that right?
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.500]  Well, usually.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500]  Okay, I'm just trying to look here.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500]  Yeah, my God, look at that.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.500]  So you can see Mandalay Bay and Luxor practically from the airport.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.500]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.500]  It looks so close.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.500]  Ooh, the Mob Museum, wow.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500]  Sorry, I got the sneezes.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.500]  You might have caught something from me here on this.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500]  You know what? I wasn't going to say anything,
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.500]  but I was feeling fine when I got on this call.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500]  I even washed my hands.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500]  Wynn, Las Vegas, is that what you stay at?
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500]  Yeah, that's where I usually stay.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.500]  Okay, then you got the Palazzo, the Venetian, the Mirage, Treasure Island.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500]  There's the Flamingo, okay.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500]  And that's that big corner.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.500]  So that's the corner of Las Vegas and Flamingo is that big corner.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]  Right.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:49.500]  Did you ever tell me my daughter took her first step at the Bellagio?
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]  I think I told you that story.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500]  I think you did.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.500]  Yeah, I was doing a talk to the senior management
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.500]  at the founder of Cirque du Soleil's very purple house in Las Vegas.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.500]  Well, I got a call from my wife that in our room at the Bellagio,
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.500]  our exactly one-year-old daughter had taken her first step.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.500]  Oh, by the way, did I mention it was her first birthday?
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.500]  Cover your nose, honey.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.500]  We have to get through the casino to get to our room.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.500]  I feel like, depending on how our life turns out,
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.500]  it could either just be an amusing anecdote.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.500]  How many therapists will have to hear that story over the years?
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500]  It's either going to be a very amusing anecdote,
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:32.500]  like, wow, that's quite a story, or it's going to be, well, of course.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.500]  In and out for David.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500]  Oh, it all started out as it was so simple.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:40.500]  It seemed like such a joke.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500]  Oh, what else is going on?
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.500]  Well, I could take another break, and thanks.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.500]  Yeah, tell me about something you like, John.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.500]  I'll get a seltzer and wash my hands.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.500]  I'm going to tell you about our good friends at MailRoute.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500]  These guys are experts on email.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.500]  IT departments are expected to do more every year,
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:02.500]  but they're supposed to do it with less money because budgets are going down.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500]  Nobody is spending money on this stuff anymore.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.500]  Everybody expects a lot of stuff to be lower cost, whatever.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.500]  Here's something you could take off your hands
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.500]  if you're in an IT department in charge of stuff.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:18.500]  You could take off handling worrying about spam and email virus
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.500]  and sketchy attachments, stuff like that.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.500]  Use MailRoute instead.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.500]  Here's how it works.
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.500]  It is a simple service.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.500]  It doesn't host your email.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.500]  They're not asking you to move your email to trust them with storing your email.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.500]  All you do is you change your MX records for your mail domain
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500]  to point to them first.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.500]  Your email goes through them, and then MailRoute forwards it on
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.500]  to the mail servers you already have.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500]  So nothing changes, nothing moves.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.500]  You don't have to ask all of your users to go into their mail clients
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.500]  and change all of their settings and everything like that.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500]  To the users of the mail, everything stays the same
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.500]  because they still connect to the same servers with the same account,
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.500]  but because the mail goes through MailRoute's filters first
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.500]  before it gets to your servers, all the spam is gone,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500]  all the email with junk attachments and stuff like that
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500]  it's all gone.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.500]  It couldn't be more simple.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.500]  It couldn't work easier.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.500]  And it's really, really accurate.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:23.500]  I mean, this stuff is as accurate of a spam filtering as I've ever seen.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.500]  And you get access to, you can have things mailed to you,
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:32.500]  you can have a report mailed to you or to any of the users on the domain
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:37.500]  with like, hey, here's what we did for the last week,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.500]  here's the bunch of maybe emails that we flagged as spam.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500]  Take a look at them, and if any of them are incorrect,
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500]  here, just click this and we'll send it right through to your mailbox
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.500]  and we'll remember it in the future so that it won't be incorrectly flagged again.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500]  Really, really great service.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.500]  It takes an enormous problem off your hands,
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.500]  and it gives you the flexibility to host your mail the way you want it,
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.500]  how you want it without worrying about how your mail server deals with spam
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500]  because they just take it right out.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500]  Go to their domain. Here it is.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.500]  It's mailroute.net slash TTS.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.500]  Mailroute.net slash TTS.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.500]  The initials of the show, the talk show slash TTS.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.500]  Or if you want to, you can even email them and ask questions.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.500]  Just email them at sales at mailroute.net
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.500]  if you have questions before you sign up.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:32.500]  You get a 30-day free trial, so you can try it for 30 days without spending a dime.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.500]  And if you use that URL, mailroute.net slash TTS,
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.500]  you get 10% off for the lifetime of the account.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:44.500]  So if you use it for 20 years, you'll save 10% for the whole time.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500]  Couldn't be a better deal.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:54.500]  So go to mailroute.net slash TTS and get rid of spam and viruses.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.500]  I've heard more than one success story.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500]  Actually, Dan Medjimin was just talking about this,
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.500]  but I've heard lots of people say this, where they've had a domain
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.500]  where, what, 10 years ago, even 10 years ago,
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.500]  they were like, you know what, this one is out there.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.500]  There is just too much spam at every conceivable user at this.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500]  I will never get this back.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500]  God bless it. Gmail couldn't help this, and you're done.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.500]  And I've heard people go in and attach mailroute to that domain,
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500]  and it's like a miracle.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.500]  It's like something from an infomercial,
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.500]  where suddenly they've got that domain back.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.500]  It's so good at getting the spam with a scalpel
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500]  that you get your own domain back.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500]  What more can you say?
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.500]  I used to talk about some of the techniques that mailroute uses.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.500]  I feel like it's not even worth it anymore.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.500]  It's their problem to worry about the details of how they do it,
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500]  but it is amazing.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500]  Surgical is a good way to describe it.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.500]  You don't hear about Dan Medjimin on the show as much as you used to.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.500]  Is that right? On this particular show?
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.500]  Yeah, on the talk show.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500]  You mean like, for example, when he was the co-host?
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]  Exactly.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.500]  Well, technically, this is Mark 3.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.500]  How do you refer to it? First of all, for anybody who's listening in,
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.500]  it's the talk show.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500]  We should be clear about that.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500]  Oh, yeah, clearly Mark 3.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500]  And this is Mark 3.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.500]  Do you ever think about the future of the talk show, what Mark 4 would look like?
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500]  Would you bring Jonas on, maybe?
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.500]  It's kind of the same show.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.500]  The biggest change in the talk show,
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500]  well, obviously, when you and Dan weren't doing it together anymore,
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500]  it was quite different.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:34.500]  For example, Lonely Sandwich loved the original version of the talk show that you two did.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500]  I could never get into it.
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.500]  I could never get into it.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500]  It was when you and Dan were doing it that I really liked it.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.500]  When you think about that, that must seem pretty weird.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500]  That's a lot of change over time.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.500]  It does.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.500]  It's weird for me because it creeped up on me
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:00.500]  as a serious part of my business income.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500]  Your job.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.500]  It always seemed like I was a guy who wrote a website.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500]  Even at the point when the first incarnation,
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500]  what were the dates on that?
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500]  The first incarnation, you could still see it.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:20.500]  What is it? The talk show dot net.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.500]  You guys had done it for a while.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500]  Look at that.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500]  No, wait. 2007, huh?
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500]  Yeah, so that goes back to 2007.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.500]  When the hell did I start doing this shit full time?
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.500]  2006?
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500]  It was close to.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:42.500]  It was within a year of when I started doing Daring Fireball full time.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:49.500]  Daring Fireball was a career and doing a podcast was something you could do on the side
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.500]  and something that the nature of writing a blog as a full time job
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.500]  that I would easily have time to fit in.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500]  Look at the episode lengths.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:07.500]  34 minutes, 29 minutes, 35 minutes, 37 minutes, 36 minutes, 31 minutes.
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.500]  Some of them are over an hour, but most of them are under 45.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:16.500]  Episode 8 is 19 minutes and 28 seconds.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500]  Oh my God. We spent that on white bread today.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:26.500]  A half-size episode with our predictions for the upcoming Apple announcement later today.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.500]  Wow, wow, wow. This is amazing.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.500]  This is time travel.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.500]  You know what? It just snuck up over time that it is podcasting.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500]  I mean, you know this. You do a couple of shows.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:49.500]  Doing a podcast in 2000, even through the end of the run of this first one,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.500]  which was what? The last episode was 29th October 2009.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:58.500]  That was ahead of the time for podcasts.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.500]  There just weren't enough people.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.500]  I'd say even at that point still.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.500]  I mean, it still feels like there's an article every month or so
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.500]  that's essentially about how podcasts are finally becoming a thing.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.500]  I mean, it's a tired bit for those of us.
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.500]  It's even a bit as a bit at this point to joke about this
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.500]  because for what feels like five years now,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.500]  everybody who's been doing podcasts since the mid-2000s is saying,
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.500]  Oh, that's great. That's another meta joke.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500]  Because it's like once again, someone says,
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500]  Oh, you know, have you heard about this thing Serial?
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.500]  Because podcasts, which are like this and this and this are going to really be a thing.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.500]  And oh, you know, the mid-roll puts out another press release.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.500]  So somebody does an article about it and it's, you know,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500]  I don't have that much.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.500]  It doesn't frustrate me that much except that it is funny.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.500]  It frustrates other people much more than it does me
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.500]  because I think this is still so very much the earliest of days.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.500]  I mean, this to me is like as something like Ernie Kovacs was to TV
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500]  or like you may never see another Ernie Kovacs again
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.500]  because Ernie Kovacs could only have been Ernie Kovacs at that time, you know,
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500]  or for that matter, I mean, you think about any of those weird shows
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.500]  that were on in the 40s before they really knew what TV was going to be.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500]  Think about, I mean, go back even further. What was a movie?
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.500]  Well, a movie was mostly a camera sitting still
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.500]  and filming a bunch of people performing a play without sound, right?
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.500]  I mean, it was, you know, I don't know if he gets the appropriate amount of credit,
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.500]  but somebody like D.W. Griffith not only had much more ambition
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500]  in how you can tell a story with film,
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.500]  but what you could do with the camera as its own artifice
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.500]  or as its own, you know, tool and then introducing like, you know,
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500]  doing more than, you know, having things like close-ups
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500]  and then getting into things like editing.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500]  Think about the dimensions of editing that we just take for granted today.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.500]  But there was probably what, 10 or 15 years of filmmaking that went on
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:47.500]  where people were just walking around going, I guess this is a movie.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.500]  So we think about those and we might have nostalgia
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.500]  for watching The Sneeze or The Kiss or something like that,
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.500]  but, you know, it didn't take 15, 20 years before we go,
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500]  oh, now there really is a vocabulary.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.500]  You know, there's the 180-degree rule eventually.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.500]  There's all these different things of conventions,
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.500]  of understanding how we, you know, splice time and tell a story with film.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:10.500]  And I still think it's really early days for podcasts.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.500]  It's not anything as sexy or sophisticated as film,
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500]  but I think it's still very early days.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.500]  Well, the thing I've, it's the only part of my racket that's still growing.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.500]  Like the website does not, you know, any of the measurements that I could use,
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.500]  you know, RSS subscribers or page views or whatever.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.500]  It peaked a while ago.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500]  And I think I was talking about, I forget who I was talking about.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.500]  You were talking with Dan last week about it.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.500]  Yeah, about how, you know, once Google Reader went away,
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.500]  actually the numbers all went down and never really recovered.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500]  And I don't, again, I don't think that it means...
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.500]  Who knows like how much, it's not necessarily that that was the thing,
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.500]  but there was probably a variety of different things coming together
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.500]  to create a certain zeitgeist around that time.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:56.500]  Including the ascendance of, I have to be honest with you,
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.500]  a couple of people on Twitter have been mentioning a talk we did
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500]  at South by Southwest in 2009.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500]  And so I'll go back and listen to it once a year or so.
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.500]  And I'm still proud of it as something that we did.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.500]  And I love that people still like listening to it.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500]  And so that's 2009.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.500]  But, you know, even then we're there talking about, you know,
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.500]  the rise of things like Gawker or the rise of things like TechCrunch.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.500]  Even the TechCrunch at that point is what, four years old, five years old.
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.500]  But like, you know, you just think about like at that point Facebook was big,
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.500]  but Facebook was not what Facebook is today.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.500]  No.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500]  You know, it wasn't so much...
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.500]  That was still the time when we were still feeling a little miffed
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.500]  about how much people got their news from aggregation sites
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500]  rather than the sources that were writing them,
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:41.500]  which now today seems relatively quaint in comparison.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.500]  Facebook didn't even have their IPO until 2012,
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500]  which seems crazy because we just talk about them
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.500]  as like a pillar of the tech industry, you know.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.500]  Well, we weren't more than a few years off of Myspace
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500]  still kind of being the big thing.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.500]  I mean, that's a throwaway line now,
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:03.500]  but at a talk I did at South by Southwest the year before that,
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500]  I made mention of Myspace.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:10.500]  I mentioned Myspace in the inbox zero talk from 2006.
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:16.500]  So, you know, that seemed like the unvanquishable big player for a long time.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.500]  Which now everybody looks at it and laughs, but like, no, no, honestly.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.500]  Myspace really was the thing for a long time,
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.500]  and it just seemed like Facebook was going to have nicer typography
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500]  and be, you know, whatever.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500]  I'm not going to be a dork about it,
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500]  but Facebook seemed like the next Myspace.
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.500]  I'm pretty impressed with how much it has stuck around and grown
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500]  in that amount of time.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500]  Yeah, I wouldn't have predicted it.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.500]  But for you, so with where you are during Fireball,
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.500]  this is probably a little bit inside baseball,
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:53.500]  but is it that has the size of your slice stayed the same
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.500]  and the pie has gotten smaller?
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:57.500]  I don't know.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.500]  That would be my gut.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.500]  You still seem like very influential in the same circles
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.500]  you were influential in five years ago,
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500]  but maybe it's a smaller pie.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.500]  Yeah, I think it's something like that, you know,
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.500]  and I think that if you polled people and said,
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500]  who's influential writing about Apple?
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.500]  I probably do better now than I did then,
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:20.500]  but I have fewer page views per month than I did then.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500]  And I think it just all hits on an argument.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.500]  Everybody does, right?
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.500]  Right.
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:30.500]  And it fits very well with my career-long argument
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.500]  that page views are a terrible way to measure anything
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:39.500]  other than how busy your version of Apache is.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500]  I don't know.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.500]  Do people still use Apache?
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.500]  I use Apache.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.500]  Imagine.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.500]  Apache?
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.500]  I don't know.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500]  You don't even know if Apache's out.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500]  But think about something like, and again,
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500]  you always got to give me a little bit of a pass.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500]  I don't follow all this stuff super carefully.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.500]  I read your site.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.500]  I read Six Colors.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.500]  I read iMore and Mac World.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.500]  I'm not an Apple follower.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.500]  I'm a user.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.500]  I'm a super user, but I don't follow the business.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.500]  But with that said, I mean, could you have guessed,
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.500]  what, four years ago that Mark Gurman would have risen
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500]  in a sentence the way that he has?
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.500]  No.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500]  That still feels like a story that's not done being told.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.500]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.500]  I mean, I've noticed, I feel like I've noticed a change
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500]  in how you talk or think about him.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500]  Didn't you have him on the show one time?
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.500]  At least once, maybe twice.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.500]  I think it was twice.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.500]  At least once, but wasn't there a time when you,
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.500]  well, I'll put it this way, I would lump all of those idiots
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500]  into the same group of who cares,
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500]  why are you talking about rumor stuff?
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:41.500]  But he has been, it seems to me, unique in his ability
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.500]  to get to the right sources that he is true,
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.500]  he does know about stuff before other people,
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.500]  and he finds a way to make it into a story
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.500]  in a way that a lot of other folks haven't,
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500]  where it doesn't really just feel like a blown-up forum site
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.500]  about rumors, you know what I mean?
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.500]  I think he's changed that particular game a little bit.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.500]  Oh, definitely.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.500]  What do you think about that?
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.500]  So I've had him on twice.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.500]  I had him on last June.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:03.500]  He seems like a pretty smart guy.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500]  And then I had him, when this show,
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.500]  this incarnation of the show was hosted over at Mule,
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:14.500]  he was on episode 79 in 2014.
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:20.500]  Yeah, you know, and I, he's the most successful rumor,
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.500]  Apple rumor reporter ever, in my opinion,
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.500]  just in terms that it seems like a gig that burns people out.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500]  But also just the fact that he seems to be,
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500]  he gets good information,
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.500]  what seems like a lot more often than other people.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500]  I mean, I don't care whether he has the most popular site,
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.500]  it's just that the accuracy of what he's gotten right,
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.500]  not just by throwing a million darts at the board,
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.500]  but by saying this, this, this, and this,
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.500]  and most of that's true,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500]  I think it would be hard to argue
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.500]  that he's been the most successful
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.500]  in terms of track record.
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.500]  Yeah, he's definitely not a darts-at-the-board
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.500]  type of person, you know, which is to say
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.500]  that what if you predict anything and everything,
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:03.500]  and then, you know, one of them is bound to hit,
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500]  and then you're good.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.500]  Do you ever hear about this?
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.500]  Somebody told me about,
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500]  I think our friend Paul Kefasis told me about this
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500]  a couple of weeks ago that,
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500]  I guess I'll have to put it in the show notes and find it,
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.500]  but during the last Soccer World Cup,
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.500]  which I guess was, what, like two years ago,
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:24.500]  somebody, what they did is,
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.500]  they started pointing to these tweets
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:33.500]  from this account that was called, like, FIFA Corruption.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.500]  FIFA is the world soccer organization.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.500]  Right, that's the Sepp Blatter guy?
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.500]  Yeah, well, so these tweets had all the scores
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500]  in advance of the games.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.500]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:51.500]  And it was like, Germany will beat Sweden 2-1,
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.500]  and, you know, so-and-so kicks a goal late,
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:59.500]  you know, in extra time to break the 1-1 tie.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:03.500]  And the timestamp on the tweet is before the game,
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500]  and here, that's exactly what happened.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500]  And it went super viral.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500]  It was like, holy shit, this guy,
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.500]  whoever this anonymous person tweeting these things in is,
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.500]  you know, all of his tweets are exactly right,
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:19.500]  and they're all, you know, they've all got the scores right.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500]  So it's obviously these matches are all fixed.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500]  But what the guy did, it was brilliant,
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.500]  was he tweeted, like, hundreds and hundreds of tweets
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:31.500]  with all sorts of, and soccer scores aren't that hard to get.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500]  Yeah, it's not going to be like 135-7.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500]  Right, it's, you know.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500]  It's going to be 3-2-1-0.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.500]  So he tweeted hundreds and hundreds of these tweets
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.500]  with these possible things,
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500]  very plausible things that would happen,
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.500]  and hadn't publicized the Twitter account at all,
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:50.500]  then went and deleted all the ones that didn't come true,
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.500]  leaving only the ones that happened,
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.500]  and then started publicizing the Twitter account.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.500]  Well, that's the way a lot of rumor blogging works,
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500]  and Germin definitely isn't that style.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500]  I mean, you can't go back and delete it,
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.500]  but, you know, certainly these financial analysts and stuff like that,
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  they do it all the time.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500]  They'll say, you know, ten different things.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.500]  Nine of them are ridiculous, but one of them hit,
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500]  and then they just point to the one that hit, and they're like, see?
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500]  Yeah, that's so interesting when you think of it that way,
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.500]  and there are reputations that end up getting made that,
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500]  it's almost like, you know,
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.500]  imagine if you had to sit down in a Google spreadsheet,
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.500]  and, you know, remember there was that website for a while
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500]  where you could make a bet about anything that would happen in the future,
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500]  and, you know, I forget what that was called,
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:35.500]  but the idea is the artfulness is coming up with what actually constitutes the bet.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.500]  Like, you can't say, like, oh, computers will get faster within the next year.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.500]  Like, okay, thanks, that doesn't really help us.
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.500]  You had to have something very specific and quantifiable.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.500]  If you were, and obviously you would never be this person
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.500]  if you're a rumor monger, but, like, if you had to, like, make that,
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.500]  say that by this date, the following kind of thing will happen.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500]  My level of certainty is this much,
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500]  and basically the number of chips I'll put on the table is this much, right?
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.500]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.500]  Like, I'm, like, I'm going to give this a, you know,
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.500]  five out of ten on how much I'm pretty sure it's going to happen,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500]  and I'm going to bet this many chips that it would happen,
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.500]  so it's sort of like odds.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.500]  You know, it would be really interesting to go back over somebody's career
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500]  and be able to look at those.
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:16.500]  I bet it would be, especially for some of these ding-a-ling analysts,
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.500]  can you imagine what that would be like?
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.500]  And not just your trip-childry types, but, like, just any of these folks out there
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.500]  who have some kind of speculative half-reckon about something that might happen.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.500]  It's like doing a cold reading, you know?
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.500]  Like, you know, you walk up to anybody who can speak English and say,
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.500]  do you have an uneasy feeling about an older man in your life right now?
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.500]  It's like, almost everybody does.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500]  It would be kind of like going,
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.500]  I almost feel like you might be slightly more intelligent
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:44.500]  than a lot of the people around you.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.500]  I'm like, oh, yeah, actually I do.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.500]  Oh, interesting, interesting, interesting.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.500]  Have you had a loss in your life in the last, you know?
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.500]  That's the kind of thing where it really feels like a cold reading
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.500]  to just some of this stuff.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.500]  You know, Apple's going to make a bigger phone.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.500]  Apple's going to make a smaller phone.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:02.500]  Well, congratulations.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.500]  You just covered the entire board.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.500]  Like, thanks.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.500]  That's great.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500]  That's really useful.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.500]  You know what?
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:11.500]  It reminds me of a very specific rumor that is somewhat recent,
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:16.500]  super widespread, and I wanted to bring it up with you.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500]  I didn't write it down.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.500]  I kept it in my head, but now I remember.
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.500]  Otherwise, I would have forgotten it.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500]  I'm fascinated by this rumor that the next iPhone
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500]  is going to get rid of the headphone jack.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.500]  Yeah, me too.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.500]  Not particularly because of the practical consequences of living
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.500]  with an iPhone that doesn't have a standard headphone jack,
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.500]  but the way that tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.500]  of people have reacted to the news.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500]  Right.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500]  There's a petition that somebody put together that apparently,
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.500]  and everybody knows how effective online petitions are.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:52.500]  Especially for things that haven't been announced as a reality yet.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.500]  Right.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.500]  It's like being mad about a speculative change of wardrobe
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.500]  by the cartoon character Tinkerbell.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.500]  It's like, well, that's not anything we actually thought about,
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.500]  but sure, give us your petition.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500]  So what are people saying?
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500]  What is the nature of their demand?
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  That they not get rid of the audio jack or what's the specific beef?
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.500]  To me, that's what's interesting.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.500]  The ramifications, not to cut you off there,
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.500]  but the ramifications of this are extremely interesting
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.500]  because there are a lot of things that this will screw up,
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.500]  a lot of things that it will allow,
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500]  and just a whole bunch of stuff that it'll change,
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500]  and it all comes down to these little implementation details
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.500]  to what this means in the near term,
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500]  and I find that incredibly fascinating.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.500]  Here it is.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:40.500]  It's an online petition that has 291,848 signees,
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:46.500]  and their goal is 300,000, so they're actually a little short of their goal.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.500]  Here, I'll send you a link.
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.500]  I'll just read it to you, though.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.500]  This is the way the petition reads.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:58.500]  I think it's very...
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500]  I think the way it's read...
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.500]  I try to use my voice to put the bold.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500]  There's a lot of bold.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.500]  Oh, my goodness, there is.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.500]  Apple is about...
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.500]  Maybe you should read it.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:17.500]  Apple is about to rip off every one of its customers again.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500]  Forbes and Fast Company are reporting that
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.500]  Apple plans to ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone jack
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500]  when it releases iPhone 7 later this year.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500]  Only a massive...
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500]  Who are these people?
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500]  Have they finished high school?
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:35.500]  Only a massive international campaign could force Apple to change course now.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.500]  Really? Is that the only thing that can cause it to happen?
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.500]  That seems like a very odd thing to just guess.
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500]  Oh, my God, this is horrible.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.500]  Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.500]  to replace their Hi-Fi headphones,
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.500]  it will single-handedly create mountains of electronic waste
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:55.500]  that likely won't get recycled after an M-Dash?
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.500]  According to the United Nations, up to 90% of this...
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.500]  Oh, my God, this is so horrible.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500]  And further down, this is right out of the Apple corporate playbook.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.500]  Did you know that, John?
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500]  Did you know that they have a corporate playbook
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500]  out of which things are right taken?
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.500]  A few years ago, it swapped out the original...
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.500]  Sounds like John Rock recruited.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.500]  Except John would never write this poorly.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500]  A few years ago, it swapped out the original iPod dock connector
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:24.500]  with a new one making countless cords, cables, and chargers obsolete.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:28.500]  Further down, tell Apple to keep the standard headphone jack
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.500]  and ditch planned obsolescence, exclamation point.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500]  So I find it fascinating.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]  This is incredible.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.500]  I do realize that if it's true that the headphone jack goes away,
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.500]  that it will be an inconvenience to people who have purchased
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:47.500]  third-party headphones, and the more expensive they are,
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500]  the more inconvenient it might be.
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500]  Does it have to be an inconvenience?
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500]  Well, I mean, you have to have an adapter or something like that,
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.500]  and the adapter's going to stick out further than it did before.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500]  I mean, it's, you know...
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.500]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, this has not been announced yet.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.500]  There's no way to know.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.500]  This is one of those classic examples
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.500]  of taking something that isn't a thing yet,
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.500]  taking even...
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:15.500]  You begin with the idea of something that's not a thing yet,
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.500]  guess two orders of change away from that
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.500]  until you find something that makes you infuriated.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.500]  And so where people are extremely angry about something that hasn't happened.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.500]  So I don't know.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500]  I guess I just feel like...
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.500]  I think it is interesting,
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:33.500]  because it could mean lots of different stuff for the company,
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500]  but if you watch Apple at all,
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.500]  and I'm not even saying this will happen,
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.500]  but if it does happen, I don't think this would be surprising at all,
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.500]  especially given how much they want slimness,
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.500]  and given how much they might want this added functionality.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:46.500]  I don't think they're doing it to make you buy new headphones.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.500]  I think they're doing it because I think that's the future rather than the past.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.500]  Right, and implicit in this line of argument
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.500]  is the idea that they should never get rid of this headphone port,
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.500]  and that devices that we buy 20, 30, 40 years from now
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500]  should still have the same headphone port,
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.500]  because at any given point,
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:09.500]  if every device that could have headphones uses the same port,
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500]  there's never going to be a year where it's like,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.500]  well, now's the year when nobody's going to be put to any inconvenience whatsoever by this.
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:23.500]  And the fact that they make mention of the 30-pin to Lightning adapter thing is,
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:28.500]  to me, it's like the people who signed this are still upset about that one.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.500]  It's like, yes, that was an inconvenience,
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500]  and I know, just from talking to people,
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.500]  one of the scenarios where that was really inconvenient would be like,
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:43.500]  let's say that maybe you and your spouse are on every-other-year schedules getting new phones.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500]  You each get one every two years,
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.500]  but one year for one, one year for the other.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:54.500]  So there was a year there where one of the household members had the old iPhone port,
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.500]  and the other had the new one.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.500]  It was the worst for a while, yeah.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:02.500]  And so it's not just as simple unless everybody in the house switches at once.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.500]  It's not as simple as just, well, just buy a couple of the new ones and leave them around.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.500]  But if there's a charger in the kitchen or something like that,
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:11.500]  well, now you've got to have a dongle or something.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.500]  But give it a couple of years to work itself out.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:17.500]  And now it's a better world because we have a better port.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.500]  It's smaller. It works bi-directionally.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:24.500]  In hindsight, it's like, wow, that really worked out well.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.500]  Well, let me ask you an extremely carefully worded question,
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:30.500]  or ask our listeners an extremely carefully worded question.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:36.500]  How many of you out there are using headphones that you bought over five years ago
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:40.500]  that you still use several times a week,
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:45.500]  and do you intend to keep using them for the next two years?
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.500]  Let's even say the next year.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.500]  How about this?
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.500]  Headphones you bought in the last four years that you still use more than one time a week,
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.500]  several times a week, maybe are there any that you bought over four years ago
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.500]  that you're using every day with an iPhone?
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500]  And do you intend to use that for another year?
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.500]  Because here's the thing.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.500]  That's when the Lightning Adapter came out, was four years ago.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.500]  Do you follow?
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:11.500]  In the amount of time since the Lightning Adapter has come out,
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:20.500]  I am not finding it difficult to deal with not having a 30-pin USB jack anymore.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.500]  It just doesn't come up.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.500]  It comes up a couple times a week, maybe, or maybe even less,
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.500]  because I have to charge my kids ancient iPad 2.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:32.500]  But that transition is well and truly over,
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.500]  with the exception of maybe going into a hotel room
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.500]  and finding some places that still have those.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.500]  Do you see my point, though?
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.500]  So what's the legacy problem here?
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.500]  Do you personally have any headphones that you couldn't afford to replace
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500]  that you've used for more than four years
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500]  and need to use for more than the next year or so?
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.500]  Because it's going to be at least a year, I'm going to guess, until that happens.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:57.500]  So to me, it all falls apart already because it's not like getting your dad's Rolex.
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:00.500]  We're talking about headphones that people probably buy every couple years anyway.
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.500]  Yeah, and boy, an awful lot of people.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:06.500]  I know, and it's nice at this point where we've got, I don't know,
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:13.500]  I think if you did a thorough combing of our household
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:18.500]  and counted up all of the pairs of White Apple earbuds that are in this house,
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.500]  I would not be surprised if the number of working pairs of them
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:28.500]  was at least, I don't know, 12, maybe more, maybe like 15, 20.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.500]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500]  And it's nice, therefore.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:35.500]  I've got a pair here at my desk, and I think I've been using these for a while.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500]  Those are just my emergency travel headphones.
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.500]  I hate them. I hate them.
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.500]  They fit my ears pretty well, so I use them.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:45.500]  Amy doesn't really like them but uses them.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:49.500]  And Jonas just goes, Jonas likes them a lot, so Jonas uses them.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.500]  But it's nice if you misplace a pair, you just find another pair, you pick it in.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.500]  So it'll be a pain, yes, you'll get a new iPhone, presumably,
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.500]  unless they go, who knows what they're going to do?
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.500]  That's the other thing that makes me so crazy about the,
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:05.500]  or not crazy, but so, like, what's wrong with you people?
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500]  We haven't heard the story yet.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.500]  If it's true, we haven't even heard what Apple expects us to do.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500]  Are they going to go entirely wireless?
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:18.500]  Is it a new thing? Is it going to be the Lightning port?
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.500]  Let's just say, though, that they do include a pair of wired headphones
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500]  and they plug into the Lightning port.
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.500]  Yes, it'll be mildly inconvenient that, like, the 15 pairs of headphones
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:29.500]  in the house already no longer work on this phone
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500]  and you have to use the one that came with your phone.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500]  But they're going to give you a pair of headphones that work.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.500]  They're going to give you a pair of headphones that work,
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:39.500]  and knowing Apple, I mean, Apple has been fairly consistent about this.
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.500]  Personally, I call it the one-year warning shot,
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.500]  which is that Apple will give you, if you're looking for it,
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.500]  you will notice a warning shot about what's going to go away in a year
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:48.500]  if you're paying attention.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.500]  That could be all kinds of different devices,
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.500]  but the classic for me is the scrolling direction.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:56.500]  I said, okay, from now on, we're changing the scrolling direction on OS X.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.500]  It's going to seem weird, but that's going to be, you know, here's the thing.
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.500]  If it absolutely drives you crazy,
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.500]  you can go back and change it to the other way, like an animal.
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.500]  But we want you to know that, like, this is the way we're moving,
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500]  and if you want to move in the direction Apple is moving,
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500]  I'm not saying this is good, bad, or indifferent,
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500]  you need to listen for those warning shots and in the next year
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500]  get your head around the fact that this is going to change.
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.500]  So yes, I think they will give you, if this is the change,
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.500]  and I don't think there's evidence that there is, but whatever,
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.500]  if there is, they're going to give you the right headphones.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.500]  And you know what, I'll bet you,
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500]  you can find some kind of janky-ass adapter
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:29.500]  that will let you use your beloved headphones.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:33.500]  But I don't think, I think if they do this,
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500]  it's not going to be because it makes your life miserable,
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500]  it's because they want to do something really new.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500]  And that to me is super interesting.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.500]  What could you do with lightning headphones?
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.500]  There's so many things that are super interesting to me in thinking about that.
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.500]  I mean, I'm thinking also about stuff like,
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.500]  could you have, let's say you had a charger pack,
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.500]  would it be conceivable to have a charger pack that had
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.500]  just a slightly larger than usual chin on it,
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:58.500]  where you could potentially plug that into the lightning
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.500]  and then have both the transmitter and off to the side
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.500]  a dingus for plugging in old-style headphones?
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.500]  I mean, that's not beyond imagination.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.500]  Sure, you could do it.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.500]  What would an adapter look like, you think?
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.500]  Well, I mean, it might just be, just a straight adapter
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.500]  would just be like a little, you know.
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500]  On a cord, probably.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500]  Yeah, maybe it would be on a cord.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500]  Otherwise you're going to get that iPad Pro pencil problem
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.500]  if you've got this, for the full-on long iPhone jack,
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500]  that's going to be pretty long,
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500]  accounting for what's already inside the phone.
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500]  Yeah, maybe it should be on a little cord.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500]  Because that way, in a little cord,
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500]  if it was on like a little like, you know,
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.500]  two-inch cable, then it wouldn't be like
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.500]  a crisp, breaky, offy thing in your pocket.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500]  Like the size of one of those splitters,
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500]  like where you want to split into two
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500]  and you get two separate cords coming out,
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500]  something along those lines.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500]  That would fix the legacy problem.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500]  Is it elegant? No, but welcome to the future.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500]  Like, you're going to buy new headphones anyway,
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500]  especially, I don't know.
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:03.500]  We're either going to use this old 3.5mm port forever.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500]  Forever.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500]  Infinite timescale.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500]  Or, eventually, somebody is going to ship a product
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.500]  that doesn't use it.
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:12.500]  And so, I don't get it.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.500]  I really do enjoy, though.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:15.500]  So, here's the thing, though.
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500]  I really do wonder, if it's true,
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.500]  I wonder if this actually is a rare case,
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:24.500]  in my opinion, of a deliberate leak by Apple
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.500]  to vent a whole bunch of the anger
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.500]  almost an entire year in advance
[01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.500]  so that when it is announced,
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.500]  it will come as a shock to nearly as many people.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:39.500]  Who has done the most significant
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500]  and reliable reporting, or, you know,
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:44.500]  apparently reliable reporting on this?
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:47.500]  I guess the guy at Fast Company.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.500]  I guess, and notably not Germin.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.500]  Or Forbes, maybe?
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.500]  Yeah, Forbes and Fast Company is what the petition says.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.500]  Although, they don't...
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.500]  Oh, no, they do have links to it at the bottom.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.500]  So, if you go to that petition page...
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.500]  I don't think Forbes will let me look at their page anymore.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500]  iPhone 7 leaks, quote,
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.500]  confirm Apple abandoning headphone jack.
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:13.500]  Oh, my God, it's like they've got a different dictionary.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500]  Exactly.
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:19.500]  Well, they did put the word confirm in quotes.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500]  That's great. That's great.
[01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.500]  That's just a little better than putting proves
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.500]  in quotation marks.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:29.500]  It's like reality, but maybe not.
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500]  The Fast Company headline is,
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.500]  it's true, colon, Apple will drop headphone jack
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.500]  to make the iPhone 7 slimmer, comma, says source.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500]  I would say that the Fast Company one
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500]  is probably the most reliable.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500]  Okay, so I didn't exactly ask you this.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500]  Do you think this will happen?
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500]  I do.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500]  Because I feel like it has to happen eventually,
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500]  and so why not now?
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500]  Okay.
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500]  What are some of the benefits?
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500]  The most obvious one, apparently,
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500]  is that it is the gating factor
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500]  for getting the phone any thinner.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500]  Well, maybe.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500]  The counterargument to that is that
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500]  the current iPod touches
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:12.500]  are significantly thinner than the iPhone,
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.500]  the current iPhone,
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.500]  and they still have the standard headphone jack,
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.500]  and there are iPods,
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:25.500]  regular non-iOS iPods that are even thinner still
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:28.500]  have that port.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.500]  But on the iPods that are thinner,
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.500]  that have that port,
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:35.500]  there's a chin area where the inserted part
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500]  of the headphone jack
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:41.500]  doesn't actually go underneath the display,
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500]  which makes it easier engineering-wise.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.500]  On the iPod Touch, it does.
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:49.500]  You could make a significantly thinner iPhone
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500]  and keep this port,
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500]  but without question,
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500]  every port you remove
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.500]  has got to make the device smaller and lighter.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:00.500]  Yeah.
[01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.500]  It seems like there's several.
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.500]  I'm not an engineer, obviously.
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.500]  It's common sense, though,
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.500]  that if you just take the port out
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.500]  and don't even replace it with another port of any kind...
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.500]  Every dingus you can take off of there,
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.500]  it could mean all kinds of things.
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.500]  It means more space to do anything with that area,
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.500]  including what components you can put there in its place.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:20.500]  Also, we're talking about at least, what,
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.500]  three-quarters of an inch of depth.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.500]  Aside from this thing that's already got that depth accounted for?
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500]  I actually think if you could pick the brains
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:30.500]  of a hardware engineer at Apple
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:33.500]  who works specifically on these problems of
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.500]  how do we cram all the stuff we absolutely need
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:38.500]  and get the biggest possible battery that we can,
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.500]  given the insane thinness
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500]  that Johnny Ive's team is saying
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500]  we're supposed to build this at,
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.500]  I would bet that if you talk to one of the engineers
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.500]  who works on that,
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:53.500]  here's what Johnny's team says we're supposed to be able to build.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500]  How do we make this reality?
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.500]  That the depth of the jack into the device
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:00.500]  is actually a bigger problem
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:03.500]  than the 3.5 millimeter diameter.
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500]  As well as, I don't know electronics,
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.500]  but as well as, I'm guessing,
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:10.500]  being one of the most difficult parts in terms of moisture.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.500]  The lightning, I don't know, I feel like...
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:16.500]  Did I talk to you about my weird lightning thing last year?
[01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:19.500]  Where one particular pin on my lightning cable
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:22.500]  had turned like a bluish green
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.500]  on all of my chargers?
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.500]  No!
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.500]  The exact same pin on both sides.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.500]  And I wondered if it was a hardware virus.
[01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.500]  But basically, and then all of a sudden
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.500]  all my devices weren't charging as well.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.500]  And it looked like basically an aquamarine...
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500]  Is that the kind of dark blue-green?
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.500]  Like a dark blue-green crayon
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500]  had been very lightly smudged on the same pin
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.500]  of six different lightning jacks.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500]  Isn't that insane?
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500]  But it must, I'll bet the problem must have been with the device.
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.500]  That you had a device where the internal pin...
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.500]  What caused what is the question?
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.500]  Do you remember Jeff Veen talking about the hardware virus at Google?
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.500]  Did you ever hear about that?
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.500]  No, I don't think I have.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:03.500]  I love this story.
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500]  They had a hardware virus.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500]  I'm going to give you a minute to mull that over in your head.
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.500]  They had a hardware virus at Google.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:13.500]  Where basically people's DVI
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.500]  jack, what do you call the female on the laptop?
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.500]  The jack?
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:18.500]  I think that's the jack.
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.500]  People's DVI jacks stopped working.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.500]  The ports, sorry.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500]  The ports stopped working.
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500]  And they all had this same...
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:26.500]  They appeared to all...
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.500]  People would notice that they would go and they'd plug into the projector.
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:29.500]  It didn't work.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500]  They'd go and look.
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.500]  And this one pin had gotten like kind of
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.500]  basically bent and distorted inside
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:39.500]  all these different people's laptops.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.500]  And so that you would go and if you were in whatever room you were in,
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.500]  you'd look at the plug and that plug was messed up.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.500]  Your laptop is messed up.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.500]  Suddenly everybody's noticing all the laptops and all the plugs are messed up.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500]  And you can figure out why, right?
[01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:54.500]  It all started with one slide projector having a broken pin
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:58.500]  and passing that defect onto any piece of hardware it plugged into.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:03.500]  And then consequently, each piece of hardware that plugged into that computer
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.500]  then got it too, which would then pass it on to everybody else.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.500]  That's insane.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.500]  It's incredible.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.500]  What an amazing idea.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.500]  I've never heard of that before.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.500]  And now it's kind of amazing it doesn't happen more often.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:15.500]  So that was my first thought.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500]  Isn't that how Skynet started?
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500]  Is that the one in Robocop?
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:20.500]  Terminator.
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:21.500]  Oh, sorry.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.500]  That's right.
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:25.500]  That's how that started.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:29.500]  So I don't know much about that.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.500]  You know what's funny?
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.500]  I can't believe I'm living in an age where my phone feels too thin
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.500]  and my Touch ID seems too fast.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.500]  When I take the naked robotic core out of the leather case
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:40.500]  and I hold it in my hand, I have to tell you,
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:44.500]  my 6S Prime feels a little too thin.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:46.500]  It's not that comfortable to me.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.500]  I don't think I'd want it to be any thinner.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.500]  Yeah, well.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:53.500]  And right now I want to see if I have any messages.
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:58.500]  I use my pinky now because I want to be able to see the lock screen
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.500]  before it turns on.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.500]  It's so impossibly fast now.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:03.500]  Could you ever imagine that that would be something a grown man would bitch about?
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.500]  Yeah.
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.500]  It still gets me when I want to take a photo.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:09.500]  Something is happening like, oh my God, I've got to get a picture of this.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.500]  I developed the habit a few years ago when they added the feature
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.500]  where there's a camera shortcut on the lock screen.
[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:16.500]  Just swipe up.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:17.500]  Remembering that.
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:22.500]  When I'm normally using the phone, I'm getting better at it.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.500]  If I really do want to see the lock screen,
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:29.500]  I know to use the side button to wake it up instead of the fingerprint button.
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.500]  Oh, that's good.
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:33.500]  Yeah, but when I'm in that emergency, holy cow,
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:38.500]  there's a squirrel eating a duck.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.500]  Yeah, there's a squirrel eating a duck.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.500]  I don't have time to think.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.500]  I have to think to use that side button.
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:47.500]  I just instantly go to the home button.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500]  That's like muscle reflex.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.500]  And now I'm looking around for, oh man.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.500]  Yeah, and now it's like my Twitter client is open and I'm like,
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500]  oh, look, it's on Twitter.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500]  You start shaking like an old man.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:02.500]  You're like, oh, wait a minute, I want to get back to the screen I was on.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.500]  By the way, I'm thinking about writing about this,
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.500]  but I actually looked up.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.500]  I had the same problem you just went through verbally a minute or two ago there
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.500]  about the word jack, and when you talk about the headphone jack,
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.500]  is the jack the male or is it the female?
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.500]  It ends up, here's the dictionary definition.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:20.500]  Oh, good, good, good.
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:26.500]  A socket with two or more pairs of terminals designed to receive a jack plug.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:29.500]  So it is the female, but in the dictionary,
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:33.500]  this is the Apple dictionary, which is like American heritage or something,
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:37.500]  they describe it as needing two or more pairs of terminals.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:40.500]  So I feel like the dictionary is wrong on that case
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.500]  because it doesn't seem like they have a definition
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:48.500]  that would work with headphone jack where there's just one terminal.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.500]  That's jack or socket?
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.500]  Jack, J-A-C-K, jack.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:58.500]  A socket with two or more pairs of terminals designed to receive a jack plug.
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:01.500]  So that's the female headphone dingus, is the jack?
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.500]  They're saying that the female...
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.500]  They should call that a jill.
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.500]  They should. I've thought of that.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.500]  It does seem like maybe the jack...
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.500]  Am I right?
[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500]  What about airplane fluid?
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500]  Socket, jack.
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:18.500]  So they're saying it's a jack is the socket and the jack plug is the plug.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:21.500]  Oh, okay.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:24.500]  Then what do you call the pig face thing that you get
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.500]  110 electricity out of in your house?
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.500]  Is that an outlet? You call that an outlet?
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:31.500]  I would normally call it an outlet, but I might call it...
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:34.500]  When you jack your plug into the socket, you call that an outlet?
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.500]  Yeah, I might call it a jack casually.
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.500]  I would prefer to call it a jack because I feel like jack is a pretty good word.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500]  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:44.500]  I feel like with headphones and casual speaking,
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500]  it doesn't make any logical sense,
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.500]  but you can kind of get away with calling the male and the female a jack.
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:53.500]  If you've got your headphones, just take the jack and plug it into the jack.
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:55.500]  Jack into the jack.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:57.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:00.500]  Take the headphone jack and just plug it right into the jack on your phone.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:09.500]  What do you make of the apparent obsession with increasing thinness?
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.500]  What do you make of that?
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:15.500]  I mean, when I say what do you make of that, do you like that?
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.500]  Do you feel that it is useful and important?
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:21.500]  And why in particular do you think it seems like such an obsession
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.500]  inside the white room to make things thinner?
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:27.500]  Is that a thing? Because it feels like a thing.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.500]  I don't know anybody.
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.500]  I can't think of anybody I know who's top of the list,
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.500]  even their top five, would be I want a thinner phone.
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.500]  Pretty much everybody I know says I would.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.500]  And who knows? This could be at cross purposes,
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.500]  like with your thinking fast mind and your thinking slow mind.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.500]  But everybody I know says they would like to get more battery.
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.500]  I don't know anybody that says I want a thinner phone.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.500]  I asked Schiller about that when he was on the show at WWDC,
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.500]  and he gave a good answer.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.500]  And at least at the time I was like, damn, that's a good answer.
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:58.500]  And damned if I can remember it.
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:02.500]  I was backstage. I was backstage drinking. I don't remember.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.500]  Damned if I can remember it.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.500]  I don't know. I don't know what to make of it.
[01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:10.500]  Because it's gone past the point where I care.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:16.500]  I'm impressed now when I go to one of these Apple events
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:19.500]  and it's the year when you get a new form factor
[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.500]  and then they have them on an Apple table backstage
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:25.500]  and you get to touch them and see how thin they are.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:27.500]  And it's like, wow, that is thin.
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:33.500]  But I think, honestly, I don't think that the thinness of the thing
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.500]  has ever really mattered to me.
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:38.500]  I liked the original iPhone. I didn't think it was too thick.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:43.500]  And I think starting somewhere around the 4.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:47.500]  Yeah, the 4 and the 4S. The one that had the glass back.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:49.500]  The glass front, glass back.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:54.500]  That's still my favorite. The 4S is still my favorite form factor.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:00.500]  At that point, I thought, this is fantastic.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.500]  This feels so great in my pocket. This is great.
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.500]  And then when they made the next one even thinner,
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.500]  I was like, wow, that's amazing.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.500]  But I didn't think this is better for me.
[01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:14.500]  They could have stopped at the thinness of the 4, 4S
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.500]  and I'd be happy if they just packed it with battery.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.500]  Well, I don't want to sound like an idiot.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.500]  Obviously, I'm glad to see enhancements to the phone.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.500]  I like that it's faster. I like that it's bigger. It's all that kind of stuff.
[01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:28.500]  But to me, the 4S design, the whole chamfered edges or whatever they called it,
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.500]  that still feels so classic to me.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.500]  No, that was the 5 and 5S.
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:33.500]  Was that the 5 and the 5S?
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.500]  Yeah.
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:35.500]  What was the 4?
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.500]  That was the one that had the glass back.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.500]  And it just had metal sides.
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.500]  It wasn't chamfered, though.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:47.500]  Oh, right. Yeah, I guess in my head I think of the  yes, I see what you're saying.
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:51.500]  Yeah, but I still think of that as like  I'll remember that as the classic iPhone look, I think.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.500]  Yeah.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:55.500]  I don't know. I like the rounded-ish edges.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500]  Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I misspoke.
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  Yeah, this one looks like a Mophie before there was a Mophie, right?
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.500]  It's got that metal edge. Was this the antenna gate phone?
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:04.500]  Yes.
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:08.500]  Yeah, right. God, I'm looking at just what the OS looked like. Oh, my goodness.
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.500]  Oh, my gosh, it's so  I don't hate it, though.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.500]  I don't hate it.
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:16.500]  I'm not going to blanket party on forestall. I think  I don't know, man.
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:21.500]  It's when the iPhone got good. He was still there running the show.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:25.500]  So thinness  yeah, so I don't know. I don't know.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:31.500]  Again, I have to always in my head discount the fact that the way that we  you know that book I'm talking about,
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.500]  the Kahneman book, Thinking Fast and Slow?
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.500]  Yeah.
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:35.500]  Yeah, it's an amazing book.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.500]  But there are the ways that when we stop and think and meta-think about what we're doing,
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:42.500]  that's actually very different from the way that we think from day to day.
[01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:46.500]  It's  there's just  I mean setting aside the research, there's just the anecdotes,
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:50.500]  there's so much stuff about like what we think we want versus what we actually do
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:53.500]  and what we actually use and how we actually process information.
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:59.500]  If you ask anyone who's a gambler whether gambling is a good way to make lots of money and you say to them 
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.500]  they will say no, it's not. It's dumb that I do this. It's dumb that I drink. It's dumb that I gamble.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.500]  It's dumb that I do these things. It doesn't change the fact that we still do it.
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:12.500]  So I have to guess that there's something going on and on a sub rosa level here where they are 
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  there's some reason that they are making these things the way they are making them
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:20.500]  and it may not exactly comport with the way that my brain thinks that these things should be made.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500]  But they must have their reasons, right?
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:27.500]  That's what I try to think. I try to remain unemotional about it.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:29.500]  Like I don't see it and I don't get it.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:33.500]  But I feel like it's of a part with the outrage over the headphone jack.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.500]  Yes.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:40.500]  Where I don't want to be the one who's outraged that they've made this  the next iPhone even thinner
[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:47.500]  and the battery life isn't any better when obviously if they had kept it the same thickness
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.500]  and just added a little more battery, they could have made battery better.
[01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:59.500]  That sounds better to me and I know that there's these literal laws of physics that affect image quality of the camera
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:04.500]  where the longer the distance you have between the lens and the sensor, it helps to have a bigger 
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:08.500]  you can have a bigger sensor with bigger pixels and therefore get better image quality.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:12.500]  I understand that. I don't get it.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:17.500]  It seems to me  my look at it as common sense is if they kept the thinness the same at this point,
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.500]  then they could have more battery which would increase battery life
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:25.500]  and they could have better image quality on the camera which are like the two things that I care about most.
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:30.500]  There's using the camera and the battery and they keep  instead they keep making it thinner.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:34.500]  I don't get it but I don't assume that there's no good reason for it
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:41.500]  or that the only reason is like Johnny Ive's personal obsession with the thinness.
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.500]  I get that there must be something. I just don't see it.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:52.500]  Right, right. And I think for folks who are technologically inclined, scientifically inclined or even rationally inclined,
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:56.500]  you might want to look at something like in this case the thinness of the phone
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:53:00.500]  and you can come up with half a dozen reasons why making it thinner is not a good idea
[01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:03.500]  or is not the first good idea.
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:08.500]  But at the same time, you could look at stuff like the skeuomorphism that goes into automobiles
[01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:14.500]  in terms of like making this sporty wheel look even more sporty than it needs to look for the sportiness of it.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.500]  Does that actually help make it a better car?
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:21.500]  Not in the usual sense but it makes it more attractive to people.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:25.500]  Having it create more  like making it make more engine noise than it needs to make.
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:30.500]  Does that make it a better car? Not really, not in an engineering sense but there's a reason.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.500]  There's reasons for all of this stuff.
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:36.500]  It goes beyond simply fashion but there's something about like when you're using it,
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:41.500]  this makes you feel a certain way and that's why people keep going back and buying these same brands over and over.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.500]  Dino?
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:49.500]  Yeah, I'll try to channel my inner Siracusa here and I feel like Siracusa, if he's listening,
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:53.500]  is champing at the bit here because I feel like he could explain this best.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:59.500]  But like the end result eventually is that these phones are just going to be pieces of glass.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:02.500]  You know like  remember, did you see the movie Looper?
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.500]  Yeah, like those are basically  it's like  or even in like Parks and Rec.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:09.500]  It's basically going to be like a  it'll be like a clear, like a floating screen kind of thing.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:16.500]  Yeah, it's just the piece of glass or maybe it's not glass, maybe it's a polycarbonate but just the screen.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:21.500]  And when it's off, maybe it's even translucent and everything is built into it.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:27.500]  To get from here to there, they have to keep making everything thinner and that they know that that's where it's going
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:33.500]  and in the meantime, they have to keep pressing the gas pedal on making these things thinner
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:39.500]  even though it's at the expense of trying to also  it's working counter to making battery life better
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.500]  and counter to making the camera better.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:46.500]  They have to keep working on all three because that's inevitable and if they don't do it, somebody else will.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:52.500]  Because we're still thinking about a power device as relying on the kind of power with the kind of constraints that we do right now.
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.500]  In the same way, like think about the leap from CRT to LED.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:02.500]  Like, I mean, making that mental model, that leap from what a TV is, what a TV looks like,
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:14.500]  how is it that within like less than 10 years, you went from a TV being what, an 80-pound box into being almost like a plane, right?
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:19.500]  I mean, but that takes an entire quantum leap whereas if you ever opened up a TV or opened up a stereo,
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.500]  like a crappily made stereo system, it's all air inside.
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:26.500]  There's no reason for any of that. It's just cheapest to make that way with stock components.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500]  So that's kind of what you're saying, right?
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:35.500]  Like, if we look at this as more than one axis changing in the future, you can't help but think that there's going to be some evolutions we don't in the near-term under
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500]  not evolutions but changes we don't immediately understand.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:45.500]  Yeah. I also wonder if there might not be a very practical near-term product marketing angle on it,
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:54.500]  which is that Apple and other companies as well might know that if they made the device
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:58.500]  let's just say that the iPhone 7 coming out is the new iPhone is called the iPhone 7.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:03.500]  It's coming out later this year and it's thinner than the iPhone 6.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:09.500]  That's probably everything I just said is what I guess is going to happen because it's what's been happening for years now.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:14.500]  I don't have anybody I don't know any sources who've told me that but it's a very logical guess.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:22.500]  Apple might know that if they made the iPhone 7 the same thickness as the iPhone 6, even though they could make it thinner,
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:30.500]  but if they made it thicker and used that extra thickness to increase the battery life and maybe get rid of the
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:36.500]  maybe if image quality isn't even better than it would be otherwise but there's no
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:40.500]  the camera lens doesn't stick out from the back, which would make me very happy.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:47.500]  They might know that in the long run that would make people happy but that in the short run if they did that
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:55.500]  and then people go into a Verizon or AT&T store and side by side with a Samsung that is thinner,
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:04.500]  even if it's at the expense of battery life, that they have a reasonable reason to believe that X number of people will then pick that Samsung
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:10.500]  because wow, look how thin this is and walk out of it even though in the long run they might have been happier with the thicker phone that gets better battery life.
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.500]  But at the point of sale, that thinness will help.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:17.500]  Thinness has curve appeal over like bullet stats.
[01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:19.500]  Right.
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.500]  And in that sense of like that's a really interesting way to put it.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:29.500]  You think about what you buy when you just walk into the store and how it makes you feel in the moment.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.500]  That could actually have a huge impact.
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:39.500]  Yeah. And it's a little I know that there aren't the nerds out there, the people who either do think more logically than most people
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:43.500]  or at least like to think that they think a lot more logically than most other people.
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:47.500]  And I suspect there's a lot of people listening to us right now who that applies to.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:52.500]  I think that makes me angry because I'm so logical that would never fool me.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:58:00.500]  A, you might be fooling yourself about just how emotional the emotional context of buying it.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:08.500]  But B, even if you do have a good point because you pre-order your phones and you buy your new iPhone before you've ever even seen it in person,
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:17.500]  you can't underestimate that when you're selling in the quantities that Apple sells at that most people are not like the people who listen to this show.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:24.500]  Yeah. But also what feels like a real change in attitude from over the years.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:31.500]  I don't know if you can call this a real change in attitude but there was a time when being somebody who said,
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:42.500]  Hey, look, just give me exactly what I want in this device and then leave me alone and stop trying to make this pretty.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:48.500]  If somebody said that in 1999, would you guess that that's a Mac user or a PC user?
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.500]  Because that really sounds like a PC user to me.
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:52.500]  Yeah, me too.
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:59.500]  Right? There was a time when one of our many indignities in the Apple community was that we did by and large
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:02.500]  certainly you could do more at a certain time on your Mac.
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:06.500]  It wasn't as reliable or stable but that's been the trade-offs over time.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:14.500]  But it is kind of funny to me that everybody comes in, it's like the six different guys, the six blind men describing an elephant.
[01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:17.500]  It's like everybody's holding a different part of the elephant when they describe it.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:24.500]  And it is kind of funny how quickly we can go down this personal rat hole of having exactly the idea of what we would want in a phone.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:31.500]  But exactly the idea of what we want in a phone, if we actually sat down with people in a room, would end up being surprisingly different from person to person.
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:37.500]  There has to be somebody there at some level making those executive decisions about what they can do and make well at scale.
[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.500]  I don't know, maybe I'm pulling that out of my ass.
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:44.500]  But I do feel like you eventually get into this Homer's car type situation with people where, you know,
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:50.500]  Oh, you know what, I'd love to have a way bigger phone or a way smaller phone or I'd love to have a way longer battery life.
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:59.500]  Or, in your case, with the camera. Most people, I'm going to guess, I don't know enough about the camera to know that thing about the lens and things like that.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:02.500]  Otherwise, they wouldn't make a lot of these arguments.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.500]  You know it on common sense level though, right?
[02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:11.500]  Like when you look at the sideline guys at the Super Bowl shooting the photos for Sports Illustrated, what do their cameras look like?
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:16.500]  They have these giant lenses because there's definitely some, you know, tremendous advantages.
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:22.500]  Well, to your point about what I'm calling the curb appeal part, for example, what you said, you wish the lens didn't stick out.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:25.500]  When I think of the camera on my phone, I think of that lens.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.500]  I don't think about what's going on inside, I think about that lens.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:32.500]  And I think about the fact that every time I put my phone down, I feel a little nervous.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:36.500]  And I feel a little bit unsettled in an OCD way about that thing sticking out.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.500]  Or, in the example of talking about the headphone jack, the audio jack.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:49.500]  I mean, like we were sort of getting to, I mean, how many people think about that in terms of a cylinder versus a circle, if you take my meaning?
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:56.500]  I think when most people think about the gating factor of, I don't know what you call it, they think of a circle, not a tube.
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:00.500]  The tube is actually a much bigger deal than the circle.
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:04.500]  Right, they think of the diameter of that port as opposed to the depth of the port.
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:12.500]  Right, so to apply that same analogy, you know, when you talk about the camera, I think of a hoop and you think of a cylinder.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.500]  Yeah, I do.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:18.500]  And so, you know, for anybody else, you go, no, no, no, look, it's a hoop.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.500]  You can make that as flat as you want.
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:23.500]  But no, no, no, actually it's a cylinder and that does have an impact.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:29.500]  And this is one case where, you know, these two things, the bigger this gets, the better the phone is.
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:31.500]  The smaller this thing is, the better the phone gets.
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.500]  And those two, I mean, what are you going to do?
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:37.500]  You're going to make it look like an iMac box? Like, what would you do?
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:41.500]  You could make it like a ramp or a wedge.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:50.500]  I would love to, I like to imagine, I would like to have been, to see a transcript even, just a transcript of like meetings within Apple,
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:58.500]  where it was explained to Johnny Ive that, okay, but the camera lens is going to protrude.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.500]  What do you mean it's going to protrude?
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:05.500]  Well, it's going to visibly be not flat.
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.500]  Well, how much are we talking about? Are we talking about a monocle here?
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:12.500]  Well, Johnny, it's just enough to drive you insane.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:17.500]  We've made a prototype. Here it is.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:22.500]  And the first time he grabs that 3D printed thing, he goes, hmm, hmm, hmm, he turns it around.
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:29.500]  He places it on the desk and it goes, waka, waka, waka, waka, because it's not flat.
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:36.500]  Can you imagine, oh my God, I bet he was just slamming Xanax after that.
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.500]  That would just have to make him so crazy.
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:42.500]  It's like selling somebody a pair of gloves with a built-in hangnail on it.
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:46.500]  Can we have it without the hangnail?
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:52.500]  The nubbin on the iPhone 6, all of, you know, 6, 6S and the Plus models is, to me,
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:56.500]  like one of the most fascinating things that's ever come out of Apple.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.500]  Because you have to know the company's history and their obsessions
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:04.500]  and the sort of things that the people who work there care about.
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.500]  It's what, a couple three millimeters, maybe?
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.500]  I don't even know how you would measure it.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500]  I mean, it's real, real small.
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:13.500]  But, on the other hand, like your finger has no problems, like...
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:15.500]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:17.500]  Running over it like a wart.
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:19.500]  Well, yeah, that's a...
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:23.500]  Or like a canker sore, like you've bitten yourself or you can't...
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.500]  I can't stop doing this.
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:27.500]  You're not doing it because you like it.
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.500]  You're doing it because you can't stop.
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:30.500]  Yeah, you just can't stop.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.500]  You're compulsive.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:36.500]  All right, let me take a break here and tell you about our good friends at Igloo.
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:40.500]  Igloo makes the internet you will actually like.
[02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:44.500]  Look, we all struggle with productivity where everybody's constantly under pressure
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:46.500]  to accomplish more and do it faster.
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:49.500]  There is no one definite way to accomplish that.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:52.500]  There's no one system where if you just follow these steps,
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.500]  then you'll be more effective.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:59.500]  So everybody in each team devises their own methods to make things work,
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:04.500]  to collaborate, to organize documents, to organize to-dos and tasks and stuff like that.
[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:11.500]  Igloo can help you do things your way, but only better.
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:14.500]  It's not like you get Igloo and then you have to follow the Igloo system
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:17.500]  of team communication and organization.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:24.500]  Igloo is a flexible, configurable intranet that can be made to work
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.500]  the way your team already does work and just makes it better.
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.500]  Collaboration shouldn't be painful.
[02:04:29.500 --> 02:04:31.500]  It's an internet you'll actually like.
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:33.500]  Everything is done through the web.
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.500]  You don't need special client software.
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:40.500]  Everything is responsibly designed so you can get it from your phone,
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:46.500]  you can get it on your tablet, you can have a real nice view on your giant 27-inch iMac.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:50.500]  Sign up now. Try it for free.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:53.500]  You can use it for free indefinitely for up to 10 people.
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:05:00.500]  So if you have a small team that you're already all set, go to igloosoftware.com slash TTS.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:05.500]  That's another one where the slug of the URL is the initials of the show, TTS, and check it out.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:09.500]  If you have a team and you have a need for team communication, go check out Igloo.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:13.500]  You know what I love about Igloo? I'm just repeating what you said,
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:18.500]  but there's so many of these things where you feel like you get into a piece of software,
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:20.500]  even some very good pieces of software.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:23.500]  You feel like you're really entering into a worldview
[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.500]  where you have to learn to think like the people who made it.
[02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:30.500]  As an example of a famous company that we both admire,
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:34.500]  you kind of need to think like that one guy and then you'll really get the software.
[02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.500]  What's neat about Igloo is there's nothing you have to do.
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.500]  You can just shut off the stuff you don't need.
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.500]  There's something very satisfying about knowing the features are there,
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:45.500]  you don't have to have them on, you can make it look the way you want,
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:51.500]  and it doesn't have to be like a world-changing philosophy that you adopt in order to make the tool work.
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:52.500]  I love that.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:59.500]  Yeah, it's sort of like an overused analogy, but sort of like a Lego approach to making toys.
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.500]  It's not like here's the toy, you have to use it exactly this way.
[02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:05.500]  You just put the pieces together the way you want it.
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:07.500]  Well put.
[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:10.500]  All right, let's start the show.
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.500]  Yeah, you ready to go? Should I start recording?
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.500]  Well, the main thing, I mean I don't know if there's anything else you want to talk about,
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.500]  but I want to talk about the Godfather.
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:22.500]  Oh man, come on, I've got to pick up my kid in like an hour and a half.
[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:26.500]  Well, just briefly.
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.500]  Okay, yes, yes.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:31.500]  So I did not see this coming. I don't know if they kept it secret
[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:36.500]  or if I'm just a dummy who doesn't know where to look for stuff like this.
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:41.500]  But it was like, I don't know, just a couple of days ago, I saw it on Kottke's site first,
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:50.500]  where Kottke was like, hey, HBO is going to have the Godfather epic on the regular HBO on TV,
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:52.500]  which to me doesn't make any sense.
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:55.500]  This whole thing makes almost no sense.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.500]  The Godfather epic, the Godfather saga, whatever you want to call it, which version,
[02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:00.500]  can we tell what it is?
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:03.500]  The story that I heard was that at one point, you know,
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:06.500]  the Godfather and the Godfather 2 had just been so huge, so critically acclaimed,
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:10.500]  and at some point somebody got the idea to make it a miniseries that you could show on TV,
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:14.500]  and with the idea being that Copeland went in and personally supervised
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:20.500]  A, putting this together for TV, meaning
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:25.500]  B, taking out the stuff that would be, you know, too violent in that case,
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:30.500]  but also C, doing it in chronological order of the scenes in the Godfather 1 and 2, right?
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:31.500]  So far so good?
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:37.500]  So that ran as a miniseries over, I think, two or three, four nights in the 70s or 80s.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:42.500]  And then, John, I have been looking for a copy of this for so long.
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:46.500]  It's hard to find a Samostat copy of this, let alone a legit one.
[02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:53.500]  Like, you can find maybe sometimes a VHS, multi-VHS, or it's one of those things that's very hard to find.
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:57.500]  And it's not the place to start, I would say.
[02:07:57.500 --> 02:08:04.500]  But if you are a Godfather fan, with the new scenes or old deleted scenes brought back in,
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.500]  it's a whole new way to watch the movie.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:11.500]  If you have HBO Go or HBO Now, I don't know why they have two different things.
[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:15.500]  HBO Go is what I have, because I still have cable TV and I have HBO.
[02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:18.500]  So if you have cable TV and HBO, you use HBO Go.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.500]  If you don't, if you're a quote-unquote cord cutter, you sign up for HBO Now,
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:27.500]  which is exactly like HBO Go, except you just pay for it.
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:28.500]  And you don't have to pay for it.
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:31.500]  There's got to be a very interesting reason why that is.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.500]  Don't you think?
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.500]  I guess, and it's like maybe like...
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:37.500]  But I think you get exactly the same stuff.
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.500]  I think you have all the exact same...
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.500]  I think it's like the way that you have to log in is different.
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.500]  I just don't know why they don't make two different apps for it.
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:44.500]  I don't know.
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:47.500]  Or maybe there's some way that...
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:51.500]  Maybe it's so that they can just say, here's how many HBO Now users we have.
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:52.500]  Oh, I see. Sure, sure, sure.
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.500]  I don't know.
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.500]  But anyway, you have either one of those.
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:58.500]  Seemingly out of nowhere, this thing that is...
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:03.500]  I've got it in, well, in places where one can find things off certain trucks.
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:05.500]  I've been looking for this thing for five years,
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:09.500]  because I remember when it would come on TV, in reruns,
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.500]  it would come on sometimes on like what, like USA?
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.500]  I guess, yeah.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.500]  USA in the 90s.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:19.500]  But they never had the one that's chronological order, or did they?
[02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:24.500]  Well, I think that's... I think it was originally called the Godfather Saga.
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:25.500]  I think so, too.
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:26.500]  You've got to go to the Wikipedia page for this,
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:29.500]  because I think there... is there also a version that has three in it?
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:31.500]  I think so, yeah.
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:32.500]  Yeah.
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:34.500]  And I don't think it had...
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:38.500]  I don't think the Godfather Saga had the cut scene to put back in.
[02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:39.500]  Oh, okay.
[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:40.500]  I don't think. I could be wrong.
[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:48.500]  I had seen when Michael goes to Chicago to find...
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.500]  Help me out. Not Thomasine. Fabrizio.
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:53.500]  I remember, I very much remember that,
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:55.500]  and I remember thinking, that's a scene I'm glad they put in.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:58.500]  There's a lot of scenes I'm not so sure I'm glad they put in,
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.500]  but I thought that was great.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.500]  The idea of them finding Fabrizio and being able to go out.
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.500]  Do we need to do a spoiler alert here?
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.500]  Uh, yeah.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.500]  Probably.
[02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.500]  No, it's a big deal. It's a big deal, Johnny.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:10.500]  Yeah, so you should...
[02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:15.500]  If you've never seen The Godfather, or if you haven't seen it in forever,
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:18.500]  and would like to rewatch it and keep it fresh,
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:22.500]  you should stop listening to the show.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.500]  It feels so silly to say.
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:26.500]  My thanks to Igloo, Mail Route, and Backblaze.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:29.500]  My thanks to Merlin Mann, and you can stop the show.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.500]  Goodnight, everybody.
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:31.500]  And I think you'll agree with me.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:36.500]  My ending advice to you is just watch the cinematic releases
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:42.500]  of The Godfather I and Godfather II as originally released in chopped up...
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:45.500]  Spoiler alert, in chopped up chronological order.
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:46.500]  Yeah.
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:51.500]  Well, it's not chopped up as in like a Charlie Kaufman movie or something.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:53.500]  No, but it's, you know...
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:55.500]  Yeah, but I mean, watch Godfather I, Godfather II.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:57.500]  Each one is better than the other.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:58.500]  They're awfully, awfully good.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.500]  Right.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:02.500]  And the best way to watch them really is the way that they were originally made,
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:05.500]  where there's flashbacks interspersed with...
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.500]  You're going to appreciate so much more.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:09.500]  It's a little bit like a machete order type situation,
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:13.500]  where there's going to be stuff, like the one I mentioned to you,
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:17.500]  is like it's neat to see young Tessio when he's young,
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:19.500]  but like it's way more fun if you go,
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.500]  oh my God, that's totally Abe Vigoda.
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:22.500]  Like that's really cool.
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:24.500]  Like you appreciate it more in a Darth Vader kind of way.
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:25.500]  Yeah.
[02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:26.500]  Hey, Jon, thanks for having me on.
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.500]  This has been great.
[02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:29.500]  And may your first child be a masculine child.
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:30.500]  All right.
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.500]  Now, for those of you who are...
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:33.500]  Digga digga digga digga digga digga.
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:34.500]  The reason...
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:37.500]  I love this, the Godfather epic.
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:39.500]  And again, I don't think it's the better way to watch it.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.500]  I would never say that, and I don't think anybody would.
[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:45.500]  But I think it's a fascinating way to watch it if you're like me and you,
[02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:48.500]  somebody who's watched it umpteenth times.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.500]  I mean...
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.500]  It's a terrible way to watch it for the first time.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.500]  Right.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.500]  But it's a great way to watch it if you're overly familiar with it,
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:12:00.500]  because it's sort of like when you're used to listening to an album as an album,
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.500]  and when you hear certain songs,
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:05.500]  like I hear certain songs from the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:09.500]  or the bands whose albums I've listened to a gazillion times,
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:12.500]  and when I hear the song, I know what song's coming next.
[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.500]  And if I don't hear that song next, it's not...
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.500]  It's disruptive.
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:17.500]  Yeah, but it's, you know, interesting.
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:21.500]  It's an interesting juxtaposition, and it takes me out of my comfort zone.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:25.500]  Watching the Godfather epic does the same thing,
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:27.500]  where I know what comes after this.
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:30.500]  I know we go back to the 1950s and we see Michael do this,
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:33.500]  and instead we stay in the 1910s.
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:38.500]  And that's disruptive to me, and it makes me see that in a new way.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.500]  Well, and it's funny, because watching it in that order,
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:43.500]  and this is much more... A couple things to note.
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.500]  I would... Are you okay?
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:46.500]  I am.
[02:12:46.500 --> 02:12:48.500]  I thought you were laughing. I'm coughing. Are you dying?
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:51.500]  You need some white bread? We can get you some white bread.
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:55.500]  Two things. First of all, in the saga, which is seven...
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:56.500]  Is it seven hours long?
[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:59.500]  Right. This is the thing. I love it.
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.500]  I took a Twitter picture of it.
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:03.500]  You start playing it, and it just comes up,
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:06.500]  and it just shows on your TV as a seven-hour movie.
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:07.500]  Seven-hour movie.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:09.500]  It's a seven-hour movie.
[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:12.500]  So, two things to note is that, first of all,
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:16.500]  the first Godfather movie, which I think was well over three hours to begin with,
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:22.500]  is The Lion's Share, because I think it's also where they added the most deleted,
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:24.500]  or, you know, removed footage.
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:29.500]  Wouldn't that be fair to say, I feel like we were at least two-thirds of the way through the seven hours
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.500]  when we got into the Godfather II part?
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:32.500]  Yeah.
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:33.500]  Isn't that right?
[02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.500]  It seemed like that to me, too.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:41.500]  And then, second of all, the one that is then much more affected by this change in approach is Godfather II.
[02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:44.500]  Oh, you know, and here, duh, wait a minute. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot,
[02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:46.500]  because I'm not accounting for the stuff from 1900.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:48.500]  Oh, right. Yeah, that's it.
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.500]  Duh. Duh. Yeah, so it starts out...
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:55.500]  The movie, the Godfather saga starts out with the...
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:59.500]  It's the funeral of Vito's father, where Paolo gets shot.
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:02.500]  Yeah, I made the same mistake you did, where I completely forgot that.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:03.500]  I'm so fucking stupid.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.500]  Right.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:10.500]  But I do feel like... I can't Pepsi-challenge this,
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:16.500]  but I do feel like the movie that ended up having much more deleted footage was the first one.
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:19.500]  And for no other reason than there was a lot more Marlon Brando than before.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:22.500]  I mean, really noticeable, a lot more Marlon Brando.
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:26.500]  IMDb says that The Godfather is 175 minutes.
[02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:30.500]  So it was, as intended, or as originally released, it was close to three hours.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:33.500]  I mean, 175 minutes is called three hours.
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:36.500]  Wow, I always thought it was over three hours.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:42.500]  Well, you know what I mean. Once you get up close to three hours, it's over three hours.
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:48.500]  The reason I remember that is I've often sat down and watched The Godfather and gone,
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:52.500]  I can't believe that three hours just went by.
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.500]  That sounds silly, but I mean, it really goes by.
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.500]  Where are you on IMDb versions?
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:05.500]  Oh, I don't know. I just went IMDb The Godfather, and it says 1972.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:08.500]  So I don't think it's any kind of special edition or anything.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:12.500]  Oh my gosh. Lots of versions.
[02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:18.500]  I found myself, and I guess with Star Wars, I'm a little bit more of a superfan,
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:23.500]  and I think any additional scenes or restored scenes I would instantly know.
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:26.500]  And I've seen The Godfather many, many times.
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:29.500]  There were a couple of the scenes that were added where I knew instantly,
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:31.500]  wow, I've never seen this before.
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.500]  And then there were a couple where I was like, wait a minute, have I seen this?
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:44.500]  Yeah, like when Al Neary goes to talk to, shoot, who's the guy who owns the casino?
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:48.500]  Clingman? Is it Clingman?
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:51.500]  Yeah, remember when he goes and he beats the guy up in front of the dancers?
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.500]  Like, I had this thought, well, first of all, the scene right before that
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:58.500]  where he's talking at length with him and starts kicking his ass in the casino,
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:00.500]  I was trying to remember, is that in The Godfather 2?
[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:04.500]  That's one of the ones that I couldn't remember. Is it new? I think it was added.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:06.500]  I think.
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:10.500]  Yeah, and the whole thing with the, God, you know, it's so funny, I was thinking,
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:12.500]  Coppola loves big stage shows.
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:16.500]  There's so many stage shows in The Godfather and then in Apocalypse Now also.
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:19.500]  You think about all the stage shows with the Playboy bunnies and stuff.
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:23.500]  He's so great, or the donkey show, the show with Superman,
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:25.500]  or all the other shows in Havana. It's really interesting.
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.500]  That seems like such a big thing. Anyway.
[02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:32.500]  That's a scene that I think had to be added because I think it would have stuck out to me
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:38.500]  because to me it emphasized the power dynamics
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:41.500]  because a casino is a very, you have to actually,
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:43.500]  this is one of those things where The Godfather kind of builds on.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.500]  Oh, man, there's no grab ass. No grab ass in a casino.
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:47.500]  Right, and there's no fighting in a casino.
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:51.500]  Like, you don't, you know, everybody knows you go in a casino
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:53.500]  and there's beefy security guys around there,
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.500]  and they just, all they want to do is make sure there's no trouble
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:59.500]  and that the money just keeps flowing on the tables.
[02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:03.500]  So, like, the way that, you know, to start banging a guy on the head in a casino.
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.500]  That's the way he's doing it. It's so undignified.
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:09.500]  If I had to have a dictionary and animate a Harry Potter picture
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.500]  of what I would call a bitch slap,
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.500]  it would be Al Neary hitting Clingman in the casino.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:17.500]  He's like, pop, pop.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.500]  Poor Clingman. They're pushing Clingman out.
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:22.500]  Right. I loved it.
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.500]  I guess I can kind of see why they cut it, you know,
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:27.500]  that these movies are so long and that they really, you know,
[02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:30.500]  wanted to just cut every little bit of fat and leave.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:33.500]  Oh, boy, there were a couple that really stuck out.
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:37.500]  I'm trying to remember.
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:40.500]  There were a lot involving backstory on Mike.
[02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.500]  I feel like involving Mike and Kay backstory stuff.
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:43.500]  Yeah.
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:45.500]  You know, again, it's seven hours long.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:47.500]  I haven't watched the whole, whole thing,
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:51.500]  but I've been skipping around to, like, significant parts.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:54.500]  Yeah. I feel like it really is a Testament.
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:56.500]  Well, first of all, it is fun to watch it in chronological order.
[02:17:56.500 --> 02:18:00.500]  Cause it's just a, it's a, I never felt more,
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:01.500]  I don't want to say I've never felt more empathy,
[02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:04.500]  but it made me really appreciate De Niro's performance.
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.500]  I say that the interleaving was pretty great,
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:09.500]  but it's fun to just see all the De Niro in a row,
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:12.500]  almost as a short story.
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:14.500]  I, you know, I'd say hyperbole.
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.500]  You can't, you can't say something like this definitively,
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:19.500]  but just to be a jackass on Twitter.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.500]  After I got done with that first hour or so,
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:25.500]  which is the De Niro was young Vito.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:26.500]  I just tweeted the,
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:29.500]  it's the greatest screen performance in the history of American cinema.
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.500]  Now, do I really mean that?
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:33.500]  I would put it up there with any performance that De Niro's ever done.
[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:35.500]  Name one that's empirically better.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:37.500]  Right. It's in that A plus.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:40.500]  Let's just say that there's an A plus category that you can't go past.
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:41.500]  This is one of them.
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.500]  Yeah. Some of the other people who disputed it,
[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.500]  there were others that were out there, but it's,
[02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:48.500]  it's as good as any performance I've ever seen because it does like,
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:51.500]  it does like 10 things at once.
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:52.500]  Like one,
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:57.500]  it is completely convincing that he is the younger version of Brando that
[02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:00.500]  you saw in this movie before.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:03.500]  It is completely convincing that this is the same guy.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:07.500]  It's a different actor, but it's, it's like, Oh my God, that's the guy.
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:10.500]  And his carriage, not even just the catchphrase,
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:14.500]  it's his carriage and just the way that he he's exactly like Vito,
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:16.500]  but how you would imagine him younger.
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:21.500]  He's very dignified and reserved and kind.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:23.500]  And you could see it before, you know,
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:27.500]  he became quite the tough guy he became and you feel that he could lose at any
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:28.500]  point.
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:30.500]  Well, and the other thing that struck out to me,
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.500]  and when you see it all condensed consecutively,
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:35.500]  instead of being interspersed, one of the things that jumped out to me,
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.500]  and you know it, I mean, it's,
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:41.500]  but it just really sticks out to you that this is a guy who likes to listen
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:43.500]  more than he likes to talk.
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:46.500]  And that might make a lot of logical sense for the character,
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:50.500]  but it's not the way that movie characters are written, right?
[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:54.500]  Because you tell an actor, you don't have a lot of lines, you know,
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:57.500]  that's not good.
[02:19:57.500 --> 02:20:01.500]  De Niro makes that work like where he's acting and he is telling you so many
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:02.500]  things about this character.
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:06.500]  And it has almost nothing to do with what he says.
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:08.500]  And you're, you're, you're really articulating something.
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:11.500]  I didn't have words for when I watched this parts of this again,
[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:14.500]  the last like three nights I've been watching this and you just really
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:17.500]  articulated something to me. You're right. In other movies, you know,
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:19.500]  like a straw man, but in other movies, yeah,
[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:22.500]  it is about the number of lines about how much you get to pull, you know,
[02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:25.500]  pull a face and have an emotion. But think about scenes like,
[02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:27.500]  think about everything with De Niro.
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:31.500]  Think about Robert Duvall throughout the movie.
[02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:35.500]  Think about everybody like in the courtroom scenes.
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.500]  So much is telegraphed,
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.500]  so much is communicated by how each person mutes
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:45.500]  their emotional response, right? A famous scene,
[02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:49.500]  like when now when they had the first sit down and Vito says to Sonny,
[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:51.500]  never tell the family what you're thinking.
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:52.500]  Like never tell people what's on your mind, right?
[02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:54.500]  Never tell anybody outside the family.
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:57.500]  Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking, right? Yes. Yes.
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:59.500]  And you see that throughout the movie. Like when,
[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:03.500]  when Tom has to go into the place where the Senator is with the, you know,
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:05.500]  into, you know what I'm talking about?
[02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:08.500]  Yeah. Yep. With the, he had a little problem with a girl.
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:11.500]  He had a little problem with the girl. And the scene is, it's so awful.
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:15.500]  It's so scary. And it's so, but it's, it's not only scary and awful,
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:16.500]  but it's just, he,
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:20.500]  Gary is so undignified in the way he's trying to kind of like gather up the
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.500]  sheets while he's wearing a towel. But you,
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:27.500]  but how does Robert Duvall in that case telegraphed so much at this?
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.500]  Oh, come on guy. As well as, Oh my God,
[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:32.500]  I can't believe this is another fucking thing I have to do for the family.
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:33.500]  Do you, it's all there.
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:37.500]  I have a question about that scene. Cause I, I'm not in time. It's so long.
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:39.500]  I'm not done with this yet. I think I'm maybe around with you.
[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:41.500]  I'm about maybe a little bit more than two thirds.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.500]  I'm about three quarters through it, but I've,
[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:47.500]  I saw that scene last night. Did, did the family set him up?
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:51.500]  Yes. Yeah. Is that ever made clear? Or I just haven't got it.
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:55.500]  It is not. Well, I'm just telling you what I think they say in particular,
[02:21:55.500 --> 02:21:56.500]  because, um,
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:59.500]  Hagen makes Tom makes a point of saying you're very,
[02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.500]  you're lucky that this is Fredo's place.
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.500]  Yeah. Cause we were able to come in and help you.
[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:07.500]  I think they probably slipped him a Mickey and killed the, killed the girl.
[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.500]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think. It's a little too convenient.
[02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:11.500]  And that's why you can't remember anything.
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:15.500]  Right. I've always thought that too, but I love that they don't make you.
[02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:19.500]  Mr. Corleone. I love him in that role. He's so good.
[02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:22.500]  He's such a scumbag. Geary.
[02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:25.500]  I like the way that as he's,
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:29.500]  he's at the first time we see him at, uh,
[02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:33.500]  young Anthony's first communion party and he's reading from these
[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:36.500]  cards. It's perfect. It's perfect.
[02:22:36.500 --> 02:22:39.500]  Now with a special performance, I'm like,
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:42.500]  he's obviously he has no idea what they're going to play. I like it.
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:45.500]  I like it when he says Vito Corleone.
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:48.500]  Vito Corleone. Vito Corleone.
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:54.500]  Yeah, he's good. And his wife, Mrs. Geary. Yeah.
[02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:58.500]  Something I said, I said, said this to Syracuse.
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:00.500]  I think I said this to you. I said this to other people.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:02.500]  The thing that strikes me throughout these movies,
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:06.500]  maybe even especially Godfather II is the minor roles.
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:09.500]  There's so many people. I like, I remember,
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:14.500]  I still remember like the cop who guides Vito out of the line at
[02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:18.500]  Ellis Island. I remember the guy with the accordion and the glasses.
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:23.500]  And when, uh, when, uh, Fredo greets Mike, so Las Vegas, like I,
[02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:24.500]  I, I just,
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:28.500]  I feel like there's so many faces in this movie that I remember so clearly
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:29.500]  that even if they weren't a speaking part,
[02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.500]  they still feel like a giant part of the movie.
[02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:36.500]  The nurse who's the only other person in the hospital when Michael
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:37.500]  just happens,
[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:41.500]  no, when Michael happens upon his father and realizes he's not guarded.
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.500]  And that nurse comes in and just says like,
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:48.500]  you can't be here and says it with that sort of authority where like,
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:52.500]  let's just say that you're, you know, you were, you know,
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:54.500]  you're not your, your relative,
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:58.500]  your beloved one is not an endangered member of the mafia.
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:00.500]  You're just there to see somebody in your family's in the hospital.
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:02.500]  And a nurse comes up to you and says to you in that,
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:06.500]  in a sort of a authoritative manner, you can't be here right now.
[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:07.500]  You're like, Oh, it's almost like you,
[02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:10.500]  like you've wandered into where the medications are locked up. Like, Hey,
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.500]  you can't be here. Like you probably don't know it,
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:14.500]  but you can't be in here. You're in the wrong area. It's, it,
[02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:18.500]  it's a vivid performance. It's like it, it, you know, she's got,
[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:20.500]  I don't know, three or four lines, but, and,
[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:25.500]  but it's a great little interaction the way that Michael conveys to her.
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:28.500]  You're not a, you're not getting at me out of here. And B,
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.500]  if you don't help me, somebody's going to come in here and shoot my father.
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:34.500]  Totally. I totally agree. Yeah.
[02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:37.500]  I started to lift a list of fives a long time ago of five incredibly minor
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:41.500]  characters from the Godfather. Cause there's, and there's just so many,
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:43.500]  and you know, and I guess the guy's name is Fred Ruse.
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:46.500]  Somebody was telling me who was a producer on the film that actually also got
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:50.500]  lent out to Lucas from a Coppola, I guess from Zoetrope.
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:52.500]  But yeah, I mean,
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:54.500]  whoever was responsible for getting those faces in there,
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  they were really clicking on all cylinders. Oh, the cinematography,
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:00.500]  everything about this movie. It's so gorgeous.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:03.500]  How much darker could these scenes get? You can barely make out the figures,
[02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:06.500]  the shadows of two people in a room and yet it completely works.
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:08.500]  Oh, it's, it's amazing.
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:11.500]  And then when there is a scene and then all of a sudden when there is a scene
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:12.500]  in the sunshine, it's amazing.
[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:15.500]  I guess we talked about this once before. So we talked about this.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:19.500]  You've watched the documentary where, um, Oh God, I feel so bad.
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:21.500]  It's not Haskell Wexler. What's the guy's name?
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:26.500]  What's the cinematographer's name? Uh, not Roger Deakins.
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:30.500]  No, it's not, but it's, I could just go look it up on the internet.
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:34.500]  I hear a thousand people screaming.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:35.500]  Gordon Willis.
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:39.500]  Gordon Willis. And he said, he, he basically,
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:41.500]  you stopped me here if I got this wrong.
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:46.500]  He lit those scenes as dark as talking to mama in the house,
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.500]  as light as the wedding outside.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.500]  The wedding is completely blown out to the edge of exposure.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:53.500]  You can barely make out figures inside. You know,
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:56.500]  there's certain scenes like where you can barely make out the figures.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.500]  He said, if you move one stop in either direction, it would ruin,
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.500]  it would ruin the movie. He was so particular. He's like, if you,
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.500]  if you move one, if you move one stop up,
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:08.500]  that is going to screw up all the wedding scenes. It's going to be unusable.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:11.500]  If you move one stop down, you literally won't be able to see anything on
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:13.500]  screen in the boathouse. Right.
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:17.500]  But it's just, it's like a microcosm of like the way in that,
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:19.500]  in the Godfather two, in the,
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:24.500]  in the movie order that you're in the Michael Corleone era,
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:29.500]  and then you go back to young veto and then you go back to Michael and then
[02:26:29.500 --> 02:26:32.500]  you go back to in the Godfather.
[02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:37.500]  You're in this dark office that is so dark and so
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:38.500]  serious and so somber.
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:43.500]  And then you're out there with this great Italian music and the dancing
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:46.500]  and the fun and the sunshine. It's the same thing.
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:49.500]  It's the exact same thing and it's just the right amount of this and then
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.500]  just the right amount of that.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:53.500]  But there's a lot of stuff where light ends up playing an important role
[02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:55.500]  where light almost becomes a character,
[02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:58.500]  certainly in terms of like the dark question,
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:02.500]  but think about the scene of the entire sequence with the going after
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:07.500]  Finucci during the parade. Holy shit. Like I just like,
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:09.500]  I have like 50 things to say about that, that entire sequence,
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:11.500]  how they pulled that off with those side, you know,
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:13.500]  tracking shots that they do and him on the roof.
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.500]  But then the scene when he gets into the building and he's waiting outside
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:21.500]  the door for Finucci and he has the towel and he undoes the light bulb and
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:23.500]  then Finucci comes up and does this like tap, tap,
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:26.500]  tap to get the light back on and he's back. Ah, it's just,
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:29.500]  it's exquisite because the light is, uh, I don't know. It's just,
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:31.500]  it's just so gorgeous. Light is a character in that scene.
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:35.500]  I can't help comparing it because it's on my mind because the new movie came
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.500]  out. Uh, and you know,
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:41.500]  obviously Lucas and Coppola were peers and good friends and they came up at
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:43.500]  the same time and they know each other. Um,
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:49.500]  but to compare and contrast their stewardship over their fantastic 70s
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:53.500]  masterpieces. Yeah.
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:57.500]  And the ways that Coppola has gone back to the Godfather and put the Godfather
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:27:58.500]  three aside. Number one,
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:28:02.500]  the Godfather three is way better than the prequels for the star Wars movies,
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:06.500]  whatever you think of the Godfather three. Um, but it's, it's,
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:10.500]  it's disappointing, but it's not a dumpster fire, right? It's not, you know,
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:11.500]  right? It's not a disaster, right? Nobody,
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:14.500]  nobody complains about the Godfather three the way they complain about the
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.500]  star Wars prequels.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:19.500]  And then what he did with the Godfather one and Godfather two are things that
[02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:22.500]  like people like me and you are just praising to no end.
[02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:23.500]  And we're not saying, Hey,
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:25.500]  don't watch them the way they were originally released.
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:28.500]  We're saying watch them like that first and then watch it this way and you'll
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:32.500]  gain more perspective. Whereas what Lucas did with the quote unquote,
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:36.500]  special editions, like, and I got, found myself this,
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:37.500]  I'm thinking about talking about this.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:39.500]  I knew that I wanted to have you on the show this weekend.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:43.500]  We talked about this and I started thinking in my head of like what the like
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:47.500]  Lucas special edition of the Godfather epic would be.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.500]  And like,
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:55.500]  yeah, this day he would like CGI the faces like Michael's Michael's wounds from
[02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:57.500]  the cop beating him up would be much more like elaborate.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:01.500]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's exactly one. Um, okay.
[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:02.500]  So one of the things that stuck out to me,
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:06.500]  everybody knows star Wars was groundbreaking special effects cause it showed you
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:08.500]  these things that were impossible. Like a giant, you know,
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:11.500]  two mile long a star ship. Yeah.
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:15.500]  Whereas the special effects in the Godfather though are amazing.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:20.500]  I find that their street shot from, for being made in like 19,
[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:25.500]  early 1970s, the street shots of like old New York,
[02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:30.500]  whether you're talking the 1950s or 1940s,
[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:33.500]  or you're talking all the way back to the 1910s,
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:36.500]  they're all a hundred percent convincing. And I, I, I, right.
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.500]  I'm guessing they did it with like matte paintings. Um,
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:43.500]  that's how they did a lot of like wide shots back then, you know,
[02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:46.500]  before the digital age, but they're all just convincing.
[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:49.500]  And I don't know how they did it. I really don't.
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.500]  They sweated so much of the details in, I feels like to me,
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:56.500]  like just dumb stuff. Like I was noticing when, um,
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:58.500]  when Michael pulls up at Hyman Roth's house,
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:01.500]  I think he's in like a Thunderbird that red and black Thunderbird.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:04.500]  There's a little parking sticker in the window that looks completely
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:07.500]  contemporaneous to the time. Like somebody sweated that.
[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:10.500]  Somebody got that and put that in there. But also, you know,
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:13.500]  think about stuff like, uh, not that to, you know, go for the obvious one,
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:18.500]  but the authenticity of like some of the shootings.
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:20.500]  Yeah. I mean, I remember reading one time,
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.500]  I think I saw a life magazine article,
[02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:26.500]  even as a kid about shooting the scene at the, um,
[02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:30.500]  at the toll bridge was sunny. Oh yeah. And like what was involved in that?
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:32.500]  I mean, think about all the moving pieces in that it's,
[02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:36.500]  it's mind boggling or like the scene, you know, again, the scene at, uh,
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:40.500]  at, uh, what's called Lewis's or whatever at the scene at the, um,
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:44.500]  the restaurant that looks like a crime scene.
[02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:46.500]  You're watching a crime scene happen, you know,
[02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:48.500]  like when they, then when they go to the mattresses,
[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:49.500]  you see all the black and white photos.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:53.500]  That's what it looked like. And it's not pretty like when the captain gets
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:55.500]  shot in the throat or whatever, like it is,
[02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:58.500]  it does not look like a Chicago bang bang kind of shooting.
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:01.500]  How about when Mo green gets shot in the eye? Oh my God.
[02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:05.500]  I can't even think about it, but they don't cut.
[02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:08.500]  They don't cut on the gunshot. It's like, there's like a beat.
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:10.500]  He's laying down, getting a massage.
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:14.500]  He gets shot in the eye with his glasses and then, and then it takes a second.
[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:16.500]  He, maybe he ought to be telling the guy to maybe help him out,
[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:20.500]  do something with that back hair. He looks up and next to, you know,
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:23.500]  there he's been shot through his eyeglasses right into his eye.
[02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:25.500]  I don't know how they did it.
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:29.500]  You do not talk to a man like Mo green like that.
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.500]  I'm Mo green. Uh, the other one, I guess.
[02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:35.500]  He's supposed to be Meyer Lansky. Is that right? Yeah.
[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:38.500]  In the Ramona clay. So, Oh, who's the guy that Warren Beatty,
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:41.500]  Bugsy, Bugsy Siegel. Yeah. I think he's sort of a bug.
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:45.500]  Yeah. With a lot of creative licenses, you know? Sure. Sure.
[02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:49.500]  You just, I think it's a Bugsy Siegel crossed with a bunch of other people.
[02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:50.500]  Like maybe a,
[02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:55.500]  a not to piss off any real people is still involved in that business in 1971
[02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:58.500]  and then be just, you know, make it a better story.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:04.500]  Oh, Lee Strasburg. Just Lee Strasburg. Just so, so many things.
[02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:05.500]  But like for me, like the moment,
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:08.500]  the moment when Mike is at his house and says, basically,
[02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:12.500]  is it okay if we knock off, you know, Frank Pantangeli.
[02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:15.500]  And he takes it without, he's looking at the football game.
[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:19.500]  He picks up a potato chip. He says, yeah, he's small potatoes.
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:23.500]  And then eats a potato chip. I love it so much.
[02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:27.500]  When they're talking about slicing up Cuba while they're literally slicing up
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:30.500]  a cake of Cuba. Here's my note. My notes are that, uh,
[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:34.500]  I have a little note here written. It says Hyman Roth equals Yoda.
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:37.500]  Oh yeah, totally. Like evil Yoda.
[02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:40.500]  He just came back to vote in the, uh, in the presidential election.
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:42.500]  Vote I will, yes.
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:45.500]  He's going to live out his life as a Jew in Israel.
[02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:48.500]  Uh, the other death scene that really, it was sort of towards the,
[02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:51.500]  it's fresh in my mind cause it was sort of towards the end of where I paused it
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:54.500]  last night was, uh, when Carlo, now this is, uh,
[02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:59.500]  when this is Connie's first husband, uh,
[02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:04.500]  and he's, he's, he's been abusing Connie.
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:08.500]  Right. Well, while she's pregnant and did it on,
[02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:11.500]  did it purposefully, did it to collude with the part, uh,
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:15.500]  with Barzini knowing that when Sonny got the call,
[02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:19.500]  Sonny was going to drive as fast as he could straight over that.
[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:23.500]  You know, they knew exactly which, that is a really dumb plan.
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:27.500]  I got to say, Carlo, I know you're not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:29.500]  How does that turn out? Well, right.
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.500]  But it's perfect because his character would probably do that.
[02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:33.500]  His character is like a small time.
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:38.500]  Yeah. There's that one little scene at a family dinner when he, uh,
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:42.500]  it's, it's foreshadowing where, uh,
[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:44.500]  Sonny's running the show because, uh,
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:48.500]  the old man is in the hospital and Sonny is talking business.
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:49.500]  And Connie says, we never talked,
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:52.500]  but you guys never talk business at the table when daddy was here.
[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:56.500]  And he's like, ah, shut up, blah, blah, blah. And then Carlos says something,
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.500]  Hey, you know, I'd like to talk to you and Michael and Sonny goes,
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:02.500]  we don't talk business at the table. Right. Exactly. Exactly.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:05.500]  But it just shows you it's funny because at first you think it's a funny way
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:08.500]  of Sonny being a hypocrite. And then later on,
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:11.500]  it plays as Carlo wanting, you know,
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:14.500]  he kind of wants some attention from this, but he wants to get in, you know?
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:15.500]  Absolutely. Well, here's the,
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:18.500]  there's the thing that's interesting and bewildering about that, the,
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:22.500]  this kind of coastal coastal world is that it seems to me that like the,
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:25.500]  the number one qualification, I mean, apart from being, you know, Sicilian,
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:29.500]  I guess is a family. So if you're in the family, regardless,
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:32.500]  if you're blood in the family blood family, right? Right.
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.500]  Like we'll find something for you to do. But after that, like, wow,
[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:38.500]  so much, so much, um,
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:43.500]  demonstrated competence and so much demonstrated loyalty.
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:46.500]  Like we're, don't worry, dude. Like we're not, we're not light on people.
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:50.500]  We can find people who want this job, but if you want to work in this place,
[02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:53.500]  you're going to have to have a surpassing level of both loyalty and competence.
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:57.500]  Neither of which Carlo has, and he's not blood. He doesn't understand that.
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:00.500]  He thinks I'm in the, I think in my read of this, he's in the family now,
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:03.500]  why doesn't he get to be higher than Fredo? Right. Even though,
[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:07.500]  but that's not how it works. Right. Well anyway, when he gets killed,
[02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:10.500]  Oh my gosh. Cause he says, cause Michael plays him like a fiddle. He's like,
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  I can't, I can't kill you. You're my, you're my, uh, you're my wife's husband.
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:17.500]  And you're my God, my God, son's father. Yeah, exactly. And you're,
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:19.500]  you were here, there's a plane. You just got to go out.
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:20.500]  You're going to get on the plane.
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:24.500]  Gets in the car and they start strangling them.
[02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:26.500]  And he kicks the windshield out.
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:28.500]  First you hear the squeaking sound,
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:31.500]  the squeaking sound of his shoes rubbing against the windshield.
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:33.500]  Ah, it's sound design.
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:38.500]  And it's, it's this way that the violence is, it really,
[02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:42.500]  it's unsettling. Even though I've seen this so many times, umpteen times,
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:45.500]  like I've said, I can't count it. I've seen it, but it got to me.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:48.500]  It's like uncomfortable. And it's because there's no cuts. It's no editing.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:52.500]  It's just a camera right on the,
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:56.500]  the hood of the car and the car is driving away.
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:36:00.500]  Right. But what a brilliant shot to get that right to where like,
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:03.500]  first of all, he kicks it and it makes, it makes a noise.
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:04.500]  He kicks it again and it gives a little,
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  he kicks it another time and it shatters in a fairly believable way.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:09.500]  You think that was an easy shot to get?
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:13.500]  Oh, I was thinking about it cause it, no, because the guy's driving the car.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:16.500]  And then there's motion with the car. Yeah, right. Exactly.
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:19.500]  I mean, and who knows how, you know, whether kicking the windshield would,
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:21.500]  I don't know how they mounted it to the hood of the car,
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:24.500]  but however they mounted the, I don't even know,
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.500]  like is there a way that they have, the camera doesn't pan or move at all.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:32.500]  So I'm guessing that maybe they had it set up so that it ran without a human operator.
[02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:34.500]  I don't know. It seemed to me like,
[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:40.500]  Walter Murch, Walter Murch was the film editor who's the sound designer for this.
[02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:44.500]  When at the end of the first movie, remember we talked about in, uh,
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:48.500]  Toy Story 3, the seatbelt, the seatbelt you ever saw. Yeah. When, uh,
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:50.500]  when Michael is in the, the,
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:56.500]  the study and they come in and they pledge their faithfulness to the Godfather
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:37:00.500]  and Al Neary walks over to the door that K or K again,
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:04.500]  doors always so important that no selling the Kubrick guy doors, mirrors,
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:08.500]  but the K is standing outside watching this and you see Alan Neary walk up
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  making eye contact with the camera and he closes that door and that door
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:17.500]  closing is the door closing as door close you've ever heard in your life.
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:20.500]  Like how did you get such a perfect sound of like, Oh,
[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:24.500]  when that door closes in case face, right? It's,
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:28.500]  it is true. It's the door closing a store close.
[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:32.500]  Oh, how much do you love Al Neary, man? What a bad ass.
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:36.500]  He's such a bad ass. He's like, remember at one point the,
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  the Don says to Michael, it looks like you found your Luca Brazzi.
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:44.500]  Even when Al Neary gets a gut, he's still a bad ass. Yeah.
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:48.500]  Um, I guess we should probably wrap soon. I got the kid at some point.
[02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:51.500]  I don't talk about this all day, buddy, because man,
[02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:54.500]  Oh, you know what to get you back to your star Wars point though. You know,
[02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:58.500]  and it's, it's, it's not fair as a comparison because I'm sure there's a
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  million differences, but you know, here's one,
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.500]  here's one bald fact of this.
[02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:07.500]  And this kind of goes to Spielberg is two to two in some ways where, you know,
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:11.500]  in the case of Spielberg and all three of them are proud of their work, right?
[02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:16.500]  You got Coppola, you got Spielberg, you got Lucas in the case of Coppola.
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:19.500]  He's so proud of his work that it means a lot to him to have the best
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:21.500]  conceivable copy of available.
[02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:25.500]  George Lucas has claimed that there's not a decent single good copy of star
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:27.500]  Wars to put together. Well, you know what, you know,
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:30.500]  who's in the same position, fucking Francis Ford Coppola.
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:32.500]  So if you watch that documentary, you sit there,
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:36.500]  your heart skips a beat when you watch what the actual footage after paramount
[02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:40.500]  had gone out, gone out, you know, basically cut out all of the, uh,
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:42.500]  all the fades, what do they call that?
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:45.500]  They had the long leaders between scenes that cut those out to put on.
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:48.500]  They take an original copies of the film and butchered them.
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:53.500]  And so he basically, I guess they put down some serious dough to do like a 4k
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:58.500]  scan and rebuild the film, right? Like that's, that's pride in what you do.
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:00.500]  Is it like, yeah, we've got all kinds of things where we've shucked and jive.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.500]  We made this into five different versions for TV.
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:03.500]  There's different versions on video,
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:07.500]  but like here is a version that we that will stand the test of time that we can
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.500]  all be proud of. Did you see that there's,
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:14.500]  there's a new, uh, sham is that a thing floating around from,
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  uh, star Wars, the harmony extended? No,
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:23.500]  a totally new one. It's, um, somebody found a 35 millimeter print
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:27.500]  and, um,
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:32.500]  have secretly been digitizing it and color correcting it frame by frame
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:37.500]  for years now. Um,
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:42.500]  I'm not, I'm not joking you. It's, uh, let me see here.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:47.500]  Is there any like test footage out there? Um, let me see if I have a link here.
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:51.500]  It's, it's called the negative one version. So if you do star Wars,
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:56.500]  negative one, negative numeral one. Oh, here we go.
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:00.500]  Team negative one. Yeah. Team star Wars, real three sampler. Yeah. It's,
[02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:03.500]  if you, I mean, not that I don't have it cause you know, I mean it's,
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:06.500]  it wouldn't, wouldn't be legit, but if you did, I see,
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:09.500]  but if it did exist, it might exist and it might be 26,
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:13.500]  a 26 gigabyte MKV. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um,
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:16.500]  but if you look just at the stuff that's out there, it's a bunch of still frames.
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:17.500]  Um,
[02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:19.500]  and they show you like what they had from the,
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:22.500]  cause they went from a 35 millimeter print. So that's not really,
[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:26.500]  that's not a great starting place. No, no. Um, they went from that,
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:29.500]  that's a product, not a source. Yeah. They went from there and that's why they
[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:33.500]  went through literally frame by frame. Um, and you know,
[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:35.500]  like sort of as they did with the godfather, right?
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:37.500]  Yeah. They'd have to go through and frame by frame,
[02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:39.500]  like rebuild this and clean it up. So just for example,
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:41.500]  like one of the things they had to do with this, uh,
[02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:44.500]  negative one printed a new hope was that it,
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:47.500]  like the initial digital scans of the space scenes didn't even,
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:50.500]  you couldn't even see the stars. They had to do work just to get the,
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:53.500]  to bring my exposure up to get the stars. Um,
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:57.500]  but they it's,
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:01.500]  I literally, I'm not even trying to be coy here. I don't have the digital copy.
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:05.500]  What's out there yet. Well, no, no. I mean like this is not,
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:07.500]  this is not difficult to find information. There's a site,
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.500]  there's a several places you can go to,
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:13.500]  but one is called original trilogy where they have discussion forums about the
[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:16.500]  different, um, versions that are out there. Right.
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:19.500]  But one of the things though that it's like, and with the, uh,
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:22.500]  what do you call the ones that are the D specialized editions that a lot of
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  people, there's, there's, there's two, there's two, I think two general genres
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:29.500]  and people will correct me on this, but I think one is, uh,
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:32.500]  fan edits where people like,
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:35.500]  sort of something like you do something like the Phantom editor, right?
[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:38.500]  Where you go in and you kind of remake your own version of how you think it
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:41.500]  should be, or all the way down to a fan fiction kind of idea,
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:43.500]  mixing several movies together as fan edits.
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:46.500]  And then what is the other version called? Like you've got like that.
[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:48.500]  The harmony is in kind of a different thing where harmonies,
[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:50.500]  the specialized versions are just,
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:55.500]  what is the highest quality source version that is what was in the original
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:58.500]  theatrical release, right? Basically putting together and,
[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:01.500]  which is harder than it sounds because you have to get the sound editing right
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:03.500]  too. But even with his versions,
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:06.500]  I think one of the things that's lost just from going with all the diddling
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:11.500]  that Lucas had done over the years is that the color correction is off and the
[02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:16.500]  film grain texture is gone from what you see and that it's,
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:20.500]  it's the Lord's work and it's the way I would recommend anybody watching those
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:24.500]  movies if they can get their hands on them. Um, but one of the things that,
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:25.500]  that like,
[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:30.500]  it's like Lucas somehow had this version to the technical limits of film of the
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:33.500]  seventies. And I, it's like his,
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:36.500]  as his sensibilities changed on the way you do color correction and,
[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:40.500]  and the color temperature of things, they change those original things to do it.
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:42.500]  Whereas to my, I mean, again,
[02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  I can't say that I remember seeing the Godfather in the theater because it came
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:47.500]  out in the theater before I was born. But it,
[02:42:47.500 --> 02:42:51.500]  the way that Coppola has overseen, you know, the, this footage,
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:58.500]  it embraces the film grain and it embraces the color temperatures and,
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:42:59.500]  and you know, color,
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:01.500]  the green, like in the, in, as I understand it,
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.500]  I haven't watched the documentary in a couple of years,
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:07.500]  but it is a very good documentary, both as a story and as a technical document.
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:10.500]  But that, but basically the grain was not seen as certainly as noise part,
[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:13.500]  part of the restoration was not screwing up the grain, right?
[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:17.500]  Whereas part of the special editions and whatever for star Wars was,
[02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:20.500]  let's get rid of this grain that we wouldn't have if we shot it today,
[02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  which, you know, and anyway, that's what this negative one, um,
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:29.500]  issue of a new hope, apparently, you know, embraces the film grain,
[02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:31.500]  and you can see it and that, you know,
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:34.500]  there's skies that are on tattooing that are completely blown out,
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:35.500]  which is the way it looked when we were kids,
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:39.500]  instead of being bright blue like they are in the prints we know today.
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:43.500]  Oh my goodness. That's so interesting. I'll keep an eye out for that.
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:44.500]  Anyway.
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:48.500]  Yeah. I don't, you know, I hate to be overly critical. It's, it's so,
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:51.500]  it's so fashionable to beat up on George Lucas or what we perceive George
[02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:55.500]  Lucas to be, but you know, it's just the part of the part that makes it
[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:56.500]  difficult and complicated.
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:00.500]  I am not the first person to say this is that when we start to wonder if
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:03.500]  what we love about star Wars was what he loved about star Wars,
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.500]  not that it has to matter, but like,
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:08.500]  I'll bet you you could sit in a room with Coppola and watch that movie.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:11.500]  And he would be excited to watch it where he would go,
[02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:15.500]  I can't believe we got that. Like, you know, like just that shot,
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:18.500]  you have no idea how hard it was to get that shot. Like, you know, whereas,
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:19.500]  you know, with Lucas, I mean,
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:23.500]  I wonder if he even enjoys any version of that film because it really just
[02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:24.500]  feels like it's an ongoing,
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:27.500]  it's an ongoing Christmas tree in his life that he's constantly
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:29.500]  redecorating, depending on how he feels right now,
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:31.500]  not based on like what the ideal version of this would be,
[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:33.500]  but I don't know. And I know that's unkind,
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:36.500]  but that's the part is where you go. Like, it's really strange.
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:39.500]  Like when he got left to his own devices,
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:43.500]  would they not unlimited, but very generous budget. It didn't get better.
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:48.500]  He didn't produce what we, what we hoped or like what, you know,
[02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:50.500]  when we thought of George Lucas in the seventies, it was like,
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:53.500]  he's the king of our imagination. Like he's got the bet.
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:55.500]  He's like up there with Jim Henson, right. In terms of like,
[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:58.500]  he gets something in a way that I just can't.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:01.500]  And he gets that on the screen and especially in those first two movies.
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:03.500]  Yeah. And it's just weird when you were like, you got to point where you're like,
[02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:05.500]  what happened? Is this a cap grass thing? Did they swap him out?
[02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:08.500]  Like who thought puppet meetings would be fun? Yeah.
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:11.500]  I think for the special editions in particular, you could,
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:16.500]  you could effectively say he had an unlimited budget that to just make the
[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:20.500]  original trilogy as good as he wants it to be for reissue in theaters now in
[02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:23.500]  preparation for the new trilogy, just to get people excited again,
[02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:26.500]  whatever it costs, I'm sure it was well within the bounds of what,
[02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:30.500]  what any studio, you know, would have, you know, put up the money for.
[02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:37.500]  And, you know, we, we got like a dinosaur stuck into Mos Eisley.
[02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:39.500]  Yeah, exactly. That's, that's, that's a very,
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:43.500]  or just like more and more advanced little rats running around. Yeah.
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:47.500]  With a job hanging off it and everything farting. Yeah.
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:51.500]  Everything farts, everything farts. That's what,
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:56.500]  that would be a great addition to the Godfather. Just add some farts.
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:45:59.500]  Boy, you can't stop noticing those oranges. Once you notice the oranges,
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:00.500]  you really see the oranges.
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:04.500]  Don't you there are so many oranges in these movies and it's never something
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:09.500]  good that happens after the guy comes in at the beginning to talk about his
[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:16.500]  daughter who got, you know, roughed up.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:20.500]  Right after, right after Vito says,
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:24.500]  you never come from a friendship before.
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:32.500]  Just to show you, I'm not a callous man. She was the best piece of ass I ever had.
[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:36.500]  Mr. Wolf, could you call me a car?
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:45.500]  Call me a car.
[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:46.500]  Oh my God.
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:49.500]  He's a pimp. He never got out of Fontantino.
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:51.500]  The same way that they, they,
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:54.500]  they made Han Solo look like he stepped on Jabba's tail. Just make,
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:59.500]  make Robert Duvall look like he lifts his right butt cheek.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:04.500]  He just shifts, where he like awkwardly shifts a little bit, like.
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:08.500]  Just to help, help get it out in one burst.
[02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:11.500]  They're going around and Godfather too and introducing everybody.
[02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:14.500]  Batiste is introducing everybody at the meeting in Havana.
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:17.500]  And from UTNT.
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:21.500]  Simon Roth.
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:24.500]  Okay. Somebody out there. I don't know who it's going to be.
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:29.500]  I'm just imagining somebody like a Joe Steele. Somebody could do this. Todd.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:30.500]  I'm sure Todd could do this.
[02:47:30.500 --> 02:47:35.500]  Could we please get at least a short supercut of the George Luke,
[02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:42.500]  George Lucas special edition of the Godfather with farts.
[02:47:42.500 --> 02:47:46.500]  And that meeting in Cuba, just some CGI out a bunch of like,
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:49.500]  really rich Cuban food to the table.
[02:47:49.500 --> 02:47:57.500]  I'd give four million bucks for it to not hurt when I take a piss.
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.500]  All right. I think that's a show.
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:01.500]  Oh, thanks for having me on, John. I think we helped a lot of people.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:04.500]  I hope the weekend goes okay. I hope you survive.
[02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:07.500]  Make sure you pick up some extra bread.
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:14.500]  I'm going to run out right now.
[02:48:14.500 --> 02:48:43.500]  God, I love you.
