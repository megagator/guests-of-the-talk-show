[00:00.000 --> 00:02.960]  Glenn. Happy holidays. Happy holidays to you.
[00:03.000 --> 00:07.500]  It was Philadelphia and ice storm extravaganza like Seattle. No, you know what?
[00:07.500 --> 00:11.320]  We, it was cold ice cold. I mean, really. I mean, and again,
[00:11.320 --> 00:15.880]  I don't even want to complain cause I know the temperature. Yeah. Uh,
[00:15.920 --> 00:18.800]  basically I don't want to complain. It got really cold,
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.160]  but we avoided all of the precipitation or, you know,
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.520]  other than like a little bit of rain,
[00:23.520 --> 00:25.720]  but I didn't even have to assault our sidewalks.
[00:25.720 --> 00:29.960]  So given how much terrible precipitation, snow, ice,
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.320]  whatever has hit everybody over the last week, I don't want to complain.
[00:34.680 --> 00:37.880]  Yeah. We got, we got coded on the Friday before Christmas.
[00:37.880 --> 00:39.320]  Seattle turned into a,
[00:39.520 --> 00:42.960]  just a solid sheet of unbroken ice across the entire city.
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.960]  Like we've been put under some kind of acrylic layer and if you didn't have to
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.280]  go out, I was talking to, I had a medical appointment yesterday and I was talking
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.160]  to all the medical staff and I was like, do you have to go out? And they're like,
[00:53.160 --> 00:56.280]  uh, I was, I was supposed to come in and I was getting the car ready.
[00:56.280 --> 00:58.880]  And then they're like, don't come in. And the doctor I had is like, well,
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.040]  I wasn't going to go in, but a patient needed me and he's from the Northeast.
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.760]  So we drove very carefully and we met at the hospital. Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:06.040 --> 01:07.440]  I saw a thing, and again,
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.200]  Philadelphia does not get by far and away the worst winter weather,
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.560]  but it's, you know, we, we definitely, you know, get icy roads.
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.080]  And I saw that with the weather nationwide that like a surging Google trend was
[01:21.080 --> 01:23.120]  how to drive on icy roads.
[01:24.680 --> 01:26.360]  Don't. Yes, exactly.
[01:27.440 --> 01:30.440]  I lived in Maine for two winters, two winters in one summer,
[01:30.440 --> 01:31.920]  which is the wrong way to do it.
[01:32.200 --> 01:36.440]  And the trick is in climates that get a lot of bad weather, typically, you know,
[01:36.440 --> 01:36.640]  you know,
[01:36.640 --> 01:39.640]  you get the snow and it gets packed down and you drive on snow and you have snow
[01:39.640 --> 01:41.360]  tires, you have to change your car if you need them.
[01:41.640 --> 01:44.120]  And it's the ice that gets you and people are like, well,
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.600]  if I can drive on snow, I can drive on ice. No, you can't drive on ice.
[01:47.600 --> 01:52.520]  Let's don't know. No, it's like tip number one. Don't tip number two.
[01:52.560 --> 01:56.680]  Seriously, don't tip number three, seriously, leave your car where it is.
[01:57.280 --> 01:58.880]  You know, if you're worried about the battery,
[01:58.920 --> 02:03.200]  start the car up and just leave it in park for five minutes to warm it up and,
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.320]  and then just turn it off and go back inside. And number four, if you really,
[02:07.320 --> 02:12.320]  really have to go somewhere that the only secret to driving on ice is to go like
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.520]  an inch a minute. Oh, there, there is,
[02:16.520 --> 02:19.240]  there is no, you don't, the traction. Oh, there's,
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.800]  we have a Subaru and I noticed the first time this year it was is a gift from my
[02:23.800 --> 02:27.400]  in-laws when they stopped driving. And I was like, what is that X button?
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.600]  X mode button? I don't know what this does. And I look it up and it's like, oh,
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.720]  it engages every kind of mode to improve traction and low gear and all at one
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.040]  separate tire function. And I'm like, oh, I didn't even know we had this.
[02:41.040 --> 02:45.320]  It's like X mode is really like ice and bad hill mode. I'm like, oh, okay,
[02:45.320 --> 02:48.840]  well next time we'll press the button, I guess, I don't know. If you want to,
[02:48.840 --> 02:52.200]  if you want to treat and no one was hurt, every time we have ice in Seattle,
[02:52.520 --> 02:56.560]  you just type in like Queen Anne ice or something like that into,
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.640]  and that's our tallest Hill in Seattle. And there's one very steep Hill.
[03:00.840 --> 03:04.000]  That's the counterbalance Hill where they used to run a cable car and they had a
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.080]  counterbalance that's still present underneath,
[03:06.080 --> 03:09.040]  even though there's no cable cars and people, you know, we're like, well,
[03:09.040 --> 03:11.440]  it's just, it's not that bad. And then you go, it's like,
[03:11.440 --> 03:16.200]  if you were curling with cars and this was happening all over Queen Anne and
[03:16.200 --> 03:20.080]  people are like, oh, nope, they're either shooting it out the window. Oh no,
[03:20.120 --> 03:21.760]  they, oh, now it's going down.
[03:21.760 --> 03:25.680]  The person in the car would just slide sideways and bumper car. And
[03:27.040 --> 03:29.960]  anyway, we got through it. Well, I hope everybody out there is all right.
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.960]  One thing that I feel certain is guaranteed given the quantity of people is that
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.240]  there's no doubt in my mind that there are numerous people who will be listening
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.240]  to this episode, hearing your and my voices who were hit by the Southwest
[03:46.480 --> 03:50.480]  airlines. I don't even know what to call it. Collapse fiasco.
[03:50.480 --> 03:55.480]  I I'm fascinated by it because I'm always interested in the way systems break
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.440]  down. Yes.
[03:59.760 --> 04:04.760]  And I'm always interested in companies that are customer focused,
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.000]  you know, and, and I am, I am a fan. I, you know,
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  I wrote about it briefly yesterday or the day before I L I like Southwest
[04:14.000 --> 04:15.280]  airlines a lot. I don't fly them.
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.280]  I used to fly them as my primary airline and in the early days of doing daring
[04:21.360 --> 04:22.600]  fireball professionally,
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.440]  it was really the difference between me being able to afford to go to all of
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.160]  these various Apple events that I went to and not,
[04:32.160 --> 04:36.240]  it was like around the mid two thousands, 2006,
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.640]  2007 that that era early days of DF,
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.920]  me doing it professionally, Southwest had super low flight.
[04:44.920 --> 04:49.920]  I mean just unbelievably lower cost flights than any other airline from Philly
[04:50.160 --> 04:55.000]  to the Bay area to Austin for South by Southwest and you had a couple of other
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.480]  places. One of the things that they had done was that they had,
[04:58.480 --> 05:00.000]  it reminds me of Apple.
[05:00.040 --> 05:05.040]  Remember when Apple locked in the flash memory prices?
[05:05.040 --> 05:07.440]  It was like in the, in the iPod era.
[05:07.480 --> 05:10.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was like everywhere.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.320]  They had prices that were ridiculous compared to everyone else cause they'd
[05:13.320 --> 05:16.160]  bought up all the capacity, right? Or, or a huge amount of capacity.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.240]  It was like a,
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.480]  maybe the move that secured Tim Cook as the future leader of the company.
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.440]  Oh yeah. Right. And then they kind of did it again with the iPad too when it was
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.760]  released. Now that was,
[05:26.760 --> 05:30.960]  I think why that price differential was so huge is they had secured a massive
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.240]  amount of expense or not expensive at parts that we can buy them on.
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.200]  The open market or we're much higher. Yeah. But like 15 ish years ago,
[05:39.200 --> 05:44.200]  Southwest did something similar with fuel prices where they had locked in like a
[05:44.320 --> 05:48.120]  longterm contract on jet fuel and,
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.040]  and the prices skyrocketed.
[05:50.080 --> 05:55.080]  But Southwest uniquely had locked in these low prices and for a couple of years
[05:55.480 --> 05:58.440]  it was just like night and day, many,
[05:58.440 --> 06:02.200]  many hundreds of dollars to fly coast to coast from Philly to the Bay area
[06:02.200 --> 06:06.760]  versus, you know, I, I remember getting like $129 coast to coast flights,
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.080]  you know, on Southwest and,
[06:09.120 --> 06:14.120]  and flying Southwest is not like flying what you think of as a budget airline.
[06:16.480 --> 06:19.320]  Right. It's, you know, it's different.
[06:19.360 --> 06:23.520]  They have the weird rule that throws everybody off. I think they still do it.
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.160]  It's been a while since I flew Southwest where you don't get a reserved seat and
[06:28.160 --> 06:33.160]  and you sort of bored, like, I don't know, like getting on a bus or actually,
[06:34.640 --> 06:38.200]  Amtrak has started doing reserved seats, which I actually really like,
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.880]  but more or less, you know,
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.920]  it's like you get like a boarding group number and first on first choice of
[06:46.040 --> 06:50.040]  seats and you just sit wherever it, there's an open seat. Yeah.
[06:50.240 --> 06:53.360]  And they figured out that by doing it that way,
[06:53.360 --> 06:57.640]  they actually fill the plane faster than if there are reserved seats.
[06:57.640 --> 07:00.520]  And that was the number one reason why they did it that way.
[07:00.600 --> 07:03.280]  And it throws everybody who's used to other airlines off,
[07:03.280 --> 07:07.760]  but once you get used to it, it's, it works out. There's often the,
[07:07.760 --> 07:10.600]  the single biggest hiccup is like, Oh, you know,
[07:10.600 --> 07:13.800]  and then the flight attendants will come on the PA system and say,
[07:13.800 --> 07:17.880]  there's like a mother and a young child. And there's only like two middle seats,
[07:17.880 --> 07:21.760]  10 rows apart that are open. What would any,
[07:21.920 --> 07:24.240]  would anybody be willing to move their seats?
[07:24.240 --> 07:27.360]  So this mother and young child can board together. Whereas, you know,
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.960]  and again, I, well, I'm a rotten person, Glenn. I never raised my hand,
[07:33.120 --> 07:37.200]  but I'll get you. Well, but you know, it's, but you're, see, this is,
[07:37.440 --> 07:39.000]  this is that I don't think Southwest,
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.720]  some other airlines are much worse about this, right?
[07:40.720 --> 07:45.040]  In which they sort of pit our personal and are like our generous and selfless
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.080]  interests against each other and Southwest from what I've,
[07:48.120 --> 07:49.400]  I've never flown Southwest.
[07:49.400 --> 07:52.960]  They don't really service the areas that I go to from Seattle or they're not the
[07:52.960 --> 07:57.280]  best deal. I can always get Alaska is often our kind of airline for lower cost
[07:57.680 --> 08:01.400]  and certain routes and Alaska has nonstop to a lot of places really affordably.
[08:01.400 --> 08:02.880]  So we're really lucky in our hub,
[08:03.160 --> 08:06.680]  but but Southwest doesn't seem to put everybody into like a prisoner's dilemma
[08:06.920 --> 08:11.840]  or, or a Hobson's choice or any of the other scenarios they, so when you get that,
[08:11.880 --> 08:14.680]  you know, Hey, could somebody move? Because we have, you know, that situation,
[08:14.880 --> 08:17.120]  that's like a minority of the time, right? It's not,
[08:17.120 --> 08:20.840]  you're not constantly feeling like you can't get your bags. Like, you know,
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.320]  I was, I just flew to my kid, did a very long European trip,
[08:24.320 --> 08:27.200]  bumming around Europe recently. And I joined him for the last two weeks.
[08:27.200 --> 08:29.720]  I was in central Europe for a couple of weeks in November, December,
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.080]  and just flying these long haul, you know, like two segments.
[08:33.080 --> 08:36.760]  So I used miles both ways and they're, you know, you got on the plane, like it,
[08:36.760 --> 08:39.680]  it feels like there's like freight car storage above you. They're like,
[08:39.680 --> 08:43.160]  we might not have room for all the bags. I'm like, what the deal you,
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.080]  what are you doing?
[08:44.080 --> 08:47.200]  It's like you could put several people up there and you're like, well,
[08:47.200 --> 08:49.680]  if you don't get on first, if you're not in the boarding on this ticket,
[08:49.680 --> 08:52.880]  class doesn't include a carry on bag that's bigger and you're not gear.
[08:52.880 --> 08:54.640]  And I'm like, Oh, just, you know,
[08:54.640 --> 08:58.000]  you're trying to make every dollar and all you're doing is making everybody,
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.600]  you know, the airlines are determined and maybe Southwest before this excluded
[09:02.800 --> 09:04.200]  to make everyone feel about them,
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.680]  like the cable companies and telephone companies. And I'm like, come on,
[09:07.680 --> 09:09.600]  you could be, you could be better,
[09:09.600 --> 09:12.840]  but they're so eager to get to scrape every dollar out. I don't know. Well,
[09:13.040 --> 09:13.560]  Southwest.
[09:13.560 --> 09:16.880]  So you've probably read all these great accounts from people who have airline
[09:16.880 --> 09:20.920]  system experience and it's like South, I thought the best description I read was
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.120]  Southwest. This is, I think the a seat, you were listening to that seat 31 B.
[09:25.120 --> 09:28.640]  It was that Southwest is a, is a, you know, it's national airline,
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.280]  but it likes to pretend it's kind of a regional point to point airline when it
[09:33.280 --> 09:36.760]  suits them because they want to argue that they don't have the same,
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.680]  they shouldn't be subject to the same rules as the mainline. Yeah. No airlines,
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.560]  like a United or something. And it's like, no, they really are.
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.040]  And this is when it breaks down because their system is designed on a knife's
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.560]  edge and the knife cut through it. Yeah. It's, it's really, I mean, and again,
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.560]  they are a customer focused airline, you know,
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.360]  and maybe by the standards of overall
[09:58.960 --> 10:01.560]  customer focused companies, period,
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.880]  even the best airline in the United States is actually not that great, but,
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.760]  but, but given the state of U S air travel Southwest,
[10:10.760 --> 10:12.480]  in my opinion is an excellent company,
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.080]  but it it's like a, I don't know,
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.560]  some kind of worst case scenario where everything that could go wrong for
[10:19.560 --> 10:22.680]  Southwest went wrong and they had
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.280]  crew at certain airports stranded,
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.560]  who couldn't get to where they needed to go and get into an airport hotel. Right.
[10:31.560 --> 10:33.680]  Cause Southwest doesn't have other arrangements with hotels.
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.880]  They couldn't get them rested in time to redeploy them. Right. And you know,
[10:37.880 --> 10:39.760]  for, for good reason, you know, there are,
[10:39.760 --> 10:43.760]  are rules about how much rest, you know, airline staff, you know,
[10:43.760 --> 10:46.760]  pilots and flight attendants need, you know, before they can work.
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.360]  And they had planes at other airports, you know, but, but no crew.
[10:51.360 --> 10:53.160]  So they had planes at certain airports,
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.160]  crew at other airports and no way to catch up,
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.760]  which is just so strange.
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.760]  It doesn't think like something that could happen, but it did.
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.760]  And to me, the most telling fact was that yesterday,
[11:07.760 --> 11:12.760]  Wednesday, 99% of all canceled flights in America were Southwest flights.
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.160]  Yep. And they're still at 50% when we record this on and they're about,
[11:18.160 --> 11:19.760]  they claim on December 30th,
[11:19.760 --> 11:23.160]  there'll be back to essentially full operation and you know,
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.160]  unless some of the post-it notes fall off the wall where they've been tracking
[11:26.160 --> 11:27.760]  flights. Right. And it's, you know,
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.360]  and it's one of those things where I always remember this phrase,
[11:31.360 --> 11:34.760]  I forget who I learned it from, but better,
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.760]  necessarily implies different, right?
[11:37.760 --> 11:41.760]  That to be better, you have to be different. And it's,
[11:41.960 --> 11:46.760]  it's such a good phrase to keep in mind because human nature is to
[11:46.760 --> 11:48.160]  eschew differences, right?
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.160]  We tend as humans to avoid things that are weird or different.
[11:56.160 --> 11:56.960]  And, you know,
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.360]  we could go on and on about how that sort of was the problem Apple faced with
[12:01.360 --> 12:04.760]  the Mac for decades, right? Was that, ah,
[12:04.760 --> 12:08.960]  the Mac is too different and it, it was different and that's what made it
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.560]  better. But people are like, ah,
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.960]  I don't want something that I'm not used to.
[12:13.360 --> 12:16.960]  And Southwest is sort of like that for an airline where it's like, ah,
[12:16.960 --> 12:19.160]  it's weird. You don't get a reserved seat.
[12:19.160 --> 12:23.960]  They don't participate in any of these cross airline things where,
[12:23.960 --> 12:28.360]  where like worst case scenario you're flying United and
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.360]  something bad happens and they don't have airplanes.
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.960]  It's like United can somehow work something out with American and maybe stick
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.360]  you on an American flight.
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.360]  If there's like an empty seat and you don't even have to pay.
[12:41.360 --> 12:44.160]  And because they have some kind of, I don't know what they call it,
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.160]  like a partnership.
[12:45.160 --> 12:48.160]  I learned the term it's called an interline agreement. I just now,
[12:48.160 --> 12:50.360]  now you learn something new when things belt down.
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.360]  There you go. Interline agreement. Southwest has no interline agreements.
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.360]  And you know, in some ways that served them well over the decades,
[13:00.360 --> 13:03.360]  because it's made them different, but then something like this happens.
[13:03.360 --> 13:07.360]  And they're like, and they're telling these poor customers and again,
[13:07.360 --> 13:10.360]  I'm sure that some of them are out there listening to us talk about it.
[13:10.360 --> 13:12.360]  And, and my, to me,
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.360]  I am not phobic in the least bit about airplane crashes because I
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.360]  truly, I, for, for whatever reason,
[13:20.360 --> 13:25.360]  the way my brain works, I've completely internalized the
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.360]  statistical truth that the safest way to get from point a to point B is in an
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.360]  airplane. Right? Yeah. So I'm not worried about that. To me,
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.360]  my phobia whenever I travel air travel is exactly what happened to people
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.360]  trying to travel on Southwest this week, which is you get to the airport,
[13:45.360 --> 13:47.360]  you get to the airport,
[13:47.360 --> 13:52.360]  you go through security and now you're on the other end of security and flight
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.360]  start getting canceled. And there's a six hour line,
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.360]  literally six, six hour line to talk to somebody at the desk.
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.360]  And what, what do you do?
[14:02.360 --> 14:05.360]  Yeah. You're stuck. You know, I'll tell you my worst airplane thing.
[14:05.360 --> 14:07.360]  And this happened to me once is,
[14:07.360 --> 14:10.360]  although not as bad as some of the incidents you heard a few years ago is when
[14:10.360 --> 14:13.360]  they put you on the plane, they take you out and then they're like,
[14:13.360 --> 14:14.360]  we're delayed. And you're on the plane,
[14:14.360 --> 14:17.360]  for hours then they're like, you know, you can't get up and use the bathroom.
[14:17.360 --> 14:19.360]  They're like, all right, we're going to let you use the bathroom. They're like,
[14:19.360 --> 14:22.360]  okay, all the bathrooms are now closed. And you're like, and, and we can't,
[14:22.360 --> 14:24.360]  Oh, and there's no gate for us to go back to. Right.
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.360]  It's like some kind of then that happened.
[14:26.360 --> 14:28.360]  There were a few planes that happened to a few years ago and that that's when
[14:28.360 --> 14:31.360]  the department of transportation pushed out a bunch of new, like it was,
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.360]  it took that impetus to put out new rules and penalties and, and things.
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.360]  I also expect what Southwest has been doing, I think along the way, like,
[14:39.360 --> 14:41.360]  you know, despite this meltdown, you and I know,
[14:41.360 --> 14:45.360]  and I think all the listeners know, unlike some organizations and companies,
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.360]  nothing they're doing here is malicious or in the interest of making more
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.360]  money. In fact, they would be delighted to not be in this situation.
[14:51.360 --> 14:54.360]  There's nothing good about this for them. And they didn't do it intentionally.
[14:54.360 --> 14:58.360]  Although they put out some nasty note to their workers a few days ago that may
[14:58.360 --> 15:01.360]  have had an impact where they're like, people are taking too much,
[15:01.360 --> 15:05.360]  too many fake days off or something. And that, you know, soured the pot,
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.360]  I think for what's coming on. But, but that said,
[15:08.360 --> 15:11.360]  every statement they've made is like, they literally put on their website,
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.360]  this is unacceptable. Or this is, you know, they,
[15:14.360 --> 15:17.360]  in their public statements, they've said, what we're doing is wrong and bad.
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.360]  And I'm like, all right, well that is kind of disarming.
[15:19.360 --> 15:22.360]  And they've told everyone who's asked, we're going to pay you back.
[15:22.360 --> 15:25.360]  And so it doesn't help when you had to spend 48 hours in an airport and miss
[15:25.360 --> 15:28.360]  Christmas, the money doesn't help, but you're not going to be monitored.
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.360]  If you had a book, an airline, like some people are like,
[15:30.360 --> 15:32.360]  I had to spend a thousand dollars to rebook on United.
[15:32.360 --> 15:35.360]  We rented a car and we spent 700,000 dollars to rebook on United.
[15:35.360 --> 15:38.360]  We rented a car and we spent $700 and we drove and we had to put an air,
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.360]  whatever. And Southwest so far has been saying,
[15:41.360 --> 15:44.360]  we're going to pay you back for all the expense you incurred.
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.360]  You're just going to have to send a lot of receipts. So it's a hassle,
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.360]  but they're not like, well, this isn't our problem,
[15:49.360 --> 15:50.360]  the historic thing and ice, blah, blah, blah.
[15:50.360 --> 15:54.360]  They're not trying to play that game. And if they do this well,
[15:54.360 --> 15:56.360]  I mean, some people are complaining already.
[15:56.360 --> 15:57.360]  They're having trouble with refunds cause the airport,
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.360]  the plane airlines still melted down. But if they do this well,
[16:00.360 --> 16:03.360]  they come out of it and they put it cause they're going to have to push out
[16:03.360 --> 16:06.360]  like all their flyers. They're gonna have to push out vouchers to everybody.
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.360]  They're going to have to pay them back.
[16:08.360 --> 16:10.360]  They're going to have to have fair sales.
[16:10.360 --> 16:13.360]  It's going to take them years to reestablish and they're all gonna have to
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.360]  promise like we're going to rebuild our system, you know,
[16:15.360 --> 16:18.360]  and rebuild relationships with all of their employees who have been all,
[16:18.360 --> 16:19.360]  you know,
[16:19.360 --> 16:22.360]  abused in different ways and all the gate agents who've been screamed at by
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.360]  people have been stuck in airports for 48 hours.
[16:25.360 --> 16:27.360]  There's no excuse for doing it cause not the gate agents problem,
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.360]  but people are going to do it cause they've lost it there. They haven't slept.
[16:31.360 --> 16:35.360]  So anyway, there's years of rebuilding, but so far I'm like,
[16:35.360 --> 16:39.360]  I can't think of another company that has been so as objectively like, yeah,
[16:39.360 --> 16:43.360]  this is our fault at Southwest when something during the meltdown part,
[16:43.360 --> 16:45.360]  not during the face saving part later. Yeah.
[16:45.360 --> 16:49.360]  Yeah. I think they're doing an okay job with the crisis management, you know,
[16:49.360 --> 16:53.360]  and, and you know, thankfully nobody has actually gotten hurt because of this.
[16:53.360 --> 16:55.360]  So, so maybe it's not the best analogy,
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.360]  but of course the gold standard is the Tylenol recall back,
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.360]  back in the eighties where there was what, what was the, as I recall the,
[17:04.360 --> 17:07.360]  the basic, it really was true. What it was like some,
[17:07.360 --> 17:12.360]  some lunatic never caught, right? Never, never. I forgot that part.
[17:12.360 --> 17:13.360]  I was looking it up recently. Yep.
[17:13.360 --> 17:18.360]  They like injected cyanide into some tablets or replace some tablets with
[17:18.360 --> 17:21.360]  cyanide, but it was like a handful at a handful of stores, right?
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.360]  Right. Very limited.
[17:22.360 --> 17:27.360]  And they, they absolutely knew the serial numbers or whatever,
[17:27.360 --> 17:28.360]  you know, whatever the numbers were.
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.360]  And it was a certain tablet from a certain factory and they, they,
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.360]  they could have just recalled just, just the laced packages.
[17:36.360 --> 17:40.360]  And instead their CEO at the time was like, Nope,
[17:40.360 --> 17:43.360]  let's every single thing with the name Tylenol in it,
[17:43.360 --> 17:48.360]  whether it's cough syrup or, or tablets or whatever, if it says Tylenol,
[17:48.360 --> 17:50.360]  everything comes off the shelves,
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.360]  everything gets destroyed and we'll start over from scratch and
[17:54.360 --> 17:56.360]  guarantee that this will never happen again.
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.360]  And that's where they rolled out the tamper proof caps to seal.
[18:00.360 --> 18:03.360]  Like that was part of that operation. I think as they retooled,
[18:03.360 --> 18:05.360]  they took months. I think there was no Tylenol.
[18:05.360 --> 18:09.360]  You can only get generic or whatever on the market. And then they, right.
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.360]  But there was, there was, there was speculation when it first happened.
[18:13.360 --> 18:15.360]  And you know, and that, you know, it really wasn't,
[18:15.360 --> 18:17.360]  it wasn't like an urban legend.
[18:17.360 --> 18:21.360]  There really were a limited small number of Tylenol packages that had
[18:21.360 --> 18:22.360]  cyanide from a lunatic.
[18:22.360 --> 18:25.360]  And there was a lot of speculation that this would be the end of the brand.
[18:25.360 --> 18:28.360]  That they would have to shut down. Nobody's ever going to buy it again.
[18:28.360 --> 18:33.360]  And instead because they reacted so strongly and so
[18:33.360 --> 18:36.360]  everything to put everybody's mind at ease by,
[18:36.360 --> 18:38.360]  by literally taking everything,
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.360]  whether they knew that it couldn't possibly have been involved with the same
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.360]  guy or not everything off the shelves, like within six months,
[18:45.360 --> 18:50.360]  their brand trust numbers were actually higher than before the incident,
[18:50.360 --> 18:53.360]  which is crazy. I don't know that that's going to happen with Southwest.
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.360]  Honestly, I, I, this is going to take to me,
[18:57.360 --> 19:01.360]  this is going to take some time because if you do the math and I did the math
[19:01.360 --> 19:04.360]  and I was like, just the back of the envelope math, I was like, wait,
[19:04.360 --> 19:08.360]  that's too many people that can't be right. But Southwest,
[19:08.360 --> 19:09.360]  part of their gimmick or,
[19:09.360 --> 19:13.360]  or their operational excellence is that they only fly one type of
[19:13.360 --> 19:15.360]  airplane, Boeing 737.
[19:15.360 --> 19:17.360]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It makes it much simpler for, right.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.360]  That's one of their things. If you don't like that plane.
[19:19.360 --> 19:23.360]  Yeah. Yeah. If you don't like a Boeing. Yeah.
[19:23.360 --> 19:26.360]  And they have slightly different seating arrangements where there's like
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.360]  always the it's they, they don't have first class or business class,
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.360]  but what they have are very generously spaced exit rows,
[19:34.360 --> 19:37.360]  which is, you know, if you fly Southwest, that's like,
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.360]  that's like the in demand seats,
[19:39.360 --> 19:44.360]  including one on every plane that doesn't have a front seat in front of it.
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.360]  So you can really stretch your legs out. There's like one seat with no,
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.360]  no seat in front of it in the exit row. Sometimes it's on the left.
[19:51.360 --> 19:56.360]  Sometimes it's on the right, but it has all of their planes are Boeing 737.
[19:56.360 --> 20:01.360]  So like the engine parts are all interchangeable and the,
[20:01.360 --> 20:03.360]  the number of seats is identical.
[20:03.360 --> 20:07.360]  So any Southwest flight can fly any, any,
[20:07.360 --> 20:11.360]  any Southwest plane can stop, can fly any Southwest flight.
[20:11.360 --> 20:16.360]  And it's part of their general operational excellence,
[20:16.360 --> 20:21.360]  where they tend to lead the industry and on-time departures and arrivals and
[20:21.360 --> 20:23.360]  stuff like that. I forget where I was going with it.
[20:23.360 --> 20:26.360]  It's the homogenization of the right, right.
[20:26.360 --> 20:31.360]  There's where I was going with it is that I,
[20:31.360 --> 20:36.360]  I think that people are going to be a little bit slower to
[20:36.360 --> 20:38.360]  forgive the people who were affected. Cause if you do the back,
[20:38.360 --> 20:40.360]  the back of the envelope math,
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.360]  which is where I was going is there's 143 seats on a Southwest flight. Oh,
[20:44.360 --> 20:45.360]  I see. Okay.
[20:45.360 --> 20:47.360]  And they tend to fly.
[20:47.360 --> 20:51.360]  They also tend to lead the industry in how full their planes are,
[20:51.360 --> 20:55.360]  which is how they're so efficient. So 2000 and they, this week,
[20:55.360 --> 20:59.360]  they've averaged more than 2000 canceled flights a day canceled.
[20:59.360 --> 21:03.360]  Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. So we're talking do the math.
[21:03.360 --> 21:06.360]  2000 times 140 is like 330,000.
[21:06.360 --> 21:11.360]  So 330,000 passengers a day with canceled flights for like,
[21:11.360 --> 21:12.360]  I really thought about the numbers.
[21:12.360 --> 21:16.360]  So a million plus people this week or a million passengers easily.
[21:16.360 --> 21:18.360]  It's easily, it's easy to, yeah.
[21:18.360 --> 21:21.360]  Easy to figure out that there's a million people and,
[21:21.360 --> 21:23.360]  and there just isn't that much surplus.
[21:23.360 --> 21:28.360]  Even if you can squeeze people onto United and American and Alaska and
[21:28.360 --> 21:30.360]  whatever other airlines, there's just no way to,
[21:30.360 --> 21:34.360]  there's no way to put a million people on onto otherwise booked planes.
[21:34.360 --> 21:38.360]  So I think it's going to be a while before Southwest recovers, but you know,
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.360]  I wouldn't bet against them because I do think that fundamentally it's a
[21:42.360 --> 21:46.360]  company that is customer focused. So we shall see.
[21:46.360 --> 21:50.360]  It's fun to fly different airlines because you get to see,
[21:50.360 --> 21:53.360]  get to see how they perform. And I flew Lufthansa. This is again,
[21:53.360 --> 21:57.360]  under my United partner. So I used to use miles and I got the, you know,
[21:57.360 --> 22:02.360]  the coach Lufthansa experience is honestly better than most, you know,
[22:02.360 --> 22:04.360]  it's, it's not quite business class,
[22:04.360 --> 22:07.360]  but it's it ain't too shabby for their long haul flights.
[22:07.360 --> 22:09.360]  So it was kind of funny. I was like, Oh yeah, that's right.
[22:09.360 --> 22:12.360]  You can run a really profitable airline that, that is,
[22:12.360 --> 22:17.360]  it's really sharp in the air too. So I dunno, it's, I think, you know,
[22:17.360 --> 22:18.360]  actually there's,
[22:18.360 --> 22:22.360]  I think there's the biggest change that I think in airlines is that the new
[22:22.360 --> 22:24.360]  seats are so thin compared to those old bulky ones.
[22:24.360 --> 22:27.360]  And I think they're generally more comfortable too,
[22:27.360 --> 22:30.360]  and they didn't give us all the room back in, you know, in knee space.
[22:30.360 --> 22:31.360]  But I think,
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.360]  I feel like the newest planes even in the worst coast sections are more
[22:36.360 --> 22:40.360]  comfortable than some of the better planes in the, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
[22:40.360 --> 22:42.360]  I don't know. Maybe it's just me. I really,
[22:42.360 --> 22:47.360]  my behind falls asleep and my back goes wonky on longer flights.
[22:47.360 --> 22:48.360]  And I managed to get through, you know,
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.360]  14 hours in one direction and 12 and the other pretty with two segments. So.
[22:52.360 --> 22:54.360]  Yeah, I know. I agree with that. I think when you,
[22:54.360 --> 22:58.360]  when you first board a plane and you, you sort of look around and,
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.360]  and you can quickly discern,
[23:00.360 --> 23:04.360]  was this plane recently renovated or is it,
[23:04.360 --> 23:08.360]  are these seats like 30 years old? A new plane definitely is more comfortable.
[23:08.360 --> 23:10.360]  No, there's something, there's something to the,
[23:10.360 --> 23:14.360]  the seat technology that they've, you know, they've, they, you know, they,
[23:14.360 --> 23:18.360]  they, they squeeze every inch out of the leg space,
[23:18.360 --> 23:21.360]  but by making the seat a little thinner,
[23:21.360 --> 23:24.360]  they kind of gain back an inch or two and an inch.
[23:24.360 --> 23:26.360]  Cause you gotta be a certain depth, right?
[23:26.360 --> 23:28.360]  You're always going to have to be back in the seat a little bit.
[23:28.360 --> 23:33.360]  So I can like cross my legs and coach and I flew my first 737 maxes on a trip
[23:33.360 --> 23:38.360]  to Ohio in October. And I was like, huh, it's like 737 max. Like, well,
[23:38.360 --> 23:40.360]  they've been flying enough of them long enough. I'm not going to worry about it.
[23:40.360 --> 23:43.360]  It was still like, all right, first time out on one of these,
[23:43.360 --> 23:46.360]  the planes are fine. It didn't have, I didn't have any, any worries,
[23:46.360 --> 23:49.360]  but it was just kind of funny to suddenly be like, oh yeah,
[23:49.360 --> 23:52.360]  that was that thing, wasn't it? Before the pandemic. Yeah.
[23:52.360 --> 23:55.360]  That was the thing everybody was talking about. Oh, geez. All right. Anyway,
[23:55.360 --> 23:59.360]  let me take a break here. Thank our first sponsors or good friends at Linode.
[23:59.360 --> 24:04.360]  Go to L I N O D E.com slash the talk show.
[24:04.360 --> 24:09.360]  Linode.com slash the talk show and see why Linode has been voted the top
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.360]  infrastructure as a service provider by both G2 and trust radius.
[24:14.360 --> 24:18.360]  They've got award-winning tech support offered 24 hours a day,
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.360]  seven days a week, 365 days a year. New year's day is coming up.
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.360]  You need tech support for your Linode account.
[24:25.360 --> 24:28.360]  Somebody's going to be there to talk to you. That is true.
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.360]  It is absolutely great tech support and it's just so easy to use
[24:33.360 --> 24:37.360]  and set up. This is where I host during fireball. I've been there for years.
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.360]  I would do it even if they didn't sponsor my podcast. I don't know where,
[24:41.360 --> 24:42.360]  I don't even know what my second choice would be.
[24:42.360 --> 24:45.360]  That is how much I love hosting my stuff at Linode,
[24:45.360 --> 24:48.360]  even though my needs are relatively very simple,
[24:48.360 --> 24:52.360]  but you can deploy your entire application stack with our one click app
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.360]  marketplace or build it all from scratch.
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.360]  Manage everything from source yourself with supported centralized tools like
[25:00.360 --> 25:04.360]  Terraform. So you want to get nerdy. You want to be at the command line.
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.360]  You want to build it all yourself. You can do it.
[25:06.360 --> 25:10.360]  You want to just click, click, click and do prebuilt stuff that they've
[25:10.360 --> 25:13.360]  guaranteed to work. You can do it that way too. You can mix and match.
[25:13.360 --> 25:17.360]  They've got it all and they offer the best price to performance value for all
[25:17.360 --> 25:21.360]  compute instances, including GPU's as well as block storage,
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.360]  Kubernetes, bare metal, all of it. They've got a new database,
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.360]  hosted service, my SQL, Mongo DB,
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.360]  PostgreSQL fully managed databases for all of the SQLs that you could
[25:35.360 --> 25:37.360]  want Mongo DB more than that.
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.360]  And it is easily deployed high to high performance database
[25:42.360 --> 25:46.360]  clusters with backup disaster recovery, data replication,
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.360]  everything you can need. It's all built in.
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.360]  That's one of their new features for 2022 go to Linode L I N O D
[25:53.360 --> 25:56.360]  E linode.com slash the talk show.
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.360]  By going to that URL with the talk show as the slug at the end of the domain,
[26:01.360 --> 26:06.360]  you can create a free account using your Google or GitHub account,
[26:06.360 --> 26:09.360]  or just use your email address. That's what I do.
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.360]  And you will get a hundred dollars in credit just for going there.
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.360]  Linode.com slash the talk show.
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.360]  A little bit of news. It's surprising to me a little bit how news,
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.360]  Apple newsy December has been usually it's pretty quiet,
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.360]  but two pieces that sort of seem related to me related to
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.360]  Apple Silicon for lack of a better catch all term.
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.360]  Mark Gurman had an excellent report in the,
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.360]  at Bloomberg on the Mac pro, which is the obvious,
[26:42.360 --> 26:43.360]  and we all know this,
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.360]  this isn't speculation or rumor when Apple announced the move to Apple
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.360]  Silicon at WWDC 2020,
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.360]  Tim Cook said that this transition will be complete by the end of
[26:55.360 --> 26:56.360]  2022.
[26:56.360 --> 27:00.360]  And it turns out it's not because of one,
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.360]  one Mac, the Mac pro,
[27:02.360 --> 27:05.360]  which is the only one that is still only on Intel.
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.360]  It's part of the backstory is this spring
[27:10.360 --> 27:15.360]  when Apple unveiled the Mac studio, which is a new form factor.
[27:15.360 --> 27:17.360]  I think one of the big stories of 2022,
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.360]  because it's a form factor that Mac pro Mac users
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.360]  have been dreaming about for, I think literally decades,
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.360]  you know, certainly since the G4 cube,
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.360]  which was the last sort of attempt at a sort of
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.360]  small form factor bigger than a mini,
[27:38.360 --> 27:42.360]  but pro spec features Mac when they unveiled it,
[27:42.360 --> 27:46.360]  John Ternus in their pre filmed event said this, you know, you know,
[27:46.360 --> 27:49.360]  we've got one more Mac to go the Mac pro.
[27:49.360 --> 27:52.360]  He even mentioned it that, you know,
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.360]  the Mac pro is still coming this, you know,
[27:55.360 --> 27:58.360]  more or less, I think to emphasize that,
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.360]  but however well specked the Mac studio is,
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.360]  and it is very well specked.
[28:04.360 --> 28:08.360]  It is not the Mac pro on Apple Silicon.
[28:08.360 --> 28:12.360]  And I think that if Ternus hadn't said that in their event,
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.360]  a reasonable conclusion for everybody outside Apple would be, Oh,
[28:17.360 --> 28:21.360]  maybe the Mac pro brand is dead. And in the Apple Silicon era,
[28:21.360 --> 28:23.360]  the Mac studio is the Mac pro.
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.360]  This is the beefiest Mac desktop you're going to be able to buy.
[28:28.360 --> 28:31.360]  So deal with it. Let's, you know, let's treat it that way.
[28:31.360 --> 28:35.360]  But they didn't, they came out and said the Mac pro is still coming.
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.360]  And the Gurman report, I don't know how best to summarize it,
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.360]  but basically is that they ran into that.
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.360]  They had planned to have an M one based something, something, you know,
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.360]  like something like a double M one ultra,
[28:52.360 --> 28:55.360]  like two ultras attached together.
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.360]  And that would be the foundation of the Mac pro and it didn't happen.
[28:59.360 --> 29:03.360]  And now who knows? Although it makes, I mean, it made sense.
[29:03.360 --> 29:06.360]  I would have been shocked. It would have, well,
[29:06.360 --> 29:08.360]  it would have been interesting cause I would have been shocked if they'd
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.360]  released an M one based Mac pro because we all knew an M, you know,
[29:12.360 --> 29:16.360]  we all knew there's another number coming and we know that another number is
[29:16.360 --> 29:18.360]  going to represent an evolution of, you know,
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.360]  what they learned in the first one. And it's well as you know,
[29:22.360 --> 29:23.360]  as you've discussed many times,
[29:23.360 --> 29:28.360]  I think you were one of the best people writing about technology who talks
[29:28.360 --> 29:31.360]  about lead time because everybody who reports in the space is always like,
[29:31.360 --> 29:33.360]  well, Apple made a sudden change. And you're like, look,
[29:33.360 --> 29:37.360]  let's back that out to eight months ago when they had to design it, test it,
[29:37.360 --> 29:40.360]  and or whatever, or sometimes 14 months or two years.
[29:40.360 --> 29:43.360]  So the M two was well underway when the M one shipped,
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.360]  like it was deeply figuring out, you know,
[29:46.360 --> 29:49.360]  from the early stages of M one production. So, you know,
[29:49.360 --> 29:50.360]  you're in that standpoint,
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.360]  you're a product manager or Tim Cook or whatever level the company,
[29:52.360 --> 29:55.360]  these kinds of decisions are being talked about to percolate up.
[29:55.360 --> 29:58.360]  And I would imagine you'd be hard pressed to say, well,
[29:58.360 --> 30:00.360]  let's just do an M one version cause we could do it. Be like,
[30:00.360 --> 30:03.360]  we said two years, we got some leeway, the M two is, you know,
[30:03.360 --> 30:05.360]  X percent more efficient on that. And this,
[30:05.360 --> 30:08.360]  we figured out this other problem let's,
[30:08.360 --> 30:10.360]  we need the double M two ultra or whatever we're going to do.
[30:10.360 --> 30:13.360]  That's going to be the pro chip and everybody be like, Oh, okay,
[30:13.360 --> 30:16.360]  we'll get, you know, the studio will ship that's on the horizon.
[30:16.360 --> 30:19.360]  That's going to fill a certain amount of demand and we're going to kind of
[30:19.360 --> 30:23.360]  prime the pump and we're going to, and unlike Apple's usual moves,
[30:23.360 --> 30:25.360]  we're going to tell people at the event. Right. And so it,
[30:25.360 --> 30:27.360]  I think it all makes logical sense,
[30:27.360 --> 30:31.360]  except that they could not apparently produce the M two. They wanted to,
[30:31.360 --> 30:32.360]  right. That seems like, I mean,
[30:32.360 --> 30:36.360]  it seems like fundamentally there was an issue with, with production,
[30:36.360 --> 30:40.360]  like actually getting it into manufacturing, into the fab.
[30:40.360 --> 30:42.360]  The M here's I'm quoting from Gurman's report.
[30:42.360 --> 30:46.360]  The M two ultra chip is destined to have some serious specifications for
[30:46.360 --> 30:49.360]  professional users, including up to 24 CPU cores,
[30:49.360 --> 30:53.360]  76 graphic cores and the ability to top out the machine with at least
[30:53.360 --> 30:56.360]  192 gigabytes of memory. All right,
[30:56.360 --> 31:00.360]  I'm going to stop there and just say that's, that's a lot of Ram,
[31:02.360 --> 31:06.360]  but, but with the current Mac pro,
[31:06.360 --> 31:11.360]  the last Intel based Mac pro it's a terabyte of memory,
[31:11.360 --> 31:13.360]  I believe. Right. Yeah. It was a huge, right.
[31:13.360 --> 31:15.360]  Cause they were very careful about that. Right. Right.
[31:15.360 --> 31:19.360]  After the lawsuit. So if you are,
[31:19.360 --> 31:23.360]  they claim and the M series is supposed to be so much more memory efficient
[31:23.360 --> 31:25.360]  though. I mean, I think that's part of the argument, right? Is that,
[31:25.360 --> 31:29.360]  well, I don't know it, but it is a weird downgrade, right? It's, it's,
[31:29.360 --> 31:30.360]  you know,
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.360]  literally like one fifth of the Ram at the maximum end.
[31:34.360 --> 31:39.360]  And I realize there are very few people who have memory needs like
[31:39.360 --> 31:43.360]  that, but if you really do need that much memory, you need the memory, right?
[31:43.360 --> 31:47.360]  There are some people in scientific computing and who are doing certain things
[31:47.360 --> 31:51.360]  who are memory constrained at a terabyte, right? Or, you know,
[31:51.360 --> 31:55.360]  at the extreme end, you're always going to find outliers like that.
[31:55.360 --> 31:58.360]  And if you're already happy to have a terabyte,
[31:58.360 --> 32:02.360]  if you wish you could have more than a terabyte maxing out at 192
[32:02.360 --> 32:04.360]  gigabytes is a serious downgrade,
[32:04.360 --> 32:09.360]  no matter how efficient Apple Silicon is overall versus the Intel
[32:09.360 --> 32:12.360]  platform. All right. Continuing from Gurman's report,
[32:12.360 --> 32:13.360]  which is the,
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.360]  the M2 ultra would be the equivalent of the high-end chip that's
[32:18.360 --> 32:23.360]  currently in the, the max studio, right? What he's calling in, again,
[32:23.360 --> 32:25.360]  he's not saying that this would be the marketing name,
[32:25.360 --> 32:30.360]  but maybe it would be the M2 extreme would be two M2 ultras
[32:30.360 --> 32:35.360]  put together in the way that the M1 ultra is two M1 maxes
[32:35.360 --> 32:40.360]  put together, right? So M1 ultra is two M1 maxes.
[32:40.360 --> 32:44.360]  Gurman is saying that their original plan was to have an M something
[32:44.360 --> 32:48.360]  extreme, which would be two M whatever ultras.
[32:48.360 --> 32:53.360]  The M2 extreme would have doubled that to 48 CPU cores,
[32:53.360 --> 32:57.360]  152 graphics cores. But here's the bad news. The company is likely,
[32:57.360 --> 33:01.360]  likely that's a very key likely scrapped that higher end
[33:01.360 --> 33:05.360]  configuration, which may disappoint Apple's most demanding users,
[33:05.360 --> 33:07.360]  blah, blah, blah.
[33:07.360 --> 33:11.360]  There's a thing hidden in here too, is all of the, excuse me,
[33:11.360 --> 33:15.360]  all the M1 chips to date have only on like a sock,
[33:15.360 --> 33:18.360]  like system on a chip memory, right? Right. So this,
[33:18.360 --> 33:21.360]  to get 192 gigabytes, even you would have to, you,
[33:21.360 --> 33:24.360]  they can put that on the same die. That's going to be external memory.
[33:24.360 --> 33:27.360]  So conceivably some higher end ones, if those shipped,
[33:27.360 --> 33:31.360]  those would have, you know, so it's, I'm right there, right?
[33:31.360 --> 33:35.360]  Is that that would all have to be some amount of external memory or not.
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.360]  Maybe with 192, maybe not, but it feels like you start to get, are they,
[33:39.360 --> 33:43.360]  they're still in the four nanometer process size. So how big would a die?
[33:43.360 --> 33:48.360]  I'm already thinking how big the die is with 24 CPU is to 76 graphic
[33:48.360 --> 33:51.360]  cores. You know, you start to get, I don't know. I mean, there are limits,
[33:51.360 --> 33:54.360]  right? There's limits in yield issues and manufacturer issues.
[33:54.360 --> 33:57.360]  And I wonder if that's not like I'm an expert in this topic.
[33:57.360 --> 34:00.360]  I've studied it in part, but I'm not a chip maker, but I know there are,
[34:00.360 --> 34:03.360]  that's where they start to get into problem areas.
[34:03.360 --> 34:05.360]  If they can't achieve the right yield that we saw a little bit of that with
[34:05.360 --> 34:06.360]  the M one and M two,
[34:06.360 --> 34:11.360]  where some of their low end chips that don't achieve the perfect testing
[34:11.360 --> 34:15.360]  get sold as the seven CPU or, or other GPU and so forth.
[34:15.360 --> 34:18.360]  So they're, they already approached that with some, you know,
[34:18.360 --> 34:20.360]  some end of what they're doing. Yeah. To me,
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.360]  it's one of the most exciting, even though I'm definitely not going to buy
[34:23.360 --> 34:28.360]  one, I have no, no reason to get a Mac pro. I don't even need the Mac studio.
[34:28.360 --> 34:30.360]  I'm very happy with my maxed out,
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.360]  no pun intended and one Mac book pro as my one and
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.360]  only main Mac. But as an observer,
[34:39.360 --> 34:44.360]  I'm super, super excited to see what the Mac pro story is.
[34:44.360 --> 34:48.360]  It's gotta be coming in 2023. And I don't know,
[34:48.360 --> 34:52.360]  maybe I, this, this is not informed speculation at all.
[34:52.360 --> 34:54.360]  No little birdies have told me this,
[34:54.360 --> 34:58.360]  but I've just had it in my head that for the given the Mac studio,
[34:58.360 --> 35:01.360]  once we saw the Mac studio and how beefed up it was,
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.360]  but the Mac studio is still based on the idea
[35:06.360 --> 35:11.360]  that whatever it is you order, it's all soldered onto the board.
[35:11.360 --> 35:14.360]  So if you know, however much Ram you want to get,
[35:14.360 --> 35:18.360]  you have to order it when you order your Mac studio.
[35:18.360 --> 35:22.360]  So my thinking is that, well, what if, is there a way,
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.360]  is that feasible that they could do a Mac pro that has a
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.360]  bigger chassis so that it's expandable and friendly to an
[35:32.360 --> 35:33.360]  enthusiast, you know, like,
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.360]  like Mac pros over the years typically have been where you can open it up.
[35:37.360 --> 35:42.360]  And this would be the one and only Mac that in addition
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.360]  to having X amount of Ram soldered onto the
[35:47.360 --> 35:52.360]  systems on a chip and to get that unified memory
[35:52.360 --> 35:57.360]  performance advantage where the same Ram is used by the graphics system as
[35:57.360 --> 35:58.360]  is used by the CPU system.
[35:58.360 --> 36:03.360]  But what if there was also another area where you
[36:03.360 --> 36:06.360]  could just put regular Ram chips in.
[36:06.360 --> 36:07.360]  So if you,
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.360]  what you really want to do is just max out the Ram and you
[36:11.360 --> 36:16.360]  don't really need massive amounts of parallel CPU or
[36:16.360 --> 36:17.360]  GPU processing,
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.360]  it's really just Ram that you just want to put all this in Ram that they could
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.360]  have the main Ram,
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.360]  which is the Ram that's on the unified memory architecture that is soldered onto
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.360]  the boards. But then there's another level of Ram that's expandable,
[36:32.360 --> 36:37.360]  and it would only be used in cases where you're doing a
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.360]  computational task that literally takes hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes of
[36:42.360 --> 36:43.360]  Ram if it's available.
[36:43.360 --> 36:49.360]  And that secondary Ram wouldn't perform quite as well as the unified memory,
[36:49.360 --> 36:54.360]  but it's better than not having the Ram at all, right?
[36:54.360 --> 36:59.360]  It's sort of like treating the unified memory that's on
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.360]  the systems on a chip as sort of like a cache, you know,
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.360]  like in CPU terms and the rest of the Ram,
[37:07.360 --> 37:11.360]  if you add it is just there. I don't know.
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.360]  I don't know if that's feasible or not,
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.360]  but it sounds to me like what is the point of still having the Mac Pro if it's
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.360]  not expandable, if, if this one product is not expandable in that way,
[37:23.360 --> 37:28.360]  even if no other Mac hardware has user expandable memory.
[37:28.360 --> 37:32.360]  Well, and yeah, and I mean, even from the storage standpoint, you know,
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.360]  Apple became allergic to slots. They like, they like jacks, not slots.
[37:36.360 --> 37:37.360]  Right.
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.360]  And which is an interesting, sorry, it sounds obscene the way I'm saying.
[37:40.360 --> 37:41.360]  Right.
[37:41.360 --> 37:44.360]  Which is weird because in a, in a Thunderbolt world,
[37:44.360 --> 37:51.360]  in a PCIE world, in a, God, I don't know where, like M2 connectors for SSD world,
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.360]  or sorry, running over NVME, trying to get all my acronyms in there.
[37:55.360 --> 38:01.360]  In that world, the difference between a port and a slot aren't the same as they
[38:01.360 --> 38:05.360]  used to be, but because it used to be slots were faster and ports were slower,
[38:05.360 --> 38:08.360]  more or less, right? Not uniformly, but it's kind of the thing.
[38:08.360 --> 38:11.360]  You want a direct memory access. You had to go to a slot inside something.
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.360]  And you did a wide, you know, multi-pin card that went in for maximum parallel
[38:16.360 --> 38:19.360]  pin access at once for these wide data paths.
[38:19.360 --> 38:22.360]  So that's kind of one area that is sort of funny.
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.360]  And the other is that, you know, Apple's obsession with the SOC,
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.360]  I understand it because they brought, you know,
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.360]  it reduces your cost to manufacture enormously, reduces the failure rate.
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  Like there's incredible, it's savings.
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.360]  And it's also as a user standpoint thing, like this issue keeps coming up.
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.360]  This is a little sidebar, but I think it's relevant to the whole,
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.360]  is I get email regularly at the Mac 911 email at Macworld about people with
[38:44.360 --> 38:48.360]  questions about like booting off external drives with external volumes with an M1
[38:48.360 --> 38:51.360]  or M2. And I have to remind people, I'm like,
[38:51.360 --> 38:56.360]  remember if your internal drive dies on an M1 or M2, your machine will not work.
[38:56.360 --> 38:58.360]  There's no way because of policy management issues.
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.360]  And it's part of the security features. This is still,
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.360]  I think relatively less known because SSDs are generally very reliable.
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.360]  Apple, you know, typically buys the most reliable ones and they,
[39:09.360 --> 39:12.360]  they do burn in and all the rest. So it's very,
[39:12.360 --> 39:15.360]  very unlikely now between the SOC and the SSD,
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.360]  the odds of getting a Mac that dies,
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.360]  like I would love to know the hard failure rate in like three months and a
[39:21.360 --> 39:24.360]  year on Macs now that aren't like a power supply issue.
[39:24.360 --> 39:26.360]  I've got to believe it's very, very low.
[39:26.360 --> 39:29.360]  And it's also Apple doesn't have to source out memory, right?
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.360]  It's got all these advantages. They're doing it in the dye and it's all great.
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.360]  But it does seem to be, you know, that they kind of contracted into that.
[39:37.360 --> 39:39.360]  And I feel like there's this great opportunity though,
[39:39.360 --> 39:42.360]  cause there's still a lot of work being done in slot based products.
[39:42.360 --> 39:44.360]  And there was a big movement at one point,
[39:44.360 --> 39:48.360]  which I think has died about the eGPU, you know, that was a port based thing.
[39:48.360 --> 39:52.360]  But there's, I don't know, maybe we're evolved past that.
[39:52.360 --> 39:54.360]  Maybe you don't need external or, you know,
[39:54.360 --> 39:57.360]  slot based graphics cards or slot based memory anymore.
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.360]  But I think your argument is good.
[39:59.360 --> 40:01.360]  I don't see how Apple would put a terabyte on a dye.
[40:01.360 --> 40:03.360]  I was misspeaking a little bit here though,
[40:03.360 --> 40:09.360]  192 gigabyte Ram on an Apple M whatever chip is not that ridiculous
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.360]  because they're putting 128 gigs on some, on the M1 Ultra,
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.360]  you can configure it to 128 gigs.
[40:15.360 --> 40:17.360]  So they can do that today.
[40:17.360 --> 40:21.360]  So 192 is not, you know, bizarre, but I think you're right.
[40:21.360 --> 40:24.360]  I mean, there is a point in which you can't get up to a terabyte
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.360]  or two terabyte for memory bound issues.
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.360]  But, and I also think it's a correct two is there's going to be memory intent
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.360]  or sorry, memory intensive applications and drive intensive applications.
[40:34.360 --> 40:38.360]  And some of those will be CPU bound and some won't be the same way.
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.360]  The CPU won't be waiting for memory or it's the delay is,
[40:42.360 --> 40:47.360]  is not as a big a deal as being able to have all the adjustable memory available.
[40:47.360 --> 40:50.360]  So it feels like there's a space for that.
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.360]  How many people do you think need a Mac Pro in the world now with the,
[40:55.360 --> 40:59.360]  in the Mac studio, you know, environment like with that out in the market,
[40:59.360 --> 41:03.360]  I felt like that really shaved the edge off a lot of potential Mac Pro buyers
[41:03.360 --> 41:06.360]  into fairly high end applications.
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.360]  But these are also going to be incredibly lucrative, you know, high,
[41:09.360 --> 41:11.360]  high dollar high margin machines.
[41:11.360 --> 41:13.360]  So Apple has a motivation to do it.
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.360]  I, you know, that's a good question.
[41:15.360 --> 41:16.360]  And I do think, you know,
[41:16.360 --> 41:19.360]  listening to various other podcasts where people talk about it and you know,
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.360]  I, I, it comes up all the time is why does Apple even bother, right?
[41:24.360 --> 41:28.360]  Maybe, maybe there won't be a Mac Pro or maybe the Mac Pro will just be
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.360]  the Mac studio in a bigger chassis.
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.360]  And you get it just for putting additional internal SSDs inside, you know,
[41:36.360 --> 41:40.360]  I wouldn't be shocked if that's what happens, but I don't think so.
[41:40.360 --> 41:44.360]  And I think the reason why isn't that it makes business sense that there
[41:44.360 --> 41:49.360]  are so many people who need something above and beyond the Mac studio,
[41:49.360 --> 41:53.360]  that it really makes great business sense in and of itself.
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.360]  But I think it's similar.
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.360]  And I, I know I've made this analogy before,
[41:58.360 --> 42:02.360]  but it's sort of like why car car makers get into
[42:02.360 --> 42:04.360]  formula one, right?
[42:04.360 --> 42:08.360]  Why do Mercedes and Porsche and Honda and companies like that fund
[42:08.360 --> 42:13.360]  formula one racing teams and build this technology because it,
[42:13.360 --> 42:18.360]  it there's a trickle down effect where pressing being at the
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.360]  forefront of what is theoretically possible
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.360]  today in raw compute power is not a bad
[42:28.360 --> 42:33.360]  advantage to have for what will
[42:33.360 --> 42:38.360]  trickle down to literally to iPhones three, four years from now. Right.
[42:38.360 --> 42:43.360]  And I think that's been true for car makers. Right. And it's not.
[42:43.360 --> 42:44.360]  And the advantage,
[42:44.360 --> 42:49.360]  the difference is with car makers getting into like making F1
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.360]  race cars, it's just for the sport of it ultimately. Right.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.360]  You're just making it.
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.360]  Whereas making the equivalent of an F1 race car
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.360]  desktop computer is actually practical for the
[43:04.360 --> 43:08.360]  handful of top tier compute users. You know,
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.360]  whether you're doing special effects for major motion pictures at
[43:13.360 --> 43:17.360]  8K resolution or scientific simulations for, you know,
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.360]  to go back to the Southwest thing, you're an airplane engineer, Boeing,
[43:21.360 --> 43:26.360]  and you're running complex aerospace engineering simulations on a new
[43:26.360 --> 43:28.360]  wing design for an airplane. And,
[43:28.360 --> 43:33.360]  and you need as much CPU as much parallelism,
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.360]  as much Ram as the fastest IO possible. You can't get enough, you know,
[43:38.360 --> 43:40.360]  you're, you're nowhere near, you're,
[43:40.360 --> 43:44.360]  you're still waiting for the computer for whatever it is that you do.
[43:44.360 --> 43:49.360]  I think that there is an advantage to Apple being in that game
[43:49.360 --> 43:54.360]  and being there that will trickle down a handful of years down
[43:54.360 --> 43:59.360]  the road to the mass market products that truly fund
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.360]  the company. I really do believe that that's true. And I think they believe it.
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.360]  And I also think Apple itself has many,
[44:07.360 --> 44:10.360]  many people who need that sort of computer.
[44:10.360 --> 44:11.360]  Yeah.
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.360]  I think you bring up a superb, like other end of the telescope thing too,
[44:15.360 --> 44:16.360]  is the M1,
[44:16.360 --> 44:21.360]  the initial M1 chip is the most powerful thing Apple made the wrong way up,
[44:21.360 --> 44:26.360]  right? Like they released the lowest end possible chip in this series,
[44:26.360 --> 44:30.360]  but it was such an outperforming chip and usually Apple is trickling down
[44:30.360 --> 44:31.360]  technology they've developed,
[44:31.360 --> 44:34.360]  they've developed for more sophisticated purposes and they have versions that
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.360]  are meant for more consumer level ones. Right? Right. So the M1 is,
[44:38.360 --> 44:41.360]  was a buildup operation and they're still building up.
[44:41.360 --> 44:45.360]  So I think that's right as you get a cycle that through and we're seeing,
[44:45.360 --> 44:49.360]  you know, the original M1s are falling off the plate. Eventually they'll move.
[44:49.360 --> 44:53.360]  I would imagine they're going to move entirely to M2s unless there's a cost
[44:53.360 --> 44:55.360]  reason to retain it. But the M1s are such good.
[44:55.360 --> 44:58.360]  The machines that are M1 based have such good performance.
[44:58.360 --> 45:01.360]  They're not like they're outdated. They're just a little slower.
[45:01.360 --> 45:03.360]  And that's the amazing thing. So maybe you have to wait.
[45:03.360 --> 45:06.360]  They come out with the M3 and then you lose the M1 generation.
[45:06.360 --> 45:08.360]  But I don't know if that's totally new for Apple,
[45:08.360 --> 45:12.360]  but I don't feel like they would build a new machine around the slowest
[45:12.360 --> 45:15.360]  possible chip in that new architecture. And in this case,
[45:15.360 --> 45:17.360]  the slowest possible chip was so fast,
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.360]  had so many savings that it made sense for them to shift over there and then
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.360]  gradually ratchet all their models up. So, but yeah, I mean if they only sell,
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.360]  I think that argument is also valid to the Formula 1 one because Apple has to
[45:30.360 --> 45:31.360]  be aspirational.
[45:31.360 --> 45:34.360]  It has to have products that people want to buy and sometimes they're going to
[45:34.360 --> 45:37.360]  go into purchasing and say, I need a $40,000 machine.
[45:37.360 --> 45:39.360]  And they're going to say, you can have a $10,000 one.
[45:39.360 --> 45:42.360]  All right, we'll get $10,000 one now and we'll put more money in the budget
[45:42.360 --> 45:43.360]  next year.
[45:43.360 --> 45:47.360]  But the fact that the $40,000 machine exists may give them more leverage to
[45:47.360 --> 45:49.360]  buy a cheaper, cheaper one.
[45:49.360 --> 45:53.360]  And we also see all the time that when you have more computational power
[45:53.360 --> 45:56.360]  available on a kind of in a desktop environment,
[45:56.360 --> 45:59.360]  you start doing more sophisticated things that couldn't be done because they
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.360]  required supercomputers.
[46:00.360 --> 46:06.360]  So part of the AI revolution has been that neural networking could be done on
[46:06.360 --> 46:10.360]  with originally with specialized graphic cards and then less and less requiring
[46:10.360 --> 46:13.360]  that as computers, just the basic computational, you know,
[46:13.360 --> 46:16.360]  central chips or the socks have improved.
[46:16.360 --> 46:20.360]  You can do incredible AI stuff and Apple devotes parts of its chip to this
[46:20.360 --> 46:24.360]  specific activity without having to have machines that are so tricked out that
[46:24.360 --> 46:26.360]  they're unaffordable. So as you get,
[46:26.360 --> 46:30.360]  if you have a Mac pro that's an M two extreme based or whatever it is,
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.360]  or an M three or whatever the next thing is,
[46:32.360 --> 46:35.360]  that's going to provoke more research that will allow, you know,
[46:35.360 --> 46:39.360]  open up new fields of research or so it'll open up new areas that researchers
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.360]  will buy these machines specifically for because they have the capability on the
[46:43.360 --> 46:46.360]  desktop to perform that kind of computation.
[46:46.360 --> 46:49.360]  Yeah. The other story along the Apple Silicon line,
[46:49.360 --> 46:55.360]  and this was published on December 23rd by Wayne ma at the information
[46:55.360 --> 46:59.360]  which is paywalled, excellent publication, very expensive though.
[46:59.360 --> 47:02.360]  It's like 400 bucks a year. And every time I think, ah,
[47:02.360 --> 47:04.360]  it's a lot of money, maybe I'll unsubscribe.
[47:04.360 --> 47:08.360]  Then they drop a story like this that is right in my wheelhouse and I'm like,
[47:08.360 --> 47:13.360]  all right, I'll keep my subscription. But this is the messy soap opera back.
[47:13.360 --> 47:17.360]  But, but, but messy soap opera that affects a multi trillion dollar company or
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.360]  a trillion dollar company is so tricky quoting from Wayne Ma's story inside
[47:21.360 --> 47:22.360]  Apple's war for chip talent.
[47:22.360 --> 47:26.360]  And a lot of this comes down to, and this is a fact, I mean,
[47:26.360 --> 47:28.360]  it's not speculation, but,
[47:28.360 --> 47:34.360]  and I don't think it's surprising given the success of the Apple Silicon
[47:34.360 --> 47:39.360]  entire division that an awful lot of talented people have left Apple either
[47:39.360 --> 47:42.360]  to start their own startups doing chip design,
[47:42.360 --> 47:47.360]  or they've been poached by Qualcomm or Intel or other companies, you know,
[47:47.360 --> 47:48.360]  but that, you know,
[47:48.360 --> 47:52.360]  it's the way it goes when one company has tremendous success in a certain area,
[47:52.360 --> 47:57.360]  the talented engineers in that division become the
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.360]  target of intense bidding from competitors, right?
[48:02.360 --> 48:04.360]  That's, that's the way the market works.
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.360]  But Apple has had some level of brain drain from their chip division. Now,
[48:09.360 --> 48:14.360]  is it so much that the division is in trouble because they've lost so much
[48:14.360 --> 48:18.360]  talent or is it that they have so much talent that they had talent to spare and
[48:18.360 --> 48:21.360]  they can still continue to lead the industry? Who knows? We'll, you know,
[48:21.360 --> 48:23.360]  we'll find out soon enough,
[48:23.360 --> 48:26.360]  but I guess stories like this are sort of, you know,
[48:26.360 --> 48:31.360]  certainly the information story to me is written with the
[48:31.360 --> 48:36.360]  overall takeaway point that maybe Apple's Silicon
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.360]  advantage is regressing to the mean. And you know,
[48:40.360 --> 48:44.360]  which is it's what happens whether it's sports, right? You know,
[48:44.360 --> 48:49.360]  the Chicago Bulls are no longer the six time champions they were when Michael
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.360]  Jordan and Scottie Pippen were playing 25 years ago. You know, it's,
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.360]  it things ebb and flow.
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.360]  And even when you have a decade long run of tremendous
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.360]  success, it tends not to last forever. Nothing, you know,
[49:04.360 --> 49:08.360]  nobody, nobody, especially in Silicon, you know, even Intel,
[49:08.360 --> 49:10.360]  the mighty Intel no longer is,
[49:10.360 --> 49:15.360]  it was once unthinkable to think that Intel would be so far behind the
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.360]  state of the art in chip performance, but here we are today and they are,
[49:19.360 --> 49:20.360]  but maybe they'll come back.
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.360]  We used to all be on MySpace also.
[49:22.360 --> 49:27.360]  And it's sad to think that the saddest thing that the same pattern happens,
[49:27.360 --> 49:29.360]  right? I mean, Intel had so many stubbles,
[49:29.360 --> 49:32.360]  they like lost the mobile chip market like four times,
[49:32.360 --> 49:36.360]  three times at least X scale and a bunch of other stuff and a bet on the wrong
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.360]  wireless technology and sold, sold their stake in what do you call it?
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.360]  The arm, right?
[49:42.360 --> 49:44.360]  Exactly. I tell you, here's the passing of a moment.
[49:44.360 --> 49:47.360]  I have had a website registered Y max,
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.360]  Y max news.com or Y max net news.com or something.
[49:52.360 --> 49:56.360]  I've actually forgotten the name for 20 years because I had my wifi networking
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.360]  news site and then I launched some ancillary blogs with less news like cellular
[50:00.360 --> 50:03.360]  and public safety and so forth. And those never got that much traction,
[50:03.360 --> 50:06.360]  but the Y max one did for a bit when, and I was like,
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.360]  I got a renewal notice and I'm like,
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.360]  why am I still paying for Y max news.com in 2022?
[50:12.360 --> 50:14.360]  I got to give it up. So I gave it up this year.
[50:14.360 --> 50:18.360]  All right, let me read this story that basically the gist of Wayne Ma's story
[50:18.360 --> 50:24.360]  is that the a 16 chip that is only available today in the eighth app,
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.360]  iPhone 14 pro models, right? Infamously this year,
[50:28.360 --> 50:36.360]  the non pro iPhone fourteens are still using the a 15 chips from last year's
[50:36.360 --> 50:37.360]  iPhones,
[50:37.360 --> 50:45.360]  although the iPhone 14 non pro have the better version of the a 15 that was in
[50:45.360 --> 50:52.360]  the eight, the iPhone 13 pro a has trickled down to the regular non pro
[50:52.360 --> 50:54.360]  iPhone 14 and that was a little baffling.
[50:54.360 --> 50:56.360]  I remember at the time everyone was trying to suss that out.
[50:56.360 --> 51:00.360]  All right, but for the a 16 here's quoting from Wayne Ma,
[51:00.360 --> 51:04.360]  Apple planned a generational leap for the graphics processor in the latest
[51:04.360 --> 51:07.360]  version of the tie in smartphones, the iPhone 14 pro,
[51:07.360 --> 51:12.360]  but engineers were too ambitious with adding new features and early prototypes
[51:12.360 --> 51:16.360]  drew more power than what the company had expected based on software
[51:16.360 --> 51:20.360]  simulations that could hurt battery life, make the device too hot.
[51:20.360 --> 51:22.360]  According to two people, blah, blah, blah.
[51:22.360 --> 51:27.360]  Obviously because Apple discovered the mistake late in development,
[51:27.360 --> 51:32.360]  it had to base the graphics processor in its iPhone 14 pro line,
[51:32.360 --> 51:36.360]  largely on the design of the chip that went into last year's iPhone model.
[51:36.360 --> 51:39.360]  According to four people familiar with the matter,
[51:39.360 --> 51:42.360]  those people described the snafu,
[51:42.360 --> 51:46.360]  which hasn't been previously reported as unprecedented in the group's history.
[51:46.360 --> 51:48.360]  The iPhone 14 pro models,
[51:48.360 --> 51:51.360]  which went on sale in September showed only small gains, blah, blah, blah.
[51:51.360 --> 51:54.360]  One of the features, let me see if I can find it here in his story.
[51:54.360 --> 51:59.360]  One of the features that was supposedly set and
[51:59.360 --> 52:04.360]  had to be cut from apparently according to his report was hardware
[52:04.360 --> 52:07.360]  based ray tracing. One of the, one of the,
[52:07.360 --> 52:11.360]  one of the features that Apple had to cut from the iPhone 14 pros graphics
[52:11.360 --> 52:13.360]  processor was ray tracing a computer,
[52:13.360 --> 52:17.360]  computer lighting a technique that brings an extra level of realism to games.
[52:17.360 --> 52:20.360]  A lack of big improvements and chips can make upgrading, blah, blah, blah.
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.360]  I have heard this from friends. I have,
[52:22.360 --> 52:27.360]  I stay informed in the games world through my
[52:27.360 --> 52:32.360]  son who is a legit gaming enthusiast and some friends who are,
[52:32.360 --> 52:35.360]  uh, have both feet in that industry. And I,
[52:35.360 --> 52:38.360]  before this story in the information came out,
[52:38.360 --> 52:44.360]  that was something that I had friends and my son had both put onto my radar,
[52:44.360 --> 52:46.360]  which is that the state of the art and graphics,
[52:46.360 --> 52:51.360]  one of the next things to look for 2023 2024 is built in ray
[52:51.360 --> 52:56.360]  tracing support. And I've seen some demos, you know, like, Oh,
[52:56.360 --> 53:00.360]  here's this certain game with hardware based ray tracing on versus off.
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.360]  And it's like, you know, the way all these modern 3d games look is so good.
[53:05.360 --> 53:09.360]  It's like, so the, the before, as it were,
[53:09.360 --> 53:11.360]  it still looks really good,
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.360]  but then you look at the after with hardware based ray tracing and it is like,
[53:15.360 --> 53:19.360]  a real step towards photo realism.
[53:19.360 --> 53:20.360]  And I mean,
[53:20.360 --> 53:24.360]  they've done non real time ray tracing has been a feature of computer animation
[53:24.360 --> 53:28.360]  for 30 years, maybe longer than that without question. But like,
[53:28.360 --> 53:30.360]  what's the speed, you know, you're running at, I don't know.
[53:30.360 --> 53:34.360]  So one time it's probably a hundred or 200 times real time. Right. So,
[53:34.360 --> 53:35.360]  Oh, even slower than that.
[53:35.360 --> 53:38.360]  Cause I remember being at Drexel in the nineties when I was studying computer
[53:38.360 --> 53:43.360]  science and there was, I remember every year the graduate students, you know,
[53:43.360 --> 53:47.360]  their thesis projects, you know, would, would be there.
[53:47.360 --> 53:49.360]  And you know, a lot of,
[53:49.360 --> 53:54.360]  a lot of stuff that you could do for a thesis in computer science is it's just
[53:54.360 --> 53:57.360]  purely mathematical. There's nothing to look at,
[53:57.360 --> 54:00.360]  but there in the mid nineties ray tracing was huge.
[54:00.360 --> 54:03.360]  And there were definitely every year there were a couple of, you know,
[54:03.360 --> 54:06.360]  graduate students whose thesis is,
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.360]  were in the ray tracing realm and therefore they had really cool demos or
[54:11.360 --> 54:14.360]  printed output, like look at this thing that, you know,
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.360]  the software they wrote wrote,
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.360]  but you could watch it run on like what at the time were these,
[54:20.360 --> 54:24.360]  we had a bunch of sun workstations in the computer science department that were
[54:24.360 --> 54:26.360]  more or less, you had to be a grad student to get access to,
[54:26.360 --> 54:31.360]  and you could watch them work. And it was like pixel by pixel by,
[54:31.360 --> 54:33.360]  you know, like it was,
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.360]  it made like the image writer dot matrix printer seemed like it,
[54:37.360 --> 54:42.360]  it output stuff fast, right? Ray tracing a single frame,
[54:42.360 --> 54:45.360]  super duper slow toy story. Of course, the,
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.360]  the first breakthrough feature film. It's like when you,
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.360]  and you look at the original toy story and how low fidelity it is compared to
[54:54.360 --> 54:57.360]  the modern Pixar films and other, you know,
[54:57.360 --> 55:00.360]  3d animated movies of that kind,
[55:00.360 --> 55:05.360]  but you talk to the Pixar or hear the Pixar people talk about how long it took
[55:05.360 --> 55:08.360]  to render a frame.
[55:08.360 --> 55:11.360]  It's, it's been a thing in computer science graphics for a while.
[55:11.360 --> 55:14.360]  It's the new frontier. It's,
[55:14.360 --> 55:17.360]  it makes total sense to me that that would have been,
[55:17.360 --> 55:22.360]  it was slated to be an iPhone 14 pro feature this year and got cut.
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.360]  Cause it's definitely not, they're very,
[55:24.360 --> 55:27.360]  very interesting to me that, you know,
[55:27.360 --> 55:29.360]  just the basic story that the,
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.360]  the a 16 graphics were supposed to be a lot better than they were in the
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.360]  actually turned out to be. Now they're not bad. I actually like, you know,
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.360]  is geek bench metal the best benchmark? I don't know,
[55:42.360 --> 55:46.360]  but it's certainly the easiest way to compare.
[55:46.360 --> 55:51.360]  It looks like the a 16 is about seven or 8% faster at graphics than the a 15
[55:54.360 --> 55:57.360]  from a year ago. So, you know, nothing to sneeze at. It's, you know,
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.360]  not a bad year over year improvement,
[55:59.360 --> 56:03.360]  but not groundbreaking. And the other thing, here's the thing,
[56:03.360 --> 56:06.360]  and you hinted at this a couple of minutes ago, need neither.
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.360]  My main frustration with both Wayne Ma story and the information and German
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.360]  story in Bloomberg about the Mac pro is that there's no dates of when these
[56:17.360 --> 56:20.360]  internal crises were determined.
[56:20.360 --> 56:23.360]  When did Apple determine that, Oh,
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  this design for the ACE,
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.360]  a 14 or a 16 chip is going to take up way too much heat and energy.
[56:32.360 --> 56:34.360]  When was this a year ago?
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.360]  By your math and thinking, I got to believe this was,
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.360]  was it like two years before the iPhone 14 pro shipped? I,
[56:43.360 --> 56:45.360]  I would have, I mean, I don't know enough about,
[56:45.360 --> 56:47.360]  I don't know enough about the cycles,
[56:47.360 --> 56:51.360]  but I would have a hard time believing that they went into production and
[56:51.360 --> 56:55.360]  the chip. I mean, yeah, it's cause they need the,
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.360]  the amount of time for each of those stages is too long.
[56:57.360 --> 57:02.360]  So maybe it was 18 months ahead of the iPhone 14 pro shipping.
[57:02.360 --> 57:03.360]  But that sounds,
[57:03.360 --> 57:08.360]  that sounds really tight in terms of like scaling up the fab to get to the
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.360]  yields you need and then integrating. I don't see, I just don't,
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.360]  I don't believe it. So it could have been two years, right? I mean,
[57:14.360 --> 57:17.360]  let's say outside is 18 months, but it could have been two years.
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.360]  Maybe more, but, but, but I think the lay person reading these stories would
[57:22.360 --> 57:25.360]  think that these were issues that came up like a year ago,
[57:25.360 --> 57:27.360]  January of 20, 22 or so.
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.360]  Right. And it's really frustrating to me and I'm not disputing their
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.360]  reporting. I believe, you know,
[57:33.360 --> 57:37.360]  both Gurman and Wayne Ma and the information in Bloomberg are certainly
[57:37.360 --> 57:40.360]  reputable. All my complaints about Bloomberg's, the big hack story,
[57:40.360 --> 57:43.360]  which is why the reason I complain about it is it's,
[57:43.360 --> 57:47.360]  it's so exceptional for never been repeated since then that they've done
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.360]  something that boneheaded, right? It, you know, if it were,
[57:51.360 --> 57:56.360]  if that sort of fiasco were par for the course for Bloomberg,
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.360]  nobody would listen to Bloomberg reports.
[57:58.360 --> 58:01.360]  It's the fact that they're overall so credible,
[58:01.360 --> 58:04.360]  but with the sources they have to me,
[58:04.360 --> 58:08.360]  they should be able to have dates and I would just love to know when these
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.360]  decisions were made,
[58:09.360 --> 58:13.360]  because to me it's one of the most fascinating things about Apple is how long
[58:13.360 --> 58:18.360]  their hardware lead times are and, and how secretive it is.
[58:18.360 --> 58:19.360]  For whatever reason,
[58:19.360 --> 58:23.360]  one of the holiest of Holy secrets that they have,
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.360]  they do not talk about these timelines of how,
[58:27.360 --> 58:30.360]  how far in advance and they, they don't want,
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.360]  they don't want to disabuse the notion that they can make last minute
[58:34.360 --> 58:35.360]  decisions.
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.360]  Even though I know they can't, everybody who's involved knows they can't.
[58:39.360 --> 58:42.360]  Right. I remember, I forget his name,
[58:42.360 --> 58:46.360]  but back when it was one of the first truly, wow,
[58:46.360 --> 58:48.360]  I'm I'm this is unbelievable.
[58:48.360 --> 58:53.360]  I can't believe that I'm one of the media people here for the
[58:53.360 --> 58:54.360]  antenna gate.
[58:54.360 --> 58:57.360]  I went to the West when you went to the anechoic room and that whole thing,
[58:57.360 --> 58:58.360]  right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[58:58.360 --> 59:01.360]  And their lead is,
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.360]  you know, it was, I don't know, a hundred people from the media were invited on the,
[59:05.360 --> 59:08.360]  you know, a day in advance to go to the press conference, you know,
[59:08.360 --> 59:11.360]  and Steve Jobs was there fresh off, you know,
[59:11.360 --> 59:16.360]  curtailed vacation in Hawaii and they played the Jonathan Mann story.
[59:16.360 --> 59:20.360]  If you don't like it, take it back or something like that. Remember that?
[59:20.360 --> 59:23.360]  Right. Yeah. It was great. It was one of his great, his viral moments.
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.360]  It's the press conference itself was by far and away the most interesting
[59:27.360 --> 59:31.360]  press event I've ever attended at Apple. But then I was part of,
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.360]  maybe there were like a dozen of us who got like this backstage tour of their
[59:36.360 --> 59:40.360]  anechoic chambers and to see some of these places where they've tested their
[59:40.360 --> 59:41.360]  antenna designs.
[59:41.360 --> 59:45.360]  And it was about a dozen of us in the media.
[59:45.360 --> 59:50.360]  The tour was led by their lead cellular antenna engineer.
[59:50.360 --> 59:52.360]  I don't remember his name off the top of my head,
[59:52.360 --> 59:57.360]  but, but he was doing the talking, but with us were Phil Schiller and
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.360]  Katie cotton as, as our escort, but nobody else from Apple.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.360]  It was the only three people from Apple, this engineer, Phil and Katie.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.360]  And at one point, you know,
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.360]  and they were encouraging questions and we'd seen these things and after one of
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.360]  the chambers, you know, there were smaller ones and bigger ones,
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]  they're super freaky.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.360]  If you've, you know, again, Ruben Caballero that's it.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360]  That's about his name.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.360]  I remember his name you'd hear,
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.360]  I mean cause those people's names are rarely uttered in public also with their
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.360]  titles. So yes.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.360]  Yep. Ruben Caballero.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.360]  That was him and he was charming and delightful.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:37.360]  And, and, but you could tell he wasn't practiced at this because,
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360]  because up until that point,
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.360]  his work had been utterly secret and they're like, okay,
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360]  I'm going to do this.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.360]  Up until that point his work had been utterly secret and they're like, okay,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.360]  Ruben, we need, we're going to invite a dozen people to the media.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360]  Can you explain what you do? And you know,
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.360]  if you've never been in one of these anechoic chambers, it is super freaky.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.360]  It, it, it, you just can't believe it. And, and some of them were very big,
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.360]  you know, where, where, you know, five or six of us could go in at the same time,
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.360]  you know, and have plenty of room,
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.360]  but you would open your mouth and talk to one another and you could hardly hear
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]  each other.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360]  It's, it's so freaky.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.360]  You're just in this room with these foam walls in this weird sort of pyramid
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360]  shape and you're,
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.360]  you're two or three feet away from anybody else and you'd talk at a normal
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  volume and the sound from your voice just disappears.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.360]  It was super freaky, very interesting, all sorts of interesting information.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.360]  But one of the people in the press asked something about like, well,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.360]  when did you start working on this external antenna design?
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.360]  Cause that was the whole thing with the iPhone four. Yes.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.360]  And Ruben Caballero, he started to answer.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.360]  And I think he said something to the effect of like two years.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  And as soon as he started this, it was something like that.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.360]  I have it in my notebook somewhere,
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.360]  but Phil Schiller jumped in immediately and was like,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.360]  we're not going to talk about timelines. And it wasn't, he, you know,
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.360]  and Phil was Phil and it was very smooth, but I noticed it.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  And he was just like, we're not going to talk about timelines. And,
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.360]  and Ruben immediately, like I could see it on his face. He was like, Oh yeah,
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.360]  I wasn't supposed to talk about timelines. And it wasn't the word, you know,
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.360]  he didn't spill state secrets all, you know,
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.360]  the gist of what he gave away was that they'd started working on the iPhone
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:32.360]  four's external antenna design around when the iPhone three came out, right?
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.360]  Three and then a year later was three GS and two years later was the iPhone
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:41.360]  four. So it was like one year after the original iPhone.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.360]  It was when they were like looking at down the road,
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.360]  where do we want to be two years ago?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:53.360]  What if we do this flat back flat front flat sides and we'll move the antenna
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.360]  outside the frame. And that way we'll solve this whole,
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.360]  because if you think back to the first three iPhones,
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.360]  the first iPhone had this gorgeous aluminum back,
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.360]  but then to fit the antennas the bottom inch or so on the back was black
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.360]  plastic. And it was sort of a weird transition, still a beautiful device,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.360]  but they had this problem where all the antennas had to be behind plastic,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.360]  not the aluminum. And then to solve that, you know, to,
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360]  to work around that, the three,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.360]  the three G and the three GS had all plastic backs,
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.360]  which were more antenna friendly, but not as nice a device.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.360]  And so, you know, two years,
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.360]  but Phil Schiller did not want people to know that re it was very,
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.360]  very clear again. Wasn't uncomfortable. It wasn't like,
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:46.360]  I'm sure Ruben did not get reprimanded afterwards or was in trouble.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.360]  Did not want that to come out.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.360]  I'm so curious about that with these Silicon issues. I am so interested.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  Yeah. It's I think, yeah, that's, I mean, that's the looking back thing.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.360]  And I think, I mean, the article, the information article is notable too,
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.360]  because it's trying to tie together. Wayne Ma is trying to tie together. And again,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360]  I think the timeline would help, but maybe he just can't,
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.360]  because it would reveal sources too. Right. You know,
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.360]  you said things at the time, but he's, he's trying to tie together, you know,
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:14.360]  the,
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.360]  the leadership of this division within Apple is being painted with the same
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.360]  kind of it's the same kind of discussion usually here reserved for female
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.360]  company leaders and politicians who are difficult to deal with.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.360]  Like Amy Klobuchar when she was getting covered,
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.360]  she made her staff wash a comb and yelled at him because he didn't bring a fork
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  on the plane is the famous one. Right. And I'm like, so this fellow,
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.360]  Johnny Srouji is the Apple exec who's documented here as the head of the,
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.360]  that's the semi division, semi-conductor division. And it's like, well,
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.360]  he's really brusque and this, and he won't hire people. And I'm like, yeah,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  it's, I mean, I would hate to be,
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.360]  I'm just trying to imagine how you hire people in one of the most rarefied
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.360]  industries for the best company making Silicon in the world.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.360]  So how much of this is,
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.360]  this is a really difficult space and the guy's a little prickly and he's
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]  hiring, you know,
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.360]  it's just a very difficult place to hire into and to keep people because
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360]  they're extremely valuable.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.360]  There's a lot of money flowing around and they're talking about on this
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.360]  exodus of Apple employees and it's like, well, maybe he's not the best boss.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.360]  I don't know. And maybe it could be that might be one factor.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.360]  Maybe people aren't given enough opportunities for advancement or whatever,
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360]  but it's also,
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.360]  you got to think about the salaries that are being offered to people to jump
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.360]  ship to these startups because there's so many, I mean,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.360]  there's so many billions and billions of dollars, trillions,
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.360]  ultimately involved in these spaces. So, and you know,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.360]  in acquisitions too is the next company,
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.360]  some of these spinoffs that where everyone's mad that they Apple people went
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.360]  off to join these or start these other companies or join them,
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.360]  they could be the next Apple acquisition for, you know,
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.360]  half a billion dollars or a billion dollars or more.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.360]  And we don't know that either. So it's kind of a, again,
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.360]  I think the reporting seems solid, but I'm kind of like, well,
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360]  maybe is it, you know,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.360]  one former junior Apple employee was told he needed to get Srouji's permission
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.360]  before he could participate in a hackathon.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360]  So he abandoned the request given the effort approval would take.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.360]  And I'm like, well, okay, but that doesn't seem that unreasonable.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.360]  You're working in one of the most secretive aspects.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360]  So maybe you'd reveal a technique,
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.360]  honestly that you learned that they don't want to know. So I don't know.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360]  There's a little bit of that in there where I'm like, this is,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.360]  this is kind of inside baseball management stuff and,
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.360]  and, and whatever. But if it's harming that division, it's an issue.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.360]  I suppose shareholders might be interested or, or what have you.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.360]  And they need to figure out how to retain and encourage talent.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360]  I think the other part of the article though,
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.360]  that I think I'm more so than the drama part is the,
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.360]  I mentioned some odd inches in passing is this thing about, you know,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.360]  it's kind of like the end of time coming, right?
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.360]  Moore's law has been remarkably accurate and it's the fact that it was so
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.360]  vaguely formulated. It's not a perfect line, but it's pretty good.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]  And we're hitting the end, you know,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.360]  they're going down to three nanometer processes and then two nanometers.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.360]  And there's this new nano sheet technology to keep current from leaking
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360]  across transistors and so forth. But it's sort of,
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.360]  there's just a lot of noise and that's, you know, 20, 25,
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.360]  I guess is when we're going to see maybe two nanometer process chips.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360]  So we're getting to the smaller and smaller size with more and more limits
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360]  that are just, you know,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.360]  you started getting down to quantum effects and all of this stuff.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.360]  There's a point at which they won't be able to make smaller chips with the
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.360]  current like approach that has essentially been unbroken with modifications
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.360]  and compensations for the history of the Silicon industry.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.360]  So what happens then? And that's not that many years away.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.360]  So there is an issue. You were talking about reversion of the mean,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.360]  but then there's also like, what is the next thing? It's all in the lab.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  I'm sure in research universities and,
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.360]  and R and D deep within sealed vaults inside Intel and arm and others.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.360]  But what happens after 2025? What's the next big breakthrough?
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.360]  And I don't, I don't know what that is.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.360]  I'm not sure there is one that's going to have the same kind of gains that
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.360]  have been happening consistently for this many years.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.360]  Yeah, I, it's interesting to see where that goes. The one,
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.360]  the one area where I do see it coming,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:09.360]  I don't have any guesses as to how high end compute for what we consider
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:13.360]  personal computers continues going forward and personal computers,
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.360]  meaning Macs, iPads, iPhones,
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.360]  things that have a user interface and run apps. And you,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.360]  you can kind of think of I'm using this as a computer, right?
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360]  When you use your iPhone,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.360]  but maybe most people don't think of it as a computer, but you and I know,
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.360]  and the people who listen to the show know it's a computer.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:36.360]  How does that keep going forward in the face of these physical limitations
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.360]  at the atomic literally getting close to the atomic level of, of, you know,
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.360]  how, how, how the processes can continue improving? I don't know.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360]  I don't know enough about it,
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:54.360]  but the one area where I can see that is continuing to advance at a
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.360]  remark at the same remarkable clip that computers have kept getting better
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.360]  and more exciting my entire life, right?
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.360]  Ever since I first realized that a computer was a thing and became
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.360]  infatuated by the idea in the seventies,
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:17.360]  as a little kid with video games is the miniaturization and the
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360]  computerization of everything.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:25.360]  AirPods would be my primary example where you literally could not make
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.360]  AirPods 10 years ago. There's the,
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  the Silicon did not exist because they run as they're too little computers.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.360]  There's a computer in your left ear and a computer in your right ear.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:43.360]  And the Silicon didn't exist 10 years ago. It really wasn't possible.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.360]  I mean, maybe in theory, 10 years ago, but certainly 15 years ago,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.360]  there was no way to make anything like an AirPod because the chips didn't
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.360]  exist. And that's the direction. And again,
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.360]  I'm such a fan of my AirPod pros. I just knew it's one of the rare devices
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.360]  that I continue not to take for granted. And I just keep thinking, my God,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.360]  these things are astonishingly amazing.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.360]  And I can hardly even feel them in my ear. They're so lightweight,
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.360]  but obviously all this stuff,
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.360]  everybody's thinking about AR glasses and, you know, beyond VR goggles,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.360]  but to get to the point where you could just wear regular eyeglasses that look
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  like normal eyeglasses and you keep them on all day and they're not heavy,
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360]  they're just as comfortable as regular glasses,
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  but they actually are computers and you know,
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.360]  projecting some kind of heads up display in front of you at all times and
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]  listening to you.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:45.360]  Obviously having AirPod style super lightweight chips with very long battery
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.360]  life is part of that. And who knows how many untold,
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:55.360]  I was going to say dozens, but hundreds of other type areas,
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  tiny little chips like that can come from.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.360]  And Apple is obviously very interested in that sort of direction for the
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.360]  future for hardware, you know, and their Silicon team is key, right?
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.360]  The Apple's Silicon prowess is so central to the
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.360]  AirPod success story and will be central to their
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:21.360]  hopeful success in areas like AR and VR and who knows, you know,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  what else or Apple watch is another great example, right?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]  Oh yeah. Goodness. Right. Yeah.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:29.360]  I'd love you to go back and claim chowder what people said when Apple bought PA
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.360]  semi, I think you've done it before. It is, it is. People were like,
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.360]  why would Apple get into Silicon? How can they compete?
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.360]  You know, and you know, that's,
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.360]  that was the beginning of the end for Intel's ability to lead the industry.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360]  Although maybe it's,
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.360]  there's some talk about maybe where they're at now is a better place,
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.360]  but it just seemed impossible at a computer manufacturer,
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.360]  especially one at Apple size at that time,
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.360]  despite them already throwing off tens of billions of dollars in cash a year,
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360]  they were still relatively small.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.360]  And the fact that they've been able to custom engineer chips
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  that have produced those kinds of gains.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.360]  But, and I think it's like this, it's to several points, right?
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.360]  Not only do they have,
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.360]  were they able to make a better mobile chip and then,
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.360]  and then integrate system on a chip design that makes for even better
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  efficiency,
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.360]  not only are they able to create the M one and produce a chip that is that,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360]  I mean, it is hilarious.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.360]  Your site's one of the better places to find these comparisons,
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.360]  but to see the people who are in the non Apple world,
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  try to justify that the M one or two is not as good as it claims by looking at
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.360]  windows, laptops and limit, whatever. It's just so funny. You're like, no,
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:37.360]  I'm sorry. You're going to have to change your worldview. I was, I never,
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  when the M one came out, I really didn't believe it.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.360]  I actually had to own a machine before I truly accepted what a change it was.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.360]  And I'm like all in an Apple. I've been using Apple products since 1985.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  I'm not, I'm not even dubious. And I was still like, okay, this,
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.360]  this is more of a game changer than I thought. But so it's not only that,
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.360]  but it's also that they can produce these micro chips that, you know,
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.360]  these tiny microchips, I should say that allow them to do these, you know,
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  to do the air pods. And, and that's what the glasses,
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  if Apple releases glasses,
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.360]  you can imagine it's going to have the I've style thing of like,
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  we've packed in the battery into the stems and like the, you know,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360]  all the custom circuitry.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]  So you're going to wear a pair of maybe slightly chunky,
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  but very stylishable black, you know,
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.360]  black glasses and then the frame is going to be a hundred percent full of
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.360]  electronics or something, right. With induction charging in the stems or whatever.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.360]  Yeah. I'm,
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.360]  I'm guessing that they're just going to stuff little tiny thin batteries all
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]  throughout the glass.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.360]  Absolutely. Every, every corner, every edge. And then the,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.360]  the lenses I assume will be multi lens or multi layer LCD panels
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:48.360]  interlaced with other kinds of probably more exotic stuff that get managed by
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.360]  the microcomputers and the multiple computers probably running it. But you know,
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.360]  then you're like, well, where do you put the processor? It's like, well,
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.360]  they'll have designed some new chip form factor probably to stick the package in
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.360]  the right spot with like a regular pair of eyeglasses.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.360]  It's like if you sit on your glasses or something and break the arm off,
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360]  you know, and it's like, Oh,
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.360]  you go back to your eyeglass place and you pay a nominal fee. It's like,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.360]  I'm sure with the Apple glasses, it might look like a normal pair of glasses,
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360]  but it'll be like,
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.360]  it's like when you break the back of your iPhone and it's like how many
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360]  hundred dollars? And it's like,
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.360]  if you just break the side off your Apple glasses, it'll, you know,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.360]  it'll be like, Oh, $250 just for the arm. It's like, Oh yeah,
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  well there's all sorts of stuff in there.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.360]  Apple's been prepping us with the changes to Apple care though,
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.360]  where they're like, Oh, well now we're including an incident for this much.
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360]  Oh, well accidents are included. I'm like, yeah, yeah,
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  you're going to have to Apple glasses are going to have to have a very
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.360]  generous Apple care plan, at least the early days to get people to go in on it.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.360]  Yeah. Anyway, before we leave the subject,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.360]  the thing, one of the things I'm looking forward to 2023 is to me,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.360]  Apple is very clearly a company of annual patterns and we still don't know
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.360]  what their pattern is for Apple Silicon max, right?
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.360]  It's we've only gotten a second generation device.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.360]  The only ones that we have are the Mac book air and the low end non pro 13
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.360]  inch Mac book pro, you know, the Mac book air in a,
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.360]  in a thicker chassis.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  What is the pattern for the rest of Apple Silicon because the one device we
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  know is on an annual schedule is the iPhone, right? Every year,
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.360]  every September there's a new iPhone and a new generation of a series chips,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360]  but everything else,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:31.360]  including the iPad is seemingly more like an 18 month schedule, right?
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360]  So iPads, all iPads,
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.360]  none of them get update updated annually even though they've been on Apple
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  Silicon forever. And it just,
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  the thing that makes it seem unusual to me is that they're going with this
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.360]  numbered M one M two integer pattern.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.360]  But I think that there will be max that skip generations,
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]  right? That maybe,
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.360]  you know, there won't be a Mac book pro that gets every single M generation,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.360]  you know, that at some point it's going to skip a generation. Who knows?
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.360]  And obviously the Mac pro obviously skipped the M one generation and
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.360]  well, think about what you said earlier too, is that you don't need a Mac pro.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.360]  You've got a Mac book pro, right? This is your,
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.360]  and I asked this question to people from time to time is,
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.360]  is what is the end of upgrades, right? It's like my,
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.360]  I have an M one like first generation Mac book air with 16 gigs of Ram.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.360]  And I only have a half a gigabyte, sorry,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.360]  half a terabyte rather half a gigabyte of storage on it.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.360]  And I wish it just seemed like too much money at the time to get a terabyte.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.360]  But between iCloud and other things, I make it work.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360]  So the only thing I'm short on is storage.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360]  The only thing that would probably get me to upgrade.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.360]  I don't know when I will stop using my M one Mac book air because I don't,
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.360]  I actually, for the first time in the history of owning laptops,
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.360]  I don't need a faster one. Everything I need to do,
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.360]  I can do at the speed I need to do it more or less.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.360]  And I've done things like layout or work with giant InDesign files on it
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.360]  where it's been essentially full speed, like real time, very little lag.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.360]  And that was even before Apple had fully transitioned to native,
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]  native Apple solution.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.360]  So this is my question is like maybe Apple doesn't have to be on the same kind
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.360]  of cycle for many of the machines because it's got,
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.360]  it's not terminal models, but the models are, you know,
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.360]  what if they don't, if it's good enough for a couple of years and maybe people,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:33.360]  I mean,
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.360]  I don't think Apple wants people to own their computers necessarily for five to
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360]  seven years,
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.360]  but you look at the history of how of ownership and kind of the support number
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.360]  of support you have,
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.360]  Apple's put it in Mac OS and it's like maybe we are going to see that
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.360]  lengthening that reduces their revenue from max except that they're expanding
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.360]  the Mac audience all the time and they still have, you know,
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.360]  a hundred million people who need to upgrade to M machines who haven't yet.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.360]  So it feels like they could probably not worry as much about the speed of
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.360]  revision of max and just keep focusing on why you should get the latest one.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360]  If you have a machine that's, you know,
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:13.360]  three to seven years out of cycle. Yeah, I think so too.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.360]  And I think they're very comfortable with the idea that PCs when the Mac is
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360]  their PC as a, as a, you know,
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.360]  literally 40 year old category that,
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.360]  that a four or five year upgrade cycle is fine,
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.360]  especially since they've, they've held the line on prices, right?
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360]  Where the,
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.360]  the low end Mac book air is still not as high as it used to be.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.360]  The, the low end Mac book air is still nine 99,
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:45.360]  even as the rest of the industry is sort of filtered down to
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.360]  these three and $400 low end laptops,
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.360]  Apple holding the line at a thousand dollars and selling most of these,
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:58.360]  you know, the, the 14 and 16 inch Mac book pros start at $2,000
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.360]  effectively. And really the, the configurations most people are buying,
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360]  I think are closer to $3,000,
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.360]  which in today's PC world is very expensive, you know,
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:10.360]  and I think that they're just fine selling.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.360]  They're very happy to sell you a $2,800 Mac book pro that you won't,
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.360]  that you won't even think about upgrading for four years, you know,
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.360]  with a 30 something percent margin. So they're like, that's fine.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  We paid our money off you. And then, and this is the growth of this.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360]  This is what I get. You got to bring this up, right?
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360]  We forget to do this sometimes that Apple is a services company now.
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  And of course they care less.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.360]  They have shifted enough people over to buying from the Mac app store. And,
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  you know, I'm ponying out that whatever the Apple one subscription is,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  I don't,
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  I don't know what it costs because it's less than it costs before for me to
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.360]  buy all those things separately. And my family gets everything.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.360]  Cause I'm on family sharing. So they, they're getting, I don't know,
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.360]  $400 a year for me for Apple one. And I'm super happy about it.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.360]  I don't have any complaint about the price for the services provided.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.360]  Yeah, I agree. I do. I do agree. All right.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.360]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:03.360]  It's our good friends at collide K O L I D E.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.360]  If you are listening to this podcast,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.360]  the odds are very good that at some point you or your company are going to go
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.360]  through an audit like SOC two or ISO 27,
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.360]  zero zero one. And when you do,
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:20.360]  you'll have to answer some tough questions about end point security questions
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.360]  like do all your company laptops have their discs encrypted?
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.360]  Does everyone have the company's password manager installed?
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.360]  Do you have a system in place to monitor and maintain compliance throughout
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.360]  your cross platform fleet of PCs? If,
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.360]  even if you're confident that you can answer all those questions. Yes.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:45.360]  The bigger question when you're faced with an audit is can you prove it?
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.360]  If you're not quite sure how you'd go about proving compliance,
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360]  you need collide.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:55.360]  Collide is an end point security tool for Mac windows and now
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.360]  Linux devices that does things that MDMs can't and gives you the visibility
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.360]  you need to achieve and maintain and prove compliance. Best of all,
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  collide does not resort to surveilling employees or locking down devices.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360]  Instead, it works with end users to resolve issues and relies on their
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360]  cooperation and informed consent.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  You can meet your security goals and pass your audit without compromising on
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.360]  privacy. Visit collide.com slash the talk show.

[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.360]  I want to talk, speaking of password security. Oh man.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.360]  LastPass has had,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.360]  I would say a week that would make Southwest airlines seem like they've had a
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.360]  good, a good week.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.360]  Yeah. Holy cow. You know, it's funny.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360]  There's one of these things of like where you list off, well,
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.360]  what password managers do people use? And it's like, well, you'll be like,
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:06.360]  Oh, there's one password. You know, there's a built-in one in iCloud keychain.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.360]  You can use that in all of Apple products, but it's not, you know,
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  it's not good outside the ecosystem. Like, well, there's, you know, last pass,
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.360]  there's dash lane, there's, you start listing off others. Right.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.360]  But last pass has always been kind of in that list and I don't know that it's
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]  going to be in that list anymore. Like I don't think,
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.360]  I don't think it should be. And I think there's a lot of reasons why it's not
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.360]  because they were hacked. That's bad.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.360]  They made a number of operational mistakes that they've admitted some of
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360]  clearly. But the problem is I think,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.360]  I think it is embarrassing to have master password based security as your only
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.360]  line of defense in 2022 or maybe in 2015.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.360]  Right. And this is what's come out and I didn't realize this cause I haven't
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  used last pass and I haven't looked at the security for a while when I was,
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.360]  since I was doing kind of more technical encryption looks and last pass,
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360]  you know, so every other, so I shouldn't say every other,
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.360]  all the major password and secret management services out there you're likely
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.360]  to use. And I will cite again,
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.360]  Apple's iCloud keychain operation and one password in particular.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  Cause I know those more, more in depth.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360]  I know there are others like this that are more specialized.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.360]  People call it bit warden, which is an open source project that has not needs
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360]  more apparently outside auditing.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  They need to raise money to do certain things for more assurance. But again,
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360]  it's an option that's designed around this.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.360]  You need to have device based key material mix into anything so that if your
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.360]  archive is in a cloud storage environment and it's compromised that without
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.360]  access to the devices and the ability to unlock a device.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.360]  So it's a physical proximity attack.
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.360]  Typically unless you're a sophisticated nation state actor who could remotely
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.360]  install expensive one time use zero days to crack your phone and extract device
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.360]  keys,
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.360]  which isn't even possible in a secure enclave environment in most circumstances,
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.360]  right? Blah, blah, blah.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:55.360]  It's long list of things that you're still secure, right?
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.360]  So if you're one password vault, if one password had a massive,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.360]  massive attack,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:04.360]  some horrible thing happened and all of their cloud stored vaults that they sync
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.360]  for users and give access to through web apps were stolen.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.360]  There is zero risk that anyone's material would ever be decrypted because you
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.360]  must have the secret keys that are device stored, right? And that's that.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.360]  If all of your,
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  if Apple had an iCloud breach and all of its end to end security information,
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  including iCloud key chains were stolen and somebody had a billion years to work
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  on it,
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.360]  they're not going to decrypt it because you need the keys stored only in secure
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  enclave and all of your Apple devices. It's absolutely, you know,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.360]  unless there was some exploit we don't know about and the design would be very
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.360]  difficult to deal with, with last pass.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360]  If somebody steals your last pass vault,
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  which bazillion were just lost and can guess through brute force,
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.360]  your your master password, it's totally decrypted and that's it. Boom.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]  That's the story.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.360]  Yeah. That's a great summary. And the problem with that is that
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.360]  the, I think, and I read a lot about this this week,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.360]  but I think the problem is that with, with all of these vaults, I mean,
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.360]  I guess millions, I don't, I'm not quite sure how many customers they have,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.360]  but you know, all of them, you know, the vaults are lost or,
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.360]  or have been taken,
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.360]  but they are secured by the user's own master password.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.360]  Right. So it is computationally unfeasible for anybody in possession of all of
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  those vaults to decrypt, certainly all of them,
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.360]  but even to mass attack all of these stored vaults.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.360]  But if they wanted to target specific users,
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.360]  it's computationally feasible to,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360]  and especially, you know,
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.360]  if some of these users don't have super long,
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360]  super secure master passwords, you know,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  or if the master password was secured by the previous, this whole thing,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360]  you know, some listeners will get this and some won't,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  and it's a deep cryptographic thing,
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.360]  but it's like the number of rounds of hashing you do on a, on a password.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  So you type in your password, you type in John Gruber rocks, right?
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  And it gets, that's not a good password. Don't use it folks.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360]  It has to be longer. It has to be longer than random.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:12.360]  But I do appreciate the sentiment. So if that was your password, I do.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.360]  I thank you for selecting it, but go change it.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.360]  Go change it immediately folks.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.360]  So you type that in and then the hashing algorithm, the way a hash works,
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.360]  it's a one way cryptographic function.
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  So you put in one thing and the thing that comes up the other end is
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.360]  essentially deterministically manipulated,
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  but you can't reverse it without an enormous asymmetrical amount of computational power.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.360]  So you do that once, that can be really strong.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.360]  That's how SHA-2 and these other things used for certain kinds of password storage work.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.360]  But you could also, if you want to increase the difficulty,
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  you can use something, use an iterative routine.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  So instead of just hashing it once, you hash it, you know,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  5,000 times, a hundred thousand times, 200,000 times,
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.360]  and each, I should say the SHA-2 algorithm includes that as part of it,
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.360]  the number of hashing operations that occur, but it's part of an algorithm, right?
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.360]  So one password has its approach, LastPass, others have their approaches,
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.360]  and you can wind up if you haven't updated,
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.360]  people have been finding as they look through their settings at LastPass,
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  that they are set to, you know, 5,000 iterations where LastPass now,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.360]  I think the current setting is like a hundred thousand and one hundred iterations.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.360]  And 5,000 is much easier to crack than the hundred thousand,
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.360]  and you can set it higher even.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.360]  So there's the master password length and complexity.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.360]  There's the amount of entropy in it, right?
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.360]  So how hard is it to crack?
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.360]  There's the sort of social engineering guessability.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.360]  And then there's the, even if you have a really good password,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:42.360]  your master password, if it hasn't been iterated a sufficient number of times,
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]  it can also be trivial.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  And John, you saw this, I didn't know this.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  They don't encrypt the URLs in your password storage.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  So that is going to leak.
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  So if you're asking, so you say, what you said is valid.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.360]  They have some information and account information leaked.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  So it's possible that a cracker would be able to match up a user with a vault,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.360]  either through some leaked metadata about the account,
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.360]  or failing that through looking at URLs,
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.360]  because some of those URLs are going to contain encoded information
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  about your user ID at an account,
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  because the URL is improperly anonymized in the way that any given site.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  You have a thousand passwords,
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.360]  and some sites will encode your username into it conceivably,
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.360]  or maybe your email address.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.360]  So in a different circumstance, if everything in the vault were encrypted
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.360]  and no metadata were available in an unencrypted form,
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.360]  then the vaults might still be fairly useless to other people,
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.360]  even the ones that are weakly protected,
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360]  because it might be impossible for a cracker to know
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.360]  which ones were weakly protected,
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360]  so they'd have to go through a lot of work
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:49.360]  even to figure out which ones they could start to crack.
[01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  But that's not the case.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.360]  Anyway, bad news for LastPass.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.360]  I don't know about you.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.360]  I, you know, in terms of what I use,
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.360]  I honestly have mostly, overwhelmingly,
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.360]  I would say rely on iCloud Keychain.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.360]  And I've trusted it for numerous years,
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:17.360]  and over one of the things I did last year in 2022
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.360]  was I moved most, almost all of my two-factor authentication codes,
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.360]  like when you get those, oh, as a second factor,
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.360]  go to Google Authenticator or Authy or any number of,
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.360]  you know, there's an open protocol for generating these things,
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.360]  and then once a minute you get a new six-digit code
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.360]  and you need to enter the current minutes six-digit code
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.360]  for this account as your second factor to get in.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.360]  I moved most of those to iCloud Keychain,
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.360]  which started supporting those over a year ago,
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.360]  and I couldn't be happier.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:59.360]  And I know that there's a lot of people out there who don't,
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.360]  A, one reason not to go all in with iCloud Keychain
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.360]  is if you have cross-platform needs,
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.360]  if you use Windows regularly,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.360]  or you want to use Android regularly or need to,
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:19.360]  or just want to maintain your ability to do that in the future.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.360]  And, you know, you obviously can back out of iCloud Keychain
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.360]  and switch from iCloud Keychain to 1Password
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.360]  or something else that's cross-platform in the future,
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.360]  but if you already have all your two-factor codes
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.360]  in Authy or Google Authenticator and want to keep them there,
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.360]  not because you think it's the best interface for them
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.360]  or the most convenient, but because you like the idea
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:48.360]  that that's a cross-platform way to do it, I totally get that.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:53.360]  But me, personally, I'm so all in on the Apple ecosystem,
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:57.360]  including Safari as my main browser,
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.360]  that the integration with iCloud Keychain is just phenomenal.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:07.360]  And I know that there's a lot of people who hear Apple
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.360]  and cloud-based syncing and think it's always a disaster.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.360]  And, you know, this is not my first rodeo.
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.360]  You know, I've seen Apple's struggles with cloud-based syncing
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:23.360]  firsthand over a long number of years.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.360]  I will say, as somebody who's been pretty much all in
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:32.360]  on iCloud Keychain for years, the syncing with iCloud Keychain
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.360]  is as good as any syncing I've seen for any product anywhere.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.360]  And, you know, I'm not personally vouching
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:42.360]  that they're never going to have a sync problem, you know,
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.360]  that would be catastrophic for people.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.360]  And for my very most important accounts,
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:53.360]  I've got saved codes printed out and stored in a safe location.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.360]  And, you know, an iCloud Keychain catastrophe
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.360]  would be very, very annoying to me.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.360]  And I might have a problem.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.360]  There might be some accounts where I'm not really,
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.360]  I haven't thought it through, and I might be locked out
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360]  and need, I don't know what I would, you know.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.360]  But for the ones that I'm most concerned about,
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.360]  I know that I could recover even if I lost access
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.360]  to iCloud Keychain with recovery codes, et cetera,
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.360]  and I've never needed to.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.360]  And the integration with Safari
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.360]  and all the things I would want my password manager to do,
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:31.360]  I couldn't be happier.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.360]  And, you know, I know a couple of the people
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.360]  who work on that team at Apple.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.360]  I think it is, for lack of a better term,
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:39.360]  one of Apple's A teams.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.360]  I think they take it with the utmost, you know, care.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.360]  And it's, you know, it's one of Apple's A teams
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.360]  working on that, and it just keeps getting better.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:51.360]  I don't know, what do you use?
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.360]  I have been moving, I've used Authy for my,
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360]  what are they, T-O-T-Ps.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.360]  Yeah.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.360]  Time-based, one-time passwords, right?
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.360]  T-O-T-P.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.360]  And I've used that for years,
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.360]  because that was the best, Google Authenticator was a mess,
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360]  because it would, you know, you'd have to restore your phone
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.360]  and you'd lose all your codes.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:07.360]  That was the worst.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.360]  Whatever.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.360]  And so at some point I found Authy,
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.360]  and Twilo owns it now, I don't know if they made it.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.360]  And it's a great, it's free for that purpose.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.360]  There's other stuff they sell, but they don't market you.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:20.360]  And it syncs securely, and it's available.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:21.360]  There's a Mac app that came out.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.360]  It's not great, but it's fine.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.360]  So I used Authy for years and years,
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.360]  and then as soon as the, I guess Apple calls it,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.360]  you know, verification codes or something,
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.360]  when that rolled out with Monterey and iPadOS 15,
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360]  I was documenting it, of course,
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.360]  because I write a book about iPad and iOS security
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360]  and Mac security for the Take Control series.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.360]  And I thought, oh, this is actually really,
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  really well implemented.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360]  It's best when you're using Safari on a Mac,
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.360]  and it's best when you're doing kind of anything
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]  in an app that's correctly integrated
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.360]  or in Safari on iOS and iPadOS devices.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.360]  But, you know, the cross-platform thing,
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]  you can just go on your iPhone,
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.360]  you just go to settings, passwords,
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.360]  search on the thing, and it shows you the verification code.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360]  So, and I've had that issue.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360]  I mean, occasionally there's some Safari integration issues
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.360]  where you can't edit the list of websites
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.360]  to which a verification code applies.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.360]  So I've had some cases in which a site verifies on one site,
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360]  but then when you log in, it has a different subdomain.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360]  So occasionally I've had to go and be like,
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.360]  all right, I've got to go to passwords in macOS
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360]  and bring this up.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.360]  It doesn't give me the auto-fill Touch ID option.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  I confess, and I know I'm not the only person,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.360]  I have a Mac Mini, and I bought a magic keyboard
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.360]  with Touch ID almost, well, first to test,
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.360]  because I write about these things.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.360]  So I needed to own one.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.360]  And now I keep it attached all the time,
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.360]  even though it's not my primary keyboard,
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.360]  because I use Touch ID on my Mac all the time,
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.360]  and it's such a delight compared to passwords
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:50.360]  or reducing security levels that, you know,
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.360]  I'm using Touch ID on my non-laptop Mac for that purpose.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  I know iMac users have had that option all along,
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.360]  but I specifically bought it.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360]  But I think the feature works really well.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.360]  I think the way it's presented,
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.360]  especially in like an in-browser is good.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.360]  I have never, I've never had, you said that,
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360]  and I'm thinking of all the iCloud sync problems
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.360]  I've had with things like photos or calendar events,
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:14.360]  things where I've had to go and do weird,
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.360]  you know, resets or have had no explanation
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360]  why things were wrong for weeks.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.360]  I've never, that I can recall,
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.360]  have an iCloud keychain sync issue,
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360]  and I think it's got a different pathway.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.360]  So I'm sure the data is backed up at iCloud
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.360]  in this secured fashion, but my belief is,
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  I don't remember if this is in the security document or not,
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360]  the iCloud security document,
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  I believe that it's kind of a push to your devices
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  as opposed to like a sync where it kind of accumulates it
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  and then your devices kind of poll and whatever.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.360]  I think iCloud keychain items are essentially
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.360]  device-to-device synced with iCloud as the conduit.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360]  I may be describing that wrong,
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  but it does seem like it is more rapidly done
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360]  and more accurately done than anything else
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.360]  I've ever had trouble with on iCloud.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.360]  Yeah, that's, you know, everybody's experience
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360]  is anecdotal, right?
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.360]  But some things, to me, sync better than others.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:10.360]  I also find that Apple Notes has been,
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  the modern era of Apple Notes,
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.360]  ever since they moved past IMAP as the backend syncing,
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.360]  which was terrible, to be honest.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.360]  I mean, I kind of understand why they did it
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.360]  because it was sort of a shortcut
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.360]  to get syncing of some sort,
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  but when they switched to a native iCloud set of APIs
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.360]  for syncing your notes, it's been rock solid for me.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  I mean, really, really good.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  I kind of get the feeling, you know, in a very obvious way,
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.360]  the way that you would think,
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.360]  hey, I would kind of hope that the iCloud keychain team
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.360]  is extra careful and is there, you know,
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:55.360]  puts an even higher priority on not making mistakes,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.360]  even at the expense of moving slower year over year, right?
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.360]  So, you know, it's fewer new features, move slower,
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.360]  but instead of, you know, take the old carpenter's adage
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.360]  of measure twice, cut once.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  Maybe with something like iCloud keychain,
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360]  you measure 10 times and cut once.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  I learned something amazing about Russia a few decades ago
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360]  from a Russian friend at the time.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.360]  I said, measure twice, cut once.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360]  He said, oh.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.360]  He said, in Russia, we say measure seven times and cut once.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.360]  And I said, oh, wow.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.360]  He said, everything is sevens.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  And I was like, that taught me a lot.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360]  The other thing is, you know, this is the neat feature, right,
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360]  is that because it's integrated,
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.360]  this is probably why you do this,
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360]  and it's why I'm doing it now as well.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360]  I trust what Apple's doing.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.360]  I believe there's security documentation.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.360]  I haven't had negative experiences,
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.360]  and iCloud keychain has worked solidly for me
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  all these years for regular passwords.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360]  I've been using 1Password for many years also,
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.360]  and I use them both in slightly different ways,
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360]  kind of integrated.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  But it shows you the QR code
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360]  when you're doing the two-factor enrollment,
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.360]  and you press and hold on it on a touch device,
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.360]  or you right-click on it in Safari,
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  and it says, add as verification code,
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360]  and that's your setup.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360]  I mean, come on.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  That's the kind of frictionless integration you want,
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360]  and you're like, well, why wouldn't I do that?
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:14.360]  Because now there's issues people worry about,
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.360]  out-of-band issues as well.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.360]  Like, is this protected enough?
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.360]  The classic one that comes up
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  that I get contacted by people about regularly
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]  and I've documented in my books
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.360]  is that when you do two-factor,
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  I mean, it's funny that Apple hasn't adopted TOTPs
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.360]  for its own site.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  It's using its own proprietary
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]  but very high security system
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.360]  that is kind of a two-step authentication
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360]  in order to get a number, right?
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  But when you do a login
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.360]  with a regular username and password,
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.360]  and then it gives you the prompt,
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360]  and it's like, hey, prove who you are here.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.360]  You need to enter this TOTP.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360]  Is this your location?
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  And then one of your devices,
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.360]  you enter the code, right?
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.360]  All that's good.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  You want to trust this device.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360]  People have said to me,
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.360]  well, why should I trust entering a code
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.360]  into the same browser?
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.360]  Like, if I'm on my machine,
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360]  or that the machine is on,
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  so I'm on a browser on my Mac,
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.360]  and the Mac produces the code that Apple sent,
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  and it's like, because it's not in the same band path,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  I'm not on my browser,
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360]  and the browser is sending me my code.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:14.360]  I'm on the browser in a separate Apple system
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.360]  that is, again, device locked.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:18.360]  Like, this is your Apple ID account
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  logged into that Mac through a verified connection
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.360]  that you've already done two-factor authentication on
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:26.360]  for iCloud and Apple ID on your system.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:29.360]  That pathway is being used exclusively
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  over secure transport to present that code to you.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.360]  So it's trustworthy because it's not in browser,
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.360]  and that's the same thing for the verification code.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360]  You're in Safari,
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.360]  and your verification code's in Safari,
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.360]  but there's not a pathway where a website
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.360]  can pull that verification code out.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.360]  It's essentially separate sandbox entities
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.360]  that don't talk to each other.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360]  Yeah, you're the one who explained this to me
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.360]  a few years ago, and I'll always appreciate it.
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  And I'm still not sure I entirely understand it,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  to be honest, but I trust it at this point.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360]  But I'll bet everybody listening to this show
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.360]  has had family members say to them,
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.360]  how does this make sense when I'm logging in?
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  I'm on a MacBook, and I'm logging into an Apple website.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.360]  And to confirm I am who I am,
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.360]  it's the same MacBook saying,
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.360]  is this a login that you want to approve?
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:24.360]  But it is, I guess, the flip side of the coin
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:29.360]  is that it is the sort of counterintuitive way
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  that Apple's privacy initiatives are often in conflict
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360]  with security initiatives.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  And where I'm going with that is that the browser
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.360]  is so private that the browser doesn't tell the website,
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:48.360]  this is the device I'm on, right?
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  This unique identifier for this MacBook.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.360]  No, you don't want your browser to give a unique identifier
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.360]  for your hardware to any website, whether it's Apple's or Google's.
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.360]  But so like you said, it's out of band
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  of the communication of your browser to Apple.com.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  But when Apple says, okay, we'll send a ping
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.360]  to all of your known devices that we trust
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.360]  and that you've vouched for,
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.360]  which includes the MacBook you're on,
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360]  to verify that this is right,
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.360]  then you can just do it right on your MacBook.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360]  And once you understand that,
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:24.360]  that it's sort of an entirely different
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.360]  communication channel between Apple.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:31.360]  Your browser is not your device,
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  but that confirmation is your device saying,
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.360]  yes, this trusted device is saying that this is okay.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  It's because the browser to regular people, right,
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:44.360]  the browser and your operating system appear to be monolithic.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  They're all the same thing.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.360]  Apple doesn't trust the browser, but it trusts your device.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360]  So it's weird when it's like,
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360]  well, if you don't trust my browser,
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.360]  why are you trusting this?
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:55.360]  It's like, ah, the browser's untrustworthy,
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  so you could be phished.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360]  And the thing to remember is it's not the Safari
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.360]  or any other browser, whatever,
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:06.360]  but it's not Safari prompting you with that map
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.360]  that says, oh, there's a login from somewhere.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.360]  That's the system doing it, which is out of it.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.360]  But it can feel like it.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.360]  This is with advanced data protection, right,
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.360]  the newest thing, which I think is super cool.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  I assumed when I saw the first press release about it,
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360]  oh, you won't be able to access your data
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.360]  on iCloud.com anymore
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.360]  because it's all going to be end-to-end encrypted.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.360]  But no, Apple will let you do it.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.360]  I don't know, I've turned over a test account.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360]  I turned ADP on it so I could test it.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.360]  And you go to the website, iCloud.com,
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.360]  it says, hey, all your data except your email contacts
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  and calendar entries are protected by ADP.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  Do you want to access it?
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.360]  And if you say yes, it does push to one of your devices
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.360]  that lets you enter a key that then allows it
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.360]  to decrypt temporarily within the browser
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  the data that's sent from iCloud.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360]  So the data is still encrypted at iCloud.
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360]  It's sent to your browser, cached in your browser,
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.360]  and decrypting your browser with that temporary key.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.360]  And that is very clever.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.360]  That's what 1Password does, for instance,
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.360]  when you use 1Password.com
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.360]  to access your end-to-end encrypted stuff.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.360]  It's never receiving the password.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.360]  All the password access, all the password interaction
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.360]  is local to your browser cache, so it's never transmitted.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.360]  And so I thought, I knew 1Password was doing that,
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.360]  but so Apple has found that trustworthy enough, apparently,
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360]  that they're willing to let you do that.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.360]  So if you enable ADP, which I think is,
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  there's pros and cons, but it could be very good
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.360]  as just an extra level of privacy and security,
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.360]  then you are not excluded from using iCloud.com
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:39.360]  for data for those newly protected categories,
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360]  which is cool.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  But counterintuitive.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360]  Yeah, and you could also, did you notice this little,
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.360]  there's like a little switch, too.
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360]  You can also now, if you choose,
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.360]  whether or not you have ADP turned on,
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.360]  you can separately choose in iOS 6,
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360]  let's do all the numbers, right?
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.360]  It's Mac OS 13.1 Ventura,
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.360]  iOS 16.2, iPad OS 16.2.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.360]  So if you have an option for ADP in the US,
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.360]  or you're at any of those versions worldwide,
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.360]  you can now disable iCloud.com access for your account.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.360]  And that's separate from ADP.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.360]  Yeah, it's a little subtle thing.
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.360]  I noticed it.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.360]  I was like, wait, what is this?
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.360]  And it's, so you can have the normal encryption
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:21.360]  where some of your stuff is encrypted at rest
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  and some end to end, like it is for almost everybody today.
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360]  And you're like, I don't want to expose a phishing risk
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360]  or any other risk to iCloud.com,
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.360]  so I'm just going to turn that off.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.360]  And if you turn it off, you can turn it back on,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.360]  but you can only do that from devices.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.360]  You can't do it from a website.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.360]  So it's a different security choice,
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.360]  but it's an interesting one.
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360]  Yeah.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.360]  And it doesn't disable any syncing either.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360]  Yeah, and the one thing I can think of
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:48.360]  that that would do is it puts your device security
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:49.360]  in front of everything, right?
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360]  Yes.
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.360]  So all of your Apple devices have face ID
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.360]  or a passcode or your Mac has a password and touch ID,
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.360]  but there's no way to get into anything
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.360]  without getting into the device first,
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.360]  whereas iCloud, you can use a Apple ID and a password.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.360]  And then a phone number.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:11.360]  Yeah.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.360]  You can use your backup,
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.360]  because Apple is still letting you do backup SMS
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.360]  and automated voice calls.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.360]  So if somebody were to, I mean, it's a lot of steps,
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.360]  but if someone were to hijack a SIM,
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.360]  for instance, at a cell phone company,
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.360]  then they might be able to crack your iCloud
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.360]  through iCloud.com access.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:30.360]  But with this method, someone could,
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.360]  I mean, they could log into certain services
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:36.360]  without a device because they could still use an SMS method,
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360]  but it wouldn't provide them the same amount of control.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.360]  Yeah.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:40.360]  I think that for most people,
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:44.360]  I certainly am going to leave iCloud.com access for me on,
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.360]  and I think for most people that's right.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.360]  But you can, you know, it's not too hard to squint your eyes
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.360]  and see how it's more secure to just turn that off
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.360]  if you're genuinely paranoid
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:59.360]  or if you actually suspect that you're more likely to be attacked.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.360]  Apple's now doing this tiered thing.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360]  You've got lockdown mode at the top.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  You've got the new iMessage feature
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.360]  that'll roll out this year that warns you of potential
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.360]  that there are people have intercepted
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:11.360]  or they have sniffers in the middle of an iMessage conversation.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360]  There's iMessage out of band confirmation
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.360]  for identity coming in 2023.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.360]  That's the top.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  Then you have ADP below that,
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.360]  and then below that is iCloud.com access on or off,
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.360]  and below that is fundamental at-rest device-based security
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:29.360]  with some elements for iCloud syncing being end-to-end encrypted
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360]  besides those data parts.
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.360]  So it's a good layer of cake that's been built now.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.360]  It still makes me laugh thinking back to the original iPhone
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.360]  and it was just slide to unlock.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.360]  Yes. Oh, right. No password. No passcode, right?
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.360]  Well, you could set a password, I believe, right?
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.360]  But it wasn't part of the golden
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.360]  this is the way we intend you to use the device.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.360]  And I certainly didn't have a passcode on my iPhone
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.360]  for a couple of years.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.360]  No, because slide to unlock was way too cool.
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.360]  But once you slid to unlock, you just had all my email,
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360]  had all your messages.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.360]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.360]  and thank our third and final sponsor of the day.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.360]  It is our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.360]  Oh, Squarespace is the all-in-one platform

[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.360]  They've got member areas.
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  They make it easy for creators to monetize their content
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360]  and expertise in a way that fits their brand.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.360]  With member areas, you can unlock
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  a new revenue stream for your business
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.360]  and free up time in your schedule
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.360]  by selling access to gated content
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.360]  like videos, online courses, or even newsletters.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  They've got built-in analytics.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:51.360]  You can see where people are going on your website,
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  where they're coming from,
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.360]  which sections of your site are popular,
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.360]  which sections are not popular.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.360]  Just a terrific interface for that.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.360]  Online stores, you can sell anything,
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.360]  and they've got it all,
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.360]  from setting up the images and the catalog
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:07.360]  of the items you want to sell
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.360]  to actual processing of the credit cards
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.360]  and all of that e-commerce stuff,
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.360]  all built into Squarespace.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.360]  They've got it all.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.360]  They've got custom templates.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.360]  Get started with the best-in-class templates,
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  and you can customize them to fit your needs,
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.360]  change the fonts, change the colors,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.360]  change the graphics, or just use the templates as is.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  There are hundreds to choose from.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  It's just terrific.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:36.360]  You go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  Squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.360]  You go there.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.360]  You get a 30-day free trial, no limits,
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.360]  no watermarks on the site as you build it,
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.360]  and then when your free trial's up
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  and you're ready to launch,
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360]  just use that same offer code talk show,
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.360]  and you save 10% off your first purchase,
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.360]  including prepaying for up to an entire year.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:01.360]  Just go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:05.360]  Last on my list was, well, let me talk about this.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360]  I want to talk a little bit about Twitter and Mastodon
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.360]  because I know people are tired
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.360]  of talking about Twitter and Musk.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.360]  I'm tired of it, too, but it's fascinating.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  Here, parlaying off our security discussion,
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  so I've been a Twitter Blue subscriber for most of the year.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.360]  I think it came out earlier in 2022.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.360]  It was a $3-a-month product that I happily paid for
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.360]  to get the top articles feature.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.360]  I like the being able to have 30 seconds
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  to revert your thing before it went out.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  I forgot that that was,
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.360]  I did not realize that was a Twitter Blue feature,
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.360]  even though, so, and it's like,
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.360]  I still do most of my Twitter use from Tweetbot,
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.360]  so I don't, and the third party doesn't have it,
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.360]  but I use the first-party app enough that I,
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  you know, I've seen that feature.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:57.360]  Editing tweets is only a Twitter Blue feature.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:01.360]  The top articles feature is, it's like Nuzzle used to be,
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  but basically, it's a very simple concept,
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  and to me, Twitter is at its best
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.360]  when its features are very easily explained,
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.360]  but the basic idea is all the people who you follow,
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.360]  the people you've chosen to follow,
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.360]  if a number of the people you follow
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.360]  have all tweeted links to the same article,
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.360]  that becomes one of the top articles of the day
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  and you can just go to this page or tab in the app
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  and just see the articles across the web
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.360]  that are the most linked to
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:39.360]  by the people you choose to follow on Twitter,
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.360]  and then they have a second tab,
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:45.360]  which is sort of the second-order version of that,
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.360]  where the people who you follow,
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.360]  who they follow, they're top articles.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  And they had, Twitter had that relationship
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360]  with Paywall Publications,
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.360]  so there were many things you could read through Twitter Blue
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  that you would have needed a subscription.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360]  So yeah, it was my favorite thing since Nuzzle,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.360]  also it's the closest thing.
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.360]  And Nuzzle, to me, was a little bit better
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:10.360]  at populating the list,
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:14.360]  and Nuzzle, one reason for me as a news junkie
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:17.360]  is that with Nuzzle, you could set it to like three hours
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.360]  instead of 24 hours.
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.360]  Twitter's version is a little bit simpler
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.360]  and it's just, you don't get that kind of granularity,
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.360]  but more than made up for the fact that Twitter,
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.360]  unlike Nuzzle, has these partnership deals
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:33.360]  with a lot of websites where you can burst through paywalls
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.360]  and read these articles without being a subscriber.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.360]  Great feature.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.360]  I went through this thing.
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:41.360]  It seems like this is,
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:43.360]  I don't know if it's Apple's fault or Twitter's fault,
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.360]  but I paid for it through the iOS app,
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.360]  so it was going through my iCloud or iTunes account,
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.360]  whatever you want to call it,
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.360]  $2.99 a month, and I don't know,
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.360]  earlier in December, I started getting some kind of error.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.360]  It was inconsistent and it was something,
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.360]  something that my payment method had expired
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.360]  and it didn't make any sense to me
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:08.360]  because I knew that my iCloud...
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:13.360]  I knew that my iTunes credit card was not expired.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.360]  The credit card I have on my iCloud account is,
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.360]  or iTunes account, whatever you want to call it,
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  it's actually an Apple card
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:22.360]  and I know that the expiration date is,
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.360]  I don't know, a year or two in the future,
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.360]  but if any card is going to give me a proper warning
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.360]  when it expires, it's an Apple card, right?
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.360]  But I think what really happened is that now that,
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:39.360]  under Elon Musk, the new Twitter blew,
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:42.360]  which includes verification checkmark,
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.360]  which I have but I didn't even ask for
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:47.360]  and I honestly don't care about.
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.360]  Honestly, you could take away the blue checkmark
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.360]  on my at Gruber account and I really don't care.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.360]  That's not why I want to pay for it.
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:57.360]  But I think what happened is now that the new version
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.360]  of Twitter blew is $8 a month
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.360]  if you pay Twitter directly on their website
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.360]  and $11 a month through the app
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:08.360]  to account for the 30% cut that Apple takes
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.360]  and for a while it seemed like maybe they'd grandfathered in
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:15.360]  those of us who'd been paying $3 a month
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.360]  but I think they...
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:17.360]  I think they wanted...
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.360]  I think they messily very...
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.360]  Can you believe it under Elon Musk
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.360]  that something was slapdash and haphazard
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360]  and not entirely?
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360]  No, I thought so.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.360]  But I think that basically they wanted to cut all of us off
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.360]  who were paying $3 a month
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.360]  and make us pay $8 or $11 a month,
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.360]  but the error message was about the payment credentials
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:41.360]  being expired, which...
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.360]  They probably just dumped all the tokens,
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:46.360]  the receipt tokens from their database
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  and let it just error out to annoy people like us.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.360]  I let mine lapse before that,
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.360]  a little bit before that point.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.360]  But I'm so keen on the top articles feature
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360]  that I wanted to resubscribe.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.360]  I was like, okay, I'll resubscribe.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.360]  I don't know if you saw this.
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.360]  I tweeted it the other day,
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.360]  but they won't let me.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.360]  They won't let me sign up.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.360]  I want to give Twitter $11 a month
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:11.360]  because I'd actually would rather pay for it
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  through iTunes and no better control.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.360]  I'll pay three more dollars a month
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  knowing that I can cancel at any time through iTunes
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.360]  than to, especially at this point,
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.360]  trust Twitter with my credit card
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.360]  and a recurring subscription.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.360]  I would like to pay $11 a month to them for this
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.360]  and they won't let me
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.360]  because the phone number I have associated
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.360]  with my Twitter account is from an unsupported carrier.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:39.360]  And now what that means...
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:42.360]  Now, the carrier in question is Google Voice.
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.360]  Oh, oh.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.360]  Now, and I tweeted about it
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360]  and people are like, well, that's like a security thing
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:50.360]  because lots of scammers sign up for Google Voice is free.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.360]  You get a phone number for free and...
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:53.360]  Oh, crying out.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.360]  But the reason I use a Google Voice account,
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  I use this Google Voice account
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:03.360]  for pretty much anything that only supports SMS
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.360]  as a second factor, which is actually not very secure
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:09.360]  and not, you know...
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.360]  Yeah, because you can get the codes via email, right?
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  Well, and you can also...
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:13.360]  Or log in.
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.360]  And I do think carriers,
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.360]  especially the big ones like Verizon and AT&T
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  and T-Mobile have, I think,
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:25.360]  certainly anecdotally, it seems like SIM hijacking
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  is less of a thing that they've...
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  But I still don't trust...
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.360]  I'm on Verizon. I've been on Verizon for a while.
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.360]  I trust Google with my main Google account security
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  way more than I trust Verizon
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.360]  and way more than I trust somebody.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.360]  I honestly don't see how it's feasible
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.360]  that somebody could hijack my Google account.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.360]  And whereas I don't necessarily trust
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  that somebody who specifically wanted to target me,
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.360]  John Gruber, the Daring Fireball guy
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  who has 300,000 followers on Twitter,
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.360]  somebody could go into a Verizon store and say,
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:03.360]  I'm John Gruber and this is my phone number
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:06.360]  and it's not that hard to get my personal cell phone number.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.360]  I lost my... I need a new SIM card.
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:11.360]  I trust Google more than I trust Verizon with that,
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.360]  even though I more or less trust Verizon.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  All the carriers put ID,
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  the possibility but not requirement
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  for an ID code to protect that.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.360]  And so if you don't have an ID code
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:26.360]  set on your wireless account, then that's possible,
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.360]  although they're having stories of people
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  also social engineering around the requirement for an ID.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.360]  But I think that's why the incidence has gone down.
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:35.360]  It's also because Bitcoin is worth less,
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:38.360]  so people have less interest in hacking than most people.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  But I think the ID thing was enough of a deterrent
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360]  that it became less low hanging fruit.
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.360]  But I think also if you went in with a...
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.360]  Someone went in with a faked bill and a faked ID
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  and said they were John Gruber and had your phone number,
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.360]  they might still be able to talk somebody into it.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.360]  That's not implausible.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.360]  I just feel safer with my Google account.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.360]  I have lots of complaints
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.360]  about Google's overall customer experience,
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.360]  but I think Google's account security
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  is top notch.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  And if I have to use SMS as a second factor,
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.360]  I always use my Google Voice account if possible.
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.360]  And I do have my Google Voice account set up
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.360]  to forward all text messages to my main email.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.360]  So when they do text me, quote, unquote,
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.360]  text me a six-digit code,
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:29.360]  all I have to do is look at my email and it's right there.
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  And it's just as easy as checking it from an SMS message.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  Super frustrating.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  And it's so funny because it's one of the times
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.360]  where I've run into the...
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  And I hate to...
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  I tried never to use the word fanboy,
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360]  but I can't think of a better term.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.360]  The Elon Musk fanboys who took the...
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:51.360]  Well, of course they don't allow Google Voice.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.360]  It keeps the scammers out.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.360]  Well, then how come I use my Google Voice number
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:01.360]  with everything else with no problem and I'm not hacked?
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:09.360]  And to me, it's just a sign of slipshottedness at Twitter.
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  Very frustrating to me.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.360]  You know, Jon, I didn't see your tweet
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.360]  because I haven't been using Twitter since November 20th.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.360]  I ain't going back unless there's some big changes over there.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.360]  And you know me, I have like Twitter poisoning.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.360]  Like you could take a blood sample from me
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.360]  and I'm above 0.08 Twitter percentage
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.360]  and then you give a Twitter C or something,
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.360]  Twitter active alcohol content.
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:32.360]  And I just said I can't be on this service.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:33.360]  I mean, I left Facebook
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.360]  when I felt like they were enabling genocide
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.360]  and I left a couple of years ago.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:38.360]  I was like, that's it.
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:39.360]  And I miss people.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.360]  I miss Twitter as a social mechanism.
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.360]  But I'm benefiting from the fact
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:47.360]  that there's a land of refugees that's polite and kind
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:50.360]  and everything is chirping birds and rainbows for this minute.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:53.360]  And the Mastodon and the Fediverse have been pretty good.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.360]  And I'll give you one stat,
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.360]  which is I had almost 29,000 followers on Twitter,
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.360]  which I have no idea why
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.360]  because my Twitter handle has never really been associated
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.360]  with any media property.
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:04.360]  So it is all organic.
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.360]  Like somehow I feel like I've amassed it
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:09.360]  by putting peas in a pile on a table
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.360]  until that pile gets really big one at a time.
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:13.360]  But I was like, this is great.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:15.360]  So when I do a project or something, I can announce it
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:16.360]  and I get a little uptake from Twitter.
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:18.360]  It's been great for Kickstarter.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.360]  It's always like I'm looking for a place
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.360]  for good conversation, to learn about things,
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.360]  to hear voices I don't hear otherwise,
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:28.360]  to hear some major political and intellectual figures
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.360]  discuss stuff where they're talking more freely
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:34.360]  and to talk to colleagues and friends and so forth.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.360]  But also projects have always been an important part of it.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.360]  So now over at Mastodon after, I don't know,
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.360]  six months of being a pretty good user over there
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:46.360]  and scraping my Twitter feeds to follow people on Mastodon,
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:50.360]  I have over 7,000 followers on Mastodon or about 25%.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.360]  And for me, that's a lot because they're,
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:53.360]  A, they're all real people.
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.360]  It's not bots and it's not random.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.360]  People are making a much more intentional effort
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.360]  to follow people.
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:00.360]  And so there's great conversation there
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:03.360]  and I'm really enjoying this burgeoning community
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.360]  and worried at what point it becomes untenable
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:08.360]  or moderation becomes an issue or balkanization
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.360]  or other things.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.360]  But the real test will be the next time I launch a project
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.360]  and does anything happen?
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.360]  Do I launch something there?
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.360]  And on Twitter, it would have been like a third
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.360]  of the purchases or interest or whatever come from Twitter.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:24.360]  And with Mastodon, it's like one person out of 1,000
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:25.360]  or something.
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:27.360]  Does a project fail because I'm not on Twitter anymore?
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:31.360]  So that's like my professional concern,
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:33.360]  but personally, I'm really enjoying being
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.360]  in a mellower place right now.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.360]  For the record, I just looked it up.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:40.360]  Glenn, your Twitter account, which is, I guess,
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.360]  we could call it hibernating, right?
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.360]  Yes, exactly.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.360]  I'm doing the Darth.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:48.360]  I don't pass judgment, I really don't,
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:51.360]  on anybody who deleted their Twitter account.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.360]  No, and vice versa.
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:56.360]  But if you asked my advice personally,
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:59.360]  I would say just stop using it
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:02.360]  and let your old tweets stay there for reference.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.360]  Oh, that's what I'm doing.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.360]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.360]  Elon could be a temporary phenomenon
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:11.360]  and I don't want to give up on Twitter
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.360]  because it's been professionally, personally,
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.360]  intellectually, artistically, it's been an incredible thing
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.360]  over its lifetime for me.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:21.360]  And so I don't want to give up on Twitter as a thing.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:23.360]  So people are talking about deleting it
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.360]  and what's been good is over on Mastodon,
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.360]  if somebody says, oh, I'm deleting my Twitter,
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.360]  people are like, don't do it.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.360]  Just put a thing, tell people where to find you
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:33.360]  and leave it in amber, make it read only for yourself.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.360]  But if you delete it, then your hand will freeze up
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.360]  and your history is lost and you're not helping Elon
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  by keeping an active account that you're not using
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.360]  if that's your concern.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:45.360]  But you're helping yourself by making sure
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.360]  you're not giving up your identity
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:49.360]  and what you've said and all the rest of it.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.360]  Yeah, and as much as most of us
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.360]  have spent most of the last 16 years,
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.360]  more or less dicking or just screwing around on Twitter.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.360]  Exactly.
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.360]  Some of our tweets are worth referencing
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:02.360]  and it's good to keep.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:07.360]  Again, I keep saying I'm not passing judgment.
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:09.360]  I guess I am mildly.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:13.360]  I would prefer people to leave their Twitter accounts up
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.360]  and just stop using them, but I do.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:17.360]  I'm not mad at you if you deleted your account
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:18.360]  because I get it.
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  But I was going to make fun of you
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:23.360]  for how many tweets you posted.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.360]  I looked it up and the Glen F Twitter account finished
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:29.360]  or if it is finished, at least on hiatus,
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:33.360]  with 117,447 tweets.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.360]  No, sorry, John, there's a missing piece,
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.360]  which is I deleted all my tweets from before 2018.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.360]  Oh, then no wonder it makes sense.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  Yeah, there's like a half a million going.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:44.360]  And the reason was people were, yeah,
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:45.360]  so I'm honest about that.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  I've posted times.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  I first did below it before 2018 and later before 2019
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.360]  because I used to use Twitter more like IRC,
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:54.360]  especially in the early days.
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  And then there was that, you remember,
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  there's an extended point where anything you said
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:01.360]  was being used, was being harvested by,
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.360]  and especially with Gamergate and other stuff,
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  there's a point where I'm like,
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.360]  I am just going to get rid of it
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  otherwise I have to go through a half a million tweets
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:09.360]  and figure out if there's something
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:11.360]  that can be misconstrued or, you know,
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.360]  this is what happened to, not to defend,
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.360]  I don't want to reopen Bean Dad gate,
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:17.360]  but that's what happened to John Roderick.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.360]  It's not that John Roderick was starving his child.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.360]  He was telling a funny story and people went,
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:24.360]  oh, this guy's a terrible father.
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  Let's make him the main character of the day
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.360]  and went insane and it was, you know,
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.360]  he's a storyteller, A, but B,
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.360]  people went back to find old bad tweets
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  and what they found was he said things sarcastically
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.360]  that out of context sounded like he was horrible
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.360]  and he's not a horrible person.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:41.360]  You know, I mean, we all know people in comedies
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.360]  and Seattleite, he said things that maybe were too,
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:47.360]  in a particular way if you read them,
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  sounded more negative than they were,
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.360]  but they're absolutely in keeping
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  with this sort of sarcastic tone.
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.360]  So if you read them in sequence, you'd be like,
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:55.360]  oh, this is a joke, I get it, that's funny,
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.360]  he's making fun of those people.
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  So at some point I'm like,
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  I do not need to spend the rest of my life
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.360]  dealing with things that I said in an unguarded fashion,
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:05.360]  so I'm just gonna delete them all.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.360]  So I probably had, like I said,
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.360]  at least half a million tweets on that number,
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.360]  so there you go.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  That, thank God.
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  Because I looked it up, my account,
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:17.360]  and I've never done a mass deletion,
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.360]  I'm at 85,048 tweets and I was like,
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.360]  wait, I'm in the ballpark of Glenn,
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:22.360]  why am I making fun of him?
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.360]  That's not possible.
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  Yeah, all right.
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:25.360]  No, I did a fundraiser for Planned Parenthood
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.360]  when I hit 500,000 and raised a few thousand dollars
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.360]  from somebody and I let someone,
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.360]  I was like, you can be my 500,000th tweet,
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  tell me what to tell, it's a tweet,
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  and then I think they didn't or something,
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  but they still donated the money,
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  so there was a point when I hit that number.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.360]  I've been, I signed up for Mastodon in 2018,
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.360]  I've been talking about it
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:45.360]  the last few episodes of the show,
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.360]  but the more I'm using it,
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.360]  the more happy I am with it
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:51.360]  and the more I'm like,
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:54.360]  my skepticism is fading away,
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.360]  all for the better.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  The ivory beta, right?
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:00.360]  I do have the ivory beta from Tapbots, which is-
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.360]  Yeah, Tapbots, I mean, I just got in recently
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:05.360]  and I've been using different Mastodon clients
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.360]  like Mammoth and the Mastodon, the branded one,
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.360]  and the website interface and all that,
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:13.360]  and I got ivory and I was like, oh, yeah.
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.360]  I mean, none of those are terrible.
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  They weren't really meant for this kind of volume
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.360]  and there's all kinds of things that,
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  Mastodon is evolving super rapidly,
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:21.360]  it's open source,
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.360]  there's people working on checking in
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.360]  a bazillion new features and ideas
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.360]  and improving things,
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.360]  so it's gonna evolve super fast,
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.360]  but these apps evolve less rapidly than the code base.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:34.360]  So, that said, I started using ivory and I'm like,
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:37.360]  oh, yeah, this is the warm hot tub
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:40.360]  that I've been looking for instead of the ice cold bath.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.360]  I do not mean to, and I get it,
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.360]  I don't know if they've filled up
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:48.360]  the entire 10,000 test flight capability yet,
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:51.360]  but I know that when Tapbots opened it up,
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.360]  I think it was a couple days before Christmas,
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:55.360]  they opened up like another thousand slots
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:57.360]  and they said when they were gonna do it
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:59.360]  and I think the thousand slots
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.360]  seriously went in like 15 seconds.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.360]  Yeah, I think they have multiple,
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.360]  I don't know if they give permission,
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:07.360]  I think they have multiple 10,000 slot things,
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:08.360]  they're doing something,
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:11.360]  and I think it was 10,014,
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.360]  no, that must not be right,
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.360]  it must be a thousand,
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:17.360]  but it's a 0.1 alpha, folks, it's not,
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.360]  Well, they're doing it,
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.360]  but they're rapidly progressing towards something
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.360]  that I think that they can ship as a 1.0.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:26.360]  I think it's surprisingly close.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:29.360]  And I think, you know,
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:31.360]  maybe I'll have the Tapbot guys on,
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.360]  it would actually be enjoyable for me
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:34.360]  to talk about this with them,
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.360]  but I think though that years ago
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:41.360]  they abstracted out the Twitter specificness
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.360]  of Tweetbot.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.360]  That's right.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.360]  In the app, remember app.net?
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.360]  It was ahead of,
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:47.360]  I loved app.net, yeah.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.360]  I did too, and it was ahead of its time,
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.360]  but in anticipation of app.net
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:54.360]  possibly becoming a thing,
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.360]  Tweetbot's architecture was sort of
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.360]  abstracted away from being,
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:02.360]  assuming that it was Twitter specific,
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:05.360]  and that obviously was to their benefit
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.360]  to prepare for making a Mastodon client.
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.360]  They can't,
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.360]  my understanding of the Twitter PI rules
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:17.360]  is that any third party Twitter client,
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.360]  and everybody knows from years ago
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.360]  that Twitter has gotten,
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:22.360]  as of 2018,
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:25.360]  kind of funny about third party clients.
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.360]  I'm still not, even with Elon Musk,
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:30.360]  I'm not entirely convinced that they're gonna,
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:31.360]  I wouldn't be surprised if by the time
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:33.360]  this episode airs if, you know,
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.360]  somebody kicks the plug out of the wall
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:37.360]  on the API server, right?
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.360]  But they can't,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.360]  the rules of the Twitter API
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.360]  for third party clients is that
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.360]  you're not allowed to integrate
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:47.360]  with other competing services.
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.360]  So a Tweetbot or Twitterific
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:53.360]  can't build in Mastodon support
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:55.360]  in the same app because that's a,
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.360]  so they have to make a separate app.
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:01.360]  As opposed to the actual
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:04.360]  Fediverse of Mastodon and anything else
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:06.360]  that uses these open protocols, right,
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  which, you know, Mastodon is
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.360]  truly in the spirit of the open web,
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.360]  and if there's, or like
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:14.360]  Matt and Reese's Microdot blog,
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.360]  which is not Mastodon,
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.360]  but which uses and talks to the same APIs.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.360]  So Microdot blog, if you're logged in,
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.360]  you can follow people on a Mastodon site
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:26.360]  and get them into your Microdot blog feed.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.360]  I saw a chart the other day,
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.360]  someone's like, look,
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:30.360]  if you want to know what the Fediverse is,
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.360]  and the reason some of us keep harping on about it is,
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:34.360]  you know, the Fediverse is not Mastodon,
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.360]  but by that we don't just mean that
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.360]  there's something like Mastodon's too limiting
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.360]  or it's a name of a project.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  They said, here's what it really looks like,
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:43.360]  and they posted one of those things
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:45.360]  that are usually horrifying because they're like,
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  here's what the ad services universe looks like
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.360]  and there's 4700 companies occupying niches.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.360]  Instead, this was like 50 projects,
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.360]  and they're all open source,
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.360]  and some may have commercial aspect,
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:00.360]  but they're all basically people
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.360]  trying to make this thing happen in different ways.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:03.360]  And so, you know, Matt and Reese's,
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.360]  microblog.org is in there, and microblog,
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  I'm sorry, I just said this thing wrong.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.360]  Anyway, Matt and Reese's thing is in there,
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:10.360]  and Mastodon, but then there were like,
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360]  again, like 48 other things,
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360]  not all of which were about microblogging.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.360]  Some were different aspects of services interaction
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:18.360]  and how they all kind of fit,
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:21.360]  and I was like, oh, this is gonna be exciting
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:23.360]  because we haven't even scratched the surface
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:26.360]  of a mass usage in any one of those areas.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.360]  So this could actually cause a blossoming
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  of all of these related,
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:32.360]  fetaverse things that we haven't even, you know,
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:33.360]  haven't even risen to consciousness
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  because we're not switching over
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:37.360]  from a failing or faltering,
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:38.360]  whatever you wanna call it,
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.360]  you know, major social network.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:41.360]  They have all different purposes.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.360]  Yeah, the note that I jotted to myself
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:45.360]  a day or two ago in anticipation
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:48.360]  of talking to you about it is that what's occurred to me,
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:52.360]  the more I'm using Ivory and Mastodon
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:55.360]  and less using Tweetbot and Twitter
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:59.360]  is that Mastodon just has the feeling
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:01.360]  of being a frontier,
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:07.360]  and I'm suddenly recalling now deep in middle age
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  how comfortable I am on the frontier
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:13.360]  of new things like this, right?
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.360]  You know, and going all the way back
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.360]  to getting on the internet at the very beginning
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:23.360]  in the days when Usenet was the thing,
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.360]  you know, the whole thing seemed so new
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.360]  that it didn't even occur to me
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  to think of it as a frontier
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  because it was so obviously a frontier,
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.360]  and BBSs, right, which weren't really connected
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:39.360]  to the internet, but it all felt new and exciting
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:42.360]  and things were happening where it's like,
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:46.360]  oh, man, all of a sudden a 14.4 modem
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:48.360]  is actually something I can afford,
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  and now I can download binaries
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:53.360]  at a reasonable speed from the BBS,
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:56.360]  and it doesn't take, you know, four hours
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  to just download an app or a game
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:10:59.360]  or something that somebody shared,
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:02.360]  and just the, I don't know,
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.360]  it's exciting and fun to be somewhere
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.360]  where it's fluid and new and changing
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  and evolving rapidly, and so far,
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:21.360]  everybody is just, it's just a good community spirit.
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  Yeah, it's not, I mean, it's resistant
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:28.360]  to a certain kind of jerk or troll.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  It's not immune to it, obviously,
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:32.360]  because of the instant base distribution
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.360]  and because moderators, because they're not beholden
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.360]  to shareholders or other interests,
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.360]  they're sort of beholden to the users
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.360]  that they host or to nobody.
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.360]  They can make these independent decisions,
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.360]  and that's the fear of balkanization
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360]  is moderation is a hard problem.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360]  It's very hard at scale.
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:51.360]  It's very easy to piss people off,
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:53.360]  and it's also extremely easy to take positions
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.360]  that are at odds with, you know,
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.360]  some or most of the people on the instance you're running,
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.360]  so that's, I know that's a big fear.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:01.360]  If you read, you know, you read Tech Dirt,
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:03.360]  like I do, I'm sure, and Mike Masnick,
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.360]  just, I mean, he and his colleagues there
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:07.360]  write tremendously good things
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  about why moderation at scale is difficult
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.360]  and their fears about that relative to Mastodon
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  plus some liability issues.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:17.360]  EFF has written a great roundup of, I think it's EFF,
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:20.360]  about if you're a Mastodon, I was saying EFF,
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  anyway, there's a good article floating around now,
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:25.360]  I'm being erratic, about if you're a Mastodon host,
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.360]  what it means for you in terms of making sure
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.360]  you comply with the MCA, if you run an instance, that is,
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.360]  and have other people on it,
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  like how you comply with the MCA rules,
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.360]  and which are relatively easy to comply with,
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:38.360]  but if you don't, you could wind up in a pickle
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:41.360]  if somebody, you know, wanted to post something
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:44.360]  that could be problematic and someone can't reach you
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.360]  and so forth, so there are some risks,
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:49.360]  but I think, you know, this is, you've seen this,
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.360]  I'm sure, the last week or so,
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:54.360]  there's been a quote tweet turmoil raging on Mastodon
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:57.360]  because Mastodon does not offer a quote tweet function,
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:00.360]  a quote toot function or whatever we're gonna call it.
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.360]  This was my next topic, my final thing to ask you about,
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.360]  so explain to people who aren't sure what the controversy is.
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:10.360]  So on Twitter, when Twitter introduced quote tweeting,
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:13.360]  before quote tweet existed as a thing on Twitter,
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.360]  people did it vernacularly, you would copy a URL
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  and you'd say, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, my opinion,
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:21.360]  and paste it in, or you just paste in the URL sometimes.
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.360]  I mean, they had a, sorry,
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:24.360]  there was a retweet feature for a long time,
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.360]  so retweet, you just select it,
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  but if you wanted to comment on or add an image
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.360]  or do anything, you would just make a new message
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.360]  and paste in the Twitter URL,
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:33.360]  and depending on your client or whatever,
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:35.360]  it would show the previous URL in line.
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:38.360]  Then Twitter created that as an actual feature
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.360]  so you could quote tweet
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  and it would sort of structurally support it,
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:44.360]  but it was designed in such a way that even people who,
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:47.360]  like you couldn't quote tweet restricted accounts,
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.360]  but there were other ways in which,
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  like if you were blocked from seeing somebody,
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:53.360]  you could see there a quoted tweet version of it
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.360]  and there were abuse vectors and so forth.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.360]  There's a huge debate raging is,
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:59.360]  so Mastodon has not been designed
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:00.360]  with a quote tweet feature,
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.360]  and that's partly because, you know,
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  each Mastodon message is essentially hosted
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.360]  on the instance on which you're located.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.360]  There's like 4,000 Mastodon instances now,
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.360]  at least, or last time I checked.
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:15.360]  So, you know, when you're retweeting something,
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:16.360]  it's all centralized.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:19.360]  When you're re-boosting something
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.360]  or whatever you would call it in the Mastodon world,
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  it's a question of how that gets drawn in and structured.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.360]  So there's apparently some code in the Mastodon project
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.360]  that would enable a form of re-boosting
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.360]  and it's not rolled out.
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.360]  And there's a structural issue,
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  which is that some people maintain that retweeting
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  is a very, or sort of quote tweeting,
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360]  I should say specifically,
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:42.360]  is an easy way to brigade people and people who are,
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:44.360]  and so it's not like it's exclusively
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.360]  by any means used for that purpose,
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:48.360]  but people feel like it's a very easy way
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.360]  to point a lot of people at somebody who said something
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:53.360]  and create main characters of the day.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.360]  Like the main, you know, Ryan Broderick of Garbage Day,
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  I love his stuff.
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:00.360]  He's got a podcast, Content Minds.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.360]  And when he talks about Twitter,
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:03.360]  the main character of the day
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.360]  or the internet's main character, whatever,
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:08.360]  that is a flaw of Twitter, not a feature, right?
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  We shouldn't have a bean dab.
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:11.360]  We shouldn't have a has she landed,
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.360]  has Justine landed yet?
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:14.360]  Like all these things typically target people
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.360]  with the wrong kind of attention.
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.360]  It's rarely solitary.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:20.360]  It's almost always an exaggerated character, whatever.
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  So Mastodon is not designed with that feature.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.360]  Yet, it's possible to add it.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:25.360]  It could be added.
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:28.360]  And the raging debate is whether Mastodon
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.360]  is failing as a service,
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  even though it's just getting all this usage
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.360]  just a few years old
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:35.360]  because it isn't offering quote tweeting
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  and whether there's a backlash
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.360]  where people are like, we never want to add it,
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.360]  or it has to be in such a way
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.360]  that an instance could turn it off
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.360]  so that somebody at another instance
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.360]  couldn't quote tweet someone an instance
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.360]  that had it disabled
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.360]  or it should be disabled on a message-by-message basis.
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.360]  So I think this is,
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:54.360]  the great part is this is vibrant,
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.360]  excellent discussion about abuse vectors
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.360]  and whether this could cause problems.
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:15:59.360]  And the downside is like,
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.360]  oh God, we have our first conversation
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:03.360]  that takes over the whole timeline.
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:05.360]  So I've been muting people selectively
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  for like three days, right?
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.360]  This is built in muting and features.
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.360]  Mastodon is designed with muting
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.360]  and blocking features that are really good.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:14.360]  And I'm like, if people are going on about quote tweeting,
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.360]  I'm like, I'm going to mute them for three days
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:17.360]  and see if the fever passes
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.360]  because I don't care about it enough
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.360]  that I want every other message in my timeline
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:23.360]  to be talking about quote tweet.
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.360]  So at some level Mastodon has succeeded
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:28.360]  in becoming a mass medium
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.360]  because everyone is talking about the same thing.
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:34.360]  Yeah, I'm of the opinion
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:36.360]  that don't think quote tweeting
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:40.360]  is inherently problematic as a vector
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:42.360]  for, as you said, brigading.
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:47.360]  But I appreciate the fact
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.360]  that the Mastodon at a community level
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.360]  is being, the community is evolving
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:59.360]  from a conservative viewpoint on those issues.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:02.360]  So I think that quote tweeting
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.360]  should be a Mastodon feature.
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:05.360]  I think it's too useful.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:08.360]  I think the idea that it's inherently problematic
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.360]  in terms of the way it can lead to pile-ons
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:14.360]  and dunking is overstayed.
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:17.360]  But I appreciate that they're going
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:20.360]  from a let's be careful viewpoint going forward.
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:23.360]  And the reason though I think it's futile
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  to not have it is,
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:29.360]  it's that line from Jurassic Park,
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.360]  that life will find a way,
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:34.360]  like with the idea that,
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.360]  oh, we're only going to have female dinosaurs
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:39.360]  so therefore there will be no breeding out in the wild
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.360]  and life finds a way, something's going to happen.
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.360]  And people find a way, right?
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:47.360]  And it's the way that Twitter itself evolved
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.360]  where even mentions,
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:55.360]  at username mentions were an idiom
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:57.360]  that the users on Twitter came up with
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:00.360]  that did nothing in the APIs.
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:02.360]  They weren't even hot links originally.
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:06.360]  It just became a convention that Twitter users had
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:09.360]  where I would say at Glen F
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.360]  and say something in response to a tweet of yours
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.360]  and then the third-party clients would pick up
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:19.360]  on those things through a search just for the string.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:21.360]  It wasn't a magical feature.
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.360]  And retweeting started like that,
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:25.360]  all sorts of, almost everything on Twitter.
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.360]  Hashtag.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:30.360]  Yeah, hashtags is probably the,
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.360]  maybe the best example
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.360]  where it wasn't a built-in feature of Twitter at all.
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:38.360]  It was just, well, here's something that you can do
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.360]  because it's just text in a tweet.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:42.360]  Just use the pound sign
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:45.360]  and put a unique string of characters
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:47.360]  that is human readable after it
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:49.360]  and then third-party clients could do it.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:52.360]  So without quote tweeting,
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:55.360]  Mastodon clients would evolve to do it anyway.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.360]  And I even saw in the discussion people are having
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.360]  where there's clients that are talking about doing things
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.360]  and I think there's already people
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.360]  outside of the actual client software
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:08.360]  who've ginned up their own solutions with scripting
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:11.360]  or shortcuts where you take a screenshot
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:14.360]  of the tweet you want to quote tweet
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:17.360]  and a link to the,
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.360]  or not tweet but to whatever they call them, right?
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:22.360]  A Mastodon post.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:23.360]  Take a screenshot of it,
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.360]  get the URL that points to the original
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:29.360]  and then pre-populate a new post from your account
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.360]  with the URL to the original
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:33.360]  and a screenshot of the original
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.360]  and then you can do your quote tweeting
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  and it's effectively a quote.
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.360]  People are going to find a way to quote tweet
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  whether it's a built-in function or not
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.360]  but if they make it a built-in function
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  then they can do things like what you mentioned
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.360]  where you could say,
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:52.360]  I would like to make this tweet unquote tweetable
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.360]  because I don't want to hear from people about it.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:56.360]  I realize that what I'm about to say
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:58.360]  people might think is controversial
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:00.360]  because whatever the issue is,
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:03.360]  or you just don't want to be bothered with it.
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:06.360]  You could just say make this one unquote tweetable
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:09.360]  but as long as quote tweeting is a built-in feature
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.360]  then there's not going to be any demand
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:14.360]  to build those workaround features to get around it.
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:15.360]  I totally agree.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:17.360]  And you saw Twitter even evolve where they were like
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.360]  you could set who can reply to this tweet
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:22.360]  which I thought was a great feature and underutilized.
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:25.360]  So, I mean, I love the idea that there's,
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:27.360]  that Mastodon is coming at it,
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:28.360]  I think structurally they're coming at it
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:31.360]  from a position of having learned from Gamergate
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:32.360]  and learned from Twitter
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:34.360]  and learned from mass abuse attacks.
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:38.360]  So the system as a whole seems to be designed
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:40.360]  for least harm as its starting point.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:41.360]  And so anything that's added
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.360]  has to be fit within that framework.
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:44.360]  And so if, you know,
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:46.360]  maybe there's going to be six months of conversation
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360]  about quote boosting or whatever
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:51.360]  or maybe there'll be three weeks of it
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.360]  but when it rolls out, I'm much more confident with it
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:55.360]  that it'll be a consensus driven thing
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360]  that has more options.
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:00.360]  So like even when you post a message in Mastodon,
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:02.360]  there's the quote, the content warning link
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.360]  which some people just treat like a subject line
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:05.360]  which is also fine.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  Some people ignore.
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.360]  There's a lot of debates about how that gets used.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.360]  You know, should it be used to warn about racism
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:12.360]  or is racism something we should talk about
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:13.360]  openly without content warnings?
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.360]  You know, that's an interesting debate.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:16.360]  It's a good one to have.
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:17.360]  It's a good one to expose.
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:20.360]  There's the sort of four levels of post visibility.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.360]  You can post something that doesn't get indexed
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:24.360]  or isn't listed.
[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:26.360]  And there's like a lot of really,
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.360]  or even you add an image and it presents you
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:31.360]  with this ability to even in the native,
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.360]  you know, the website based client, the web app,
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.360]  you can click and extract text through OCR
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  from the image you've uploaded.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.360]  So if you're posting a screenshot
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:41.360]  and I've been trying to really obsessively
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:45.360]  put at least some text into every image I post
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.360]  because it's a cultural norm among
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:49.360]  the early Mastodon adopters
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:51.360]  but I also think I like to do anything
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:54.360]  in which accessibility is incorporated by design.
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:55.360]  I wanna support and uphold it
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.360]  and it also, I think it makes you,
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.360]  I think it makes things better for everyone
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:01.360]  if you use accessibility features.
[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:04.360]  So yeah, I mean, I think the community as it stands,
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:06.360]  even with millions of people onboarding
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:09.360]  has still vibrant but not seemingly horrible
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:11.360]  debates about the direction of it
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:13.360]  but the direction will be set by people involved
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.360]  in an open source project that is, you know,
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.360]  it's got aspects of, you know,
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.360]  some people making decisions
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:21.360]  but also a lot of consensus driven thing
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:23.360]  and what's not underlying it is a,
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:24.360]  we have to increase engagement.
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.360]  We need more people posting every day.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:27.360]  We need to squeeze more ads in.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.360]  I don't think we've had anything like that
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:32.360]  maybe ever that's really been driven
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.360]  and entirely by community needs,
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:35.360]  except maybe Usenet.
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:36.360]  I mean, that's the last thing
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:37.360]  that's really like this, isn't it?
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:38.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.360]  And I, you know, I was just reading
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:42.360]  how Usenet is still a thing and, you know,
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:46.360]  in fact, it's growing in some ways.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:47.360]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:50.360]  It's just Mastodon is so clearly
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:52.360]  of the spirit of the open web
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:55.360]  and it thrilling to me to see it take off
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:59.360]  and I'm happy to say that my skepticism,
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:01.360]  my initial skepticism that it was gonna be able
[02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:05.360]  to work or scale, you know, is wrong.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:07.360]  I've never, it's one of those things
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.360]  where I'm happy to be wrong about.
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  I hope it stays that way.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:12.360]  I kind of feel, and this is one of those things
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.360]  that I hope doesn't sound elitist,
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.360]  but I kind of feel is fundamentally true
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:22.360]  that maybe having a slightly higher bar
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:25.360]  to sign up and get started compared to Twitter
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:29.360]  is for the better for those of us
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.360]  who are happy to step over that bar
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:37.360]  that one service for 300 million people
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:40.360]  like Twitter is two, you know,
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:42.360]  it's actually not good to be on a platform
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.360]  of 300 million other people.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.360]  Well, someone could start an unfederated Mastodon
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:48.360]  that was instanced that was, or not unfederated,
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:50.360]  but it could be loosely federated.
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:52.360]  Someone could have a, you know, not OnlyFans,
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:53.360]  that's the porn thing, I'm sorry.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.360]  There's celebrity things, right?
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.360]  There's some celebrity services,
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:59.360]  but they could, what's the one where you call
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:02.360]  and people, you can get a custom message,
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:03.360]  a custom video from somebody.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:04.360]  Oh, what is that?
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:07.360]  That's a different kind of custom video.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.360]  It's something, ah, I forgot,
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.360]  but that kind of thing, you know,
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.360]  someone could set up a Mastodon instance
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:14.360]  that's meant for a lot of people
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:17.360]  as very easy onboarding and it's designed
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:20.360]  to be a distributor of news and celebrity information
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.360]  and the celebrities all go there to post stuff
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.360]  because it's safe and maybe it's federated
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  but it's federated unidirectionally
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:27.360]  so celebrities' tweets go out
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.360]  but people who are members of it
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:30.360]  aren't federated out for the rest.
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:32.360]  So you could have 10 million people
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:35.360]  on a server someplace doing mostly read only
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.360]  which is what most Twitter usage,
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.360]  I mean, if 300 million users on Twitter,
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  you know, you've seen those big head long tail curves,
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:45.360]  a tiny fraction posts more than like a message a year
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:48.360]  and most people use Twitter in a way
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  that you and I have no, you know,
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:53.360]  most people, it's a reading mechanism,
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:55.360]  it's a reading medium with very little conversation
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  and Mastodon is very much a conversation medium
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  and the early people are very much talking
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.360]  so that could evolve too for sure.
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:04.360]  Cameo is what you're thinking.
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:06.360]  Cameo, thank you, yeah.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  I was very, I have not paid for cameos from anybody
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:12.360]  but when Rudy Giuliani was on,
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:17.360]  I was very tempted to get some Rudy messages
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:18.360]  to a bunch of my friends.
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:19.360]  You don't wanna get a Danny DeVito message
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:20.360]  for your birthday, are you sure?
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.360]  No, I wanna send other people Rudy Giuliani.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.360]  Oh, that's interesting.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  But anyway, that's about it for me.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.360]  Tell me about Shift Happens
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  and you got this in the show notes,
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:31.360]  so tell me about this.
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:33.360]  Oh, I just, my God, this is a book,
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:37.360]  Marching Wishery is the author of this tome,
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  this 1200 page, two volume book set
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.360]  with a third extra volume
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:44.360]  that he started working on in 2016.
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.360]  It's about the history of keyboards
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:49.360]  from typewriters to like the present day.
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  Boring, I have no interest whatsoever.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.360]  Keep me away from this, duh.
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:56.360]  Nobody listings a show
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  has any interest in keyboards or typewriters,
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:00.360]  absolutely aware of it
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.360]  and yeah, it's gonna be catnip for a lot of people
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:05.360]  but so Marching started on this in 2016
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:08.360]  with the outgrowth of some essays he's writing at Medium
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:11.360]  and then he wandered in by accident.
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:14.360]  He was on the wrong day in the wrong place
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:15.360]  and he wandered into a museum
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:17.360]  that should have been closed in Spain
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:20.360]  and then did not speak the language.
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:21.360]  People there were speaking Catalan.
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.360]  He doesn't speak Spanish or Catalan
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360]  and he finally got pushed upstairs
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:27.360]  and it was the most glorious collection of typewriters
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.360]  in the world just about
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:31.360]  and this led him on this journey to write this book
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  and so a couple of years after that,
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  I'd met him on Twitter
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:36.360]  and I'm like, hey, you got an editor for this book
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:37.360]  because I'm literally looking.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  This sounds great, whatever.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  So for five years plus,
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:42.360]  I've been involved with him
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.360]  on this editing and development journey
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  and he's been at it for seven
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  and it's gonna be great.
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360]  We're gonna go to Kickstarter in February
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:53.360]  and he's got a site up at shifthappens.site.
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:56.360]  Just launched literally today while recording this.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:57.360]  We're just getting it finished
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:58.360]  and John, let me tell you,
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:26:59.360]  getting a book printed,
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:00.360]  like this is a Kickstarter project
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:02.360]  and then we'll do pre-orders after
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:03.360]  if we reach the goal
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  and it'll ship in like August, September of this year.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  Like the book is pretty close
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:09.360]  and we kind of need to go over the top
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:12.360]  but it started at like almost 400,000 words.
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:14.360]  We got it down to under 300,000.
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.360]  There are so many great stories in this thing
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  but we're like, all right.
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  So a year ago, we've been getting printing bids.
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:21.360]  We're sort of going onto it
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:23.360]  and then everything went out of control, right?
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:24.360]  Everyone's experienced this
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.360]  but like shipping containers from China
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:29.360]  went up to like $25,000 up from like 5,000
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.360]  and paper price is good with the wolf
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:32.360]  and inflation is whatever.
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:35.360]  This is before Russia invades Ukraine, right?
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.360]  And we're like, God, you're gonna have to delay this a year
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.360]  because the supply chain is so crazy.
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:41.360]  I'm not sure if we raise the money
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:43.360]  in February or March, 2022,
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:45.360]  if we could ship it in the same calendar year
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.360]  and from both holiday sales issues and tax reasons,
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:50.360]  you kind of want your revenue
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.360]  and your expense to be in the same calendar year
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  if you're a cash-based business,
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:55.360]  which most businesses are.
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:58.360]  Anyhow, so that's when Ukraine invades
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:00.360]  or Ukraine has invaded and so forth.
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:01.360]  But at one point in this last year,
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  a few months ago, we're like,
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:04.360]  okay, so if we order the paper
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:06.360]  from this factory in Gem�ntse, Germany
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:11.360]  on Lake Gem�ntse, then we'll get it shipped over land
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.360]  into a container and then have it loaded on boats
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:21.360]  and shipped to Maine where we were really gonna order
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:24.360]  like tens of thousands of pounds of paper from Germany
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:26.360]  and have it shipped over the Atlantic at one point.
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.360]  And fortunately, we were able to find
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:30.360]  a very good domestic US paper
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.360]  that was close enough, but holy cow,
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:35.360]  it has been a hilarious logistics part.
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:37.360]  So we finally have like a printer,
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.360]  we have a paper, we have a bid that works,
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:44.360]  we've just got a press test with images printed
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  to test profiles, and they're using stochastic screening,
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:49.360]  which is the new hotness.
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.360]  Everyone does this now.
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:54.360]  Halftone screening is a thing of the past, Jon.
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:55.360]  Does it make you feel old?
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:56.360]  Yes.
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:59.360]  Stochastic screening is so amazing.
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:00.360]  I mean, it's been in use for years,
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:01.360]  but it's gotten better and better.
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:03.360]  And we got some samples a year ago.
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.360]  This one press up in Canada was like,
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:08.360]  first, they said, oh, we print such and such.
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:09.360]  I'm like, oh, I have a bunch of those
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:10.360]  because I like that.
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:11.360]  And second, they sent us samples
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:14.360]  and I'm looking under a loop at like 10X magnification
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:16.360]  and I'm like, this cannot be.
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.360]  They're printing green, but this is CMYK.
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:21.360]  Why does it look so good in the alignment?
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:23.360]  The registration is so perfect.
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  So with stochastic screening, it's like dithering.
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  It's like really good algorithmic dithering,
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.360]  but at a level where you're like
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.360]  at thousandths of an inch dots.
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  It's like the finest, almost finest laser writer
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.360]  or laser output dots, right?
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.360]  So when you have fine type,
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.360]  like you have the letters in a shop window
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:45.360]  or letters on a, someone's typing a letter
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:46.360]  and you have a picture of a typewriter,
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.360]  you can zoom, and this is halftone,
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:52.360]  you can zoom in and you can actually read the words
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:54.360]  on the typewrited letter in like an image
[02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:56.360]  that's like three by three inches
[02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:58.360]  and the typewriter is a fraction of that.
[02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:00.360]  So the screening is, this is not limited
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:02.360]  to the printer we're using,
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:05.360]  but it is like a digital revolution
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.360]  in the sense of like when we went from, you know,
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:10.360]  wax and knives to desktop publishing
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.360]  and early desktop publishing was sort of crummy,
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:14.360]  but it was fine, it was good.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.360]  It was good enough.
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.360]  Stochastic screening is such a leap for me as someone.
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.360]  I co-wrote some of the editions
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:22.360]  of real-world scanning and halftones,
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:24.360]  as you may recall, and read a little bit
[02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:26.360]  about stochastic screening in the second
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:28.360]  and third editions and I'm like, oh my God,
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:31.360]  it's like you're not like, oh, are we gonna get a moir�
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:34.360]  and oh, are they using open rosettes at a 90 degree?
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:36.360]  And you're like, you just send the images
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.360]  with the profile to the printer
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:41.360]  and we got them back in printed form off the press.
[02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:44.360]  They did one signature, so 16 pages aside
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:45.360]  and folded it for us to look at
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.360]  and we're gonna use these as,
[02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:49.360]  we'll be sending some of these out to people
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:50.360]  and you look at it and you're like,
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:52.360]  this looks as good as it looks on screen
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:54.360]  because you're not dealing, the halftone dots,
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.360]  it's not that they're super fine, they just don't exist.
[02:30:57.360 --> 02:30:59.360]  Anyway, it's one of the most,
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:01.360]  I'm excited about it with this book.
[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.360]  It's not like a, it's not super new,
[02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:05.360]  so people who've been getting stuff printed listing this
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:07.360]  will be like, Glenn has lost his mind,
[02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:09.360]  I was using stochastic screening 10 years ago
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.360]  and it was great then,
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:12.360]  but it's exciting to be involved with the project.
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:13.360]  Well, I think every time you're on the show,
[02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:15.360]  some of the people think you lost your mind, Glenn.
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.360]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:19.360]  Well, you know that I'm gonna order the Glenn thing
[02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:22.360]  and you know, I'll be up for a Kickstarter link
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:24.360]  come February, but in the meantime,
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:28.360]  people can go to Shift, Shift, don't forget the F.
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:29.360]  That's right, there's an F in there.
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:32.360]  Shifthappens.site and get the preview.
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:35.360]  There's a great, oh, sorry.
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:37.360]  Well, I just suspect that there's a lot of people listening
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:38.360]  who are gonna be intrigued.
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360]  I think, yeah, I think there's a,
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:42.360]  we think we know our audience and it doesn't,
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:44.360]  the book doesn't pander, but at the last minute,
[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:47.360]  just a few weeks ago, I get an email from Arshin
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:50.360]  and he's like, I just discovered a Nobel prize winning
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:53.360]  physicist got obsessed about using lasers
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:56.360]  to erase typos off typewriters and I'm like, what?
[02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:59.360]  And so he had to rewrite a chapter about,
[02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:02.360]  it's just, the story is insane, but the great part is,
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:05.360]  he's like, I wanna get a picture of this thing
[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:06.360]  and we're like, well, can we get the picture?
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:07.360]  Like, well, what if we contact,
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.360]  so he was able to go to the institution
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:13.360]  that had the documents, get original materials.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.360]  So he's doing, you know, real research,
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:16.360]  but in another case, there was some photo
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:19.360]  he was trying to get and I'm like, well, that guy's dead,
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:21.360]  but you know, maybe this person who knew him
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:23.360]  is the estate, is the, what do you call it,
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:25.360]  the executor of his estate.
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:27.360]  So Arshin's like, he emails that guy
[02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:29.360]  and that person puts him in touch with the fellow's daughter
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:32.360]  and gets permission to use this wonderful photo in the book
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:34.360]  that we otherwise wouldn't have been able to use,
[02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:36.360]  but it's that kind of process where like, you're just,
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.360]  he's gonna have some stuff in there
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:39.360]  that's never been seen before,
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.360]  but there's also these just, these stories
[02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:43.360]  where you're like, this couldn't have happened.
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:46.360]  Like, no, this is a real thing related to typewriters
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:48.360]  or a keyboard and it's a hoot.
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:49.360]  Well, I look forward to it.
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.360]  I thank you for your time.
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.360]  Thank you.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:53.360]  I hope you have a good rest of the holiday week.
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:55.360]  Thank you, have a happy new year.
