[00:00.000 --> 00:07.100]  You'd be the Cubs are in the World Series again every goddamn year. I know isn't it? It's annoying the same shit every year
[00:08.560 --> 00:10.560]  it's getting you know as a
[00:11.600 --> 00:13.600]  sort of Mariners fan
[00:13.760 --> 00:15.760]  It's getting pretty embarrassing
[00:22.080 --> 00:25.680]  Huh, well, okay pretty soon it's just gonna be us
[00:25.680 --> 00:30.680]  It is this is why I don't like baseball anymore
[00:32.320 --> 00:35.520]  And what's with Cleveland Cleveland can't stop winning no fair
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.920]  We win all the championships terrible, yeah
[00:41.280 --> 00:43.280]  It's rigged
[00:43.560 --> 00:46.400]  Just like the election just like the election
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.880]  Thing is right. Yep. The system is flawed. How are you John? I am fine. And how are you good?
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.480]  I'm a little chilly
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.800]  Yeah, yeah, it's like there. What's it like there these days 59 58 59 something. Yeah, that's about what it is here. Yeah
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.320]  Can't complain. Yeah
[01:05.680 --> 01:08.400]  I'm in the basement though. So it's cool. It's cooler down here
[01:09.080 --> 01:13.480]  I'm my office is chilly. It is I actually I've you know
[01:14.480 --> 01:20.440]  I'm a very delicate individual and I'm very sensitive to minor fluctuations in temperature, but I'm at the
[01:20.440 --> 01:27.000]  The north end of the house and so I get that my office gets
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.320]  Does not get the sunlight and I that makes the difference, you know
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.080]  Like what's what's temperate throughout the the main floor of the house is a little chilly in here. Yeah
[01:37.660 --> 01:42.540]  Well, I podcast in the basement and usually it's about the same all year round. I would say
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.320]  My office is up in the what is was the attic. It's a reef. It's a finished attic and
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.720]  It is it is boiling hot in the summer and freezing cold in the winter
[01:54.120 --> 02:01.880]  And there's like there's like three days on either, you know where those two meet where it's decent so kind of screwed
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.240]  It's a great place. You know, the boiling hot part is a particularly nice place to have a bunch of computer equipment
[02:09.280 --> 02:12.280]  That's very good it's good for the equipment really yeah
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.040]  Yeah, everything I know about computers is that it's very very good for them to be
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.480]  And and to be subject to you know, wild temperature changes
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.720]  Wire wires and things love that
[02:29.200 --> 02:31.800]  So I'm looking forward to Thursday, yeah, I
[02:32.480 --> 02:39.160]  Will be flying out tomorrow. We're recording on Tuesday show will air. I'll probably post it from an airplane tomorrow. I'm sure that'll work
[02:39.160 --> 02:59.160]  perfectly well, and then I will be there on Thursday, I'm excited I feel like I feel like this is a good one because we don't we don't know what the hell is going on really no, I mean not really I mean there's been there been some rumors about the
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.320]  The new MacBook Pro, right? That's the only thing I know about though
[03:03.680 --> 03:06.880]  Yeah, and I feel like everything else is sort of unknown, you know
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.040]  Like then there's rumors that there's going to be a new another new we'll get to all this in detail
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.520]  But there's rumors that there's going to be another in addition to the MacBook Pro a 13 inch
[03:16.120 --> 03:22.640]  MacBook of some sort whether this is an updated air whether it's a new 13 inch regular retina MacBook
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.080]  Which makes no sense to me?
[03:25.280 --> 03:26.960]  We don't know
[03:26.960 --> 03:28.960]  Yeah
[03:29.920 --> 03:31.560]  But I'm in the market
[03:31.560 --> 03:37.800]  Are you really? Yeah, cuz my MacBook Air is a 2012. Whoo. So that's that's good timing
[03:37.800 --> 03:40.340]  Yeah, so this is really exciting for you. Yeah
[03:40.340 --> 03:45.640]  I mean I was thinking that maybe I would get this year's MacBook when I came out in the spring, but I was like
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.960]  That wasn't quite a big enough update. It's a beautiful little machine. It's so nice
[03:52.960 --> 03:58.720]  It really is the most beautiful Mac that Apple's ever made every time I see it in the Apple Store and I just you know
[03:58.720 --> 04:01.680]  I told you I've told you but if you listen to the show
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.480]  but whoever the guests were in the last few weeks that we had a weird problem with Amy's Apple watch where
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.080]  the back came off and and we went right and I picked it up and
[04:10.880 --> 04:14.800]  So I've been in the Apple Store a lot recently and every time I walk by I always think god damn
[04:14.800 --> 04:17.180]  That's a nice little laptop. Yeah. Yeah
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.360]  and you
[04:20.360 --> 04:22.360]  What are your feelings on the keyboard? I?
[04:23.080 --> 04:25.080]  Could live with it. I'm
[04:25.080 --> 04:30.900]  I haven't spent significant time. Like I never got like a review unit of the regular MacBook
[04:30.900 --> 04:35.040]  So I've never spent like a significant amount of time on it, but I'm sure that I could get used to it
[04:35.080 --> 04:36.920]  Anything that has actual physical keys
[04:36.920 --> 04:42.280]  I'm sure I could get used to I think in the hypothetical future where they go to some kind of
[04:42.640 --> 04:48.600]  Touchscreen like surface for the keyboard to make it even thinner. I might have a serious problem then but yeah
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.120]  I would have a problem with that too up until that point
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.280]  I'm sure I could get used to it because I like I do like and it's you know, it's funny
[04:55.280 --> 05:02.040]  I because I'd like a real old-fashioned mechanical clicky keyboard, right? But that's just what I prefer. So anything less than that is
[05:02.760 --> 05:07.080]  It's you know, fine. It's it's not what I prefer but it's fine. Yeah
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.320]  Yeah, I think I think for me the the baseline is some motion
[05:12.840 --> 05:13.920]  But
[05:13.920 --> 05:18.600]  Glass is not it's not really gonna cut it. I was I was at I'm trying to remember
[05:18.600 --> 05:21.720]  I think this was when Hank broke the screen of his
[05:23.520 --> 05:26.200]  iPhone 6s. Yes success
[05:27.360 --> 05:34.940]  and over the summer we went in there and one of the genius that was helping me was typing on her iPad and just like
[05:34.940 --> 05:36.940]  I mean look like
[05:37.200 --> 05:39.200]  65 70 words a minute. I mean it was crazy
[05:39.200 --> 05:46.560]  I guess, you know, maybe people maybe people now, you know the kids these days maybe coming up learning how to type on glass
[05:47.080 --> 05:53.440]  Screens much faster than we can. Yeah, I've spoken to some people at Apple who've said and this was like from a couple years ago that
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.440]  yes that you know and and
[05:57.280 --> 06:00.080]  Like in the interim since I've had this discussion with people at Apple
[06:00.080 --> 06:05.080]  They've come out with the the smart keyboard cover for iPad which has physical moving keys
[06:05.080 --> 06:10.160]  So it's not like they're saying hey, you know, we don't need physical moving keys, but that you know
[06:10.760 --> 06:16.680]  Don't under if you say you can't type on an iPad don't don't assume that that means everybody can't type and the younger it goes
[06:16.680 --> 06:24.160]  The you know, the more natural it seems because it's just what they grew up with. Yeah. Yeah now and you're you're missing a thumb, right?
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.640]  Yes, that is correct. So I would think that's even harder
[06:28.640 --> 06:34.080]  And my left my left I mean it's it's not missing it's missing it's missing it's missing it's missing it's missing it
[06:34.080 --> 06:38.200]  I mean, it's it's not miss it's there. It's just kind of hanging on by like a thread right exactly
[06:38.820 --> 06:40.820]  You know where it is. I
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.360]  Do have I did suffer an injury and I don't know what happened my left ring finger
[06:47.960 --> 06:50.600]  Feels like the the the first knuckle
[06:52.040 --> 06:56.680]  Like I we used to call him dummies when I was in my high school basketball
[06:56.680 --> 07:01.660]  Like you'd get a dummied finger like so your finger wasn't broken didn't have a broken bone, but you couldn't feel it
[07:01.660 --> 07:06.280]  No, but you know like I've even in basketball it happens all the time if you catch a ball the wrong way
[07:06.280 --> 07:10.800]  But if it you know, you it would swell up at the knuckle real bad, okay
[07:11.800 --> 07:14.400]  And you wouldn't be able to like flex it all the way but you know
[07:14.400 --> 07:16.400]  You could like tape it up and it'd be alright
[07:18.120 --> 07:23.920]  It's just one of those little things where you get old and stuff doesn't heal quickly like I don't know what happened
[07:23.920 --> 07:28.840]  I know it was over summer though because I know that I noticed it when my family was on vacation in this
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.360]  So this was like early August and I was like, I don't know what the heck I did
[07:32.360 --> 07:36.240]  Like if I jammed it on a door or what the heck I did but I noticed I woke up one morning on my left
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.200]  Index finger was swollen and hurt like swollen enough that I wouldn't be able to get my wedding ring off
[07:41.560 --> 07:47.860]  You know, I still can't and now it's the end of October. Yeah, I still can't and it still hurts a little bit
[07:48.720 --> 07:53.920]  And it just seems like the sort of thing like when I was like 17 like you I could say it would be injured 10
[07:53.920 --> 07:58.820]  Times worse like like a golf ball swollen and three days later. It would be back to normal
[08:00.760 --> 08:03.920]  You realize me in trouble you're gonna be trouble in trouble if Amy leaves you
[08:05.680 --> 08:07.680]  Get the jaws of life out
[08:08.300 --> 08:14.800]  You realize you do realize I realize as as I rock it through in in the deeper into my 40s that when you're a young
[08:14.800 --> 08:19.360]  Person you really are sort of your you've sort of like halfway to like being like Wolverine
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.360]  You
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.360]  Don't appreciate it at the time, but as you get older you definitely don't appreciate it
[08:28.040 --> 08:35.120]  Yeah, yeah, I find I found that I like I'm you know a bit older than you but but I bruise I get these bruises now
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.560]  And they don't they just like stick around for like a month
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.480]  They don't hurt or anything, but it's like where did how did that happen? And why won't it go away? I
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.920]  I have the same thing. I will occasionally pick up a bruise like on the back of my elbow, right?
[08:50.920 --> 08:56.120]  And it's like I don't remember it hitting anything. I don't think it happens. Why well, I'm asleep
[08:57.800 --> 09:03.600]  And they don't they don't go away like they roll over too fast and boom I got a bruise
[09:06.880 --> 09:09.680]  So, what do we know we do? All right, so what's coming at this event?
[09:09.680 --> 09:16.800]  The math pros is the guarantee. Right? Right. That's like that's the one thing that we've seen some pictures of
[09:17.360 --> 09:20.480]  There have been fairly hefty rumors about yeah, Germin
[09:20.480 --> 09:26.800]  I think maybe gets credit for breaking it first with this they're replacing the F keys above the keyboard with some kind of
[09:27.360 --> 09:34.480]  Some kind of touchscreen. I don't know somebody at some point. Somebody says it's an OLED. I don't know if that's true or not
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.920]  That'll tie into the next discussion about the what do you call it the Google pixel that I that I got last week
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.320]  Because I gotta tell you I still even though people say they like this pixel display
[09:44.320 --> 09:48.720]  I still don't like the colors on an OLED display, but that's really that's neither here nor there
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.600]  right now
[09:51.840 --> 09:58.320]  Some kind of touchscreen strip and the idea would be that it's therefore because it's software you could you know
[09:58.320 --> 10:00.720]  Photoshop could put like a bunch of tools in it and it's not going to work
[10:00.720 --> 10:05.280]  because it's software you could you know it Photoshop could put like a bunch of tools up there or
[10:05.920 --> 10:07.920]  presumably, you know, maybe like
[10:08.480 --> 10:10.480]  You know a word processor could put
[10:10.960 --> 10:12.240]  style
[10:12.240 --> 10:17.840]  Stuff you could just tap like a bold button or something like that. Yeah, I don't know. Um
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.400]  So 13 inch 15 inch MacBook Pros, they're supposed to be thinner and then there is a case leaking. Did you see this thing?
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.800]  there's somebody in China leaked a
[10:26.800 --> 10:28.800]  Uh
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.760]  Like the top of the case or the unibody enclosure and I think
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.760]  uh
[10:35.760 --> 10:37.920]  according to the leak it's like
[10:38.800 --> 10:45.920]  It's got four USB-C ports like two on each side still has a headphone jack and then that's it. So no more USB-A ports
[10:46.300 --> 10:47.840]  USB-A is the
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.360]  the traditional
[10:49.360 --> 10:56.900]  Big sort of rectangular rectangular one. Yeah USB port that we've known and loved since the iMac in 1998
[10:57.680 --> 10:59.680]  So no more USB-A ports
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.400]  and no more
[11:03.120 --> 11:05.120]  SD card slot
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.680]  No more. What else does the MacBook Pro have? I think it has HDMI, right?
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.120]  Uh, I think so. I think HDMI is the one the one that I'm always trying to plug something into
[11:15.120 --> 11:17.120]  It
[11:18.560 --> 11:20.560]  And it doesn't work
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.640]  So that's the rumor it's probably true I bet because it sounds right to me
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.640]  Yeah
[11:26.640 --> 11:28.640]  Yeah, that makes that makes some sense
[11:29.360 --> 11:31.360]  um and
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.200]  I you know, I've been using a MacBook here for four years, but um if it's thinner
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  I might go back to the 13-inch MacBook Pro
[11:40.880 --> 11:43.040]  Yeah, HDMI there it is on the current one
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.600]  um power to USB
[11:47.840 --> 11:49.840]  The heck is that one
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.400]  So I think I don't know how this is that some of the stuff that I
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.480]  I feel like I'm getting old and I'm out of date on some of this stuff. So
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.000]  USB-C I know based on the
[12:02.640 --> 12:09.280]  Retina MacBook that you can use USB-C for lots of stuff. So it you know, the retina MacBook has one port
[12:09.280 --> 12:17.200]  It's USB-C. It uses it to charge and it uses it to connect to a display and it uses it because you can do like
[12:17.920 --> 12:19.920]  a thunderbolt over
[12:20.060 --> 12:21.200]  USB-C
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.640]  uh, and it uses it obviously to connect to any USB peripherals you wanted to connect to like
[12:27.360 --> 12:31.040]  So if if this new MacBook Pro only has four USB-C ports
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.520]  Then if you wanted to like plug it into power and plug in a peripheral and plug it into a display
[12:37.520 --> 12:41.280]  Would you be able to use any of these ports to plug the display into or is there going to be like?
[12:41.440 --> 12:44.560]  Well, this is the you know, you got to use this top left one for the display
[12:45.680 --> 12:48.720]  Oh, that's a good question. I would think you'd be able to use any of them, but I don't you know
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.880]  In the past that some of there have been differences in the USB ports like some of them have different have had different power
[12:55.600 --> 12:57.600]  output
[12:57.920 --> 13:05.120]  Yeah, I don't know and how would they differentiate it seems very unapple-like to to require you to remember that these four points that look
[13:05.200 --> 13:06.800]  the same
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.880]  Actually are different. I mean, I guess what they could do is is print like a little I don't know some kind of little
[13:13.680 --> 13:15.680]  icon next to the one that
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.960]  You know, but that doesn't seem right
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.040]  It seems like you should be able to use any of them for anything, but I don't know if electronically that works out
[13:21.200 --> 13:23.200]  I don't know. Yeah
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.000]  I mean, I guess that so yeah, and that's just part of the
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.800]  Is apple doing the lightning or not the lightning the um
[13:32.800 --> 13:35.760]  What's the line
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.200]  Does USB-C have
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.080]  The Thunderbolt in it. Yes
[13:44.800 --> 13:49.840]  Yeah, but I mean it but is that Apple's doing or is that the USB-C standard? I think it's the USB-C standard
[13:49.840 --> 13:55.200]  I think it has some something to do with Intel. Okay. Well, then then I don't know why they wouldn't all have it, right?
[13:55.200 --> 13:58.640]  Then I don't know why they wouldn't all have it, right, um
[14:04.240 --> 14:07.280]  It sounds like a good update to me, I I don't know I mean and
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.400]  Suppose, you know, the whole thing is going to be thinner. Presumably one of the reasons they're getting rid of
[14:13.900 --> 14:18.160]  Usba is just because by today's standards, that's a big fat port
[14:18.720 --> 14:22.240]  I'm not saying that the device is actually you know, the device is obviously not going to be
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.840]  No matter how thin it is. It's not going to be so thin that they couldn't put a USB a port in but I think
[14:27.840 --> 14:31.520]  You know, you could I think it's probably going to be thin enough where USB a would look ugly
[14:32.240 --> 14:33.280]  Yeah
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.680]  And you know, we all know the most important thing when you buy a computer is making sure that the ports look nice
[14:40.880 --> 14:45.600]  Vgs are gonna be a VGA port there will be a dongle for big
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.960]  I've always been a little bus the VGA port. I've even used it. I have you know, I still use
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.320]  Some standalone cameras. So, you know, I have SD cards and I have used it
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.880]  You know the SD the the SD slot on my MacBook Pro on occasion
[15:00.880 --> 15:06.080]  I've always thought it was a little surprising that Apple put an SD card slot in the Mac book Pro
[15:06.080 --> 15:11.680]  Yes, because and and it's thin, you know, and I would presume that they could do it on the new one by
[15:11.680 --> 15:16.160]  You know, it's certainly a pretty thin little slot. It just seems like an on-apple like thing to do though
[15:16.160 --> 15:18.240]  It seems to me like if you want to use a card, you know
[15:18.240 --> 15:20.880]  They they want you to be punished by having to use a dongle
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.800]  And I say that I'm being a little facetious but it's just I don't know apples, you know
[15:26.800 --> 15:34.720]  Really takes the minimalism on these ports to an extreme and adding an SD card slot built in is sort of unusual for Apple
[15:34.720 --> 15:36.400]  Yeah, yeah
[15:36.400 --> 15:38.400]  still on the iMac too
[15:38.400 --> 15:44.080]  Yeah, I use that too. I've already said that's my favorite game to play on the iMac is plugging. Yeah. Well, that's the thing
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.200]  Yeah, I mean on the back of the device it becomes very difficult. I've gotten very good at it
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.240]  I've gotten very good at sitting at my desk not being able to see get an SD card is into the
[15:55.440 --> 15:58.080]  Into the slot in the back. I can't even plug USB
[15:58.880 --> 16:04.640]  Things into the back of mine. I tweeted that and a bunch of people I hadn't thought about this because I never owned one of the
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.560]  side-loading iMacs, you know before they got the real thin sides
[16:09.600 --> 16:11.600]  The slot was on the side
[16:12.480 --> 16:17.120]  Which is in theory the SD card was yeah. Oh really? Okay. And yeah, I missed that
[16:17.120 --> 16:23.200]  They also had CD slots over there though. And so apparently a real common problem. Oh, it was very I mean
[16:23.200 --> 16:25.200]  I wouldn't believe how many
[16:25.200 --> 16:30.560]  Yeah, it's and then everybody played along with my idea that this was a great game and they were like is
[16:30.560 --> 16:34.080]  Oh, man, it's a good way to lose all of your lives
[16:36.080 --> 16:37.520]  Is you just
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.320]  Tuck it in and the second you let go of it and like, you know get it all the way in you realize what you've done
[16:42.320 --> 16:45.840]  Oh god, that's terrible. And then you got to fish it out. Yeah
[16:47.040 --> 16:49.040]  Better have better to have it on the back
[16:51.440 --> 16:53.040]  So, uh, yeah macbook
[16:53.040 --> 16:59.760]  So, uh, yeah macbook pro and and then everything else is just
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.320]  Maybe yeah, so there is there's rumors of a new 13-inch model and this is to me where
[17:08.640 --> 17:12.800]  Me and you are in our pundit points because the you know macbook pro is a little self-explanatory
[17:12.800 --> 17:17.920]  But what is this 13-inch macbook pro? Some people are calling it a macbook air mingle
[17:17.920 --> 17:23.120]  Chiquo of of kgi uh securities or whatever his company is called
[17:23.680 --> 17:28.080]  The analyst who gets he gets a lot wrong actually, uh, philip emmer de whit has an interesting
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.200]  Scorecard for his like last three years of predictions, but his iphone stuff is usually spot on. Yeah
[17:33.680 --> 17:36.080]  Usually he just gets wrong the timing right?
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.880]  He's not that great on timing and he's and he's like every you know, he's really
[17:42.320 --> 17:44.320]  Uh, you know, he's really
[17:44.320 --> 17:50.160]  Not an apple analyst so much as an apple asian supply chain analyst like his sources are very clearly
[17:50.160 --> 17:53.200]  It's almost transparent that his sources are from the asian supply chain
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.400]  So he doesn't get things like product marketing because the asian supply chain doesn't know about stuff like that
[17:58.720 --> 18:03.120]  Like what's the name of the device going to be they don't know that until the last minute and they start printing it?
[18:04.560 --> 18:06.560]  You know on the devices
[18:07.760 --> 18:10.800]  And they still you know pricing and stuff like that nobody knows what the price is
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.400]  Pricing is like the top-held secret at apple like there's only you know
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.200]  Very seldom leaks because I don't think it ever really leaves, you know it from in between like schiller's group and uh,
[18:21.600 --> 18:23.600]  tim cook, you know and
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.160]  Uh, well and surely jeff williams, but you know, it's like a top people type thing
[18:29.520 --> 18:30.560]  Right
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.400]  And whoever's making the web page so he he's been calling it a macbook air for a while a new 13 inch or maybe he's been
[18:36.400 --> 18:40.400]  calling it a macbook air for a while a new 13 inch or maybe he's been calling it a macbook air for a while a new 13 inch or
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.320]  Maybe he's been calling it a macbook. I don't know but the idea that they would make uh
[18:45.760 --> 18:51.760]  A 13 inch macbook like the 12 inch macbook makes no sense to me like 13. I don't understand that either I
[18:52.640 --> 18:54.640]  you need like two inches to have
[18:55.440 --> 18:57.440]  a separation that
[18:57.440 --> 19:03.600]  Makes sense, you know, like oh, yeah, I can see this 13 inch is sort of like yeah regular size and the 15 inches big
[19:03.600 --> 19:10.320]  And this oh and this 11 inch is tiny 12 and 13 are way too close to each other. So that doesn't make any sense to me
[19:10.320 --> 19:15.440]  Plus it doesn't seem like I mean, it seems like it's a little early to to bring out a new macbook
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.400]  Right because the the current ones only came out I think in april, right? Right, right
[19:22.080 --> 19:25.680]  So if so, so then the speculation is that it's an error
[19:27.520 --> 19:28.560]  Right
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.200]  And you know, some people have speculated nobody seems to be willing to commit not not ming qi quote not german
[19:35.200 --> 19:38.240]  nobody is saying what what kind of display this thing has which is
[19:38.940 --> 19:43.440]  Unconspicuous to me because it would like so they're just not mentioning it meaning
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.320]  Does it have a retina display?
[19:46.400 --> 19:50.000]  Which is certainly what people who are hoping for a retina macbook air are hoping for
[19:50.480 --> 19:55.040]  uh, if it doesn't have a retina display is the display improved at all versus the
[19:55.040 --> 19:58.480]  Existing macbook errors because there's things I think like I don't think that
[19:59.200 --> 20:05.200]  I forget there's certain technical things even if it doesn't go retina that could be improved in the the macbook air display
[20:05.920 --> 20:08.640]  Like I think like ips and stuff like that. Okay
[20:11.520 --> 20:13.520]  I don't know. Nobody knows
[20:14.640 --> 20:16.240]  That's why it's exciting
[20:16.240 --> 20:22.160]  Uh, the idea I guess is that if it needs it i'm a little surprised that they're updating it all i've been
[20:22.160 --> 20:29.520]  I've been of under the assumption that the macbook air is only hanging around to occupy price points like eight right that
[20:29.740 --> 20:35.200]  8.99 that the 11 inch started at and the 9.99 the 13 inch started at and that there's no other reason
[20:35.520 --> 20:41.200]  For those devices to exist and so that apple would just keep selling the old ones as long as keep people keep buying them
[20:41.820 --> 20:43.820]  exactly like the
[20:45.440 --> 20:50.320]  There's still that old macbook pro that has a spinning cd drive that apple sells
[20:50.320 --> 20:56.400]  Um, they don't really advertise it. They don't have it out in the apple stores. But if you go online you can still buy it
[20:58.160 --> 21:03.760]  That has a cd drive even I think so let me check this definitely has it definitely has a spinning hard drive
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.800]  Maybe it doesn't. Yeah, I think it's just a spinning hard drive. All right, it doesn't have it. No, it does not have a cd drive
[21:08.800 --> 21:11.120]  All right, whatever. Yeah, does it have a floppy drive?
[21:12.720 --> 21:17.360]  Or zip drive has a zip drive it's got it's got swappable bays, but you can take the zip drive
[21:17.360 --> 21:21.840]  You can take the zip drive out and put a jazz drive in
[21:23.600 --> 21:25.920]  Is that what that works? Yeah. Yeah
[21:29.360 --> 21:31.360]  I got one of those upstairs
[21:31.360 --> 21:37.600]  A jazz drive? No, I don't know. I don't have the drive. I do. I have an old um, our pal jim ray gave me his old. Um,
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.240]  God, what is it? It's uh, I think it's a wall street. Um,
[21:42.240 --> 21:47.280]  What was it called power book? Oh, yeah with the with the thing that you could pop out I think
[21:47.920 --> 21:52.720]  Does did that one have that anyway? It's a really old I have a really old power book upstairs
[21:56.160 --> 22:04.400]  Well, anyway apple still sells at some sort of ancient macbook pro that I can't even remember the details of that is only there because people keep buying it
[22:06.720 --> 22:08.720]  Yeah
[22:08.720 --> 22:17.280]  Um, yeah, I mean I would I would think that now is the time just to be going all retina and
[22:19.520 --> 22:25.920]  They would sweep away that one and then the air but these rumors seem to indicate maybe not
[22:27.920 --> 22:29.040]  Here we go
[22:29.040 --> 22:34.000]  It's at the bottom of the macbook pro page and it costs one thousand ninety nine dollars, right?
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.040]  So it is, uh, it has a 500 gigabyte 5400 rpm hard drive. So that's what I was thinking of. Yeah
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.920]  Uh, I guess it's like some of these apple products seem to me like
[22:46.960 --> 22:50.720]  Products from the past like I don't I can't imagine
[22:51.760 --> 22:55.280]  Like I splurged when I bought the I happened that is my iMac is almost two years old now
[22:55.280 --> 23:01.760]  But that was the last device i've bought where I was maybe possibly even thinking vaguely
[23:01.760 --> 23:06.640]  I might still get a spinning hard drive. I thought maybe about because the upgrade to get like a full one
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.800]  Terabyte ssd was seriously expensive
[23:12.560 --> 23:16.640]  But of course I love to spend money so I just got it but it was the last time I even
[23:17.040 --> 23:20.880]  Hesitated for a second and thought maybe I should just get the the fusion drive
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.680]  So I you know and I realized as I bought this iMac that it'll be the last
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.880]  That whatever the previous Mac I bought was the last you know, i'm never going to buy a spinning hard drive
[23:30.880 --> 23:34.880]  I'm never going to buy a spinning hard disk. Yeah inside inside a Mac again
[23:35.520 --> 23:42.080]  Yeah, maybe on external drive, you know just for backup or whatever but not inside and I don't think i'd ever buy personally
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.680]  I would never buy another
[23:43.680 --> 23:45.680]  device without a redness screen
[23:45.680 --> 23:49.280]  Mm-hmm. But yeah, and so that's the and that's the other thing that's the hard drive
[23:49.280 --> 23:51.600]  I would think that now would be a also a good time
[23:51.680 --> 23:55.280]  They probably well this they probably won't do because it seems like it's too ubiquitous across
[23:55.280 --> 24:01.520]  Several different product lines but to get rid of someday someday soon. They need to get rid of the spinning drives fusion's
[24:01.520 --> 24:05.360]  not bad fusion works fine, but um, the solely spinning drives or
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.160]  All right, I would never buy one, right?
[24:08.640 --> 24:10.400]  so
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.080]  The conundrum I see I thought that maybe the air would just stay as it is with its crummy non-retina
[24:16.560 --> 24:20.080]  displays and just sit at those price points until the the
[24:20.080 --> 24:25.120]  The retina macbook could be sold for like 999 and then they would just get rid of that
[24:25.200 --> 24:31.760]  The errors would just silently disappear and there'd be maybe uh at whatever point in the future this happens a year old
[24:32.080 --> 24:35.680]  Retina macbook that sells at 999 or 899 even
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.600]  and a newer
[24:37.600 --> 24:39.600]  retina macbook with better specs that
[24:40.320 --> 24:42.880]  sells at 1299 or 1399, you know
[24:44.400 --> 24:47.440]  That's what I expected but it's you know based on these rumors
[24:47.440 --> 24:54.240]  It seems as though the air might be sticking around but again, is it going to be called a macbook air? I don't know
[24:54.960 --> 24:57.440]  Yeah, the macbook starts at 1300 books
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.200]  so
[24:59.200 --> 25:01.200]  It's still a little pricey too
[25:01.600 --> 25:06.800]  I mean, it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like they would they could drop just summarily take 300 off
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.960]  Right now and it only came out in april. So that's just way, you know, six months later
[25:10.960 --> 25:18.400]  It's a we highly unusual for apple to drop a product by 30 in price or yeah, whatever it is. It's about 30
[25:21.280 --> 25:26.240]  It just doesn't seem possible but then what price would this macbook be this is the problem I see is
[25:26.560 --> 25:28.560]  If it's a retina macbook air
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.260]  What price does it start at because if it starts at 999?
[25:33.440 --> 25:39.280]  That seems like a great deal and it doesn't seem preposterous given that there are competing products from other companies
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.640]  You know that have roughly the similar specs. Like I think like let's just say like a microsoft surface, which has
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.440]  um, you know, I think roughly air quality, you know,
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.560]  CPU from intel and it has a retina screen and it's you know as a starting price under a thousand dollars
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.720]  So it's not it's not like i'm, you know again you whenever you're on the show. We all we often play let's spend tim cook's money
[26:03.520 --> 26:05.700]  We're not just saying let's make it 999
[26:06.640 --> 26:08.400]  you know because we're
[26:08.400 --> 26:15.440]  We're not based on reality. It seems like based on on other laptops from other companies that you could do a retina
[26:15.760 --> 26:17.760]  screen on a 999
[26:18.240 --> 26:21.360]  Device. Yeah, but if they did that who buys
[26:22.080 --> 26:24.080]  you know what that to me that makes the
[26:24.880 --> 26:28.000]  The regular macbook at 12.99 look too expensive
[26:30.240 --> 26:31.520]  Yep
[26:31.520 --> 26:36.320]  It sure does especially since it's slower and I realize it's slower because it's to be that thin
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.000]  It has a fanless design and so it's got like this entirely different
[26:40.640 --> 26:41.840]  um
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.580]  Uses an entirely different chipset from intel that is designed so that it could run and fanlessly
[26:47.120 --> 26:53.360]  And never overheat and the air uses like this mid-range chip chipset that is low power compared to like the pros
[26:53.680 --> 26:55.680]  But not so low power that it doesn't need a fan
[26:56.160 --> 26:58.160]  Yeah
[26:58.960 --> 27:00.960]  I don't know. I mean they
[27:02.240 --> 27:05.360]  They have spent I mean there's been number of years where they've
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.880]  their entry
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.640]  Laptop was 999 right in somewhere. It was even more than that. I think but that was a long time ago. Yeah
[27:13.760 --> 27:14.880]  and
[27:14.880 --> 27:16.160]  They are
[27:16.160 --> 27:18.160]  in an era where
[27:18.560 --> 27:20.880]  It's increasingly hard to sell computers
[27:22.320 --> 27:24.320]  So
[27:25.040 --> 27:28.560]  Moving your starting price point up a hundred bucks
[27:30.400 --> 27:33.920]  I don't know if that's gonna I mean that's not gonna be great if you want to move units
[27:33.920 --> 27:37.440]  And there's compounded with this is another rumor
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.440]  About thursday's update to the mac line that the 11-inch air is going to just quote go away. Yeah
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.120]  I wouldn't be surprised if no I wouldn't either if it did if it vanished
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.920]  But I also wouldn't be surprised if it sort of goes the way of that 13-inch ancient macbook pro that we were talking about
[27:55.920 --> 28:01.280]  Where it goes away in terms of it. It really is never going to be updated again. Not even like a minor
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.480]  Spec refresh but that they'll keep selling it as is and not even really promote it but it's there
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.960]  You can go on the website budget. Yeah, maybe the drop. Maybe even drop the price to 7.99 or something. Yeah
[28:13.520 --> 28:15.520]  That would be really kind of amazing
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.560]  Because I don't think they've ever I don't think they've ever been that low. No, I think 8.99 is the lowest apple's ever sold
[28:20.560 --> 28:27.520]  Yeah, mac for and that's you know, that's been the 11-inch air for a while a laptop. Yeah, right right not counting something incomplete
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.280]  Like the Mac Mini. Yeah, like a complete laptop system that you can just open the box and use
[28:33.920 --> 28:38.720]  Mm-hmm, like it's not missing, you know has no RAM. It has no RAM at all
[28:41.760 --> 28:43.760]  It doesn't have a battery
[28:44.160 --> 28:46.160]  Gotta plug it in everywhere you go
[28:47.760 --> 28:51.440]  And plug in an external hard drive. Do you remember do you remember years ago? There was a rumor
[28:51.440 --> 28:57.840]  About a crank-powered man apple laptop. No, I don't think so. Like the one
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.480]  Like back in the 90s like what after after jobs had come back
[29:03.840 --> 29:07.520]  And I think after the iMac had been introduced
[29:08.480 --> 29:12.960]  There were these rumors coming around about the iBook and what it was going to be
[29:13.680 --> 29:14.720]  and
[29:14.720 --> 29:16.240]  and one of the
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.020]  ones like one of the crazier rumor sites was that it was uh, it was going to be it was going to be crank-powered
[29:25.520 --> 29:31.520]  And what a boon that would be to people because you know for all those instances where you're running shy like if you were camping
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.520]  Such a common scenario, right? Right and you needed to use your laptop. You could just crank power it
[29:40.400 --> 29:42.400]  So I think that's a good idea
[29:42.400 --> 29:45.280]  Did you use your laptop? You could just crank power it
[29:46.240 --> 29:49.680]  So I know that there are build to order options that can make these prices
[29:50.400 --> 29:56.000]  Higher but right now looking at the buy a macbook air page. There's two 11 inch air standard configs
[29:56.560 --> 30:05.220]  $8.99 and then you're up two hundred dollars to ten ninety nine and you get double the storage you go from 128 to 256
[30:07.120 --> 30:08.160]  And
[30:08.160 --> 30:10.720]  It doesn't look like it doesn't look like you get anything else
[30:10.720 --> 30:17.440]  That's about the only difference and then there's a 13 inch macbook air that starts at $9.99. That's weird and one that's uh,
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.760]  $200 higher at $1,199 call it twelve hundred dollars
[30:23.920 --> 30:29.600]  And I think the only difference there is double the storage from 128 flash to
[30:30.320 --> 30:32.800]  256. Yeah, and it's weird to me that the 13 inch
[30:34.320 --> 30:36.960]  comes in eight gigs comes with eight gigs of memory and the
[30:36.960 --> 30:42.000]  11 does not right. I don't know. I I guess if you hit select though. Can you you can configure?
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.520]  Yeah, you can definitely configure you can so you get up it and you can see significantly upgrade the CPU you can go from
[30:48.080 --> 30:49.040]  1.6
[30:49.040 --> 30:51.040]  Core i5 to a 2.2 core i7
[30:51.840 --> 30:55.120]  Yeah, and I don't stay up to date on all that stuff anymore
[30:55.120 --> 31:02.080]  But I mean, I know enough about the basic just that going from core i5 to core i7 is pretty significant performance upgrade, right?
[31:02.080 --> 31:09.680]  Pretty significant performance upgrade, right? Um, but they're not the standard configs and I feel like the standard configs really matter
[31:10.160 --> 31:11.120]  um
[31:11.120 --> 31:15.280]  but what i'm guessing if I had to guess what apple is going to do is
[31:15.920 --> 31:18.800]  I'm thinking that the entry level 13 inch macbook air
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.840]  Will still not have a retina screen
[31:22.480 --> 31:28.880]  And I guess if it's true that they're getting rid of the 11 maybe it the 13 inch macbook air will now start at $8.99
[31:28.960 --> 31:30.960]  But that it's a non-retina screen
[31:30.960 --> 31:34.320]  And that if you want to get retina you're going to have to pay at least like 1200 bucks
[31:35.280 --> 31:36.080]  Yeah
[31:36.080 --> 31:40.400]  And then but it still seems weird to me that you could pay like around 1200 bucks
[31:40.800 --> 31:45.760]  To get a 13 inch macbook air with all these ports and then there's the 12 inch
[31:46.560 --> 31:48.240]  retina macbook
[31:48.240 --> 31:49.520]  at the
[31:49.520 --> 31:51.520]  1300 starting price
[31:51.440 --> 31:52.480]  like
[31:52.480 --> 31:56.800]  It just seems weird to me that they're that they're doing a new retina macbook air
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.120]  MacBook air the other thing I could see is that they upgrade
[32:01.280 --> 32:05.680]  This is the other thing I could see is they upgrade the 13 inch macbook air to whatever the latest
[32:06.320 --> 32:08.000]  core i7
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Whatever mobile chipset is from intel
[32:10.720 --> 32:15.280]  But they don't even really talk about it on thursday. They just upgrade it on the website
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.880]  And it still doesn't have a retina screen and anybody who wants to bitch about the fact that it doesn't have a retina screen
[32:21.360 --> 32:24.160]  You know buy a diff buy a different macbook. Mm-hmm
[32:24.160 --> 32:26.160]  Yeah, that seems to make the most sense to me
[32:27.040 --> 32:31.040]  Because I can't imagine them going to the trouble putting a retina into
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.200]  The air at this point right and I feel like you can argue
[32:35.200 --> 32:41.840]  Well, there's other comp, you know the argument that hey like the microsoft surface has a retinal caliber screen and it's only 999
[32:42.400 --> 32:47.440]  Or whatever and you know del makes these things with you know, whatever they call retina screens and they're cheap
[32:47.760 --> 32:50.640]  And it's like, you know, apple's never competed at the low end on price
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.520]  And if anybody gets the short end of the stick from apple, it's absolutely the people who are more budget-conscious
[32:55.520 --> 32:57.520]  That's just the way the company is
[32:58.080 --> 33:04.800]  Yeah, you know it's the company is optimized in my opinion for people who are looking for the best products
[33:04.800 --> 33:07.520]  Not not the lowest priced products. Yeah
[33:10.560 --> 33:12.800]  Because the other thing too is in addition to
[33:15.200 --> 33:19.120]  The just the fact that the regular retina macbook is relatively cheap
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.200]  The regular retina macbook is relatively new
[33:21.760 --> 33:28.800]  It's clearly what apple thinks the future of laptops are there's also just the simple fact that they gave it the name macbook, right?
[33:28.960 --> 33:34.000]  It's like yeah, it's not like we're reading into it's not like it's hard to read into that
[33:34.480 --> 33:40.240]  That by calling it just plain macbook with no adjective that apple is saying, you know, maybe not now but soon
[33:40.400 --> 33:44.000]  This is the standard. This is what you this is what the standard apple laptop is
[33:44.640 --> 33:46.480]  Yeah
[33:46.480 --> 33:50.240]  And it really is weird to have ones called air that are thicker and heavier
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.000]  Like it makes no sense
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.920]  Well, yeah, I mean that just seems to be why it's obvious that it seemed obvious at least that it was going away
[34:00.640 --> 34:05.600]  Right. So it seems very strange that there's these rumors that it's sticking around. I mean the other thing they
[34:06.160 --> 34:08.160]  It wouldn't be the first time that they have
[34:09.020 --> 34:10.800]  updated
[34:10.800 --> 34:13.360]  A model that's only been out for like six months
[34:14.320 --> 34:16.160]  Because they did it with the ipad
[34:16.160 --> 34:18.160]  Yeah, they did that with the ipad
[34:18.240 --> 34:24.320]  Three three, right and then the ipad 4 came out like six months later because the ipad 3 was sort of sort of thicker
[34:24.560 --> 34:27.600]  You know, it was the first retina one, I believe right? Yeah. Yeah
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.240]  I could see it, you know and again with the pc stuff. It seems you know, I don't think that they're
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.080]  Anywhere near as constrained, you know
[34:38.880 --> 34:40.880]  uh
[34:40.880 --> 34:47.380]  component wise as they are with especially the iphone but probably the ipad 2 where they kind of need to
[34:48.100 --> 34:52.580]  Get their ducks in a row and say look we're going to have you know
[34:53.220 --> 34:58.420]  70 million of these system on the chips for the next year for all these iphone 7s and they're all going to be exactly the same
[34:58.740 --> 35:03.460]  Like I don't I think with the macbook, you know, it's not anywhere near as you know
[35:03.460 --> 35:08.500]  we need to be making the exact same device for an entire year just to break even on the
[35:08.500 --> 35:10.260]  on the
[35:10.260 --> 35:12.260]  manufacturing
[35:13.460 --> 35:19.140]  What I would like to see which is probably not going to happen though is it is an 11 inch macbook a 13 inch macbook
[35:20.900 --> 35:25.140]  But I I kind of do too the fact that they've the fact that they've done a 12 inch now though
[35:25.300 --> 35:26.900]  That doesn't seem like that's going to happen
[35:26.900 --> 35:33.620]  Yeah, and i'm not sure how the i've never actually put like the 12 inch next to the 11 inch macbook air and just seen
[35:33.620 --> 35:39.620]  How they compare because I think that the display does kind of go more edge to edge on the macbook like footprint wise
[35:39.620 --> 35:41.620]  They might be very similar
[35:42.660 --> 35:46.420]  Yeah, I think they are so I kind of feel I mean it seems like I mean I you know
[35:46.420 --> 35:53.620]  I've only played with one um a few times but uh, it does not seem demonstrably larger than the 11 inch air. Yeah
[35:54.660 --> 35:57.060]  Let's see what the tech specs actually you can yeah, we can find that out
[35:58.500 --> 36:00.500]  So it is 11 inches
[36:00.500 --> 36:06.260]  The macbook is 11 inches wide and 7.74 deep
[36:06.740 --> 36:12.680]  All right, the 11 inch macbook air is 11.8 inches wide and 7.56
[36:13.220 --> 36:18.660]  Inches deep so on depth. Yeah, it's almost the same but it is right. It is a
[36:19.300 --> 36:21.300]  eight tenths of an inch narrower
[36:22.660 --> 36:24.660]  The but the
[36:25.300 --> 36:28.660]  The 12 inch macbook is narrower. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah
[36:28.660 --> 36:31.220]  Yeah, it's the other way around. Yeah, i'm an idiot. Yeah
[36:31.940 --> 36:38.180]  Yeah, so the 12 inch macbook is actually smaller right? Well, but it's deeper, right? Yeah, but just by a little bit
[36:38.180 --> 36:43.060]  All right, so maybe with that design maybe what it would be would be a 14 inch
[36:43.140 --> 36:48.900]  You know, maybe 12 12 inch and 14 inch 14 inch I could see that and then maybe the rumors are wrong calling it
[36:49.060 --> 36:55.300]  13 calling it 13 because maybe it's one of those things where it's like, I don't know 13 point something
[36:55.300 --> 37:02.340]  I don't know 13 point something and apple's just going to it's close enough to 14 that apple's going to call it 14. Yeah
[37:05.620 --> 37:08.100]  I could see that as a way to square this circle as well
[37:08.260 --> 37:12.500]  If the truth is that there is no update to the macbook air and what they're going to do is
[37:12.660 --> 37:16.980]  Unveil a big brother to the 12 inch retina macbook. I can see that
[37:18.020 --> 37:20.740]  Maybe and then you have a second usb-c port
[37:20.740 --> 37:24.340]  Yeah
[37:24.340 --> 37:27.540]  And then you have laptops at 12 13 14 15
[37:28.740 --> 37:30.740]  Yeah, and that kind of makes some sense
[37:30.740 --> 37:36.340]  Yeah, I suppose although I don't know if it makes sense for the consumer ones to quote unquote have larger displays than the pro ones
[37:36.340 --> 37:37.540]  I don't know
[37:37.540 --> 37:39.140]  well
[37:39.140 --> 37:41.620]  I think some people some people seem to like
[37:42.980 --> 37:44.980]  That 13 inch air
[37:45.460 --> 37:46.980]  i've always been
[37:46.980 --> 37:50.820]  I mean, I always liked the smaller one. But um,
[37:51.620 --> 37:53.620]  you know people who
[37:55.380 --> 37:58.980]  Just want more screen real estate right or people who don't see so well
[37:59.220 --> 38:02.260]  I used an 11 inch for years and many years at least
[38:02.900 --> 38:06.980]  Five years four or five years four years, I think uh and loved it
[38:07.140 --> 38:09.140]  but my thinking at the time was
[38:09.140 --> 38:14.820]  If you're gonna go small and thin go as small and thin as you can and get like so I got a maxed out
[38:14.820 --> 38:20.120]  Performance wise 11 inch air and then when I switched to a 13 inch macbook pro two years ago
[38:20.200 --> 38:22.200]  it was on the basis of if i'm
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.880]  gonna carry something thicker and heavier I might as well get the
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.560]  The pro and get the performance rather than the 13 inch air. Yeah
[38:33.480 --> 38:37.960]  Yeah, and i'm in that i'm in that quandary right now because my uh
[38:37.960 --> 38:44.280]  So my air is four years old and then my uh, my iMac upstairs. Well, I have two machines upstairs
[38:44.280 --> 38:47.720]  That I do use for this sort of media server things one is a 2010
[38:48.680 --> 38:51.960]  MacBook pro and then the other one is a 2007 iMac
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.040]  And those are definitely uh, definitely showing their age
[38:56.200 --> 39:02.440]  So, um, i'm kind of like in that that space where I was like am I gonna buy another like the the low-end laptop?
[39:02.440 --> 39:08.760]  Just to carry around and do writing with or am I gonna split the differentiating and get get the get the pro and
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.680]  Do whatever power stuff I need to do on that well and the other thing too is that by all accounts the pro
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.960]  I mean, of course the pros getting thinner because that's what apple does is they make stuff thinner and the the when they finally got
[39:19.960 --> 39:21.960]  You know the current
[39:21.960 --> 39:27.720]  Models when they are the first ones that you don't even have the option of getting a spinning hard disk in because they're actually too
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.720]  Thin you have to use ssd. The new ones are going to be even thinner. So they're getting as thin as the airs used to be
[39:33.720 --> 39:39.640]  Even if they're not wedge shaped. I mean they're getting they're certainly approaching that like so the air is getting squeezed out to me in
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.880]  Almost every way imaginable. It's getting squeezed out on thinness by the pros. It's getting squeezed out on uh,
[39:46.840 --> 39:52.600]  You know retina screen by the macbook the name macbook tells you that you know, it's becoming the standard
[39:53.800 --> 39:55.800]  default laptop
[39:55.800 --> 39:57.800]  Laptop
[39:58.120 --> 40:02.120]  Everything other than having a low price and if the whole point is to have a low price
[40:02.120 --> 40:04.280]  I don't see how it's going to get a retina screen
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.880]  Just because it makes the other ones look bad but yeah what people I guess the other thing we're talking around is the fact that there
[40:12.040 --> 40:13.720]  are
[40:13.720 --> 40:20.600]  Tens of thousands of people listening to this podcast right now who desperately want apple to just make a macbook air with a retina screen
[40:20.600 --> 40:25.000]  It's probably true right
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.880]  But I really don't think it's going to happen. It reminds me of the switch from the classic mac os to mac os 10 in a way
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.200]  Where what?
[40:34.200 --> 40:40.920]  Die-hard mac users really wanted was a new version of the mac os that was you know, just had the the better
[40:41.800 --> 40:48.940]  Kernel just give us like a real operating system with you know preemptive or not preemptive multitasking with right, you know real multitasking
[40:48.940 --> 40:54.780]  Instead of cooperative. All right preemptive is the good multitasking cooperative multitasking was that was the the euphemism
[40:55.660 --> 40:56.620]  Right
[40:56.620 --> 40:58.620]  Which was not very cooperative
[41:00.140 --> 41:03.040]  I would call it the prisoner's dilemma multitasking
[41:08.620 --> 41:15.820]  Oh wait about right wait I can I me I this I could just use the whole CPU but i'm just asked voluntarily not to
[41:15.820 --> 41:17.820]  Hmm
[41:20.220 --> 41:23.340]  Uh all mac users really wanted i'm going to jail
[41:24.220 --> 41:28.540]  All mac users really wanted was a new version of the mac os that had a stable
[41:29.260 --> 41:36.860]  Uh modern, you know, yeah computer science perspective operating system and instead we we got a thing we got everything was different
[41:37.420 --> 41:38.700]  and
[41:38.700 --> 41:43.340]  A lot of stuff that used to be fast was suddenly very slow to make it fancy, etc, etc
[41:43.340 --> 41:45.340]  To make it fancy, etc, etc
[41:45.660 --> 41:50.700]  And I sort of feel like apple is doing the same thing with the transition from the macbook air to the macbook
[41:50.780 --> 41:56.860]  Which is that what what many people I hear from them every time I bring it up on daring fireball or on this podcast
[41:57.020 --> 42:01.260]  I hear it all the time. I see it on twitter all the time is people
[42:01.900 --> 42:03.660]  like the macbook air
[42:03.660 --> 42:07.500]  or love the macbook air and only thing they don't like about it is the
[42:07.500 --> 42:14.220]  Non retinal screen. And so why doesn't apple just just put a retina screen in the macbook air and they'll just buy it
[42:15.020 --> 42:18.060]  But I don't think it's where apple wants to take things. Yeah
[42:20.620 --> 42:25.900]  Well, what are you gonna do all right, so what about what about uh, what about other
[42:27.340 --> 42:32.540]  Uh other max well, let's let's pick that up after this. Yeah. Let me take a break and tell you about
[42:32.540 --> 42:35.820]  Our first sponsor of the show it's our good friends at casper
[42:36.380 --> 42:40.780]  Casper makes obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices go to casper.com
[42:41.420 --> 42:46.940]  The talk show and use code the talk show you'll save 50 bucks towards your mattress
[42:47.580 --> 42:50.540]  Casper has created one perfect mattress
[42:51.260 --> 42:53.260]  sold directly to consumers
[42:53.420 --> 42:56.860]  eliminating the commission-driven inflated prices of
[42:56.860 --> 43:02.220]  Rat dropping filled mattress retail stores
[43:02.220 --> 43:07.100]  Their award-winning mattress was developed in-house has a sleek design and is delivered in a remarkably small box
[43:07.100 --> 43:09.180]  You should buy one. Honestly, even if you don't need a mattress
[43:09.180 --> 43:12.620]  You should think about buying one just to get the box because it's so fun to open
[43:13.500 --> 43:16.300]  It just makes the coolest noise. It's like a vacuum compressor. It's like
[43:17.580 --> 43:21.980]  I mean you have to be careful because it sucks all the oxygen oxygen out of the room, but
[43:21.980 --> 43:29.420]  Kind of it's kind of a good effect, um, they also now offer adaptive pillows and soft breathable sheets
[43:29.500 --> 43:33.580]  Really nice sheets high cotton or high thread count all that all the buzzwords
[43:33.900 --> 43:39.820]  It's like sleeping in like a five-star luxury hotel bed you get like if you buy the casper sheets and everything in the pillows
[43:39.820 --> 43:44.140]  It's just it's just like super high-end stuff. It's really really nice and
[43:44.780 --> 43:47.180]  It it's it sounds too good to be honest
[43:47.180 --> 43:52.140]  How can the prices be so much lower than the other retail stores? Well, because the other the regular mattress industry
[43:52.140 --> 43:57.100]  It's just a ripoff. It's you know, it's all these markups with these middlemen. You got these sales people
[43:57.500 --> 44:05.420]  They purposefully the other brands that i'm not going to name names, but you know, like sealy they they they they purposefully give their
[44:06.060 --> 44:11.980]  Mattresses these weird names where if you go from one store to another the same mattress like if you cut it open
[44:11.980 --> 44:17.820]  Has like a different name so that you can't price compare. It's it's purposefully made to confuse the consumer
[44:18.220 --> 44:22.780]  And to help the the retail stores sort of obfuscate how much these things really cost
[44:23.660 --> 44:27.580]  Casper sells direct to you. They just make these things and ship them right to you
[44:28.460 --> 44:34.380]  Here's the prices premium mattresses from most stores usually start at over 1,500 bucks
[44:34.380 --> 44:39.420]  Casper mattresses cost just 500 for a twin, so you know, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[44:39.420 --> 44:47.020]  100 bucks casper mattresses cost just 500 for a twin 600 for a twin xl 750 for full 850 for queen in just 950 bucks
[44:47.020 --> 44:49.340]  under a thousand dollars for a king
[44:50.140 --> 44:53.340]  And these mattresses are made in america
[44:53.900 --> 44:58.140]  Pretty sure it's still true. If you live in new york city, you can get them delivered. They come to you on bicycle
[44:58.220 --> 45:00.540]  That's how small the box is some some poor sap
[45:01.260 --> 45:07.020]  Uh on a bike straps it to his back and delivers it to your house pretty cool thing if you think about it
[45:07.020 --> 45:13.420]  That's how small the mattress is a mattress on a back. Um, so go check them out. They have a new dog mattress, too
[45:13.820 --> 45:17.900]  Uh, the the the offer code doesn't work for the dog mattress. Alas
[45:18.540 --> 45:21.900]  But trust me, uh, i've had a couple of readers who bought this dog mattress
[45:22.540 --> 45:27.740]  Uh, and and they all said that their dogs love it that this is like the best thing they ever bought from a podcast
[45:27.820 --> 45:29.820]  So go check it out casper.com
[45:30.380 --> 45:33.660]  The talk show and remember that code the talk show to save 50 bucks
[45:33.660 --> 45:36.300]  on any human mattress
[45:36.700 --> 45:38.700]  But your dog deserves the best anyway
[45:42.300 --> 45:46.700]  He gets the best, uh, does your dog sleep like in the same spot all the time
[45:47.900 --> 45:52.620]  No, um, he has a he has an old futon on the floor that um,
[45:52.780 --> 45:55.820]  He sleeps on that he's supposed to sleep on but half the time he's up on the bed
[45:56.700 --> 45:58.940]  My childhood dog chester
[45:58.940 --> 46:02.620]  Yeah, I love that dog god damn I love that talk he was a mean little little uh,
[46:03.740 --> 46:05.740]  Like a poodle
[46:06.540 --> 46:08.960]  Mix I forget what he was mixed with I think like a pecanese
[46:09.660 --> 46:11.980]  I think he was okay. He was somewhere. It was a
[46:12.700 --> 46:18.300]  We got him. They're mean pecanese are mean karen. My wife had pecanese growing up and yeah, they would just as soon bite
[46:18.300 --> 46:19.820]  Yes, look at yeah
[46:19.820 --> 46:24.700]  Oh, yeah, he bit me a couple times, but I deserved it. I was teasing him. So, you know, I mean fair's fair
[46:24.780 --> 46:26.940]  I love that dog, but i'll tell you what we got a dog
[46:26.940 --> 46:31.340]  Fair, I love that dog, but i'll tell you what we you couldn't tell him where to sleep. I mean
[46:33.420 --> 46:38.540]  I think the surest way to make sure he didn't sleep on a dog mattress would have been to buy him a dog mattress
[46:44.060 --> 46:49.980]  So other max, yeah, so this is where everybody seems to be fuzzy is uh,
[46:51.740 --> 46:53.740]  What else are they going to announce so the mac
[46:53.740 --> 46:56.460]  Pro is hasn't been updated
[46:56.780 --> 46:58.780]  So the last update according to mac rumors
[46:59.420 --> 47:03.420]  was uh, july of 1998
[47:05.020 --> 47:10.940]  Was the last time that the mac pro was updated so it has been when it was when it was called the um,
[47:11.900 --> 47:14.380]  The power mac 18 years
[47:14.380 --> 47:21.020]  And counting then it's unchanged in 18 years now that is unusually long for the mac pro
[47:21.580 --> 47:22.860]  I think I have that one
[47:22.860 --> 47:25.420]  I I would say most people would agree
[47:26.060 --> 47:32.540]  That the mac pro is due for an update. It was blue right? It was the blue one. Yeah. Um,
[47:34.300 --> 47:37.340]  There are no rumors of a mac pro update
[47:38.940 --> 47:39.980]  But
[47:39.980 --> 47:45.020]  The mac pro is famously it's it made in america or manufactured in america
[47:45.580 --> 47:50.060]  So it's a completely different supply chain. So any you know, and I I can't help but think that it must be
[47:50.620 --> 47:52.620]  Churning out like five of them a quarter now
[47:54.300 --> 47:56.860]  Very busy, it's a very busy operation
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.660]  It's like the easiest job in the entire
[48:02.620 --> 48:04.620]  Easiest job in the entire company one guy
[48:04.620 --> 48:09.180]  Imagine if it's fully stocked up. There's all the soldering himself. It's just
[48:10.300 --> 48:14.640]  Worn grooves on the desk from where his feet go up every day
[48:20.700 --> 48:22.700]  He's all caught up on westworld
[48:24.060 --> 48:26.060]  Imagine then the phone rings
[48:27.660 --> 48:29.660]  It's tim cook what
[48:29.660 --> 48:35.500]  It's an update. Oh no, and all of a sudden as the phone rings he hears like a truck backing up
[48:36.380 --> 48:38.380]  with parts
[48:38.380 --> 48:40.380]  It's all over
[48:41.340 --> 48:47.100]  Uh, I would not be surprised I have absolutely no inside info. Nobody has said a damn word to me
[48:47.740 --> 48:54.460]  About any mac pros. I just common sense says to me that they've either got to update it soon or they've got to just
[48:54.460 --> 49:00.700]  Officially say, you know, we're not making it anymore. We're not making it anymore. Yeah, but it just seems on you
[49:00.700 --> 49:03.660]  It just seems like they need to have this device
[49:04.380 --> 49:06.380]  In my opinion. Yeah
[49:07.340 --> 49:12.460]  Although how many I mean they like, you know, they don't probably don't sell that many they're crazy expensive
[49:13.580 --> 49:17.900]  And they come with their own quirks, but that they're great looking device
[49:17.900 --> 49:24.780]  But but I still think that they really want to own or not own i'm not saying that they own it
[49:24.780 --> 49:27.660]  So but they want to be known as the leading
[49:28.300 --> 49:30.780]  computer maker for the quote-unquote pro
[49:31.500 --> 49:37.820]  Industry whether it's professional video people people who are you know, editing movies people who are
[49:39.580 --> 49:43.980]  Professional photographers who are working with just a lot of people
[49:43.980 --> 49:47.500]  Professional photographers who are working with you know
[49:48.380 --> 49:51.020]  50 gigabyte raw files, you know
[49:52.620 --> 49:57.420]  Wherever you you know, whatever the problem developers, of course, you know, I think even for their own use
[49:57.980 --> 50:03.420]  It's a useful device. I mean the iMac is pretty fast and has a nice display, but you know, it's
[50:04.220 --> 50:09.980]  Developing software is still one of those things where having a the fastest CPU possible can definitely make you know
[50:09.980 --> 50:14.300]  Your daily day-to-day life better. So yeah, I don't think that they
[50:15.260 --> 50:21.020]  It just seems unusual for me and I don't think they need to ever touch the industrial design again
[50:21.020 --> 50:26.460]  I mean, I shouldn't say ever but you know a macbook a mac pro that looks exactly like the black
[50:27.660 --> 50:34.140]  cylindrical thing that we know but just has a new GPU and CPU, uh, and
[50:34.140 --> 50:39.180]  You know all these modern ports like USB-C and and etc. Etc. Uh,
[50:39.740 --> 50:44.300]  Just seems like something Apple should sell so I wouldn't be surprised at all if they have it ready to go on Thursday and we
[50:44.380 --> 50:48.220]  Just haven't heard about it because they were able to keep it secret because it's not
[50:48.860 --> 50:52.620]  Going through the Asian supply chain that looks like a sieve, right?
[50:53.900 --> 50:57.740]  Yeah, well, I think I think it would be nice. I mean, I hope they don't I I don't know
[50:57.740 --> 51:00.860]  I'm not in the market for one. I'll probably I'm never gonna be in the market for one but
[51:00.860 --> 51:05.020]  I I agree with that sentiment that it seems like the kind of thing that they should
[51:05.660 --> 51:09.340]  Keep making is sort of a even if it's just like a putting a flag in the ground
[51:11.100 --> 51:13.820]  I think there's some speculation that people who
[51:15.580 --> 51:22.860]  Follow these Intel chipsets, you know that maybe the timing isn't really quite right for a new mac pro because like the
[51:23.500 --> 51:27.820]  last update to the Xeon line of pros and CPUs was you know, like
[51:27.820 --> 51:31.900]  May or something like that. So you'd think that maybe if they were going to do it they would have done it in june
[51:33.020 --> 51:36.940]  And now they're sort of like only just a few months away from like the next one
[51:36.940 --> 51:39.340]  What's called like gravy train or something like that?
[51:39.980 --> 51:45.340]  I don't think apple is all that I I think at this point when they've gone this far between updates to mac pros
[51:45.340 --> 51:49.580]  I I think if they're six months late on the latest Xeon processors
[51:50.380 --> 51:52.380]  So what?
[51:52.780 --> 51:55.260]  Right, I don't know that they're I don't know if they're
[51:55.260 --> 52:00.620]  Looking at keeping the mac pro within a couple of weeks of the Intel cutting edge. Yeah
[52:02.220 --> 52:07.420]  I don't know. What do you think? Well, I mean, I I think if you it depends on what else you're announcing with it
[52:07.420 --> 52:10.060]  maybe and and if they're announcing it with an
[52:10.620 --> 52:12.620]  with new monitors, then maybe that
[52:13.900 --> 52:20.460]  Becomes the bigger story than whatever processor is in it. That's exactly where I was heading. John
[52:20.460 --> 52:26.380]  So maybe the reason that they haven't updated the mac pro in such an absurdly long time
[52:26.780 --> 52:31.260]  Is that they really wanted the quote-unquote next mac pro to work with the next?
[52:32.780 --> 52:38.620]  Apple cinema display apple hasn't even sold a display since june since they discontinued the non-retina whatever they called it
[52:40.060 --> 52:46.940]  Another conspicuous absence from the apple product lineup is a retina pro display
[52:46.940 --> 52:50.060]  Whatever they want to call it, you know cinema display
[52:50.620 --> 52:52.060]  5k whatever
[52:52.060 --> 52:58.620]  but you know something like the big iMac display with retina resolution and the
[52:58.940 --> 53:00.940]  the high color gamut range
[53:01.100 --> 53:02.780]  and a
[53:02.780 --> 53:06.940]  Simple it just works just plug this thing into your mac and you you know
[53:06.940 --> 53:12.940]  You don't have to worry about plugging two or three cables in because you need two graphics cards and it's stitched together or whatever
[53:12.940 --> 53:17.900]  Just solve all the problems of the bandwidth of driving the 5k retina display
[53:18.220 --> 53:24.460]  You worry about it apple. Just give me a simple thing to plug in so maybe they were waiting for that and maybe they thought
[53:25.260 --> 53:30.460]  Previously that maybe they'd have something like that ready earlier, but it all kind of needs to come together
[53:30.460 --> 53:36.700]  It seems to me like some of this stuff is a it all needs to come at once and that sort of has maybe
[53:37.020 --> 53:39.420]  Been the main cause of this unusual
[53:39.420 --> 53:43.340]  Dirth of mac updates hardware updates. Yeah
[53:44.620 --> 53:51.340]  That they kind of want to move to this world where there's USB-C ports that do thunderbolt and that can be connected to a 5k cinema display
[53:52.300 --> 53:54.300]  But it all kind of needs to come at once
[53:55.180 --> 53:57.180]  Maybe yeah
[53:57.180 --> 54:00.300]  So I can see that it seems like I mean that's kind of their thing, right?
[54:00.300 --> 54:04.940]  I mean they don't where other companies are happy to introduce a technology
[54:04.940 --> 54:09.820]  And say hey now we have this. Okay. Yeah, you have that but it doesn't work with everything else
[54:11.020 --> 54:16.540]  Apple wants to make sure that everything works, you know, at least, you know in general works better together
[54:17.180 --> 54:19.820]  And creates and and creates a story
[54:21.180 --> 54:25.260]  That makes that tries to make that whole package compelling, right?
[54:25.980 --> 54:28.380]  So so I think there's definitely
[54:29.020 --> 54:31.020]  Something to that argument. It's a
[54:31.020 --> 54:37.420]  So I think there's definitely something to that argument. It's also the case. I know a ton of people
[54:38.140 --> 54:40.140]  who connect their
[54:41.020 --> 54:44.860]  macbook pros to a display at their desk and that they
[54:45.500 --> 54:47.660]  They're you know, so that like at work
[54:48.700 --> 54:50.780]  Uh, you have a nice big display in front of you
[54:51.180 --> 54:54.300]  Maybe two displays if you keep your macbook open on the side
[54:54.780 --> 54:59.420]  You could do it either way and then at the end of the day you can just disconnect the thing and take the macbook
[54:59.420 --> 55:03.580]  Book pro home with you and you just have the macbook pro. I know a ton of people who work like that
[55:03.740 --> 55:06.300]  I know that here in philly my friends at happy cog
[55:06.860 --> 55:13.420]  A great web development studio or web design studio. They redesigned their whole office around that concept. They just everybody's desk
[55:14.060 --> 55:19.420]  All they have at their desk is a display and then everybody everybody gets a macbook pro
[55:20.140 --> 55:23.340]  And that's how everybody works. You don't even have to sit at the same spot every day
[55:23.340 --> 55:30.620]  You can just you know, just walk up to any open display and plug it in and you get power and a display. Um,
[55:31.180 --> 55:35.660]  Nobody wants nobody wants designers don't want to work with non-retina displays anymore
[55:36.380 --> 55:41.500]  I mean it actually is actually like hard you you can't design retina graphics without a retina display
[55:41.580 --> 55:43.580]  I mean it's you know and developers, you know
[55:43.580 --> 55:47.660]  I know that they were talking about an atp this week where casey lis was talking about how
[55:47.660 --> 55:54.380]  He's trying to design a retina iphone app on a non-retina display and you end up then you like run the app on your phone
[55:54.380 --> 55:58.380]  And you realize there's all these graphics that are missing because you couldn't even see them on your display, you know
[55:59.820 --> 56:05.500]  You really it's it's you know, you can do it technically in the same way that you you could
[56:06.140 --> 56:08.220]  You could do an illustration with your eyes closed
[56:09.020 --> 56:11.820]  Right just it just may not turn out right
[56:11.820 --> 56:16.860]  Like you don't have to wear your glasses, yeah, you can just take a guess as to whether it's in focus
[56:19.100 --> 56:23.260]  And again, they'll be they'll be uh crazy if they if they do come they'll be crazy expensive
[56:23.820 --> 56:28.460]  Oh, I well, I don't know about that. I mean, I think well, I don't know they're too way too expensive
[56:28.460 --> 56:34.620]  I mean, I I will not be buying one. What what does what does the retina 5k i max start at?
[56:35.340 --> 56:36.380]  Let's see
[56:36.380 --> 56:38.300]  Is that like 1500?
[56:38.300 --> 56:43.420]  Let's see. Is that like fifteen hundred dollars? That sounds exactly what I was gonna say fifteen hundred bucks
[56:43.980 --> 56:50.940]  27 inch iMac with retina 5k display. Well, no, it's a little bit more expensive that starts at eight hundred dollars. Okay
[56:52.140 --> 56:58.380]  I I would think that they could sell that display without the computer inside for I don't know maybe twelve hundred dollars
[56:59.340 --> 57:00.460]  I don't know
[57:00.460 --> 57:04.700]  I knew but the old apple 27 inch display was 999 and
[57:04.700 --> 57:08.540]  It was kind of ridiculous about the end of its life that they were still selling it at 999
[57:08.860 --> 57:15.740]  like that is part of what makes this laughable is I understand why apple sets a price and then keeps the price for the entire
[57:15.820 --> 57:18.300]  Product lifetime as opposed to dell which sort of
[57:19.180 --> 57:24.560]  dell's computers are sort of like the stock market where they get reprised every day based on you know, current fluctuations
[57:25.580 --> 57:27.500]  It's true though. It really is it's
[57:28.460 --> 57:29.660]  It's like you can come you know
[57:29.660 --> 57:33.420]  I mean you can configure the exact same machine at dell like a week later and it's you know
[57:33.420 --> 57:37.100]  it's more like buying an airplane ticket like well if the planes filled up
[57:37.900 --> 57:41.420]  and lots of sales from other like the the um, when I
[57:41.500 --> 57:47.260]  I bought my my kid a pc laptop a few couple years ago for christmas and and yeah
[57:47.340 --> 57:52.140]  Like navigating that whole thing like well, it's you know, normally placed with this but this you know, you get this new coupon sale
[57:52.140 --> 57:54.140]  Oh, yeah. Okay, great
[57:55.500 --> 57:58.300]  So I got you know, I got what you know, it's you know, it's
[57:58.300 --> 58:04.620]  Ostensibly the price was like 850 and I got it for 750 or something like that. I mean, it's like apple would never do that
[58:07.580 --> 58:11.980]  You got a coupon on a retina display
[58:15.100 --> 58:17.100]  Type in this code at the end
[58:20.140 --> 58:24.780]  Uh, I don't know if I should tell this story or not. I guess I will I'll tell you it was one of the worst things
[58:24.780 --> 58:28.780]  It was one of the worst things I ever worst I ever felt about myself in my life
[58:29.420 --> 58:31.420]  I was in college
[58:32.540 --> 58:37.020]  And it was the middle of the day and there's I forget I can't I think of
[58:37.820 --> 58:41.020]  I actually forget forget the name of the student union even though I spent like
[58:41.420 --> 58:44.620]  10 hours a day in the building because it was where the school newspaper was
[58:45.260 --> 58:49.260]  Um, and I was going in and out of the building for reasons that I no longer remember
[58:49.260 --> 58:50.860]  But it was some kind of task
[58:50.860 --> 58:55.420]  it was like for maybe like first day of a new semester and there was something me and another
[58:55.660 --> 58:59.260]  colleague from the student newspaper at drexel were doing where it required us to
[58:59.980 --> 59:01.980]  Keep going back in and out of the building
[59:02.300 --> 59:04.300]  Middle of the afternoon nice sunny day
[59:04.860 --> 59:10.460]  And there's some kid also a college kid who obviously had been taking a job from somebody to hand out
[59:11.100 --> 59:13.580]  A little some kind of flyer to kids coming in
[59:14.780 --> 59:15.900]  and
[59:15.900 --> 59:21.260]  We weren't coming in like every minute or so. It was maybe like every 20 minutes or so and every time we went by he
[59:21.660 --> 59:24.300]  Would offer them to us as though he'd never seen us again
[59:24.620 --> 59:28.940]  And then there's this moment of recognition and it's like oh you guys again and do it
[59:30.620 --> 59:38.320]  And after like the seventh time and he did it again and he was almost like apologetic he I said well are these coupons are coupons
[59:38.320 --> 59:44.880]  And he said they're they're coupons. And I said, well, I only take coupons and
[59:46.800 --> 59:52.720]  My friend who I was with almost died of laughter and he said I can't believe that guy didn't just punch you and I was
[59:52.720 --> 59:54.720]  Like, you know, he probably should have
[59:55.360 --> 59:56.720]  Is that?
[59:56.720 --> 59:59.360]  It was just it was uncalled for it was totally uncalled for
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.840]  And at the time I was I amused myself to death with that but i'm a changed man. I've grown up
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:12.160]  I no longer see others. Well, I just I do see it as funny, but I no longer see it as something that I would actually say
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:21.840]  It is definitely funny and and and the you know college I mean I yeah i'm well i'm not i'm not going over the things
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.200]  That I said in college. Well, the funny thing I remember was that when I said it
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.760]  I didn't expect him to give me an answer. I expected him when I said are they coupons or coupons?
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.320]  I expected him to give me the finger at that point
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:39.760]  He didn't even hesitate. He didn't even hesitate. He said they're coupons. I even remember that he said they're he said coupons instead of coupons
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.440]  And I just said well, I only accept coupons
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.920]  I don't know what I don't know something about that. I haven't thought about that story. Yeah, if that guy's listening, um, you know
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.720]  Contact john
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.720]  And i'll send you a free darren fireball t-shirt
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.520]  I swear to god
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.400]  I I haven't thought about that story in 20 years
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.080]  So I just sent you a link this happened while we were uh, oh recording
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:09.980]  um
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.960]  apparently
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.000]  pictures of the of the of the bar leaked in sierra
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  Of the retina macbook
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.580]  Images of new macbook pro with magic toolbar leaked in macos sierra 10.12.1
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.580]  Sierra 10.12.1
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:34.200]  Way to go apple includes apple pay so there is a like a fingerprint
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.780]  Sensor, uh, I also see that they've printed a mac rumors logo on the return key
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.340]  I saw that I thought that must be then now they're doing um, uh some co-branding I guess
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.340]  Yes
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.180]  This is
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.380]  This has got to drive phil schiller nuts. Oh my god. Yeah, right. How did they do that? I mean I where we
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:02.340]  I guess this was in the help
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.420]  I guess for 10.12.1. That's like i'll put the everybody by the time they hear it will probably have seen it
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.140]  But I will yeah, everyone's probably putting a link into the show notes. We you know, that's nice that we talked about
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.740]  Before I noticed that way to go apple
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.780]  Couldn't you do it like 15 minutes earlier? I guess they yes, they did but nobody noticed it
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.460]  Um, well that brings us
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.260]  That brings us to the next question I was going to have
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.220]  Which is that uh, I did have it in the notes
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:37.220]  Which is that it has been rumored and it does make some sort of you know
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.820]  Simple sense that they were going to put touch id on the new macbooks
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.180]  My question was where is it going to go?
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:48.180]  Like the just the basic idea of having touch id on a macbook
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.500]  Yeah, sure. That sounds it makes a lot of sense
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.060]  Especially once you get used to it on a phone you realize how nice it is
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:59.140]  But where would it go on a on a macbook would it go on the trackpad? Would it go on?
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700]  like the j key would it
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:08.660]  Go and it looks like you know, the answer is they're putting it up in this uh upper right corner of the magic
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:13.620]  Toolbar, yeah, and my other thought is even if with this magic toolbar, uh
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:19.140]  Would they put it in a corner or put it in the middle because it seems like by putting it in
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:24.260]  Is it going to be on both corners? It doesn't seem like a waste of components to put two in
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:31.060]  But on the other hand isn't it oddly biased towards right-handed users by putting it in the upper right corner
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.820]  Or am I overthinking those I think maybe you're overthinking it. I mean
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:39.300]  You know unlocking with my you know unlock i'm assuming it the computer unlocks with it, too
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.100]  um, but unlocking and paying with my left
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820]  index finger would be
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:51.860]  Not really onerous either and as a right as a right-hander. Yeah, but but but I would guess that it's it's um,
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.220]  It's configurable because I mean that's the whole point of the thing, right?
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.500]  Yeah, but the whole thing can't be a touch id sensor, right? I mean, I suppose not I suppose not
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:06.580]  Yeah, it would seem unnecessarily. I mean, I guess it could be but it seems like that would be way or you two one in each corner
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.540]  but
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:12.820]  Right, it just seems like a waste too and I guess I guess the power button's always been on the upper right corner
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:19.300]  So, you know seems like left-handed macbook users have been able to turn their computers on and off for a while
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.540]  So maybe i'm overthinking that
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:27.940]  Maybe i'm over sensitive to my left-handed friends. Well, I mean, maybe I'm over sensitive to my left-handed friends
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.100]  Are my left-handed friends. Well, I mean, maybe they sell different models of lefty and a righty
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.100]  Like buying golf clubs, I mean they're already they're already selling models that have mac rumors on the return key
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.100]  Like golf clubs and scissors you can buy a left-handed macbook prop
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.980]  At the left door you have to go to the left orem though, do you know what bothers me about this shot really?
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:57.060]  It does and it's it's i'm showing my age and I gotta just get used to it. But uh, I look at this
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.060]  there's a picture of
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:03.780]  It's it's showing I guess it's from like you said it's from the help of of how to use apple pay
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:09.940]  So somebody is making an apple pay purchase the touch screen the little strip has a cancel button on the left
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.740]  Then it says apple pay and then something in red that I I can't read but i'm guessing it
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.620]  And it says touch here. Yeah touch here
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.300]  To pay apple's 900 and of course, it's going to 326 bucks, right?
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.260]  What can you get from apple for 326 but then you can you can also see what's on the display?
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.380]  Yeah, no, no, they're buying beats. Oh, it's headphones headphones
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:37.240]  Um, you can also see what's on the display and they're using safari to buy something from apple.com
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.860]  What bothers me is that they're running it. They're running this mac with the menu bar hidden
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.060]  I really it really bothers full
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.220]  Full screen full screen mode bothers you. Yeah
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.660]  Yeah
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.020]  It does
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:06:00.020]  I think you're gonna I think you're gonna say doesn't the doesn't the um, the apple pay sheet look like it's um, it's not
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.340]  connected
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.860]  Well, it doesn't
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:08.900]  Maybe maybe it's okay. It almost looks like it's square. It's not um that the uh perspective
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:13.460]  The perspective is off. Yeah, maybe like yeah, sort of
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.740]  Uh, so anyway, I guess we're getting a touch
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.780]  touch strip
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.780]  I'm glad we settled that. Yeah
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:23.920]  Uh
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.020]  Presumably if it is oled they're saying it mac rumors is saying it as fact that it's an oled touch panel
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.100]  Which you certainly can't tell from the image
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.700]  but it does make some sense that it's oled and not lcd because
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:41.300]  It's going to be black most of the time or the background is going to be black all the time and oled does
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.500]  much blacker blacks than lcd
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:49.700]  And it's like I think the colors are still messed up on oled, but you certainly can't complain about the blacks
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:58.340]  This is and they also say, um a new macbook air model well the same rumor I guess yeah
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.580]  Uh, well, there's that
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.020]  So they say they say new iMacs are a possibility as well
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:13.700]  I think that I think that's true just because I think that the iMac is still sort of
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.580]  The you know, it's the the default desktop computer
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:23.380]  I mean, it's obviously not the mac bro or the mac mini mac mini hasn't been updated in two years
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.980]  So why not? Uh, you know, it's been a year. It was october last year
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.980]  Why not just you know, just do a silent or not silent, but you know
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:35.460]  You know just take the latest and greatest from intel and and stick it in the gut
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.740]  I can't see why they wouldn't do that
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.900]  Yeah
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.860]  Yeah, I don't know why either I mean, but I don't
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.180]  I'm, not sure why they haven't updated the
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:51.540]  The mac pro and the mac mini for right several years. All right, so
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.700]  Wrapping up. I think that we will see the new mac pros
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.940]  I think
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.180]  We don't know what the hell they're doing with this quote-unquote 13-inch other model
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.940]  Doesn't make any sense to us can't wait to find out about that one. Yeah, um
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.780]  Yeah, um
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.500]  I i'm, I don't know if I bet on new mac pros
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.700]  But because it seems to me like you could lose a lot of money over the last
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.980]  Three years by betting on new mac pros
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:25.460]  But I would at least like to see new mac pros and it seems like maybe they if they've been waiting for a retina display
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.660]  Maybe the time is right and that if we see one we'll see both
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:32.020]  Well, then does it seem like I mean i'm not sure that these
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:38.260]  Is just updating the laptop line doesn't sound like enough for an event, does it?
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:44.100]  I don't think so either. I mean we can continue with that after the sponsor break that maybe there's other stuff
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.860]  They could announce other than mac hardware
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.740]  But it does seem to me like if it was really just if the only thing that was really new new
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.820]  Like this is a new design new is the macbook pros. I don't know that they would have an event
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.820]  Right
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:02.500]  So, I don't know. I mean we certainly know everything, you know, sierra is already out. It's not like you know
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.620]  It's not like they have a new operating system to show. Yeah
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.700]  um, I mean the only other thing that well, okay you want to do a
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.460]  What you're going to say like well do the air pods? I mean that they would announce that air pods are shipping
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.900]  Yeah, but that's nothing just for sale. They can't take time in an event for that
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.860]  I'm, i'm guessing that that's when they're going to say that because they did say late october
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.660]  And this event will be on the 27th of october. So
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:34.660]  So i'm hopeful I hope we are going to see mac pros we'll see i'm not going to bet the house on it, uh
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.740]  I I
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:42.340]  Would definitely not be surprised to see that we have updated iMacs that look exactly the same but just have updated components
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.380]  I mean, there's no point to update it updating the the display
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.820]  Right. Yeah. I mean the displays already that doesn't that doesn't make any sense, right?
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.580]  It's already got the high color gamut and all the pixels you'd want. Uh,
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:00.260]  And then there's I guess the only thing left is the mac mini which I don't think they're gonna I I don't I
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.140]  I don't know. I think that that might be like, uh
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.300]  done
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:11.140]  You think that oh you really? I don't know or maybe it's sort of on a permanent three or four year schedule. I don't know
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.980]  I just wouldn't be surprised if you know, I did the event comes and goes and there's no news about the mac mini
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.900]  I just wish that they would just you know, stick new processors in them. I mean
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.860]  I do too. Don't you don't have to change it that much just put some new processors in it and then
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:33.060]  I don't know. It's all it seems like that's not that hard and you're kind of printing money doing it
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.500]  and
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.220]  Well, apple's a very small company. I think that you know
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.100]  I don't know that they have the
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:44.180]  The bandwidth, you know the internal bandwidth to update
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.300]  Update a computer that doesn't even have a display or anything
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.700]  I would like to see them update the mac mini. I would like to see them keep it updated
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:58.900]  I think the mac mini is an interesting little device where yes in many cases. It's just the lowest price apple
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:06.580]  Official mac that you can buy without, you know, building your own hackintosh thing and it is just somebody trying to build the cheapest desktop
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.340]  Mac that they can get away with or you know, and and you know
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:17.060]  sensibly reuse existing things like the display that they've already got that's if you have a perfectly fine display, you know
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.780]  That this is a perfectly fine low-cost mac
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.540]  But it's also a device and i'm sure that like, you know
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.460]  people who listen to my podcasts
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:31.060]  Are among there where it's in some ways it kind of is a power user device because it's the sort of thing that people who would
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:37.380]  Set up like a media server in their house would do right where it's not like your power user where you're spending a lot of money
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:42.580]  On it, but where you're doing things that most typical consumers would never even think to do
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.700]  Right, like, you know or build like your own, you know people I know
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:53.860]  You know people who who sort of rather than buy an apple tv will you know buy a mac mini and sort of you know?
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.020]  Select their own software that they can use to drive their home entertainment system
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.580]  Yeah, so that maybe they can watch movies that fell off a truck and stuff like that
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.020]  You know, I mean there's certain things that you can do if you just have
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.820]  A pc that you control connected to your tv that you couldn't do. So there are power user
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.900]  Use cases for the mac mini and I
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:20.740]  Always, you know, I like to think of apple as a company that makes things that people like that would like to buy
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.860]  So I would like to see it but i'm not holding my breath for it
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:29.460]  But maybe you know, maybe just like in the one fell swoop now everybody's like, oh, yeah
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.940]  You know, maybe just like in the one fell swoop now everything uses usbc
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.860]  You know, maybe they update the mac mini too just to get usbc ports on
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:44.180]  Yeah, I wish I would like them to do that too. I I would consider buying one. I've never owned one
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.660]  well, actually, I mean I have an old one that somebody gave me but um,
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.380]  I've never purchased one
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.740]  and
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:54.340]  I feel like I might be in the market for one like if I if I go to
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:13:00.180]  which i'm kind of leaning towards right now is getting a macbook pro again, um, you know, I just
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:08.180]  The i that iMac upstairs and that that ancient macbook pro aren't going to last long either so and I mostly just need the need
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.980]  A server like a media server and so I would definitely consider getting
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.020]  A mini for that
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.880]  All right, let me take a break and thank our next sponsor it's our good friends at audible.com
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.800]  audible.com
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.280]  audible.com has an unmatched selection of audiobooks and
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.600]  This is how I used to think I used to think of audible as a place where you go to get audio books
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.640]  Um, but they have much more than that now
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.600]  They have tons of original audio shows including news comedy and more
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.120]  It is in some ways sort of like netflix for audio
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:49.080]  It really is they've got an amazing selection of stuff and you can get a 30-day
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.840]  free trial
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.840]  by going to audible.com
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.880]  talk show
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:14:01.480]  If you want to listen to it audible has it they have audiobooks from virtually every genre you can imagine anytime anywhere
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.880]  And audiobooks have been around for a while. I mean I used to call them books on tape
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.600]  I mean that's how long I mean that i've been familiar with them
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.400]  but it's just one of those things that has exploded in popularity with digital because
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.920]  Uh, you know tapes are a little bit of a pain in the ass
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:23.160]  And digital, you know, you could skip around you can have stuff read at a different speed and the book industry has really
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.200]  Embraced it. It's no longer an afterthought. Um
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:33.400]  A whole bunch of popular books are read by the authors themselves, which adds a totally extra dimension to the text
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:41.720]  Just a really cool idea if you think about it, uh, or else well, otherwise it they're often, uh read by like, you know
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.120]  Famous actors and actresses and stuff like that people with really great voices. Um,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.040]  and
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:54.760]  audible.com makes it easy to take risks and try new authors and and genres without regret because they offer what they call their
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:01.560]  Great listen guarantee if you start an audiobook and you don't like it you can exchange it for another one for free
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.000]  See and listen for yourself when you begin your free 30-day trial you get your first audiobook for free

[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.880]  it's a great sponsor for podcasts because they know it is why they sponsor podcasts because if you're listening to me tell you about
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:23.720]  audible.com by definition you obviously listen to spoken word content and
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:31.480]  Therefore you're in you know, right there in the target audience for them. I I would I would wager that there's a higher percentage of talk show listeners
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.440]  Who listen to podcasts then there are
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:41.960]  Who sleep on mattresses? It's probably a better fit even than casper have you know, like because some number of you probably just sleep on the floor
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.240]  But if you're listening to me, I guarantee you you listen to podcasts
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.440]  So if you have more time to fill with more audible content audio content go to audible.com
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.080]  talk show and get your
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.480]  Free sponsorship my thanks to them for sponsoring this show
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.600]  What do you think you think there's a higher percentage of talk show listeners who who listen to podcasts?
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:05.480]  talk show listeners who who listen to podcasts or who sleep on a mattress
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:15.080]  I think it's got to be it's got to be listened listen to uh podcast. I think I think what could
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.040]  Could skew it or what? Do you know what your numbers are in japan?
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.520]  No, I don't but it's non-zero right right, right
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.160]  Uh-huh. It's non-zero
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.400]  So I think as much as I could throw the whole thing off god bless casper
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.360]  I love him and I think it's a great fit because almost everybody sleeps on a mattress and needs a new one eventually
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  audible, I think might be the the
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.360]  Greatest fit for the podcast audience of all time because by definition everybody everybody listens to audio
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.320]  I mean in theory somebody I don't have transcripts every week
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.840]  So I mean in theory somebody could rig something up where they're making their own transcripts of the show and reading them
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.880]  But I I would guess that that number is smaller than the number of people who don't have a mattress
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.880]  Mm-hmm
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:03.720]  They do transcripts of your show for when you do the live one. Uh, I do. Yeah. Well, yeah, or somebody does it
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.720]  Did that does that was that uh?
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.720]  uh
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.920]  Yes
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:15.400]  This time yeah serenity caldwell typed it up in exchange for their being allowed to publish it
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.280]  Which was a good deal for you know, I thought that was a fun deal. Yeah
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160]  And I also pay
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.380]  uh vimeo
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:28.580]  For closed captions for those so that the video has closed captions
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:35.140]  And so I forget what it is a couple hundred. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it's a you know, it's like not it's you know
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.560]  Like it's it's not free, but it was it seemed like a no-brainer in terms of accessibility
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:46.980]  My twitter bio is um is actually from that transcript. Oh, really? Yeah, because I can't remember
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:49.060]  I can't remember what was said about me
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.380]  this last time
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.580]  But there was a mention of me and then they they typed in
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:59.700]  Serenity typed in the crowd reaction, which was laughter and some aahs
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.740]  So that's my
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:09.700]  That's my twitter bio. I think the context was there was my introduction. I said last year we had phil shiller and and you know
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.700]  It was it was yeah, I think it was less than charitable if I remember
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.380]  This you know the goal, you know, it would be nice to be able to top it but one of these years
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:25.220]  Is it we're gonna run out of room to top it and you know, it's just gonna open the curtains and it's gonna be molds
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.060]  This year is not that year I think that was it I think that was pretty close to what I said
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:38.820]  It was nice enough. I mean it was heartfelt. I mean I meant it
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:45.780]  That someday they're gonna have to put up with me yeah, and we're gonna we're gonna have a good show yeah, yeah
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.020]  Look forward to that
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.020]  I'm interested to know what um
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.500]  I'm assuming that this magic
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.220]  What the hell is it called? Magic?
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.100]  What do they call it toolbar magic toolbar toolbar?
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:02.340]  Defaults to just function keys when there's no other
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.700]  Thing presented. Yeah, nothing else that's been deliberately programmed. Yes
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:09.220]  Yeah
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.340]  Yeah, because uh because owen williams, uh
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:14.820]  Uh
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:18.420]  I forget what he where he works now. He's jumped around a lot. Um was pointing out
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:23.140]  There's you know, like if you look at it, there's like there's no escape key. Like that's the one thing that you
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.980]  On that's on the toolbar that you would probably use. Um in a regular application
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.020]  And like I think of like minecraft
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:36.660]  Like there's no escape key. You can't play the game, but there must be it must just default to
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.720]  What's normally there if it's not specifically?
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.340]  I it's defined
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.540]  I even in my days when I was
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:50.340]  Telnetting into things to do my computer science assignments in the 90s
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.820]  On unix machines. I've always been a bb edit user
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:02.340]  But I I had to know if you can't you can't go through the old terminal and not eventually learn either emacs or vim to some
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.100]  degree, um
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:04.980]  and
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:09.780]  Vim is effectively unused. I mean, I don't think apple is all that concerned about people using vim in a terminal
[01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:14.260]  But it's it you you hit the escape key roughly 700 times a minute
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:20.740]  It's like escape is how you do anything escape is like enter a command escape is switch modes. It's it
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:22.020]  You know
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:27.940]  I just remember when somebody pointed it out with the smart keypad cover for the ipad that it doesn't have an escape key
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.660]  And somebody was like, well, how would you use vim and it's like
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:37.060]  I kind of do wish that they had put the escape. I use the escape key just to cancel things, you know, yeah
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.980]  so
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:44.180]  I do wish they had an escape key, but I don't know that it's I don't know that vim users are on the front of
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.180]  apple's mind
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.020]  Probably not does seem weird for the mac though
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:53.540]  It seems it seemed because at least with the ipad you could argue that there's no history of it because the software keyboard
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.700]  for the ipad doesn't have an escape key either but
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.900]  It certainly seems unusual
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:06.420]  Our friend darth is um already has an image up with uh with the um
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:14.100]  The magic toolbar and it's um, it's like it's the time square, you know message thing and it's just rolling rolling across courage
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.260]  All right, i'll put a link to it in my share
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.580]  Guy is that guy's quite funny
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:33.060]  I said this before to me. He's like the funniest, uh,
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:39.380]  Like political cartoonist. Mm-hmm going today and he was like, oh shucks
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:48.020]  But it's not they're not obviously not traditional political cartoons, but they are political and they are funny and they do express
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.780]  Complex it's the modern. It's the modern equivalent, right? It's
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.820]  It's updated for the modern version of the game
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.980]  the modern equivalent right it's it's updated for the modern age
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.380]  darth's
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.300]  tiny-handed trump
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.300]  photoshop
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:11.700]  Like when he does one for trump, it doesn't matter whether he mentions the hands or not. He just always shrinks his hand
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.820]  And the funny part is is that darth is also
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.820]  uh
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:24.420]  He's I think he's really good at photoshop like yeah, or at least he's good at what he does in photoshop
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:28.420]  which isn't trying to fool you into thinking this is real, but it's like
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.180]  He must the goal. It's just like yeah
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:37.540]  And I think he does whip these things out in a minute or two. Oh my god. No, he's crazy fast, right?
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:43.220]  He's crazy fast, but they don't look like they would if I did it where you would know clearly see where the lasso was
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.380]  drawn around the hands, you know
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.340]  Like if I was doing it as quickly as he did you'd still see the marching ants around the selection
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.800]  I would just draw that and take a screenshot
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:03.460]  What about other stuff that apple might announce this week like, uh, they could do like
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:12.180]  The some like their airport stuff is out of date. Would they tie that together with their you know home stereo
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.260]  speaker
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.260]  amazon echo type thing
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:22.980]  Uh, that's a good question, I mean i've i've heard that thing is is out there and and being
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:28.340]  Field tested, um, I wasn't thinking that it was ready to go yet
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:34.420]  But I don't know but it seemed like I don't know either that would maybe help explain why they're having an event
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.460]  If they have something actually new to unveil
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:44.180]  Right. I mean and the timing, you know, the timing right before the holidays would be good right if they actually are able to make it
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.380]  I mean how they kept it from leaking who knows but you know
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.780]  Yeah, that's a good question made in the usa
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.420]  I don't know probably not maybe that guy's been doing more than we thought
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.460]  I don't know, but it's you know, I would like to see it. I don't know what else to say about it other than that
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:06.020]  You know seems like maybe
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:09.140]  My understanding my understanding was that it it was
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.300]  Uh, not that long ago that people were
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.540]  Given some units to try out
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.140]  So that doesn't seem like quite enough time like if they found like a real problem
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:28.100]  It doesn't seem like enough time to turn it around and and do something. I mean this seemed like like real alpha
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.060]  sort of stuff
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:35.700]  But I don't know but it seems like you know, even if it's a short event, it seems like they did
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.740]  Might have room for something like that. Yeah
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:47.300]  I linked to a thing. Have you seen this where there was like the widespread internet outage this week, you know, uh,
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:52.820]  I sort of slept right through it. But I mean, you know huge parts of the internet were unavailable
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.060]  It was during the morning on the east
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:01.940]  And and some of the afternoon. So yeah, it seems as though wherever, you know, wherever tearing fireball is hosted. Uh,
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:08.340]  Seemed to avoid it because I didn't seem to get any complaints that people couldn't reach during fireball, but a whole bunch of a whole bunch of
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:16.740]  Big internet sites were unavailable because uh, there was an attack on the dns system and when dns goes down pretty much everything goes down
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.420]  And the gist of though the attack which is interesting is that it was a bunch of like
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.140]  uh internet of things devices like like webcams and
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:32.660]  Just internet connected cameras and speakers and stuff like that made by these chinese companies that all
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:39.060]  All have like the same password the same password like literally like i'm not making making this attack up
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:45.380]  and that there's like a botnet that just just slowly but methodically searched the internet for like
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.260]  Are you one of these cameras?
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:53.220]  Nope, are you one of these cameras? Nope, but you know thousands and thousands and thousands of people
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:58.180]  Are you one of these cameras? Nope, you know thousands and thousands and thousands of times but then eventually
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.100]  Found a yes
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:06.740]  Right noted the address and then kept going and then when they wanted to turn on the attack just told all all of these cameras to
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:09.060]  to uh do a
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.180]  You know distributed denial of service attack on dns servers
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.180]  Anyway, it seems to me like a lot of these internet things of things devices aren't all that secure
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:25.620]  Apparently not and that may be you know, I just linked before the show started to a two-year or a year-old story about uh
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:33.780]  Device makers complaining that apple's homekit, you know homekit was slow to make peripherals for because apple has stringent
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.460]  security
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:36.820]  requirements
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.820]  And maybe that makes a lot more sense now
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.820]  Don't all use the same password
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:49.460]  Right, that's our stringent security requirement number one
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:56.580]  Uh breaking yeah, I mean I have a i've got i've you know, the only thing i've got is this one camera and I
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:01.140]  Don't think it's one of those but you know, I don't even know how to how I would tell
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.260]  If you come in your office and it attacks you. Yeah
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:08.180]  It was growling the other day, but I don't think
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.980]  I think that was unrelated. I don't know. I don't have any other things to expect on this event
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:14.980]  Uh, yeah, do you?
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:18.500]  It's probably not going to be that big, you know, I think you know, well, so yeah
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.860]  So this is this is happening at the campus at the smaller. Yes, it is at town hall. Yeah
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:28.180]  It will almost certainly be the last town hall event
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:35.780]  I mean barring some kind of surprise emergency event sort of like the antenna gate or something like that. I don't I don't see
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:41.620]  You know, I they even said at the last one that this would probably that the last one was probably going to be the last
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.620]  Will be going to be the last town hall
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.500]  Event. So this one I think is almost certainly
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.180]  Maybe they'll do you think that maybe they'll let us rip out the chairs?
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:01.940]  They did that at the I think it was at philadelphia's veteran stadium, uh, which is no longer there it's now a parking lot so
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:09.300]  Uh built in like 1971 the vat as we called it lovingly was the home of the philadelphia eagles and the philadelphia phillies for
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:13.780]  I don't know 20 something years, you know growing up we had I don't even remember where these came from
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:20.740]  But I know you mentioned that that we had a couple of bleacher seats, right? I mean not not not bench seats, but like wooden
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:29.540]  Seats from something i'm thinking maybe the jets. Yeah, that's possible stadium. Yeah, i'll bet before they built the metal ants, right?
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:35.140]  Right. Yeah, so they let I forget I think it was a phillies game was the last game and there was I forget
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.780]  I actually forget if they were allowing
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:44.020]  Allowing fans to take the seats or if fans just did did it on their own like people
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:50.100]  Guys from a crew from south philly came in with a ratchet set and just started taking the seats out
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:53.380]  Maybe they'll let us do that at town hall and take like a souvenir. Yeah
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.900]  Take a souvenir
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.660]  We we not only did we so we had those seats and then the other thing that we had were
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:14.980]  Um when they made the movie the natural in order to make it look like the the stands were full they had these like like
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.220]  cardboard people
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:22.660]  That they put in and then they just like they'd intersperse real people here and there to make it look like a real crowd
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:27.380]  And so somehow I don't know how we got these but we had like cardboard people from that movie
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:32.580]  And they said we put we put them in those chairs from the metal lens or whatever from you know, whatever it was before the melons
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.140]  Wouldn't it be cool that's cool I didn't know they had cardboard people for that
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.420]  I think that was a common trick because it wasn't it isn't it the story that in
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:46.740]  The metal ceremony in star wars that most of the people most of the rebels were were cardboard cutouts
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.660]  Were they current was it cardboard or was it was it a a matte painting?
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:54.260]  I don't know. I don't know one or the other it seems like it would have been a matte painting, but I
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.260]  Couldn't tell you. Yeah
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:04.020]  That's pretty cool so i'm i'm maybe I should take a big suitcase with me yeah, I should
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:11.540]  That'd be a hard hard carry on wouldn't that be funny trying to put a chair from down all into the x-ray machine
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:17.220]  And tried to convince the trying to convince the flight crew you just just get the you know
[01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:21.300]  Get the concierge people to mail it for you. This will fit the overhead. No problem
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.180]  They are they are small seats. They might fit in the overhead
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.580]  What are they getting I don't know are they keeping I mean they're I assume they're keeping
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:37.700]  Infinite loop and yes, they are absolutely the infinite loop camp. They're so
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:45.460]  They're so overflowing with employees and so in need of office space that I don't I don't even know how they're I
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.100]  They have a bunch of
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:53.940]  A bunch of interim buildings in cupertino. I mean, I don't know how interim interim is but
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:56.580]  um
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.260]  I forget what the reason was. Uh
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:06.120]  I I but I know I just know that there are apple buildings in cupertino
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:12.260]  That you would never even guess where apple buildings it's not even because necessarily they're like secret like it's you know
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:16.180]  It's not like the project titan team or something like that just people working on stuff
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:22.180]  But that there's no more room in infinite loop and the new campus isn't open and so they're just you know
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:26.180]  anything, you know, I think if you own an office building in cupertino, it's like
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:28.820]  salad days
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.860]  um
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:35.460]  I know I so I my understanding is that infinite loop will remain fully occupied that some there are certainly some people there who are
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:39.540]  Moving to the new office or the new building, but yeah, they're going to take up all this space
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.660]  Well, it seems like they might have used for town hall then
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:46.180]  Yeah, because i'm sure that they could still have team meetings in there and stuff like that
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.740]  So they might need the seats
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:51.860]  I think they could have a standing meeting
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:57.140]  Try it just see what happens I don't even know why I want these seats
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:01.220]  They're so they're very small and uncomfortable. So I I don't even know why I want one
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:08.500]  I just like the idea of like me and jason snell taking them apart. Mm-hmm. Sure. Dalrymple could probably he could easily go
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.820]  Oh, yeah, dalrymple. Yeah, he's probably got three already
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.820]  Yeah
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.780]  Almost certainly broken a few of them already
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.300]  Um
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:26.740]  Breaking news. We've got apples, uh, as we're recording apple's quarterly final. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I forgot about that coming up
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:29.700]  I don't know that they had a business yet. Uh
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:33.620]  I think they're doomed
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:38.980]  This just says doomed. Well, that's I'm just reading tim cook's remarks
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:46.020]  Tim cook says tim cook could not be more excited quote quote about iphone seven seven plus demand
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.580]  Which outstrips supply that's you know
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.300]  No numbers applied to that. Yeah
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:54.980]  Uh, yeah, so iphone's above
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:01.380]  Estimates. Yeah, it looks like they're a little bit above but they're still down year over year 45 million
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:05.300]  But yeah that the consensus was 43 million. So they sold an extra 2 million
[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:07.780]  Uh
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:12.340]  um max sales 4.9 million down from 5.7, but
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.900]  It's just like the whole reason
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.300]  part of the reason that I
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:22.100]  Was willing to record the show before this results is I didn't expect these results to be that exciting
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:28.600]  And part of it is just like we've just spent 90 minutes talking about how every single mac in the lineup is outdated
[01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:32.180]  And yeah, right anybody, you know, so I don't think it's a shock
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.780]  I don't think it's a sign of problems with the mac that sales are slightly down
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:37.780]  I think it's almost shocking that they were
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:39.860]  They weren't down more. Yeah
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.420]  definitely
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.300]  He says that the tim cook says they're thrilled with the
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:50.020]  Customer response to apple watch series 2 and the iphone 7 and 7 plus
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:54.660]  But the other reason that this quarter is not that interesting is this quarter ended at the end of september
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:02.260]  So the only iphone 7 sales that are even comp, you know, it counted are the like initial opening weekend sales
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.660]  Yes
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.220]  So I don't think there's anything all that interesting here
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:12.340]  Average selling price for the iphone is up but down for both the ipad and the mac
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:15.300]  Hmm. Well, I think that makes sense because that makes sense
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.140]  I think it makes sense because I think most of the people who are buying a mac are the people who are
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:25.700]  I'm, not even gonna say uninformed but that they don't even care, you know about whether it's a year-old chipset or something like that
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:32.580]  I wouldn't be surprised. I would expect that average selling price of the mac is going to go up next time we hear from from
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.340]  From apple
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.340]  Because I think there's a lot of people waiting
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.300]  Um
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:43.460]  Here let me just take a break here. This is a good time and thank our third and final sponsor
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:47.140]  Uh, I love these guys. They've they've been with the show for a long time
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:56.740]  Mailchimp 12 million people use mailchimp to connect with their customers to market their products and grow their e-commerce business
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.980]  every day
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:04.740]  When you connect your store with one of mailchimp's hundreds of e-commerce integrations, you can create targeted campaigns
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:11.620]  automate helpful product follow-ups and send back in stock messaging so you could use mailchimp you think like
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.540]  Oh, all you do with them is you send newsletters
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:19.060]  Well, you could do a lot more anything by email you can do with mailchimp so you can do things like if you have a store
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:24.420]  Have people notified by email when the thing that they were looking for that was out of stock when it's back in stock
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.260]  And it'll just happen automatically
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:29.460]  You don't have to like, you know, you just connect it to your back end system
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:36.900]  They've got all the integration learn what your customers are purchasing and then send them better email that is actually targeted to what they've actually
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.540]  expressed an interest in buying
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.260]  When you connect your store to mailchimp
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:48.580]  They analyze the purchase history of each customer to make smart data-driven predictions about what they'll want to buy in the future
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:52.660]  It's enterprise level technology made simple for everyone and it's just drag and drop
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:56.980]  It's like everything else in mailchimp where it's very very visual. It looks good
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.180]  It's not you know
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:03.860]  Like you're in the midst of like a excel table where you're connecting all this stuff in a database or something like that
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:08.180]  It's all very visual highly highly visually oriented. Uh
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:15.720]  Really great stuff you can integrate with things like wordpress facebook shopify magento
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:21.220]  Uh, you can't they have a list of things that they integrate with i'd be here all day if I read them all
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.980]  um
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:29.480]  Really great stuff. You can connect your mailchimp account with hundreds of powerful web services and you can sync the applications
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:37.060]  You use to run your business and break down the data silos between different platforms and your workflow becomes more efficient
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.620]  Pricing
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.780]  Here's what here's mailchimp's pricing is amazing

[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.860]  As long as you've got 2 000 or fewer subscribers across all lists in your account

[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.020]  Gotta love that
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:44.900]  Yeah, good guys good crew good stuff. Uh, I think friend of the show ben thompson since his uh,
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:48.820]  His daily update through mailchimp very happy user of mailchimp
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.220]  uh
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:53.460]  What else we got I got a google pixel
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.860]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, you want to talk about that? Yeah a little bit. Do you have any questions?
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:38:00.180]  What questions do you have for me? I've been using it for about a while
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:03.620]  You were doing a little um
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:08.100]  Siri and assistant comparison, weren't you? Uh, I have been yes
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:12.580]  You want to talk about that or are you saving that for right? No, I blow out
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.700]  No, I it's hard to do. I don't know if i'm gonna do like a big massive comparison
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:23.460]  But I have to say like just keeping both devices with me and doing the same things on both devices
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.060]  I
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:31.620]  I I do admit I think that overall I think google assistant is a little bit ahead of siri
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:38.180]  In some ways and and the main way that I think it's ahead is just in the way that google web search is
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:41.380]  the best web search that there's still ahead of bing
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.820]  And you know duck duck go and other search engines
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:50.020]  But just things that you expect to find through traditional google where you just type google.com in a browser
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:54.500]  And type a thing in a box and you expect to get the right answer from google
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.860]  Google assistant can answer those type of things
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.900]  In general better than siri. Um
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:05.300]  But for the things I actually ask from siri and google assistant
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.540]  I they're a lot closer than to me that the conventional wisdom would have you
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:18.100]  Think that the conventional wisdom to me is that google is kicking ass in this area and that apple siri is a piece of
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:20.180]  Useless garbage
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:24.900]  I i'm not i'm saying it. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean I see this all the time
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:28.740]  I see people writing this this just seems to be the assumption that a lot of people have
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.660]  And it just isn't backed up in real life. Um
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:38.340]  I did an example on saturday. I know that it was saturday and I was I couldn't remember
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.140]  Uh, I don't know if you know this and i'm a dallas cowboys fan
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:47.380]  And I hadn't I did not I hadn't heard that I couldn't remember when dallas played again. I was an honest question. I was
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:51.380]  Pretty sure and uh, but I asked both devices
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:56.980]  When does dallas play and I didn't say the dallas cowboys. I just said when does dallas play
[01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.700]  and
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.940]  Um, if i'm going to call in correctly
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:07.380]  Google assistant gave me uh, like a
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:10.980]  Dallas cowboy score from two weeks ago
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.340]  Which is not does it was not the answer to the question
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:19.060]  Even though it and it shows you what it thinks it heard it heard me say when does dallas play?
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.900]  When does dallas play uh siri on the other hand? I said when does dallas play?
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:30.180]  Said which team and offered me the dallas mavericks dallas cowboys and uh, whatever their ice hockey team is
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:38.420]  And I tapped dallas cowboys and then siri correctly told me that dallas plays the philadelphia eagles next sunday at 8 30
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.500]  on sunday night football
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.700]  um
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:46.980]  Correct answer. I mean and a lot of my examples that I find where siri works better than
[01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:51.700]  Both alexa and google now seem to be sports based. It seems like yeah
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.820]  I was gonna say it does seem like they they have spent a bunch of time making sure that sports stuff works
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:57.700]  Well, yeah
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:02.500]  and part of it is that the I don't know part of it is siri and what siri says to you and part of
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:06.580]  It is that they've apple has partnered with yahoo sports and yahoo sports seems to have
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.460]  Not just good information, but it seems to have it
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:14.340]  Uh structured in a way that siri can really take advantage of it
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:20.420]  Um, and you know, so maybe you know, my perspective as somebody who's a relatively big sports fan is, you know, maybe
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:27.860]  Better suited to serious sports focus than people who aren't but I just think that the general idea that the google assistant is
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:33.140]  Way way way ahead of siri is just not true. And then the other thing that I just linked to the other day was uh,
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.020]  MK, uh bhd
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:41.540]  Uh marquez brownlee who does these amazing? Yeah, one of them. Yeah, I saw that he's like, you know
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:45.140]  when I hear about people who are like professional youtubers and I see some of their videos i'm like
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:49.380]  I cannot believe that this is a professional and then I see his and i'm like, well, he's like
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:56.180]  He was like born to be on tv. Yeah. Yeah, and he does all the video work himself
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:59.620]  I've seen him doing it in the hands-on areas at the apple events and it's amazing
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:06.040]  It's like he's a one-man studio. It is absolutely amazing watching him work. But anyway, he had a comparison
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.740]  of siri versus
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.780]  of siri versus uh google assistant
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:19.000]  And it was remarkable to me how many of them were exactly the same both in response time and accuracy
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:26.980]  Yeah, I thought you know and I think overall I was surprised and you know what I found very interesting was I assumed that
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:29.300]  assistant was much better at um
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:35.620]  The contextual questions where you ask it one question, then you ask a following question that plays off that previous question, right?
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.260]  I always I just assumed that
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.020]  The assistant would be much better. I did actually I think it is better
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:46.500]  But um, I was what I was really surprised about is that siri got any of them at all, right?
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:54.500]  I just assumed that it wouldn't that from question because i've never actually experienced that personally, but um, I haven't tried it recently
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:57.620]  And every it seemed like every time I tried it before it
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.660]  It's like it doesn't it's like, you know, it's being hit on the head each time
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:04.180]  It doesn't remember what the previous question was right and what we're talking about would be
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:11.320]  Sequences of queries like if you said hey, what what is the hey dingus? What's the dallas cowboy's record?
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.800]  And then after you get the answer then if you said when do they play next right?
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.360]  So your query is when do they play next?
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:24.600]  And you're assuming that the assistant can pick up that they means the team you just asked about 10 seconds ago. Mm-hmm
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.560]  um, yeah, I think it was he was talking about presidents or something like that and you know, like
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:34.120]  Oh, I remember when was when was so and so born and how tall and then and then how tall is he?
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.480]  Who's the president united states? How tall is he? Yeah. Yeah, that's right
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:42.600]  you know, and I think google assistant got that one right and siri did not like
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:49.000]  I think siri humorously. I think google assistant said, you know, barack obama is six foot one inches tall and and
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.520]  Siri gave him the height of the united states of america
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:59.480]  Uh, not perfect, but yeah, there were some basic ones though like, you know, what's the weather where they
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:03.560]  that the exact same speed was all was almost
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:10.520]  Striking you'd almost think that they were hooked up to the same back end given how how similar the response times were. Mm-hmm
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.240]  And apple provided siri provided a little bit more. Um, like
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:20.280]  Charts and graph kind of stuff. Yeah, I think that's a really good question
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.440]  Charts and graph kind of stuff. Yeah, um, and maybe that stuff comes from uh,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.640]  Um, well from alpha i'm not sure yeah. Well, there's one thing that
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:38.840]  MKbhd missed in his comparison and I wasn't fully aware of it either. I kind of I kind of knew this vaguely
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.680]  um
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:45.480]  Especially because i've been using air pods for the last month, but then somebody on twitter called it out
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.680]  I don't know who so i'm sorry for not giving you credit but which is that
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.680]  that siri responds
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.520]  differently
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:57.960]  Based on how you invoke it. And so if you do it purely by voice with a hey dingus
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.600]  You get more back
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.680]  uh auto audio
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:07.480]  Through audio than you do if you use the home button if you use the home button
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:11.640]  Siri makes the assumption that you're ready to touch things
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:18.200]  So just for example my example from the other day when I asked about when to quote when does dallas play unquote?
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:24.280]  It gave me a on-screen listing of which which dallas and the three teams and I could tap it
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.440]  But if I was doing it through air pods, it would be an audio prompt
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.920]  Oh, okay
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.960]  How would it?
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.320]  It would just ask you like it would need it would name them. I think so. I could okay
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.000]  Try it and get back get back to you. But yeah, don't do it right now
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:44.920]  Uh, but I think i've seen that too where I have another
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.360]  Uh, at least one other amy in my context and so it's like if I say text amy
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:57.960]  Blah blah blah if i'm doing it through the air pods I can I can answer just auto audio lead that I want
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.160]  You know, right my wife not the other one. Yeah, um
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.560]  So that's an interesting difference
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.160]  But it's just I I really do think that that the conventional wisdom on
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:14.200]  Where siri stands compared to the state of the art is way off it may be behind I wouldn't I probably wouldn't
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.200]  dispute that overall
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:23.240]  But it's so multi-variant in so many different areas and there are clearly some areas where siri is actually ahead that I
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.840]  I do think that they're all in the same ballpark at this point. Yeah. Yeah
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:31.960]  I think and I know and I don't have a device currently that uh,
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:37.960]  Will will do that assistant. So I haven't played around with it in a long time and
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:42.760]  You know, i'm just relying on what everybody says but it sure really is like
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:47.880]  Conventional wisdom that it google is so much far ahead and it does not seem to be
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.040]  Really that far ahead. Yeah, I would almost say that
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:57.960]  If anything the conventional wisdom isn't so much underestimating siri is overestimating google assistant
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.880]  And again for like trivia questions
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:08.040]  It is a little better because it's just you know, like if you just treat it as a vocal input for the google search box
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.440]  But for a lot of contextual stuff, it's not
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:15.000]  Yeah, and it doesn't know things like uh, I could never I couldn't
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:21.000]  Couldn't figure out how to take a screenshot on my pixel and asking google assistant was absolutely no help
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:29.080]  I you know, i'm not shocked that it wasn't a help but it does seem like if you're supposed to be able to talk to your
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:35.400]  Device, it seems like the device, you know, and eventually it should be the case that you could if you're if you have a phone
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.840]  That is a vocal assistant. You should be able to send it to someone else
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.040]  But if you have a vocal assistant, you should be able to say how do I take a screenshot and it should be able to tell you
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:46.920]  Don't you think yeah. Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, that's
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.080]  It seems like that's that's exactly what it should
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:58.760]  Get right because that's what they have complete control over right? I mean that kind of you know, it's like, you know spotlight for
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:07.880]  But by voice, yeah the trick with taking a screenshot on the the android devices is that you press the power button and volume down
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160]  But you have to press them at the same time
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.280]  Maybe not quite, you know, like a hundredth of a second same time
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.440]  but if you press one before the other it doesn't work like if you press volume down even slightly before the power you
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.920]  immediately start changing the
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:30.280]  The volume and if you turn power and don't quite hit volume down within the very slip small fraction of a second it
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.800]  Powers, you know brings up the do you want to turn your phone off thing? Yeah
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.600]  I had a I wasn't sure how to reboot. Um
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.600]  The iphone 7 because when karen and hank both got theirs
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.680]  I had to I was setting theirs up restoring their their backups to their phones and
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.480]  At one point one of them froze
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.320]  and I had to
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.360]  force
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  restart it and
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:00.600]  Yeah, because now it's now it's the power. What does it know? It's the no, it's volume button. Yeah, and the power button. Yeah
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.280]  I think you hold down both volume and and power or something
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.480]  Yeah, and I think I ended up just doing it by accident because I was just trying everything
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  Because I couldn't understand why it wasn't working
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.880]  When I was doing the home button and the and the power button
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:21.160]  Uh, what other do you have any other pixel questions? Um, I will say so
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.080]  uh, you know, everybody seems to think that it looks I don't think it looks that great but
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  How does it feel in?
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:29.000]  real life
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.840]  It's I got the smaller one
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:35.960]  I got the five inch one and I realized that after I forget how many android phones i've had over the last few years
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.720]  But they've all been way too big for my tastes and this is the first this is the first android phone i've ever purchased
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  That is either
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.200]  Not a piece of junk and not too big
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.680]  It's it is clearly a little bigger than the iphone. Um,
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.400]  the 4.7 inch iphones, I mean not just
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.360]  You know looking at it, but it feels a little bigger
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.240]  It is a little wider, which is the biggest difference, but it's nowhere near as wide as an iphone 7 plus
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.440]  And so it's you know, I could live with this as the size of my phone
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.400]  So I I appreciate that's the that's the small one and it's it's bigger than the iphone 7
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:14.360]  Yeah, it's exactly as much bigger as you would think given that this that the display is
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.520]  Five inches instead of 4.7 inches
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.000]  Yeah
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.080]  And when you just look at it and you can kind of see that it has a chin and forehead of roughly the same proportions
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.200]  As an iphone, you know, just that basic, you know, the fact that looking at it front on it
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:34.360]  Clearly I don't even I can I think it's almost admirable that they're not denying it that it looks like an iphone
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.160]  It feels exactly as much bigger as you would think given that the display is a little bigger. Yeah
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.560]  It is
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.840]  It's interesting that it that that's the stage
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:50.440]  that's what's going on in that market because um, we have some friends and uh, and
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.080]  her father
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:53.960]  um
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.960]  Recently bought his first iphone
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:02.040]  After having android for years because he wanted he got the se because he wanted a smaller phone and he could simply could not get one
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:07.560]  In the android market, right? Well, it's nowhere near se sized. So there's no yeah. No, clearly not
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.200]  A gaping hole in the android market at that size. But yeah, you know, this is the to mine
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:19.160]  I think sony has had some phones roughly this size that are considered high-end android phones, but i've never used one
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.280]  so yeah
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.560]  but what I find that really funny because that's always one of the things that people say is
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:28.360]  The advantage of the android ecosystem is that you have so many different
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:32.680]  Manufacturers that you can get a phone any kind of phone that you want
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:37.000]  And any kind of phone that you want as long as it's not a four-inch screen
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.080]  Right as long as it's giant. Yeah, right as long as it's huge
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.000]  uh
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.480]  I I don't know quite what the I you know
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:46.520]  I don't know
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:51.800]  I've always I think part of that is too is that they need it for battery life that battery life is in general worse on
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.240]  android than
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:55.240]  Ios and okay
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:00.600]  I'm not quite sure though. Um, I will say battery life on this device is fine. It seems exactly
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.640]  Equivalent to the iphone 7 with extended use
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.800]  Uh, well, it's a little bit thicker at one end right because it doesn't have a camera
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.600]  It doesn't have a camera bump it edge. It's like wedge shaped, right?
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:15.640]  I can't believe that nobody commented on this at the original debate, but we're not debate the uh,
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.640]  Event product introduction event where I was like if it doesn't have a camera bump
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.280]  But the it's thicker on one end than the other
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:27.240]  Is it a wedge shape or is it like a step design where the glass part?
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:32.120]  Is thicker and the other part is thinner and there's a step in between and the answer is it's a wedge shape
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:38.120]  A gent, you know, it's obviously not quite as wedge shaped as like a macbook air right there is a wedge shape to it
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:43.480]  I don't love that. I mean people yeah, well people were saying oh look there's no there's no camera bump
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.680]  Hahaha, and I thought well wait a minute there has to be you know, you know
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.560]  Either either people were wrong about the fact that there had to be a camera bump because of physics
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.600]  Or right or it has to be thicker one of the other it's a you know
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:02.120]  It's sort of on apple like but I think camera bumps are on apple like I can't decide what would be more
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.960]  On apple like right right the camera bump or a wedge shape
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:12.120]  It does feel a little a little on top heavy in my hand because it's thicker at the top than the bottom
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:18.200]  But not too much and even when I and maybe it's my imagination almost because when I balance it on my finger the balance point
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:21.880]  Is only slightly towards the top instead of the center point? Yeah
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:25.240]  And the fact that it doesn't have a camera bump is nice
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.120]  I will say
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.120]  I mean, I don't have a camera bump either but
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.320]  The touch id sensor is extremely fast. It's it
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.480]  If it's not as fast as apples, it's close to as fast
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:41.800]  it takes suspiciously shorter time to
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.560]  train
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.920]  than apple
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:50.360]  And I just reset an iphone another iphone the other day and went through it again. So the memory it's not it is fresh
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:58.440]  It definitely takes fewer lift lift and put it back down to get your finger registered with the pixel fingerprint sensor. So either
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.760]  Either they're actually training it a lot faster than apple or they're
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:05.560]  They're looser about right
[01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:09.080]  I don't know I you know, but I can't I certainly haven't had you know
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:12.360]  I've tried using other fingers and it never falsely unlocks the phone
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:16.360]  So it seems all right
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:20.600]  Camera's good. They have one. So it seems yeah, it seems like I mean some people were
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.560]  Questioning I mean everybody seemed to think that it was you know, at least as good as the iphone
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.440]  One and some people maybe thought it was even better and then the other people were saying how can you say that?
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.320]  Look at this look at how yellow this picture is and I was like, I don't see I don't see any yellow in that picture
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:38.360]  I don't know what you're talking about. You know, i've taken some side by side
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:44.440]  I've gone out sometimes in the daytime and you know had both phones with me and there was a theater around the corner from our house
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.200]  That just got just blown up. Uh, I guess they didn't blow it up, but they ripped it apart now
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:55.000]  It's a big hole in the ground which I for some reason find an interesting thing to take pictures of
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:02.280]  And they you know, they both look very good to me it is you know, it's ad
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:05.400]  You know, I can't say that one is better than the other but they both look good
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.920]  Every once in a while one will look a little better than the other I find that
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:14.440]  The pictures are way closer between the two than in a lot of the examples. I linked to last week
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:19.960]  I linked to a whole bunch of google pixel reviews and most of them had like side-by-side comparisons with the iphone 7 camera
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:26.440]  And some of them made the iphone 7 pictures look very washed out to me where I would just say the color
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.920]  It just seemed like they were much brighter like if somebody took a picture of a field of grass side by side
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:37.960]  That the pixel one looked bright green and very nice and that the iphone one looked a little drab which doesn't match my
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:42.120]  Experience with the iphone camera at all and it really makes me wonder whether
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:47.160]  What processing they were doing with the images to get them from here to there
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.840]  In my use side by side the the colors are very very similar between the two cameras
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.560]  Um, yeah, I mean, I have a nice and i'm not i'm not
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.200]  i'm, also definitely not a um enough of a
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.880]  camera person to I mean like i've said this before but I
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.720]  Feel like the camera topped out for me at the iphone 4
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.320]  My favorite feature of the whole phone I think is that there's a
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:18.280]  System-wide shortcut where if you double tap the power button it puts you in camera mode
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.720]  No matter what you're doing
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:25.160]  So if the phone is off and locked double tap it and you're in that quickly. I just did it and you're in the
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.440]  And you're in that quickly. I just did it and then you're in that's cool
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.720]  If you're using the phone like you're just reading your email and you want to take a picture of something
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:40.440]  Quick double tap that button and you jump to camera mode and the camera mode does start up about as fast as you could reasonably
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  Expect ready to take a picture
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.480]  um
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.480]  that's a really cool feature and
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.720]  I think on the iphone it's I i've just started getting used to the lift to
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.880]  Whatever they call it. Oh, yeah raise to raise to wake the phone wake
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:01.560]  Yes, and my favorite aspect of raise to wake with the iphone 7 is you raise to wake and if you want to take a picture
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.120]  You just slide the the lock screen to the left and you're in the camera. Yeah
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.360]  And so i've really gotten used to that
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.960]  So when my phone if I see something I want to take a picture of quickly I can
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.640]  Take it out of my pocket raise to wake almost always turns on when I take it out of my pocket and just start sliding to the
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:24.920]  And just start sliding to the left anywhere. I don't have to aim for like a little camera icon in the corner or anything anymore
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.600]  Love that feature
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:28.600]  uh, I actually think that
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:35.560]  That's probably a little better than the double tap the button that this pixel has but when you're actually already in the phone and unlocked
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.520]  I think that the the pixel shortcut is actually quicker. Yeah having something universal. I mean, I guess you can you can swipe up and then
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:48.680]  But that's not as quick as double tapping that button. No, no, and it's also you know, sometimes doesn't work, right?
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.960]  Right double tapping this button always works. I can't remember which app it is, but there's an app that I use
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.680]  Oh, it's actually notes
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:57.640]  um
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:58.840]  I have a
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.840]  Like if i'm in a note
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:07.080]  And now now it seems to be working maybe maybe because maybe um, uh, maybe that got fixed in the most recent update
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.160]  But I was having a hell of a time invoking
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.680]  Invoking the control center thing whatever that thing is called at the bottom
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.160]  um and notes
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:17.800]  I did the thing. Um
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:24.840]  Where you can connect the pixel to your iphone through a cable in the initial setup and it'll slurp over what it can
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.120]  and you know this I put in a slack that we're both members of but right it
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.200]  it's
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:34.520]  It makes the pixel look like a pc
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.760]  To the iphone and you that's what the adapter is. The adapter is like a usba theme
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:44.760]  So the iphone will give you the do you trust this computer prompt that it's supposed to to make sure you're not getting hacked
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:48.120]  Uh, you know, so so is this just for pictures?
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:54.520]  No, it it will do all sorts of things including your sms messages and my messages. Wow
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.800]  If well, here's the there is a catch
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:02.440]  The catch is while you're going through the setup. I have my my iphone
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.940]  my iphone, uh backups encrypted
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:07.160]  uh
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:10.120]  They tell you that if you'd like to slurp over all that stuff you have to
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:15.660]  You have to connect your connect your iphone to itunes and turn off backup encryptions
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  Or encrypt your backups
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:22.360]  Uh, and then it'll be able to do it. Otherwise, it will only be able to get your pictures
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:29.160]  Um, and maybe something one or two other things. I was like, thanks, but no, no, thanks. I'm not going to
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:34.360]  Did uh, i'm not that interested in it. So I did have it slurp over all my pictures
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:36.600]  and
[01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:42.200]  It didn't get them all. I don't really know what the hell happened. But part of it I think is the fact that i've got
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:47.560]  Obviously, this is what I think what is the problem is is I have I found iCloud photo library on
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:53.880]  So however many tens of thousands of photos I have in my overall iCloud library, they're not all on my iphone
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:57.080]  So it only grabbed some of the the ones that are actually present
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.880]  And then the worst part was it took
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.400]  1590 of them
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.240]  and
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:08.760]  And the day that I did this was october 20th, and it gave all
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:13.160]  1590 of my photos the date of october 20th 2016
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:18.680]  Yeah, and most of them were I think what happened. I haven't done like a full investigation
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:23.800]  But I think what happened is that these were images where they didn't have the date in the exif data
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.000]  That the date was only the file date the file system date
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:33.640]  My phone my iphone knows exactly what date they were picked by, you know on my mac everywhere
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.360]  I've had these photos like they they were in my
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:42.280]  I photo library from back when I photo was a thing. I've had these photos. Most of them were like 10 years old
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.840]  a lot of them were the images that
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.560]  From until like 2006 or so. I was I think around 2006
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:54.840]  I think around 2006. I still shot a lot of images on 35 millimeter film with a with an slr
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:58.680]  And then what I would do is when I got those photos developed, I would have them scan
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.240]  I would have the photo development place scan them to a cd
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:06.360]  And a lot of them were those images and I just think that they didn't put exif data in them
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  I think but the dates just came from the dates on the cd, you know, the files had dates. They just weren't like official
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:19.720]  Met anyway, google gave me 1600 photos on that date and it was that that that wasn't good. Um
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.520]  I would I I think I would have been better off
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.600]  I I I don't know that to me that the upgrade from your phone is a little bit of a gimmick
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:33.080]  I I don't know. I think I would have been better off setting it up fresh, but it took it
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:35.160]  It took it from a backup
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.320]  Or you just had you just had to connect you just had to turn off the encryption
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:45.640]  Oh, because it was probably the phone your iphone was thinking. Oh, i'm only going to give anything an encrypted backup. Yes, exactly
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:51.160]  Yeah, right. Exactly. So you have to yeah, that's a I didn't know I never really thought about how that worked
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:55.720]  But that's about how it worked and I had no interest in that. I wasn't curious enough about how it worked to do that
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:01.720]  Yeah, I didn't realize that anything other than itunes could get your I mean, I guess it makes sense if it's not encrypted
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:07.880]  But I mean right that I just never had any experience with that anything other than itunes getting stuff. I mean obviously
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:11.320]  Camera, there's other camera apps that can grab the photos
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.720]  But I didn't know that like things like sms messages were also
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.880]  possible
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:22.120]  Uh, what else finger put fingerprint sensor on the back? No good
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:27.960]  It is it's inconvenient as you would know. Oh, no, I didn't. Yeah, there's not the back. Yeah
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.760]  It's where the apple logo is on an iphone. Yeah, it's you know, it's not the worst
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:35.960]  But you do have to you you do have to fish around for it sometimes
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:42.840]  Yeah, uh, and you can't I can't figure out why sometimes I can wake the phone by doing it and sometimes I can't uh
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:47.720]  It just is not as good as having the fingerprint sensor where apple put it
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:54.760]  Yeah, now could be that i've you know, i've got a couple of years of iphone experience and it's a little subjective, but
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.880]  I don't think so
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:04.040]  What else material it's the aluminum is actually like more of a metal
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.080]  Is actually like more of a matte finish than apples
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:12.760]  It doesn't really feel as nice, but I think it's less slippery. So there's a practical advantage to it
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:16.360]  Uh, I think it's very cute. I got the black one. Of course
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:23.000]  I think it's very strange that they named the color quite black like which is a very googly cutie thing
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.640]  When in fact, it's not quite black at all
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:32.680]  In fact honest to god the better name for it would be not quite black because it's very very clearly just a dark gray
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.200]  And the display is black. So when you look at it, especially in sunlight
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.800]  Both on the front and the rear it's it is definitely dark gray not black
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:46.200]  So it seems very funny to me that they named it quite black
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:51.720]  Yeah, I mean not quite black would be even funnier. Yeah. I mean, you know, it'd be like a funnier joke
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.840]  and more accurate
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.640]  Uh, what else and other than that? It's a very nice phone. I do think that this oled display
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:05.960]  I've compared it the best comparison I could think of is looking at instagram and I look at the same photos on both phones on instagram
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:07.720]  uh
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.760]  and
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:14.440]  Especially in in kit to me in incandescent lighting meaning photos that are taken indoors. Uh,
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:17.480]  At you know nighttime
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:23.960]  The I I don't think it's it's not the camera because the these images are from instagram. It's the display it makes
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:31.480]  People look sort of yellowy. It makes it it the oled display to me gets it. It's a very orangey yellowy color
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.520]  That looks un it doesn't look like to me what a room looks like in indoor lighting
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:43.560]  Whereas the iphone does so I i'm still skeptical about oled as a replacement for lcd's on on these devices
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.240]  And then last but not least I still really dislike android
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.240]  Really dislike android
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.920]  Well, I hope my pictures look good on my magic toolbar
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:01.320]  I'm kind of worried about that
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:06.120]  I will say this I would summarize it like this if I could run ios on this device
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:09.560]  I I would not be as happy as I am with the iphone 7
[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:13.480]  But I this is the first android device i've ever used where I think i'd be fine
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.640]  And I wouldn't hate my life every day that I had to do it if I could run ios on this device
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:21.720]  It would be fine. It is by far and away the nicest android phone i've ever used
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.840]  Um, that's pretty good. I could you know
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:29.640]  I I would need an entire three-hour episode of the show to go through what I don't like about it, right? Yeah
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  Well, have a good time on thursday, all right pick up a couple of macbooks for me
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:38.360]  I will try to get you a chair
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:40.360]  being a chair
