[00:00.000 --> 00:03.960]  it's been too long it really has I don't know why it's like some of my favorite
[00:03.960 --> 00:07.280]  people to have on the show are the ones that I put off putting them back in the
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.400]  show because I want it to be I want it to be special and then you know and then
[00:12.400 --> 00:16.240]  it gets to the point where I'm like you know what I can't wait any longer I got
[00:16.240 --> 00:21.960]  to have jock it on show I'm just curious what the what the sandwich is gonna be
[00:21.960 --> 00:25.480]  you know you should get Adam Lee's ago or you should get Adam Lee's ago or on
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.760]  sandwich sandwich then it'd be a sandwich sandwich right last episode was
[00:29.760 --> 00:38.160]  Ben Thompson that was my emergency Johnny I've has retired episode yes and
[00:38.160 --> 00:42.320]  that was good it was good Ben Thompson always good Ben Thompson very
[00:42.320 --> 00:48.160]  insightful on stuff like that but it was also I was saving it up see you know me
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.720]  you know me very well that's it it's you know I think you've you've got me down
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.640]  cold I don't I don't celebrate stuff like episode 200 you know I mean like
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.800]  when episode 200 rolls around I don't do anything special I don't even mention it
[01:03.800 --> 01:11.920]  last episode though was episode 256 and as a nerd 256 hits me harder than
[01:11.920 --> 01:17.000]  something like an episode 200 are you the same way yeah except for I would
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.880]  have to you know I'm the excitement's over by 256 it's all 255 it's all it's
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.320]  all the party is like 255 and 256 is the hangover see because the thing is the
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.040]  thing is as you know as well as I do that if if there's intelligent life
[01:32.040 --> 01:40.560]  elsewhere in the universe maybe and if they're even vaguely hominid type
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.000]  lifeforms you know if they even look vaguely like us maybe they have eight
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.080]  fingers maybe they have 12 fingers maybe they only have six fingers but the the
[01:51.080 --> 01:58.160]  fact that we have a decimal mathematical system is clearly and unambiguously the
[01:58.160 --> 02:02.920]  fact that we have ten figures right so these numbers like a hundred and two
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.520]  hundred are completely arbitrary based on the number of fingers we have I'm not
[02:08.520 --> 02:14.080]  saying I don't notice I notice when I'm publishing episode 200 or you know a
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.320]  couple weeks from now or months from now when I up is when I do episode 300 I'll
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.400]  notice but it doesn't hit me the way like 255 or 256 does because I realize
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.960]  that no matter where you are in the universe even if you've got you know
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.720]  you're a species with eight fingers maybe you're a species with 12 maybe
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.120]  you're a species that doesn't have hands I don't know what the hell yeah but if
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.640]  you've invented computers you're gonna know that 256 is a magic number who
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.600]  knows what representation you're gonna put it in but it's gonna be a magic
[02:46.600 --> 02:52.760]  number because binary mm-hmm is magic that is that's a good point good
[02:52.760 --> 03:01.800]  observation well well but now you're 257 so I mean I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna be
[03:01.800 --> 03:10.120]  a part of a beautiful sandwich though so I have how's your summer going it's
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.920]  freaking hot you're in Philly right so or have you been in Philly the heatwave
[03:16.920 --> 03:22.760]  no well we were in Florida earlier in the month and it was actually less hot
[03:22.760 --> 03:29.600]  and humid this right now right now they say I'm looking at the dark sky app 91
[03:29.600 --> 03:38.400]  feels like 99 but yesterday it was six o'clock at night and it it was 94
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.200]  degrees but it felt like I guess that's the heat index 106 which is insane like
[03:44.200 --> 03:52.000]  plus 12 on the heat index is absolutely insane yeah that's nuts we we just went
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.160]  actually for a quick weekend to get away up to Vermont we don't have any
[03:56.160 --> 03:59.440]  particular tie to Vermont it's just you know as you know you you lived in
[03:59.440 --> 04:03.640]  Massachusetts for a while suddenly you're close Massachusetts to all these
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.760]  great northeastern states and Vermont is one of them what's great about a place
[04:08.760 --> 04:13.960]  like Vermont is it's relatively unspoiled compared to the rest of the
[04:13.960 --> 04:20.920]  country slash world and so we went up to Vermont and it was freaking hot there as
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.680]  well but it's the kind of place where you can just like walk over to the
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.800]  nearest river and sit down in a river yeah you wouldn't want to do that in
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.760]  Philly one of the things I love about Vermont and I don't know if it's state
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.600]  wide I don't know if it's only the roads I've been on the handful of times I've
[04:37.600 --> 04:41.160]  been there but I have been there one of the things I love is that when I've been
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.000]  there and it might be statewide I don't know but they there's no billboard
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.280]  advertisements at all it's it's illegal it is against the law they just preserve
[04:50.280 --> 04:57.040]  it so you're driving on these roads and the only thing interrupting the natural
[04:57.040 --> 05:02.560]  woods and and the mountains is the road you're on you know like the actual
[05:02.560 --> 05:07.000]  macadam you're driving on is the only interruption and there's no
[05:07.000 --> 05:12.920]  advertisements for coca-cola or movies or what whatever you have and and it's
[05:12.920 --> 05:17.600]  truly a beautiful beautiful state it is yeah I mean I didn't know that about
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.200]  Vermont but I'm not surprised if that's true at the but the place I had
[05:21.200 --> 05:26.160]  consciously noticed that is also true about before is Maine yeah it's also
[05:26.160 --> 05:31.320]  huge and it's also beautiful and one of the funny things I noticed is there's no
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.000]  billboards but apparently the state just thinks you get too bored or something if
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.160]  you don't see something every once in a while so occasionally there's like an
[05:39.160 --> 05:44.120]  advertisement for the state itself oh they just keep driving along it's like
[05:44.120 --> 05:49.520]  hey Maine how about that you know I like it would you there's also signs that we
[05:49.520 --> 05:54.040]  don't have in Pennsylvania like a moose crossing right yeah we don't have moose
[05:54.040 --> 05:57.280]  in Pennsylvania no no no you got a problem if you got a moose in
[05:57.280 --> 06:01.080]  Pennsylvania yeah we've got deer but they just let you hit them they don't
[06:01.080 --> 06:03.920]  even warn you when you when you're crossing they're just like just just
[06:03.920 --> 06:07.320]  drive right through them just put get it over with yeah just get it over with
[06:07.320 --> 06:11.160]  take your car into the shop get the dense taken out somebody will pick up
[06:11.160 --> 06:17.960]  the hands oh my god you know what what do you want to talk about you got
[06:17.960 --> 06:25.360]  anything on your mind well I actually just as luck would have it I just kind
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.880]  of like maybe even kind of rushed out blog post so I hope I didn't screw
[06:28.880 --> 06:34.400]  anything up but I wanted to publish something it was on my mind and you
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.240]  invited me on the show today and I thought well I'm gonna get this out
[06:36.240 --> 06:42.000]  because I want to talk to John about it and so it's gonna be one of these things
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.240]  I think it's gonna be either really interesting or somebody will point out
[06:45.240 --> 06:51.720]  some reason I got it all wrong or both but the key takeaway from this blog post
[06:51.720 --> 07:00.680]  I just published is a sort of a consequence that I I observed with the
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.080]  whole new app notarization thing on the Mac all right you know about this and
[07:04.080 --> 07:10.040]  it's the next level of all of these mounting you know restrictions slash
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.680]  you know security enhancements that Mac developers have been facing over the
[07:14.680 --> 07:21.240]  past ten years plus and the notarization system is new last year and it
[07:21.240 --> 07:26.880]  essentially is a process where you before shipping an app you send it to
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.480]  Apple and they scan it for I guess they say known malware but then they also
[07:31.480 --> 07:37.240]  sort of verify that it's using it's not a very restrictive set of API's but like
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.400]  there's certain API's and certain like library loading behaviors that you're
[07:41.400 --> 07:48.680]  not allowed to use things that things that they know are bad news yeah mostly
[07:48.680 --> 07:53.840]  or things and then they think are bad news yeah exactly exactly when some of
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.520]  them I think most people would agree are bad news so that's good and they're
[07:56.520 --> 07:59.440]  scanning for that and then some of its kind of middle of the road and and then
[07:59.440 --> 08:02.240]  there's this kind of opt-in system where you just say okay I'm doing this thing
[08:02.240 --> 08:09.960]  like for instance you can say I want to be able to load libraries from signed by
[08:09.960 --> 08:16.960]  entities that are not myself or Apple by default with this new notarization
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.440]  system it's called the hardened runtime goes with it and by default you're only
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.960]  allowed to load shared libraries by signed by the company that also signed
[08:24.960 --> 08:30.080]  the app right or by Apple itself so that's an example of something where you
[08:30.080 --> 08:33.760]  can opt out of it because Apple realizes there are companies out there that load
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.240]  plugins from diverse developers for example I you know for instance recently
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.600]  I've been working for another company on some plugins for for Apple's logic and
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.400]  you know those plugins will not work if if it can't load this way anyway kind of
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.800]  going off on a tangent here but that's the key takeaway from this blog post is
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.960]  something I noticed while working on the notarization process which is and to
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.760]  emphasize this notarization is a new thing that is different than App Store
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.800]  it has nothing to do with the App Store really you you know the stuff that gets
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.560]  notarized can go right from the developers website to your computer
[09:17.560 --> 09:22.560]  without ever going through the App Store it's a different form of verification
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.240]  and and I think that's worth emphasizing you know it is worth emphasizing
[09:27.240 --> 09:33.360]  especially because it shines the light on the one kind of peculiar
[09:33.360 --> 09:39.840]  implementation detail which is that all of the notarization happens through App
[09:39.840 --> 09:46.700]  Store servers so you submit your binary using this tool called AL tool on the
[09:46.700 --> 09:50.040]  committee if you do it from the command line Apple has stuff to let you do it
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.360]  automatically through Xcode but most like I think most companies of a certain
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.760]  size and then most companies that just kind of have things automated in a
[09:57.760 --> 10:02.160]  certain way myself included you do the things you build and submit whatever
[10:02.160 --> 10:08.040]  from the command line anyway I noticed that so you so the rough outline is you
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.080]  build your app you submit it to Apple in binary form you don't have to give them
[10:11.080 --> 10:14.700]  source code or anything they scan it and then they basically keep like a
[10:14.700 --> 10:20.640]  dictionary of you know a lookup table of hashes from binaries that exist that
[10:20.640 --> 10:24.320]  have been you know in the world that have been notarized and then at runtime
[10:24.320 --> 10:29.240]  when the OS is about to launch your app I think just for the first time still
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.680]  it goes and actually checks in with Apple and says hey this is the hash what
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.600]  do you got and then it says Apple says yes or no like this is this is scanned
[10:37.600 --> 10:42.960]  or not that's kind of the rough outline anyway when I was going to notarize one
[10:42.960 --> 10:49.040]  of my apps I got an error back that said the error wasn't like your app is messed
[10:49.040 --> 10:52.480]  up or anything like it wasn't like Apple servers are messed up it was you have
[10:52.480 --> 11:01.200]  not signed the latest versions of the contracts at App Store Connect and as I
[11:01.200 --> 11:05.200]  said in this blog post I wrote I sort of just like flew right over I mean I
[11:05.200 --> 11:09.680]  didn't even think about it this is kind of like that the same criticism many
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.040]  people have for like all these new you know dialogues that say do you want to
[11:13.040 --> 11:17.200]  allow this do you want to allow that you know the classic like we criticized
[11:17.200 --> 11:23.560]  Windows for this and now Apple's doing it whatever it is this like you know you
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.000]  get used to so used to approving things you just do it almost automatically and
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.560]  I think a lot of developers like that with the App Store contracts I put out
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.680]  lawyers we're not like we're also not prepared to like say well that's it I
[11:35.680 --> 11:41.320]  guess this is my last day being an Apple App Store developer yeah I'm out you got
[11:41.320 --> 11:46.760]  me there but what's interesting about this is if I'm understanding everything
[11:46.760 --> 11:54.720]  correctly I literally had to go agree to App Store developer contracts in order
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.040]  to notarize my app to ship directly to customers right in other words you have
[11:59.040 --> 12:03.640]  to agree to App Store terms to distribute a non App Store app if you're
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.440]  going to comply with this notarization which in theory on the surface is a good
[12:10.440 --> 12:16.400]  idea you know at least the the spirit is good there's no malfeasance on Apple's
[12:16.400 --> 12:25.760]  part to encourage this right but there are very reasonable reasons why
[12:25.760 --> 12:29.960]  developed some developers for certain apps will do not want to agree to App
[12:29.960 --> 12:35.440]  Store terms yeah that's one aspect of it and then like the other aspect to me is
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.760]  just the granularity of how this has the potential to inter eat so even if you're
[12:40.760 --> 12:43.240]  just like me and you kind of blindly agree to the contracts every day
[12:43.240 --> 12:47.520]  whatever not every day but you know how often they they come out this is still a
[12:47.520 --> 12:52.240]  situation now where it's like hmm you just tried to ship an app but uh-uh you
[12:52.240 --> 13:00.360]  haven't agreed to the latest contract and that's a substantial difference from
[13:00.360 --> 13:04.800]  you know people complained about developer ID when it came out but with
[13:04.800 --> 13:07.880]  the developer ID you essentially went through this process of getting a
[13:07.880 --> 13:12.920]  certificate that was then good for years of uninterrupted software distribution
[13:12.920 --> 13:17.720]  on the Mac right so I guess you could say well you had to agree to the terms
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.760]  to you know get a developer ID but this feels differently different to me
[13:23.760 --> 13:29.240]  because of the granularity of it and the fact that you could at any time you know
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.000]  theoretically there's companies out there that might actually look at the
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.480]  new contract and say no I know that a lot of companies have lawyers who they
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.520]  at least have review every iteration of the contract so you're looking at a
[13:43.520 --> 13:49.240]  situation now where you know you you could face a situation where you're
[13:49.240 --> 13:54.080]  trying to ship an important bug fix and and it's very clear that we're if we're
[13:54.080 --> 14:00.560]  not there already we're clearly heading towards a world where a non notarized
[14:00.560 --> 14:08.040]  app is gonna be a second-class citizen yes well I mean this is I think we're
[14:08.040 --> 14:12.120]  probably there already right it's come to a head in Catalina in the Mac OS
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.440]  Catalina public beta because I mean we are already there because right now as
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.420]  it stands if you are not developer ID signed then by default you know the
[14:22.420 --> 14:25.640]  system just says you can't open this sorry it's not it's not trustworthy and
[14:25.640 --> 14:28.880]  you have to kind of know that you can do this whole dance of right-clicking it
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.880]  it's like open right or selecting it and and and the other way to get around it
[14:33.880 --> 14:39.720]  would be to select the icon in the finder and then in that if you have the
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.840]  toolbar in your finder window you can go up to the gear gear menu in the window
[14:45.840 --> 14:51.520]  and select open but there's something you know it's it's a it's equivalent
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.080]  it's the single click way of getting around the the control click or right
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.960]  click way of you know selecting an icon and and hitting open because if you just
[15:01.960 --> 15:05.680]  double click the icon you're never gonna get there right it just yeah it only
[15:05.680 --> 15:12.040]  gives you the option to quit yep that's right and the behavior as of Catalina is
[15:12.040 --> 15:15.760]  it's intensified because I think previously I said you know something
[15:15.760 --> 15:20.320]  like sorry I can't open this because it's from an unknown developer and now
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.200]  it says something like can't open this because it's dangerous and we can't scan
[15:25.200 --> 15:30.640]  it for vulnerabilities or whatever you know it's something a little bit more so
[15:30.640 --> 15:36.800]  that's sort of the sort of the premise of my blog post is you have to start
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.080]  with the assumption that every reasonable developer who is shipping Mac
[15:40.080 --> 15:45.820]  software for you know for either for a living or because they want to have a
[15:45.820 --> 15:50.080]  broad reach you have to start with the assumption that they acknowledge that
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.720]  they have to sign things with developer ID and that now we have to notarize our
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.040]  software and so starting with that premise you know of course you can still
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.960]  ship software and people can right-click it or whatever but it's a it's an
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.520]  interesting new world starting in 1015 there's there's a there's a an
[16:12.520 --> 16:18.400]  interesting barrier now that could potentially be significant if I don't
[16:18.400 --> 16:21.960]  know you know some companies like I said they have to have lawyers review these
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.200]  contracts before they agree to them and that's gonna slow some some releases
[16:27.200 --> 16:33.080]  down one thing I mentioned to you before we started recording just when we were
[16:33.080 --> 16:42.640]  texting setting this up but for years we meaning Mac experts Mac nerds Mac
[16:42.640 --> 16:48.480]  aficionados Mac developers people who really really care deeply about the
[16:48.480 --> 16:55.200]  Macintosh as a platform have been worried for years that Apple is going to
[16:55.200 --> 17:03.240]  force iOS style restrictions on Mac OS meaning hey they're gonna issue an
[17:03.240 --> 17:07.240]  update they're gonna have a WWDC where they say everything outside the App
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.720]  Store is deprecated next year you know and they never say next year but you
[17:11.720 --> 17:15.640]  know when they mean next year they'll they'll be like in dick quotes you know
[17:15.640 --> 17:21.440]  next year it's gonna be App Store only and everything you're gonna run on your
[17:21.440 --> 17:24.280]  Mac has to go through the App Store that's the thing that we've been
[17:24.280 --> 17:28.520]  worried about we don't want I don't want that I really don't I think that would
[17:28.520 --> 17:31.480]  be very bad for the platform I don't think it'd be the death of the platform
[17:31.480 --> 17:35.920]  but I really do think that part of what makes the Mac the Mac is that you can
[17:35.920 --> 17:42.080]  run arbitrary software and and I've been worried about it just because it seems
[17:42.080 --> 17:46.640]  like something Apple might do and and you know you and I have a slew of
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.280]  friends who are all in the same racket and we've all been vaguely worried about
[17:50.280 --> 17:56.480]  it and the truth is like many things in life it's like the simplistic thing
[17:56.480 --> 18:00.480]  you're worried about isn't the thing to worry about it's it's not working out
[18:00.480 --> 18:05.760]  like that I don't think that's going to happen now because a year after year as
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.120]  we see the screws tighten on some of this security stuff the Mac is evolving
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.560]  in very different ways it's not like I wouldn't call it like iOS at all but it
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.600]  is in broad terms though it is definitely more and more under Apple's
[18:23.600 --> 18:30.600]  control you know like and it's not in this not in a simplistic way like the
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.600]  way that iOS is where any kind of broad based software you want to distribute
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.840]  has to go through the App Store or you have to you know cheat like Facebook and
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.800]  Google did and abuse your beta certificate but to play by the rules on
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.600]  iOS you need to go through the App Store it's very simple and then your app needs
[18:51.600 --> 18:55.840]  to comply with all the various App Store rules the Mac isn't like that at all it
[18:55.840 --> 19:02.560]  still isn't I don't think it ever will but things like this notarization are
[19:02.560 --> 19:10.120]  Apple is a is a gatekeeper on this yeah absolutely and that's why it's so
[19:10.120 --> 19:15.400]  appropriate that the the technology on the Mac is called gatekeeper and when it
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.040]  came out I think people read a lot into that and it was like wait a minute
[19:18.040 --> 19:21.880]  they're not gonna let certain software run and you're right everyone jump to
[19:21.880 --> 19:27.440]  conclusions all right but yeah I mean I don't know it's funny because I often
[19:27.440 --> 19:31.660]  have a take on these kinds of things that is simultaneously a little bit
[19:31.660 --> 19:36.460]  worried and like a little bit I guess you could say I kind of want to you know
[19:36.460 --> 19:40.120]  I'm kind of kind of conservative in that sense that I kind of want things to just
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.280]  stay as they are but then I think I'm also pretty pragmatic about the security
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.540]  improvements like if I look at my Mac today and the world that we're living in
[19:49.540 --> 19:55.540]  and the things that crap people are out there doing I frankly can't relate too
[19:55.540 --> 19:59.680]  well to people who are like it should just be the way it used to be where you
[19:59.680 --> 20:03.080]  could download anything you want you know and everything has access to every
[20:03.080 --> 20:07.760]  file on your Mac more and more I'm like geez I'm kind of glad I have this
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.820]  locked-down Mac but well and I'm kind of glad I'm really glad by my parents have
[20:13.820 --> 20:19.700]  it I'm really glad my wife has it yeah my son has it you know like and I you
[20:19.700 --> 20:27.320]  know it's it sounds a little pretentious to say that I'm special because I I
[20:27.320 --> 20:32.360]  understand I quote understand this stuff and so I want special privileges but I
[20:32.360 --> 20:38.640]  do because I kind of do understand this but I really am and I feel like that's
[20:38.640 --> 20:44.760]  the line that Apple is walking is the line between what they do for the
[20:44.760 --> 20:54.520]  typical 98% of Mac users versus what they allow for the expert slash
[20:54.520 --> 21:00.680]  developers slash power users however you want to describe them two percent of Mac
[21:00.680 --> 21:07.640]  users who this stuff is sort of getting in the way of ya know and and I do feel
[21:07.640 --> 21:14.160]  I'm worried with with 1015 Catalina that they've sort of corrupt they're they're
[21:14.160 --> 21:20.080]  crossing the line and this is the version where they might start really
[21:20.080 --> 21:26.520]  inconveniencing us yeah yeah I mean and I imagine that depending on what your
[21:26.520 --> 21:31.560]  particular niche interest is there's been a release in the past three years
[21:31.560 --> 21:35.360]  or whatever four years maybe longer where that was the line you know I think
[21:35.360 --> 21:42.360]  I'm like scriptures I think really had it tough in the past year I think
[21:42.360 --> 21:45.840]  because of that you know I mentioned that thing about only loading Apple or
[21:45.840 --> 21:53.160]  your own libraries and yes that basically I think in 1014 effectively
[21:53.160 --> 21:57.560]  just killed a bunch of like I don't think you can I should know more about
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.000]  this off the top my head probably because of my involvement with
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.520]  scripting utilities but I should but I you know I've kind of I kind of just
[22:05.520 --> 22:10.840]  happy and I'm not completely up over my head in that these days but I think
[22:10.840 --> 22:16.760]  effectively you can't load like third-party OS X anymore from you know
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.440]  like if you use apples script runner you can't you can't do that and that's like
[22:21.440 --> 22:25.060]  whole workflows that just got broken right and yeah you're right though
[22:25.060 --> 22:30.560]  there's there's a new thing every year and I think this is gonna be another one
[22:30.560 --> 22:34.840]  of those years where it's like oh well there's a whole realm of productivity
[22:34.840 --> 22:38.440]  things that you can't do anymore but you know getting back real quickly what you
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.440]  were saying like you know are we being maybe like a little bit presumptuous
[22:42.440 --> 22:48.360]  about thinking that we know how to be safe when others don't I've really I've
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.640]  really feel myself gradually shifting over the years where every time Apple
[22:52.640 --> 22:55.880]  comes out with another one of these rounds of kind of security improvements
[22:55.880 --> 23:02.240]  I have to say I understand less and less intrinsically why they did it and then I
[23:02.240 --> 23:05.360]  have to then I start looking into it I'm like oh and they explain why they did it
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.760]  and I'm like ah geez I would have to be honest I would have never thought about
[23:09.760 --> 23:14.880]  that you know and so it's like maybe kind of edge cases but I think they're
[23:14.880 --> 23:21.320]  doing these things because they spot legitimate vulnerabilities and I guess I
[23:21.320 --> 23:26.920]  feel less and less competent myself to manage all the different aspects of my
[23:26.920 --> 23:31.960]  computer's security yeah all right let me take a break and thank our first
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.560]  sponsor and it is one of my best friends on the internet
[23:35.560 --> 23:42.240]  Squarespace I love Squarespace look you need a website maybe your friend needs a
[23:42.240 --> 23:47.360]  website maybe there's a company a local restaurant a local local business around
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.440]  the corner needs a new website they come to you because you're you're the
[23:51.440 --> 23:56.200]  neighborhood nerd they know you know what you're doing don't don't build them
[23:56.200 --> 24:00.640]  a website from scratch and then you're on the hook for all the updates and when
[24:00.640 --> 24:04.680]  things need to change and then they're calling you and calling you call send
[24:04.680 --> 24:09.160]  them to Squarespace or or get them started on Squarespace yourself build it
[24:09.160 --> 24:17.520]  hand over the keys to them because Squarespace is so easy to keep going and
[24:17.520 --> 24:23.720]  it's so easy to get started it is so easy it is a CMS so you can add blog
[24:23.720 --> 24:28.840]  posts or podcast episodes or whatever you want on a periodic basis or if you
[24:28.840 --> 24:33.880]  just need to add new pages just new sections of the website you can do that
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.840]  all of it very easy but it's also a design tool all of the design stuff all
[24:39.840 --> 24:44.720]  of the templates all of the tweaking of the design putting a logo at the top
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.640]  making sure everything is responsive so it looks great on a giant display looks
[24:49.640 --> 24:54.360]  great on an iPad looks great on a phone all of it is built right into
[24:54.360 --> 24:59.520]  Squarespace super WYSIWYG WYSIWYG that's a term that really has sort of fallen
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.760]  out of favor we don't really think about anymore what you see is what you get but
[25:02.760 --> 25:09.160]  Squarespace is like the epitome of WYSIWYG because when you're you're the
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.120]  owner of the website or you're just a rando visitor to the website you're
[25:14.120 --> 25:18.520]  looking at the same thing but when you're the administrator you have edit
[25:18.520 --> 25:21.920]  buttons where you can change things move things around but you do it all
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.280]  directly right on the website it is so great such a great place you can do
[25:27.280 --> 25:32.000]  everything from registering domain names to updating the site to designing the
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.800]  site all on Squarespace here's what you do to get started go to
[25:36.800 --> 25:42.400]  squarespace.com and remember this code talk show know the not the talk show
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.160]  just talk show t-a-l-k-s-h-o-w and when you check out you'll save ten percent
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.360]  off and that counts including up to a year you can just sign up for a year in
[25:52.360 --> 25:55.600]  advance that's like getting two months free it's amazing go to
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.840]  squarespace.com remember that code talk show go to squarespace.com slash talk
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.680]  show and you can get started but just remember that code talk show when you
[26:04.680 --> 26:09.680]  pay so one of the things I've been writing about lately and I think it ties
[26:09.680 --> 26:14.360]  into this and and it's this term it's like my obsession for the summer is
[26:14.360 --> 26:23.120]  non-consensual technology and started with the zoom thing right that wasn't
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.600]  this ridiculous this is I'd never heard of zoom before and this is one of those
[26:26.600 --> 26:33.280]  things where me working at home you know without any colleagues and every time I
[26:33.280 --> 26:39.240]  do talk to somebody it's either FaceTime or when I do a podcast at Skype zoom is
[26:39.240 --> 26:46.400]  apparently a very popular sort of virtual meeting software type thing you
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.600]  know and you know it's got a webcam you can look at it you know and and you can
[26:51.600 --> 26:54.960]  have a virtual meeting you could have eight people around the world you know
[26:54.960 --> 27:00.600]  and yeah there you go you're all looking at each other in this thing and you can
[27:00.600 --> 27:04.600]  talk to each other and share notes and whatever the hell else you do in a
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.880]  meeting you wouldn't know you wouldn't know right but the way that zoom had set
[27:09.880 --> 27:17.720]  this up is to me absolutely criminal I and I'm I mean this literally I don't
[27:17.720 --> 27:23.120]  think that it is literally against any particular like US federal law but it
[27:23.120 --> 27:29.160]  ought to be it ought to be against the law and in in terms of computer ethics
[27:29.160 --> 27:35.680]  it is absolutely criminal is that they set their software up such that when you
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.760]  install their software they'd ask for you know hey can we have administrator
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.520]  privileges or whatever and you say okay because this is what I need to do to
[27:43.520 --> 27:51.480]  install this and they installed a localhost web server that was set to
[27:51.480 --> 27:58.600]  launch whenever you logged in and it was outside the app bundle and the the thing
[27:58.600 --> 28:02.240]  that whatever whatever mechanism I don't know what mechanism they were using to
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.040]  make sure it launched whenever you logged in but whatever it was it was all
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.920]  outside the app bundle so even if you deleted the zoom app you're like I don't
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.400]  like this or I only installed it once because somebody told me I needed to
[28:15.400 --> 28:19.200]  have a meeting I don't really care for it I'm gonna delete it you delete the
[28:19.200 --> 28:26.760]  app you hit empty trash it's gone you could even restart your your your Mac
[28:26.760 --> 28:33.480]  unbeknownst to you innocent user of zoom even just one time this invisible web
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.220]  server is still running on your Mac which is insane absolutely insane
[28:38.220 --> 28:44.240]  especially if you deleted the app and if you're ever on a web page and the web
[28:44.240 --> 28:51.880]  page sends your computer on any web browser a URL like addressed with their
[28:51.880 --> 28:59.240]  custom zoom URL scheme it would go to the localhost running invisible web
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.840]  server that you didn't even know was there and it would download and
[29:03.840 --> 29:11.200]  reinstall the zoom client that you purposefully deleted and then open it up
[29:11.200 --> 29:19.800]  which all of what I just described is exactly what they designed it to do none
[29:19.800 --> 29:28.720]  of that is out of spec none of that is a bug none of that is is is a in error and
[29:28.720 --> 29:34.520]  guess what turns out they did have at least one bug that would allow somebody
[29:34.520 --> 29:40.640]  to completely denial of service your computer by sending an unending stream
[29:40.640 --> 29:46.920]  of requests for the zoom thing so you could load a web page just by going to a
[29:46.920 --> 29:51.760]  web page and if the web page decided you know to to attack your computer it would
[29:51.760 --> 29:56.120]  just send an unending number of requests for this and it would completely lock up
[29:56.120 --> 30:00.800]  your computer which it was clearly a bug and then there was some kind of way
[30:00.800 --> 30:04.560]  where they could turn the webcam on which of course is terrifying and is
[30:04.560 --> 30:10.840]  everybody's worst nightmare you know with webcams and and ties into the whole
[30:10.840 --> 30:13.920]  Joanna Stern piece from a couple of weeks ago about whether you should put a
[30:13.920 --> 30:18.080]  piece of tape over your webcam or not there was another bug where they could
[30:18.080 --> 30:23.160]  turn on your webcam without you knowing or requesting it or allowing it which is
[30:23.160 --> 30:31.120]  insane absolutely insane but the whole thing that the starting point of them
[30:31.120 --> 30:34.920]  doing something that you never permitted never would have permitted if they had
[30:34.920 --> 30:40.400]  asked for it is to me it gets to the bottom of what's wrong with the entire
[30:40.400 --> 30:47.760]  industry and and it's kind of it it makes me feel like a gray beard you know
[30:47.760 --> 30:54.680]  it's like I'm only 46 I'm not that old but I really feel like oh my god when
[30:54.680 --> 30:58.800]  when I got started really becoming a serious computer enthusiast and thought
[30:58.800 --> 31:02.800]  this is what I want to do with my life I want to get into this industry nobody
[31:02.800 --> 31:08.280]  would have ever done anything so contrary to the users wishes or best
[31:08.280 --> 31:17.560]  interests well not nobody maybe but nobody who was nobody who was selling a
[31:17.560 --> 31:21.240]  legitimate product right right right this kind of gets back to the such a
[31:21.240 --> 31:25.680]  perfect segue from the whole question of like can we look out after ourselves or
[31:25.680 --> 31:31.440]  not right like this is a great example zoom is again I'm very contrary to them
[31:31.440 --> 31:34.820]  I could not be more critical of them but their fundamental product is a real
[31:34.820 --> 31:39.480]  product that people use and it's a product that people use and they love it
[31:39.480 --> 31:43.400]  and I didn't know this either I had never heard of the company and I was
[31:43.400 --> 31:47.280]  discussing it with some folks kind of like well there's this little you know
[31:47.280 --> 31:52.720]  nobody heard of it nap that has this bug and everyone's like everyone was like
[31:52.720 --> 31:55.700]  what do you mean nobody's heard of it like everybody I want to tell a
[31:55.700 --> 32:01.160]  conference with uses this thing that's great that is totally me so I had the
[32:01.160 --> 32:05.760]  same experience but this is a perfect example who the heck thought that you
[32:05.760 --> 32:10.120]  download a teleconferencing app from a reputable quote-unquote seemingly
[32:10.120 --> 32:15.600]  presumably I should say reputable reputable software company and it would
[32:15.600 --> 32:21.360]  install a secret web server that makes you vulnerable to browser attacks and
[32:21.360 --> 32:27.840]  that's probably a perfect case in point for why we need like why is Apple doing
[32:27.840 --> 32:31.360]  all this to security junk well it's people doing stuff like this and I think
[32:31.360 --> 32:38.200]  your sort of broader point there though is correct that there seems to be you
[32:38.200 --> 32:42.800]  know and this extends way beyond the Mac this is um probably extends to like you
[32:42.800 --> 32:46.840]  know judging the ethics of companies like uber and you know people who have
[32:46.840 --> 32:50.240]  done things where you take a step back and you say well why the heck would
[32:50.240 --> 32:55.520]  anybody do that that's a violation of somebody's privacy or their you know
[32:55.520 --> 33:00.680]  their their rights whatever and it just seems like we're in one of these eras
[33:00.680 --> 33:08.440]  right now where it's very I think people are making a lot of excuses for doing
[33:08.440 --> 33:14.400]  things in the name of profit or what they think is yeah profit or even if it
[33:14.400 --> 33:18.520]  isn't profitable but they think it is right yeah and in this case I mean they
[33:18.520 --> 33:22.400]  had a not they said you know they had a pretty good case for making this for
[33:22.400 --> 33:29.320]  defending this as being driven by user experience right they said I think if I
[33:29.320 --> 33:32.600]  remember it correctly with the zoom thing it was like well this saves users
[33:32.600 --> 33:35.720]  a click so they could just automatically get connected and when that works
[33:35.720 --> 33:40.240]  customers are delighted because it saved them a click and if you can save
[33:40.240 --> 33:46.360]  customers a click without making them suddenly exposed to new vulnerabilities
[33:46.360 --> 33:50.400]  then what that's that is laudable and that's something you should be doing so
[33:50.400 --> 33:53.160]  it wasn't like in this case they were saying hey if we install this secret web
[33:53.160 --> 33:57.160]  server we can make a dollar extra for every customer they were saying well we
[33:57.160 --> 34:02.960]  can make a competitive advantage with it's sort of ties into Mars edit in a
[34:02.960 --> 34:09.080]  way because if if I've read the story correctly when they came up with this
[34:09.080 --> 34:15.240]  scheme to install the invisible web server behind the scenes so that you
[34:15.240 --> 34:21.480]  could click a button in a web page to say I want to talk to I want to talk to
[34:21.480 --> 34:27.720]  Daniel over zoom and it would download the client and install it and open it
[34:27.720 --> 34:31.440]  and then all of a sudden you know me and you were web chatting or whatever you
[34:31.440 --> 34:39.640]  want to call it it's yep if I'm reading it correctly it started when Safari was
[34:39.640 --> 34:50.000]  updated so that bookmarklets require user interaction yep and I forget the
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.120]  actual vulnerable but there was a real vulnerability that that was in response
[34:54.120 --> 35:03.760]  to where in other words I what does Mars edit use a Mars edit colon URL scheme is
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.400]  that what it is it does have that yeah so lots of apps have this sort of thing
[35:08.400 --> 35:14.160]  where where so for example Daniel's app Mars edit has a URL scheme and it starts
[35:14.160 --> 35:21.760]  instead of HTTP colon URL you know the rest of the URL goes here it's Mars edit
[35:21.760 --> 35:27.080]  colon and then there's you know like a command and then parameters so that you
[35:27.080 --> 35:34.000]  could open a new blog post with this as the title and this text as the body and
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.040]  you know there's a whole bunch of things you can do with it and all sorts of apps
[35:38.040 --> 35:45.480]  more apps than we could name have schemes like this so that you can click
[35:45.480 --> 35:52.760]  a link in you can make links in in email or text or wherever and you can create a
[35:52.760 --> 36:00.760]  new to do in things or other apps and all sorts of neat things you can do but
[36:00.760 --> 36:04.880]  the problem was is that they were being abused and there were ways that that
[36:04.880 --> 36:11.440]  certain websites were abusing this system and so Apple changed Safari so
[36:11.440 --> 36:19.520]  that whenever you open any URL who's the resolution of the URL is going to result
[36:19.520 --> 36:25.960]  in another app opening it would ask for confirmation in the Safari window and
[36:25.960 --> 36:37.120]  you have to click a button one button yep yeah isn't that bad but on the other
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.440]  hand if you're used to clicking no buttons it does seem yeah like oh this
[36:41.440 --> 36:48.360]  is annoying but it there there's sort of no middle ground where they they can't
[36:48.360 --> 36:54.080]  close the security hole that was opened by the fact that that it would
[36:54.080 --> 36:59.040]  automatically open these other apps without this and so in in response to
[36:59.040 --> 37:06.360]  this is why they started this but that's really the wrong way to go really yeah
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.240]  I mean that's really the most that's the most damning thing I think about the
[37:10.240 --> 37:15.600]  zoom incident was that when people broke it down they basically discovered that
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.680]  you know they're working around something that's specifically designed
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.000]  to get user consent back to what you were saying all right what was it what
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.760]  did you call it the non-consensual technology I really love and it applies
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.240]  to so many things that we've you know yeah so many of the last couple of years
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.560]  of of topics for podcasts and stuff it's so perfect non-consensual technology
[37:42.560 --> 37:48.240]  nobody maybe nobody said nobody said you know what I would like to have to make
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.640]  an extra click every time I start a zoom call nobody said that nobody wants that
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.960]  everybody would like it if if everybody played fair and nobody did anything
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.960]  dishonest everybody would like it if if you didn't have to make the extra click
[38:02.960 --> 38:09.880]  to make your zoom call but yep I think what it's sort of like saying wouldn't
[38:09.880 --> 38:13.400]  it be great if you could leave the doors of your house unlocked all the time and
[38:13.400 --> 38:17.400]  then even if you come home with two hands full of groceries you can just put
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.680]  your elbow on the doorknob and and come in the house wouldn't that be great it
[38:21.680 --> 38:25.840]  would be great but you can't leave your doors unlocked all the time because who
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.640]  knows who's gonna come in and jigger the door yeah right you know so you've got
[38:30.640 --> 38:34.560]  to lock the door and then once the doors locked you have to click the extra
[38:34.560 --> 38:40.600]  button to make a zoom call and they decided what you what they decided well
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.360]  wouldn't it be well how about once you let us in your house we'll unlock one of
[38:44.360 --> 38:51.560]  your windows without telling you and then if you ever need to make a zoom
[38:51.560 --> 38:57.520]  call we'll crawl in the window and open the door for you creepy it is not I
[38:57.520 --> 39:01.880]  don't think that's that much of a stretch as an analogy that they came in
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.780]  and unlocked you know window 80 right they put some toilet paper in the door
[39:06.780 --> 39:12.600]  lock thing just in case they needed to get it later but you know I think what
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.520]  you're getting at also points to a problem with Apple's approach to some of
[39:17.520 --> 39:22.280]  these security things is that I don't think Apple either they don't think
[39:22.280 --> 39:27.440]  through extensively enough what the usability implications are going to be
[39:27.440 --> 39:33.040]  or they don't consider them as important right so this whole thing with the you
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.680]  know you click on a lane custom link and now it prompts you the consent is
[39:38.680 --> 39:47.380]  important but I think most users agree that consent doesn't need to be in a lot
[39:47.380 --> 39:52.000]  of situations in life consent doesn't have to be granted explicitly every
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.920]  single time right right and so you click the link once that it says are you sure
[39:56.920 --> 40:01.240]  you want to open this zoom thing and then maybe if Apple had thought it
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.680]  through a little bit more maybe they'd realize how annoying this was going to
[40:03.680 --> 40:07.280]  be not just for zoom but for all this other software that uses this kind of
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.440]  solution for my bookmarklet for example and then maybe they are motivated then
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.560]  to engineer a solution that establishes a compromise where it's like you know
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.200]  what I pretty much know I trust whatever Mars Edit URLs are not dangerous to me
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.560]  right or they say you know what zoom URLs they seem like they could be
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.200]  dangerous so why don't you just only allow those to be opened from the zoom
[40:31.200 --> 40:36.720]  calm or whatever and I say this because you and I and you know this I mean I
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.480]  don't want to go too far into the weeds here but you and I have gone if it is
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.840]  absolutely my privilege that I know you and you're my friend but Mars Edit
[40:47.840 --> 40:54.520]  happens to be one of the very small handful of apps that I most rely on
[40:54.520 --> 41:00.560]  literally professionally I mean tens of thousands the overwhelming vast
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.960]  majority of posts to daring fireball over the last the entire history of the
[41:05.960 --> 41:12.720]  site frankly go through Mars Edit Mars Edit is I forget how long when did you
[41:12.720 --> 41:21.400]  take over Mars Edit 2007 yeah it's been 12 years believe it or not but it is 12
[41:21.400 --> 41:31.680]  years it is a blog editing app that speaks to any app that that uses any of
[41:31.680 --> 41:38.400]  the various open blog editing API's WordPress would be by far and away the
[41:38.400 --> 41:45.040]  most prevalent I still use movable type of movable type uses has a you know
[41:45.040 --> 41:50.880]  remote API that Mars Edit can speak to that's what I use it through but almost
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.760]  everything I post to daring fireball goes through Mars Edit and the only
[41:56.760 --> 42:00.280]  things that don't typically are like sometimes I'll make typo corrections
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.360]  from my phone going through the web interface but it's truly an essential
[42:04.360 --> 42:10.880]  part of my workflow I don't know what I would do without it but I also have and
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.000]  have had for years a bookmarklet that I use in Safari and so if I'm reading a
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.120]  web page you know could be from Bloomberg could be a New York Times
[42:21.120 --> 42:26.960]  doesn't matter what website it is I can click a button in Safari one button and
[42:26.960 --> 42:33.160]  then it jumps me into into Mars Edit it prefills the title with the title of the
[42:33.160 --> 42:39.200]  page that I was reading I can tweak it if I want it prefills the URL that I'm
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.640]  linking to and if I have a text selection in my browser window it
[42:43.640 --> 42:48.520]  prefills it as a block quote in in the window it's a really really nice
[42:48.520 --> 42:54.680]  convenient way to start the process of linking to a website and at some point
[42:54.680 --> 43:00.520]  about two years ago two three years ago when Apple changed this yeah where you
[43:00.520 --> 43:04.120]  had to click an extra button sure you want do you want to open this in Mars
[43:04.120 --> 43:08.200]  Edit I mean I do this a lot especially when I'm in the flow you know what I
[43:08.200 --> 43:11.720]  mean like on a good day when I'm really I you know maybe I've got a couple of
[43:11.720 --> 43:15.880]  things queued up to start the day and then I find a couple of more links
[43:15.880 --> 43:19.680]  during the day and I might have like seven or eight links the extra click
[43:19.680 --> 43:26.480]  really annoyed me and so you and I work this out and and I actually have a
[43:26.480 --> 43:36.360]  custom version of the app a post to Mars Edit app that does it exactly the way I
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.640]  want to but that it's super technical I mean most people can never do that right
[43:41.640 --> 43:50.720]  I mean I got like a weird a combination of me being half nerdy and especially
[43:50.720 --> 43:56.720]  being pals with you to get to get it set up just right I've got this custom app
[43:56.720 --> 44:02.640]  and on my site that the app literally doesn't do anything except offer Safari
[44:02.640 --> 44:08.360]  this extension which lets me get around the confirmation because I've okayed it
[44:08.360 --> 44:13.200]  once whereas and I think you're exactly right I kind it the whole thing would
[44:13.200 --> 44:20.040]  have been unnecessary if I could just tell Safari hey these Mars Edit colon
[44:20.040 --> 44:27.680]  URLs I'm okay with them do whatever they say or or maybe being able to permit on
[44:27.680 --> 44:33.120]  a bookmarklet by bookmarklet basis right so you make right right a bookmarklet
[44:33.120 --> 44:39.320]  you know I wrote this just trust me this is mine right right yeah there's lots of
[44:39.320 --> 44:42.840]  ways they could have made it easier and that's it's funny I don't I didn't I
[44:42.840 --> 44:45.520]  have to admit I didn't look into the zoom thing that carefully but it makes
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.520]  me wonder why didn't why weren't they able to they have a native app running I
[44:49.520 --> 44:54.040]  yes yeah well I think because I think the I think where they really crossed
[44:54.040 --> 44:59.560]  the line was where they decided that they would like to be able to reinstall
[44:59.560 --> 45:06.520]  themselves after being deleted and at that point you're you're in the dark
[45:06.520 --> 45:09.840]  world you know what I mean like that's wrong you know what I mean whereas I
[45:09.840 --> 45:13.960]  feel like if they were like as long as our app is still there there were a
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.000]  couple of ways that they could have gotten around this and made this more
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.740]  convenient I think the thing the the you know somewhere at some point they had a
[45:23.740 --> 45:27.440]  meeting where somebody wrote on the whiteboard reinstall after deleting the
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.920]  app and that's where they crossed the line right you have to admit though it's
[45:31.920 --> 45:34.800]  pretty convenient when they sneak back into your house and make you coffee the
[45:34.800 --> 45:43.520]  next morning I do I do I mean I'm a very offended by what they did but I kind of
[45:43.520 --> 45:54.960]  have to salute their like leaving behind a web server that's always running on
[45:54.960 --> 46:07.280]  port 80 that is sort of insane yeah that's I I condemn them for the morality
[46:07.280 --> 46:10.640]  of it yeah ethics of it whatever you want to call it but I kind of salute
[46:10.640 --> 46:20.840]  them for the balls yeah it's one of these things where it's like oh don't
[46:20.840 --> 46:24.560]  ever want like if somebody asked me now if I wanted to do a zoom conference call
[46:24.560 --> 46:28.960]  like I'm glad I'm on a position where people yeah I think I would actually say
[46:28.960 --> 46:34.120]  no you know yeah it's I I don't trust it that makes me think of Dropbox but let's
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.840]  hold that thought I'm gonna bring up this Dropbox stuff after I tell you
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.720]  about our next sponsor and it's another one of my good friends longtime sponsor
[46:43.720 --> 46:50.240]  of the show fracture look we all take hundreds probably thousands I don't know
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.880]  what the average is but I I probably average well over a thousand iPhone camera
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.920]  shots a year I've already taken hundreds of shots this summer from being on
[46:59.920 --> 47:06.640]  vacation I love using my iPhone as a camera it is absolute every year they
[47:06.640 --> 47:12.160]  get better and better but you know what it's it's not great only ever looking at
[47:12.160 --> 47:18.240]  your photos on a little 5-inch iPhone display even if you look at them on your
[47:18.240 --> 47:25.120]  iPad nice and big it's still not as great as actually printing the photos
[47:25.120 --> 47:29.440]  you really love the ones that are true keepers the ones where you capture your
[47:29.440 --> 47:35.840]  friends your kids your spouse your parents whoever you love and and they
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.120]  really look great or maybe it's not even people maybe it's just a sunset or
[47:40.120 --> 47:45.600]  something like that but just a great moment print it out and the best way to
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.280]  get your very favorite pictures print it out is on fracture fracture when you go
[47:51.280 --> 47:54.720]  there you upload your pictures they print them they don't put them on paper
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.280]  and then like tape them to a piece of glass they literally print the photos
[47:59.280 --> 48:05.760]  right on glass I don't know how they do it black magic I don't know but it
[48:05.760 --> 48:11.160]  really looks like they're printed right on the surface of the glass and they go
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.280]  edge to edge there is no corner there's no frame it's amazing and when they
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.600]  ship them to you they come with everything you could possibly need to
[48:21.600 --> 48:27.040]  hang them on the wall to prop them up on a mantle or on your desk if it's smaller
[48:27.040 --> 48:33.960]  everything you need is all right there in the case and they do it all right in
[48:33.960 --> 48:40.560]  Gainesville Florida with US source materials it is absolutely phenomenal
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.360]  print quality absolutely amazing when you look at them on your wall or on your
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.980]  desk they're truly the best way I know of to get your photos printed and they
[48:51.980 --> 48:56.940]  make amazing gifts they are the best gifts I have ever given to people in my
[48:56.940 --> 49:01.600]  family ever I just use them over and over and over and over again for gifts
[49:01.600 --> 49:05.720]  because that's one of the great things I'm a terrible gift giver because every
[49:05.720 --> 49:09.240]  once in a while I'll think of a good gift for somebody and then you give them
[49:09.240 --> 49:12.540]  the gift and then what do you do next what do you do next year if it's their
[49:12.540 --> 49:17.180]  birthday or it's Christmas or whatever fracture you can just keep giving it to
[49:17.180 --> 49:20.640]  them over and over and over again and never gets old because you never run out
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.440]  of new photos it's absolutely phenomenal gift I love their product we have them
[49:26.440 --> 49:30.760]  all over our house here's where you do to find out more go to fracture me.com
[49:30.760 --> 49:36.280]  or no just fracture dot me that's actually their domain name fracture dot
[49:36.280 --> 49:45.360]  me and just remember the code talk show and when they ask you where did you find
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.600]  out about fracture just remember to tell them you found out about it on this
[49:48.600 --> 49:54.040]  podcast I love fracture go check them out absolutely a phenomenal product
[49:54.040 --> 49:58.040]  they're another example of a company that's Gruber proof they've Gruber
[49:58.040 --> 50:06.480]  proofed their domain names you can go to either one fracture.me.com fracture.me doesn't
[50:06.480 --> 50:11.560]  matter you know my absolute favorite Gruber proof I can guess it I bet I can
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.840]  guess it all right what was it blackblaze.com
[50:17.360 --> 50:24.840]  so back wait what's the real company back blaze back blaze back blaze long
[50:24.840 --> 50:28.440]  time sponsor not a sponsor of this episode so this is totally unsolicited
[50:28.440 --> 50:37.600]  great online backup but I said their domain was black blaze and they went and
[50:37.600 --> 50:42.600]  and rather than like ask for a refund you know like hey yeah you screwed up
[50:42.600 --> 50:46.880]  our domain name you dumb shit you know and I would have I would have had no
[50:46.880 --> 50:49.440]  excuse I would have said here's your money back take your money back please
[50:49.440 --> 50:55.680]  you know I'm embarrassed instead they went and registered the domain black
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.360]  blaze still works I just did it it still works it's still work for life they're
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.160]  gonna have black blaze calm thanks to John Gruber it's one of my favorite
[51:05.160 --> 51:10.840]  stories of all time I screw up their domain they register an additional
[51:10.840 --> 51:14.440]  domain name they don't need and they're like oh no don't worry about it we
[51:14.440 --> 51:25.800]  thought it was funny Dropbox oh my god how about these clowns yeah right we
[51:25.800 --> 51:31.600]  were talking about consent right oh my god here's another one where for years I
[51:31.600 --> 51:39.400]  forget how long Dropbox has been around but it's at least 2009 2010 I know that
[51:39.400 --> 51:42.720]  it's Steve Jobs is still around because there's the famous story where Steve
[51:42.720 --> 51:46.920]  Jobs was talking to one of their founders and there was I guess some sort
[51:46.920 --> 51:51.400]  of you know just putting feelers out about whether they would be open to
[51:51.400 --> 51:57.680]  being acquired and and Jobs's line was hey you're not an app you're a feature
[51:57.680 --> 52:01.200]  yeah and that was his way of sort of trying to put him in their place
[52:01.200 --> 52:09.600]  whatever but but that at least puts the timeline at 2010 or 2009 or so I mean
[52:09.600 --> 52:16.800]  it's at least 10 years of Dropbox yep and within the last week or two they've
[52:16.800 --> 52:23.160]  issued an update and a couple of things number one their software their app on
[52:23.160 --> 52:29.640]  the Mac updates itself on its own schedule without you know you you grant
[52:29.640 --> 52:33.520]  it permission when you first install it and then it's there running in the
[52:33.520 --> 52:39.680]  background and it updates itself and they they've updated it to a version
[52:39.680 --> 52:46.120]  that launches an app in your dock which a lot of I I've got enough stuff in my
[52:46.120 --> 52:53.240]  dock where one more thing doesn't really annoy me but I'm totally totally 100%
[52:53.240 --> 53:01.400]  attuned to the dock perfectionists who don't want anything in their dock that
[53:01.400 --> 53:08.920]  they don't want and I totally understand how an awful lot of third-party utility
[53:08.920 --> 53:14.600]  Mac software specifically has even however minimal their preferences are
[53:14.600 --> 53:19.480]  they have a preference for show doc icon you know that some people really don't
[53:19.480 --> 53:23.400]  want stuff in the dock even if it's running all the time they really don't
[53:23.400 --> 53:29.080]  want it there unless it's like an app that they actually look at right if it's
[53:29.080 --> 53:32.680]  not an app with the windows that you look at they don't want it in their dock
[53:32.680 --> 53:38.480]  I totally get that you know I don't want I generally don't want extra things in
[53:38.480 --> 53:45.280]  my dock but now Dropbox has this icon in the dock and you click it and it's it's
[53:45.280 --> 53:53.080]  ugly what what you do see when you click it is ugly and nobody it nobody who I
[53:53.080 --> 54:00.800]  know wants anything other than a folder that sinks and you know with sharing
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.680]  that's what Dropbox is and and the the whole Steve Jobs hey you're a feature
[54:05.680 --> 54:11.640]  not an app or whatever it's like yeah but you're a feature I would pay for I
[54:11.640 --> 54:17.680]  a folder that sinks with sharing I would pay for that I would happily pay for
[54:17.680 --> 54:24.240]  that as long as it's super robust and super reliable which Dropbox sinking
[54:24.240 --> 54:30.480]  wise has always been that was always the miracle of Dropbox right that that you
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.480]  know in an era when there were multiple I've always been multiple options of
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.240]  ways to try to have a shared folder between computers Dropbox was like the
[54:40.240 --> 54:46.640]  first one who just said just install this thing give it permissions and let
[54:46.640 --> 54:52.040]  it go and every computer you have this on will have the exact same shit in the
[54:52.040 --> 54:58.840]  exact same folder and that was amazing it was absolutely amazing and it didn't
[54:58.840 --> 55:06.000]  matter like if you like were temporarily offline you're out in the middle of you
[55:06.000 --> 55:12.760]  know a prairie you're you're a 500 miles away from the nearest cell tower but you
[55:12.760 --> 55:17.440]  open your laptop and you do a little work and you hit command s and you save
[55:17.440 --> 55:23.080]  a file and you close your laptop and at some point your laptop reconnects to the
[55:23.080 --> 55:29.080]  internet and it sinks and everything you know then you go back home and you open
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.920]  up your desktop iMac and there it is there's the file that you had saved in
[55:33.920 --> 55:39.520]  the middle of Kansas 500 miles from the nearest cell tower and it's all there
[55:39.520 --> 55:46.440]  right it really has been sink wise one of the great technology triumphs of the
[55:46.440 --> 55:51.280]  world and it sounds like something that should not be celebrated but anybody
[55:51.280 --> 55:58.080]  who's ever worked on anything that sinks period realizes what a triumph Dropbox
[55:58.080 --> 56:03.720]  has always been from the day one you know technology wise yeah it's reminding
[56:03.720 --> 56:08.720]  me of the sort of famous Quora question you remember this like it was like this
[56:08.720 --> 56:12.720]  this answer to a Quora question kind of got some traction I'm looking at it
[56:12.720 --> 56:19.200]  right now cuz I was reminded of it and it's from 2011 but it's an answer to a
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.040]  question is which is basically like why is Dropbox successful like why why why
[56:25.040 --> 56:29.760]  why is it successful and there's so many other tools and that's great this great
[56:29.760 --> 56:35.120]  response by Michael Wolff and you've probably if you don't remember already
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.800]  off the top of your head you probably remember it when I read it but he says
[56:37.800 --> 56:41.960]  like basically he says well let's take a step back and think about the sink
[56:41.960 --> 56:47.200]  problem and what the ideal solution for it would do one there would be a folder
[56:47.200 --> 56:53.080]  two you'd put your stuff in it three it would sink and then he says they built
[56:53.080 --> 56:59.280]  that and he says why didn't anyone else build that I have no idea but that's the
[56:59.280 --> 57:04.440]  nut of what you're saying is the simplicity is what we've come you know
[57:04.440 --> 57:07.240]  people who use draw I don't use Dropbox regularly anymore I think I kind of got
[57:07.240 --> 57:14.920]  the whiff of something up a few years ago and so I uninstalled the the Dropbox
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.360]  system level integration a few years ago when they had I don't remember or
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.480]  something they did something kind of kind of silly a few years ago no they
[57:23.480 --> 57:27.240]  started I I know exactly I I guarantee you I know when you did it it was yeah
[57:27.240 --> 57:33.000]  and they started asking for permission that would allow them they didn't tell
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.920]  you this but they were asking for permission so that what they could do is
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.000]  install a kernel extension right which is fucked up right I mean that is
[57:41.000 --> 57:47.320]  seriously you know it two three four years ago kernel extensions were already
[57:47.320 --> 57:53.580]  like hey we don't live in the 90s anymore you don't just apps don't get to
[57:53.580 --> 57:59.280]  install right shit that runs okay not for not for a you know file sync not for
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.960]  something that we know could work without it right that was the thing is
[58:02.960 --> 58:07.440]  we know that everything I want out of Dropbox I know can run without it
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.600]  because I never let you do it before and you're doing what I want you to do which
[58:12.600 --> 58:18.040]  is give me a folder and it syncs and it's perfect why in the world should I
[58:18.040 --> 58:23.440]  give you kernel access so I you were probably smart I I've I still run it but
[58:23.440 --> 58:28.920]  now at this point I I'm it's like on my summer list of to do's I've got to get
[58:28.920 --> 58:35.720]  out of it because the I think it's coincidental timing because I don't
[58:35.720 --> 58:39.520]  think I think that you know they're they're their aspirations are high
[58:39.520 --> 58:46.040]  enough that it's not tied to the fact that 1015 Catalina is going to add
[58:46.040 --> 58:53.160]  shared folders to iCloud file sharing or file syncing whatever but the having a
[58:53.160 --> 58:58.400]  shared folder is the last thing keeping me on Dropbox and and specifically I
[58:58.400 --> 59:03.520]  only share it with one person the only one that really matters to me I guess I
[59:03.520 --> 59:07.520]  have one with my wife and we update it every once in a while but for the most
[59:07.520 --> 59:12.640]  part with my wife we we just send stuff by iMessage but the big one for me is
[59:12.640 --> 59:18.880]  for this show where I finish the show I'm going to send you a link and you'll
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.760]  upload your end of the audio I'm gonna upload upload my end of the audio and
[59:23.760 --> 59:30.640]  then Caleb Sexton who edits the show is also a member of the same shared folder
[59:30.640 --> 59:34.200]  he'll get both files and then he'll be able to edit them and when he's done
[59:34.200 --> 59:39.280]  editing he will put the final version of the show in the same folder and then
[59:39.280 --> 59:43.400]  I'll pull it down so I have one shared folder that I really care about with
[59:43.400 --> 59:49.880]  Caleb I share it with everybody who's on my show once I can get rid of it but I
[59:49.880 --> 59:55.840]  think I could do that without running Dropbox locally like one of the things
[59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.920]  that's most appealing to me about unappeal uninstalling Dropbox is that I
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:09.080]  could use like transit from panic and just give transit my Dropbox credentials
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:15.040]  and just treat it the way I treat most remote locations and do it through
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.920]  instead of through the finder and make it seem like it's a local folder that's
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.200]  on my file system I don't really need that I just need the shared folder with
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.800]  collaborators I could do that through an app and not have it seem like it's part
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.560]  of my file system right that's funny I know that I know I used to run Dropbox
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.440]  because I used to since you mentioned that shared folder it's also evidence
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.320]  that I have in fact been on the show before because I just went to Dropbox
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.920]  calm and I'm in that shared folder for the talk show and I used to get these
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.320]  great notifications that would let me know in advance who I could expect to
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.920]  see here on the show because Mac OS would say hey so so and so just
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.440]  uploaded some files to this shared Dropbox folder so I guess I lost that
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:07.480]  feature when I uninstalled Dropbox but maybe that's a reason enough to get back
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:14.320]  into the Dropbox culture here but yeah that's um that's a mess it's it's a
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.240]  horrible thing for a company like Dropbox which I think you would agree
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:24.000]  Dropbox had a lot of sort of it's more than just brand equity they had sort of
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.520]  like it because of their simplicity and the fact that it just worked they sort
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:34.480]  of had like an engineering level nerd equity yes I know exactly what you mean
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.560]  right and yeah it's like you kind of trust some companies not just from a
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.560]  branding point of view but from like they know how to do this right point of
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:46.840]  view well and and that people who knew their shit were like yeah yeah I use
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.680]  Dropbox yeah I mean you know it's like back in the day when I was doing graphic
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:02:00.000]  design it's like you know illustrator and freehand were arch rivals and
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.120]  people who knew their shit would have everybody had a strong preference as to
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.320]  which was your favorite vector illustration tool but everybody who knew
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.840]  anything would acknowledge that both of them were completely credible tools they
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.440]  just did it in different ways right you know it's you know there's just a whole
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.880]  list of apps in various you know you name the field and people who know their
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:35.280]  shit will be like hey I use blank but I know that X Y & Z are also good they're
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.960]  just not the ones I use but that's my short list you know X Y Z & W they're
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.280]  they're the ones that I think are the ones you should look at and Dropbox was
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.240]  absolutely not a number one on that list of hey if you want a folder that sinks
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:59.160]  you should install Dropbox and it's just a shame and I don't it's like that I get
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.400]  that their executive staff right now is in the tough spot because they raised a
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.400]  gazillion dollars in venture capital with the idea that they would eventually
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:18.120]  be valued at ten gazillion dollars and to get from here to there they have to
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:25.040]  try to do something else you know that that just selling a utility that lets a
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.680]  folder sink for five dollars a month whatever isn't gonna get them there but
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:38.440]  it it could in theory be a good business right it just wouldn't be a you know
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.640]  you're up there with Microsoft and Facebook and Apple and Google as one of
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:48.600]  the giant titans of the stock market type business but that's but they raised
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.840]  money thinking that that's what they would do you know and I get it that now
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.600]  they're painted in a corner because they've raised all this money on the
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.560]  idea that they're going to be the next Microsoft Office 365 and so they've got
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.600]  to sell you know they're turning the client software into this thing that
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:13.120]  does everything from document sharing to video conferencing to whatever the fuck
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.320]  else it does I I get that they're painted in a corner because they did it
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.680]  but nobody forced them to paint themselves in the corner you know and and
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.120]  it could have been a very nice business you know it could have just been I don't
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.160]  know you know how many people I would support I don't know how big the company
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.680]  would be but in theory with the technology they had and the sync
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:38.920]  algorithm they had which clearly it truly it sounds like something that
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.920]  everybody should have and that and that it should be like bubble sort you know I
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.800]  mean like here's one of these algorithms that everybody knows and and you know it
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:53.360]  it works with this performance and everybody you know can use this
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.800]  algorithm to sync between things the truth is sync is incredibly hard it's
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:06.440]  incredibly hard it's incredibly prone to bugs and and from day one Dropbox sync
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:13.320]  was fast and reliable and and that's all you could ever ask for it was rare at
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.000]  the time they should have been able to build some sort of business around it
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.040]  even if it was a million dollar business instead of a billion dollar business but
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.320]  instead because they're going for a billion dollar business now we've got
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:31.160]  shit we got a big big pile of dog shit right there everybody's front door who
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.840]  runs runs Dropbox so interesting the valuations as soon as you started
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.880]  talking about the size of the company and their ambitions I punched it into
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.720]  Yahoo stocks thing you know and Dropbox as of today is a market cap 10 billion
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.360]  dollar company which is incredible a huge number unless you compare to like
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.520]  all these other companies so for instance it's like a half of a lift or
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:05.560]  one third one third of a Twitter which I mean Twitter seems small its valuation
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:11.600]  seems small 28.8 billion right now it seems small compared to its mind share
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.400]  right right right I actually think Twitter is undervalued mm-hmm in my
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.200]  opinion just because there's there there I don't want to go off too much on a
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.880]  tangent on this but there are still so much in the shadow of Facebook and
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:31.040]  therefore still compared on Facebook's terms and Facebook is the one who
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:38.480]  defined monthly active users as this like that's the benchmark yeah and it's
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:45.960]  such the wrong yardstick for Twitter right it's so it is so inappropriate for
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:52.680]  Twitter but it is in every single way it's it defines every single bad idea
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:57.400]  Twitter comes up with for the last six seven years because they know they're
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:04.640]  being measured against Facebook's definition of terms and I think Facebook
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:10.000]  I think Facebook I hate them I've never signed up for Facebook I think they're
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.920]  genuinely a bad effect on humanity overall planet wise but I do think that
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.320]  they are very I think they're you know from Zuckerberg down they're run by very
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:30.200]  smart people and I think that they they not only set up that as their yardstick
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.160]  too because it would make them look good I think they very deliberately chose it
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.800]  because they knew it would make their competitors look bad that no one would
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:46.840]  be able to you know once they they took the mental real estate that they did in
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:55.520]  people's lives as this is where regular people share photos and anecdotes about
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.720]  their lives they knew that nobody else would be able to occupy that and no one
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.640]  would be able to compare with them on monthly active users and they sort of
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:08.560]  got this entrenched in the minds of investors as monthly active users equals
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:15.960]  you know measuring stick III you know it's part of the evil of Facebook is
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.600]  that they they not only do bad things but they actually entrench a bad
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:29.680]  measuring stick as as the the measuring for other social networks yeah 20 20
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:37.600]  times Twitter is 20 times smaller market cap than Facebook but such such a larger
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.560]  mind share not so much larger and and you know I don't watch a lot of cable
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.600]  news you know I you know I mean I don't care what your political persuasion is
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.120]  whether you're a conservative or liberal or in-between or whatever cable news
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.920]  will rot your brain no matter which network you watch yes it's not good now
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.360]  but when I do watch because you know there's some breaking news I guess this
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:07.000]  week I'll probably watch because Robert Miller is gonna you know
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.720]  testify before Congress so I'll be watching some cable news this week but
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.580]  whenever I do you can't go more than six or seven minutes before you see
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:20.520]  something about it a tweet yeah whether it's right it's not just the president
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.440]  you know it's it's people from Congress it's you know AOC you know she's
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.280]  absolutely amazing on Twitter she's you know she's as much a master of Twitter
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:37.320]  as the president is and it's a fantastic way to control her message it's but the
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:44.600]  the degree to which Twitter has become the platform for people like that you
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.740]  know who are the absolute you know truly the leaders of our country to to
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.640]  communicate with us it's truly phenomenal and it's completely
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:10:00.720]  completely non-valued in Twitter's valuation absolute and which is to me
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:05.640]  ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous yeah fat it's fascinating so anyway I
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.000]  don't want to like you say let's not get on it I'll sit here and look at stock
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.480]  prices all day and make analyses of what's valued right and wrong but I just
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.480]  think that's it's just fascinating in Dropbox clearly a huge company but they
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.600]  it is a transition getting back to the sort of topic at hand like Dropbox is a
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.560]  great example of one of these companies that has kind of gone from like I said
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:34.640]  that kind of nerd credibility to what's what's left nobody you turn on any
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.920]  podcast they're all talking about nerd warnings right yeah yeah right it's gone
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:44.920]  from like nerd like hey you should install Dropbox it's awesome to hey do
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:51.040]  you have Dropbox installed you should maybe yeah yeah which is it's sad very
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:56.920]  sad because the actual technology that made us fall in love with it is still
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:04.120]  there that's that's the tragedy and it I again there's far worse tragedies in the
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:10.720]  world but right to me having great technology just get obfuscated with
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:20.080]  piles and piles of crap in front of it is sort of heartbreak yep sure is looks
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.880]  like it's gonna thunderstorm here how's the weather up there I got my windows
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.520]  closed so I don't have the and I have my AC off so I'm moving in a little like
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.360]  sealed vacuum chamber here but looking at my window I think I don't think we
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.280]  have it come in real soon but I think there's something on the forecast yeah
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:43.640]  are you are you an ocean guy I know I've been listening to the ATP and yeah our
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.600]  friend Marco Arment is right this one this summer and our other friend John
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:55.360]  Sirk use a big big big fan of going to the beach long time you know hello yeah
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.240]  everybody's waiting for him to drop a camera in the ocean right yes you know
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.480]  that's that's like the annual tradition he wades into the ocean with a
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.280]  handheld camera takes pictures of his kids and his wife and whoever else he's
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.760]  at the shore with still hasn't lost one but our friend Marco is learning to swim
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.000]  gonna go deeper in the ocean are you are you an ocean guy I'm a I grew up in
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.920]  Santa Cruz California so which is funny because that's not an automatic
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:27.800]  qualifier for being an ocean guy by stark contrast to what I'm about to say
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.760]  I have never actually surfed which is you know kind of supposed to do but I
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.640]  did spend plenty of time in the ocean so that like the kinds of things they're
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.760]  talking about on ATP I can relate to very well you know I know how to dive
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.600]  under a wave I know how to dive over a wave I know how to swim against the you
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.200]  know against the tide if you need to and it's fun it is fun listening to that
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.780]  conversation in part because I love John I love how much he always surprises me
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.080]  with how with his extracurricular interests that I would have never
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.200]  guessed and so the picture I would have never thought he was as much of a beach
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:13.360]  guy well right yeah just a beach guy in general but then the particular thing
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.760]  that I've now got like a picture in my mind of just just enter this meditation
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.040]  with me everybody you're looking at is a beautiful blue sky the waves are
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.960]  crashing on the sand you're sitting you know cross-legged on a beach looking out
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:34.040]  at the horizon and then a wave is coming in and what's that it's John Syracuse
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:40.240]  body surfing and he's like of course you can catch a wave anybody can catch a
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.440]  wave you just gotta try a few times right and they're like okay I love the
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.000]  picture because I could also picture we've also you know we've all seen you
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.400]  know John doesn't get excited about everything in this world but when he
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.180]  gets excited you see that great big smile and I'm just picturing that great
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:04.520]  big John Syracuse a smile coming in on a wave as I'm sitting on the beach I
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:10.120]  never would have guessed that he was experienced and adept at body surfing so
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.320]  that's my my ATP I I can tell you the only time I've ever seen him happy it
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:25.360]  was the the WWDC where they announced a PFS and then afterwards I met him you
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.360]  know it was like I don't know 15 minutes after the the keynote ended and I was
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:38.560]  outside and there he was and it he truly looked happy for his beaming huh yeah I
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:45.240]  here's the thing I I grew up my family we used to always go to the Jersey Shore
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.560]  you know my parents are not really you know they're not world travelers they
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.080]  they my dad likes to go places he can drive so we were always Jersey Shore
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:02.000]  people I liked it but my thing was never the daytime at the beach I was never a
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:10.440]  fan you know you get a little chafing Jersey Shore sand is a bit course I was
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.080]  always a fan of the the boardwalk at night you know I like it at night when
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.480]  the lights are on you know hey you know I like a casino you know I'm a late
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.240]  night person I was always the late night kid I like I like the action late at
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:30.680]  night I like the lights I like the dark I like the seediness and then you know
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:39.000]  now that I've traveled a bit and I've been to the Caribbean a few times that's
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.320]  that's the fucking beach I'm holy shit man the sand I mean even just the sand
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:51.000]  is better the sand is better the ocean is clear you can actually see your feet
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.640]  at the bottom of the ocean the waves instead of knocking you over are just
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.720]  gentle they're just you know a little up little down little up little down the
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.520]  Atlantic Ocean in like New Jersey Long Island New York that type of area it's
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:13.400]  it's brutal it in and it's ugly it's it's you know it's it's dark brown water
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.320]  you can't see six inches into it it's it's kind of filthy if you turn your
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.720]  back on a wave it'll knock you over you know what I mean like you can't turn
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.840]  your back on a wave you know it's it's yeah so I you know I'm kind of anti
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:33.200]  Atlantic Ocean to be honest I like I like being in the ocean I like a beach
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.920]  but I'll tell you what I don't like the the eastern seaboard the eastern
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.080]  seaboard is shit in my opinion and I'm a type of person who's biased in terms of
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.160]  the East Coast I think the East Coast is the real time zone I think you know I
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:53.760]  have all sorts of biases in favor of the Eastern Standard time zone but I'll tell
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.800]  you what in terms of going to the beach it's the fucking worst I think you can
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.920]  just expand that all your biases against the Eastern the Atlantic Eastern you
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.200]  know coast of the u.s. I think you can just expand that to include the Western
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:13.320]  Coast because it's just you know you can't see through it it's now cold it's
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:19.360]  colder than the Atlantic and it's more forceful and more violent so if it's in
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:25.120]  a way I mean you really can't turn your back on the Pacific I enjoy that I still
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:30.400]  I enjoy the big waves I enjoy you know I related I think most to actually John's
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.720]  advice to Marco because you know folks we haven't heard it you should go listen
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.320]  to it but basically Marco's like I don't know what I want I don't I don't know
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.920]  what to do in the water it doesn't doesn't seem fun to just like frolic
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.160]  around in the water and John's saying basically well you know it's like a
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:49.760]  video game of like you versus the waves and I relate to that because that was
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.400]  one of my fun pastimes you never know what the next wave is gonna be and
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.980]  especially on the in the Pacific Santa Cruz where I grew up you can get some
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.920]  big waves and they will really knock you out and you know one of one of the bits
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.520]  of advice also John had for Marco was to learn to hold his breath right and I
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.440]  think it's hard to have a sense of time when you're trapped underwater from a
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.280]  wave but I think I've probably been trapped underwater for at least 30
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.000]  seconds which is terrifying right when you don't know how long you're gonna be
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.240]  underwater right but that's you know it's kind of it's kind of one of these
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.820]  things the ocean is one of these things I think at its best can kind of wake you
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:36.400]  up to the fact that the world is so big and so powerful and so much bigger than
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.720]  any one of us I think that's probably kind of the high that surfers get is
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.520]  kind of being part of this system that's bigger than them but I don't know it's
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.480]  interesting I I definitely like the ocean but these days my family and I we
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.640]  usually go to Cape Cod the oceans ruined in Cape Cod because of all the of all
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:03.880]  the great white sharks so that sounds exciting though it's exciting yeah it is
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.280]  exciting for sure I shouldn't say it's ruined but I mean it's getting more and
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.760]  more it's like seems like every year there's like a there's like a more I
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:19.540]  would go in that water I would go in I cannot even imagine convincing either my
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:25.560]  son Jonas or my wife Amy to go in the water if there was even a 1% chance of a
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.860]  great white shark I can't even imagine getting them to going up to their
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:33.720]  ankles it's getting it's getting to the point where like the part of Cape Cod we
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:39.600]  go to they might as well film a Jaws sequel there because it's like it's like
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:45.240]  it's right it's ready for blood on the beach you know it's it's kind of I mean
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.320]  it's I don't want to trivialize it too but it is kind of fun and exciting
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:54.600]  obviously it's not fun and exciting if anything happens but it's it's scary and
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.440]  it's I remember the first time I came out to the cuz I growing up on the West
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.260]  Coast I didn't get out to the East Coast at all until I was an adult actually the
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:10.000]  first time on the East Coast was an iconic moment in history Mac world 1996
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:18.800]  oh wow yeah and Apple it was my first paid was it 96 or 97 it's the one with
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.240]  with um where Bill Gates made the announcement that's 97 that's 97 yeah
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.320]  that makes more sense cuz I was hired in 96 and then the next Mac world in Boston
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:34.480]  Apple sent me out and that was also my first experience going to an Atlantic
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:41.080]  Beach and cuz this was great this was back when Apple like they just like they
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.800]  gave me a rental car they you know they said take a few extra days whatever and
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.040]  I went down to Cape Cod for the first time and I was just like this is like
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.440]  this is like a playground compared to the Pacific but at that time there
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.800]  weren't like a huge risk of sharks every day well the thing about the Atlantic is
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:05.680]  and I I have to admit I've never been in the Pacific Ocean I've obviously been to
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.480]  California many times but I've never gone to the beach but I mean I've seen
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:15.360]  it but the thing about the Atlantic Ocean especially on the New Jersey New
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.240]  York and I you know I've been to South Carolina and it's exactly the same so
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.440]  South Carolina to me I don't know I'm just gonna draw a line and say all the
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.040]  way from South Carolina to New York it's all the same it's dark water it's dirty
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:37.080]  and the waves break really close to the shore so you can't surf there is I know
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.960]  that there are people who surf in New Jersey don't don't don't I get it but
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.320]  you have to hunt for it because for the most part of most beaches the waves all
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:54.680]  break like 20 feet from the shore it's it it's terrible yeah I have been
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:58.000]  confused wondering where people surf because I see you I go to Cape Cod
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.840]  there's like surf shops and they have surfboards and I wonder when I was in
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:09.440]  high school my best friend his mom always got a rented a house for a week
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:16.240]  or two and on Long Beach Island in New Jersey and Long Beach Island is is
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:24.360]  really nice it's it's if if I were ever going to spend more than a week at the
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.720]  shore that's probably where I would go you know it's really nice it's a very
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.520]  narrow town so like the furthest you can get from the beach is like two blocks
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.140]  from the beach you know it's and it's a very short beach so once you're on the
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.680]  beach you're almost in the water very nice and and you could surf there and I
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:50.440]  could see guys surfing there but even so it it really seemed constrained you know
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.920]  like you were you were the the guys who were surfing were clearly it it was hard
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.640]  to surf you know I mean because you the waves broke too close to the shore
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:05.920]  they're you can do it but it it didn't look anything like when you watch real
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.960]  surfers you know pro pro surfers on ESPN and they're you know in Hawaii or you
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:15.240]  know somewhere cool in California and they're way off the coast and they can
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:19.760]  like ride this wave you know for a minute or something like that no way you
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.820]  get like two seconds on a fucking wave in New Jersey it's right that's the
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:27.680]  serious waves in California and Hawaii they have people like and they have
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.400]  those contests competitions they have jet skis to like shuttle the surfers out
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.600]  it's like that's how far out they have to get to actually catch those waves do
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.340]  you ever think about the stupid stuff you did as a kid did you I mean I did a
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.780]  lot of stupid stuff that if I found out my kid was doing I I would want to
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:50.420]  strangle him did you just dumb stuff like that I did all the dumb stuff and
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:55.340]  it's just too sad that my I'm never gonna let my kids get away with it so
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:59.720]  when I was in high school at my best friend is like I said his mom would rent
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:04.320]  a house for two weeks in Long Beach Island and then like for a week for a
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:08.240]  couple of years he invited me out and then by like my senior year we had a
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:13.520]  couple of friends who would come out and spend a week there and it was really
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:18.800]  cool and it was you know a lot of fun just you know be on your own in a beach
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:24.440]  town his mom was very cool very nice but the one year I think it was the year
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:29.400]  before my senior year high school a hurricane came through and and it didn't
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:34.600]  really hit the Jersey Shore very hard you know somebody can look you know
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.520]  Google this up summer of 91 it would have been there was a hurricane and it
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.520]  must have hit one of the Carolinas real hard but then it came up the eastern
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.280]  seaboard and it was just like a tropical storm by the time it hit New Jersey but
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.840]  the other thing we were obsessed with at the time was playing poker we played
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:59.280]  poker and we played all night long and we watched the storm just blow and it
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.440]  was just random shit just you'd look out we were playing on the porch and it was
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:10.640]  like in an enclosed porch and it was just the most amazing thing because you
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.640]  would see things that you wouldn't think the wind could blow just blowing down
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.680]  the street you know like a big heavy metal wrought iron bench right blowing
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:27.120]  down the street we stayed up all night playing poker crazy storm got a couple
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:33.120]  hours of sleep woke up and we went down to the beach and it the beach it wasn't
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.880]  raining but it was overcast it was the day after the storm had come through but
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:42.440]  because it was overcast like the the lifeguards were not on duty and nobody
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.960]  was on the beach there was nobody on the beach it was just like me and like three
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:52.800]  friends and you know it was the middle of summer it wasn't cold but the water
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.400]  was a little cold but we decided to go in and and the day after this storm I
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.600]  mean the waves were like epic I mean they were like I mean they were just I
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:07.240]  I've never ever in my life seen waves like this maybe in the Pacific you see
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:11.440]  waves like this all the time but they were just humongous but my friend Todd
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:19.240]  just like went way out in the ocean I mean like so far it was crazy oh boy and
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.080]  these waves were like 20 to 30 foot swells and and you would see him at the
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.480]  top of one and you know just see his head sticking out and then he would go
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:34.600]  down and we're yelling and and even us as idiot 17 year old boys who thought
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.320]  we were gonna live forever we're we were even we were yelling at him like hey
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.520]  dude you might want to come in there's literally no lifeguards on duty no
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.440]  lifeguards nobody else of course it's you know 1991 it's all pre cell phone so
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.480]  he had like washed out to see we I mean he'd be dead and we were just vaguely
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.360]  concerned we were just like and meanwhile we were all probably way too
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.280]  far out right like cuz the waves it was just so much fun going up and down if I
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.560]  found out my kid went in the ocean the day after a hurricane or a tropical
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:12.920]  storm came by without lifeguards I would strangle him oh my god but at the time I
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.860]  thought that was normal I was like well at least I'm not Todd I'm not the one
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:21.080]  I'm not the one who's 40 yards out I keep telling my kids about my childhood
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.720]  experiences and I have to sort of say like well I'm not gonna let you do this
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.820]  but this is and it's like similar similar to that we were just like I said
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:34.680]  I was up in Vermont and you know sitting in this river and it was a very calm
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.280]  tepid River on but I told my my kids about how I used to ride the inner tubes
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.620]  down the Sacramento River in California and this is a river that has some like
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:51.740]  some some rapids and the key though is I used to ride this inner tube down the
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:57.440]  river and this the town I lived in as a seven-year-old with my seven-year-old
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.680]  friend and no adults we just go get these tubes and we'd hop we take like a
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.120]  hike like a mile up the river and then hop in the river and I just can't
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.360]  fathom it my son my seven-year-old doesn't even walk doesn't even cross the
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:23.560]  street without me so I don't know it's um I kind of fear that I'm gonna make
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.880]  these kids that don't have like the independence and you know adventure
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.360]  spirit that in some ways I have but I don't want to be like one of those
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.120]  people who's like confirmation bias just because I survived every other kid is
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.520]  gonna survive the same freedom like I think it's one of those things where
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.200]  because I did end up surviving and things turned out okay it kind of makes
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:52.600]  a great story and it makes me have some attributes that I value but that doesn't
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:57.460]  mean I should take the same chance with my kids well here's my favorite my
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:02.240]  favorite was my parents house is a right across the street from the elementary
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.960]  school that I went to literally right across the street and it it's on the
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:12.880]  hill so you could go down the hill and you know I used to ride a skateboard you
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.520]  could go down the hill on the skateboard right in front of the school and then
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.080]  you'd you'd make a right into the parking lot of the school and then you
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.160]  you know you could smooth out the downhill thing you did and they also had
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.520]  a pavilion now the pavilion is gone now you know but that the you know that I
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:35.280]  think they like expanded the school to cover it but next to this covered
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:40.080]  pavilion there was just a little hump maybe like six six inches like where the
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.960]  they they just they didn't know what to do with the end of the macadam so they
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:48.760]  just curled it up but if you if you hit it on your bike it was a nice little
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.500]  jump you could you know you could easily get three four feet up in the air we
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:56.240]  should call it the hump jump mm-hmm and the one time I was there I had no
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:01.600]  friends with me I was all by myself and I hit the hump jump and I really hit it
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.800]  fast and I was going for distance but there happened to be a tree about 15
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:15.280]  feet away from it oh my I hit the tree like with my bike it's so hard that it
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.880]  turned the handlebars of my bike completely perpendicular so that the
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.840]  handlebars were like aligned with the the tire you know I mean right sideways
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:30.120]  and I I hit my head of course and no no helmet of course no because we didn't do
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.800]  helmets back we didn't do helmets and I knocked myself out oh my god so you know
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:41.880]  it was about 530 in the afternoon and the next next thing I know the there was
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:47.840]  a cleaning lady from the school and she was Latino she didn't speak I don't
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.360]  think she spoke English as her first language and and and she was you know
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.720]  shaking me and she said she saw me hit it she saw me hit the tree and she
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:02.000]  wanted to know if I was okay and I had like a giant goose egg on the right side
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.680]  of my forehead I mean just like a big goose egg but all I could think was that
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.520]  my parents would be mad at me if they found out that I was making this jump
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:16.480]  and I said I'm okay and she's like no no let me where do you live you know let me
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:20.920]  take you home and I'm like okay I'm okay and then I looked at my bike and the
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.840]  steering wheel was sideways and I was like oh my god my parents are gonna kill
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.280]  me they're gonna know it and I like put it put the tire between my knees and in
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.520]  like I'd screwed up my bike enough that like it was easy easy to straighten the
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.680]  handlebars you know what I mean yep and I was like I'm okay and I was definitely
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:46.600]  not okay I had been knocked out like five minutes I had a giant goose egg on
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:51.600]  my head and this very very kind sweet cleaning lady was just like trying to
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.840]  make sure I was okay and I'm like walking away with this bike with crooked
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:00.640]  handlebars thinking like I got to get home and figure out a story if I found
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.200]  out my kid did that I would be furious yeah well so did you get away with it
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:09.560]  yeah totally got away I have no idea and they don't listen my podcast they still
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:16.680]  so we're not gonna tell them let me let me let me take a break here and thank

[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:51.280]  them out at linode comm slash the talk show what do you think about this the
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.160]  stuff with Facebook getting fined by the FTC I think this is a five five billion
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.120]  dollars yeah I I get it because it's like a record-breaking fine and so it
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:06.880]  seems like that's significant and I really do feel I the best I can't
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:12.200]  emphasize enough how good Kara Swisher is New York Times column on this was a
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:17.440]  couple of weeks ago where she was just like add a zero and then we're talking
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:21.400]  because other than that they've just chalked this up as the cost of doing
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:28.240]  business like and and the fact that when this quote unquote record-breaking FTC
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:34.820]  fine was announced Facebook stock went up it tells you everything you need to
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:41.360]  know where they've managed this and again it is a record-breaking so I get
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:46.240]  it but I I feel like we're in new territory on some of this you know you
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.720]  know what I mean yeah I mean that's kind of a scale problem like we were talking
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.720]  earlier about Dropbox's value and Twitter's value and Facebook's value I
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.360]  don't know how to grapple with these numbers so like Facebook's value to
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.440]  remind folks is five hundred and seventy seven billion dollars so that in that
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.800]  context five billion seems kind of small but if you just gave me a number five
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.880]  but it seemed like a good idea to find Facebook five billion dollars well if I
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:19.240]  check my mail tomorrow and I got a five billion dollars I would be I would break
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:23.520]  into a sweat I would I would be a little nervous because I think yeah I got to
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.960]  put this on a finance plan you have to pay this off over time or anybody who's
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.240]  listening you can kind of do the rough math like what would you have to do to
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.960]  be charged to find that is one one hundredth of your net worth right like
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.360]  right so all of a sudden right and all of a sudden you peg it at one one
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  hundredth of my net worth and you know and right so so is what Facebook did
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.200]  bad enough that it should be more than one hundred one one hundredth of their
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.680]  net worth or you know I guess I just have to admit I don't really know how
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:09.040]  these things should be tabulated seems like there should be a punitive aspect
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.200]  and there should be like an aspect of it that sort of sets an example for other
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:19.720]  companies and I guess what you're saying it seems compelling to me that Facebook
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.360]  is able to just sort of shrug this off so it doesn't seem either that punitive
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:32.200]  or that sort of demonstrative of the seriousness that other companies will
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:40.040]  face if they try the same things right right the other thing and again it gets
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.880]  back to this non-consensual technology I've been meaning to write about it I
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.160]  have a blog post that is mostly written but I was on vacation so it's not
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.920]  completely written but my friend Mike Davidson at the beginning of July wrote
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:02.000]  a post about superhuman which is a invitation only for the at least for the
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.880]  moment $30 a month front end to Gmail so in other words if you if you know
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:12.240]  somebody and they can get you in or you're on their list and they say you're
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:19.080]  in okay now you sign up you pay $30 a month and you get their interface to
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:25.920]  Gmail so it's an email client you do it through a web browser people seem to
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.020]  love it I cannot for the life of me imagine doing my email through a web
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:38.640]  browser Gmail or otherwise so I mean it's not for me but the thing that Mike
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:46.880]  my friend Mike Davidson pointed out was that they have a red receipt feature
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:58.000]  that's on by default and it uses like a single one by one pixel gifs yeah and so
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.740]  your every email you send has a little invisible gif and when anybody whoever
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:09.760]  you send your email to maybe I just send an email to my friend Daniel and it just
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.000]  says hey Daniel you want to be on my do you want to be on my podcast this Monday
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.800]  and then if you use their client it'll tell you Daniel read the email at you
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:27.120]  know 11 o'clock a.m. Monday morning and then he read it again at 1 and it used
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:33.880]  to it until till Michael Mike pointed this out it would even do geolocation
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.200]  based on your IP and would say like you know from Boston Massachusetts he read
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:46.560]  it at 10 a.m. but then at 2 in the afternoon he read it from you know the
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:54.960]  coast of Maine or wherever you are mm-hmm which is a creepy AF and after he
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:03.160]  posted this like I get how it works I get how most if not every modern email
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:09.420]  client the message viewer pain is effectively a web browser and it you
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:16.520]  know whether it's mail dot app on Mac or iOS certainly if you're reading your
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:22.840]  email in a web browser like you know if you just go to gmail.com and whatever
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:28.640]  your favorite browser is clearly the message renderer is part of a web
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.600]  browser and it loads the message and it loads this invisible pixel and then they
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:40.480]  use reverse geo tracking on the IP but I asked you know I asked my wife I asked a
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:44.200]  couple other people who are totally non-technical do you do you realize that
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.120]  this would be possible that every time you look at a specific message the
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:54.180]  person who sent it would be able to tell hey this you know Amy read this message
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:59.800]  at 11 a.m. she read it at 1 and then she read it the next day again at 2 p.m. and
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.460]  here's where she was and they were like every single person I asked was like no
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:07.480]  that's not possible is it and I was like yeah actually that that is possible and
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:14.980]  he wrote this up and then the CEO of superhuman had a fairly you know it
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:21.280]  wasn't super defensive you know it was a fairly decent response except for the
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:26.800]  fact that it didn't acknowledge that the fundamental idea to me is wrong hmm
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:34.000]  yeah this is interesting because I have to admit as a business owner I have used
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.440]  some of these services like I've used in particular campaign monitor you know one
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.640]  of these email services where you know one of the responses I see Mike
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.560]  Davidson's post he said he addresses like well it's one of the one of the
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.280]  excuses is everybody does this yeah tracking pixels and emails are a thing
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.560]  and mail chimp is a longtime sponsor during fireball in this podcast mail
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.000]  chimp I think has the same feature mm-hmm it's it's one of these things
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.240]  where it forces me to really think carefully about my own ethical stance on
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.520]  this because frankly so this is one of these situations where I'm like I'm
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.600]  getting back to what we said earlier about maybe you and I being examples of
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.700]  people who are a little bit more tuned in to how to protect ourselves slash
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:22.440]  maybe a little more paranoid sometimes I have that feature on in mail on my Mac
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:29.040]  that doesn't load remote content by default right so I think anybody who
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.680]  emailed me from superhuman would not be tracking me unless I explicitly click
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.400]  that load remote content button and then you know back to the confessional part I
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.880]  have sent out how many people even know that option exists right not very many
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.880]  and I have sent emails I'm not very good at sending emails from a company point
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.160]  of view but the times I have sent them like a couple times over the last 15
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:58.080]  years I haven't gone out of my way to disable that feature or anything I
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.060]  haven't said like hey campaign monitor cool it on the tracking and then to be
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.720]  honest when I see stuff like well for you know whatever 10% of the people
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.360]  have opened this email since you sent it five minutes ago let's say I find that
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:17.160]  interesting so this is a what's one of these things again it's like the theme
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:24.880]  again legitimate bona fide user experience improvement but at what cost
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:30.200]  right right and and I get it and I've talked to a you know we you know you and
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.080]  I have a bunch of friends who run independent software companies and and
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:39.400]  you know it's a good idea to have a mailing list and I know you know if Ben
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:46.440]  Thompson you know who runs a paid subscription mailing list you know for
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.240]  his main business Stratechery you know you you give him X dollars per year and
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:58.040]  then four days a week you get a custom email just for subscribers to you and I
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:02.040]  don't know if he uses campaign monitor or MailChimp I forget what he uses but
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:06.200]  it doesn't even matter but I know that he's he's got a tracking pixel or
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:11.800]  tracking image in there and he can see you know what percentage you know a 78
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:16.000]  percent of subscribers open this in the last 24 hours well that's interesting to
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  know because it's in the aggregate and it's not wrong but when I send a message
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:29.360]  to my hypothetical yeah ex-girlfriend or girlfriend and we're estranged and then
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:35.400]  I can see when and where how many times she opened it that's yeah it's it's
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.560]  wrong on a personal I I don't know that it's wrong in the aggregate for a
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:44.760]  mailing list but I know that it's wrong on a personal level and even if they've
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.120]  disabled the reverse geo tracking which they apparently have in response to Mike
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.760]  Davidson's thing it's still wrong to let us to let somebody know that they've
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:46:00.560]  read it like the real red receipts when you use the official email protocol red
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.280]  receipt is opt-in right it's like same thing with iMessage like real like and
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:14.400]  that's the thing that I my in draft post on this is emphasizing is how how
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:21.240]  corrupt we've let email get over the last two decades because it clearly was
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.920]  never meant for this right like email was never ever ever meant for something
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.380]  where when you read a message the person who sent it to you could tell when you
[01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:38.440]  did it without your compliance in any way that is absolutely not within the
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.200]  spec it's not within the design but it is technically possible now that we've
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:49.520]  allowed the message body of emails to be web browsers effectively it's it's a
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:54.400]  total inadvertent thing and that to me is sort of the bottom line of this story
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.600]  is like I kind of get I got I'm glad that superhuman you know acknowledged
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.360]  Mike's post and they've taken some actions and they disabled the geo
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:10.560]  tracking but my bigger takeaway is that the every single major email client has
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.760]  sort of dropped the ball on even allowing this it shouldn't even be
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.320]  possible and I'm not quite sure I've been thinking about it for weeks now
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.400]  because it's a couple of weeks old I'm convinced though that there's a way that
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.240]  every email client could could make this not possible you know like and I'm not
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:33.360]  quite sure what it would be like because the traditional way of sending an email
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.920]  like in the old days was that email was just text it was just it was just like
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.080]  you know like iMessage you just send a string of characters and that's the
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:48.360]  message and that's it so there is no metadata but even with inline
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.420]  attachments and yet you could say you know if I sent you a picture you know an
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:59.520]  email with two photos from my vacation and those photos are in the email
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.520]  they're on your you get the whole email it's on your device whether it's your
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:11.220]  Mac or your phone or whatever the whole email is there including the
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:17.440]  attachments so that when you view it nothing on my side gets ping even if I
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.320]  send you an email and I you know the the barn doors are already open we've lost
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.440]  the war on on rich text email with the server side images and stuff like that
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:33.560]  we're not gonna be able to undo that you can't make an email client today that
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.800]  doesn't load that that refuses to load remote images but I feel like there
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:45.400]  should be there's got to be a way that clients can load those remote images in
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:51.520]  an anonymous way yeah well real quick John before you get a bunch of emails I
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:57.440]  think I want to just point out that in case it's not obvious the the deal with
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:01.040]  those email companies like MailChimp and Campaign Monitor it's not strictly
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:07.840]  aggregate they do let you go in and say yeah yeah so um but I think that's what
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:12.160]  most people do though I I do yeah like don't wouldn't you say that like as you
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:17.280]  as the red sweater software guy wouldn't you say your interest is mostly in the
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.400]  aggregate my end yes but that's just like that's that just happens to be my
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:25.680]  right personal attitude I don't I don't give everybody that much credit all right
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:31.360]  and in fact I think that the mailing services it's it's part of their
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:36.040]  business proposition that you can identify on a on a subscriber by
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.060]  subscriber basis you go into the consoles of these services and they show
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:44.200]  you on a map like where the person was when they open the email I mean let's
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.720]  just not it's just it's we can't really dance around it it's creepy and so that's
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:56.120]  a that's I think one of the interesting things about this this mail app doing it
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:00.160]  is that it makes all of these individuals who use the app agents of
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.360]  this kind of creepiness whereas what we're used to is that companies are
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.480]  creepy sometimes right right and then suddenly now this app has made
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.720]  individuals creepy and I think that's a good example if you say you know should
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.800]  you be able to like email your ex-girlfriend and then see when they
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.600]  open the email so anyway I just want to get that out of the way make sure people
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:27.480]  know we know that this is not strictly aggregate and I think that's a good
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:33.040]  point I think you're right though that male clients could be doing something
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.760]  about this let's give Apple a tiny bit of credit the fact that there is this
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:44.240]  feature that you can turn off loading the remote content is good but getting
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:48.040]  back to like all these things that have been changing over the years with Safari
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.360]  for example we talked about not being able to click on a bookmarklet anymore
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:56.160]  without a prompt coming up right where is all the attention like what if they
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:00.840]  put as much attention into email security as they did into Safari
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:06.800]  security and it that is exactly what I think they should do I really do and I
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:13.600]  think the Safari team literally leads the industry in protecting browser users
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:20.960]  personal privacy but I really think that the mail dot app team needs either the
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:27.720]  same dose of privacy first you know vitamins or they you know should borrow
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:33.280]  people from the Safari team because literally the way that email privacy is
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:41.680]  being violated is through web views right oh yeah and I really hope that
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:46.840]  it's sort of an eye-opener that's the gist of the post that I you know mostly
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:52.880]  done writing but I really I think it's overdue and and and I I don't blame them
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:59.560]  for overlooking it because I feel like they're mostly comprised of people like
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:04.720]  me who just that you just don't think of that you don't think of how are people
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:10.040]  violating your privacy through email right you just write you know you're
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:17.960]  thinking how do I reliably and efficiently download and sync these
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:23.880]  IMAP mailboxes between devices you know you're not really thinking about that
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:28.160]  because you're not a shitbird who's trying to violate people's privacy but
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:34.840]  the truth is people are using email to violate privacy and so it to me that's
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:38.760]  the bottom line is it doesn't even matter what superhuman does or says
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:42.680]  they're going to do the bottom line is that the major email client makers
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.360]  should make it impossible for that to happen and they should just cut it off
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:53.560]  just make it so that nobody can tell when or if you've ever opened an email
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:59.040]  it's it's absolutely and I'm telling you when I talk to people in my family my
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:03.280]  wife and a couple of other people and ask them if they thought it was possible
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:07.400]  that somebody when they sent you an email could tell when you when or if you
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.900]  read it you know yeah they're they're like no of course not and I'm like yeah
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:15.360]  actually depending on how they said it yeah they could totally do it with an
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:19.160]  invisible tracking pixel and they're appalled they are absolutely shocked and
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:26.320]  the other really big tell to me is that every major messaging platform in the
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:31.880]  last 20 years after email nobody has ever made that possible like that's not
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:36.960]  possible in iMessage it's not possible in whatsapp it's not possible and these
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:43.420]  other things you know like iMessage has read receipts but it is a total opt
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:48.200]  it's off by default and you have to turn it on and therefore you're allowing
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.520]  people to say okay they can tell that you've read it but it doesn't say when
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:59.080]  it doesn't say where it just says read and that's and it's opt-in yeah the fact
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:04.800]  that with the email that they've built this system where you have no opt-in and
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:10.080]  it reveals all this information about you it's absolutely appalling and any
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:17.000]  kind of defense of it is to me dishonest because everybody knows that is not how
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.920]  email was designed that the clear design of the system from the early 90s or late
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.000]  80s whenever you know email as we know it was invented clearly did not involve
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.680]  involuntary read receipts no let's say it's an interesting example you can
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:39.000]  almost imagine Apple trying to wait out this being an issue like if you imagined
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.640]  at one point ten years ago that iMessage is gonna you know prevail or something
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.000]  and people aren't going to be using email anymore then you might just say
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.040]  well that's just a legacy technology but it's clearly not it doesn't show any
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  sign of just disappearing and it does seem like it would be such a great like
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:06.760]  WWDC keynote message to be like you know also we made mail finally respect your
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.640]  privacy like yeah and and an example that came to mind it's kind of along the
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:14.720]  lines of this whole system they have in place where you can do things like send
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.800]  you know you can send like large files to people and Apple basically hosts it
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:25.800]  temporarily yeah so imagine if Apple had a system where they could like securely
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:32.320]  send like a hash of a URL to Apple servers or something and then I don't
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:35.640]  know something something something and they can decide does this look like a
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:40.520]  unique URL or not right like imagine if there's a feature in mail where you say
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:44.440]  okay right now I have this load remote content thing I have to click for every
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:49.840]  mail message but if I could just say mail it's okay for you to load any
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.560]  resource that doesn't look like it has a tracking ID in it for me and then
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.160]  furthermore it could like it could like it could load that resource from Apple's
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.480]  servers you know cuz I kind of sort of like trampoline it through Apple and so
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:11.120]  then I could get that that satisfied the promise of email as a conveyance of text
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:16.560]  and images and layout information but the distributor of that information
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:22.160]  doesn't have any idea who asked for it I I've been thinking about this a lot all
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:27.160]  month long ever since Mike started writing about it about because my first
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:30.920]  thought Mike wrote to me and he's a longtime friend and he sent me an early
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.160]  draft of his first post and he was like I'm not even sure I'm gonna publish this
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.840]  and I read it I sent him a couple of typos you know like just copy editing
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.680]  things but I was like overall I was like you've got to publish this because this
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.840]  is dynamite this is gonna blow up and I I don't want to you know I want to say
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:56.400]  I was right but I was right it blew up and it was huge but the second thought
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.600]  the first thought I had was you know what when you put it in these terms like
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.320]  I always I knew this was possible but when you put it in these terms and you
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:10.760]  show me like screenshots of what superhuman shows people about like where
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.600]  and when people see these emails I was like this is explosive people are gonna
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:20.120]  people are gonna be irate but the second thought I had was email clients should
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:25.600]  defend against this it's it this that we could beat this I know that there's a
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:29.240]  way to do it but the thing I've been thinking about all month is I'm not a
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:34.320]  hundred percent sure whether it should be at the email client end or at the
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:39.280]  email provider end in other words if Apple was going to defend against this
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:45.560]  should it be in mail dot app or should it be on iCloud you know so that your
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.680]  your mac.com account does what you're saying like read the email load all of
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:59.680]  the remote resources and store them on iCloud calm or mac.com whatever to you
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:04.400]  know whatever your domain is for your email and then let you download them
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.320]  once from there but then you're not hitting them directly so they never
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:14.240]  really know the whether you read it or not and then if you read the email again
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:20.520]  it's all locally cached I'm not you know on the one hand I think it would be
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:25.400]  easier to do it I definitely think it would be easier to do it from the server
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:33.840]  side and have the the your your imap provider do it on their side but on the
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:40.360]  other hand if they don't do it at the client side you're not defended if
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.560]  you're not using their their email service right and so in other words if
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:52.880]  daring fireball net isn't hosted by somebody who supports defending against
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:58.840]  this should the client still help me out and you know and that's the way that
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:03.520]  that to me is the way that Safari team has as tackled stuff to their credit is
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:08.360]  that the Safari team is like we don't care what websites do what they comply
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:13.200]  with if they comply with GDPR or best practices or whatever we're going to if
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:17.600]  you use Safari as your web browser we are going to protect your privacy and I
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.640]  kind of feel like that's what the mail dot app team should do I think this is a
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:28.520]  great example of Apple having its sort of benevolent user focused protection
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:34.800]  stuff that's part of their DNA come up against now this whole like we keep
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:38.440]  seeing again and again like what's the next service Apple is going to provide
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:42.400]  it if you think about it through that sort of lens it's a natural if Apple
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:48.400]  said okay now we have mail plus or whatever yes yeah it's a little bit of a
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:52.560]  situation where if Apple wasn't on this run of trying to add new services all
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:57.000]  the time with a with a bone you know and it plays into it plays well into the
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.880]  idea that like your mail hosting would maybe eat into your iCloud quota and all
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.320]  that stuff it definitely seems like there are some challenges to any kind of
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:14.360]  like you know even temporary hosting of arbitrary users email images or whatever
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:18.120]  so I don't know I think you're right that you know earlier when you're saying
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:22.840]  they should they should get like the get the same kind of attitude as the WebKit
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:27.680]  team or a Safari team it almost just seems like literally the Safari team
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:34.240]  should take over the mail view component yeah for the web for the web view
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:40.140]  version yeah of mail right and again the argument over whether emails should be a
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.680]  web view or not that we've lost that I mean there's no use arguing over that
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.400]  anymore you can't ship a modern email client that only renders email as plain
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.440]  text whether I think that's the way it should have been I think it should have
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:57.840]  stayed that way but that argument is decades old lost right and so let's be
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.120]  practical and admit that you know people get email they want it to look the way
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:06.040]  the email is supposed to look which is a rich graphical view but I think there's
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:13.360]  numerous ways that it could be done anonymously and and I really think it's
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:17.000]  important I I think that that's the thing that this superhuman thing has
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.880]  exposed to me it's not nothing to do a superhuman in particular but the fact
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:27.360]  that our modern view of email as a web view really needs to be protected and
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:32.200]  tightened up and we're we're sort of doing it open kimono style right now and
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:37.560]  just think about that a little bit more actually maybe you know if we step back
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.820]  this problem applies to people who use Gmail whatever on the web the web
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:45.720]  browser stuff absolutely so if you look at it from that perspective maybe it's
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.000]  not that you know mail needs to hand over the mail view to the WebKit team
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.320]  but maybe it's that Safari the WebKit team need to solve this across the board
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.680]  right so you know maybe there's some kind of proxying service that protects
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:05.600]  you regardless of where you you load your web content that that's the kind of
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.840]  thing I could I couldn't see Apple doing and I don't know how practical it is but
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.960]  wouldn't it be great if they could solve this not just a mail dot app but an all
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:20.800]  all and all mail apps and on the web just by some kind of clever web-based
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:24.800]  thing well and it's yeah it's a sort of thing that I could definitely see Apple
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:29.640]  doing I can definitely see that I know that there are people that had Apple who
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:33.720]  would love to tackle the problem that's the thing is isn't that the best type of
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:38.640]  programming problem is one that you want to tackle you know you're like oh that
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.360]  that mountain of shit I would love to get rid of that right you know what I
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:48.680]  mean I would love when you know that there are people at Apple who would love
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:54.240]  to fix this and so I really hope that it's opened their eyes to it like hey
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:57.240]  you know what we've kind of had our eyes closed to this just because we never
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:03.120]  really thought about it but this is the sort of thing we could fix and I can't
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:07.940]  even list I mean that the it's an arm's length the number of things that the
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:13.340]  WebKit slash Safari team has fixed over the last five years since they've really
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:19.160]  really gone you know nose to the grindstone on these privacy issues and
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:25.040]  they're just amazing problems and and they fixed them one after another after
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.880]  another and they just keep coming and and I really think though that it this
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:36.800]  is the first one that really breaks out of the web browser itself you know yeah
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.520]  well yeah it's a good example of a problem a set of problems that are
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:45.000]  technical challenges and they are so they have the gratification of solving a
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.240]  technical challenge but also the gratification of providing like a public
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:53.320]  good and that's I do it yeah doing the right thing yeah right
[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.320]  Daniel I really appreciate your time I hope you enjoy the rest of the summer
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:03.000]  everybody can hear the dulcet tones of your wonderful voice on your regular
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:10.220]  podcast with our mutual friend Manton Reese on core intuition which you could
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:14.000]  probably write that's yeah that's it core intuition oh my god I got it right
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.500]  you got it right could just search for that in whatever your favorite podcast
[02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:24.320]  app is it'll be the number one hit Manton is a fine individual yes he is
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  how often do you guys do you guys publish episodes of core intuition we're
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:33.520]  pretty regular pretty much every week not every not so we're not so regular on
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:37.480]  the exact day of the week but pretty much 52 we probably do 50 episodes a
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:49.880]  year yeah so do I yeah my giver giver take 20 also you've I mean I don't even
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:55.040]  know where to get I don't know you got bit splitting yeah which is a great blog
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:05:00.560]  that you post with technical stuff you've got what's what's your Twitter
[02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:08.480]  your Twitter is Daniel punk ass three things that go great yeah well no it's a
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:14.120]  very aptly named yeah her account but that'll get people started if they want
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:16.840]  more they want to they want to learn more that's a great place to find out
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:23.040]  basically as as John mentioned red sweater software is my is my main jam
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:29.120]  Mars edit is the app I have been mostly working on over the past ten years and
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.680]  then that's that's the blog editor you've also got black ink yep which is
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:38.800]  your crossword app which is a lot of fun I I've gotten more into crosswords as
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:44.000]  I've gotten older I have to say that's good keeps your brain young it does a
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.240]  little bit and and you know what I feel like the older you are the better you
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:52.480]  are at getting some obscure references you know yeah like when I was young I
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:56.560]  always found crosswords very frustrating because they they'd they'd give me
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.120]  references then I was like how am I supposed to know that that's from the
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:02.280]  70s you know yeah well I'll tell you what I think we have a little cheat
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:06.400]  which is that it particularly if you do in the New York Times crossword it helps
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:13.640]  that the New York Times crossword editor is also old one of these days they're
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:18.320]  gonna replace will shorts and it's gonna be somebody young and we're all gonna be
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:26.800]  screwed we're gonna be like absolutely yeah I think that's absolutely I think
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:33.120]  that's the key to my increased enjoyment of crosswords in recent years is that
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:39.880]  now I'm like I'm like prime demographic for all of the obscure clues but anyway
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:44.400]  Thank You Daniel I I really appreciate it and have a good rest of your summer
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:48.800]  thanks you to try keep cool down there it's kind of cool enough now finally
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:53.200]  here it's only 80 degrees but yeah hopefully continue that trend thanks so
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:07:15.160]  much John for having me on the show I hope you build a nice sandwich for me
