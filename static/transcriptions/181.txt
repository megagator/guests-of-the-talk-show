[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  We had a very fun interaction earlier today.
[00:03.840 --> 00:08.240]  I find one of the ways, I mean, clearly overall I am rocketing
[00:08.240 --> 00:11.520]  at light speed towards crotchety old man status.
[00:11.520 --> 00:14.640]  I mean, there's no doubt about it. I mean, you know, I can't remember. I watch
[00:14.640 --> 00:17.280]  Saturday Night Live every week. I don't remember the last time I'd ever heard of
[00:17.280 --> 00:21.360]  the musical guest.
[00:21.600 --> 00:25.680]  I mean, who was the music? I've already forgotten,
[00:25.680 --> 00:31.920]  which is another sign of short-term memory.
[00:31.920 --> 00:35.840]  But there are a handful of ways where I feel like, hey,
[00:35.840 --> 00:38.960]  see, I've still got it. I'm with the kids, and one of them is
[00:38.960 --> 00:42.800]  is I keep using emoji more and more.
[00:43.760 --> 00:47.600]  I've noticed. Here's the thing. When did iOS add the feature
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.480]  where the auto suggestions above the keyboard include emoji? I think
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.200]  that's iOS 10, like it just came out like five months ago, right? But I've been
[00:57.200 --> 01:01.120]  using it since the summer on betas, so I've been using it for seven or eight
[01:01.120 --> 01:05.680]  months at least. I have to say I never really noticed
[01:05.680 --> 01:07.760]  that, and I think part of it is I never use
[01:07.760 --> 01:11.440]  those auto suggestions. I should just close that and take the space back.
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.720]  It's like I'm looking at the keyboard while I type,
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.920]  and me looking at the keyboard while I type means I don't see anything above
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.240]  the keyboard, so I never use those. And I'll bet
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.720]  people who do type faster. And it does seem, when I do
[01:24.720 --> 01:27.200]  pay attention to it, it seems like the suggestions are
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.520]  sometimes amazing, where you can type a fairly long word,
[01:31.520 --> 01:37.440]  and it guesses. You type like a few words, and it guesses what the next
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.840]  word's going to be. Right, right. You type a u, and somehow it guesses that you wanted to type
[01:41.840 --> 01:45.600]  the word authorized because of the context of where it is.
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.800]  It's like, wow, you could really save a lot of thumb taps by
[01:48.800 --> 01:54.080]  just a u and then autoconstitute. Anyway, I noticed I've... Well, you're too old for that now.
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.480]  Yeah, but I'm starting to notice those emoji that pop up
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.880]  as a suggestion, and so I sent one to you.
[02:00.880 --> 02:03.680]  And I said the word think, and when you type the word think, there's like a
[02:03.680 --> 02:08.640]  little like thought cloud with a thing, and you said
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.000]  you said it looks more like a fart than a thought.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.200]  And I thought, well, I've got to use that immediately, and
[02:15.200 --> 02:21.040]  within like 10 seconds of paging through what can I connect the fart emoji to,
[02:21.040 --> 02:28.960]  I found the poodle, the dog emoji, and it's even pointing the right way
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.360]  where the little dot of the puffy cloud is coming
[02:33.360 --> 02:37.680]  from the dog. You should get that into the show notes.
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.720]  I happen to know that you have a big white poodle.
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.800]  I do, yeah. I know that's the great thing about that.
[02:46.800 --> 02:50.320]  Thank God. This was an argument early on when we got the dog with my
[02:50.320 --> 02:53.120]  wife. It was like, you know, if we're getting a poodle, I want it to be cut like a
[02:53.120 --> 02:56.480]  regular dog. I don't want to have it cut like... First of all, I want it to be a big
[02:56.480 --> 02:59.600]  poodle. I didn't want some tiny little teacup
[02:59.600 --> 03:04.240]  thing that's shaking all the time. So that was number one.
[03:04.240 --> 03:09.040]  Number two was like, I can't have him cut like fancy show poodle.
[03:09.040 --> 03:12.720]  So he's mostly cut like a regular dog. He's got kind of like a poofy
[03:12.720 --> 03:16.480]  head, and usually his tail is a little bushy, but
[03:16.480 --> 03:22.160]  for the rest, this is usually fairly straightforward dog cut.
[03:22.160 --> 03:25.280]  So he doesn't look exactly like that, but he is
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.240]  white, and yeah, so it's kind of perfect.
[03:30.240 --> 03:33.600]  The emoji is actually named poodle.
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.600]  I don't know why poodles, among all dogs,
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.160]  deserve their own emoji. Like, what gets an emoji and what doesn't is
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.880]  sometimes so bizarrely like, why is poodle
[03:46.880 --> 03:52.240]  its own thing? How many other... There must be other dogs there. I'm looking. I typed
[03:52.240 --> 03:55.120]  dog, and there's one that's just dog.
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.440]  It's just a generic dog, and then there's poodle, and I think that's it.
[03:59.440 --> 04:05.040]  Oh, and then there's also dog face. There's also dog face.
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.560]  Oh yeah, there's faces.
[04:09.520 --> 04:12.720]  Poodles are great dogs. I do not have a dog.
[04:12.720 --> 04:16.640]  This is a conversation that occasionally comes up in the
[04:16.640 --> 04:19.920]  Gruber household of whether or not we should get a dog.
[04:19.920 --> 04:23.200]  My belief is that we travel too much, and that
[04:23.200 --> 04:30.480]  we don't have any kind of friends or family who live near us
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.840]  by design. And so, you know, it would be like a kennel
[04:35.840 --> 04:38.160]  situation several times a year, and I just feel like
[04:38.160 --> 04:42.240]  I don't feel like that's good for the dog. And I mean, I know that
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.680]  that kennels are a little different than they used to be. I think that
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.040]  they're a little bit more like camp.
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.080]  Yeah, spas. Yeah, so that's good. You know, like when we were kids, I
[04:54.080 --> 04:56.960]  mean, like when people had to put their dogs in a kennel, they just put them like
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.080]  in a cage, like a little two-by-four cage,
[05:02.080 --> 05:06.640]  and that's terrible.
[05:06.640 --> 05:10.000]  Yeah, and for a while he was going to, like
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.240]  when we get desperate, he's gone to this place that has like,
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.080]  they sleep in cages, but then during the day, it's a doggy daycare
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.080]  thing. So he's out running around with a whole bunch of other dogs in like a big
[05:22.080 --> 05:24.880]  room, which is, I think, kind of fun for him.
[05:24.880 --> 05:28.160]  Although he doesn't, I don't think he likes staying outside the house.
[05:28.160 --> 05:31.600]  I think he gets anxiety about that. So he,
[05:31.600 --> 05:38.320]  now we have this daughter of someone that Karen used to
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.880]  work with, and her boyfriend come and stay, and
[05:42.880 --> 05:46.320]  I don't think the daughter likes Grant very much,
[05:46.320 --> 05:51.600]  but the boyfriend loves Grant. So they take, they have, they apparently
[05:51.600 --> 05:55.760]  have a great time together, and they're coming back to the next
[05:55.760 --> 05:58.400]  time we go away. So they've only done that once before, but we were gone for
[05:58.400 --> 06:02.960]  like two weeks. So, you know, I think, so there's, I think
[06:02.960 --> 06:07.280]  this is a Shiba Inu, if I'm not mistaken. So there's
[06:07.280 --> 06:10.880]  Poodle, and then there's Shiba Inu. Yeah, but when you hover over it, it
[06:10.880 --> 06:15.280]  just says dog. So they might have, that might be, okay, well, yeah, but I
[06:15.280 --> 06:18.480]  mean, it's the Japanese dog. So it makes sense that that would,
[06:18.480 --> 06:21.200]  that would be the look. What's your dog's name? We shouldn't just
[06:21.200 --> 06:25.360]  Grant, Grant, Grant, like, uh, like Ulysses S.
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.920]  Like Ulysses S, yeah. I love a Poodle. It was one of our, if we were to get a
[06:29.920 --> 06:32.880]  dog, a Poodle would be on the short list. You know, you never hear about a Poodle
[06:32.880 --> 06:38.080]  when somebody has a Poodle. You never hear, well, that's a miserable, angry dog.
[06:38.960 --> 06:42.080]  That's true. That's true. He's, he's pretty good-natured.
[06:42.080 --> 06:45.600]  I mean, he barks like crazy at, you know, anything that goes down the street, but
[06:45.600 --> 06:47.680]  he's, he's good with us. Like, I mean, and, you
[06:47.680 --> 06:50.720]  know, and the kid, the kid's not bad now, but when he was a
[06:50.720 --> 06:54.960]  little younger, you know, he could be rough and, and, uh, he's never, he's never
[06:54.960 --> 06:58.320]  bitten him. Amy had a Poodle growing up named Andy and he was a
[06:58.320 --> 07:00.880]  good, he was a really good dog and he lived a very,
[07:00.880 --> 07:04.000]  so among the things that I like about Poodles, they have good dispositions.
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.240]  They do not shed, uh, uh, and they're, they're hypoallergenic. That's, that's the
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.800]  real reason we needed to get a Poodle because Karen's,
[07:12.800 --> 07:15.600]  yeah, and even, but even if you're not allergic, it's like
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.040]  the, the, the stuff that people are allergic to, it's, you know, it kind of
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.000]  has a smell in my opinion. Uh, and you know, the hair
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.120]  thing is, it would drive me nuts. Uh, so good
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.680]  disposition, uh, and they live a long time. They're,
[07:29.680 --> 07:33.440]  they're a long living, uh, breed.
[07:33.760 --> 07:36.640]  I have a friend, a friend from college who has,
[07:36.640 --> 07:41.600]  uh, well, I actually guess at this point it's been so long, has had a series
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.280]  of Great Danes with his wife and family. Oh yeah. And
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.440]  the Great Danes, they're beautiful dogs. I mean, they're magnificent. I mean, but
[07:49.440 --> 07:52.560]  you know, they're also to me terrifying because if they stood up, they'd be like
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.240]  eight feet tall. But, but they're apparently so good
[07:56.240 --> 07:59.280]  nature. They're so sweet. Absolutely. That's what he says when we've talked about it,
[07:59.280 --> 08:05.600]  that they are, you know, they, you know, they're, they really are like Marmaduke.
[08:05.600 --> 08:09.520]  Um, but they only live like six years. It's, it's like heartbreaking.
[08:09.520 --> 08:12.640]  It's like you're signing up for like a series,
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.480]  a constant series of family heartbreak. Yeah.
[08:16.480 --> 08:20.080]  Right. Where the dog is magnificent and has a great disposition and is truly part
[08:20.080 --> 08:24.800]  of the family and then he's gone.
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.720]  Karen was at the, uh, at the vet with Grant one time and,
[08:28.720 --> 08:32.240]  and there was a woman there with a Great Dane and the, the dog was just, you know,
[08:32.240 --> 08:35.600]  was completely a wreck because he was, he knew he was at the vet and like, you
[08:35.600 --> 08:39.200]  know, it was totally nervous. And so he was,
[08:39.200 --> 08:45.440]  he was sitting on her lap, but because, because his front legs were so long, he
[08:45.440 --> 08:52.080]  had his front legs on, on the floor and his butt on her woman's lap.
[08:52.080 --> 08:57.280]  And he could just like, you know, then he was shivering because he was terrified.
[08:57.280 --> 09:00.480]  I, Amy had a poodle and he lived, I think Andy was,
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.240]  I swear to God, I think he might've been like 18 when he died, which is,
[09:04.240 --> 09:07.440]  yeah, I mean, at least 17, it was really a long time.
[09:07.440 --> 09:10.880]  And he was like stone cold deaf for the last few years.
[09:10.880 --> 09:14.240]  Uh, and, but, but it was like as though he
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.440]  could still imagine sounds. And so like he'd be sleeping and there was this, it
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.720]  was, it was so, he was just great. He was a great dog
[09:22.720 --> 09:26.000]  all life and he was great in old age, but you know,
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.920]  there was a vent near the, the family, like iMac
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.760]  to the side, a vent in the floor. And that was like his spot because he'd just get
[09:33.760 --> 09:38.000]  to soak up the heat. And every once in a while he'd just snap
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.960]  out of his sleep because he like dreamed us out and go
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.040]  roaring towards the door like a young dog barking up a storm.
[09:45.040 --> 09:48.160]  You know, like maybe he imagined the mailman was there, you know,
[09:48.160 --> 09:51.360]  but there was no longer any correlation between the mailman actually coming in
[09:51.360 --> 09:53.920]  when he would.
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.080]  No, I had no idea. Oh man, I had a, I had a dog growing up who was,
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.200]  uh, we, we got from, uh, uh, uh, we just saw like an ad in the
[10:03.200 --> 10:06.240]  paper and just took like, not really a rescue dog, but just some,
[10:06.240 --> 10:09.840]  you know, I don't know, woman, literally like a trailer park,
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.600]  uh, Chester. I loved the son of a bitch, but he was, he was really nasty. He was, he
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.760]  was, he was, uh, supposedly about three quarters poodle
[10:19.760 --> 10:22.800]  and one quarter pecanese. And I think the nasty part came from
[10:22.800 --> 10:26.720]  the pecanese. He had, it does. Yeah, Karen, Karen had pecanese growing up
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.000]  and she, she would get, she said she got bit all the
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.440]  time. They would just bite you. Well, Chester, Chester would, uh,
[10:33.440 --> 10:37.280]  he was sort of built more like a poodle, uh, did not shed, but he didn't, his hair
[10:37.280 --> 10:40.560]  was curly-ish, but not, you know, like poodle-tight curls, black
[10:40.560 --> 10:44.800]  and white. And he had a terrible underbite, uh,
[10:44.800 --> 10:48.800]  it was, it was not from, uh, not from good breeding,
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.600]  but I loved the son of a bitch. And when he was in a good mood, he was the
[10:51.600 --> 10:55.280]  greatest dog and he was kind of smart. And then winter, we used to put
[10:55.280 --> 10:58.720]  t-shirts on him. We would just buy like, like a, like a,
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.400]  uh, you know, size four toddler cut out a little bit for,
[11:02.400 --> 11:06.960]  yeah, peeing at the belly, uh, and then put it on backwards so that the logo
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.640]  would be on his back. And he used to love wearing shirts and
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.400]  you could just say, Chetty, go get your shirt. And he would, he, it
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.480]  was as though you said, Chetty, I'm going to give you a hamburger, you know, like,
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.920]  he, he would, he would like light up and he'd go tearing
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.240]  to where we kept his shirt, get it, and then bring it to you.
[11:26.240 --> 11:30.800]  It was, he, he could be so smart, but then the other thing he would like to do
[11:30.800 --> 11:38.160]  is he would like to, uh, crawl under any of our sofas and just stay there
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.520]  for hours at a time. And if your feet got near him, he'd snap at him.
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.400]  I swear to God, swear to God, he'd stay under for three or four hours.
[11:50.400 --> 11:53.280]  And, and, and sometimes when he was down there, he would just go, he would just be
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.480]  like, like a low growl nonstop. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[11:58.480 --> 12:04.240]  little dogs like that, they have a tendency to love being in, cause we had, uh, we had,
[12:04.240 --> 12:08.080]  uh, we had a Westie and a Scotty when I was growing up and the Scotty,
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.640]  actually the Scotty was half Westie too. And, um, the Scotty, which our two dogs,
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.760]  those two dogs did not get along, but the people who lived next door had a Westie and our Scotty
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.000]  got along really well with their Westie. And so that dog would come in and out of our house
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.880]  all the time. And, um, I remember one time we had to go someplace, uh, and, and they're like,
[12:26.880 --> 12:29.760]  you gotta get, you gotta get, I can't remember that other dog's name. You gotta get him out,
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.440]  get him out. Um, and so I go up, I go upstairs and the two of them are just like, they're under
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.920]  my parents' bed. They're just like under there, like making a fort and, you know,
[12:37.920 --> 12:44.640]  and I try and reach under there to grab them. And they're both like, I loved, I loved Chetty,
[12:44.640 --> 12:50.320]  like reaching into a den of rock. I love that dog for his, his effectively, you know,
[12:50.320 --> 12:59.040]  bipolar nature loved it. Uh, the other thing about Chester was he was a complete idiot. Uh,
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.880]  he, whenever he met a strange dog, he would want to attack it. And, you know, he was only like,
[13:05.760 --> 13:08.800]  I don't know, less than knee high. It wasn't like a tiny little dog, but he, you know,
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.520]  he was like a regular poodle, not the big standard poodle size. Uh, and he would, he would go after
[13:13.520 --> 13:16.800]  like, you know, like if you saw like somebody walking a Doberman or whatever, he'd want to
[13:16.800 --> 13:20.640]  get a fight. And it's like, what are you, what are you thinking? You have no chance.
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.560]  Like if he was left to his own in nature, he'd be dead. He would, he would find a big dog and go get
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.800]  killed. Yeah. Yeah. They're not, they're not bright. Uh, he did have, he had the same thing
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.480]  where he knew when he was going to the vet and, and he would be tearing. And he, we used to take
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.120]  them in a car, lots of places, including places that were in the general vicinity of where the
[13:41.120 --> 13:48.240]  vet was. And somehow he always knew always. Yeah. Well, he, Graham was always like that with, um,
[13:48.240 --> 13:51.680]  when we take him to doggy daycare, we don't take him very much anymore because we both work out of
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.480]  the house now. But, um, when we'd get quite close to the block where the doggy daycare was, he'd
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.560]  start going, it just gets super excited because he'd know that he was going to just run around
[14:00.560 --> 14:07.520]  like an idiot for four hours with some other dogs. Oh, good stuff. So yeah, you should get a dog.
[14:07.520 --> 14:15.120]  Um, here, let me take a break. What a better, what better time is there to talk about a new sponsor?
[14:15.120 --> 14:23.520]  Here we go. This is great. Um, today's episode is brought to you by set app, S E T A P P. It's
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.280]  a revolutionary new service for discovering, using the best apps for your Mac, what it is
[14:29.280 --> 14:36.880]  as effectively. I mean, this isn't their words, but it's mine. It's Netflix for Mac apps. You pay
[14:36.880 --> 14:44.560]  10 bucks a month. I think it's nine 99, 10 bucks a month subscription, and you get access to all of
[14:44.560 --> 14:51.520]  the apps that are participating in their program. Developers obviously opt into this and they've
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.760]  worked out some kind of deal where they all get a share. I don't know how they're doing. It doesn't,
[14:55.760 --> 15:01.920]  you know, not our business, how they're dividing the money, but Mac, the service is brought to you
[15:01.920 --> 15:08.240]  by Mac paw. And they're a company that's been around, um, for a long time. Uh, they've do
[15:08.240 --> 15:12.640]  programs like clean my Mac and a few others there. They've been indeed developers for a long time.
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.880]  Great company. I've known them for a while and they've sponsored during fireball many times.
[15:16.880 --> 15:22.160]  Um, uh, set app, they've been working on this for a while. They, they briefed me on this all
[15:22.160 --> 15:26.240]  the way back at WWDC and it is, it's truly, I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying this just because
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.040]  they're sponsoring. It is a very ambitious idea. The idea is they're going to collect
[15:31.040 --> 15:36.480]  10 bucks a month from tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, you know, who knows at some point,
[15:36.480 --> 15:40.800]  a million users, whatever this is going to grow. And that these people will have this
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.960]  access to all of these apps right now. They just launched last month, just a few weeks ago. Um,
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.560]  some of just, uh, I can't name all the apps, but these are really good apps. There's apps in there
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.280]  like Ulysses, which is a writing tool, sort of like a, uh, uh, like X code for writing,
[15:55.280 --> 16:01.440]  like a thing where you can build up big writing projects, rapid Weaver seven, clean my Mac from
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.480]  Mac Paul themselves, ultimate player, and many, many more. Just go to set up.com and you can,
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.120]  and you could see the whole list of software. There's no ads. They don't show you ads. There's
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.960]  no paid upgrades. When one of the apps in the program comes up with an update, you'll just get
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.440]  the software update. Uh, it's a, just a huge collection and the more successful it gets,
[16:21.440 --> 16:27.520]  the more apps might join in the future. I right now already, I have no hesitation saying that
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.880]  with the library of apps that they have right now, as you listen to me say this easily worth $10 a
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.760]  month easily. It's a value at $10 a month. If it grows even more, it's going to get even better.
[16:37.760 --> 16:43.760]  And here's the other thing. You can try it for 30 days for free. So you don't even have to pay them
[16:43.760 --> 16:49.600]  the first $10 upfront to get it. You can just go there, sign up, see how it works, see how easy
[16:49.600 --> 16:53.520]  it is, see how many apps are. And then at the end of the month, when it, even if there's just like
[16:53.520 --> 16:58.880]  one or two of the apps that you like, you're already getting a pretty good deal. Uh, you just
[16:58.880 --> 17:05.920]  pay $10 a month. So go to set app.com. Uh, it's really, I've never, there's never been anybody,
[17:05.920 --> 17:11.440]  there've been bundles before many times. There still are on the Mac where you can pay a low fee,
[17:11.440 --> 17:17.840]  like you pay 50 bucks one time and you get a bundle of three or four or $500 worth of apps.
[17:17.840 --> 17:23.600]  And there you go. Um, there've been bundles before Apple several years ago introduced the app store,
[17:23.600 --> 17:27.520]  which is a new thing, but there's never been anything like this, like a subscription service
[17:27.520 --> 17:34.320]  where you get, um, apps from an entire, a wide range of indie Mac developers. So I really hope
[17:34.320 --> 17:40.720]  this thing takes off. I think it's already a great value. Go to set app.com and find out more,
[17:40.720 --> 17:45.840]  no special URL, no code. They just, they just want set up.com. They'll know that they're daring.
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.800]  Yeah. I had heard about this and I couldn't, I didn't know how exactly how it works. That's
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.840]  really cool. It is as simple as it sounds. There is no catch. There is no catch. There's no ads.
[17:55.840 --> 17:59.120]  There's no hook. There's no thing where you have to pay more. There's no, they're not junior
[17:59.120 --> 18:03.520]  versions of the programs. It is exactly what you, if you're thinking it's too good to be true.
[18:04.320 --> 18:10.000]  It's, it's not, there is no catch. The thing I always find with those bundles is they often,
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.320]  um, like developers seem to like put, they, they'll put their previous version into the bundle
[18:16.320 --> 18:19.920]  because they know the new version is coming out soon. So they want to get you to pay the
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.040]  upgrade price when the new version comes out. Um, but this is not, it's, you know, when I,
[18:25.040 --> 18:28.560]  when they first pitched me on it at WWDC, they, you know, they wanted a couple of minutes with
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.520]  me just to, you know, see what I thought my ideas. I was, I got very defensive in the meeting. Not,
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.640]  you know, I like them, they're nice people, but I did because I thought, well, tell me what the
[18:36.640 --> 18:40.480]  catches and I really, my gut feeling was, you know, and they were talking like, we think,
[18:40.480 --> 18:44.800]  you know, we'll sponsor during fireball when we come out and, and maybe the talk show, et cetera.
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.200]  And my thought at the first moment was, I don't know if I'm going to be able to accept this
[18:49.200 --> 18:54.560]  because if there's going to be some kind of ornerous catch, that's going to trick people.
[18:54.560 --> 18:57.520]  I don't, I, you know, that, you know, and there is no catch. I wouldn't take the sponsorship
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.760]  if it were, it's that simple and it's a great deal. So go check them out. Set up set up.com.
[19:01.760 --> 19:09.680]  Uh, we could parlay that into, uh, one of the topics I wanted to talk about
[19:10.240 --> 19:16.640]  this week was, uh, the iPad. This set up is obviously because of the nature of iOS it's
[19:16.640 --> 19:25.520]  Mac only. Um, one of the things I've written about this week and, and, um, was the difference between
[19:25.520 --> 19:32.480]  uh, the iPad as a seven year old platform and the Mac as a seven year old platform
[19:32.480 --> 19:40.800]  back in 1991 and just how much more, uh, powerful the Mac was as a platform after seven years than
[19:40.800 --> 19:47.200]  the iPad is in terms of w I struggled to find a term for the self. I called it self-sufficiency.
[19:47.200 --> 19:54.560]  In other words, can you just use this platform to do everything like, and two examples of things
[19:54.560 --> 20:00.720]  that you can't do on an iPad would be, you can't make iPad apps on an iPad because there's no,
[20:00.720 --> 20:05.920]  there's no X code for iPad or anything like, you know, even similar. Um, and the other example,
[20:05.920 --> 20:10.720]  which I think is a little bit more like, like a head scratcher is that you can't make,
[20:10.720 --> 20:16.160]  you can't, there's no iBooks author for iPad. Like it's clear that I, iBooks author,
[20:16.160 --> 20:24.400]  uh, the, the, that, that format is best on iPad. You, it works on your phone and you can read it
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.680]  on your Mac too, in the iBooks app. But when somebody makes one of these rich interactive
[20:29.680 --> 20:37.120]  iBooks, it is no doubt my mind that it is best on an iPad with touch and with the,
[20:37.120 --> 20:42.960]  the sort of viewing intimacy of the iPad that when you read a book, you know, it's
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.960]  no surprise. This is literally from like the 2010 iPad announcement with Steve jobs, you know,
[20:48.960 --> 20:53.600]  why he had that chair there. It's, it's a device for like sitting back in a chair and reading,
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.920]  which is what you do with a book. Um, but you can't make an iPad book on an iPad because there's
[20:59.920 --> 21:05.680]  no iPad author or what's it, is that what it's called? Uh, iBooks author, iBooks author is only
[21:05.680 --> 21:09.920]  a Mac app. And I think that's a little weird. I think, you know, like it would have been weird
[21:09.920 --> 21:14.880]  if seven years into the Mac, you still couldn't create Mac apps on a Mac and even weirder,
[21:14.880 --> 21:19.520]  if you couldn't create like the documents you want, you want to read on the Mac, on the Mac.
[21:21.760 --> 21:25.920]  Yeah. And it seems like an easy way. I mean, it seems like an easy one to do. I mean,
[21:25.920 --> 21:33.040]  like, not necessarily easy, like from a program programming perspective, but it doesn't, um,
[21:33.040 --> 21:38.960]  really ruin their philosophy to do that. I mean, it works with the philosophy and
[21:38.960 --> 21:47.440]  rather than against it. Uh, I think, yeah. And I think that the X code, the idea of X code on iPad,
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.560]  um, sort of works against that philosophy. I think, I think it will happen eventually.
[21:52.560 --> 21:57.040]  I think, and I, I'm pretty sure Apple is working on it. I'm pretty sure there is an X code for
[21:57.040 --> 22:04.640]  iPad. That's been several years in the works in Cupertino, but it's a lower priority, but I sort
[22:04.640 --> 22:09.120]  of, yeah, I don't have any information on how it works. I just know that there's a team working on
[22:09.120 --> 22:12.240]  something like that, but shocker, there's teams working on just about anything that makes sense
[22:12.240 --> 22:19.520]  like that. Um, but I kind of think though, that it might be a different way of making apps. Like,
[22:19.520 --> 22:27.680]  I don't like the way that X code works now on the Mac is a very, very Unix-y behind the scenes is
[22:27.680 --> 22:35.520]  a very, very Unix-y, uh, thing. It's just a visual front end for a lot of things that run at the
[22:35.520 --> 22:41.280]  command line level, which isn't really, there is a Unix, you know, obviously with the core OS being
[22:41.280 --> 22:46.400]  the same, that's there on iPad, but I'm not quite sure that that works, that that'd work the same
[22:46.400 --> 22:50.720]  way. I think it might be like a more simplified way to make apps. They would be real apps, but
[22:50.720 --> 22:59.280]  more, I don't know, less, less fiddly. Yeah. Yeah. Like flash, sort of maybe, you know, like,
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.880]  like I wouldn't be surprised if I would guess that it would work like this, like that they'd
[23:04.880 --> 23:10.160]  come out with like a new way to make apps. That's a little simpler, a little bit higher level,
[23:10.160 --> 23:19.280]  more abstract. Um, and you could share that same project with X code on the Mac so that the one
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.040]  you're developing on the iPad, you could develop on the Mac. But if you have a more complex app
[23:23.040 --> 23:29.120]  or a legacy app that was already started on X code on the Mac, that not every, not everything
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.160]  you do on the Mac, you could do on the iPad version, but everything you do on the iPad,
[23:32.160 --> 23:37.520]  you could do on the Mac. Does that make sense? I could see that. Um, but I think that the,
[23:37.520 --> 23:43.200]  the iBooks author thing is more telling about Apple's priorities and, and where they see the
[23:43.200 --> 23:51.280]  iPad. I just, cause I think in theory it should be there. And I think one of the reasons it's not
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.320]  is sort of proof on this whole, like, uh, are, are people worried about Apple's commitment to
[23:58.320 --> 24:02.880]  the future of the Mac? I think it's one of those things that, that makes my case, which I've been
[24:02.880 --> 24:07.040]  arguing on the show with the last few guests in favor of, I don't think Apple has, I don't think
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.920]  Apple is any less committed to the Mac than at any point in the past. I think the Mac has a bright
[24:11.920 --> 24:17.520]  future. And I think the fact that they don't have, you know, they see it as fine that iBooks author
[24:17.520 --> 24:24.400]  is Mac only is, is evident to that. Yeah. But when was the last time they updated it?
[24:24.400 --> 24:29.680]  There was a minor update in, I looked, I thought it was like forever ago. Um, like maybe the bigger
[24:29.680 --> 24:34.400]  problem with iBooks author is that they're just not committed to iBooks period, that they sort of
[24:34.400 --> 24:42.320]  that they sort of lost their, uh, corporate, uh, I don't know. I was just going to say stiffy stiffy
[24:43.120 --> 24:51.680]  for iBooks ever since, uh, uh, you know, since they got, I mean, they, they, they came out of
[24:51.680 --> 24:57.840]  the gate. I mean, they even had a special event just for iBooks. It was that weird one-off event
[24:57.840 --> 25:04.080]  at the, uh, what the heck is the name of that museum in New York? I'm terrible with the stuff
[25:04.080 --> 25:11.120]  like that. Anyway, the, the one from Men in Black, I know it was Men in Black. Uh, they had a big,
[25:12.080 --> 25:19.200]  yeah, like in the first Men in Black where, uh, uh, oh, yeah. In the beginning where he's,
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.120]  is it the Guggenheim? That's it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Will Smith chases an alien
[25:25.760 --> 25:28.560]  up there and that's how he kind of draws the attention of the Men in Black.
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.360]  Yeah. Just as a quick aside, Peter, Peter Cohen mentioned this today on Twitter, which blew my
[25:33.360 --> 25:38.960]  mind. Um, did you know that the, you know, the guy, you know, Edgar and then, and then the guy,
[25:38.960 --> 25:47.360]  uh, the, the, the, the bug that puts the skin on the guy's skin on, oh, the, the, the alien,
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.840]  the alien, you know, like, I mean, he's like, he's the, I mean, he's like the main bad guy,
[25:51.840 --> 25:56.960]  right. And he, you know, but he skins that he eats the guy, skins him and puts his skin on
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.400]  that's Vincent Monofrio. I knew that. I had no idea that blew my mind. I was like,
[26:02.400 --> 26:08.000]  oh my God, that's incredible. Yeah. Anyway, I did know that, uh, he doesn't really,
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.160]  I think it's easy. He doesn't really look like him for more than 30 seconds.
[26:13.440 --> 26:19.280]  Yeah, that's, if you listen to him though, it's, you can definitely hear it. It's a good movie.
[26:19.280 --> 26:28.320]  Good movie. I love that movie. I see it as evidence that Apple is committed to the Mac,
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.320]  that they're willing to do it. I would be frustrated though. What I would be frustrated
[26:32.320 --> 26:39.440]  and it's fine by me because I love the Mac. I would rather, I would gladly, if somebody said
[26:39.440 --> 26:45.120]  to me, you can only use out of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, you can only use two of the three for the
[26:45.120 --> 26:49.360]  next year and you can't touch the other one. I would instantly, it would take me, it would take
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.560]  me less time than to say it. I would just say, get rid of the iPad. Mac and iPhone are all I need.
[26:55.120 --> 27:01.680]  iPad is totally a secondary thing for me. Um, I, in fact, I sometimes go like a week and I don't
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.760]  even know where the hell my iPad is. Um, I do like it. I use it mostly. I, I swear my
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.160]  most frequent uses in baseball season, using it as a TV to watch Yankees games.
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.520]  Yeah. Um, yeah, that's probably, I mean, I think entertainment is now, I used to take it when I
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.640]  commuted up to Seattle, I would take it to write with, um, with a keyboard. Uh, but now it's
[27:22.640 --> 27:31.440]  basically, um, it's basically games and, and watching Netflix. Um, anything. So, so for me
[27:31.440 --> 27:38.000]  as somebody who, for my work wants the Mac to remain a thriving platform, uh, it's music to
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.880]  my ears. Like I would actually be slightly more worried if the iPad were more capable because it
[27:42.880 --> 27:48.080]  would at least lend some credence to the idea that Apple thinks the iPad is the future of personal
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.600]  computing. The fact that it isn't, even after seven years, it actually just gives me confidence
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.600]  in their commitment to the Mac, but I'd be frustrated. And it would be angering to me
[27:57.600 --> 28:03.280]  if I were one of the people who's really trying to make a go of, of using the iPad as their
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.960]  full-time platform. You know, the Ben Brooks is and Federico's of the world. I would find that
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.720]  very frustrating because it's seven years. It really makes me think about, you know,
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.880]  this comparison to, um, and for some reason, I mean, seven seems like an arbitrary number,
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.440]  but it's funny because 1991 was when I got my first Mac. I mean, I used one in school before,
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.400]  but I didn't own one. And it's when system seven came out, which I've, you know, it was a big, big
[28:28.400 --> 28:35.200]  landmark in, uh, I mean, I think it was the landmark. Yeah. In the early days, I would say
[28:35.200 --> 28:41.840]  system seven was the division between the early days of Mac OS and the later days of Mac OS. I
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.480]  mean, maybe that's a little arbitrary, but I don't think so. I mean, it was when they changed a whole
[28:46.480 --> 28:51.600]  bunch of things. Like remember when, uh, control panels, I forget how you used to install them in
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.640]  system six. They were sort of more like, like suitcase type things wherein, oh, yeah, that's
[28:56.640 --> 29:03.840]  right. And yeah, third-party ones were weird. And then in system seven control panels became a lot
[29:03.840 --> 29:08.080]  more like apps where they were just self-contained things and you just put them in a folder in your,
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.520]  there was, you know, your system folder at the root level and inside was a folder called control
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.600]  panels and you just put them in there and you wanted to uninstall one. You just took it out
[29:15.600 --> 29:29.600]  and restarted. Um, it was a beautiful system. I disagree. I disagree. I really do. I don't
[29:29.600 --> 29:34.720]  like it when people say that, that the system set from era max crashed all the time. I think the arc
[29:34.720 --> 29:42.480]  of the arc of being a power user on, on system seven era max was you would start running the
[29:42.480 --> 29:47.600]  basic system and you would be like, you'd fall in love with the Mac and then you'd get into the nerd
[29:47.600 --> 29:54.160]  community and you'd start finding out about an it's yeah. And extensions and these extensions
[29:54.160 --> 29:58.240]  could sometimes do like just change like a little slight thing, but it's like, Ooh, I like that.
[29:58.240 --> 30:04.240]  Uh, like now your mouse cursor is a dog, you know? Right. Right. And that's kind of easy.
[30:04.240 --> 30:09.760]  Like all that in it would do is just sort of swap out the system's cursor and point to this other
[30:09.760 --> 30:18.320]  cursor instead. And okay, there you go. Now your cursor is a Smurf. Um, uh, and you know,
[30:18.320 --> 30:22.480]  you'd get more and more, uh, you know, and then all of it, all of a sudden when you go empty
[30:22.480 --> 30:28.640]  trash, Oscar, Oscar, the grouch pops out of your trashcan and sings a song, which was adorable.
[30:28.640 --> 30:34.320]  Like if you didn't have the grouch extension installed on your Mac for at least a month or
[30:34.320 --> 30:43.280]  two, then you've got no soul. But the bro, yeah, but the problem is it leads to such, um, yeah,
[30:43.280 --> 30:51.360]  I mean, I think what happened was like in those early days, we didn't have enough stuff that
[30:51.360 --> 30:56.480]  would, you know, really cause a lot of trouble. And then as more things came out, it became worse
[30:56.480 --> 31:00.240]  and worse and worse. And then, you know, by the time system eight came out, they had to have,
[31:00.240 --> 31:09.360]  uh, basically put a thing in there to manage all your, I remember specifically the one that
[31:09.360 --> 31:13.680]  everybody knew. I mean, at least anybody who did design work had to have an extension called
[31:13.680 --> 31:19.680]  Adobe type manager ATM. Did you had, did you have ATM or no? Cause you didn't. I don't think I did,
[31:19.680 --> 31:27.200]  but I didn't do. So the thing that ATM did was natively, um, the system wanted true type fonts
[31:27.200 --> 31:32.000]  for vector fonts, but almost all of the professional fonts that you could buy were in
[31:32.000 --> 31:41.360]  postscript format. Um, and to get them to look wizzy wig on screen, you needed Adobe type manager,
[31:41.360 --> 31:48.080]  Apple system didn't natively render, um, postscript fonts and you needed postscript
[31:48.080 --> 31:53.760]  fans to do serious work. So you'd have to have ATM installed, but ATM would load first because
[31:53.760 --> 31:57.920]  it starts with an a, I mean it almost certainly load at first and if not, it loaded certainly
[31:57.920 --> 32:05.040]  loaded early, but you had to load it last because it, it would get conflicted with so much stuff.
[32:05.040 --> 32:09.360]  You had to load it last. So everybody, I think it even shipped. I think when you installed it
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.520]  from Adobe, if you bought it straight up legit, I forget even if you had to buy it, maybe they
[32:13.520 --> 32:20.400]  gave it away, but the way Adobe gave it to you, the file was named like tilde ATM or I forget
[32:20.400 --> 32:24.720]  what character it was before it, but it was some kind of punctuation character that in
[32:24.720 --> 32:31.600]  Apple's sorting algorithm at the time would load last. And that, that was a little, anyway,
[32:31.600 --> 32:36.400]  in my opinion, the curve of being a Mac power user in the nineties was you'd, you'd start
[32:36.400 --> 32:40.160]  getting more and more extensions. And remember when you'd boot and you'd see the, every time
[32:40.160 --> 32:44.080]  an extension loaded, you'd see the icon during the boot sequence and then you'd get a second
[32:44.080 --> 32:51.920]  line of them, a third line. So it was like a bell curve. You'd start getting no, no, no.
[32:51.920 --> 32:56.640]  Then it would just stop. You did like one of them would load and it would just stop and you'd be
[32:56.640 --> 33:03.920]  like, Oh, that is shit. And then you do, you would do, I mean, everybody remembers, you got
[33:03.920 --> 33:09.760]  to remember, how did you, how did you start up and not load extensions? Of course. Right.
[33:09.760 --> 33:12.800]  You didn't even have to, you probably had to think more about it to say your hand probably
[33:12.800 --> 33:18.080]  already went to the shift key, right? It was just, you just had muscle memory of how to
[33:18.080 --> 33:22.080]  restart your Mac with the shift key down. No, but then what would happen is you'd max out
[33:22.080 --> 33:25.680]  and you'd be so proud of how many extensions you have, but your Mac would be unstable.
[33:25.680 --> 33:30.640]  And then all of a sudden you'd, you'd, the light would shine and you'd say more extensions
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.960]  is not a good thing, fewer extensions, and you should run it closer and closer as close
[33:34.960 --> 33:41.120]  as you can to the configuration that ships with like a Mac out of the box from Apple
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.920]  without any other extensions was always an extremely stable device. Now I'm not saying
[33:45.920 --> 33:49.120]  that it never crashed. I mean, but usually it was completely an application's fault.
[33:49.120 --> 33:52.640]  The system itself was stable. And so by the end of it, you know, by the end of the classic
[33:52.640 --> 33:57.840]  era, I had as few system extensions as possible. Everyone was one that I felt like I could
[33:57.840 --> 34:06.480]  not do without and from a reputable vendor. Yeah. And you develop sets. Right. With conflict
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.400]  catcher. Because like, yeah, if I'm going to do like publishing today and then I'll
[34:10.400 --> 34:14.560]  boot with my publishing set and if I'm going to play like a game and I need some sort of
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.400]  3d thing and a minimal and the other thing, sometimes if you wanted to play a game as
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.200]  you reboot with a minimal set, just to free up as much Ram as possible, keep it, keep
[34:23.200 --> 34:30.720]  it as light as possible. Ram double. Oh man. I love the Mac. I thought I love the classic
[34:30.720 --> 34:36.640]  Mac. I think it still is overall a simpler conceptual design than Mac OS 10. I think
[34:36.640 --> 34:42.240]  Mac OS 10 is way too fiddly and exposes way too many goofy bits. I, you know, iOS clearly
[34:42.240 --> 34:46.960]  takes the cake and, and, and yeah, I've become comfortable with the goofy bits at this point,
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.240]  but there is a, there is a, I mean, the fact that you can, you can just drag a system folder,
[34:52.240 --> 35:02.240]  um, from Mac to Mac and reboot it. It was pretty cool. Um, but there, there were definitely
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.480]  there were definitely some parts of the classic Mac system that you cannot defend as elegant
[35:08.480 --> 35:13.920]  design. Like for example, by the nineties, this is just an ex in the eighties when it
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.400]  came out, it made perfect sense. But in the nineties, by the, by night, it should have
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.240]  been fixed with system seven, but I know why it wasn't. Cause the legacy reasons that they
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.880]  were carrying all this baggage, but the fact that you had to allocate memory to the programs
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.720]  with get info. Oh my God. For people who weren't a classic Mac OS users, what you would do
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.680]  is you'd find any application and you'd go get info and in the info, it would have a
[35:37.680 --> 35:42.720]  text field where it would say how much Ram was allocated. And so developers, when they
[35:42.720 --> 35:48.560]  ship their apps would buy, you know, typically they, they would have a basic, they would
[35:48.560 --> 35:52.720]  have, you know, they would ship it with a pre-configured, like when you first downloaded
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.560]  the app or installed it, it would have a default that was defined by the developer. So Photoshop
[35:58.560 --> 36:05.440]  by default would take a lot more Ram than, you know, a simple, a very simple lightweight
[36:05.440 --> 36:09.200]  app that just, I don't know, capitalizes all letters for you or something like that.
[36:09.760 --> 36:13.760]  But you could, as the user, it was just a text field and get info. You could give an
[36:13.760 --> 36:22.160]  app more or less as needed. It does not seem like something that the computer for the rest
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.960]  of us should, should force you to do. Yeah, really? Yeah. All right. I can't defend that.
[36:26.960 --> 36:32.880]  Yeah. And I can remember like, you know, not that windows 95 was greater, but you know,
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.560]  at least like some, some level of protected memory, uh, was, was the one thing that I
[36:38.560 --> 36:45.200]  was like, Oh man, that would be nice to the very, the very, the very best Mac apps had
[36:45.200 --> 36:48.880]  programmers who were clever enough to get around it. So Photoshop at a certain point
[36:48.880 --> 36:55.440]  used to use a Ram disc, its own Ram disc. And so you didn't have to, you could open
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.400]  big files in Photoshop and not have to really worry about having given it enough Ram. It
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.080]  would do it on its own. And BB edit famously was able to operate with a very small, it
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.560]  was like the, the, the instructions for BB edit were do not screw with the default amount
[37:10.560 --> 37:17.280]  of Ram. Uh, it doesn't need much. And BB edit had a, uh, a brilliant scheme where you
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.800]  could open files, you know, as big as the text file is, is how much Ram BB edit needs
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.040]  to, to display it. But it could be way more than what the app had because it would allocate
[37:27.040 --> 37:32.320]  the memory outside of that allocation that you got from get info. It managed stone memory
[37:32.320 --> 37:39.920]  separately, which was fantastic. Um, but neither here nor there. Uh, I don't know. What do
[37:39.920 --> 37:45.440]  you, I would be frustrated if I were an iPad first user. I guess it really depends on what
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.760]  you're, I mean, it just depends on what you're doing. I think there's, there's definitely,
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.080]  there are definitely things that I do that would, I would find frustrating, but I don't
[37:54.080 --> 38:01.520]  do them that often. I think I'm somebody who probably could do most of my work on an iPad.
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.000]  There's no way. Um, cause it's mostly, I'm mostly I'm writing and then I'm taking it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.880]  And I use Ulysses, which is one of those apps in setup and that's in setup. And, um, I,
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.880]  I write it up and then I take it and I put it someplace, you know, I usually, I either,
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.880]  I either take the file and send it to somebody or a, um, post it into, uh, some sort of web based
[38:22.880 --> 38:30.320]  CMS. So how would you be recording this podcast? Well, that's a, that's a, that's one thing,
[38:30.320 --> 38:38.000]  right? You can't, I mean, you can't report record podcasts on iOS devices. I have not done it.
[38:38.000 --> 38:41.200]  Yeah. It's just, but it's jumping through a whole bunch of hoops. Whereas there's like 10
[38:41.200 --> 38:47.280]  different, there's 10 different easy ways to record a podcast on a Mac at least. Right. You
[38:47.280 --> 38:52.880]  just open, I'm using two separate ones right now. Uh, yeah, no, I guess I'm just using one,
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.160]  but that's, you're probably smarter than me. Well, it's because it's because of that problem,
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.400]  but it's like, you can record, you just have these other apps running and you know, or I use
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.680]  call recorder, which is an extension for Skype. And there's no way that you can, uh, install an
[39:07.680 --> 39:14.160]  extension for an app on iPad. Um, yeah. And there's just no, I don't know. It's just another example
[39:14.160 --> 39:18.080]  of the type of thing. And I know that I've listened to a couple of podcasts where, um,
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.120]  there's like a web based thing that somebody is working on. I forget the name of it. I heard
[39:23.120 --> 39:29.040]  Snell talking about it recently. Um, Oh, is it edit? Yeah. But I think you can like record too.
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.280]  It's like a way that like a group of people can get on and you just use, I think it's ridiculous
[39:33.280 --> 39:38.640]  that the answer to getting people to record podcasts on an iPad is to use a web app instead
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.520]  of a native app because the gist of it is that all you need is the microphone then and the server
[39:43.520 --> 39:48.880]  side does the recording, you know, like it records that the web app records little bits and as you go
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.760]  keep sending it to the server. So like if the connection breaks or whatever, it's not, you know,
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.480]  you don't lose the whole, you only lose like a couple seconds at a time. Um, I think it's
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.760]  ridiculous that it's not a local thing that the solution is to do it all on the web. Anyway,
[40:03.760 --> 40:09.360]  the gist of it is that in the midst of all of this months long, uh, Sturm and drung over,
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.760]  Oh, I think Apple is, I think Apple's abandoning the Mac. I think they're trying to force us all
[40:13.760 --> 40:18.800]  to use iPads. And in the midst of all this, I've been more or less on this side of, I don't think
[40:18.800 --> 40:26.320]  so. I really think the Mac is fine, but I think lost in this is the opposite, which is the iPad
[40:26.320 --> 40:30.320]  is nowhere near as powerful as it should be at this point in time. You should be able to record
[40:30.320 --> 40:36.240]  a, you know, have record a podcast, you know, through native apps. There should be a way to
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.280]  have two apps at a time using the microphone so that one could be Skype sending the communication
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.400]  over the internet and the other one can be a call recorder type thing. There's no way, there's no
[40:46.400 --> 40:53.840]  reason you shouldn't be able to do that. Uh, yeah, I, I don't know. I'd be frustrated. I think that
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.480]  the, is it, is it, I mean, is it still just the thing of like walking and chewing down at the
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.280]  same time or do we keep coming back to that particular? I don't know. I don't know. You know,
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.200]  maybe, um, I think the other thing too, I've been thinking about this a lot lately too, is where
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.880]  does this idea that the, that the iPad is that Apple is going to push the sweep the Mac aside
[41:14.880 --> 41:23.680]  in favor of the iPad. I think a large part comes down to what Tim Cook said when they debuted
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.840]  the iPad pro where Tim Cook said, I don't have it in front of me, but it's something to the effect
[41:29.840 --> 41:35.520]  of, I mean, he said he doesn't use a Mac. He never said that. He's never said that. He has said that
[41:35.520 --> 41:43.360]  he, I think he said that he's traveled only with an iPad. Um, but like, like when he went to, um,
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.320]  or not when he went to, when he invited ABC news into his, his office in Cupertino to do an
[41:48.320 --> 41:54.640]  interview about the FBI, um, San Bernard Bernardino case, there's a big iMac on his desk. There's a
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.280]  5k iMac on his desk. So, I mean, he's got one on his desk. I can't, if he didn't use it, I can't
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.800]  imagine why he'd have it on his desk. Um, I find it very hard to believe that Tim Cook does not use
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.600]  a Mac. I would be shocked if he actually said that. He has said that he travels only with an
[42:09.600 --> 42:13.760]  iPad. He has said that he thinks there's many people, many users who can get by with only an
[42:13.760 --> 42:21.840]  iPad. But I think it was his words that this is our, the best, uh, like example of our vision for
[42:21.840 --> 42:27.440]  the future of personal computing. You know, it said something to the effect of that. And I think
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.120]  that it was, I, if you take it literally, it sort of sounds like, yeah, he's saying that, that this
[42:33.120 --> 42:37.360]  is going to be the future and everything else like the, you know, which would include the Mac is,
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.840]  is by the wayside. I think he was just selling the iPad Pro. I don't really think he meant it
[42:41.840 --> 42:48.480]  that way. I think that, yeah, I think that the better, I mean, the PR the problem is that,
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.280]  you know, you have that, you have that statement, you have some, at least, you know, I think there's
[42:51.280 --> 42:54.560]  a, there's a, at least a couple of statements that he's, he's made about stuff like that.
[42:54.560 --> 42:59.760]  And then, um, and then the, you know, you have a year, like 2016 where they don't really update
[42:59.760 --> 43:05.120]  the Mac very much and they have the desktop ones are just sitting there. I think that,
[43:05.760 --> 43:10.400]  so the convergence of those two things makes people think, but I don't think that it's an
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.240]  example of, you know, not right. They didn't update the iPad. They haven't updated the iPad
[43:14.240 --> 43:21.760]  in over a year either. Right. Well, didn't the, the, the 12th, what are the, the pro,
[43:21.760 --> 43:28.080]  the smaller pro came out in April, right? No. Yeah. Yeah. Last April. So it'll be,
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.160]  if they have our March, I guess it'll be, it'll be a year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They didn't do it
[43:32.160 --> 43:37.040]  in the fall, which they've, uh, right. And yeah, like, and so the 12 inch or 13 inch iPad Pro
[43:37.040 --> 43:42.000]  hasn't been updated now in over a year. It came out alongside the, the iPhone last year,
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  or at least it was debuted alongside the iPhone and came out in October or whatever.
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.520]  Um, but that's been unchanged for over a year. So I don't think I, I, I think that lack of
[43:51.520 --> 43:55.200]  updates to hardware should not, are not necessarily indicative of their commitment to,
[43:56.080 --> 44:01.040]  um, to the platform. I think that the annual update to the OS is a better sign of their
[44:01.040 --> 44:08.160]  commitment to the platform. Yeah. I don't know what the explanation is, but I'd be frustrated.
[44:10.640 --> 44:16.080]  Um, Hey, what the Ulysses was my description of it as sort of like an IDE for writing. Is that,
[44:16.080 --> 44:23.360]  is that a good description? Like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, uh, to me, I used to write
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.360]  in BB edit all the time. Um, and I mostly write in markdown. And so, uh, but I wanted something
[44:29.360 --> 44:36.160]  that was better at arranging the files. Um, so Ulysses is like that. Um, it gives you,
[44:36.160 --> 44:40.560]  you know, you can create folders and projects and stuff like that. Um, you know, it's,
[44:40.560 --> 44:46.800]  it's somewhere in between, you know, it's like between BB edit and, um, Scrivener, you know,
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.600]  it's not as fancy as Scrivener. It doesn't have, uh, you know, things for writing scripts and
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.400]  things like that. You can't put, I mean, you can, you can't put pictures in and like, you know,
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.160]  scrapbook stuff that when you're building characters and things, you know, things to
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.920]  write books, if you're writing a, like a full book, you probably want to use Scrivener, but
[45:03.920 --> 45:09.360]  you could write a full book in Ulysses too. And it has an iPad version and they sync, right?
[45:09.360 --> 45:13.840]  Yeah. Yep. Yep. And that's the nice thing. I mean, and I, yeah, so it works on the iPhone,
[45:13.840 --> 45:19.120]  iPad, and on the Mac. It's always been one of those apps that sort of appeals to me,
[45:19.120 --> 45:23.440]  but never, it never pushes me over the edge. It took me a while. It really took me a while
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.960]  to get used to it. I had been using BB edit for years. Um, and I couldn't get used to it. Um,
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.720]  but then finally, I think it was like one of the recent updates. So I've been using it for
[45:37.920 --> 45:44.560]  two years, a year and a half, something like that. Um, and very happy with it. I still use
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.400]  BB edit for certain things, but you know, I know Apple has done, Apple has some of their
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.360]  apps that work great across platform. I think that the, the, I have complaints about the Mac
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.800]  version of photos being not Mac like enough and sort of, it just feels like an app written by
[45:58.800 --> 46:05.920]  iOS programmers, not Mac programmers. Um, but in terms of actually sinking and having photos that
[46:05.920 --> 46:12.160]  I take on my iPhone, just magically appear on my Mac and changes, you know, I edit, I straighten,
[46:12.160 --> 46:16.720]  you know, I, one of the things I, I mean, I take thousands of photos a year and I'm like,
[46:16.720 --> 46:23.600]  not serious, but like semi-serious, you know, I own like a $4,000 Canon SLR, uh, you know,
[46:23.600 --> 46:29.600]  with counting the lenses. Uh, I cannot take a straight picture. I mean, 20 years into a avid
[46:29.600 --> 46:35.680]  amateur photography hobby, I stop every, almost every photo I take the horizon is crooked.
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.040]  So like straightening images is just, I do it all the time and I love the straighten it on. It
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.720]  doesn't matter which device you straighten it on. There it is. It's synced up to your iCloud. I love
[46:44.720 --> 46:49.760]  it. Um, and the I works suite now that they've, you know, they had hit the reset button, you know,
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.200]  for years, there was like the iOS versions, which had a certain file format and the Mac versions,
[46:55.200 --> 47:00.640]  which had file formats that couldn't round trip because it used features and they hit the reset
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.240]  button. And the, the only way to do it is to sort of set the Mac back, but they've gotten them to
[47:06.240 --> 47:11.120]  the point now where most of what the Mac apps could always do, they can do everywhere now,
[47:11.120 --> 47:15.280]  you know? So the, the I works apps are a good example, but Ulysses just shows that third-party
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.720]  developers. And I think in a lot of ways are better are doing a better job of making the iPad
[47:20.720 --> 47:30.560]  appear to the Mac of a peer, uh, not appear, uh, a sibling, a full fledged sibling to the Mac
[47:30.560 --> 47:34.480]  than Apple is, you know, and with iBooks author as, as, as exhibit day.
[47:34.480 --> 47:42.160]  Yeah. It's a fairly, I mean, it's a relatively simple app. I'm not trying to,
[47:42.160 --> 47:46.640]  that's probably, that came out wrong. I mean, that's one of the things I like about it. It's
[47:46.640 --> 47:50.160]  not, there aren't, there aren't like a huge number of bells and whistles and, and it, you know,
[47:50.160 --> 47:54.720]  it lets you get into the writing, which is what I want to do. Um, but it gives me enough flexibility
[47:54.720 --> 48:03.200]  in terms of arranging things that it's, it's got exactly what I want. Um, so it, it, you know,
[48:03.200 --> 48:10.080]  it has, it doesn't have to do anything super freaky, like, um, you know, stuff that's not
[48:10.080 --> 48:17.360]  allowed on iOS. You know who else is doing an amazing job on, on treating the iPad as a,
[48:17.360 --> 48:25.680]  as a first-class platform for creative people is Omni group. Yeah. Yeah. Again, I, I, I think
[48:25.680 --> 48:30.720]  better than Apple. I really do. Oh, yeah. Well, I think, yeah, I mean, they're like,
[48:30.720 --> 48:38.000]  they're the at the forefront and they made that decision. Um, and I mean, I'm assuming that it's
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.880]  working out well enough for them. I hope so. My understanding is, yeah, but I, but they really,
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.160]  and I think that they did it in a way where the Mac versions of their apps never suffered. Like
[48:50.160 --> 48:56.240]  they, the Mac versions of Omni apps never had like an 18 month period where they were, uh, like one
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.520]  step forward, two steps back to get iOS compatibility. So it really, I mean, I would
[49:01.520 --> 49:08.080]  hold them up as a better example than Apple of, of how to get, uh, you know, iPad versions and
[49:08.080 --> 49:14.880]  Mac versions that just work together. Um, yeah. And they, did you see that, uh, Ken Case founder,
[49:14.880 --> 49:20.640]  co-founder of, of the army group CEO, he had his annual, uh, you know, here's what, you know,
[49:20.640 --> 49:27.120]  here's what 2016 was for us. And here's what we're looking at in 2017. Did you see that post?
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.920]  Um, I'll put it in the show notes. I swear to God, I'm typing it in right now. Here we go.
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.000]  Uh, the, one of the, it, I won't go into details on the app by app basis,
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.560]  but one of the things that was fascinating about it is that, um, they have hired
[49:46.560 --> 49:54.320]  Sal Soya Han, who was formerly a long time Apple, uh, evangelist for, uh, automation technologies,
[49:54.320 --> 50:02.160]  I believe was what his group was called, which was Apple script and automator and, uh, you know,
[50:02.800 --> 50:11.200]  stuff in that area. Um, and Sal left Apple, uh, was it early December, somewhere around there.
[50:11.200 --> 50:18.240]  And, um, seemingly, you know, the, the details are not public, but it's, you know, the gist of it.
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.960]  And, and Sal had a piece that he wrote for Mac stories. Uh, you know, it's suggesting that
[50:24.960 --> 50:29.920]  Apple seems to think that extensions are the future of automation, meaning like this little
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.760]  sharing sheet things that you have now where you can, uh, like if you have the, you know,
[50:35.760 --> 50:40.320]  I have like a, uh, I use a bookmarking service called pinboard and I have an app called pinner
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.720]  on my iPhone. And when I have a URL and go to share it, I get a little extension up there that
[50:44.720 --> 50:50.320]  says, add, add to pinboard. And I can just tap that. And it goes that, that sort of thing is
[50:50.320 --> 50:54.880]  the future of automation. And it's not like scripting or something like that. Um, which
[50:55.760 --> 51:00.400]  extensions are great, but it's a totally separate thing. It's like saying it really is like saying
[51:00.400 --> 51:04.480]  the future of citrus is apples. You know, it's like, uh, that's not citrus, you know,
[51:05.520 --> 51:08.960]  you know what I mean? Apples are great, but we need oranges and lemons and limes. I mean,
[51:08.960 --> 51:12.000]  you can't, you know, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? If you make a martini,
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.200]  you can't put a goddamn apple peel in it. Uh, you need a lemon peel. Uh, I mean,
[51:17.200 --> 51:25.280]  that's a terrible analogy because, but anyway, anyway, Ken case, uh, revealed in his,
[51:25.280 --> 51:31.200]  you're in a review thing that the Omni group has been consulting with Sal, um, since he left Apple,
[51:31.200 --> 51:34.800]  like, and they're smart. It's just one of those ways where the Omni group is so smart where it's
[51:34.800 --> 51:39.040]  like Sal says, uh, well, after 20 years, I'm leaving Apple and the Omni group was like,
[51:39.040 --> 51:46.160]  quick, let's get them. Right. Yeah. Well, right. I mean, there's gotta be a bunch of other
[51:46.160 --> 51:49.840]  companies like, Oh shit, we should have, we should get in line. Now that, I mean,
[51:49.840 --> 51:53.440]  now that you mentioned that, I remember that. I remember that, um, hearing about that at any
[51:53.440 --> 51:58.160]  rate. And I don't think, I mean, they don't, they haven't really like shown their hand yet. Right.
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.080]  But they have a, they've revealed a demo anyway. They've got engineers working on, um,
[52:02.080 --> 52:09.840]  or at least an engineer, uh, working on a, a cross-platform scripting system for the Omni group
[52:09.840 --> 52:17.280]  apps. Um, uh, but it's now, how is that going to work? You know, there's like on the Mac,
[52:17.280 --> 52:21.520]  there's the, the Apple script is there. It's part of the system. I mean, it's really the OSA,
[52:21.520 --> 52:26.560]  but it's Apple events are part of the system and there's a standard way for developers to add
[52:26.560 --> 52:33.040]  scripting support to their apps. And that the same way that, you know, the same things that you do
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.760]  as a developer to make your app scriptable by Apple script or JavaScript, which is now a first
[52:37.760 --> 52:43.360]  class officially supported language for scripting apps on Mac also is along the lines of doing this.
[52:43.360 --> 52:47.520]  It's the same work that you have to do to get automator support for your app. So you can make
[52:47.520 --> 52:56.480]  your app part of an automator, um, process. Um, you can't do it. There's no Apple events on Mac.
[52:56.480 --> 53:01.120]  On iOS. So if, and, and there's no real alternative to it. So the Omni group is doing
[53:01.120 --> 53:06.320]  their own thing. Um, I forget what they're calling it, but it's based on JavaScript
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.320]  because part of the reason that, you know, developers that it's tricky for developers
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.800]  to do something like this is that the rules for the app store on iOS or that you can't add
[53:15.440 --> 53:20.960]  an interpreter to your app. In other words, you can't have an app that makes apps,
[53:20.960 --> 53:26.960]  even if it runs within itself. But what you can do is use the system version of JavaScript
[53:26.960 --> 53:31.440]  that comes with WebKit. And so you can use JavaScript, the JavaScript that comes with
[53:31.440 --> 53:36.560]  the system. Um, and presumably that's what Apple or Omni is doing because they're saying that their,
[53:36.560 --> 53:43.360]  their, uh, their scripting technology is based on, on, uh, JavaScript. But the gist of it is,
[53:43.360 --> 53:46.800]  and there's an example script that they show an animation of that. I guess Sal wrote,
[53:46.800 --> 53:52.320]  uh, we make a rectangle and then you'd make a circle out of the rectangle and you color it
[53:52.320 --> 53:56.720]  green and then position it at a certain point. It's, it's, he's scripting their,
[53:56.720 --> 54:01.200]  their drawing app, Omni graphical, and that these same scripts are going to be cross-platform Mac
[54:01.200 --> 54:07.520]  and iOS, which is really, we haven't had that. It's great, but it, it, to me, I read this and
[54:07.520 --> 54:13.200]  I think this is great and it makes, you know, uh, it, it helps establish Omni is like the leading
[54:13.200 --> 54:17.840]  indie Apple developer, Apple platform developer today. But this is the sort of thing that should
[54:17.840 --> 54:21.680]  be coming from Apple, not from a third party developer. It should be the same thing for it,
[54:21.680 --> 54:25.440]  for all apps. I mean, that's one of the reasons Apple script, and I say what you want about the
[54:25.440 --> 54:30.400]  language, but one of the reasons it's a great technology was before Apple script in the early
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.520]  days of the Mac, there were any app that wanted to have like an automation. I mean, we used to call
[54:35.520 --> 54:41.360]  macros. Nobody uses the word macro anymore, but it's the same idea, right? But any app that had
[54:41.360 --> 54:46.400]  macros or, or something like that had their own thing, it was all, you know,
[54:47.760 --> 54:53.680]  That's how I, that's how I got into, that's how I like, I started my, my career in it was
[54:53.680 --> 54:59.520]  basically doing macros. So they, I, you know, I came to work in a financial department and they
[54:59.520 --> 55:03.920]  had all these spreadsheets that they were doing, you know, all this stuff manually. And so I started
[55:03.920 --> 55:11.680]  out just by taking, taking Excel and just, and doing like arrowing, having an arrow over arrow
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.920]  through cells, instead of like really learning. And before I learned how to do any kind of
[55:15.920 --> 55:22.560]  programming, it was just like down one cell, down one cell, down one cell, over, over, over copy,
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.520]  you know, like that kind of thing. Just like very deliberately telling it exactly what I would do
[55:27.520 --> 55:35.360]  by hand. And then slowly working into like learning, you know, visual basic for applications.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.920]  Like, that's my, that's my nightmare background.
[55:40.480 --> 55:45.760]  Well, I forget the name of it. There was a prior to, well, it was a competitor for years
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.120]  with BB edit. I think it was called alpha. There was a programming text editor for the Mac and it
[55:51.120 --> 55:57.600]  used TCL as a scripting language, which was, it wasn't like its own invention of the language,
[55:57.600 --> 56:01.280]  but what they did, it was an open source scripting language that I think has largely fallen out of
[56:01.280 --> 56:06.720]  favor in recent decades. But, you know, it's a sort of scripting language where anybody could
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.320]  look at it and sort of get the gist of, oh yeah, you know, I mean, it wasn't like a weird language.
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.280]  It was like, oh yeah, I kind of see what's going on here. But they embedded the interpreter in
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.600]  their app and no other Mac app used TCL. So anything you did that you were scripting, it
[56:19.600 --> 56:24.960]  was only within the text editor itself. There was no way to, to do something with text and then send
[56:24.960 --> 56:31.120]  it to Excel or whatever. Apple, you know, having it as a system level technology is what made that
[56:31.120 --> 56:37.440]  possible. And, and the fact that iOS doesn't have it and the fact that it doesn't, you know,
[56:37.440 --> 56:41.920]  reading between the lines of what Sal has, has said publicly since he left,
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.280]  doesn't seem like it's in the plans either. So I think that's kind of worrisome.
[56:45.280 --> 56:51.760]  Yeah. And it would, again, another sign that it would make me angry if I were an iOS user.
[56:51.760 --> 56:59.040]  What? All right, let's take a break and tell you about our good friends at Squarespace.
[56:59.040 --> 57:03.760]  Next time you need a website, just go to Squarespace and give it like an hour and
[57:03.760 --> 57:08.640]  just start making a website there. Click a template, find the basic template of the type
[57:08.640 --> 57:13.840]  of site you need. And they just, they have things to pick from. So like, let's say you're making a
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.480]  blog, he would tell you, here's, here's, you know, start with a blog, or let's say you want to sell
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.440]  stuff like somebody, you know, is making, you know, like a, you know, a bunch of crafts or
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.800]  something like that. And they want to sell them. You just say, I want to build a store. And they,
[57:26.800 --> 57:31.600]  it just starts with that as the sort of, and then you pick styles, like what type of
[57:32.480 --> 57:37.440]  fonts and colors and stuff like that. They have a slew of professionally designed templates. I mean,
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.000]  I don't know how many, but so many, so many that you don't have to worry about the fact that like,
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.880]  oh, if I go to Squarespace, it's going to look like a Squarespace site. It's like,
[57:44.880 --> 57:47.920]  they have so many templates. You don't have to worry about that. It's, you can make something
[57:47.920 --> 57:54.560]  that looks totally original and you just click and drag. You just drag which components you want.
[57:55.200 --> 58:02.480]  It's very visual. You don't have to do any coding whatsoever. It is a completely drag and drop
[58:02.480 --> 58:10.400]  visual tool, very much as we talk about these retro things, like in the way that Illustrator
[58:10.400 --> 58:17.120]  never, ever, ever made you write PostScript to get vector art. Squarespace never makes you see
[58:17.120 --> 58:23.680]  HTML or CSS or JavaScript to make a totally dynamic modern website that it has everything
[58:23.680 --> 58:27.920]  you'd want on a modern website, including scalability from phones to tablets to big
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.760]  27 inch displays. Could not be a better way to do it. And they handle everything. They handle
[58:33.760 --> 58:38.160]  everything. You can register your domain with them to get your domain name. They host it all.
[58:38.160 --> 58:41.760]  You don't need a separate hosting account. It's not like you build a website with Squarespace and
[58:41.760 --> 58:46.080]  you get a folder full of files that you have to upload and install on a hosting account. They
[58:46.080 --> 58:51.600]  host it. They host it. It's just all self-contained from getting a domain to hosting it,
[58:51.600 --> 58:57.520]  to showing you traffic and stats and great analytics, way better. Squarespace analytics
[58:57.520 --> 59:00.960]  are so much better than anything I have it during Fireball. It's absolutely embarrassing.
[59:02.560 --> 59:07.440]  You can lock down your next move with a unique domain, your own website that they will host,

[59:44.640 --> 59:46.800]  No. I wish I hadn't.
[59:48.240 --> 59:53.120]  I know. I quipped that I was the real winner because I did not watch the Super Bowl.
[59:53.120 --> 59:57.840]  I wish I hadn't. Wow. As somebody who put a little scratch on the Atlanta Falcons.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:04.720]  That's heartbreaking. Yeah. No, it's just, it's really two teams that I just don't,
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.800]  I didn't care about at all. So I'm, I just, and I thought I can watch the, you know,
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.560]  I can watch the commercials later. I wrote a little bit. Well, here's something,
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.400]  here's a story that's came out. They're not new, but two stories came out in the last two days.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:31.040]  There's a fast company story by, let me get his name, uh, Mark Sullivan. It came out yesterday
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.000]  and headline why Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone will likely cost more than a thousand dollars.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.680]  And the gist of it is that according to this guy who says he has, he has a source with knowledge
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.240]  of Apple's plans. That's how he attributes it. It doesn't say where the source is from. Is it from
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:52.320]  Apple? Is it from the supply chain? Is it a bartender at, uh, BJ's and Cupertino? I don't know,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:59.200]  but this guy has a source and he says that what Apple is going to do next year is come out with
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:05.680]  the iPhone seven S and the iPhone seven S plus, which would be exactly in line with the past
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.920]  couple of years where they just take the new number version and then add an ass. I mean,
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.000]  it doesn't say it's going to be called the S, but they're going to look exactly like the seven and
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.360]  seven plus not like, sort of like it, like the way that the seven sorta looks like the iPhone six
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.960]  and success. Um, but that they are also going to introduce a new, even though they're going to come
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.000]  out with a seven S and seven S plus with the new stuff, they're also going to come out with an all
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.320]  new industrial design, um, with the that's, and it'll have an OLED display and it's going to go
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.760]  edge to edge and it's going to be 5.8 inches instead of five and it's going to cost more.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.520]  So even though they're going to introduce the seven S and seven S plus, they're going to,
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.440]  instead of having them debut at the top of the line, there's going to be this new iPhone that's
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.120]  going to debut at the top of the line at an even higher price, starting at a more than a thousand
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:02.560]  dollars. Uh, now that's not really the thousand dollar thing. Isn't ridiculous. Cause if you buy
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.600]  the high end iPhone seven plus it is like $969. So it's already, they've already the top of the line,
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:17.040]  most expensive iPhone is already roughly a thousand dollars. So it's not preposterous
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:23.200]  that the starting point of a new high end one would be a thousand dollars. Um, and so this is
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.840]  a five point and this is the eight. Well, they're saying they don't know the name and he, they're
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.440]  saying that even says, which is what, which is what we've maybe heard of as the pro. I think
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.640]  iPhone pro, if they did, this was actually the more likely name in my opinion, but we can get to
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.000]  that. Cause he also says the new 5.8 inch phone will probably be called the iPhone eight, but this
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.840]  is Mark Sullivan writing, but some believe Apple will call it the parentheses far cooler sounding
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:56.480]  and parentheses iPhone X. I don't iPhone X. I can, I think that they, I would hope that they
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:04.480]  learned their lesson by calling Mac OS X, spelling it with an X because for years I think that a
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.760]  majority of people call pronounced it. I Mac OS X in like, I would do that by mistake occasionally.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:18.240]  And I knew, I knew what it was called. What, what was the other one that they used to,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:24.000]  Oh, the, I touch the calling, the calling the iPod touch the, I touch, right. There's way
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.200]  more people who call it the, I touch than, than iPod touch. Uh, I think calling it iPhone
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.640]  capital X. I mean, who knows? I guess if they do that, they should actually pronounce it iPhone X.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.280]  If they're expecting people to pronounce it on 10, then no, that's a, that's a big mistake. I was,
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:46.160]  when I read that, I was thinking it's iPhone X, not 10. Um, if they did call it iPhone X,
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.160]  but the thing is like, where do you go from there? Cause he can't add an iPhone.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.440]  I can't add an S because it would sound like you're saying excess.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:03.120]  Yeah. Uh, yeah. You can't put the S in front of it. Cause then it would be like iPhone sex.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:16.160]  Right. Uh, I, uh, anyway, the second story is X, um, iPhone, uh, FX, two FX.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:24.000]  Yeah. Just go back to 1991 and call it the iPhone two FX, uh, the iPhone,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.520]  the iPhone performer today came out KGI's Ming Chi Kuo, the analyst who has the best sources
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:38.240]  in the supply. He reports from China, I think, or at least from Asia. And clearly his sources
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.800]  have always been in the supply chain, the supply chain that fills his stuff. He's been saying this
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.400]  for a while. This isn't new, but he's, you know, this idea that they're going to do new ones of
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:55.840]  the exact same form factor as the iPhone seven and seven plus, and this new thing with 5.8 inch
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:03.040]  diagonal OLED display that might curve at the edges. And it is more of a chinless forehead
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.800]  lists edge to edge top to bottom design with a touch home home button. That's actually embedded
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.120]  in the screen and this virtual, not really a button, et cetera. These aren't new rumors,
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.040]  but he reiterated, this is pretty much, I don't think anything in this report contradicts, um,
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.640]  anything in Mark Sullivan's report. So I don't know if they have the same sources or similar
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.600]  ones, but there's nothing really conflicting. So it is that there's a little bit of a, where
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:39.920]  there's smoke, there's fire aspect to this. I think Sullivan's source might be cool.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.040]  I think that that's a very high possibility. I think you, I would actually bet on that,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:52.240]  but quo has a pretty good track record. Yeah. I mean, you know, he's not right. Although I,
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.080]  although I think, I don't know, maybe it's possible, but usually these, I mean,
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:01.280]  one of the reasons why they do these reports is to advertise for their firm. So, um, it seems
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:08.320]  unlikely that he would, uh, speak off the record like that. Well, but it's telling though that he
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:13.280]  came out with the report the next day. I don't know. Uh, you know what, here's a pet peeve.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:18.720]  I've said this before publicly. I hate this. This is one of the ways that I wish if I had a magic
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.160]  wand that I would wave, it would be that I hate when these sites, when they report on rumors of
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.680]  upcoming iPhones inevitably, this is the report here is from nine to five Mac to say, you know,
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:38.000]  this is about the KGI report. They always illustrate the story with a user submitted
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.200]  mock-up of what a future iPhone might look like, which isn't based on, it's not like that source
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.480]  of the only way it makes sense to conclude an illustration is if you have a source who says
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:55.120]  they've seen it and then you make one that looks like what the source is saying, whereas they
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.720]  always illustrate them with these things that people just make out of their imagination. Like,
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:07.280]  it's not, it, it, it bothers me profusely because I know as a critical reader of the news, I know
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.400]  what this illustration is. I know to just ignore it, but I can't help it. I know that most people,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.560]  if they glance at this, are thinking this is an illness. This is an illustration of the thing that
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.120]  they're talking about. That's what it's going to look like. Yeah. Like, imagine if, yeah,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.400]  and I've had conversations with people, you know, like casual people, like people you meet some
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.920]  place and, you know, like, oh, I saw a picture of it the other day. I was like, that's not like,
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:35.360]  imagine if you had a news story that said, uh, uh, killer on the loose, you know, serial killer
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.240]  is on the loose in, in town and you include an illustration of a man, but the illustration of
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.960]  the man in the story has nothing to do with the killer on the loose. You just need, right. It's
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:52.800]  exactly make it's, it's somebody's ideal version killer. It's just a bald guy with a big bushy
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.560]  beard. He's got, he's got machetes for hands. Do you know what I mean? It's like whenever they
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:03.440]  used to talk about, uh, the Unabomber back before they caught him and they'd always have this story
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.000]  where there was, you know, they'd always have this illustration of a guy with a, they have a hoodie
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.880]  on, he had a hoodie and sunglasses. Yeah. Glasses. Right. But it was based on, there was a witness
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.320]  one time who saw a guy that, you know, there was some kind of connection where law enforcement
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.520]  legitimately think they thought they had a witness who saw him mailing a package one time and that
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.000]  it was a police sketch from this witness and they would use the same drawing over and over again.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.480]  It wasn't like they just randomly drew a guy, which is what these stupid illustrations of,
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:45.920]  of future edge to edge iPhones are. Anyway, I have problems with this. I don't, I don't disbelieve
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.560]  that this is Apple's plan and there is so much, there's enough smoke now that I can't help. I
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.560]  think this might be the, this might be it that they're going to do an iPhone seven S and seven S
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.040]  plus and instead of introducing them at the top of the line, they're going to introduce a new,
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.680]  they're not going to push them down the line either. They'll keep the, I think they'll keep
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:09.520]  the prices the same and instead we'll introduce a new heretofore never seen tier above this.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.440]  That's a very Apple like thing to do, like where as the rest of the industry races to lower and
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.560]  lower prices as quote unquote smartphones become more and more commodities and the average selling
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:23.600]  price of a smartphone in general continues to drop. It makes, it's a very Apple like thing to do
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.920]  to say, we're in such a position of prominence. We're so clearly the preeminent smartphone,
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.640]  you know, phone maker that we're going to move, we're going to move it up.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.360]  I could see that, but I have some problems with this plan though, because everybody also
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.880]  seems to be reporting the same things that, that this new device that the hot stuff is going to be.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.240]  They're going to have trouble making them in quantity that it's, you know,
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.080]  that it's going to be supply concern. The new iPhones have always been, yeah,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:00.240]  because the, because they can't get the screens and the touch sensors, uh, more difficult. Um,
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.600]  all of these reports have been very consistent and I don't know how many of them come from,
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.840]  you know, this one source, you know, the KGI's, um, Ming Chi Kuo. I mean, maybe he's the only
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.000]  one and it's bullshit, but they, they keep saying over again, the other thing that's reiterated is
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.480]  that they're going to, it's going to be an OLED on the front that goes edge to edge. It's going
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.640]  to have a touch sensor, you know, touch ID and a home button that is somehow embedded in the screen.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:31.040]  Um, Apple has had patents. I mean, and again, I try to stay away from patents in terms of
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.440]  the connection of, well, if Apple filed a patent, they must be using it. No,
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.600]  they file patents for anything patentable, not just anything they use, but there is a patent
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.560]  that Apple has filed somewhere where it's how to put a camera behind a display, which would
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.240]  obviously be necessary if the screen goes edge to edge because you can't get rid of the selfie
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.360]  camera. I mean, that would be like the one thing Apple could do that would actually keep people
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.160]  from buying a new phone. Like get rid of the headphone jack. Like all these tech reports,
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.400]  like, ah, you get rid of the headphone jack. Nobody's going to buy this thing. It's,
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.880]  everybody's going to wait a year to see if this, you know, takes off. No,
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.160]  it's like record breaking sales for the iPhone without the headphone jack. If they took away
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.440]  the selfie camera, people wouldn't buy it because people actually, yeah, you could,
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.480]  and you couldn't FaceTime, you couldn't, there's always, you know, apart from just being able to
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.840]  take a picture of yourself, there's other stuff. We know you love the selfie camera,
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.400]  but this edge to edge design is so beautiful. We just threw it away. Also, there's no
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:28.800]  Johnny, Johnny took away. Also, there's no speaker. So there's no earpiece for holding the phone up
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.960]  here. So you hit, I don't know, like the whole, so like, there's also speculating that it's not
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.360]  going to, it might not have buttons like on the sides either. It's like, how do you reboot that
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.280]  phone? It's got to have one, right? It has to have at least one. There's no, like at least one
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.760]  physical. There's no way to, I don't know. Uh, yeah, shake it.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.360]  The iPhone shake.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.600]  I should start writing fake rumors again. It would be funny if they made it like,
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.360]  like an old Mac where it was sort of like the little hole for the SIM card tray where you
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:21.120]  have to poke a paperclip. I weren't, that was like, like Hank, Hank found that action. So
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.160]  when I have two classic Macs up in my office and, and he doesn't play with them in a long time,
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:31.680]  but, uh, when he was younger, he'd come up and I'd fish out my old floppy disks. And I mean,
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.880]  I really think the thing that he liked, he liked, you know, like loading up some of the games and
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.680]  playing with it. But I think one of the things they liked the most was just like forcing,
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:45.440]  force ejecting a floppy disk with a, with a paperclip. And the worst part was,
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.800]  is force forcing the paperclip and was just pushing the button on the floppy drive mechanism.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.920]  Cause it wasn't like Apple had their own floppy drives. They were just buying the ones from Sony
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.520]  that everybody else used all the other PC makers. Yeah. They just, yeah, they just,
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.760]  just for the sake of elegance, they covered it up. Uh, that was brilliant though. It was brilliant
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.520]  the way that under normal operation, you didn't eject the floppy disk, the system did. And so
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.680]  you'd have to, the only way to get it out was to, uh, drag it to the trash. Although that metaphor
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.600]  dragging a disk to the trash is one of those. That was a little weird because you,
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.000]  you tell somebody that the first time, what do you think dragging a floppy disk to the trash does?
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.200]  And I, I think the right answer is somebody, the correct answer in terms of what happened is it
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.840]  would eject the disc. But I think the right answer in terms of being able to intuit how
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.840]  the, the metaphors of the Mac worked would be, well, it erases the disc, right? Nope.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.840]  They fix it. It was funny. They fixed it in Mac OS 10 by having the trash can turn into an eject
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.120]  button as you drag a disc, which is, it works because it looks like an ejector, but it's,
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.720]  it's still a little weird. Um, I, my problem with this is that I think this is the phone
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.320]  that everybody's going to want and if it's cost more and is lower quantity and they can't sell it,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.520]  who's going to buy the seven S and seven S plus I don't get it. Like who, who's going to,
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.520]  I mean, I guess that there's a lot of people who are like, well, that new phone looks awesome,
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.080]  but I'm not paying over a thousand dollars. I only want like a 32 gigabyte iPhone seven.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.400]  So I'm going to pay, you know, $600 or whatever, six 50 or whatever it costs for a 32 gig iPhone
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.640]  six or seven as that's too much. So I see that, but it's like, I don't know. It just seems,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.800]  it just seems a little weird to me that they're, that they would do both. You know why,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.840]  if they're going to come out with a new design, why not just say this is the new design,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.640]  I guess, because the price is so high. I don't know.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.040]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I guess they want to do it. They want to make it,
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:53.600]  I don't know. Um, maybe they won't do it, but, but if they want to do it,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:01.280]  uh, you know, sell it at a high price because you can't, I don't know. I'm not going to get that
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.360]  phone. I mean, the thing, the thing that bothers me about this report is there's nothing, there's
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.320]  no mention of a four inch phone. Right. Right. Right. Cause that is sort of, that's what I want
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.440]  them to do. If they have the technology to make edge to edge phones is I want them to make a phone
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:22.080]  with the screen size of the iPhone seven, the 4.7 inch diagonal, and then make the phone just
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:29.600]  that size of that screen, which would be about as tall as the iPhone, uh, S E and a little wider.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.760]  And I could take that. I could take it being a little wider, but yeah, but having it be that
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.120]  height, man, that would be great. That's the phone I want them to make. And they're not making it.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.000]  Yeah. I mean, and maybe that's the next, you know, maybe that's the next year.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.040]  I guess. I don't know. But, uh, you know, I mean, and I don't mind paying more for it.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.760]  I mean, it was, it was very nice not having to pay much for the iPhone SE, but I'm used to being,
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:56.720]  you know, basically being six 50. So, uh, I would, I would do that. I would argue. I want this. I
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.920]  want that. I just want the smaller phone with modern. I would argue right now that the most
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.080]  beloved iPhone Apple is selling today is the iPhone se that the P meaning the people who have
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:13.360]  the iPhone se know exactly why they bought it. And they're delighted by it. I know you like it. My,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:19.920]  my, my pal, my pal has one and waited, waited for it. I mean, he's not, he doesn't really follow
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.880]  this stuff religiously, but he just so did not want a bigger phone and he got the se and he loves
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.200]  it. He says it's the best thing, the best thing he's ever owned period, like gadget wise. Yeah.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.200]  Yeah. Well that's, and that's what I think like with the best Apple products I bought within
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:40.000]  at least the last year are the se and AirPods. I love it. I mean, I don't use the, I didn't buy
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.160]  an se. I sent my review unit back, but it, and it ultimately is cause I want the camera. Um,
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:51.680]  but I have mixed feelings and everybody I know who has like the iPhone seven sort of has the,
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.360]  well, I already have a bigger phone. I kind of wish I had that super fancy dual lens camera
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.280]  in the seven plus and everybody has a seven plus is like, I love this phone. I love how big it is.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.200]  I love the all day battery life, but it is kind of big, you know, like Marco was, Arman was just
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.920]  talking about an ATP where he keeps, you know, he's like 51 49 each way and every time he kind
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:14.320]  of commits to one second he goes there, the grass is greener on the other side and he wants to go
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.000]  the other way. Whereas the iPhone se people know exactly what they want. They want a phone with
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.200]  that super nice and feel pocket size. Um, you know, for the people who know that that's what
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.680]  they want is a small phone. The iPhone se is absolutely amazing. It's the best, best device,
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.720]  best iPhone Apple's ever made in some ways. Yeah. And yeah, no, I would. And in terms of,
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.240]  and I'm not surprised one bit that they spent like months trying to get it into sufficient
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.960]  quantity to meet demand that this phone with your old internal technologies was actually
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.640]  so popular that they couldn't keep up with demand. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't. Yeah. So I didn't,
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.640]  I don't know what, if this is what's coming out in the fall, I'm not, I'm not sure what I would,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.840]  what I'm going to do because I don't, I don't want a bigger phone. And so, and I don't want to spend,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.880]  I mean, I'm certainly not going to spend a thousand dollars to get a gigantic phone
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.680]  and I don't want to either the other two. So I'm going to stick with my se.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.320]  The consensus on, like I said, like the phone, the ideal phone that I wish Apple would make was
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:18.400]  with 4.7 inch display, this display from the iPhone seven with no chin or forehead. And if
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:23.120]  they can narrow the sides a little bit, that'd be great. And that would be a phone that physically
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:30.400]  would be about as tall as the se and a little wider. And I could take that everybody that the
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:36.480]  consensus, if you just draw a 16, you know, just take a piece of graph paper and make a 16 to nine
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:43.360]  aspect ratio rectangle with a 5.8 inch diagonal, which is the size of this OLED display everybody's
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:51.200]  talking about. Um, that's roughly as tall as the iPhone seven. So you're not carrying around a plus
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.840]  sized phone in height anymore. You've got like the, the smaller current iPhone,
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.600]  you know, the mid-sized iPhone in height, but it's a lot wider. It is a very wide phone. It's just,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.000]  it, it there's, you know, just take a piece of graph, you know, here's your homework listeners,
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.280]  you know, take a piece of graph paper and draw it. I don't want a phone that's any bigger than
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.040]  this phone is the biggest phone that I could possibly be happy carrying. So I don't want a
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.400]  phone that's the same height as this, but wider. I'm not saying I won't buy it, but I'm going to
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.520]  bitch about it every, every single week on this, on this show. Uh, here, let me take a final break
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:34.000]  here and do our third and final sponsor of the week. It is our good friends at Casper. Casper
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.840]  sells obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices. Go to casper.com slash
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.920]  the talk show and use that code, the talk show, and you will save 50 bucks
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.880]  towards your mattress. Put an asterisk right there. Asterisk. That means I'm going to have
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.000]  a footnote at the end. So listen, I'll tell you what that footnote is at the end. Now,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.240]  here's the deal. Casper created one perfect mattress. They have a team of engineers,
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.840]  mattress engineers, and instead of selling like six different types with different foam
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.840]  and different Springs and different tech, you know, whatever, no, they just made one
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.920]  good mattress. So you don't have to decide who wants to decide, let the mattress engineers
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.320]  decide. Like you buy a mattress once every 10 years or something like that. You don't
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.640]  know anything about buying a mattress who does, but mattress engineers do. So they just made one.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.000]  This is a very Apple like way of doing things. Like you don't have to decide what your Mac
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.240]  books are made out of. Guess what? It's made out of aluminum and you're going to like it.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.320]  Uh, you just pick the size. That's it. And because they make their own mattresses,
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:36.400]  uh, they can sell them to you direct and the prices are way lower, unbelievably lower than
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.760]  the prices you pay in a traditional Matt retail mattress deal. Uh, they also make their own
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:49.040]  pillows. It's an adaptive pillow with soft and, uh, uh, soft, breathable, breathable material.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:55.760]  And they make their own sheets so you can get all your bedding. Uh, all of this stuff is super high
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.880]  quality, premium quality, deluxe, just deluxe mattresses. Unbelievably good sheets. Great
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.760]  pillow. I have one of their pillows really great. Uh, and it's all completely risk-free. You say,
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.760]  I don't want to spend, you know, a thousand dollars on a King size mattress and I'd never
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.320]  even tried it. You just try it. They ship it to you. It comes in a little box, at least a little
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.160]  compared to a King size mattress or queen or whatever you want. You open it up in your bedroom.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:24.640]  It sucks up all the oxygen. So be careful because you could get hurt. You could asphyxiate like open
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.680]  it and kind of like, Oh, make sure a window is open and it fills with air early on. Yeah. Early
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:36.240]  on some engineers at Casper. Uh, you open it up and then you get a hundred night home trial sleep
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.760]  on it for three months. And if you're not happy, I swear to you, they will no questions asked,
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.160]  no hassle. This is not like returning your, you know, canceling your cable subscription
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.080]  where you know, you have to like threaten them. No, they'll just say, okay. Okay. And then they'll
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.840]  say, when's a good time to pick it up and they'll schedule a guy to come and pick it up and they'll
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.720]  take it away and you get all your money back. So go to casper.com slash the talk show. Remember
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.000]  that code that you talk show, you'll save 50 bucks towards your mattress. Next time you need a
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.720]  mattress, go to Casper. I swear it is great. Um, I've got my whole family hooked on these things.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.560]  Uh, here's the asterisk. They also sell a dog mattress. That's the dog mattress. I was gonna
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.160]  say when you get the dog, you can get one for the dog. The code doesn't work on the dog mattress
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.920]  because the mattress, the dog mattress is cheap enough that they won't give you 50 bucks off,
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.920]  but your dog will thank you. So that's the asterisk. You can't get that. You can't save
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.440]  the money on that. Oh, anything else? Anything else you wanted to talk about? I had a couple
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.880]  of things in the show notes. You see Samsung's Samsung had a factory catch fire because of
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:42.160]  batteries. Just why? Because of batteries they threw out. They threw out a bunch of bum batteries
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:48.320]  and they caught on fire. I got a, I got a note from, I'm not going to say who, but I got a note
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.840]  from somebody else in the media. It doesn't, it's sort of like not, sort of not an enemy of mine,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.520]  but someone who likes to give me shit. And, and he wrote that he, he was like, I don't often have
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:05.520]  good things to say about you, but slow clap for this one, which was my link to this where like
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.040]  I wrote the headline was Samsung factory fire triggered by discarded batteries. And my entire
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.560]  contents of the article was the rare case when a figurative garbage fire turns into a literal
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:22.320]  garbage fire. Now that's good. I call this show that the show notes, this description of the
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.720]  talk show says that it's the director's commentary for daring fireball, which is sort of happened.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.360]  I sometimes look at that and think it's not quite right, but to do like a real director's commentary,
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.480]  I will reveal my thinking behind this post where I knew I wanted to link to it.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.680]  I, I, the joke came to me immediately, but I didn't know which way to do it. Put the straight
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:47.760]  news in the headline and make the joke in the body. Or should I, should I use the headline
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.520]  figurative garbage fire turns into literal garbage fire and then have the body say Samsung factory
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:04.240]  fire triggered by discarded batteries. I couldn't decide which way to go. I kind of regret it.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.360]  That's why I'm sort of talking about it now where I kind of feel like maybe it was a little more
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.800]  likely to go viral as a retweeted tweet. If, cause the thing that goes in the tweet is the headline.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:22.480]  Yes. Yeah. And it, and it comes off more as a, a, uh, uh, an onion ask thing, except it's real.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.760]  Only I had that thought that was one of the jokes I read through my head too.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.440]  There's just a right. And I try to avoid it because usually if, if the joke that comes to
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.360]  me is not from the onion, there's a better joke somewhere because you could say it about a lot
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.680]  of things, but it really does. It really does read like an onion article. Like one of the ones that
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.760]  doesn't even have the article where they just have headlines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, anything
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:56.320]  else that you wanted to talk about this week? Uh, I, I don't know. Your, your, um, your site
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.920]  is, is very political. It is, it is. I don't know what you don't know. I don't know if you do that
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.880]  on the show. You know, I mean, I noticed that I've noticed you've gotten some pushback from
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.920]  some readers, uh, a little bit, but since this is the direct, I will say this, uh, that I have,
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:17.280]  I I've actually in the recent years largely tuned out of obsessively watching the stats
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.600]  during fireball. Um, it roughly, uh, it's not secret though. I'm not, I'm not secretive about
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:28.160]  it. A couple of years ago, it peaked out at around 4 million page views per month
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:37.120]  and it collapsed when, when Google reader went away. I, it, I lost around a million page views
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:42.400]  a month when Google reader went away and seemingly there were so many people using Google reader who
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:47.760]  when a new during fireball articles would come up, they would go, you know, like, you know,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:52.240]  open a new tab from Google reader to read it on during fireball. This isn't counting people who
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.040]  just read the RSS. This is people who come to the site. Google reader had a tremendous impact on
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.120]  the page views, but I don't think it had any impact on the number of people who read during
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.680]  fireball. This is why I didn't have never sold my sponsorships based on promises of page views.
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:11.440]  It's, you know, the, uh, just a loose estimate of how many people read the site, whether they
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.840]  come once a day or whether they come three times a day. It's readers that matter more than pages.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.160]  Um, and slowly but surely, and lots of other people have noticed this too. Page views are down.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.960]  Um, but they've stabilized at like, uh, somewhere between 2.5, around 2.5 million pages per month.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.960]  And that's super stable. That's been like, like for the last 18 months, September is the only
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.040]  exception where September it goes up a little bit because that's when the iPhone news comes out and
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.280]  I tend to be writing a little more and people are a little more interested. But other than September,
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.520]  it's pretty stable month to month. Um, uh, there's been no drop off since I've started writing more
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.120]  about politics. So all the people who've said, uh, you're gonna, you know, you're gonna lose,
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.520]  you know, I come to you to get away from this, you're gonna lose readers. I haven't lost any
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.000]  readers or if I F well, you, and you've always talked about it at least a little bit now and
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.840]  again. So it's not, it shouldn't, your views shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. I would not,
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.480]  I would not, I didn't do this during the George W. Bush era. Uh, I would not have done it if John
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:18.400]  McCain had beaten, uh, Obama with one exception, which I will come back to in a second. And I
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.880]  almost certainly would not have done it if Mitt Romney had beaten Obama four years ago with Paul
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:29.520]  Ryan. The exception is, and I did write about it then in 2008 was I was vociferously opposed to
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:34.880]  Sarah Palin as the vice presidential nominee on the grounds that she was completely utterly,
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:41.760]  literally no politics involved, just unqualified and unfit for the job as vice president. Like the,
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.400]  like the president. We exactly like, except I would, would you trade Trump for Sarah Palin?
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:55.440]  Oh God, that's a close call. Maybe I would. I think I would be, I think I would be. That's a
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.240]  really, I think I would, because I think she's completely unqualified and I don't think she's
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:07.440]  a real reality. I don't think she's big on facts. Um, but I don't think she's on the other hand,
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.880]  I don't think, which I think are things that you really need. I think it's absolutely essential.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.200]  I think this idea that you could be unhinged from reality. I know people say like unhinged
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.400]  from reality. It's a cliche, but I think that's literally what Donald Trump is. I think he's
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:25.440]  completely unhinged from reality. Uh, I, he's also, I think he's more vindictive. I completely
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:32.240]  agree with that. I completely agree that he's more vindictive. Um, I just, she can be a little,
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.960]  she can be a little vindictive, but he's like, he's turned it into an art form. I would take,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.800]  it's a closer call. I mean, there's no doubt in my mind. I mean, I would take, I would take Mike
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.280]  Pence. I'm hoping that, that, that, that Trump gets impeached. I'm hoping that there's some kind
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.720]  of plan in place in the Republican party and that, yeah, I mean, he, he is my Pence is reprehensible
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:59.040]  as a, as a, I would think both a person and a politician. Um, but, uh, I think he's,
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.640]  he's much more stable. Uh, yeah, I don't think he, I don't think he, there's no doubt in my
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:11.840]  mind that he would not start a war on a lark. Uh, I really, I mean, I, yeah, I mean, some of the,
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.680]  some of these comments that he's made, you know, he's very, he's very interested in making, um,
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:23.760]  like tiny nukes. Um, because he's, he seems like, he seems like sometime within the next four years,
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.960]  he wants to drop the nuclear bomb. Right. So he's made the argument of why do we,
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.960]  why do we have them? And we're not going to use them, which is terrifying. Yeah.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:38.720]  Uh, the truth is we don't have, we, we have them because we invented them and it, you know,
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.400]  somebody else was going to invent them first and it was strategically better for us to have
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.120]  invented them. But really the whole point of having them now is to keep any, hopefully keep
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:53.360]  anybody else on the planet from using them, which is from using it's deterrence. Well,
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.720]  he doesn't, you know, guy doesn't know what the start treaty is. Well, and the other thing is
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:05.520]  that the whole theory of nuclear deterrence is based on a chess like series of strategic.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:11.360]  If we do this, they might do, here's what they might do in response. And at any step of the way,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.600]  there's this logical aspect of, okay, so it really makes the most sense for nobody to use them first.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.760]  And it's the fact that there's like three or four logical steps involved to completely
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.880]  prevent this man from, from using it. I it's really, to me, it's, it is politics in terms
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.080]  of it's commenting on politicians, but it's not, I, I'm still trying my best to avoid any sort of
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:39.280]  left right divide. And the only aspect of it that doesn't involve Trump that I'm willing to write
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.240]  about is the stuff that I would consider out and out corruption, which to me shouldn't be a left
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.600]  right thing, but unfortunately has become one like this thing yesterday where I linked to the story
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.240]  about Trump's new FCC guy, which is sort of more along the lines of traditional during fireball
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.200]  content, talking about the FCC and the stuff that they can regulate. But that one of the things that
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:06.000]  regulations that he's, he's targeted to get rid of is a thing to, to open up cable boxes to,
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.280]  you know, have laws in place to open up the cable box market. Well, that's not a liberal idea.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.920]  You know, that, that, that's just anybody who's ever been frustrated with the shitty,
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.600]  you don't have any options. Here's Comcast gives you this box and you get it and that's it.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.760]  And it sucks. And you have to pay them a hundred dollars a month to use it or whatever they charge.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:31.520]  That's not a politics. That's not a politics thing. There's not a single regular person in
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.680]  the entire country of 300 million people who wouldn't be better off if, if, if that was the
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.640]  law of the land. And instead the only people who it works for people who, you know, who own cable
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.880]  companies. Right. Right. So that's just out and out corruption in my mind.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.760]  Or this other one that really gets me as this thing yesterday, I linked to where, uh,
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:57.360]  this Georgia Republican named Purdue is introduced resolution to, to, to throw out a new package of
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:04.640]  rules for, for prepaid debit card, uh, uh, overdraft fees. And this is the thing that
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.360]  affects low-income people. Low-income people can't get a credit card. They go,
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.800]  and if they have the cash, you can get a prepaid debit card. And now you have a debit card
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:15.760]  that's prepaid and you can use it in places where you need a credit card. I mean, this is a thing
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.960]  that can really help people get back on their feet. Cause there's, you know, it's really hard
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:22.800]  to function in our society without a credit card or something that works like a credit card that
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:30.720]  you can swipe. Uh, and the idea that they would charge these completely you serious overdraft
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.720]  fees that the over and this company that is doing it in a favor of runs, uh, the payday,
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:41.760]  what I call payday loan places, which are notoriously bad and need regulation because
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:47.760]  they charge the type of the type of interest rates that the Bible like tells you, you know,
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:52.480]  that this is wrong, you know, like re it's why the, it's why the mob isn't that big anymore
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.000]  because they just, they all want to write business. I mean, they don't have to, they don't
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.920]  have to charge rates that are worse than what the mob ever charged people. Like when you go to a
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:04.640]  loan shark, it really, you know, uh, but the overdraft fees on these debit cards are actually
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:12.160]  higher than the payday loan interest rates. It's, it, it, it's absolutely the sort of thing that
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.160]  the government should be doing. It is not a liberal idea. It's not a democratic idea,
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.920]  a Republican idea. It is exactly what the government, the idea of government is meant
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:24.880]  to do. It's just, it's created rules for society that help the population at large. There's nobody,
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.880]  nobody who gets hurt or is offended, uh, the political and in terms of the political
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.400]  sensibilities, when the intro, when the penalty fee for overdraw, drawing your prepaid debit card
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:43.280]  is a reasonable low level, it's absolutely absurd. And it's, of course it turns out that they spent
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:50.640]  270, the company spent $270,000 lobbying Congress, including this shit bag from, from Georgia,
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.000]  David Purdue, but we don't talk politics. And there's that, I mean, there's that thing that
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.920]  the North North Dakota, uh, legislature did. The, the, there was a, Oh, an initiative ballot
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:09.120]  initiative that would enforce, um, you know, not enforced just on Republicans, but enforce ethics
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:16.560]  rules on any elected official. And they convened an emergency session of the legislature to
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:26.720]  overthrow a voter approved ballot initiative for, uh, ethics requirements. Right. It was literally
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.440]  just a ballot direct democracy, not a representative democracy. It is. Yeah.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.200]  And, and, and, you know, admittedly, you know, we have, we have a lot of ballot initiatives out
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:44.160]  here and a lot of them are, are bad shit, insane and shitty. Um, and people don't always know what
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:50.000]  they're doing when they vote for some of these things. However, uh, in many cases, it's, it's
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.880]  a way to, to tell the legislature, Hey, you know what, screw you, you're not doing what we want you
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:04.000]  to do. Uh, and now you're going to, well, I guess not, you know, unless you can crave an emergency
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:11.360]  of convening an emergency session to, to undo it before it can take place is astounding,
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.880]  especially on something where it's just ethics and government. It really isn't controversial.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:19.760]  You know what I mean? Like you're going to argue that Brexit never should have been a ballot
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.760]  initiative that it's right. Oh yeah. That's exactly the sort of thing that, that that's why
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.960]  representative government is better than direct democracy. You know, it is a West coasting ballot
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.200]  initiatives. We have them here, but they're all municipal. It's all Philly. There, there aren't,
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:38.160]  I don't even think they're statewide. I don't think I've ever even seen a statewide ballot
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.320]  initiative. I don't think Pennsylvania has them. Philadelphia, the city does. Well,
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.880]  that's why you can't buy beer. Otherwise that would have gotten overturned a long time ago.
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:53.280]  Have I ever, no, it's actually funny. There actually is not popular appeal in Pennsylvania
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.840]  for this. I don't know. I know you're running short on time here, but yeah, but the gist of
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.960]  it is Pennsylvania. When, when prohibition was repealed before prohibition, Pennsylvania,
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:09.040]  Philadelphia had the highest per capita number of bars in the country. There was something like a
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:16.080]  bar for every 40 men, something like that. And Philadelphia was a fantastically wet town during
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:20.640]  prohibition. None of the bars closed. They all just claimed to close, just stayed open and the
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:26.880]  police never enforced it. But Pennsylvania had a pro prohibition governor at the time. I forget the
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:33.520]  idiot's name, but when prohibition was repealed, uh, he created what was called and still is to
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.400]  this day called the Pennsylvania liquor control board. And he publicly said this was because he
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.160]  was pro prohibition. He was against the repeal of it, even though it had been repealed, but he was
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.920]  still pounding the, you know, sort of like, uh, where, where you can still today be, uh, uh,
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.680]  abortion should be legal, illegal politician, even though it's been the law of the land for
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:58.400]  44 years, you know, it politically, it seemingly wasn't political death to be pro prohibition.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.400]  He created the Pennsylvania liquor control board with the stated per stated purpose of making it
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:07.600]  as difficult as possible to get it alcohol in Pennsylvania as, as, as he could. And that was
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.960]  where that's where all, all liquor comes from. And we've got these crazy laws where they're starting
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.720]  to get softened up a little bit. Like supermarkets are starting to get special licenses where they
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:23.040]  can sell beer. Um, but you can't buy beer in a supermarket. You can only buy cases of beer from
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:27.120]  a quote unquote beer distributor and a beer distributor can't sell beer in anything less
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:32.400]  than a case. Uh, so you can go and buy a six pack, but at this place where you buy a six pack,
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:36.560]  you can't buy more than 12 beers at once. Uh, it has to be in two separate six packs. If you
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.920]  go to buy a case of beer, you can do that. You can buy wine and spirits in the state controlled
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.760]  liquor stores and only through the state controlled liquor stores. And anyway, we had a
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.560]  Republican governor a couple of years ago named Corbett who wanted to abolish the Pennsylvania
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.120]  liquor control board and just make Pennsylvania a normal state where you could, you know,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:02.400]  like the places where you buy beer and wine are just independent businesses and it didn't have
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.320]  popular support because the way that the opposition, the way they defeated it was the,
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:16.400]  the liquor liquor store employees are all, it's a union job and the union, the union ran ads
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.400]  saying, you know, we have, I think there's, I don't know, 6,000 people employed by the liquor
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.200]  stores. This guy's going to cost us 6,000 jobs. Now this is in a state with, I don't know,
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.520]  I forget it, but the population of Pennsylvania is, but it's like 20 million or something.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.160]  I don't know, but 15, 10 million, 10, 20 million people, 6,000 jobs are going to be lost without,
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.800]  you know, addressing the fact that every single person who gets hired by, by the new liquor
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.560]  stores that would open up would have a job that didn't exist. And that just gets it, but, but
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.000]  just, he's going to, you know, getting away with this, getting away with the state stores would
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.720]  eliminate 6,000 jobs was enough to kill it politically, which is crazy, absolutely crazy.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:00.560]  So we are here. We, we now get beer, wine and liquor and really at the grocery store.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.120]  Yeah, I wish. I can't buy any of it. So if you want to, I always say my analogy is if you want
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:16.080]  to buy, if you want to buy like your ingredients to cook dinner, a bottle of wine and a six pack of
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.320]  beer in Pennsylvania, there's no possible way that you're not going to three stores. You have to go
