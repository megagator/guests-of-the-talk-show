[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Tough fact to follow
[00:02.720 --> 00:05.920]  A little bit and I'd like to thank Phil for warming up the crowd for me
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.320]  Also a very different vibe. It's
[00:11.120 --> 00:17.920]  The live show atmosphere is so great and that it when it worked and it I think it worked pretty well last week
[00:17.920 --> 00:21.160]  It's pretty good feeling. I can't even imagine doing that every week though
[00:22.400 --> 00:24.400]  No, it's a different show
[00:24.400 --> 00:26.400]  It's yeah, it's great, but I mean
[00:26.400 --> 00:32.160]  I know you get nervous before a big interview, but you know, I'm not going to be that hard to just you know, I'll go with you
[00:33.680 --> 00:35.680]  Phil was pretty good though
[00:36.240 --> 00:39.280]  He's great. Yeah, you know what he was way more candid than I thought it was gonna be
[00:39.840 --> 00:42.400]  I don't think he would have done it otherwise, you know
[00:42.400 --> 00:47.920]  I mean like and I feel like that is that's the like I think that's the thing that people were most surprised by the other thing that
[00:47.920 --> 00:54.400]  I think people were surprised by was how clear it was that he reads our stuff, you know like his familiarity with Marcos
[00:54.400 --> 01:00.560]  Complaints and a couple of other things too, but it a couple people like the the the most common comments
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.080]  I got afterwards were
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.160]  Wow, that's a side of Phil Schiller. I've never seen before. He was very, you know
[01:06.160 --> 01:11.520]  He just was casual and combined with wow, he obviously you know pays attention to us
[01:12.880 --> 01:16.880]  Yeah, well most too. I mean we've known for years that he's been meeting most of the stuff, but
[01:17.680 --> 01:19.680]  It was nice to give a shout out to
[01:19.680 --> 01:26.080]  To your you know to your beloved guests. It was very good. It was a fun time at the show too
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  Yeah, it was great. It was bad
[01:30.560 --> 01:34.720]  But you know what good job. I know I told you in person, but I'm sure if anybody listening to this is thinking it
[01:35.920 --> 01:38.240]  You did not screw up, so get on here
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.480]  And you nailed him quite a bit not nailed him, but you know what I mean like you held this feet to the fun
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.040]  Yeah, a little bit without being a jerk. That was the dance, you know is how do I ask the you know
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.120]  Questions that everybody in the room kind of wants me to ask and there's other ones that I missed too
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.000]  I mean we could and I had to it's like I had to decide what not to ask because you know an hour is
[01:59.200 --> 02:02.720]  A it was a little bit longer than I think that I'd told them that he'd be on stage
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.720]  I'd said like maybe like 45 50 minutes
[02:04.720 --> 02:06.720]  I think he was on stage for like
[02:06.720 --> 02:09.920]  56 minutes or something like that which was not a complaint. He thought it went well
[02:09.920 --> 02:11.920]  It was all smiles all around backstage
[02:12.080 --> 02:17.120]  But the other thing too is I feel like just the atmosphere of a live room. You can't do it like we do on these
[02:17.120 --> 02:19.120]  You know Skype
[02:19.120 --> 02:22.080]  Shows you can't go more than than 60 minutes
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.920]  Yeah, there's something more Skype. They just let you go off into the weeds and
[02:26.880 --> 02:30.400]  Whatever like take a break get your senses and just not make sense
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.400]  No, it's very direct right like we could have gone in like one that one thing like people have sent like or I wish
[02:36.480 --> 02:37.120]  I all you know
[02:37.440 --> 02:38.240]  That was a great interview
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.640]  But I wish you would have you know talked about blank and the one that's very common is the app store
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.760]  It um, but I do one of the reasons I didn't is there was nothing really new about it
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.000]  And I kind of wanted to focus a little bit more on
[02:50.480 --> 02:54.480]  You know current events and the other thing too is I feel like once you open that can of worms
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.200]  That's a root you know, that's hard to do in just a couple minutes
[02:59.280 --> 03:01.280]  It's a very complicated
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.000]  Thing I mean, but both the app store distribution models
[03:05.120 --> 03:08.720]  What adapting existing business models to work on the app store
[03:09.520 --> 03:11.520]  provisioning
[03:11.520 --> 03:15.920]  Like the code signing nightmares. Oh, yeah, and a big one too especially and I don't know
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.120]  I actually don't know
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.160]  I suspect that my audience and the audience that was in the you know in the room for the live show
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.200]  Is skewed a little bit more towards Mac developers than the overall
[03:27.920 --> 03:30.080]  Apple developer community in general
[03:30.400 --> 03:36.000]  But it certainly of interest to me is the whole sandboxing situation with the Mac and
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.600]  I kind of we can kind of get into that was you and I talk about some of the stuff today. I kind of wonder whether the
[03:42.240 --> 03:44.240]  What are they calling this rootless thing
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.560]  System integrity, right? I kind of hope that that might be a way of backing away from sandboxing
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.920]  Could be could be look at there
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.080]  But I do think that I mean you only had an hour. Well, you had less on paper
[03:59.040 --> 04:04.160]  I agree that Mac app store would or even any app store would have been a kind of worms and
[04:04.160 --> 04:09.280]  Frankly, he just couldn't answer anything. Yeah, I that's part of it like I know
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.040]  I mean I know he's the boss of the app stores, but I mean he's not going to make
[04:13.760 --> 04:15.760]  promises on stage to you
[04:16.160 --> 04:18.160]  Like that that's you know
[04:18.800 --> 04:22.080]  As forthcoming as he was with other stuff. He didn't say anything that was
[04:24.080 --> 04:30.800]  Counter to you know, he's very very good. It's job. Yeah, you didn't say anything that was counted to the messaging about one thing the people asked
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.960]  Over throughout the week and so, you know, I love it. I do love WWDC and it's it is weird and different like I went to the
[04:38.160 --> 04:41.440]  The beer bash go to the beer bash this year, but you probably didn't
[04:42.160 --> 04:47.280]  But I went and Dowrymple was there and I always go one of the and I'm always on the fences to whether to go
[04:47.280 --> 04:52.160]  Amy was with me out there all week as you know, and I always feel a little bad going to the beer bash because
[04:53.760 --> 04:55.360]  Actually, I
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.400]  Because you end up leaving and I knew you weren't there because that's who I left her with I
[05:00.960 --> 05:03.680]  Loved her with you now that I think about it, but I go
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.280]  Because it used to be in years past that was the place where I would run into some people from Apple that I know
[05:09.440 --> 05:16.480]  Who I hadn't seen throughout the week if you want to bump into somebody from Apple and whether he we end up talking about anything
[05:16.480 --> 05:19.680]  Interesting or not even if it's you know, just shooting the shit
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  It's a good place to run into them
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.440]  And it's funny. That's what I thought about. That's why I went and it turned out that it was really sort of the opposite
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.440]  It was people coming up to me who wanted to you know say hi and thank me and et cetera, et cetera
[05:32.880 --> 05:38.400]  So you big shot. That's what you tell us. No, not really and I think the reason that it really it was it was
[05:40.160 --> 05:42.160]  It was so
[05:42.160 --> 05:45.280]  Like one person after the other is that I was walking around with Dowrymple
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.360]  What's in these these cuts are rather distinctive figure?
[05:49.360 --> 05:56.800]  A little bit a little bit less less of one. Yeah, definitely. He looks great. There's lots of weight and he looks bad
[05:57.360 --> 05:59.360]  Looks looks younger
[05:59.360 --> 06:02.080]  I mean, yeah, exactly. I mean, he always looked formidable
[06:02.960 --> 06:05.120]  Now it just looks like he definitely mess you up
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.920]  And somehow I swear to God. It's like he you know, but you want to talk about who's influential
[06:09.920 --> 06:12.880]  They only had three beers available at the beer bash and one of them was Heineken
[06:12.880 --> 06:20.560]  I was like today. I was like today ask you or did they just do it in advance? You know, they're no better
[06:23.600 --> 06:27.200]  So went to his beard bash right party and that I
[06:27.920 --> 06:33.280]  Order to Stella not as yeah, it was Stella. I didn't want to touch the Heineken just yeah, your words
[06:33.280 --> 06:36.560]  It's gonna I didn't well, I didn't know which way we're great right like either
[06:36.880 --> 06:41.760]  I'm drinking his beer and he's gonna be pissed or I'm not drinking a Heineken and he's gonna be pissed. That's so
[06:41.760 --> 06:44.960]  Yeah, you had of all the bones every now and then you know
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.200]  um
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.480]  Anyway, we ought to get to it because we have a lot to cover and the whole idea the basic idea that I have for this episode is
[06:53.200 --> 06:55.840]  To cover more or less
[06:56.080 --> 07:02.800]  Loosely the state of the union stuff platforms. What do they call that session platform platform state of the year platform state of the union?
[07:02.800 --> 07:08.400]  Yeah, they used to break it up until like three I think right which is you know the basic structure of Monday at
[07:08.400 --> 07:13.760]  WWDC is sort of remained unchanged since forever, which is in the morning
[07:13.840 --> 07:20.400]  There's the main keynote and that's the one that the press gets led into and that's the one people line up all night for
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.800]  Um, that's the one that anything that's written, you know on my real TV or newspapers the next day
[07:26.800 --> 07:33.120]  All the news from there is what what comes out of it. Then they clear the room people go and have lunch and
[07:33.120 --> 07:38.320]  I think around 230 is when it starts. It's it's a bit later
[07:38.320 --> 07:42.720]  You have like a good two hours for lunch to everybody, but then at that point. It's
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.520]  Real developer badges only you get to come in and then they have it's more or less a second keynote, but it's truly for developers
[07:52.560 --> 07:56.800]  I mean like I was saying, you know, she was very good at its job
[07:56.800 --> 08:04.320]  And I believe he constrained all of his other answers to what was actually in the keynote rather than the rest of the stuff
[08:04.320 --> 08:07.440]  And they've been getting a little bit loosey to see what the NBA stuff so I'm not really
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.280]  Yeah, I don't think that that's I don't even think that that's I don't think there is stuff
[08:11.280 --> 08:14.160]  I don't think there is an NDA because my Apple TV
[08:15.200 --> 08:18.000]  There's a WWDC app and you can just I don't think I put my
[08:18.880 --> 08:21.680]  ADC so yeah, I've been watching that too
[08:21.680 --> 08:23.840]  And I wasn't sure because the the login that I've got
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.240]  Has an Apple ID account like I wasn't sure if maybe it was cleared for
[08:29.040 --> 08:33.840]  Yeah, and they've been doing some stuff to combine the Apple IDs, but it's not the same Apple idea
[08:33.840 --> 08:37.040]  I usually sign in for ADC stuff. I'm pretty sure that that stuff is just non
[08:37.040 --> 08:42.000]  They don't they don't really have an NDA anymore. I think they well, I think they you know what I'm
[08:42.880 --> 08:46.480]  Let's gamble my career, but it's not like I'm keeping my head down
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.760]  I'm pretty sure that the stuff is I just don't think that they're crazy about stuff like that anymore
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.840]  I don't know and it shouldn't be because I mean
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.560]  the
[08:56.560 --> 08:58.560]  Pretty much everything they say is
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.360]  What you don't want to do is say what people say to you in private or in the labs or something right
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.560]  Because that's like oh, yeah, this is broken. Here's a workaround and
[09:09.280 --> 09:13.360]  You know we can't talk about the future stuff that it gets a little bit more on the negative side
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.160]  But in a lot of ways WWDC especially because they sell out every year
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.360]  I don't want to call it but it's not an marketing or advertising thing, but it's
[09:24.640 --> 09:26.640]  it's one of the very few times it's
[09:27.520 --> 09:33.680]  A year of not the only time a year that Apple actually gets to speak to developers and in a way limiting that
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.640]  is kind of productive
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.520]  Because it's not like Google doesn't know what the hell was said in every 80 like WWDC session
[09:42.520 --> 09:45.920]  Yeah, I think it's actually I think it's sort of this shift towards a
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.960]  A more open Apple PR department and I'm not going to pin it all on Katie Cotton
[09:50.960 --> 09:57.120]  But it you know it ties in with her leaving. I mean it started before well, you know
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.480]  Year or two ago. I think when they lightened up on the
[10:00.960 --> 10:06.880]  NDA a little bit and she was still there. Yeah, but it's definitely the shift that they're making and I think it was always about
[10:07.520 --> 10:08.560]  PR optics
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.960]  It was that they don't want people saying
[10:10.960 --> 10:17.200]  Anything in public about the beta version of OS they've shown until they've released the OS
[10:17.840 --> 10:24.600]  But now, you know, they've even you know, there was there was obviously like an embargo on Monday morning where they ceded a bunch of people from the press with
[10:25.680 --> 10:29.440]  Yeah, that's a lot. You know the current developer beta of
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.400]  OS 10
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.240]  El Capitan
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.080]  And let them write about it. I mean and it's you know, I think they emphasize them all in fact
[10:38.080 --> 10:40.960]  I know because they gave me the same copy to I
[10:42.960 --> 10:48.480]  Didn't write anything. I didn't know to I told them I was like there isn't absolutely zero percent chance that I'm going to be ready to write
[10:48.480 --> 10:51.040]  I didn't publish anything by Monday, but they're like well take it anyway
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.600]  But I think they wanted you know, they wanted the people to know that just emphasize that this is a preview
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.840]  It's a beta this you know, you're reviewing the ideas of what we're doing not the current state that they're in
[11:01.840 --> 11:07.840]  And I just think in the past they just wanted the opposite. They did not want anybody writing about them
[11:08.800 --> 11:10.800]  Well, I think they're slowly gluing into
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.680]  Like a comfort zone that they did not have in back in like the late 90's right like they were really on their heels for a while
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.880]  So, you know, you can understand that backs of the world being defensive kind of thing
[11:25.840 --> 11:26.960]  But you know
[11:26.960 --> 11:32.480]  It's a different yeah, and I think you know, and I you know, I think Steve Jobs too was also a lot less
[11:32.800 --> 11:38.560]  Bailing to have people writing about stuff before it came out and you know and the whole idea that stuff can change
[11:39.280 --> 11:40.320]  You know, he won
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.800]  You know, I just to feel like if something changes something that they announced last week ends up not shipping in the fall
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.520]  You know people are gonna call it out, but I don't think that he's gonna
[11:51.520 --> 11:54.560]  You know, I think he was more crazy about stuff. I doubt that Apple is now
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.960]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's made clear and I'd becoming Steve Jobs
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.640]  Yeah, which please everybody read rather than the Isaacson biography
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.560]  Well, we'd both right. They're both worth reading, but if you're only gonna read one reading that one first
[12:09.360 --> 12:11.360]  Yeah, because I mean he's
[12:11.360 --> 12:15.760]  Even at these guys I'm gonna blank on his name, but the author of two whose
[12:16.400 --> 12:18.400]  Experiences it's
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.800]  Two of them, but they'd they'd perhaps like let's let's I forget. I pronounce this lesson. Sure. So now anyway
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.560]  I'm home. I'm sorry. He's not shown us. Yeah
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.600]  There's there's part of that story where he basically just Steve Jobs calls him up and
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.720]  Just yells at him for saying that stuff about Apple and but their friends like their kids hang out together and all that so
[12:43.680 --> 12:45.680]  Brent Slender
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.280]  Slender, okay
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.160]  But so yeah, I think a lot of that came from Steve and even if you were a pal that I don't think he'd be
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.560]  Shut it. Yeah, yeah, but so yeah times of changing Apple is
[12:57.600 --> 12:59.920]  The hugest of companies at this point, so
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.360]  You know, you never want to be punching down, right? So I think I think there's more open attitude
[13:08.400 --> 13:10.640]  benefits
[13:10.640 --> 13:24.240]  But anyway, I who better to have on and I want to talk about some of this developer level news and try to put it in
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.440]  Which is a lot more preparation than I usually do for the show and just looking at it. It's like man
[13:29.840 --> 13:31.840]  Well, I did have a tough act to follow
[13:33.040 --> 13:38.960]  There really is though I know the other takeaway I had from and watching the state of the Union
[13:38.960 --> 13:47.120]  It is that I I feel like Apple is really starting to get better at being a big company and
[13:48.320 --> 13:56.480]  It's and clearly a lot of this stuff has been delegated and it's a lot less is going through one person even like someone like
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.480]  Craig Federigh who obviously is in charge of the engineering teams in charge of
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.040]  both OS 10 and
[14:05.040 --> 14:10.560]  iOS clearly the man has a lot of responsibilities, but there's a lot of stuff that's being delegated
[14:10.560 --> 14:15.680]  I think clearly because it's more stuff is being done year over year than before
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.760]  Seems that way certainly appears that way from the on stage presence
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.320]  That could have been a conscious decision to kind of bring more people on stage
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.440]  I mean, you'd probably know this more than I remember, but it seemed to me that there was like a cast of five people that
[14:33.440 --> 14:41.920]  ran Apple for like 10 years there between 2001 to like let's say 2012 they had like maybe five people on stage
[14:42.400 --> 14:47.840]  With a couple of and you're talking about the regular keynote or the stadium. Yeah, they make you or the basically keynote
[14:47.840 --> 14:50.160]  Yeah, not the state of the Union State of the Union was much better
[14:51.120 --> 14:52.880]  always
[14:52.880 --> 14:58.080]  But this year they seem to broaden both the keynote and the state of the Union and a lot of the sessions. Yeah
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.960]  Well, we mentioned I mentioned it with with the Schiller last week where you know
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.960]  They've broken this street where there weren't any women in the regular keynote now
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.000]  There've been women in the state of the Union. I believe for a while and as a lot of people have brought up
[15:12.720 --> 15:16.000]  For years and years. I in fact as long as I've been going to WWDC
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.560]  This isn't even a new thing in the regular sessions. There have always been plenty of them that were presented
[15:23.600 --> 15:30.160]  By women either as the primary presenter or as one of the secondary presenters who comes up just to demo a certain thing
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.840]  simply because it they're always as long as I've
[15:34.960 --> 15:38.320]  Known anybody at the company. They've always been a ton of talented women in
[15:39.120 --> 15:45.360]  You know in the engineering ranks and that's who presents at WWDC if you're you know if there's a new API
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.360]  for
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.120]  Watch complications whoever worked on watch complications part of the API does the presenting
[15:54.720 --> 15:56.240]  Yeah, there's you know, there's
[15:56.240 --> 16:01.040]  And I like that you brought that up with Shiller early on and then
[16:02.080 --> 16:07.360]  I felt he addressed it well because I mean you said finally and he said well it's a good start which you know
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.120]  I'd totally believe in
[16:09.280 --> 16:12.640]  But there's a lot of really talented women just developers
[16:13.440 --> 16:20.080]  Oh, and and the thing is you write like you party your job if you're an apple at that level is to be able to present
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.440]  And they will spend the time with you and train you if you need it
[16:27.120 --> 16:32.080]  But you know when it's your stuff and you're the your responsible for you expect it to get up and talk about it
[16:32.480 --> 16:35.280]  Either internally which can also be really ever anymore
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.480]  You know in this case external and the one thing I know that they're not going to do in that and Shiller's answer last week
[16:40.560 --> 16:45.600]  Emphasize it's it's people it's still people who are responsible for this so part of you know the real thing isn't
[16:45.920 --> 16:48.400]  Hey, we need to pick more women to be in the morning keynote
[16:48.400 --> 16:53.120]  It's we need to make sure that the talented women in the company are getting promoted
[16:53.360 --> 16:56.320]  When they should be to be to have these areas of responsibility
[16:57.120 --> 17:03.280]  And combined with that I think it's what you mentioned before is that they've just in general
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  Broadened the number of people
[17:06.560 --> 17:10.720]  Regardless of whether they're men women whether you know whatever skin color they have
[17:11.200 --> 17:16.320]  Just that there's more than just the top three or four people will get to present stuff in the keynote and
[17:16.320 --> 17:18.320]  Yeah, I mean, I do think the
[17:19.680 --> 17:25.120]  I forget what that page is but you know the scene of the president's on that page. I mean that's you know predominantly white
[17:26.080 --> 17:28.080]  older men
[17:28.080 --> 17:34.800]  And that's you know, that's not great, but it's also the truth and it's a sad reflection on the state of the industry as as it is evolved
[17:35.840 --> 17:37.040]  not that
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.240]  These people are awesome and good at the judge, but you know to me and like the there is certainly a lag time between
[17:43.360 --> 17:45.360]  Successful women getting up
[17:45.360 --> 17:51.680]  Well, and it's slowly happening and and and it's really nice to see that I'm taking it seriously
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.120]  I don't feel the pain lip service to it because I know that there's a lot of women in
[17:59.120 --> 18:04.160]  And there happened some you know there it is changing in the right direction
[18:04.160 --> 18:09.920]  So Lisa Jackson is now she's not a senior vice president. She's vice president, but she's in charge of their environmental stuff
[18:10.800 --> 18:13.920]  And their human resources chief is a woman. I you know, I've never met her
[18:13.920 --> 18:15.920]  But her name is Denise Janice Smith
[18:16.720 --> 18:18.720]  She's a black woman
[18:18.720 --> 18:26.040]  Lisa Jackson is a black woman or a woman of color or whatever the right terminology is but you know clearly adds to the diversity of that page
[18:26.240 --> 18:32.000]  The one thing that I so many people at readers and listeners of the show have have speculated on ever since
[18:32.480 --> 18:38.160]  She joined the company was that Angela Arntz was going to become a major part of the keynote and I
[18:38.160 --> 18:46.240]  It had a well exactly. I think the re I think what some people thought was hey Apple only lets the SVP's speak
[18:46.800 --> 18:48.320]  on keynotes
[18:48.320 --> 18:49.840]  She's the first
[18:49.840 --> 18:56.080]  Non white guy in this in the SVP's you know the senior vice president. So obviously she's going to speak
[18:56.720 --> 19:02.240]  Whereas the way it works is she's only going to get to speak if there's something about retail that is worth
[19:02.240 --> 19:08.720]  Putting in a keynote like if they do something if there's like a major new redesign of the retail stores and it's worth
[19:08.720 --> 19:14.720]  Hey, you know, let's spend 10 minutes of this keynote explaining this major new initiative
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.040]  We're taking with our retail stores then she'll get to do it because that's her that's her domain
[19:19.040 --> 19:21.040]  But she they're not going to bring her up to talk about
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.160]  The sales figures in media
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.840]  What like revenue or something completely unrelated like
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.400]  Apple pay right they weren't going to have heard. Yeah. Well, no
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.760]  They had to yeah, they had the woman
[19:37.600 --> 19:42.400]  Because that's her domain right and and really what it is is that like and it's like what shoulder said last week
[19:42.400 --> 19:44.080]  It's so Jennifer Bailey
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.960]  She's a vice president of the company. She's not on that page, but she's a vice president and she's in charge of Apple pay
[19:50.480 --> 19:52.640]  She's a better. She's been a little yeah
[19:52.640 --> 19:57.680]  Yeah, definitely has been around for a long time and then Susan Prescott was the other woman on stage in the keynote
[19:57.680 --> 20:03.040]  And she's a vice president in the app's division. So she's high up and she's definitely in charge of you know
[20:03.040 --> 20:05.040]  She did the news thing
[20:05.040 --> 20:07.040]  So she's you know
[20:07.040 --> 20:09.840]  The you know the chief of that I guess you know
[20:09.840 --> 20:13.600]  She the whole news thing is under her so it made sense for her to do the demo
[20:14.160 --> 20:19.520]  But it was only because they're expanding to like other lower levels of the company that they can do stuff like that
[20:19.520 --> 20:21.520]  Which I think is great
[20:21.520 --> 20:23.520]  Yeah, and you know Apple has had
[20:23.520 --> 20:31.680]  Historical you know Ellen Hancock was a chief technical officer when they bought next but that's but holding Ellen
[20:32.160 --> 20:36.320]  I know that yeah holding Ellen Hancock up as hey, there have been women in keynotes
[20:36.320 --> 20:40.240]  It's a bit of it was a bit of a stretch and it was wearing thin. Oh, no, I don't mean to do that
[20:40.240 --> 20:43.840]  I just I just mean that you know to have in the past being
[20:44.400 --> 20:49.840]  Women in high levels, you know sea level executives. Yeah, and obviously they're not doing enough well
[20:49.840 --> 20:56.720]  It's not that they're not enough, but I mean this kind of systemic change takes time
[20:57.520 --> 21:05.760]  Right like I think just cherry picking people to be either appear on the keynote is is is wrong and they're not doing that. They're they are
[21:08.800 --> 21:16.480]  They're building up a good stable of like really effective speakers and and it I'm really happy that they're kind of
[21:16.480 --> 21:18.000]  um
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.680]  Explardening
[21:19.680 --> 21:24.560]  more than like the four to five sort of characters that we used to see like you show her
[21:25.520 --> 21:27.360]  Used not you know used to jump off a roof
[21:28.320 --> 21:35.600]  With a Wi-Fi thing, right? Like they're and you know these were characters and there it seems like they're expanding a little bit beyond that
[21:36.240 --> 21:38.720]  Um, and that's I think that's good for
[21:39.520 --> 21:42.880]  The fapple and good good guys. I think sure we'll go down as well
[21:42.880 --> 21:48.720]  He certainly to this day. The only he might end up being the only person ever who performed an actual stunt
[21:49.760 --> 21:51.760]  Live freak you know
[21:52.000 --> 21:57.840]  Yeah, exactly. I mean Google was still trying to catch up when they did that thing with the GoPro is jumping out of plane onto the top of
[21:57.840 --> 21:59.520]  Yeah, remember that
[21:59.520 --> 22:03.840]  Yeah, guess what when you know when you strap your VP or senior VP of marketing
[22:04.880 --> 22:07.680]  On to a plane and we can talk
[22:08.400 --> 22:11.920]  Let me take also, you know what it's funny because for years he's
[22:11.920 --> 22:15.120]  Surely came across as the youth because you played it that way
[22:15.600 --> 22:17.600]  He is well
[22:17.600 --> 22:19.600]  But it was yeah, definitely
[22:19.600 --> 22:24.000]  You knew that anecdotally, but just your conversation with the musites is no dummy
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.000]  No, absolutely not no, and he's very very quick and you can
[22:28.640 --> 22:31.040]  You know there were a couple of things like he knew I was gonna bring up
[22:31.360 --> 22:35.280]  But there were a couple other things I didn't and I as I was asking the cover in six
[22:35.280 --> 22:43.040]  There's like five people in that room to really get that I saw some tweets afterwards
[22:43.040 --> 22:45.760]  The people who the people who really got that joke really loved it
[22:45.760 --> 22:49.840]  They felt like yeah, maybe that put it and he handled it really just
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.560]  And he gave like a shrug like all right. You got me there
[22:53.440 --> 22:57.920]  Yeah, exactly, but that might be it might be a good example of the last time that apples
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.280]  You know that that that apple pulled the carpet out from anybody
[23:01.280 --> 23:05.360]  You know in terms of that general discussion of hey, we give hints
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.360]  And if you follow our hints, you know your job will be easier going forward
[23:09.760 --> 23:11.920]  Yeah, and he's totally right and you know
[23:11.920 --> 23:14.000]  That's kind of the exception that puts it real
[23:14.640 --> 23:17.440]  Because the year before they'd be encouraging it and then they were like yeah
[23:17.440 --> 23:18.960]  No, we're not gonna do that
[23:19.040 --> 23:21.040]  So that kind of sucked but
[23:21.600 --> 23:24.800]  He said is their track record was pretty good
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.680]  He didn't even say they were banging a thousand to get that right a thousand a thousand would be the best
[23:29.680 --> 23:33.920]  Yes, it's one hundred percent. Okay. You didn't even say that. He said that you know
[23:34.640 --> 23:36.640]  It's pretty good, and it is pretty good
[23:37.600 --> 23:41.120]  So yeah, all right, let me take a break. Thank her. Do you want to thank her first?
[23:42.160 --> 23:45.040]  We actually haven't talked about anything, but we will
[23:46.640 --> 23:51.360]  Our first sponsor is our good friends at Harries. You guys know Harries. They make
[23:52.400 --> 23:54.400]  Really high quality shaving products
[23:54.400 --> 24:00.000]  They've got little kits they here's the deal you go to Harries.com and
[24:00.720 --> 24:07.920]  You can buy it get started you can get a kit it starts it just like 15 bucks you get a razor blade you get a couple a couple of blades
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.400]  Some shaving cream
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.920]  Really really high-end stuff. It's so nice. It's so much better made better designed
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.200]  Then then the stuff from gelat or chic or whatever they help other mainstream brands
[24:21.200 --> 24:26.720]  I just noticed I've got so that the one they have they've they've got one called the Truman set. It's got this orange
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.040]  Like a plastic handle the one I have and it's from years now
[24:31.040 --> 24:32.960]  I mean if anybody's been listening to the show now
[24:32.960 --> 24:34.960]  You know how long harries has been an occasional
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.680]  sponsor of the show and when they got started they sent me this the Winston kit and I still have that it's got a metal handle
[24:41.680 --> 24:46.160]  That's 25 bucks a little bit more expensive because it's made a metal. I was actually looking at mine the other day now
[24:46.160 --> 24:48.160]  I've had it at least two years. I was looking at it
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.160]  And I usually shave in the shower and it always it drops it falls in the tub all the time
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.920]  I was looking at it. It looks brand new like it looks like I could put it back in the box and
[25:00.400 --> 25:04.880]  Sell it back to somebody as mint condition. The stuff is really really made the last
[25:07.280 --> 25:09.360]  Really well designed just sort of a classic look
[25:10.400 --> 25:13.040]  and they'd really take this stuff seriously they
[25:13.040 --> 25:18.800]  The blades they were buying them from some company in Germany their German made blades
[25:18.800 --> 25:23.120]  And they like them so much that they just bought the whole factory and they're make they that's it
[25:23.120 --> 25:28.240]  They make their own blades, so they're not like just putting the harry's brand on you know
[25:29.200 --> 25:34.800]  White label razor blades that they buy from anybody in the commodity market. They make their own blades. They're really good
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.400]  And the whole point of reason they can they can sell this stuff so much cheaper is that they're cutting out the middle man
[25:40.400 --> 25:44.080]  They make this stuff. They package it. They put it in really cool boxes
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.240]  You buy it and then they just ship it right to you free of charge free shipping on everything
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.800]  So there's no mark-up that you get by going through distributors and distributors selling it to drug stores
[25:55.360 --> 26:01.040]  And the drugstore is putting their markup on it and then the drug stores because there's people shoplift stuff like razor blades
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.560]  All the time putting it behind those stupid glass cabinets with a lock and then you got to find an employee none of that
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.840]  You just go to harries.com. You know order it 15 bucks will get you everything you need to get started
[26:12.480 --> 26:18.240]  And then once you find out that the stuff is just as good as I've been telling you you can order stuff like new blades
[26:19.520 --> 26:26.080]  They're under two bucks a pop if you get them in quantity way less than then the big brands are
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.200]  Even when you buy them at places like Amazon if you get like a Gillette or whatever other brand like that
[26:31.200 --> 26:36.160]  So you pay less you get a better product and it could not be more convenient
[26:36.720 --> 26:43.360]  So great stuff if you have any reason to buy any kind of shaving stuff go check them out. Here's where you go you go to harries.com
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.400]  and
[26:46.400 --> 26:52.800]  Use the code talk show know the just talk show and on your first order you'll save five bucks
[26:52.800 --> 27:02.520]  A fantastic deal. So go there check them out harries.com and the code is just plain talk show no joke. I use them all the time
[27:02.520 --> 27:04.720]  they they sponsored a show to you and
[27:05.680 --> 27:08.960]  I got hooked and I do use it so use debug
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.200]  I don't I don't speak it don't because I don't actually think that exists
[27:13.760 --> 27:19.840]  That's the talk show you could try debug. No, I think harries is one of the ones. But but I swear to God. I do use it like I'm
[27:19.840 --> 27:26.080]  I'm actually a fan. Yeah, I like I probably wouldn't have followed up, but they you know they sponsored us so they give us like
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.120]  the shaving creams and
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.160]  The the aftershave and the razor and the blades and you know now
[27:34.160 --> 27:35.600]  Yeah, and they've been doing a thing too
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.760]  Also like sort of like Apple does where they come out with the first thing and then they slowly iterate over time where they've
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.400]  Slowly added a few new things like they started out. I think they only had a shaving cream
[27:47.280 --> 27:48.480]  and
[27:48.480 --> 27:53.920]  They had one and not the other and I think they added the gel is the second thing because a lot of people prefer
[27:53.920 --> 27:59.680]  It does now you get a choice when you buy any kit you can choose between shaving cream shaving gel whichever one you prefer
[27:59.680 --> 28:01.680]  They've got both
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.600]  All sorts of other stuff and now they've got an answer. They had if you listen to me a few weeks ago
[28:05.600 --> 28:09.600]  If you were smart, you bought it for your father's day. They had a father's day kit, but they're already sold out of it
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.000]  Might be a little too late now anyway since shows not coming out until two days before anyway if you were smart two weeks ago
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.720]  You would have listened to me and bought that. Yeah, that's a good gift. You know what my
[28:22.560 --> 28:26.880]  My lady friend's dad wants a gun cleaning kit and a knife. Yeah, so
[28:27.760 --> 28:29.760]  You know, I'm gonna treat her right
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.240]  Like I seems like it's like a retired CIA guy or something. Yeah, I'm scared to death of this guy
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.120]  I hope he's not asking for that stuff because of you
[28:41.120 --> 28:48.240]  He died also too. All right, let's talk about some of this technical stuff from that the
[28:48.880 --> 28:50.880]  WWDC and it really is a lot
[28:52.240 --> 28:54.240]  Do you want to go any order of your
[28:54.560 --> 29:01.200]  Your outline? Well, I mean because we segue from the shillers. So yeah, yeah, so the first thing that you have in the list
[29:01.200 --> 29:03.760]  And I think it's a good topic is the app thinning and
[29:03.760 --> 29:10.960]  And I think that I think that ties into the whole idea that from Federigi in the morning keynote about how they've
[29:11.600 --> 29:18.240]  Significantly cut down on what's going to be the over-the-air size of or or I don't know about the over-the-air size
[29:18.240 --> 29:26.600]  But the minimum required open storage on your device to get started with the update to iOS 9. I think it's got to be really
[29:26.600 --> 29:30.400]  Yeah, I think so I think it was a six to seven
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.040]  It went from like the you needed like four gigabytes free four gigs down to like one point
[29:35.040 --> 29:40.160]  So I think there's probably two things are a app thinning which we'll describe in good detail in the moment
[29:40.960 --> 29:43.600]  and probably that new fancy bands
[29:44.560 --> 29:46.560]  Comps a
[29:47.360 --> 29:50.800]  Confession algorithm they mentioned it's probably a combination thing
[29:50.800 --> 29:54.880]  I wonder too if they're doing some of the resource stuff over, you know like
[29:55.840 --> 29:58.160]  Oh, definitely sorry. Yeah when it so app thinning is
[29:58.160 --> 30:00.160]  Three things basically
[30:03.600 --> 30:07.560]  And it is on-demand resources which are
[30:09.680 --> 30:14.200]  If you the example that they give is a game where if you
[30:15.600 --> 30:20.240]  You're not going to get to level 10 if you just start playing the game until a little bit
[30:20.240 --> 30:23.680]  So you can have resources that are included in your application
[30:23.680 --> 30:28.240]  But are not actually downloaded from the app store until you start to need to use them
[30:29.600 --> 30:35.760]  So that's big so that you download. It's gonna be small, but you can actually have a big application in general
[30:37.200 --> 30:40.080]  It used to be like I remember back in
[30:41.760 --> 30:43.760]  2008 2009 when we were shipping
[30:44.640 --> 30:46.240]  Tapped after revenge stuff we
[30:46.240 --> 30:55.120]  Sweated getting the app down to the size where it would be okay to download over cellular
[30:55.840 --> 30:58.720]  And I forget what it was that's like 10 megabytes something like that
[30:59.760 --> 31:04.880]  And we had like a lot of graphics and audio files which you know and between that up
[31:07.760 --> 31:15.280]  So, you know, I think now the direct download size is limited I forget what it's limited to and it's kind of a moving target
[31:15.280 --> 31:20.760]  But the total download size with these on-demand resources is about 20. Yeah, and it's definitely an issue
[31:20.760 --> 31:25.680]  I I see it a lot. I don't download a lot of games myself, but Jonas does and it's
[31:26.640 --> 31:28.640]  it's always like a
[31:28.720 --> 31:30.720]  You know sitting on a whoopie cushion
[31:31.240 --> 31:35.360]  Emotionally when it's like hey can I get this new app and you know we say yes
[31:35.360 --> 31:39.920]  But we're out, you know who knows you know we're out and about we're not in the house and it's like
[31:39.920 --> 31:46.640]  Wa-wa it's over the over the cellular download limit and so it's definitely a big deal and you know
[31:47.040 --> 31:52.160]  That was a huge engineering challenge first like we we sweated that because you need the impulse box
[31:52.160 --> 31:57.600]  Yeah for those kind of pop games, you know because I mean I mean I mean do you join us remember that when you go
[31:57.600 --> 32:04.560]  Sometimes and sometimes not right and and even if it's even if most of the time you still remember to get the same game
[32:04.560 --> 32:07.760]  When you're back on wi-fi you're gonna lose some some number of
[32:07.760 --> 32:12.640]  Uh downloads that you would have gotten otherwise. Yeah, and that's a definite. They should be a big deal
[32:12.720 --> 32:14.720]  So I think it's a huge win for
[32:15.440 --> 32:17.120]  game developers
[32:17.120 --> 32:19.120]  Yeah, so I mean this does go to the
[32:21.120 --> 32:24.320]  Shills American the 16 gigabyte, which was kind of an unanswered
[32:24.960 --> 32:27.280]  Little bit, but at the same time
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.680]  They're backing that up with a bunch of this technology that that they've put into
[32:32.080 --> 32:35.760]  iOS 9 in order to try to make that I mean he
[32:35.760 --> 32:40.560]  I don't I don't want to say waffle, but he was vague and had way to you about
[32:41.360 --> 32:43.360]  what we're doing more things with the cloud
[32:43.920 --> 32:44.560]  uh
[32:44.560 --> 32:46.560]  but
[32:46.560 --> 32:50.160]  You know the the technology that they've actually been adding
[32:51.040 --> 32:57.680]  Supports that supports the fact that they or supports the argument that they really do want to make 16 gigabytes of value
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.280]  um
[32:59.280 --> 33:00.720]  not a value
[33:00.720 --> 33:02.720]  a viable
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.720]  flute chain for
[33:04.720 --> 33:10.880]  Well, and like my argument was I'm guessing most people listening to this episode probably listened to that episode
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.880]  I mean that episode pretty good numbers
[33:13.840 --> 33:19.040]  I hope so stop listening to my but my argument my framing was that apple
[33:19.760 --> 33:27.120]  Ever since Steve came back has done this good better best three-way framing of a product line and that to me with the 64
[33:27.760 --> 33:29.920]  16 64 128 split
[33:29.920 --> 33:36.240]  It's a little bit more like okay better best like it's hard for me to justify calling 16 good and you know
[33:36.400 --> 33:40.160]  He he made the best case he could I think that 16 is pretty good
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.600]  And and depending on your needs that if you're gonna shoot a lot of video then no you want to upgrade
[33:46.160 --> 33:48.160]  But if you were buying
[33:47.840 --> 33:52.880]  Devices for a enterprise type employee type thing that you don't need that
[33:52.880 --> 33:59.200]  Yeah, and you know that you can store stuff like with photo even with video you can use iCloud
[33:59.840 --> 34:04.000]  Photo storage and not keep all of your video on your device
[34:04.560 --> 34:08.400]  And still have access to it on the fly when you need it by downloading it when you need it
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.560]  Yeah, I mean if your company is buying a thousand of these and giving them out to employees
[34:12.960 --> 34:14.960]  it's for emailing
[34:14.960 --> 34:16.960]  doing talented messages and that kind of stuff and
[34:16.960 --> 34:23.920]  It's you know, maybe 60 gigs is fine for that also. I like I did I mean not to get to met it
[34:23.920 --> 34:25.920]  But the way you find that question was good
[34:26.480 --> 34:28.480]  because you I mean you kind of
[34:29.120 --> 34:32.640]  You backed it off good better best and then
[34:33.680 --> 34:38.400]  And showed that it wasn't actually that good so um on the other hand
[34:39.920 --> 34:41.920]  You know they are making
[34:41.920 --> 34:46.880]  They're investing a lot of software effort in order to make these lower
[34:47.760 --> 34:49.760]  Capacity phones
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.080]  The other thing I got so I got a lot of feedback on that question from people and some people were like wow
[34:54.080 --> 34:58.080]  You did a great like what you just said you did a great job framing that in a way that you know
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.600]  You asked a tough question, but you didn't in a respectful way where you weren't
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.560]  Being you know, it wasn't confrontational
[35:05.520 --> 35:07.520]  other people were like
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.640]  You didn't you should have followed up on that after his answer and pressed him on it further
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.320]  Or other people who made what is a good point
[35:16.960 --> 35:23.040]  Was that I'm it's like my own personal perspective on this where I'm really only interested in the current generation devices
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.200]  I didn't even mention the fact that they're still selling eight gigabyte devices
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.880]  Like if you buy the iPhone 5c, which is the one that's I think currently free with contract
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.480]  Uh, you only get eight gigabytes of storage, which is really low
[35:36.880 --> 35:39.600]  But I do think like you said like with this whole app thinning thing
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.720]  They're not it's not like they're selling them and engineering has software engineering has left them behind
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.160]  They're like I think more than ever they're really focused on
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.080]  Making sure that the entire array of these iOS devices that they're selling are
[35:54.800 --> 35:56.080]  are
[35:56.080 --> 36:00.400]  Moderately useful to you know pretty pretty good devices going forward
[36:00.400 --> 36:02.960]  Yeah, my other I mean
[36:04.560 --> 36:09.520]  This is pretty much I'm substantiated, but my understanding is that the the
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.640]  Ram chips that they use in the 16 gigabyte
[36:14.320 --> 36:16.320]  They don't come in 32
[36:16.320 --> 36:22.080]  Yeah, so they need to find a different supplier like things get like there's complicated stuff there that
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.120]  Yeah, that's that's something I think we there's like there's some basic we heard this from the same person last week
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  But you know sort of off the record. Yeah
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.320]  But that it's a little bit more complicated than just the product marketing implications of
[36:37.040 --> 36:39.040]  The way that it
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.720]  If 16 to 64 to 128 is the split boy
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.240]  There's an awful lot of people who are if they were on the fence might have gone with the look if it was 32 at the low end
[36:48.240 --> 36:50.880]  would have bought that 32 but instead by the
[36:51.520 --> 36:54.560]  $100 spend that extra $100 to get the 64
[36:54.560 --> 37:00.960]  Clearly that's part of it, but that we heard that there's a technical reason and it was that that it sounds crazy
[37:00.960 --> 37:04.960]  Because I know that if the if the 32 gigabyte chick chips did exist
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.200]  It wouldn't be it's not a hundred dollar expense to Apple. It's a couple of bucks at the most
[37:09.440 --> 37:11.440]  But then but that there were
[37:12.400 --> 37:15.600]  Something very very specific about these chips, but that the 32 ones
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.600]  Actually weren't there and that if they wanted to have them in the quantities they needed 16 was actually you know
[37:21.600 --> 37:23.600]  There was actually like a
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.600]  Would you call it an operational
[37:26.160 --> 37:32.240]  Advantage to 16 64 or 128 right? Yeah, so you know, I mean, you know that
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.600]  I can't it's not like I've spoken to the game. It actually buys all of the stuff
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.400]  But you know, I that seems plausible to me and it's also not something feels
[37:43.440 --> 37:48.400]  So but on the other hand, they're trying to make it work. So earlier. I'll do this software technology is
[37:48.400 --> 37:54.800]  Yeah, and a lot of it there's an awful lot of things. It's going to keep coming up because if we even get to swift and stuff like that
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.120]  But boy the whole and you know, and and one of the things that Shuler said last week
[37:59.120 --> 38:03.840]  And I do think we're starting to see is is that a lot of these things are years in the making and
[38:04.800 --> 38:08.880]  Some of it many years may be close to a decade. I mean when did Apple first?
[38:08.880 --> 38:17.840]  Bring Chris Latner in hire him and sort of adopt LLVM as as their official, you know compiler technology going forward
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.720]  Oh, I should know this off the top of my head
[38:21.760 --> 38:22.800]  It may not
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.520]  It's probably close to less than close to tenure close to but I think less like
[38:28.320 --> 38:30.320]  I think 10 years is on the outside
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.640]  Because he wrote a brilliant paper and he got LLVM going
[38:35.600 --> 38:37.600]  basically because
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.000]  GCC stank and that's not a I
[38:42.720 --> 38:48.240]  Don't know if there's a lot of open source to it's listen to this and they're going to get all bent out of shape about GCC
[38:48.240 --> 38:51.200]  But it was great for its time really hard to
[38:51.920 --> 38:57.200]  Sort of make the advancements that are that was saying with the LLVM
[38:57.200 --> 39:06.880]  The I mean free BSDs adopted it. I think there's some some work for Linux, but I can never keep track of all of that
[39:07.840 --> 39:13.120]  From Wikipedia reports that Apple hired him in 2005 so 10 years
[39:14.320 --> 39:20.080]  Okay, and obviously they've been reaping rewards from that big and small of every year step by step
[39:20.080 --> 39:27.600]  But yeah, it's changed the development too, but it's really starting to the the way that that's
[39:28.160 --> 39:34.480]  It's not just like I the first couple of years of advantages of switching from GSC to LLVM
[39:34.960 --> 39:36.560]  We're really about
[39:36.560 --> 39:42.800]  Developers were the only people who saw those advantages and now we're starting to see this trickle out into
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.920]  User-facing features things that would not have been possible with GCC. I believe
[39:47.920 --> 39:49.920]  Like
[39:52.160 --> 39:53.200]  Oh
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.640]  Don't you think you think I'm wrong? No, you're totally wrong. Oh, I know
[40:00.160 --> 40:08.160]  Just just to double down on on Leonard Ladner is at like a snowball rolling downhill, and it's like exponential impact
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.040]  He's doing a good job
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.840]  We'll get to swerve eventually, but he's killing it so absolizing is
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.480]  Back in the next days before Apple even bought them
[40:21.360 --> 40:28.240]  They had what was called fat boundaries, which are what we call universal boundaries, which basically had
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.040]  Co-segments for each of the different
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.200]  chip architectures that the application is going on so you know power PC or Intel or HP or
[40:37.760 --> 40:39.920]  Some spark stations that kind of thing
[40:40.960 --> 40:42.960]  The idea is that there's a tiny
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.520]  Sort of table of contents at the beginning of the file and then you
[40:49.040 --> 41:00.080]  Jump to the correct page and start and start reading the same book in in your own language and one book would help like four or five different
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.240]  Versions of the text each translated as appropriate for the architecture that you were running on
[41:07.600 --> 41:11.360]  And those were called fat binaries that that became universal apps
[41:11.360 --> 41:17.120]  on the Mac with Intel and power PC and now a 32 and 64 bit arm
[41:18.000 --> 41:18.960]  and
[41:18.960 --> 41:24.400]  One of the things that would happen on old next machines was that people would run a
[41:25.520 --> 41:28.560]  command line which I believe still exists it's called
[41:29.040 --> 41:35.200]  LiPo and well LiPo would go into one of the executable files and strip out the architectures
[41:35.200 --> 41:42.320]  that weren't native to where you're going to run the app and that would save you some space and back in those days
[41:42.320 --> 41:45.280]  There wasn't a lot of space so that that would be something that you know
[41:46.240 --> 41:48.240]  People would like to do
[41:48.880 --> 41:52.800]  App slicing is very similar except that it happens on the App Store level
[41:54.640 --> 41:56.640]  When you download an app
[41:56.960 --> 41:58.960]  I was nine using App slicing
[41:58.960 --> 42:05.280]  Only the code that is appropriate for the device that you're downloading it for will be downloaded
[42:05.760 --> 42:08.240]  So you won't have extraneous code for
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.320]  32 bit arm
[42:10.320 --> 42:12.320]  64 bit arm and then one happier
[42:13.200 --> 42:19.520]  Further and this is probably the biggest win is that resources will be called that aren't appropriate
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.040]  So if you have like an iPhone 6
[42:23.040 --> 42:29.360]  Yeah, you will only download the act 2x instead of the 3x resources that
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.400]  Should be included yet for the 6 plus right?
[42:33.200 --> 42:35.200]  Right, so
[42:35.520 --> 42:37.520]  It will only it will be the minimum
[42:37.920 --> 42:40.880]  Footprint. It will be only exactly what the application needs
[42:43.040 --> 42:45.840]  And that will you know that that
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.640]  Will be have huge gains in terms of the application download size and the footprint on the device itself
[42:52.640 --> 42:54.640]  Yeah
[42:55.360 --> 42:58.400]  And it's yeah, it seems like that's going to be a big deal and it happens
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.520]  So you submit as a developer you submit one app with everything all of your resources
[43:04.080 --> 43:06.080]  You're 32 bit you're 64 bit
[43:07.040 --> 43:14.400]  Compiled output you submit that to the App Store and then the App Store takes care of serving the
[43:14.960 --> 43:19.840]  Slice up here's the here's here's only what you need version to the customers
[43:19.840 --> 43:21.600]  right
[43:21.600 --> 43:22.880]  Yeah
[43:22.880 --> 43:29.760]  Which is great and it's one of the benefits of having an app store you get to slice and dice as you need them and download the
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.680]  appropriate right and so it's another way that apps can A
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.720]  It just saves everything anyway. It's less energy less networking. It's you know
[43:39.440 --> 43:42.480]  Little bit, you know little it's good for everybody to say everything's gonna be faster
[43:42.480 --> 43:45.280]  But it's another way that apps can get under the cellular limit too
[43:45.280 --> 43:47.760]  Oh
[43:47.760 --> 43:48.800]  Definitely
[43:48.800 --> 43:54.720]  Yeah, on demand was is a big one and app slicing will also help a lot and especially with the
[43:56.160 --> 44:01.200]  There's so many devices now with so many requirements and resources are getting kind of blowing out
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.040]  It's going to help a lot. It's going to
[44:05.360 --> 44:11.080]  Make it so that every app that you download is same in terms of you
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.320]  Yeah, because one of the other one of the other things that's interesting to me about iOS now
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.240]  I'm not surprised because they're still selling the A5 with
[44:19.440 --> 44:23.200]  The entry model non retina iPad mini
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.720]  And since they're still selling it that makes sense that they're still supporting it with iOS 9
[44:29.440 --> 44:35.120]  But you know presumably they're gonna have new iPads and new iPhones later this year
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.040]  So it's only going to be adding to the number of devices
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.160]  So now we're going all the way from a non retino 1x stuff like the the
[44:45.440 --> 44:48.160]  Like I said the entry level iPad mini the
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.560]  iPad touch is our pod touch is still being sold those are a5 devices that are
[44:55.280 --> 45:01.920]  I guess the iPod touch is retina, but you know they're still non retina device being sold still being supported all the way up to
[45:02.160 --> 45:04.160]  3x devices like the 6 Plus
[45:04.160 --> 45:07.920]  Yeah, yeah, and the you know
[45:10.080 --> 45:13.440]  Again, this kind of backs up what Sheila is playing with
[45:14.080 --> 45:16.080]  Trying to make you know that that's a big investment
[45:18.000 --> 45:21.840]  You know that they put a lot of work into making that work or happen so
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.840]  You know it's not just lip servers and trying to fob it off as some like the marketing guys being like no, no
[45:27.840 --> 45:33.040]  It's great. They're they're trying to so another thing they announced and I think this is the first time is that
[45:33.040 --> 45:39.760]  And this is it's a real struggle for developers if they're if you're doing something that really presses the limits of the device
[45:40.240 --> 45:42.240]  Think high-end game
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.240]  Think something like pixel meter for iOS
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.120]  You're really really stretching the limits if you want to both take advantage of the latest
[45:53.760 --> 45:58.560]  hardware and the fastest graphics stuff that's that's on like the current state of the art
[45:58.560 --> 46:05.040]  iPhone and iPad and yet still be able to even launch on the a5-based ones
[46:06.880 --> 46:11.040]  So well, they still have to write the same code well, but the one thing they mean
[46:11.040 --> 46:12.800]  Vaps well the other thing that they announced
[46:12.800 --> 46:18.560]  This was in the morning keynote with with Craig where they announced that you if it's up to you as the developer
[46:18.560 --> 46:21.520]  But you can submit an app now for iOS that
[46:22.160 --> 46:23.360]  requires
[46:23.360 --> 46:25.360]  64-bit
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.960]  Yeah, oh that yeah, that's huge and effectively that means the
[46:31.840 --> 46:38.320]  A7 or later because the a7 with the iPhone 5s was the first 64-bit
[46:39.360 --> 46:41.360]  Yeah, they're very rarely
[46:42.080 --> 46:43.360]  Given us
[46:43.360 --> 46:45.360]  for like a better word
[46:45.360 --> 46:48.240]  Breakpoints in terms of what can and can't be supported
[46:48.240 --> 46:54.480]  Generally, they want if an OS level supports it. They want their parties to support it
[46:56.800 --> 46:58.800]  This is one of the few that
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.520]  And you know they added this in order to exactly like support stuff like i and graphics stuff or i and games
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.320]  Because you know like a lot of these things the older architectures just can't handle it and you can
[47:14.320 --> 47:16.320]  And
[47:16.320 --> 47:22.800]  The development burden of supporting these older systems is going to outweigh any benefit they have to them
[47:23.280 --> 47:27.120]  And yet in the app store, there's no way to indicate that well
[47:27.760 --> 47:30.320]  There is but it's terrible like I've seen it
[47:30.320 --> 47:32.320]  I'm sure as you see like in the app description
[47:33.200 --> 47:36.880]  It'll it'll say hey if you if you're not using
[47:36.880 --> 47:43.440]  The you know a7 or above or something like that. They'll say don't download this game. Yeah
[47:45.120 --> 47:47.120]  Yeah
[47:47.120 --> 47:52.320]  Yeah, I'm I mean to express that in a manner such that the app store can
[47:53.680 --> 47:55.680]  Nobody wants to cheat the customers
[47:56.080 --> 47:58.080]  Well, I mean some people do well
[47:58.800 --> 48:04.560]  The majority of people are good actors and nobody wants them to download something that they can't possibly run and yet there was no
[48:04.560 --> 48:12.800]  Programmatic or or there was no way to express that this game requires a certain level of hardware in order to be even remotely fun
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.400]  So they've added that which isn't which is nice because I mean in the old days people who are switching on like
[48:19.360 --> 48:21.360]  Can this app shoot video?
[48:21.360 --> 48:27.200]  Yeah, like does it have a camera like there was some weird stuff that happened to coincide with like fast approaches
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.880]  And so they'd claim that they needed some certain part of gb. Yeah, like a video camera
[48:32.880 --> 48:37.440]  But yeah videos are good people camera GPS whatever it was. Yeah, it was like well
[48:37.840 --> 48:40.960]  we know that this device is faster and
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  It also has this other thing
[48:44.720 --> 48:50.000]  So we're gonna peg it on the other thing in order to trick the app store into not limiting who can buy it
[48:50.880 --> 48:53.360]  That's a crummy experience all around
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.400]  Because you like to Apple you lying to the customers and you know, it's just right
[48:58.400 --> 49:04.320]  Let's come back and talk about bit code, but let me do another sponsor read and but remind me if I
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.400]  Some want to do let me remember that where we'll pick this up is talking about bit code
[49:11.200 --> 49:19.240]  I want to tell you about our good friends at igloo igloo is the internet you will actually like
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.240]  You can share news organize files coordinate calendars manage projects
[49:24.240 --> 49:32.320]  And more all in one place. It's a place. It's an online internet for your team your organization your business
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.840]  Whatever you want to call it your group where you can do all this stuff in one place
[49:38.640 --> 49:46.160]  And you can do it on every device. It's all web-based. It works great. Everything looks great on phones tablets
[49:46.560 --> 49:48.080]  desktops
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.280]  Big displays small displays anything you want. It's gonna look great
[49:51.280 --> 49:59.120]  They're latest upgrade. They call it Viking. That's like the you know like the elkapi ton version number of their stuff
[49:59.120 --> 50:01.120]  They give names like that
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.520]  Viking revolves around
[50:03.600 --> 50:07.680]  Documents and how you interact with them gather feedback and make changes
[50:07.840 --> 50:13.120]  They've even had the ability to track who has read critical information to keep everyone on the same page
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.120]  So it's like read receipts in your email or read receipts on iMessage something like that
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.960]  But it's a lot more like iMessage than emails because it's not annoying. It's just a little indication of who's read what
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.080]  And that helps you track where their key colleagues have read and acknowledged
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.800]  Policies or legal agreements or something like that and if you don't need that then you don't need to you don't need to worry about it
[50:36.800 --> 50:38.800]  But if you do
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.960]  It's a major upgrade to igloo that maybe was keeping you from using it before so that's great
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.160]  If your company or your team has a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 90s
[50:48.160 --> 50:55.760]  It's probably because it was built in the 90s and you should give igloo a try. Here's where you go to find out more go to
[50:56.320 --> 50:58.320]  igloo software dot com
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.480]  slash the talk show
[51:01.280 --> 51:03.840]  And they have a tremendous tremendous free trial
[51:04.640 --> 51:06.880]  Format for ten people or fewer
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.120]  You could just use it in for as long as you want free of charge
[51:11.280 --> 51:14.800]  That's it and so if you've got a team that's fewer than ten people igloo is free
[51:14.800 --> 51:20.400]  Just use it and you don't even have to worry about it and then if you have more than ten people they have really really great pricing

[51:25.280 --> 51:29.040]  And get started and just see how good it can be so my thanks to igloo software
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.440]  dot com slash the talk show for sponsoring the show
[51:34.160 --> 51:36.160]  All right, what were we Canadians?
[51:37.200 --> 51:39.920]  Might as well be like I don't know maybe they are I think they are
[51:39.920 --> 51:44.160]  They're very nice, so I suspect that they are
[51:45.280 --> 51:47.840]  Every time I interact with them. They're very very nice people
[51:48.560 --> 51:51.600]  They got a big Canadian and see only see only explanation
[51:52.640 --> 51:55.600]  Oh, that's right bit code all right explain bit code
[51:55.600 --> 52:00.640]  And because I think that this this seems to me like something that even in the and the state of the union was sort of
[52:01.120 --> 52:03.120]  They went through this very very quickly
[52:03.680 --> 52:08.480]  And yeah, so they talked about it. They kind of skimmed over it
[52:08.480 --> 52:10.480]  Um
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.480]  The session explanation
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.840]  Originally mentioned it and then they expunched it like the update of the explanation in in the WWC app
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.480]  To remove mention of bit code and it wasn't really spoken about much publicly after that
[52:26.080 --> 52:28.080]  But
[52:28.080 --> 52:30.720]  my impression from what they said on stage was that
[52:32.080 --> 52:34.720]  Bit code was effectively a marketing term for
[52:34.720 --> 52:36.720]  Uh
[52:37.600 --> 52:42.160]  It's kind of get this is going to get nerdy but a bytecode like like sort of the Java
[52:42.880 --> 52:46.000]  Way of like you can pile things down to it to a bytecode where
[52:46.880 --> 52:53.520]  You can redeploy the same code across different platforms. Right like in a traditional compiler
[52:53.600 --> 52:55.600]  You compile to a specific
[52:56.400 --> 53:00.000]  processor instruction set so if you were on a
[53:00.720 --> 53:04.240]  You know an x86 chip your compiler generates
[53:04.240 --> 53:10.640]  x86 machine code that is directly it's the native language of the CPU
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.960]  exam bytecode and Java is probably the
[53:15.680 --> 53:21.680]  most famous example of this a Java compiler compiles to bytecode and the bytecode is
[53:22.560 --> 53:26.560]  It's low level, but it's the same bytecode can run on
[53:27.440 --> 53:29.440]  It's say
[53:29.440 --> 53:31.440]  Intel or power PC
[53:31.440 --> 53:35.040]  Right because it's interpreted by a virtual
[53:36.480 --> 53:37.840]  CPU
[53:37.840 --> 53:41.840]  Which is the runtime is that you know when people ask you to install Java
[53:42.400 --> 53:47.040]  That's what they mean right that they need you to install the Java runtime so that they can interpret this code
[53:47.680 --> 53:50.560]  So my understanding from what they said briefly
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.720]  Was that your code would be compiled down into a Java like bytecode
[53:57.920 --> 53:59.200]  And then
[53:59.200 --> 54:06.320]  recompiled by Apple with their latest compiler technology to target whatever new devices they felt like
[54:08.560 --> 54:10.560]  So this would enable stuff like
[54:11.280 --> 54:14.480]  like the CPU on the watch to change or
[54:15.680 --> 54:17.680]  Like an iPad with an Intel processor
[54:18.480 --> 54:21.520]  Because it would be dynamically recompiled when you tried to download it
[54:25.200 --> 54:26.400]  That's not the case
[54:26.400 --> 54:30.080]  It did sound like I have to say that sounded like what they said when I saw the the
[54:31.280 --> 54:34.080]  Well, that's what they said and I freaked out
[54:34.320 --> 54:37.680]  I was like that because you know I ship software
[54:38.240 --> 54:41.520]  I don't want my name attached to software that I have me noticed test
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.000]  So that was kind of a big that was troublesome
[54:47.040 --> 54:49.040]  um
[54:49.120 --> 54:51.120]  What actually happens is that
[54:51.120 --> 54:55.680]  um
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.960]  Bitcode which is what they call it and I know it's confusing is bytes and bits and whatever
[55:03.760 --> 55:05.760]  But the bit code that LLVM
[55:07.040 --> 55:09.040]  Emmits is
[55:09.840 --> 55:16.560]  Very much targeted to the processor that you planted the point on and the only changes that
[55:16.560 --> 55:19.680]  um Apple is going to make in this process are
[55:21.200 --> 55:23.200]  Quote provably correct
[55:23.760 --> 55:26.640]  Um and that gets hard to sort of explain
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.120]  uh
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.760]  If I'm doing something in the loop and at the beginning of the loop if I have to do something a hundred times and every time
[55:36.400 --> 55:38.400]  um, I have to write down
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.320]  Five different things that never change and memorize them
[55:43.040 --> 55:45.040]  um
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.240]  And then go through the loop and you know do all of the tasks that have to do and then do it again
[55:50.240 --> 55:53.920]  And then I have to write them all down again one optimization would be
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.280]  To well, why don't you just write them down once and use them every time through the loop now
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.840]  Modern compilers can do that for you. They can reorder your code
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.480]  in order
[56:06.640 --> 56:07.840]  To achieve
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.520]  Like efficiencies in this way and then to compile your code faster
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.920]  No, not to correct if those five things are that and you're saying it in this case
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.400]  Those five things are exactly the same and have to be exactly the same you can prove that they'll be exactly the same
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.040]  All hundred times through the loop
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.680]  Well, okay, so there's two things. There's there's yes. There's that which is
[56:30.480 --> 56:34.160]  the basically the the optimization level of rebutting code
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.400]  It'll pull those out and we'll put them on
[56:36.400 --> 56:41.040]  up top now the problem where that comes from is that if
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  Okay, here the stages. I'm gonna
[56:44.320 --> 56:46.960]  Ask you your name. I'm gonna ask you your
[56:47.920 --> 56:52.000]  Your family name and then I am going to write them down on a piece of paper
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.120]  And I'm gonna pass it to somebody else. That's my iteration, okay?
[56:55.760 --> 57:02.320]  Oh, I'm gonna and I'll probably add a number to how many times I've done it so that each iteration is a little bit different now
[57:02.320 --> 57:09.840]  Ask you your name ask you your family name. I write them down. I'm doing that over and over and over now
[57:11.040 --> 57:13.040]  one day
[57:13.040 --> 57:15.840]  You're like, you know what John is a shitty name
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.680]  I'm gonna call myself guy cuz that's an awesome name
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.760]  And so now when I when I go through the loop, I've asked you your name and it's now guy Gruber and
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.760]  And so the output you're making me feel weird
[57:32.960 --> 57:34.960]  Yeah, I know that's it's all right
[57:35.200 --> 57:40.640]  I'm trying to explain in advance compiler optimations. No, that's a pretty good stuff. So
[57:41.840 --> 57:43.840]  if you took those two
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.040]  Steps like asking you your name and your last name and I took them out of the loop
[57:49.920 --> 57:54.480]  Most of the time it'd be totally correct, but there's a weird edge case word
[57:54.480 --> 58:00.640]  By analyzing the code. You can't necessarily tell that you're likely to you may change your name at some point
[58:01.600 --> 58:04.560]  Right, so that breaks code
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.120]  And that's the kind of optimization that happens with like
[58:10.560 --> 58:17.920]  O3 or O2 like that you set a flag about how much you want the code to be optimized when you compile these things
[58:18.720 --> 58:22.240]  Debug has no optimization so you can step through and see exactly what's happening
[58:22.240 --> 58:28.560]  At higher and higher levels of optimization the compiler gets smarter smarter about doing this kind of thing, but
[58:30.320 --> 58:32.320]  The compiler is not always
[58:33.360 --> 58:36.960]  Able to reason fully about your code and
[58:38.320 --> 58:41.520]  Therefore can introduce some bugs
[58:43.200 --> 58:47.040]  So that's why I was concerned and you're saying with big code that cannot happen
[58:47.040 --> 58:55.040]  So with big code, they're different they they have already done that entire stage of trying to be smart and
[58:55.680 --> 59:01.760]  Moving, you know, rewriting the code in order to achieve algorithm making they've done that on your machine
[59:01.760 --> 59:09.040]  You the machine underneath your desk as a developer and so what what what you've gotten from Xcode on your machine
[59:09.440 --> 59:12.080]  You can test to your satisfaction
[59:12.080 --> 59:20.400]  Exactly yeah now what bit code will allow Apple to do and I'm going to come up with a
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  Similarly stupid example
[59:24.720 --> 59:26.720]  Is that
[59:27.200 --> 59:29.200]  If you have
[59:29.760 --> 59:32.800]  I don't know like some operations come like a multiple operation
[59:34.720 --> 59:36.720]  Maybe there's a fast way to do it
[59:36.720 --> 59:43.520]  Like if you're only multiplying powers of well be powers of two on a GPU bonus CPU
[59:43.520 --> 59:46.000]  But if you're only multiplying powers of
[59:46.880 --> 59:54.400]  Ten like so it's ten and a hundred and all that all you have to do is add a bunch of zeros, right? Like what logically? That's how you learn to do math
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:00.040]  There can be a very fast way to do multiplication
[1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:05.440]  That this compiler can take advantage of
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:08.960]  Because it's it's been introduced as a new
[1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:13.680]  It's called an intrinsic function like it's a new capability of the CPU
[1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.440]  Now a multiply is a multiply. It doesn't matter if it happens faster slow
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:24.240]  It's the same multiply the same order of operations apply like everything is fine
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:30.000]  whether they take a shortcut or they do the full-on multiply is
[1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:32.800]  You know is
[1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.520]  Something that is basically decision based on it that the CPU has to make
[1:00:38.880 --> 1:00:45.920]  And so Apple is basically reserving the right to change your code a little bit in order to better take advantage of these
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:47.520]  minute
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:58.560]  Optimization right and so it's not as has widely been speculated a way to future proof compiled code for as yet
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.520]  All together new processors
[1:01:02.720 --> 1:01:08.560]  That's my understanding. Yeah, this would be as hard to target retarget to a new processor as taking assembly
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:12.000]  And targeting it to a processor and under the hood
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:14.720]  So this article that was on
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:20.240]  There's a widely cited article written by I don't even know who it is like this he goes here
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:25.040]  He or she goes by the name inertial lemon and I don't know who this is but it
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:28.800]  That this inertial lemon wrote an article that it was sort of
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:36.320]  I think we're saying that they're probably wrong that it's it's a good article
[1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.960]  I recommend eating it. It's where I started with
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:41.600]  Until I spoke to people that
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:44.160]  Had to make it it's a little bit more magic
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:50.080]  Than then they can probably get away with and maybe even like from your perspective as a developer more magic
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:53.120]  Then you would be comfortable them trying to get away with
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  well, so
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.480]  Ms. Lemon, I'm gonna I'm already forgetting last year inertial name inertial lemon
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:06.240]  I that's where I started. I thought that was
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:13.600]  They seem excited about the possibilities and it is it's exciting that you could retarget an application to a different platform
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.520]  On the other hand if somebody retargets my code to different platform
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:23.280]  and I don't get to approve it and it's shipped under my name
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:26.800]  I'm gonna feel very uncomfortable with that now
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.920]  Turns out that's not what they're doing
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:34.640]  They're they're they're doing small optimizations that they can have
[1:02:37.280 --> 1:02:39.280]  Probably pretty small benefits
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:42.480]  but in under certain certain conditions
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:47.720]  They're they're certainly worth doing so I'm you know, I'm excited about that
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:51.040]  What next so
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:55.360]  And this was cool to me and just as somebody who you know
[1:02:56.160 --> 1:03:02.800]  Majorting computer science used to think about computer science. It's like a purely computer science-y type thing is Apple unveiled a new
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:07.040]  Compression algorithm. They're calling
[1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:13.040]  L Z F S E almost surprised me cuz Apple usually comes up with some kind of name for everything
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:18.560]  Yeah, but this is some hardcore. Yeah, and it's a replacement for
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:22.320]  Well, like sort of a drop-in replacement for
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:29.760]  What was Z Lib or whatever, but that it's it? It's got different. I mean, I don't know if replacement
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:34.240]  We're thing right cuz it's an alternative. It's an alternative. Yeah, right. Yeah, I'll turn it up
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:37.360]  Yeah, cuz they should like speed versus a compression factor
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.880]  And it's it's way faster than Z Lib
[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:44.240]  in the talk correctly and
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:47.920]  Compresses better too, right? So yeah
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:53.600]  And but the only thing that they didn't unveil about this they didn't say anything about it being open-sourced
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.640]  And I'm guessing that they probably will but they just didn't want to say anything right now because they're not
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.640]  They're not ready, but who knows
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:08.400]  Well, like you said, I think this is like serious comp side nerd territory. Yeah, if they don't open-sourced it
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.120]  I think there's gonna be a paper on it like he does. Yeah, it just seems to me like even if they've you know
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.400]  I can't see why they wouldn't open-sourced it
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:21.840]  I mean, the only thing I can think of is if there's some part of it that they've patented but even so it's like to me
[1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:23.840]  It would be better for Apple if they
[1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:29.200]  It would be more an Apple's interest to have this as widely used as possible assuming everything they say about it
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:35.600]  It is as good that it has the tight compression that you want, but it's like three times faster than Z Lib or whatever
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:40.720]  They wouldn't yeah, but you you can patent something and still describe the like right
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:46.720]  Like that's kind of the kind of the point right you can even uh like give if it exists like that for
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:49.520]  I mean
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.760]  You'd know better than I would like for
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:56.240]  20 years seems like before the patent expired. Yeah, the problem with
[1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:01.760]  Gift the Unisys on the patent on gift and it was like that they didn't enforce it
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:05.920]  They had a patent on it didn't enforce it then the web. Yeah, they did the submarine right
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:11.200]  And it was like all of a sudden on the web everybody was using it and then somebody at Unisys realized hey
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:13.200]  We own a patent on this and then you know
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.560]  Everybody sort of yeah, it was specifically if I
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:21.920]  Remember clearly the LCW yeah, I just very much in the family of things that we're talking
[1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.360]  I think what they could do an apple could do or some anybody could do
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:29.280]  And I think other people have done is you can patent it and say this is an apple patent
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:34.800]  But then they can they can bestow that patent, you know, they can say this is open to the world and you know and lee
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:40.400]  Yeah, once you have the patent you're the boss you can do it, but they could like like you can license it freely
[1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:46.800]  Right in it you didn't know legally binding you determine the licensing terms. So you know if
[1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:53.520]  The terms are everybody can use it and everybody can use it. That's fine, but I don't see that this is not a
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:06:00.960]  This is not a major benefit to apple. This is not gonna it. It'd be more of a better than your iPhones is gonna sell zero more
[1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:05.680]  It would be more of a benefit to apple if everybody else started using it even you know
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:12.160]  So like google servers were using it Amazon servers were using it or other you know startups
[1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:18.160]  You know people with web services could deploy it anywhere from anywhere so that iPhones
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:26.560]  Receiving these you know this stuff over the air could take advantage of this and have tighter compression and you know less CPU intensive
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:33.200]  Decompression of the compressed up and one one thing they pointed out was that
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:38.880]  A lot of the compression algorithms that we use today were developed 20 30 years ago and
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:41.520]  CPUs looked very different back right
[1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:46.400]  So creating a modern one that takes full advantage of you know modern
[1:06:48.560 --> 1:06:51.360]  Instruction sets and the ability to work on a lot of data with
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.440]  uh
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:07:00.880]  Man we're getting into the nerd weeds on this one, but there's methods to work with a lot of data with very few
[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:05.280]  Instructions and and the CPU can just optimize that. Yeah. Well, I you know
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:09.040]  We don't have to say much more about it, but I do say I still think it's an interesting thing to be coming out of
[1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:13.920]  I'm not surprised, but it's it's an interesting just pure computer science wind to come out of apple
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:18.240]  Yeah, one thing I did want to mention about this is what I mentioned to you while we were
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:21.280]  Kind of chatting about this before the show
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.520]  I see FaceTime as the open source exception rather than well
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:29.280]  They're they're really pretty good about releasing stuff that they said they're gonna be able to yeah
[1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:35.520]  But if people remember that though the fan infamous one day when they unveiled FaceTime and and Steve Jobs said and it's gonna
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:39.600]  Be open, you know an industry standard. We're gonna you know, we're gonna tomorrow morning
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:44.320]  We're gonna send this to all the industry standard, you know, the standard committees and blah, blah, blah
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:49.840]  And so whenever Apple says anything's gonna be open people are like, yeah, I'll still hold my breath on FaceTime
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.640]  But FaceTime is definitely the exception, you know, yeah, and I've said this before but
[1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:58.080]  I'll say it on your show
[1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.080]  I went out
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.240]  To a party with the FaceTime guys the day it was announced and they had no idea
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:11.080]  They were like what the fuck happened there. We don't know and I've since heard from people that would know
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:13.760]  that
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:15.760]  Steve asked somebody
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:22.440]  Can be open sources and they just came back with sure and they didn't really check with the team
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:28.760]  I like whoever gave the answer wasn't from engineer. Yeah, like the manager and the entire team was sitting in the audience
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:34.680]  And they were like when they heard they was gonna be open source day they were as shocked as we were probably more so
[1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:41.160]  So anyway, yeah, and plus in the internal everybody but it's not that's not some kind of weird
[1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:43.640]  Maccabillion thing that's just a complete
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:48.440]  Fuck up for like a better expression and it's sort of you know, it's
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:52.920]  You know, you got to take the good with the bad with Steve jobs where he can be
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:55.160]  impetuous and impulsive and
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.960]  Sometimes that works to your advantage and sometimes it doesn't
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:01.720]  Right, I get the impression that it was just like sure Steve
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.200]  And they had all sorts of other problems with that too where they had like a patent lawsuit and and there was a time
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:09.720]  I think I might be
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.320]  Yada Yada yada yada eating some of stuff in the middle, but some of this there were problems
[1:09:13.560 --> 1:09:17.000]  You know from when FaceTime debuted to where we are today
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.760]  where because of a patent lawsuit they had to unroll some stuff and
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.800]  It made it let work less well and there were some you know drop calls and stuff like that
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:31.560]  It got worse for a while before it got better because they had to take out some stuff because of a patent lawsuit obviously
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:37.760]  That would have been a problem if they'd opened if they had just just quote-unquote open source the original thing anyway
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:42.560]  Yeah, you don't just decide to open source something like that. There's
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:46.560]  technical and
[1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:50.320]  All right, so next big topic. We've got watch kit 2.0
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.760]  Which is seriously a major major major difference?
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:56.640]  So watch kit as we know it with what they unveiled last November
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:00.800]  What every single watch app in the App Store today is
[1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:08.000]  Is code that runs on your phone and projects a UI onto the watch
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:14.080]  And watch kit 2.0 as promised by Jeff Williams a month or so ago
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:17.920]  Is native native native code that can run on on the watch
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:27.600]  1.0 still works, which is nice and might be good for some uses, you know
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:32.520]  I asked yeah, sure about that last week and there might be some apps that don't even need to run natively
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.960]  If they you know really do just need occasional status updates why even bother with it?
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:41.560]  So I do think that the watch kit was sort of the
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.200]  That was the big thing right like we've got a whole new platform. Yeah, I think so
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:51.480]  What I was surprised about
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:11:01.320]  Was just exactly how much access we got to it because we get we all expected apps, right?
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:06.840]  But we get a lot more we get complications notifications glances and apps
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.880]  I really did not think that
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:10.840]  uh
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:14.360]  We as third-party developers would be afforded
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  Access to the complications machinery
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.160]  I always expected that we would be eventually, but I thought that would be an exterior thing
[1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:25.160]  Well eventually sure but as like a
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:31.480]  I know it's called a watch kid 2.0, but whatever I'm gonna call it like a first release of native
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:36.200]  Yeah, I Apple would never use a version number like this, but more or less like what we had
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:40.920]  With the current, you know watch kit is sort of like watch kit 0.1
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.000]  I'm surprised that they call it watch kit still
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  uh
[1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:50.440]  It seems like watch kit could have been that weird bluetooth thing and then
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:54.920]  I don't know watch SDK could have been
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:01.160]  I don't know, but here's the interesting thing you still need to have an iPhone app
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:06.840]  In order to have a watch app you cannot sell watch apps directly they need to be a complement
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.480]  to your iPhone app
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:13.320]  What that means is you know probably lost to the muddy
[1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:18.680]  Vegas or app approval like can you just have a screen that comes up and say hey check it watch
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:21.960]  probably not
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.160]  but
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:27.400]  What watch kit 2.0 it is is
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Remarkably robust
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:33.880]  and forward-looking
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:38.120]  Especially compared to how we saw the launch of yeah, I want to my
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:45.240]  Go-to moves during WWDC is when I run into somebody. I haven't seen them in all somebody. I know it's just asked them, you know and
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:49.400]  Especially this week. I just had last week. I had you know while I was there
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.400]  I had more meetings and stuff outside
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:57.480]  Moscone than usual almost every day. I had something going on and I really I didn't make it to any sessions at all
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:12:58.600]  All week long
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:01.960]  So I was woefully under informed even compared to usual
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:06.040]  So I just asked people like tell me something cool you learned this week and you know what what's your take?
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:10.680]  And I kept hearing over and over from people that who were surprised who were like I knew they were going to
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:14.120]  That they said we're going to get native watch apps. I can't believe how
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.040]  How much they've exposed to watch apps already, you know
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:24.760]  Even knowing that we're going to have something quote-unquote native running on the app people are you know developers are very surprised at how much there is
[1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:28.200]  I'm shot
[1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:31.800]  You know not to
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:41.400]  Whatever not to be too nasty you but I did like that. You brought up the watchcate 1.0 period to fill
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:47.080]  I'm calling him fill his days to to killing you to give me all that compliments, isn't it?
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:52.520]  Yeah, it really is I mean usually have me on the show and I like you want me to be a dick
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.800]  It's like like when we disagree with something you want me to
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:14:00.600]  It's I I you did a guy checks that I texted down rumple today
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:06.040]  We were I forget what we were texting about, but I told him that it killed me to admit publicly. How good he looks
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.720]  I was almost a faithful thing. I've written on daring fireball all year
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:17.000]  It's a good looking fellow these days. I don't want to mess with him. No, I
[1:14:17.320 --> 1:14:24.520]  Don't want we got to buy him a lot more beer and so here's an interesting thing so complications everybody is excited that there's a really good
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:34.360]  Complications API and that third-party apps can add complications to all these faces. It is a fascinating design challenge
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:37.080]  I was talking to the guys
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:41.400]  My friends who work at MLB.com and they do the MLB app and
[1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:45.240]  They were like they heard about this. They were they were just like us
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:51.000]  They were surprised that they were gonna get it and then they immediately started plotting what they were gonna do and for most of these
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:57.560]  Complications you're so limited in space and how much size it's like like their first thought was that you could pick a favorite team
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:01.800]  And then you'd have a complication that while the game is going on would show you the score
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:08.360]  But they for most of the sizes of complications. They there's I don't maybe they figured it out by now
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:15.080]  But at least last week they still hadn't figured out how to do it because you can't use color because the colors come from the
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:24.440]  The settings. Yeah, so you can't like say the Yankees are blue and the Phillies are red and indicated with dots that way or something like that
[1:15:24.440 --> 1:15:31.400]  You have to has to be without using color to indicate that and they're so little space that you you know
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:37.320]  It's it's really it's gonna be a great design challenge in terms of like constraints being you know
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:41.320]  Fourcing you to be super creative
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:48.280]  Yeah, I agree. I'm just as a bit of backstory
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:56.840]  I know you bring up the MLB guys a lot, but it's not just you'd love to baseball those guys do an amazing job
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:03.480]  Like we've had lunch, but I mean I've joined you for lunch a couple of you don't even know the rules are based on you have a
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:04.480]  I don't know the rules
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:11.040]  You have a good time guys are talking to those guys awesome to talk to you. They are amazing to talk to like it's like they are very
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:16.040]  very smart guys, and they all love baseball and they're not jackasses when I'm like
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:19.080]  So do you swing the bat this way?
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:24.200]  Batty in a thousand is that that's a hundred percent right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm asking about it
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.440]  But they are killing it in terms of technology
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:37.440]  Like you're killing it. I think I'm correct in that they're back-end is the one that's powering a bunch of
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:43.520]  Yeah, their video back-end does all of the WWE stuff and the HBO now
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:47.560]  They're not doing HBO go HBO go is still the old HBO back-end
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:53.400]  But new stuff is yeah, and I think it a I think the new stuff is probably more popular
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:59.960]  Yeah, and I mean just wrap your head around that MLB is a major
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:07.120]  Technology that's crazy. Well think about this like they deserve it because those guys are smart right and last year with HBO
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:08.160]  Go
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:15.280]  When Game of Thrones the you know last year season of game of thrones came out their servers crapped out and they had to say stuff like
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.320]  We know it Sunday night and there's a new episode of Game of Thrones if you want to watch it on game on HBO go
[1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:24.320]  Why don't you wait a day or two?
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:29.360]  And there was none of that this year with the HBO now
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:32.360]  And it's like one of those things people just you know
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:39.680]  When when you're online stuff fails everybody talks about it and when it works perfectly everybody just assumes that it was supposed to be
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:41.680]  But they the MLB
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:47.200]  dot com back to HBO now stuff with Game of Thrones just just worked and everybody if you wanted to watch
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:49.200]  Yeah, you know you could watch Sunday night
[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:54.880]  Anyway, just wanted to step out a bit there and sing their praises because those guys are not dummies
[1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:57.800]  But you know
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:00.200]  Complications on the watch seem perfect for that
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:04.320]  I don't yeah, I can't even tell you how many times have been hanging out with you and you just like
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.680]  Just dodged the conversation
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:09.920]  Not to check out what's going on with the game
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.760]  That'd be great
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:17.680]  And the way complications work is pretty cool and that you provide a timeline right
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:22.000]  obviously that's not gonna work for a game because again particularly future but
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  for you know
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Stuff like weather or upcoming events. You can provide a timeline and then when you start dying the digital crown you get to see into the future
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:38.720]  I haven't tried the beta cuz I don't want to put on my regular watch
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:42.880]  You still have your
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:50.080]  Yeah, the review you know watch I thought about that I do I was getting ready to send it back and now I'm wondering why that maybe I should keep it a couple
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:56.160]  Weeks so I can put 2.0 on it. Yeah, but two. No, really that's going in the garbage van that they're gonna insinuate that
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:58.480]  Because I wore it
[1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:00.480]  Yeah, probably
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:02.480]  They don't want that
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:06.240]  Somebody plastic gloves is gonna put that in the zip-like bag and it's going
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:09.960]  I think like a lot of people while I was watching the keynote and they said okay
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:16.400]  And now we've got this timeline interface for complications and you spin the digital crown that go forward or backward in time
[1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:19.440]  And it'll show you you know like so if you have the temperature
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.000]  Obviously they're not gonna be able to show you the future temperature, but you can go back in time and and
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:27.840]  See the previous temperature or the joke that they made that the stock
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:32.040]  You know, right this talk. It does not go into the future
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:35.520]  But you can go into the past and see the stock moving throughout the day as the hours
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:39.920]  You know change on your on your hand. I like I'm sure a lot of people
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:45.640]  I immediately thought well what the hell happens now when I spin the crown on my watch and I went and spun the crown and of course nothing happens
[1:19:45.640 --> 1:19:55.320]  Well, it depends on the astronomy and I believe the Sun. Yeah, the solar one. Yeah, you can do that
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:20:01.800]  You can spin the the thing and it shows you what happens, but that those are two faces where you don't get to customize the complications
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:08.520]  Right, and it makes me wonder maybe because that might be why you didn't get to customize the complications
[1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:11.480]  because they didn't want to have
[1:20:11.480 --> 1:20:13.480]  I
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:18.760]  Had that I didn't yeah, so it makes me wonder whether in the you know
[1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:24.160]  2.0 what maybe they'll add some minor complications to like the solar face because
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:28.240]  Those will update too as you spin the crown
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:31.960]  Well, we'll have to ask your friends. Yeah, we'll have to see
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:36.320]  But I thought that was pretty cool. I think that's pretty cool use and in hindsight
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:39.320]  It seems pretty obvious that that was gonna come to everything
[1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:44.760]  I feel like I should have been able to predict that because why else is that you know, why should spinning the crown be a no-op?
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.480]  Yeah, I also had a dummy moment there was like well, of course
[1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:55.880]  Well, I mean they killed it. I think that's a great
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:03.160]  Just seeing what you when you're next you I you I when your next counter appointment is a major
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:14.840]  Yeah, and not only that there's the tactile field of is it coming soon in that you move the digital crown very little or is it a while where you have to
[1:21:15.400 --> 1:21:16.840]  spin it a bit
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:18.840]  You know, I mean there's a
[1:21:19.320 --> 1:21:23.880]  It's like scrolling to the top of the page versus like scrolling a couple of lines up
[1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:28.440]  You have a note in here. It says foreground discouraged background preferred. What does that mean? Oh?
[1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:32.760]  Oh, this is something dress it to me
[1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:36.360]  When we were doing a like a debug
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:39.480]  W w dc to
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:42.120]  recap
[1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:45.400]  Originally on the phone
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:48.680]  You could not do anything in the background
[1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:53.640]  When your app was not on screen you were
[1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:58.040]  Dead to the world you you weren't running you expected to launch quickly and
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:04.280]  Get back to what you were doing, but you weren't running and then when you either hit the home button to go to another app
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:09.880]  You had like a second or two where the CPU would let you clean up and then once that time was over
[1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:14.120]  You were you're cut off whether you were done cleaning up. Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:17.480]  Yeah, the OS is like here you're done and it it
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:25.320]  One of the things I love about iOS is that it is not afraid to just kill processes like
[1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:31.960]  It'll tell you you've got to clean up and we'll kill you right? Where is the the classic Unix mindset?
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:37.640]  The true Unix mindset is to go to extraordinary lengths to keep all processes running
[1:22:37.640 --> 1:22:47.400]  Like the whole system can be out of RAM and it'll it'll start swapping and going to using the disk and swapping memory out to
[1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:52.600]  To extraordinary lengths to the to the length where it'll really slow everything to a crawl
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:58.360]  But technically everything is still running and iOS it'll spend like half an hour trying to figure this out
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:00.920]  How to get some swap space for you, but yeah
[1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:05.640]  The Mac does that down if you try running low and disk based bad things will happen
[1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:11.640]  Uh, but iOS. No, they'll just kill you. All right, so I you know
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:17.720]  And so you're saying that the or drances observation is that the watch is different where it actually prefers that you do stuff in the background
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:24.200]  Well in the it's not that processes are necessarily running in the background, but in that you
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:29.000]  Schedule a bunch of complication
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:35.240]  Advanced provide them to the API and then go away
[1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:41.320]  Uh, so as you turn in that dial your process is not involved in
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.280]  Telling the watch what comes next
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:49.960]  If you've given it 20 or 50 or 100 events in advance
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:52.840]  Um
[1:23:52.840 --> 1:23:57.240]  When the when the time travel dial when the digital crown is is turned
[1:23:57.240 --> 1:23:59.240]  Uh
[1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:01.880]  Your application will never be woken up
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:06.200]  All of the information that is required to present that
[1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:13.560]  Uh, your data on screen has already been given to the app and it won't bother you
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:18.200]  Um, so in a way it's more like you provide data
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:25.560]  And times to the to the watch and it decides what to do with them
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:31.000]  Rather than the phone, which originally had a very immediate
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:33.880]  Sort of interaction model
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:39.640]  Does that make sense? I'm sure Matt can explain it better. Oh, I do think so
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:45.800]  I know what you mean though. It's like you're supposed to to keep your complication going you just schedule like and you know
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  Obviously it could be abused
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:51.880]  Well, I mean, so here's the difference is like
[1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.880]  you and I try to schedule this show and
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:02.760]  You keep asking me like hey if you now hey if you now hey if you now if you know or I'm like look
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.800]  These are the box of time. I'm not free and this is what I am free
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:12.280]  And you can go away and work with that information and work it around your schedule and then come back with like well, okay, here's a
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:17.080]  Here's the time it works for both of us. Yeah, right like the
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:23.960]  That's kind of what the complications on the watch are doing and that you provide them with a timeline of events and data
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:29.800]  Rather than the watch asking you persistently
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:36.840]  So you as the application asking the application persistently to provide new information
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:44.760]  It asks the application upfront for the list of events and time and there's this new
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:47.560]  They call it a high priority notification
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.400]  Where if it comes into your phone and you mark it as high priority it'll go to the watch right away and
[1:25:54.200 --> 1:25:58.920]  I was thinking that's perfect for something like a sports app like the MLB app with the scores
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:02.360]  Like if you say I want to have scores on my watch, you know for the Yankees
[1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:05.640]  It can be it seems to me like it can be really smart
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:09.560]  And it knows well the game hasn't even started yet the game doesn't start till seven o'clock at night
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:13.240]  So we'll just all you need to know is that there's a game starting at seven o'clock
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:17.480]  And then the complication can just say something, you know, 7 o 5 p.m
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:20.600]  Miami Marlins, that's who the Yankees are playing tonight
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:24.440]  And then once the game starts they can just wait for the
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:30.520]  Every time the score changes send a high priority notification and then the watch would be up to date
[1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:35.160]  Pretty much as soon as the notification hits your iPhone and it doesn't need to pull on a regular basis
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:41.320]  It can just wait for this, you know for there a you know the watch or the phone app to get those notifications
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  That'll only happen when the score changes
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.400]  Right, and so two things here first
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:53.240]  notifications no longer need to be entirely presented to the user they can just go to the
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.040]  right
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:27:01.400]  Second, I love that you think that a Yankees score changes the high priority notification
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:02.760]  Well, this is another way
[1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:04.760]  See this is where it pays to be a fan of
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:06.040]  Soccer
[1:27:06.040 --> 1:27:08.040]  Because then you only have to get one note
[1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.640]  You only have to get one notification per game since they all end 1-0
[1:27:12.920 --> 1:27:14.920]  That's true. Can I give it that
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:22.280]  Okay, let's get man. I cloud kid. I cloud web service. That's kind of pretty surprising to me
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:25.320]  So the gist of the gist of that seems to be I didn't see the session
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:29.720]  But I only saw the highlight of it in that the state of the union
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:34.600]  But that now they're going to have a set of APIs so that a web app can use iCloud for
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:42.120]  User ID and pretty much get the same data out of it that that the native apps can
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:46.600]  Yeah, that is kind of remarkable
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:52.760]  Again, I haven't looked into it that much because web stuff is not my forte
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:28:00.600]  It seemed from the slide and what they said that you could use it for authentication
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:02.600]  Would you guys a
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:06.360]  Cube branch have used it for best bit of login?
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:12.200]  I know and I don't probably I mean it would have ruled this I think I'm blowing anything because we kind of
[1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:18.040]  That's if I'm not wrong that came up in like the beta glass note and you considered Twitter and Facebook
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:23.960]  Science right and the reason we turn those that cool to say it because how you can say that we thought about it
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:26.840]  I don't know if I've talked about this public or not, but there's nothing secret about it
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:31.240]  We definitely thought about it because we didn't want to write our own
[1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:37.000]  Authentication system because it's every moment that we spent writing an authentication system was a moment
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.480]  We weren't writing cool features that were specific to Vesper
[1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:43.960]  But the problem we found when we asked friends and family normal people
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:49.720]  And not not like people who are developers and know hey
[1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:54.440]  Yeah, writing your own authentication system is a pain in the ass is that a lot of normal people
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:29:01.000]  Really hate signing in with Twitter or Facebook because like let's say they they just want to use a note tap
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:05.000]  And they think and I think reasonably so they think hey
[1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:09.800]  I don't want to use my Facebook because I don't want my Facebook getting messed up with these notes
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:14.680]  I don't want Facebook posting something from my notes. I don't want I just want to keep them separate people
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:21.080]  Don't really understand where one thing blurs with another, but they they know if they never even sign into this
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:25.640]  Notes app with Facebook then they can never get intertwined
[1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:30.920]  And people are just uncomfortable people don't like doing it people like having
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:36.120]  I know it sounds like it sounds counterintuitive because everybody knows it's a problem to have
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:40.920]  75 different user accounts that you're active using and you have you know
[1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:45.400]  You're supposed to use a different password with each one and so developers think oh
[1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:46.120]  I'll solve this
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:51.000]  We'll just use you know Facebook as your login and then you can just use the account you already know
[1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:57.160]  But the truth is that people are uncomfortable with that because they don't want Facebook getting mixed up with these other services
[1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:03.720]  You know what I've never signed in with the Facebook to anything. I still don't have a Facebook account
[1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:11.320]  Yeah, but I know I do just for the sake of like I worry about it when I use Twitter to sign into something else though
[1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:13.800]  Because I've I don't think I've ever gotten burned by this
[1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:17.320]  But I know there are stupid things where you can like sign in with Twitter
[1:30:17.320 --> 1:30:21.160]  And you're not really paying attention and then they automatically tweet to your account
[1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:24.920]  I'm using blah blah blah and you know, there's a oh
[1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:30.920]  John I've had that happen. You know hated it. I took apologize like publicly like oh, it was
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:38.680]  I've done it. Yeah, maybe and I think I think and I think the only reason I avoided that was that I was late to it
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:43.240]  And I had a bunch of friends who got burned by it and so I knew not yeah. Yeah
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.520]  But by and large I'd rather sign in with my Twitter account. I mean
[1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:52.920]  I very rarely use Facebook, but in theory
[1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:57.000]  That's got a lot of personal information on me Twitter is
[1:30:57.800 --> 1:31:02.120]  like 99 percent me being a jackass in public
[1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:07.560]  Like I realized that everything I put into Twitter is pretty much gonna be public
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:16.360]  DMs I expect to be private, but I mean honestly if that fail that wouldn't be that bad
[1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:25.240]  But if you're app required a Facebook login, I'd probably let me know do it because it's you but
[1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:32.280]  I would be reticent to do it if I know because I have no idea what that would mean. So even as a developer
[1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:37.720]  I don't know I have no idea and I don't know if that can change in the future either, right?
[1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:42.680]  So well anyway, I we might have been a lot more likely to use iCloud than
[1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:46.840]  Anything else and we even thought about ways to use iCloud in a way that you know
[1:31:48.200 --> 1:31:51.640]  Even if we weren't using iCloud for the data just using it as you know
[1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:56.360]  Authentication having a token or something like that and there's ways you could do that. I think having the web service API
[1:31:56.360 --> 1:32:01.320]  It certainly makes it more interesting and more likely that we would have used it or that we might in the future or something like that
[1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:04.280]  Yeah, I think that's a good step
[1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.960]  Do you want to just start telling you? Yeah, we can start but let me take a break
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:12.520]  I have two more sponsors. Thanks. Let me get I mean knock one out and here's it's our good friends at
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:20.360]  Hover they got you know hover hover is yeah, I just I just bought a domain for them three days ago. Well
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:22.360]  You could for you
[1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:29.560]  Hover goober sucks. That's the best way to register and manage
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.720]  Domain names in the world
[1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:35.960]  They take all the hassle and confusion out of registering and managing your domain names
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.440]  They give you easy use tools to manage them
[1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:44.440]  And you don't need to be like a DNS expert to do it anyone can do it they explain everything
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:50.120]  And you'll be really comfortable figuring out yourself their support team is always ready if you need a hand
[1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:54.600]  Takes five minutes from from finding the domain name
[1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:57.320]  Finding, you know, they have tools
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:02.400]  So if the one you want is taken they make really smart suggestions about how you can fill it in with you know
[1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:04.600]  Get maybe use a different top-level domain
[1:33:04.840 --> 1:33:09.040]  Maybe tweak the actual domain you're wanting slightly to get one that's available
[1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:15.200]  If you've ever registered domain names somewhere else hover is like the difference between night and day
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:21.400]  Most other domain name registrars. It's like going into the bad part of town and you feel like you got to keep your hand on your wallet
[1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:27.680]  You got to look, you know for check boxes where they're automatically upgrading you to stuff. They have to opt out of stuff
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  They they
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:33.680]  Charge you more they seem like they're charging you these great prices
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:36.840]  But if you want something like privacy for your personal information
[1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:42.960]  On the domain name registration, you have to pay extra all of that you get that for free with hover
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:46.120]  It's all built in and they have the most amazing thing
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:51.560]  I still think that still sounds too good to be true, but it's not is they call it valet transfer service
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:55.720]  It's free. It's built into the to the price of being a hover customer
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:34:00.520]  So you've got domain names you've already registered from years ago at other
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.080]  At other registrars you sign up for a hover
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:08.680]  You see for yourself that yes, this is the place. This is the best place for domain names that I've seen
[1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:13.360]  You think I wish all my old domains were here. Well use their free valet transfer service
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:17.920]  You get in contact with them you give them the information to go to your old registrars wherever you have the domains
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.040]  And they go and move them all to hover for you. They just go through all the hassles and
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:30.200]  As our friend Merlin man has said in his reads for hover on on shows
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:36.640]  A lot of these other registrars. They purposefully make it pretty hard to to move your domains
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:39.760]  It's sort of like calling up to cancel your cable service
[1:34:40.160 --> 1:34:44.640]  They don't they and hover knows all the tricks. They know everything they need to do to get that working
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:53.680]  So great interface great management tools great tools for registering no domains and free valet transfer service
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.480]  What more do you need to hear?
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:00.800]  Here's the deal. They have a special code just for listeners of the show. You get 10% off
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:06.640]  Your first purchase go to hover.com. Here's the code now. They do a per episode
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.960]  codes so they're code for today's show this show is
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:16.440]  El Capitan all one word close it up no space. El Capitan and
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:22.960]  They'll know you came from this episode of the show and you'll save money doing it. So my thanks to hover
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:24.960]  Great sponsor
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:28.520]  Yeah, that's a good also
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:34.720]  Please use that code because that means that they'll know that you like me more than Phil Shiller
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:40.040]  And that'll mean a lot. Oh man. What else do we have to tear through here?
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:47.400]  Swifties with two we got it. We got man. We like halfway down this right. So they say yes with two I
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:51.000]  Don't know do you want to set the stage for this one?
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:52.360]  I
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:58.400]  Think Swift is doing great. I think the fact that it's as popular as it is one year in is fantastic
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:04.040]  But almost nobody is using it yet. That's like their main language. It's just it's not reason
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:11.320]  Yeah, it's not it's not that's not a failure. It's just it's the side effect of Apple releasing it as early as they did to get feedback
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:17.080]  I agree. I think if Apple were a different company. This would be
[1:36:17.080 --> 1:36:24.840]  at the what they're now calling Swift 1.0 would have been Swift 0.X and Swift 2 would have been Swift 1.0
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:30.960]  Because I really think the difference but the difference is is that what you know this year Swift
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:34.560]  They're calling it 2.0 call it the real 1.0 if you want to is
[1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:40.440]  informed by a year's worth of feedback from actual developers and
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:46.640]  Yes, I mean when Swift 1 came or when Swift first came out. There were some bananas stuff there
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:54.200]  You could mutate arrays in ways that would make no sense according to the to what you would expect from Swift
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:36:57.080]  Like if you copied a
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:05.840]  B into array a and then changed something in a ring in array b. It would also be changed inside array a
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:07.840]  uh
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  Probably lost like
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:16.560]  20 million of your if you listen in there, but basically it would be like if you know
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:23.760]  Spooky action at a distance like you would you would you would change one thing in one place
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:29.280]  And it would affect something in some other place and that makes it really hard to reason about how programs work
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:33.120]  they fix that they've been improving the syntax and
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:39.280]  With 2.0. I really think that they've kind of turned a corner and I think it's definitely worth
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:42.240]  considering
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:49.040]  Adocting for new code. Yeah, the big one a big addition. This isn't this isn't something they had to like revisit
[1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:51.680]  It's something that they really didn't even talk about until
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:55.600]  Until now is error handling
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:03.360]  Right and it looks good to me. I mean, but my perspective on this is certainly a layman's perspective at this point
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:05.360]  But it looks good to me
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:08.560]  In terms, you know, it's what are they calling it try catch it's
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:16.560]  Well, yeah, it's do try and then branch but and you know what you being too humble
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:19.680]  Playgrounds have marked down. It's pretty cool
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:22.480]  Yeah, good on you man. Yes. Yeah
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.320]  No, I know you're laughing, but no, it's I'm blown away by that
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:32.320]  I never really thought that anything I wrote would would make it into apples developer tools. Oh, I'm sure not if you could
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:34.880]  No, definitely not
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:39.520]  Oh god, but the ideas are which is yeah, well, that's bad the ideas were the best part
[1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:44.960]  Yeah, so error handling you create a block and then you
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:49.520]  API's they can
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:56.000]  They've kindly it through that that can return an error was throw an error in in swift
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:38:59.200]  language
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.080]  You you put try and find them and then you can basically catch those errors and and process them accordingly
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:14.080]  I'm trying to come up with a with a way to describe this, but it's almost like if every
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:17.440]  Every time you tried something if something went wrong
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  you would
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:24.640]  Not follow the rest of the steps in the recipe instead you would just go to
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:32.080]  The the the case where you clean everything up and you you wiped out the kitchen and you just say like no it didn't work
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:35.920]  So they've made kind of a pretty nice way. I think
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:39.760]  Handling yeah, and some of them and I think I forget
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:42.240]  I'm stealing this from somebody when we were out there last week
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:47.680]  But somebody when we were I don't know hanging out at drinking in the park 55 or something somebody mentioned that
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:51.520]  Some of this stuff is not really for the compiler
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:56.720]  Some of it is like the syntax is really for the programmer to know hey
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.040]  You know LLVM can figure out could could figure out some of this without the syntax
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:06.800]  But the syntax is there so that when you're reading the code you the programmer are like oh this could throw an error
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:13.440]  I totally agree. I might not get to the next line like it's it's you know
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:17.200]  Here's this method called to open the document
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:23.040]  I might not get to the next line because I I can see right here that this might throw an error and the error
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:25.520]  Might be well the document isn't even there anymore or something
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:30.080]  You know you don't even know but it's gonna you know the flow is gonna change and then here's where it's gonna go
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:32.960]  If it throws an error and I can see where my you know
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:36.400]  You know, you know, what are the what do I do if something unexpected happens?
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Exactly
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.600]  Let's take you up open document example
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:47.200]  The compiler knows it opened document
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:50.080]  may
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  Return with an error may throw an error
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:55.920]  You don't need to put try in front of it to appease the compiler
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:40:58.720]  you could just say open document and
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:04.480]  The compiler would be totally happy being like oh that failed so I'm gonna go down here, but by
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:07.680]  Requiring the use of the keyword try
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:10.560]  You are
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:15.200]  forcing the programmer to reason about the way that the code flow may change
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:19.760]  so
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:25.120]  A lot I do one of the things it concerns me about Swift is that
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:33.200]  There's a lot of ornamentation decoration that is in order to appease the compiler or to present the compiler with better
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.520]  options
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:39.280]  In order to produce faster code rather than
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:42.480]  Preferring more readable code
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:47.920]  That said this this try construct. I think
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:55.920]  It favors the favors the programmer and more so favors the person that comes back and tries to understand that code
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.520]  Right, maybe you didn't write it in a first place or for me personally
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.600]  I need any code I've ever written six months later. It might as well have been written by somebody else
[1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:08.560]  Yeah, well, you wrote a letter that yeah, so
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:14.960]  That's awful. Well, that's what comments are for it. That's that to me is where yeah, and you know to be fair
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:18.080]  You've you've I've seen some of it and you've commented very well
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:20.880]  That's to me as the secret to to me the secret to programming
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:27.520]  Was to when I when the breakthrough for me was to realize that comments aren't for other people comments are for yourself in a few months
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:33.200]  Yeah, yeah, explain to my future self exactly what the hell you were thinking when you wrote this right
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:37.920]  Yeah, the Zen of programming is realized that you're not that smart just you know
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:42.000]  Realize that you're the dummy that you're looking down on right now and just
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.600]  Become comfortable. All right metal on the Mac
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:49.120]  Metal on the Mac
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:49.920]  Very cool
[1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:53.520]  So metal was introduced last year on iOS
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:56.400]  It had the advantage that
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:02.160]  The GPU and CPU were integrated on the same chip, and they shared the same memory
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:08.080]  On the Mac. That's not the case like the Mac Pro has a distinct
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:14.960]  Discrete graphics cards it here. I'm not gonna forget the partner, but
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:24.320]  Some Mac pros have that too. They've got the integrated graphics and then they can like wrap up to having discrete GPUs kick in
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:30.560]  So metal on the Mac brings a very low level approach of graphics programming
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:34.880]  From iOS
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:36.880]  to the Mac
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:41.840]  Direct X12 has been doing this ATI's mantle
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:48.960]  API has been doing this I think in the time in the picture
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:50.320]  I feel like there's a couple of factors
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:54.160]  I think one of them is that Apple it they're their custom silicon teams
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:00.880]  You know call it all you know Bob Man's felt stuff, but they're doing amazing graphic stuff on iOS on the Mac
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:04.720]  They're still doing you know, they're using ATI and what Nvidia
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:12.000]  Graphics cards that could shift at some point right they could start doing their own graphics chips for the Mac
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:14.800]  Maybe but
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:16.800]  Laying the ground
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:23.520]  Yeah, laying the groundwork now with metal would make that sort of transition a couple of years from now a lot easier
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:30.160]  If in a couple of years all anything graphic intensive of Mac is assumed to be written to metal
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:34.000]  So there's a hardware angle here
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:38.400]  All right, I could be wrong
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:42.240]  No, you know, I'm off and wrong. I'm over my head on this the other
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120]  The other thing and I
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:50.000]  I made the mistake last week be right, but here's the thing with OpenGL it runs on everything
[1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:57.840]  OpenGL ran on OS 2 Windows 16 Windows 32 SGI
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:59.840]  I
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:01.200]  It's
[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:05.760]  OpenGL if you want that kind of cross platform thing OpenGL's we do it
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:09.680]  interfaces like metal
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:11.920]  Metal and directives 12 are
[1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:18.640]  A new way of reasoning by the GPU originally the GPU used to be about
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:24.880]  You would submit some triangles you would set some state in order to you know
[1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:30.320]  Like this is the color you're going to draw this is the texture you're going to map onto these triangles
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:33.200]  And then you would put them on the screen
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.320]  These days the GPU has got so fast and so
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:48.640]  Capable of just tearing through huge amounts of data that the best way to address it is not in this piecemeal fashion
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:52.000]  But rather to basically write out a command stream
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.480]  and a command stream is
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:04.080]  I'm sure maybe the more technical people in your audience will disagree with me, but it's effectively a program
[1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:10.320]  There's no loops or if statements, but it's like it's it's a recipe of how to draw a scene
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:15.680]  And you feed that to the GPU and then the GPU will just tear through it and then produce the output
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:21.280]  And the interesting thing is that stuff like OpenGL
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:23.280]  was targeted at
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:30.160]  Rendering 3D scenes. It's you know, GL is graphics language. It's the open graphics language
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:34.320]  Tract X 3D similarly all about that
[1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.400]  Metal
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:42.720]  Is about leveraging the capabilities of this off-board
[1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:45.520]  Superparallel
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:48.400]  Compute device
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:53.360]  It happens that it's really good at rendering pixels and transforming 3D stuff
[1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:56.480]  but
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:02.320]  The math required to do 3D and to to shade the pixels and to make everything look pretty is
[1:47:02.880 --> 1:47:06.480]  Also the math they can be applied in any number of different ways
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:12.400]  It may not be graphics related. So open so metal
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:19.600]  It does what open GL does and it also does what open CL does
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:25.360]  Like a friend Chris Lucio does a lot of stuff in open CL with with Capo
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:32.880]  And I'll guss me over with a horn does a lot of stuff in on the Mac with the with open CL
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:36.640]  Metal presents the device as
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:41.520]  A massively parallel independent compute
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:44.160]  It gets down to the fact that
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:46.160]  Ultimately you could describe
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:52.160]  Computers in general as machines that do math really fast and in in recent years
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:48:02.240]  It's the GPUs not the CPUs that have gotten faster and faster and faster at that and that there's I actually so the CPUs are good at
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:04.240]  I
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:08.160]  Guess the
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:15.920]  The better it's switching on conditions like if you've done this than that it this then like they have a lower latency
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:20.400]  The GPUs are like the most data you can throw at them
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:25.520]  And just have them crunch on it in the same way without changing any logic
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:28.400]  the faster they go
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:33.120]  And optimizing for the two is
[1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:36.800]  Different not in terms of the programmer but in terms of the
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:42.320]  The CPU needs to be responsive and we'll wait and see the GPU
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:49.440]  Needs to basically I mean you give it play to stake and it's it's done in like two seconds
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:51.640]  It's not I made the mistake last week with Shiller about
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:56.520]  Emphasizing gaming and it's great for games, but it's definitely not and at one of the mistakes were in the regions
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:49:00.360]  I made the mistake as I hadn't seen the state of the union yet and in the state of the union
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:03.680]  I thought this was great. I thought they were a it was good two good demos
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.440]  But I thought it was really cool to see Adobe on stage, you know, they had a guy from the United States
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:11.640]  They showed this crazy complicated
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:14.640]  Illustrator
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:17.640]  document where you could zoom in live whereas
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.040]  Prior to and this is a version that's not shipping it because it's based on metal. It's on the Mac
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.440]  And you could zoom into this crazy detail and with metal
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:32.200]  They could do it in real time and instead of typing a new number in the zoom box and then waiting a second for it to re-render it
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:34.760]  That resolution you just zoom in on the fly and
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.680]  And then they showed video effects and after effects that previously rendered like you know a really slow frame rate
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:43.880]  And now they're rendering in real time it's a you know
[1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:47.000]  All sorts of things already rendered in real time and after effects
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:52.040]  But this was a totally plausible demo of something somebody might be doing that's gone from
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:56.440]  You know, you kind of get like a preview to now it goes in real time
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:59.080]  So it's a big win for graphics professionals, too
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:02.120]  I told you
[1:50:02.120 --> 1:50:05.640]  So there was a time there where Adobe was you know flashed
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.520]  Not great
[1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:13.880]  But Adobe has been long-time friend of Apple's going back to like the first lizard to the lizard writer
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:22.120]  And you know, I mean, you know Ken. What's his name? Did the watch guy? Oh, I don't mean Ken
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:28.200]  Forget a snake. I know you can't forget his name
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:35.160]  Can't forget his name. Yeah, I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce it in the original Irish, but yeah
[1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.160]  Um
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:41.240]  He wrote a penis being like yeah flashes for every whenever he came back
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:47.560]  Adobe and Apple have had a very very tight relationship for a long time
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:53.880]  And say what you will about Adobe from I don't know what like 98 to
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:58.120]  You think I can't you think I can't fair each kind of thing
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:04.520]  No, Ken fair is awesome. Oh, some other guy some other can yeah, he was an actor. He didn't they don't want to talk
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:06.520]  He ought to lay it up
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:18.440]  But yeah, Apple and Adobe have had a lot of long relationship and I'm so happy to sit and back on a stage because they should be they should be hanging out like the
[1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:29.840]  There's problems with the doely stuff, but the notion that I like that they're the creativity and an apple that they
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:36.560]  Yeah, I like that the relationship between Adobe and Apple is on the upswing like I feel like it bottomed out and instead of continuing to
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:42.160]  Deiterate it's obviously on the upswing and it's cool that they are working with Adobe well in advance
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:47.440]  You know certainly well, you know clearly if they've got the demos already working Adobe didn't have to wait until
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:54.560]  WWE see to find out about metal and it even ties in with my carbon 64 joke last week because
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  What whatever year that was? 2006 2007 when the bottom dropped out on carbon 64 where the year before
[1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:06.640]  Carbon was going to 64 bits and then the next year was I guess what no
[1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:09.920]  I know for a fact that Adobe found out about it when it was
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:14.800]  When it was announced to WWDC which is really probably the the
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:18.800]  Nader the bottoming out of the Adobe Apple relationship
[1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:27.680]  Well thoughts on flash might have been yeah, but I feel like that was that that was that's a specific team at Adobe
[1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:31.040]  Whereas the carbon 64 thing I think hit closer to
[1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:37.440]  To home, but maybe that's just my bias towards being you know being a long-time fan of their creative tools
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:42.400]  Yeah, right, but neither of them neither of them helped
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:47.600]  All right, let me take a one last break here and thank our do our last sponsor read
[1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:49.840]  and
[1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:56.720]  Shockingly surprisingly, it's our good friends at Squarespace long-time supporters of podcast in general
[1:52:56.720 --> 1:52:58.720]  But certainly a long-time supporter of this show
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:01.120]  You guys know
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:03.680]  Squarespace simple powerful beautiful websites
[1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:06.880]  It's a way to build your own website and
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:14.560]  Instead of rolling it all from the ground up and getting a web hosting account running code and figuring out and installing software and stuff like that
[1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:21.120]  It's a platform where you start with a website that works and you have templates to choose from and you can
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:26.400]  Customize these things through drag and drop right in your browser what you see really is what you get
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:28.720]  You don't have to go into a special editing mode
[1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:31.680]  You're just logged in and you want to add something to the sidebar
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:35.120]  You just add it to the sidebar you can see what it looks like if you don't like it
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:37.680]  You can move it to a different column or something like that
[1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:40.800]  All of these templates are all responsive
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:46.160]  So you don't have to do anything right out of the box your website already looks great on iPhones and other smart phones
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:48.960]  Right out of the box. You've got commerce
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:53.040]  So if you want to set up a store you don't have to install anything you don't have to upgrade your plan
[1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:56.640]  It's just something that you get right there. So you want to set up a store
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:00.080]  You want to do something like that right there in Squarespace
[1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:05.200]  You want to set up a podcast they've already got tools for that where you just upload you know
[1:54:05.200 --> 1:54:06.800]  They've got an audio player
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:10.640]  It rolls out your feed so that your podcast already has a feed everything like that
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:17.600]  All built in right from the start you can get a trial with no credit card required
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:21.040]  You just go there sign up start using it you get 30 days
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:24.480]  And you don't pay until your trial is up
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:26.960]  And here's a new thing they have right now
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:32.960]  I know you guys have heard me talk about Squarespace before this is brand new start your trial before June 30
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:43.200]  So you got about two weeks from when this shows gonna air and you get a free year of custom email and business tools when you sign up for
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:45.840]  Either their professional or business plan

[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:19.200]  We got to cut through the rest of this real quick. There's you can see why apples get you know one law
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:25.600]  Yeah, a little bit you know what I thought it was like yeah, nothing major happened
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:28.880]  All right, what do we know? What do we know about the name power out?
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:34.320]  Oh, this is for iPhone. Okay, so I found an iPhone. Here's the thing
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  I believe when you get to
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:41.280]  20% they prompt you and it said you want to enter low-power mode
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.640]  Uh, I had if I'm not mistaken mistaken Android phones
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:49.440]  I
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:51.440]  Don't know
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.960]  When I was curious about was why does the and this is kind of weird but
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:55:59.520]  uh
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:00.640]  I would
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.280]  Be curious to know how a phone felt if it just slowly got
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:08.720]  Less responsive as the power went down
[1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:15.520]  Here's what I know about low power so far. I know that it it turns off like the highest energy
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  highest performance
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:23.200]  Parts of the CPU so like an app that might be able to kick the the CPU into a higher year
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:26.240]  It no longer does that so it'll slow some things down like that
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:30.000]  Uh, it turns off background downloads for some apps
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:35.360]  Uh, so it won't unnecessarily do things that hit the network in the background until you need it
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:40.400]  Like it might switch your email from push to pull so you it'll only check email when you go there
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:47.440]  Uh, and it turns out this is one of the things when he said like when when Craig Federigi said that it pulls some levers and gears
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:49.440]  That you didn't even think we're there
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:53.440]  Um, and one of those is that it turns off some of the animations in the UI
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:58.640]  So that things are just does less and it looks less cool
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:00.480]  Cool things get turned off
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:04.960]  But that they can really stretch out the amount of time you get on that last 20% of the battery
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.040]  So here's but I think it's good. I think that's a good feature
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  uh
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:14.160]  I'm just curious about like
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:20.160]  Uh, how about when it gets below 33% you just start throttling all of this back automatically
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:22.800]  Um
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:24.800]  In that if you don't have a lot of power
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.840]  You device is tired
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.760]  It's not going to be animating all the time. We're not going to be downloading that much and
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:36.160]  I think that's understandable to user
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:38.880]  Is that crazy to think of?
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:42.160]  Yeah, like you where I see from your notes that you're calling it anthropomorphic
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:45.040]  But yeah, like your iPhone's tired and so it's slowed down, you know
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:50.400]  Like when you run out of energy that seems natural to me. Yeah, like as we run out of energy on this show
[1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:52.400]  We start making less and less sense
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:57:56.720]  And people who are listening totally understand
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:01.280]  Um, right so I'm curious. I mean, I don't even know if that was
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:05.840]  Sure, I don't know really it's just a funny thing. It's sort of like we were saying about
[1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:11.680]  Um, the the iOS turning the Unix model of app
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:18.320]  Lifespan on its head where Unix keeps processes alive until the process decides it wants to be dead
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:20.880]  Uh, or it wants to exit
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:27.760]  Uh, it is sort of similar to that where it's like the way computers have always worked is to always run as fast as you can at all times
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:31.600]  And then all of a sudden you're out of energy. You know if you're running on a battery. Well, that's it
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:38.400]  You know, we have to go whereas it's kind of interesting to think of a of a machine that gets tired
[1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:43.520]  And does last so that it can stay awake it to some you know be useful in some way longer
[1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:47.920]  I think so but on the other hand, I mean
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:53.120]  I mean if Jonas is playing a game, don't you want like
[1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:57.680]  Wouldn't he be pissed? I guess I don't know if all of a sudden he's dropping framerates
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:02.080]  This kid. I'll tell you what. There's one way to get this kid fired up. It's to drop below 60 from
[1:59:04.480 --> 1:59:06.480]  Well, you're definitely the daddy
[1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:11.440]  Good work on that. Oh, man. We're never gonna cover all this stuff. What about that?
[1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:18.240]  I got a dog burger. That's all right. What do you call when Joanna starting was on we had a dog pooping so
[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:26.080]  She's ever got it more sure you're never gonna be she tracks me up like having a dog poop mid show is
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:31.520]  I would say the two it's hard to highlight to the year so far number two
[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:37.920]  Having Phil Schiller is a guest and then number one was having Joanna Stern's dog poop mid show
[1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:40.560]  And even Phil Schiller can't beat that
[1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:50.000]  Don't make me top that cuz yeah, we don't we don't we don't do you do what about the deep linking into apps
[1:59:50.240 --> 1:59:53.120]  There's this cool thing and I've got Iowa's nine
[1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:57.520]  Running on my old 5s and I'm just starting to notice it
[1:59:57.520 --> 2:00:04.080]  But like and part of it like one example is like that safari is now available as a view controller within your app
[2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:08.880]  So like and the example that already works is if you click a link in mail
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:16.640]  Instead of switching to safari you get a slide over panel that is safari and so your bookmarks are there
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:20.640]  It's not just a web view. It's safari. It's a safari view
[2:00:20.640 --> 2:00:24.680]  But then you get this new like back button up in the menu
[2:00:24.680 --> 2:00:30.000]  or not the menu bar the saddest bar and then when you're done you just tap that and you're right back to where you were
[2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:36.960]  I think that's and it's a safari view controller is
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:39.360]  brilliant
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:41.360]  At you know, it's not
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:47.760]  Technically that far off from what we saw with extensions and presenting applications within other context
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:49.840]  but
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:52.720]  Man does that every of these awful lot of problems
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:57.120]  Like I mean what
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:02.960]  Can't even you know what I don't remember what happens in Vesper really clip it. I only have our own built-in web view
[2:01:03.920 --> 2:01:07.200]  That yeah, you know, I'd love to get rid of frankly right
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:15.200]  Right love to get rid why would you want to fight that well because it was better than switching to safari every time if you just wanted to type the link and then not
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:19.360]  I'd not totally and you know, I don't want to speak for Brent
[2:01:19.360 --> 2:01:20.560]  But
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:22.560]  Pretty sure he did not
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:29.280]  Definitely didn't you had another web view. Yeah. No, nobody thinks really so I think that that's what we're going to one of the things
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:34.800]  The follow-ups of this is we're going to see a lot of apps this year switch from their built-in web views to just relying on this once
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  They can or you know, they'll keep it around but only went for the people who have an upgraded iOS 9 yet
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:48.080]  Right, but you know down the road they can just get rid of it and thank God it should because
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  And I like the solution so far
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:58.080]  Of having that back button up in the status menu which solves the problem that the the hardware back button on Android
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:02.000]  Tries to solve, but which I always find just confuses the hell out of me
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:10.000]  Yeah, cuz the big difference is that with this iOS one it tells you exactly where you're going back to it says back to mail
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:17.600]  Right, and you'll see that for any app that in books that yeah, and it's open like there
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:24.720]  And their example is obviously that you know Twitter got invited to early access to this and so that you can have a twitter.com
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:26.320]  slash
[2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:35.480]  You know GTE slash tweet ID URL and instead of opening it as a web view Twitter can claim that domain and then open it right in the Twitter app and
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:40.200]  It's again, it's like a view controller, so it's not switching you to the app
[2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:47.200]  It's just showing you a Twitter view temporarily, and then you can hit back and you're right back to read in your email
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:51.280]  So one big change is that they are not
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:57.240]  Happy with HTTP and they want to move up to HTTP for everything
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:00.120]  for everything
[2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:02.120]  In fact, if you use their higher-level
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:04.680]  API's
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:08.600]  HTTP connections will basically be rejected
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  So we had to you know, we got a cert and
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:14.200]  for
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:18.920]  Age than distilled and we were doing just benign stuff like asking for
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:22.800]  Like a list of tutorial text, you know like nothing bad
[2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:26.200]  But whatever
[2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:29.960]  They're not wrong, so we moved go to it to HTTP as
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:36.360]  You can have exceptions like if you're writing a like you know like you said before like a Twitter client or
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:42.760]  Mark was overcast or like another podcasting app. You're going to need to connect to domains that
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:48.440]  Are not under control and you cannot assume that they have
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:52.760]  Security certificate
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:56.280]  That said
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:58.280]  That's a bit of a weird
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:01.320]  Kind of change because things just keep
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:08.280]  Breaking in weird places, but I do think it's a with skate to where the puck is going to be type of change like it
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:14.680]  Yeah, it's it you can smell it coming that pretty soon just playing HTTP is going to be considered gross
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:20.360]  Like the way FTP is compared to sftp or something like that even though it's not as personal, you know
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:26.840]  And I've got during fireball setup now to do HTTP at s for I think I think everything works
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.960]  But but I still don't link to that by default
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:35.560]  And I think I probably should and I think it's like the old time 90s web developer me who thinks well
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:38.440]  That's slow and if it isn't actually asking for
[2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:44.920]  Personal information of any sort you shouldn't you know, there's no reason to do that whereas I think in the modern day
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:50.040]  I think any modern web server can serve HTTP s like that's the least your problems performance wise
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:56.200]  Yeah, I mean even for static content like we I mean these days we do full disc
[2:04:56.200 --> 2:05:02.840]  Encryption like every block you'd be invited is getting encrypted on the way in and out and it's effectively free
[2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:04.920]  I
[2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.920]  Wouldn't worry about HTTP f
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:10.760]  I'm gonna start doing that because you know what I want to get your bullshit. Not somebody's
[2:05:11.400 --> 2:05:13.400]  third parties
[2:05:13.960 --> 2:05:17.960]  Another thing a just small little thing, but I one thing I noticed was that
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:30.040]  The way that all the groundwork Apple has laid for accessibility and and and the primary reason for that is to help people who need it people with low vision
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:32.520]  Accessibility features for that
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:34.280]  You know
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:40.360]  Whatever whatever the the problems you might have that you need accessibility. That's the primary reason to do it
[2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:44.360]  But all sorts of good things are falling out with that so ex code has a new
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:50.040]  You I debugging features where you can debug the user interface of your app
[2:05:50.040 --> 2:05:55.320]  Not just the logic of the app and it's all built on top of the accessibility features
[2:05:55.880 --> 2:06:02.680]  So it's two good things that come out of the same thing you make your act accessible and then ex code can debug the user interface
[2:06:04.920 --> 2:06:06.920]  So I'm so glad you bought this up because
[2:06:08.920 --> 2:06:13.160]  Whatever we skipped over like in the in the order of the notes that we've got we skipped over
[2:06:13.160 --> 2:06:18.680]  Accessibility is almost a miss no more
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:24.440]  The way that you set up accessibility is basically to present your application
[2:06:27.720 --> 2:06:30.840]  In such a way that is open to alternative interfaces
[2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.680]  The primary interface is obviously you I could or I could on the Mac
[2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:43.480]  But accessibility presents your interface in a way that it can be understood
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:46.440]  by people who are
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:49.880]  have
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:51.880]  site impediments or
[2:06:53.080 --> 2:06:55.080]  No other
[2:06:56.280 --> 2:07:03.560]  Disabilities people with like remote motor disabilities challenges or yeah, they you write motors disabilities like there's a lot of that too
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:10.280]  It exposes what the the applications intent rather than the visual interface which
[2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:17.400]  You know, we all pay a lot of attention to mostly because I believe like the the majority of us are
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:22.840]  Have some like a fair degree visual acumen
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:28.680]  But apples really gone another way on this and you know what they don't make money on this
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:30.760]  There's no way
[2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:35.240]  No, and you know, it's one of those things that Tim Cook has said they don't do it for the ROI
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:38.680]  But good things come out of it though, right like this
[2:07:39.400 --> 2:07:41.400]  I totally agree. Yeah, I am like
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.520]  I
[2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:46.680]  You know, you know our friend
[2:07:47.480 --> 2:07:50.920]  Doug Russell is a huge proponent of this kind of stuff
[2:07:52.040 --> 2:07:56.760]  I love it first of all the accessibility API. It makes you consider
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:00.840]  While your application is about more than
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:04.120]  laying out buttons or laying out, you know
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:08.120]  Sliders and table these and all that accessibility makes you reason about
[2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:15.320]  how you're exposing your data model and I think for that reason alone, it's it's worth considering
[2:08:15.960 --> 2:08:18.280]  The other thing that I really and
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  Just as an aside
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:27.240]  Apparently the the Heller Keller Helen Keller achievement of wood was
[2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:30.920]  Want to voice over this year
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:36.440]  I didn't see that but I I'm waiting. Yeah, it's on loop inside. It's so yeah
[2:08:37.640 --> 2:08:41.080]  But the other thing that I that I found fascinating was
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:50.200]  iOS has gone hard on adapting right to left. Yeah, that's the other big thing. I noticed and I'd note it. It's like if you set up
[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:57.320]  You're if you do this if you set up your layout the way Apple wants you to for like
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:00.600]  Your view controllers and for going into your hierarchy
[2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:09.400]  It it it sounds unbelievable to me, but it's like it it just works and so like for people using right to left languages
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:15.160]  Like Hebrew Hebrew and Arabic or obviously the two big ones that at least I know of
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:19.640]  Um, your whole app can go right to left
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:25.720]  And and right which is great, and I don't even know what proportion of the world
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:34.120]  I mean, so it's ever because he the big ones to them aware. Yeah, that's same here, but it's like it's mind-blowing to me and and
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:38.440]  I forget how you pronounce our last name, but it was Sara Radi
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:40.200]  Radi Radi Radi
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:45.400]  Yeah, who did the demo and it was like mind-blowing because it's like here's an app where it starts on the right and
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:52.120]  The back button is top right and you go further into the hierarchy by going to the left and it all
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:56.040]  You know, I hate you know sounds too good to be true, but all just works
[2:09:56.680 --> 2:09:59.240]  but yeah, they did not fund that in like the
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:06.760]  The pagination view where and I guess the best example is the whole screen the one that she used right is like
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:12.200]  Rather than going left to right to advance to pages. You go right to left
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:19.560]  That's brilliant and that's like a lot of work and
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:30.280]  I'm not I don't know I haven't timed it out, but her time on stage at the state of the union was certainly comparable to
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:32.840]  Josh and Eliza
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:35.800]  And this was for something like
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:41.800]  Eliza and Josh to watch it which everybody's like rabbit for and
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:46.360]  Sara Radi did
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:51.720]  Accessibility and user well, so she didn't do accessibility user interface layer from right to left
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:55.400]  And they meant they really hammered it home and I
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:11:01.720]  It's one of the remarkable remarkable things about Apple is that they
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:10.920]  I really think it's these kind of things that make me believe that they
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:15.960]  Of being honest when they said that they
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:23.400]  Hold these things dear to them. Yeah, is that the amount of minutes that they gave this talk
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:28.280]  The fact that they even bother developing it. Why would you?
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:31.400]  There's no reason. I'm sure that there's enough
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:36.840]  Bullshade phones out there or bullshit devices that don't bother to do the right to left thing
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:40.040]  But it's better and
[2:11:40.040 --> 2:11:43.640]  So yeah, it's funny because you know, I don't think of it as in
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:46.680]  Somebody who literally only speaks one language English
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:50.760]  But I don't think about the fact I like if I think about it
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:55.560]  I realize it makes sense but on a day-to-day basis. I don't think about the fact that the way that the hierarchies work
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:58.920]  Like just call them view in the finder or you know
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:02.760]  Which which is an old nextism that goes back to the 80s this sort of column view
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:05.640]  Which really really set the stage for the
[2:12:06.200 --> 2:12:11.000]  Billion it's the iPod half the future. I mean it's the iPhone at the but that column
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:16.200]  The reason we go left to right with that is because our language is left to right and that that's how we go
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:22.360]  Our eyes go left to right in that for right-to-left languages. It would make more sense for
[2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:26.120]  The the hierarchy of the interface to go right to left as well
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:29.080]  and programmatically
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:31.880]  It's honestly not
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:32.840]  difficult
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:36.360]  The other thing that they've you got to bend you mind a little bit but
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:42.840]  It's just yeah, the other thing I got out of that it part of it is that it's the right thing to do and like you said
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:50.840]  They didn't have to because I'm sure that people who who run their iPhones in Arabic are used to the fact that they're reading the
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:55.960]  Words right to left but they're navigating the interface left right that they're just used to that like yeah
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:00.600]  I'm left-handed. I've adapted to it to a world that is right-handed
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:04.680]  And I'm sure that people that we write to left naturally
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:08.360]  Just like well, it's good my phone works his way and that's fine
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:12.280]  But there's another there's another aspect of this that does have a practical upside for Apple
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:16.200]  And that's the fact that they're making it that they keep adding features to add
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:19.240]  Translations to your app in other languages
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:24.840]  As as easy as possible and as powerful as possible and they even emphasize now that only
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:27.480]  I might get the number wrong
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:31.080]  But somewhere around 30% of app downloads are in the United States right now
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:33.160]  And I'm not quite sure they didn't do it by language
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:40.840]  But if it only 30% of app downloads in the United States and a huge portion of them just just two countries alone China and Japan
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:45.960]  Together account for over 50% of app downloads. So
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:51.320]  If you want to you're leaving off a majority of the iOS
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:56.120]  User base if you don't have Chinese and Japanese translations of your app
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:00.440]  And obviously like you and I we you know, I can't translate
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.160]  Vespern to Chinese and you can't trust translate napkin into Japanese
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:09.720]  But there are services that we can commission to do these translations for us
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.720]  Here's a list of English strings. Please give us you know the Japanese and Chinese equivalents
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:16.120]  Apple is bending over backwards
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:20.920]  I think to make that possible and that's so that you don't have you know Chinese users
[2:14:20.920 --> 2:14:25.880]  Don't have to only use apps written by Chinese developers that they can get apps that are written you know
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:32.280]  For anybody anywhere in the world that just takes the step of getting a translator to translate the UI
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:38.200]  Yeah, I totally agree. Um, I didn't I didn't count them before the show
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.120]  Because that wasn't true. We'd need it, but I'm gonna guess it was
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:46.840]  Minimum two at least three or four sessions that addressed
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:49.160]  I
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:51.160]  Internationalization
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:56.120]  Like they're they're not kidding on this. I don't think we're done hearing about
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:00.520]  I think that's I think that's gonna be like a constant theme henceforth and and WWDC
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:03.560]  I should be because you know
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:10.600]  The world is a big place and pretending that the the US is the only place that matters is
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:13.560]  It's the only place that matters the most though
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:21.800]  Well, it's the only place that matters historically and that you can work out deals. No, seriously
[2:15:22.200 --> 2:15:25.000]  You know, I'm Canadian. I we're not gonna get new
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:28.440]  We didn't even get to that but
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:34.360]  Well, cuz you know, I mean, there's a lot of we have some restrictions on Canadian content and
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:39.800]  Quebec is predominantly francophone, so there's that hurdle that
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:42.200]  Um
[2:15:42.200 --> 2:15:45.800]  We know people who've worked in the iBooks side of things that
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:53.160]  Have had difficulty landing deals with Canada just goes back kind of thing so I understand it um
[2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:56.680]  Just to bring it back to making fun of you
[2:15:56.680 --> 2:15:58.680]  Uh
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:03.400]  How funny was it when they ran daring fireball on the news thing?
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:08.200]  I it was very funny and I was writing a note at the time
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:10.280]  So what happened was whenever
[2:16:10.280 --> 2:16:15.480]  We said Susan Prescott was unveiling news and she was saying you know in addition to like the New York Times and Wired
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:16.760]  Magazine and all these big brands
[2:16:16.760 --> 2:16:22.520]  She was like you could also read your favorite blogs like daring fireball and I was like heads down writing notes in my notebook
[2:16:22.520 --> 2:16:24.520]  And I was like wait
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:29.080]  And I look up the only thing and I had no idea the thing that made me mad about it
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:31.240]  My first thought was wow that's incredible
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:35.640]  I cannot believe that just happened and my second thought is I wish that they had told me in advance because I would have
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:39.720]  I would have given them a much better graphic for the logo like they made my logo
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:41.960]  They also opted you in with
[2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:44.920]  Like a don't worry he'll be in you
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:46.920]  Yeah, I think I guess I'm signing up
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:51.480]  We don't have time to talk about
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:54.120]  That to change it because you're a great looks shit. Yeah, the color
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:58.440]  I didn't mind that they changed the color because it doesn't look good projected what I don't like it's like
[2:16:59.080 --> 2:17:03.960]  I didn't like it that they made this circle with star and as big as could possibly fit in the space
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:07.480]  Whereas it should have been small and my example all week long as I've been
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:13.880]  Complaining about this incredibly great publicity that they give me is that if you look at the back of your iPhone
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:15.800]  How big is the apple on the back of the iPhone?
[2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:16.840]  It's small
[2:17:16.840 --> 2:17:21.960]  Well, that's how small the during fireball logo should have been in the overall rectangle that they give you
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:25.720]  On the news site whereas they made it like as big as it could possibly be to fit
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:31.960]  But that's a small you know what I've gone this entire show thing saying like nice things about you
[2:17:33.640 --> 2:17:39.480]  You know what when they show my logo in it they can make it whatever fucking says in the keynote, okay?
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:46.200]  Yeah, all right fair enough all right. I got to go. This has been great time
[2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:50.240]  Anyway, really appreciate let me thank our sponsors Harry's
