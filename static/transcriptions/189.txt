[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  So, how are you? It's been a while. I have a lot to cover because my last episode was
[00:06.560 --> 00:11.760]  the Lisa Jackson episode, so it wasn't really news-related. There's a lot on the agenda.
[00:11.760 --> 00:17.400]  I'm trying to think of even where to start. I guess we could start with quarterly results.
[00:17.400 --> 00:27.800]  I don't know. I just wrote a big piece about iPhone sales in China. I don't know. I don't
[00:27.800 --> 00:35.720]  think it's major. I don't think the quarterly results this time were all that bad or good.
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.080]  I think long story short, my take on them is that it was a pretty good quarter everywhere
[00:39.080 --> 00:45.040]  except China, and it was iPhone sales continuing to slide in China turned a pretty good quarter
[00:45.040 --> 00:51.480]  into an eh, okay quarter, where it was flat. Yeah, flat, I think, is a great word to describe
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.400]  it. There were two things that Tim Cook said that really stood out to me, and one was when
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.520]  they're talking about new customer acquisition that the rate of switchers from Android to
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.280]  iPhone was up everywhere when you discounted China, which is a different story than they
[01:04.280 --> 01:05.440]  used to tell.
[01:05.440 --> 01:13.700]  But that's a big but because part of what I wrote about today based on a very good column
[01:13.700 --> 01:20.120]  by a friend of the show, Ben Thompson, with some market research, at least two pieces
[01:20.120 --> 01:28.960]  of market research, one from China and another from UBS analysts that came out last year,
[01:28.960 --> 01:36.480]  show that in China, there's a lot lower retention rate, meaning when somebody who already owns
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.880]  an iPhone goes to buy a new phone, do they buy another iPhone or do they switch to another
[01:40.880 --> 01:46.400]  brand? That's retention rate. In the West, it's pretty consistently in the mid to high
[01:46.400 --> 01:53.200]  80s. In the U.S., in the U.K., in Germany, for two or three years now, it's very consistently
[01:53.200 --> 02:00.240]  84, 85. Germany is even a little higher, 88, 89. Japan is a little lower, like mid 70s,
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.480]  but pretty flat year to year. But in China, it went from Western levels in the 80s, like
[02:06.480 --> 02:12.440]  a couple years ago, to around 50% now, which is not good from Apple's perspective.
[02:12.440 --> 02:17.160]  No, that's a very different narrative than what they spoke about previously. If you flashback
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.800]  a couple of years when they were talking about the lack of low entry level pricing on iPhones,
[02:21.800 --> 02:24.640]  one of the things that Apple said is they didn't need to be your first phone if all
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.080]  you wanted was the cheapest phone. If cheapness was your primary feature, that was great,
[02:29.080 --> 02:31.900]  but it wasn't a feature they were competing on. And they would count on the fact that
[02:31.900 --> 02:35.320]  you would get into smartphones and then if you wanted a better phone experience, you'd
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.160]  upgrade to an iPhone. And a lot of people did that either for status or for iOS, for
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.360]  iOS apps, but that's no longer the case in China. There is still the status symbol implement,
[02:44.360 --> 02:49.520]  but as Ben pointed out, the platform layer has shifted from base operating system to
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.520]  messaging.
[02:50.520 --> 02:55.800]  Yeah, and especially, it's particularly this app, WeChat, which is I think only in China,
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.240]  I don't know, or at least it's really only a sensation in China, but it's truly staggering
[03:00.240 --> 03:06.520]  numbers. It's a four year old app from another company, but it's, I don't know, 900 million
[03:06.520 --> 03:12.880]  monthly active users, something like that. And I don't want to go too, I'll put a link,
[03:12.880 --> 03:19.880]  I swear to God, in the show notes, at least in my article, which has a link to the post
[03:19.880 --> 03:29.160]  from a woman named Connie Chen at Anderson Horowitz, explaining more or less for, you
[03:29.160 --> 03:34.240]  know, what is WeChat and why is it a sensation in China? And long story short, it's sort
[03:34.240 --> 03:42.680]  of like an OS in an app where it's a messaging app, but you can do so much stuff. You can
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.160]  pay for, it's like, you know, like an Apple Pay type competitor where you can go into
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.240]  a store and use WeChat to pay for the lunch while you're in line. And, you know, like
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.100]  Ben has said that in China, it makes you look like a rube if you pay with cash. Everybody
[03:57.100 --> 04:01.960]  else is paying with WeChat. It's just all sorts of stuff. You can buy stuff. It's a
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.400]  shopping app. It's, you know, that all sorts of companies that would like to be on the
[04:06.400 --> 04:13.200]  WeChat platform set up their own, like authorized accounts, like a special account status that
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.700]  opens up a bunch of APIs so you can have a programmatic backend so other WeChat users
[04:18.700 --> 04:26.280]  can, when they're chatting with, you know, Renee and John Incorporated, we can sell them
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.800]  t-shirts or sneakers or whatever right in the WeChat app.
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.040]  Yeah. And messaging is fragmented. So it doesn't really, like you don't have to own messaging
[04:35.040 --> 04:37.920]  everywhere. As long as you own the China market with WeChat, you're fine. The Japanese market
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.940]  with line, it's almost like people who are such casual computer users that all they ever
[04:41.940 --> 04:45.480]  use is Facebook. It makes no difference to them if they're on a Mac or a Windows PC or
[04:45.480 --> 04:49.360]  a library terminal or anything. Their entire computing experience is Facebook and it makes
[04:49.360 --> 04:50.360]  it easy to migrate.
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.360]  Right. My argument, and I've said this, you know, I've always thought this and I still,
[04:54.360 --> 05:00.760]  I believe it's always been true and always will be true, is that in the basic Apple's
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.500]  model is selling nice hardware differentiated by proprietary software. That's also nice.
[05:06.500 --> 05:13.360]  But the software part is more important than the hardware part because that's what makes
[05:13.360 --> 05:19.400]  people sticky to the platform. You know, and so like a Mac user, and I, you know, I've
[05:19.400 --> 05:23.520]  put this forth before. I think you would agree with me. I just love it as a thought experiment,
[05:23.520 --> 05:32.720]  but would you rather use Apple's OS on competing hard on some other hardware or would you rather
[05:32.720 --> 05:40.940]  use some other hardware platform that's running, wait, some other hardware platform running
[05:40.940 --> 05:45.280]  Apple's OS or would you rather use Apple's hardware running the other OS? So for example,
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.760]  would you rather have, like I would rather have a Google Pixel that runs iOS, hypothetically
[05:49.760 --> 05:55.400]  since that's not really possible, instead of say an iPhone 7 that's running Android?
[05:55.400 --> 05:59.280]  Totally. And I think it's easy to see because there are other companies that can manufacture
[05:59.280 --> 06:03.160]  beautiful hardware and they're in fact the suppliers of a lot of Apple's components.
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.000]  So we know they can make really good components, but no one else has proven they can make really
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.560]  good software yet. That's a much more rarer skill.
[06:09.560 --> 06:13.920]  Right. And with the iOS example, it's a real hypothetical because I don't even think it's
[06:13.920 --> 06:19.060]  possible. I really think that there's technical aspects of like the, you know, the secure
[06:19.060 --> 06:22.600]  enclave and stuff like that that would keep something from iMessage from working. Like
[06:22.600 --> 06:27.560]  in my hypothetical example, I'd have everything. You know, my iMessage would work. My iCloud
[06:27.560 --> 06:32.480]  ID would work on this Pixel running iOS, but I would rather have that even though I do
[06:32.480 --> 06:37.960]  in any abstract prefer an iPhone 7 over the Google Pixel, which is the latest Android
[06:37.960 --> 06:41.400]  phone that I'm most familiar with and which I have to say is actually, you know, the nicest
[06:41.400 --> 06:47.720]  Android phone I've ever, I ever saw versus the other way around. It would drive me nuts
[06:47.720 --> 06:51.440]  to use Qualcomm's crappy processors instead of the A series, but you can live with it.
[06:51.440 --> 06:55.760]  Yeah, I could live with it. It's, you know, it's fast enough. You know, I peg, you know,
[06:55.760 --> 06:59.960]  if you look at the specs, it's there like somewhere on 18 months to 24 months behind.
[06:59.960 --> 07:06.000]  I mean, I'd still, you know, I would rather use a two year old iPhone 6 than use, you
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.280]  know, cutting edge Android because the platform is most important to me. It's just my mind
[07:10.280 --> 07:16.800]  is warped around it. It's part of the way I think about how to do stuff on the phone.
[07:16.800 --> 07:20.360]  And whenever I pose that question, you know, and with computers, it's actually is possible
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.440]  because you could create, you can create a Hackintosh that works, although there's still
[07:24.440 --> 07:28.280]  as things like iMessage still, you know, has problems and stuff like that because there's
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.720]  security, you know, it's not perfect. Hackintoshes don't work perfectly, but they do work. I'd
[07:34.720 --> 07:41.600]  rather have a Hackintosh like on a ThinkPad running Mac OS X than anything, Windows, you
[07:41.600 --> 07:46.840]  name it, Chrome or whatever, whatever else, a desktop, a PC operating system I could have
[07:46.840 --> 07:48.800]  running on a MacBook.
[07:48.800 --> 07:50.440]  Yeah, absolutely the same.
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.200]  But I've heard, I know there are people that's probably listening to the show right now.
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.960]  I've heard from them whenever I bring this up because I do think it's an interesting
[07:55.960 --> 08:01.280]  hypothetical question. There are definitely people who I hear from who, you know, read
[08:01.280 --> 08:05.960]  my stuff or listen to the show and say, no, I, you know, used Windows forever, but switched
[08:05.960 --> 08:11.600]  to a MacBook just because of the hardware. And a lot of times they'll say like, and you
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.720]  know, not just the way it looks, but like I just got sick of the fact, like I wanted
[08:14.720 --> 08:20.000]  a laptop that just, when I opened it up, it turns on. When I close it, it shuts. It works.
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.960]  Trackpad works. Trackpad working is a huge thing. And I know Joanna Stern, friend of
[08:24.960 --> 08:32.200]  the show, is often, she's like the absolute queen of trackpad judgments. Like she's got
[08:32.200 --> 08:37.120]  the ranking in her head of every single trackpad quality in the whole market. And I totally
[08:37.120 --> 08:43.480]  trust her judgment on trackpad quality. That's a huge one. But the people who say that they
[08:43.480 --> 08:47.160]  switched like that a lot of times say, but that's the only reason. And that they're,
[08:47.160 --> 08:51.480]  you know, for example, very common scenario among my audience at least are like web developers
[08:51.480 --> 08:58.480]  whose entire life revolves around Chrome, a text editor and a terminal window. And any,
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.520]  you know, so somebody like that, if that's your life, if your life is just Google Chrome,
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.960]  a text editor and a terminal, you can easily switch to some other brand of laptop running
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.400]  another operating system, you know, because those things are available on every platform.
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.200]  Yeah, absolutely. Same as a Facebook example. It's just your entire environment is abstracted
[09:18.200 --> 09:22.200]  away from your computer. Right. Well, that's why I think Facebook is such a, not really
[09:22.200 --> 09:34.200]  a threat to Apple, but like a direct threat, but certainly looms large as an indirect threat.
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.480]  You know, like somebody like it's far more of a threat. Facebook is far more threatening
[09:38.480 --> 09:44.000]  to Apple than to me at least than say Samsung, even though you would think Samsung would
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.120]  be the one who's the threat because they do the same thing. They make $700 cell phones
[09:51.120 --> 09:57.360]  that when somebody goes into a store to decide what to buy, they're only going to buy one.
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.980]  Whereas I feel like Apple has, it successfully is in a, has always been, or at least has
[10:03.980 --> 10:08.800]  been for 20 years in a position where the quality of their products are enough that
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.800]  they don't really have to worry about somebody else who also sells nice things because they've
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.760]  got the software platform to differentiate themselves. The problem with something like
[10:17.760 --> 10:24.360]  Facebook is that Facebook in a way is sort of like the WeChat of the West where, you
[10:24.360 --> 10:30.400]  know, if it's the most used app and it, from a lot of people it is, and it does all
[10:30.400 --> 10:37.080]  the same things in mostly the same ways on iOS and Android, it's a lot easier for somebody
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.560]  to switch from an iPhone to Android if their most important app just works exactly the
[10:42.560 --> 10:46.720]  same way and lets them do all the same things. And it's interesting because the web arguably
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.640]  helped Apple at a time when they were very far behind in terms of just market share and
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.960]  mind share with PC, but the web let them compete. You could just have a web browser and you
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.920]  have access to all these things and it did ease the transition back to Mac. But it goes,
[11:01.920 --> 11:04.840]  that door goes both ways and it can let people leave as quickly as it let them in.
[11:04.840 --> 11:13.480]  Right. It was, that sort of cross platform parody that the web created was helpful to
[11:13.480 --> 11:20.040]  Apple when Apple was struggling, but it's detrimental to Apple now that Apple's in
[11:20.040 --> 11:23.120]  a position of strength. And it's interesting because there's different
[11:23.120 --> 11:26.200]  layers of abstraction where Facebook abstracts away a lot of the operating system and you're
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.840]  just interfacing. Because for a normal person, the interface is the app and the interface
[11:29.840 --> 11:32.760]  is the hardware. It's the face that they, literally the face that they see and they
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.480]  work with. And you can change all the plumbing behind it and they may not notice. But if
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.680]  you change one button on an interface, you'll get complaints or, you know, people will tell
[11:40.680 --> 11:45.400]  you about it. And there's voice now assistance too, where you use Siri for example, which
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.240]  totally disintermediates Google and all they see is queries coming from Apple and it's
[11:49.240 --> 11:53.760]  really regard, Apple could switch the plumbing for that. And then Alexa intermediates things
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.340]  and it's almost like this battle for who can be the final point of the user interface.
[11:57.340 --> 12:01.200]  And that's the experience that becomes sticky. Right. And you know, and Facebook is doing
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.720]  WeChat similar things, you know, with messenger and stuff where there's sort of apps within
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.720]  apps. And it's sort of the sort of, it's the sort of thing that Apple it's in its, in its
[12:10.720 --> 12:17.880]  way has tried to discourage in the app store all along. Right. Like they were never going
[12:17.880 --> 12:23.320]  to allow, say it's part of the whole flash thing in the early years when that was contentious
[12:23.320 --> 12:32.080]  and when Adobe first had a sort of flash to native iOS development chain and Apple like
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.240]  put the kibosh on it, it was sort of, you know, one, I'm sure there it's strategically,
[12:38.240 --> 12:41.440]  there were multiple reasons, but one of them was they were never going to allow something
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.920]  like an Adobe app that when you open the app gives you like a secondary homepage of flash
[12:46.920 --> 12:52.080]  based games that you can play. Right. You can't have an app store within the app store
[12:52.080 --> 12:59.880]  except that if you already have a certain momentum and size and importance like Facebook
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.080]  and like WeChat has in China, you can kind of get away from it, you know, get away with
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.840]  it because Apple can't really afford, they can't say we're not going to allow WeChat
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.040]  on the iPhone in China and they can't say we're not going to allow Facebook on the iPhone.
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.420]  Yeah. People would just buy something else at that point. Right. But so, you know, they
[13:18.420 --> 13:22.400]  even talk about apps like, you know, Facebook has things they call apps that you can have
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.340]  within messenger and like if you and I started a new chat app and came out with it and we
[13:28.340 --> 13:32.800]  said that there were apps you could have within the app, it would never, it would not make
[13:32.800 --> 13:41.280]  it through app approval in the iOS app store or probably wouldn't. It's just something
[13:41.280 --> 13:46.240]  that somebody, you know, a company like Facebook that has that sort of, what would you call
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.960]  it? Stature? Yeah. Well, it also blurs the web services line because like Apple wouldn't
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.600]  blink with just like you go to google.com and there's your Gmail and your Google calendar.
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.280]  Those are just normal web experiences and they've done that, but they've packaged
[13:57.280 --> 14:01.320]  those things up inside chat clients or inside social networks instead of having them as
[14:01.320 --> 14:04.920]  a bunch of standalone URLs and that gives a very different experience and probably a
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.240]  lot more compelling experience. Right. And you know, one of the ways that Facebook is
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.840]  sort of threatening to Apple is in theory, like I don't think this would happen. I think
[14:13.840 --> 14:18.240]  it's, you know, so far it's actually more likely the other way around where something
[14:18.240 --> 14:24.160]  like, you know, Facebook's subsidiary Instagram was iOS only for years before it came out
[14:24.160 --> 14:32.640]  for, for Android. Um, but if in theory Facebook somehow got better, it was a better experience
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.320]  on Android than it is on the iPhone. That's a threat to Apple. If people's favorite app
[14:37.320 --> 14:42.560]  and most used app is Facebook and word spreads around that, Oh, but you can't do the cool
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.280]  new X, Y, and Z that all your friends who have Android phones are doing on Facebook
[14:46.280 --> 14:50.300]  unless you get an Android phone. Like that's Facebook is so big and so popular that if
[14:50.300 --> 14:55.000]  something like that happened hypothetically, that's a problem for Apple. Yeah. I don't
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.600]  want to relitigate the whole app store thing, but when you look at it, if you look at the
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.440]  app store, you look at Google play, for example, Google plays offers freedoms and features
[15:01.440 --> 15:05.240]  that a lot of app store developers have been wanting for years, but you can't really point
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.200]  to those two things on Google play and say those are apps that aren't, those are transformative
[15:09.200 --> 15:13.000]  apps that are simply not possible on iPhone. You can get Snapchat on iPhone, you can get
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.160]  Uber on iPhone, but if there was ever a case where an app could only exist on Android because
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.840]  the policies or capabilities of Google play and the Android ecosystem were such to make
[15:21.840 --> 15:25.720]  it. So that would, I think be the only thing that could really change Apple's outlook on
[15:25.720 --> 15:30.040]  how all that thing on how iOS and the app store works. Right. If you really think about
[15:30.040 --> 15:42.840]  it, it's Apple's, uh, uh, uh, they have control over the app store that software vendors haven't
[15:42.840 --> 15:47.420]  had previously over their platforms, right. That they didn't have over the Mac because
[15:47.420 --> 15:53.920]  you could, you know, you can install any app you want on the Mac. Um, and so technically
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.080]  yes, they could ban anything, but practically speaking, they don't really have, they have
[15:58.080 --> 16:01.600]  lots of control, but they don't really have total control. Like there's only so far that
[16:01.600 --> 16:07.560]  they can push Facebook on if Facebook is doing shady stuff behind the scenes like they have
[16:07.560 --> 16:13.240]  in the past, like when they used audio APIs or, you know, like they, you know, that was
[16:13.240 --> 16:16.560]  one of them, like where, where in the, over the years when you look and say, well, why
[16:16.560 --> 16:19.880]  in the world is Facebook doing so much in the background and how are they doing it with
[16:19.880 --> 16:25.480]  there's rules of, um, you know, that apps get killed in the background and Facebook
[16:25.480 --> 16:30.880]  at one point, one of the things they did is, um, they, they were playing, there was an
[16:30.880 --> 16:34.920]  API so that an app that's playing audio can keep playing it in the background indefinitely
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.320]  and it won't get killed because if you, let's say playing a podcast and you're not, you're
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.160]  doing other things on your phone, like you're going through email and browsing the web while
[16:44.160 --> 16:46.720]  you're listening to the podcast, you don't want your podcast player to get killed by
[16:46.720 --> 16:50.720]  iOS because it's quote unquote in the background because you're, you're getting something from
[16:50.720 --> 16:58.720]  it. It's playing audio. So Facebook used that API to play a completely silent audio track
[16:58.720 --> 17:03.400]  so that they could keep going in the background while they do other things like waiting for
[17:03.400 --> 17:08.280]  notifications and whatever else they're doing. And it's almost as egregious as when they
[17:08.280 --> 17:12.600]  had two hamburger buttons on both sides of the app. Right. I'd say that this was worse.
[17:12.600 --> 17:16.520]  I have two hamburger buttons. Don't run your battery down. So this problem still exists.
[17:16.520 --> 17:19.320]  Like, uh, I think it was a month ago, people started complaining about the same issue with
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.320]  Pokemon go and I started investigating and if you go, it says we like two or three hours
[17:23.320 --> 17:27.720]  on the background audio, which is not something that any app besides a screaming client to
[17:27.720 --> 17:34.080]  ever present. It should get Jetson immediately. Right. Uh, and so Facebook can get away with
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.360]  stuff like that in a way that other companies can't. Uh, the other good example of that,
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.920]  I mean, I don't want to tie too many stories together, but while we're on it is the, uh,
[17:43.920 --> 17:52.440]  story that came out a few weeks ago about Uber, um, getting caught by Apple. Um, we
[17:52.440 --> 17:56.360]  could save that though. Maybe we should save that for after the strike. Um, so anyway,
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.360]  iPhone in China, what else, what else do we have to say about that? Uh, well, I think
[18:00.360 --> 18:04.480]  just beyond China is that Tim Cook used the same sort of wording when he spoke about iPad
[18:04.480 --> 18:09.600]  and said that, you know, I large screened iPads were up, uh, sales of all large screen
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.640]  iPads were up when overall iPad sales were down again. And that's sort of was pointing
[18:13.640 --> 18:18.880]  the finger right at the iPad mini. Yeah, I think so. That I, I think that the reading
[18:18.880 --> 18:22.600]  between the lines on that, that is a good, I, that did strike me to reading between the
[18:22.600 --> 18:30.840]  lines on that and also looking at the revenue number, which wasn't really up either. Like,
[18:30.840 --> 18:38.240]  um, like for example, for the Mac sales unit sales were up 4% good year over year from
[18:38.240 --> 18:47.240]  the same three months last year, but revenue was up 14%. So 4% units, 14% revenue. That
[18:47.240 --> 18:52.760]  tells me that the new Mac book pros are selling pretty well because that's the only thing
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.840]  that's new in the lineup. Uh, the ASPs are higher on those models and the ASPs are higher
[18:57.840 --> 19:02.960]  on those models. And so, you know, that, that it's, you know, if you're, if there's any
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.040]  concern out there that the sort of mixed reviews, those Mac book pros got, it doesn't seem like
[19:07.040 --> 19:10.640]  it's had an adverse effect on sales. Seems like the opposite, that they're actually proving
[19:10.640 --> 19:17.320]  to be pretty popular because they've driven the revenue per unit up. Um, but with the
[19:17.320 --> 19:23.320]  iPad, with them saying, and again, you know, it, it, those, those analyst calls are, you
[19:23.320 --> 19:28.080]  know, they can't lie on them or else they're committing securities fraud. Like they're
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.400]  very, very careful. I mean, you know, because you got, you read the transcript and read
[19:31.400 --> 19:36.600]  every word. I mean, it's not loosey goosey talk. Uh, no. And they are well prepared.
[19:36.600 --> 19:40.600]  They have every fact in front of them before they get on that microphone. Right. So if
[19:40.600 --> 19:47.320]  they say, I mean, again, they don't, they, you know, in the actual PDF data document
[19:47.320 --> 19:53.080]  for the quarterly numbers, they, they give you units per product line, uh, like just
[19:53.080 --> 19:57.720]  for iPad and the revenue for the product line. And that's it. And so they, they don't break
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.440]  down in the old days, like 10 years ago, they used to break down, like for example, Mac
[20:01.440 --> 20:06.720]  sales by desktop and notebook. Um, but they don't have any breakdown like that for iPads,
[20:06.720 --> 20:11.080]  like between big and small. But if they stay on the call, the big ones are up it, but they
[20:11.080 --> 20:16.120]  must be up, right? Like it's either that or they're committing securities fraud. But given
[20:16.120 --> 20:20.320]  that that everything was still down, that must mean that iPad mini sales have just dropped
[20:20.320 --> 20:24.720]  off the face of the earth, which makes sense given the advent of the larger phones and
[20:24.720 --> 20:29.000]  the lack of updates to the iPad mini platform. Yeah. It's sort of a chicken and egg question
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.920]  for me is are they not even updating the iPad mini because people aren't buying the iPad
[20:35.920 --> 20:39.240]  mini or are people not buying the iPad mini because they haven't updated the iPad mini
[20:39.240 --> 20:43.280]  in a while? Well, this is, this is a bit of a tangent, but I went to a mutual friend of
[20:43.280 --> 20:47.680]  ours sort of prodded us about Mac OS server the other day. So I went to pick up a Mac
[20:47.680 --> 20:51.960]  mini so that we could write a series of articles on iMore about the benefits of Mac OS server.
[20:51.960 --> 20:57.960]  And I went to the Apple store, I bought it, took it home and it was running El Cap, which
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.200]  I mean that to me shows there's not a huge turnover rate on Mac minis. And we talked
[21:02.200 --> 21:05.560]  about how Mac mini is a languishing product and it's the same chicken and the egg problem,
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.480]  and that sort of gave me an indicator about how few Mac minis might actually be moving.
[21:10.480 --> 21:25.040]  It's pretty telling. It'd be funny if it opened it up and it was running like Tiger
[21:25.040 --> 21:30.200]  or something like that. Oh, that'd be great. Right? It's got the old Aqua stripes. It's
[21:30.200 --> 21:37.760]  like, how old is this? Power PC apps. I'm trying to think of anything else from the
[21:37.760 --> 21:44.120]  quarterly results. Services are way up, which is as predicted. I mean, they've been saying
[21:44.120 --> 21:51.480]  this for a while that, hey, we're, you know, we're hell bent on services and it's showing
[21:51.480 --> 21:55.440]  in the results. And it's repeatable revenue from the same customer base. So it's sort
[21:55.440 --> 21:58.640]  of the revenue that Wall Street likes. Cause you, like we saw in China, you can't guarantee
[21:58.640 --> 22:01.800]  someone's going to buy the next iPhone, but if they're paying you subscription revenue,
[22:01.800 --> 22:04.980]  you have a certain amount of period. You can look forward to that revenue. Well, and I
[22:04.980 --> 22:10.280]  think, I think the other thing that, and it ties into my argument on the software being
[22:10.280 --> 22:16.300]  more important than the hardware in terms of not in any particular quarter, but in the
[22:16.300 --> 22:22.400]  long run of having a loyal customer base that when they go to replace their blank, whether
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.400]  it's their watch or whether it's their phone or whether it's their laptop, if they've already
[22:26.400 --> 22:33.880]  got an Apple one, they're going to buy another Apple one. And to have the services revenue
[22:33.880 --> 22:39.400]  is a sign that they're creating new ways that make more stickiness in that regard. Yeah.
[22:39.400 --> 22:42.440]  I mean, it's good in both directions too. And I think they've even said this on the
[22:42.440 --> 22:46.480]  call is that you, not in these terms though, is that you can either double your amount
[22:46.480 --> 22:49.360]  of customers or you can double the amount of revenue you get from your customers. And
[22:49.360 --> 22:53.240]  both of them result in substantial increases. And as Apple starts to reach those, those
[22:53.240 --> 22:56.580]  big numbers where it's really hard to start opening up new iPhone markets, you've got
[22:56.580 --> 23:00.560]  Verizon, you've got international carriers, you've got China mobile, getting people onto
[23:00.560 --> 23:04.360]  higher revenue streams with things like subscription services just creates more value from each
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.400]  customer. Right. And I think it's important too, because Apple is, if Apple is Apple,
[23:09.400 --> 23:15.080]  they're never going to, they're never going to have market share, like monopoly market
[23:15.080 --> 23:19.300]  share of these products because they're just, they just, it's just not what Apple does is
[23:19.300 --> 23:26.420]  make products that are so low priced as to, you know, take over the commodity level market.
[23:26.420 --> 23:31.120]  I mean, that's just, it wouldn't, an Apple that tried to do that would no longer be recognizable
[23:31.120 --> 23:35.320]  as the Apple we know. There's certain markets they just choose not to compete in. Right.
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.280]  And you know, it's, you know, whatever percentage of the PC market they have four or five, six,
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.920]  10%, whatever you want to call it, you know, their market of the phone, you know, is higher,
[23:46.920 --> 23:52.680]  significantly higher than that, but it still is a minority and not even close to 50%. It's,
[23:52.680 --> 23:57.120]  you know, even in the most popular iPhone countries, it's, you know, 20%, something
[23:57.120 --> 24:00.200]  like that. It's where we see the differential between their market share and their profit
[24:00.200 --> 24:05.080]  share. Right. And you know, being able to get more money out of the existing customers
[24:05.080 --> 24:10.680]  is a path to growth that is, it lets them still be Apple. And there was one other thing
[24:10.680 --> 24:13.360]  that I thought was really interesting and that's when he was talking about Apple watch
[24:13.360 --> 24:16.680]  and they still won't give numbers. They did the Amazon like thing where they said we had
[24:16.680 --> 24:21.280]  almost twice the amount of sales as last year. So X was last year. This was 2X. But then
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.000]  Tim Cook said that if you take Apple watch and you combine it with AirPods and with Beats,
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.880]  although he wasn't specific which Beats products, just the W1 or all of them, that
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.280]  makes a Fortune 500 company. Yeah. My guess is there's a large amount of Beats money
[24:32.280 --> 24:40.440]  in there. It makes a Fortune 500 company. Yeah. Well, let's take a break and we'll
[24:40.440 --> 24:46.640]  come back to that because I have some comments on the watch. But let me take a break and
[24:46.640 --> 24:53.040]  thank our first sponsor. It's a good friend of ours. You know, Squarespace. Squarespace
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.560]  is the place to go if you need to make a new website. I say this all the time. They sponsored
[24:58.560 --> 25:03.080]  the show for a long time. I'm telling you right now, next time you have an idea for
[25:03.080 --> 25:10.120]  a website, any kind of website, any project that needs a website, a podcast, a store,
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.320]  try it at Squarespace first. You will be, if you haven't recently or never have, you
[25:15.320 --> 25:21.160]  will be surprised at how easy and flexible Squarespace is to create a website, how totally
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.840]  non-technical you have to be. You just do it right there in the website. You see the
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.760]  website. You pick from a template. It looks like it. You see it right there on your screen.
[25:31.760 --> 25:35.920]  And then if you want to move elements around, you just drag them around. If you are technically
[25:35.920 --> 25:41.880]  savvy enough to want to put your own JavaScript in or modify the CSS or something like that,
[25:41.880 --> 25:46.720]  you can do it. You would be surprised. Here's the other thing too, because part of the easiness
[25:46.720 --> 25:50.640]  of using Squarespace is this ability to pick templates and they have so many of them from
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.920]  different types of sites and have a professionally looking website. But I hear that. If I'm listening
[25:55.920 --> 25:59.720]  to this show and I hear that, my thought turns to, well, I don't want to have a cookie
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.720]  cutter site that looks like everybody else's. Like, say, back in the day when you'd get
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.240]  like a Blogspot blog and you'd know it was a Blogspot blog because there were like two
[26:09.240 --> 26:12.760]  or three templates to choose from and everybody had one of those.
[26:12.760 --> 26:15.760]  Squarespace has so many templates to choose from and the templates they have, you can
[26:15.760 --> 26:19.800]  modify them so easily to customize them to your own brand that you don't even know
[26:19.800 --> 26:23.760]  when you're on a Squarespace site. It's unbelievable to me how many sites, when you
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.800]  start poking around and looking in the source code and you see that it's a Squarespace
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.160]  site, you're like, wow. I never would have guessed that because it looks so uniquely
[26:31.160 --> 26:37.480]  branded to this restaurant or clothing company or whatever it is you're trying to make.
[26:37.480 --> 26:44.240]  So next time you make a website, build it with Squarespace and use the code GRUBER,
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.720]  my last name, and when you pay, you will save 10% off your first order. Remember that next
[26:49.720 --> 26:54.960]  time you need to make a website.
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.920]  Sometimes I worry that I repeat myself too often, Rene, that I've got like three or
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.140]  four columns and I just keep writing them all over and over and over again. But the
[27:03.140 --> 27:07.760]  one I just wrote a couple of weeks ago was some, I forget the guy's name, but somebody
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.640]  wrote a column that the Apple Watch hasn't changed Apple, hasn't done anything for
[27:11.640 --> 27:18.640]  Apple at all. And I think if you read between the lines of his arguments, it's more or
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.800]  less that the Apple Watch is nowhere near an iPhone-sized product and probably never
[27:24.800 --> 27:32.160]  will be, and therefore it's meaningless to Apple or close to meaningless. And I just
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.640]  think that's such a wrong way to look at it. There might never be another iPhone-sized
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.360]  product in any industry, let alone Apple. Apple may not ever have an iPhone-sized hit.
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.040]  It may well be that no other company has an iPhone-sized hit in terms of just how much
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.880]  money and how many people around the world the market size is. And so I think judged
[27:54.880 --> 28:01.640]  by that, nothing Apple ever does will succeed by that merit. And I think if Apple internally
[28:01.640 --> 28:04.520]  took that mindset, it would paralyze the company.
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.900]  Yeah. I mean, iPhone creates more profit than companies that have oligopoly control over
[28:09.900 --> 28:14.580]  scarce fossil fuel resources. And people forget that perspective. And they create this false
[28:14.580 --> 28:19.000]  equivalency where everything for Apple has to be measured by the success of iPhone and
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.160]  then everything is seemed to be lacking. Where for other companies, you could sell three
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.080]  Surface books and it's a rousing success and you'll get 19 articles out of that. When
[28:27.080 --> 28:30.980]  we saw that, I think, I forget if it was Neil Seibert or Benedict Evans who tweeted that
[28:30.980 --> 28:37.480]  – based on their metrics, Apple Watch vastly outsold – it was a factor of two or three
[28:37.480 --> 28:43.400]  – Amazon's Echo product. And yet people were touting how great and transformative
[28:43.400 --> 28:47.440]  Echo was and what a dismal failure Apple Watch was. And it was completely out of whack with
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.600]  anything resembling any resemblance to facts. Right. It's graded on such a bizarre curve.
[28:53.600 --> 28:59.660]  And it's a perfect example because Alexa, like every other Amazon product, the Echo
[28:59.660 --> 29:07.240]  doesn't get numbers reported and Apple Watch gets a Bezos curve of twice as much as ever.
[29:07.240 --> 29:10.240]  Yeah. And it's true. It's really important technology.
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.280]  You can kind of – at least with Apple Watch, it's in that other category and you can
[29:14.280 --> 29:22.840]  – there is a revenue number for the – it's like the headphones and Beats and Apple TV
[29:22.840 --> 29:35.480]  and Apple Watch. And given – Apple TV is almost certainly pretty static. There hasn't
[29:35.480 --> 29:38.440]  been an update. There hasn't been a big promotional push. There hasn't been a big
[29:38.440 --> 29:45.960]  change since the fall 2015 when the current Apple TV came out. So it's pretty reasonable
[29:45.960 --> 29:49.920]  to assume Apple TV is flat at best.
[29:49.920 --> 29:53.360]  Aeropods is a little hard to gauge for this quarter because they're obviously popular
[29:53.360 --> 30:01.040]  enough that they're backordered. But it's hard to tell like just how constrained they
[30:01.040 --> 30:02.040]  are.
[30:02.040 --> 30:06.180]  I think you pointed out that they're not sold at a huge margin. They're sold as cheaply
[30:06.180 --> 30:07.180]  as possible.
[30:07.180 --> 30:09.680]  Well, the revenue number though might be big because they don't – they're not going
[30:09.680 --> 30:14.140]  to break that down by profit. But I have reason to believe that they're not a big money
[30:14.140 --> 30:20.280]  maker at this point. And it makes sense that they must be hard to make because it's four
[30:20.280 --> 30:24.520]  months in and they're still six weeks out if you go to order them.
[30:24.520 --> 30:28.720]  As an aside on that, for anybody looking to buy Aeropods, I wrote about that on Daring
[30:28.720 --> 30:32.240]  Firebolt a couple of times recently. And a couple of people have written to me and said
[30:32.240 --> 30:43.060]  that they scored Aeropods on the fly recently from like AT&T stores or like Verizon stores
[30:43.060 --> 30:49.120]  that they're showing up. If you really want them and you don't want to wait six weeks,
[30:49.120 --> 30:53.440]  try stores like AT&T and Best Buy and stuff like that. And you might just get lucky and
[30:53.440 --> 30:57.080]  get them before you would if you place an order at Apple.com. So that's my tip for
[30:57.080 --> 31:01.720]  anybody out there looking for Aeropods.
[31:01.720 --> 31:07.480]  But the numbers that Apple reported and other back up the idea that Apple Watch is selling
[31:07.480 --> 31:15.920]  pretty well. And personally, and this is obviously very unscientific, but personally I see more
[31:15.920 --> 31:21.920]  Apple Watches on real people out in the streets than ever before. I see an awful lot of them.
[31:21.920 --> 31:25.360]  I went to the deli the other day just to order a Montreal smoked meat sandwich and the waiter
[31:25.360 --> 31:28.200]  was wearing an Apple Watch and I asked him how he liked it. And he said, best thing in
[31:28.200 --> 31:30.880]  the world. We're not allowed to have our phones with us when we work, but I can still
[31:30.880 --> 31:33.640]  check my text messages on my Apple Watch.
[31:33.640 --> 31:39.360]  There's a big construction project across the street from my house. And I noticed the
[31:39.360 --> 31:47.960]  other day that the guy who controls the crane is wearing an Apple Watch. And I thought that
[31:47.960 --> 31:52.720]  that might be the exact reason for that is that while he's doing this, he can't have
[31:52.720 --> 31:57.800]  his phone out, but if he glances at his wrist, he can see text notifications. I don't know,
[31:57.800 --> 32:02.280]  but it just seems, I see them all the time. I see an awful lot of them. It backs up the
[32:02.280 --> 32:08.800]  market. Again, not like it's as popular as the iPhone, but nothing is, really, literally.
[32:08.800 --> 32:11.240]  But I sure see them a lot. I really do.
[32:11.240 --> 32:14.920]  It does a subset of important brief tasks for you in a way that saves you having to
[32:14.920 --> 32:18.000]  go to your iPhone, the same way your iPhone does a subset of really important tasks that
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.720]  saves you having to go to your Mac. So it just depends how important those are to you.
[32:21.720 --> 32:24.920]  While we're talking about Apple Watch, we can tie in the other story from this week
[32:24.920 --> 32:32.840]  where Apple Insider discovered that a couple of big-name apps, iPhone apps, have dropped
[32:32.840 --> 32:39.000]  their Apple Watch counterparts. Was it Amazon, eBay? And the one that, to me, was most telling
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.000]  was Google Maps.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.600]  Yeah, I have to admit, when I first heard this story, my guess—and I checked into
[32:44.600 --> 32:47.560]  it, but I couldn't get an answer—was that it happened at the same time they launched
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.520]  their iMessage app. And I just thought they screwed up something in their bundle and enabled
[32:50.520 --> 32:54.640]  the iMessage app and disabled the Apple Watch app by accident. And I don't know if that's
[32:54.640 --> 32:58.160]  true, or they're going to be updating it for Watch OS 4 or whatever, but their subsequent
[32:58.160 --> 33:02.160]  statement made it sound like it was returning. It was not a deliberate removal.
[33:02.160 --> 33:07.840]  Well, but the telling part is that it seemingly happened weeks ago, and nobody really noticed.
[33:07.840 --> 33:11.360]  I mean, Serenity noticed right away, and she's like, what's happening here? And started
[33:11.360 --> 33:14.720]  looking into it, but it wasn't a huge story, no?
[33:14.720 --> 33:20.480]  I just think, though, I really do. And I think the emphasis that Apple—I think Apple is
[33:20.480 --> 33:30.720]  fully aware of this based on what they worked on for iOS 3 and how they build it, that even
[33:30.720 --> 33:36.480]  with the iPhone, it was true. They certainly, obviously, at the outset, didn't see how
[33:36.480 --> 33:42.920]  big a deal it would be to be an app platform. They might have had the inkling, but it certainly—and
[33:42.920 --> 33:47.360]  I think it's played out in ways that even they couldn't foresee.
[33:47.360 --> 33:52.760]  I don't think Apple would have predicted in 2007 that the iPhone would become the most
[33:52.760 --> 33:58.960]  important and popular camera in the world. You don't know, and I feel like they rolled
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.840]  out the Apple Watch and obviously, I think, initially thought that apps were going to
[34:04.840 --> 34:11.400]  be a bigger part of what might make it popular and in real use, and even their own use, not
[34:11.400 --> 34:18.200]  just surveying users, but I think Apple people using the Watch themselves, that the health
[34:18.200 --> 34:27.880]  tracking and using it as a notifications input and output device are far more important than
[34:27.880 --> 34:30.880]  the app story.
[34:30.880 --> 34:33.880]  I think that's absolutely true. It's almost like they overcompensated for the lack of
[34:33.880 --> 34:37.280]  an app store at launch for iPhone by making sure no matter what happens or how poorly
[34:37.280 --> 34:42.160]  it performed. They had one available for Apple Watch, and almost the heartbreaking part about
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.600]  that is they launched it at the same time that Extensibility was launched, and Extensibility
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.680]  was one of the technologies that allowed them to have apps on the Apple Watch, but at the
[34:50.680 --> 34:55.760]  same time that—you've written this really well—what HTTPS, what web services were
[34:55.760 --> 34:59.020]  to websites where they basically—you didn't need a website anymore. You could just provide
[34:59.020 --> 35:03.000]  an API. Extensions were like that to apps. You didn't necessarily need a binary blob
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.640]  on the same device. You could have features and functionality that could be on the same
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.320]  device but could be projected or surfaced in many different places in many different
[35:11.320 --> 35:12.320]  ways.
[35:12.320 --> 35:15.680]  They had that with Apple Watch, but instead they sort of took this mentality of binary
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.340]  blobs where you had to have an app on a carousel screen that you could tap with your finger
[35:19.340 --> 35:23.000]  to launch. We've seen them move away from that, but I think in hindsight we're going
[35:23.000 --> 35:30.040]  to see that the watch has to be a feature device and not an app device.
[35:30.040 --> 35:38.520]  Yeah, and I played around. He's a friend, and I appreciate the feature, but Marco Arment
[35:38.520 --> 35:45.120]  has worked on a much improved watch app for Overcast, and I know that he spent an awful
[35:45.120 --> 35:52.520]  lot of time in the last few months on it. It shipped recently, and then over the weekend
[35:52.520 --> 35:58.660]  I thought, well, I was going to go for a run. In theory, I would love to go with just my
[35:58.660 --> 36:07.760]  watch and AirPods and not have to figure out a way to carry my phone because there's just
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.000]  no great way. I've got some kind of belt-like thing that I put underneath my shirt where
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.580]  I can strap it in, but I don't want to run with it in my pockets. I don't like using
[36:16.580 --> 36:20.400]  an armband. There's no good way to go with a phone.
[36:20.400 --> 36:28.680]  I thought, well, this is perfect. I'm not just trying this watch app of Overcast out.
[36:28.680 --> 36:32.440]  I actually want this feature. I would love to do this, and it was absolutely horrible.
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.960]  It was just terrible. It was hard to get it installed on the watch in the first place,
[36:36.960 --> 36:42.800]  which shouldn't be the case. It was like from the watch app on the phone, it said installing,
[36:42.800 --> 36:48.640]  and it just said installing dot, dot, dot forever, and then once it was installed, getting
[36:48.640 --> 36:54.160]  audio, it's like getting audio from the phone to the watch takes forever. Even once
[36:54.160 --> 36:59.320]  it did, and I got a podcast over there to listen to, and I went to play, I got my AirPod
[36:59.320 --> 37:05.400]  synced to it, the audio was whisper quiet. I mentioned this to Marco, and it's obviously
[37:05.400 --> 37:08.560]  not always the case, and other people are saying it happens sometimes, but he has no
[37:08.560 --> 37:15.800]  idea why. I wasted 45 minutes, and I was just like, you know what? Screw it. I'm just
[37:15.800 --> 37:22.200]  going with my phone like I always do. It was so much better. I mean, it's just too finicky.
[37:22.200 --> 37:28.520]  It's way too finicky, whereas there are other things like... Do you ever use this app?
[37:28.520 --> 37:30.760]  Do you ever use the service Nuzzle and use ZZEL?
[37:30.760 --> 37:32.720]  I've seen it. Yeah, I've used it on the iPhone.
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.000]  It's really great. It's a service. You sign in with your Twitter account, and what
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.640]  it does is it's really, really great if anybody out there wants to try it. I find
[37:42.640 --> 37:45.760]  tons of stuff that I link to on Daring Fireball from it, but what it does is it follows your
[37:45.760 --> 37:50.080]  own... The people you follow on Twitter, and when a certain threshold of the people
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.200]  you follow have all tweeted the same link or a link to the same article, it gives you
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.800]  a notification about it on the assumption that if like five people you follow have all
[37:57.800 --> 38:03.140]  tweeted the same link to blank, you want to know about blank, and it gives you a notification
[38:03.140 --> 38:07.860]  for that. When I first heard about it, I thought that
[38:07.860 --> 38:10.760]  this is going to be something that I'm going to try and quickly get rid of because I'm
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.800]  sort of sensitive to getting... I don't want too many notifications from anything. I find
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.080]  that whatever algorithm Nuzzle uses to do this... Maybe it's super simple. Maybe it's
[38:20.080 --> 38:26.000]  just... I don't know, but just the idea that if five of the people I follow on Twitter
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.400]  link the same thing, I want to know about it. The ratio of interesting links to the
[38:32.400 --> 38:38.520]  times they notify me is so high that I have no interest in turning it off, but they don't
[38:38.520 --> 38:43.460]  have a watch app, but the notifications go to my watch just automatically.
[38:43.460 --> 38:46.560]  The only thing I would want from them on my watch, they don't even need a watch app for
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.240]  because the notifications, if my phone is in my pocket, automatically go to my watch.
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.960]  It's so great. I remember Brad Ellis was saying that when
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.960] ... I forget when watch was introduced that, in his opinion, developers should spend more
[38:57.960 --> 39:01.880]  time making a really awesome notification experience and not worry about an app at all.
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.360]  That turns out to be canny advice. Right. Nuzzle doesn't even have a watch app,
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.520]  and to me, the watch app that I get is exactly what I want.
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.080]  Poor Marco spent months working on an advanced watch app that maybe someday will turn into
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.640]  something that's actually good and useful, like a future version of the watch. Maybe
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.360]  the foundation will be there so that when the watch actually gets its own LTE or something
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.540]  like that, it actually will be useful. But he spent all this time on it, and I don't
[39:30.540 --> 39:33.280]  want to use it at all, even though I use Overcast almost every day.
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.320]  Yeah, I've tried it. I like it. It has the issues that you mentioned, and I always have
[39:37.320 --> 39:42.800]  my iPhone with me even if I'm out, so I haven't been forced to use it. It's a problem that
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.280]  people want solved, but it is not something that is technically solvable right now.
[39:46.280 --> 39:50.400]  In all honesty, if Overcast didn't have a watch app, it wouldn't matter to me at all
[39:50.400 --> 39:54.360]  because the only thing I ever really do, I can do through the now playing anyway.
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.920]  Yeah. I don't know. I feel like there's something
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.520]  that Apple—I think they're well aware of it. That's what I think, and I think we'll
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.400]  see more. I think we'll see it go that way. Yeah, I think it's a classic example of—they
[40:08.400 --> 40:11.080]  saw everything as a nail. They had an app store hammer, and then everything looked like
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.060]  an app nail to them. In hindsight, you can look back and say, we needed a different approach
[40:15.060 --> 40:19.720]  for this. I think they've known that for over a year and a half, which is why we saw
[40:19.720 --> 40:26.360]  watchOS 3, and we'll see watchOS 4 be different. Yeah, it'd be interesting to see what they
[40:26.360 --> 40:32.560]  do with that. Anything else on quarterly results before we move on?
[40:32.560 --> 40:38.000]  No. I saw at the same time Tim Cook was on Jim Cramer and said that he used Apple Watch
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.200]  to lose 30 pounds, which I don't know where that was from.
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.120]  Right. Again, Tim Cook does not strike me as a bullshitter, right?
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.800]  No. Like, if he says he lost 30 pounds, I think
[40:50.800 --> 40:58.800]  he probably lost 30 pounds, but I've seen him on stage every six months for five, six
[40:58.800 --> 41:06.520]  years, and there was never any point where it looked like he put on or lost 30 pounds.
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.680]  But anyway— More power to him. It was amazing.
[41:10.680 --> 41:18.480]  What did the—it was a pretty good interview. I give Jim Cramer credit for a guy who's not
[41:18.480 --> 41:24.400]  really an Apple person, but rather a finance person. I thought it was a pretty informative
[41:24.400 --> 41:32.680]  interview. I think that this announcement of a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing
[41:32.680 --> 41:37.160]  jobs in the U.S. is pretty interesting. That's what Cook announced. The details aren't
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.720]  out yet. I think he said to come in at the end of May.
[41:41.720 --> 41:47.160]  I think so. It was entirely—I mean, it was super interesting
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.280]  when you start to decompose the relationship that Apple has with the administration, who's
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.560]  heavily pro-U.S. jobs and U.S. manufacturing and all these elements where Apple has a massive
[41:56.560 --> 42:00.560]  manufacturing capacity outside the U.S., but also a massive amount of money, which we heard
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.260]  about on the call as well, that they want to repatriate. And the last time that happened
[42:04.260 --> 42:07.760]  was under the Bush administration, and this administration might be more amenable. So
[42:07.760 --> 42:16.600]  I think it's a very careful balancing act. Right. And it's—yeah, because one thing
[42:16.600 --> 42:26.080]  that has happened in recent years is Apple has had this large cash poured for a long
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.760]  time now, although the definition of large keeps growing.
[42:30.760 --> 42:35.360]  Yeah, letting out the waste band. But it has changed, even though they've
[42:35.360 --> 42:40.360]  sort of capped it off now where it's not really growing so much and rather, however
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.560]  much it would be growing, they just keep giving to the shareholder, whatever they call it.
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.400]  It's growing despite one of the biggest give-backs in corporate history.
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.880]  Right. But one shift that has happened, though, is that their U.S. holdings have shrunk, and
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.080]  it's almost entirely overseas. What they have now is almost entirely overseas. And
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.160]  so, for like this billion-dollar fund in the U.S., they're going to borrow to get the
[43:04.160 --> 43:08.280]  money rather than use it because they don't really have a—you know, they have a billion,
[43:08.280 --> 43:13.280]  but it's— I don't have it on me.
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.280]  It's in my wallet over in Ireland.
[43:17.280 --> 43:20.080]  No, very true.
[43:20.080 --> 43:25.720]  But it'll be interesting to see what comes of that. And it's—I don't think Apple
[43:25.720 --> 43:33.760]  is a—and they've been thinking about this for a while. I mean, with the Mac Pro, that
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.660]  was 2013 where they announced that it would be assembled in the U.S. I mean, so it's
[43:37.660 --> 43:42.760]  not like they haven't—like all of a sudden, just with Trump in office, they're now looking
[43:42.760 --> 43:50.400]  to tow the line on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. But I don't think—and
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.560]  I think if there's a Trumpian aspect to it, I don't think it's so much about towing
[43:54.560 --> 44:05.520]  the line or wanting to please the Trump administration, but more a pragmatic, let's make sure we
[44:05.520 --> 44:12.160]  don't get caught flat-footed if they start a trade war with China or do some—impose
[44:12.160 --> 44:17.120]  some other tariff or something like that. Let's be ready for anything that might happen
[44:17.120 --> 44:24.080]  now that somebody with his temperament and his stated policies toward overseas manufacturing
[44:24.080 --> 44:25.080]  jobs is in office.
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.760]  It's almost like preemptive positioning when they bought stake in Didi in China, because
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.980]  there's certain volatility in that leadership as well. And it's true. I think that was
[44:35.980 --> 44:41.280]  back when they were doing the iFactory series in New York Times. And that was a big story.
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.800]  And Apple making Mac Pros in the U.S. was a very good story for that, too. It'll be
[44:46.800 --> 44:48.840]  interesting to see where this goes.
[44:48.840 --> 44:59.960]  Yeah, it will be. Again, you can say—I saw it on CNBC after the Kramer thing had aired,
[44:59.960 --> 45:09.400]  where somebody was like, you know, given Apple's $250 billion cash holdings and their quarterly
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.360]  revenue, it's easy to say a billion dollars isn't that much to Apple. But still, a billion
[45:14.360 --> 45:19.200]  dollars is a billion dollars, and saying you're going to commit a billion dollars to assembling—to
[45:19.200 --> 45:22.000]  advanced assembly and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. is significant.
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.760]  Yeah. If you have $250, you've got to give a dollar away. It's still a dollar you've
[45:25.760 --> 45:26.760]  got to give away.
[45:26.760 --> 45:31.840]  Right. And it's—a billion is a little different than one dollar.
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.680]  Any problem is easy to solve, but you're not the one in charge of solving it. That's
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.400]  what the media keeps forgetting, I think.
[45:41.400 --> 45:45.080]  Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Casper.
[45:45.080 --> 45:50.000]  You guys know Casper. They make an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.680]  We just bought a new Casper mattress here at the Gruber family home. Our son needed
[45:54.680 --> 45:59.960]  a new bed. Got him a Casper. He loves it. Absolutely loves it. He literally, honest
[45:59.960 --> 46:07.000]  to God, he was mad at me that I didn't get him one sooner. It was that—we were that
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.600]  happy with it. He's that happy with it. It's a great mattress.
[46:11.600 --> 46:15.200]  So here's the deal. This is my favorite thing about them. They don't make you choose a
[46:15.200 --> 46:19.680]  type of mattress. When you need a mattress, you go there, you pick a size, and that's
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.080]  all. And then it comes to you, and you open it up, and you've got a mattress. How do
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.040]  you ship a mattress to somebody? Guess what? It's the fact that they make it out of like
[46:28.040 --> 46:37.480]  this—their own custom blend of like foams. It comes in a little box. Little box meaning
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.760]  like it might be the biggest package that you're going to get this year delivered
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.760]  to your house, but for a mattress, it's a surprisingly small box. And then they have
[46:46.760 --> 46:49.760]  nice instructions on the outside. They tell you to bring it up to the room where you want
[46:49.760 --> 46:56.040]  it first. Don't open it up downstairs. Go to the bedroom. Follow their instructions.
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.480]  You open it up. It sucks all the air out of the room to fill the mattress, so be careful.
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.920]  Be careful. Make sure you take a deep breath before you open it up.
[47:04.920 --> 47:07.880]  And there you go. You've got a mattress, and it's comfortable, and it's nice. It's
[47:07.880 --> 47:12.000]  just a nice mattress. And the prices, because they sell directly—they make them right
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.280]  here in the U.S., by the way. They make them here in the U.S. They sell them to you directly.
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.040]  There's no middleman. There's no markup for a retail store or anything like that.
[47:20.040 --> 47:26.160]  Their prices blow away the prices for premium mattresses from the big-name mattress companies.
[47:26.160 --> 47:29.440]  There's just no comparison.
[47:29.440 --> 47:35.200]  Where do you go? Get yours today. You try it for a hundred nights in your own home with
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.280]  free delivery. So you don't have to take my word for it. That's comfortable. Go buy
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.520]  one. Have it delivered. Try it out. You've got over three months, a hundred nights, and
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.040]  if you're not happy with it, no questions asked, they will just arrange for someone
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.040]  to come and get it out of your house. No questions asked.
[47:52.040 --> 47:57.760]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show and use that code the talk show, and you will save
[47:57.760 --> 48:03.320]  fifty bucks towards any mattress. Put an asterisk right here. You can't save fifty bucks on
[48:03.320 --> 48:06.320]  their dog mattresses. I'm sorry, because the dog mattresses are only like a couple
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.080]  hundred bucks. But if you have a dog and you want to get your dog a bed, get them a Casper.
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.560]  They have an amazing, amazing dog mattress. And I keep mentioning it, and readers keep
[48:15.560 --> 48:19.840]  saying that they bought it for their dog, and their dog won't get up off the mattress.
[48:19.840 --> 48:25.800]  So there you go. My thanks to Casper, makers of fine mattresses.
[48:25.800 --> 48:29.320]  What else happened recently? I guess this week, Microsoft had their education event,
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.560]  and they unveiled two things. They unveiled on the hardware side, this is their first
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.560]  true laptop, something that's not like a detachable tablet type thing that they call
[48:39.560 --> 48:48.800]  the Surface Laptop. And they unveiled a new operating system called Windows 10 S, which
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.480]  do you want to talk about first? I was going to say Joe Belfiore's new blonde
[48:52.480 --> 48:54.080]  haircut. Oh.
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.960]  He famously Windows phoned Joe Belfiore, who went away for a year and decided to focus
[48:58.960 --> 49:02.120]  on education, and then came back and is now leading this initiative.
[49:02.120 --> 49:05.600]  I didn't see that part of the show. Yeah, I don't think they put him on stage,
[49:05.600 --> 49:10.320]  which was interesting. They had Meyerson on stage, yeah. He was out front beforehand.
[49:10.320 --> 49:13.240]  I think maybe the hardware first, because— Were you there?
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.640]  No, we had Daniel Rubino, one of my colleagues, was there.
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.560]  I watched the video, but I really only watched the video for the 10 S part. I didn't watch
[49:22.560 --> 49:25.400]  the hardware part. So what do you want to talk about first?
[49:25.400 --> 49:28.080]  The hardware? All right, let's talk about the hardware.
[49:28.080 --> 49:31.680]  It's so interesting, and I'm going to start off with this, because why not? It's the
[49:31.680 --> 49:36.840]  talk show. If this laptop had an Apple logo on it, I think the coverage would have been
[49:36.840 --> 49:40.920]  very different than what we saw. How so?
[49:40.920 --> 49:44.480]  Because there was a lot of things about this laptop that were very Apple-esque. The design
[49:44.480 --> 49:49.400]  looks almost identical to a MacBook Air. The price was almost identical to a MacBook Air.
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.240]  You know, a lot of the video and the language that they used for it was very similar to
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.000]  Apple. It's got one port on it, USB-A port instead of a USB-C port, but just one port
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.200]  on it, and it does have the Surface dock, so you can do other things with it.
[50:02.200 --> 50:06.480]  But I think a lot of people who were highly critical of Apple for doing things like a
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.880]  single-port MacBook or any of a dozen decisions they made recently were strangely silent when
[50:12.880 --> 50:15.560]  it came to Microsoft making very similar moves with this laptop.
[50:15.560 --> 50:19.680]  Yeah, one port. It's USB-A, which seems outdated, and then they have a proprietary
[50:19.680 --> 50:20.680]  DisplayPort, right?
[50:20.680 --> 50:22.720]  Yeah, the Surface dock.
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.780]  That to me, the proprietary DisplayPort seems like the weird part that, like, whoa, if Apple
[50:27.780 --> 50:33.520]  did that, that would seem to generate a lot of criticism.
[50:33.520 --> 50:38.160]  You are true. I wasn't even going to bring that aspect up, but how can Apple release
[50:38.160 --> 50:44.320]  a laptop with one port and get a month of criticism or years of criticism? People still
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.600]  complain about the MacBook. People call it the MacBook One, and then Microsoft releases
[50:50.600 --> 50:55.400]  one with one port. It happens to be outdated. The only other port is a proprietary one,
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.880]  which is an Apple move, and it gets headlines like, here's the laptop, the Apple's — or
[51:02.880 --> 51:06.240]  Microsoft's MacBook killer that Apple can't ignore.
[51:06.240 --> 51:09.800]  And it gets funnier after that because it is running Kaby Lake, which is a generation
[51:09.800 --> 51:13.920]  beyond what Apple ran, and there's reasons for that. The quad-core version of Kaby Lake
[51:13.920 --> 51:17.080]  wasn't ready when Apple needed it. The graphics that Apple wanted, the more powerful
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.520]  graphics were not available when Apple wanted to put them into the MacBook Pro. And this,
[51:20.520 --> 51:24.100]  in fact, doesn't have those sorts of graphics options. So Microsoft made a different choice.
[51:24.100 --> 51:27.840]  They went with a better CPU, but arguably a much worse GPU. But at the same time, there's
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.320]  8 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of RAM, but the 16-gigabyte version doesn't ship for months.
[51:32.320 --> 51:36.080]  And can you imagine if Apple announced the new MacBook Pros that we went to in October
[51:36.080 --> 51:41.280]  and said, oh, by the way, the 16-gigabyte version is not going to ship for a few months?
[51:41.280 --> 51:46.000]  And I also think I went through the configuration on it because there was also some initial
[51:46.000 --> 51:52.720]  Twitter feedback that I saw where it shows how overpriced the MacBook Pros are. And I
[51:52.720 --> 52:02.280]  found the exact opposite, where I configured one with Core i7, 16 gigs of RAM, and a 512-megabyte
[52:02.280 --> 52:12.920]  SSD. And the price was $2,199. And a MacBook with Core i7 and 16 gigs of RAM and a 512-gigabyte
[52:12.920 --> 52:16.400]  SSD was $2,199, the exact same price, $2,199 for both.
[52:16.400 --> 52:26.680]  And Apple offers a one-terabyte SSD. Microsoft doesn't. And Apple will let you get a 16-gigabytes
[52:26.680 --> 52:33.800]  of RAM configuration in the Core i5 variant of the MacBook Pro. And Microsoft doesn't.
[52:33.800 --> 52:39.920]  If you want to get 16 gigs of RAM, you've got to also upgrade to the Core i7. And personally,
[52:39.920 --> 52:50.020]  me personally, I've actually totally changed my personal take on laptops, where for me,
[52:50.020 --> 52:57.520]  I think I'm podcasting from it right now. I have a 2015, or is it 2014? Jeez, I don't
[52:57.520 --> 53:08.280]  even remember. MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Pro. Let's see what they say. I don't remember.
[53:08.280 --> 53:14.400]  My take for years. Oh, mid-2014. So yeah, it's a late 2014 MacBook Pro, 13-inch. It's
[53:14.400 --> 53:19.720]  one of the best computers I've ever owned. I maxed out everything when I bought it. I
[53:19.720 --> 53:25.320]  got the three gigahertz Intel Core i7. I got the 16 gigs of RAM, which is the most I could
[53:25.320 --> 53:29.900]  get. And I got the one-terabyte SSD. And I'm happy with all those decisions, because I've
[53:29.900 --> 53:36.960]  got a couple hundred gigabytes left, but way more than 512. I'm like 700 or something like
[53:36.960 --> 53:44.400]  that. So the one terabyte was useful to me. RAM is the biggest thing I need, because I'm
[53:44.400 --> 53:49.920]  lazy and I always keep lots of Safari tabs open. And Slack itself, even if you run it
[53:49.920 --> 53:59.200]  as an app, takes like a gigabyte of RAM. I don't think I need a Core i7. And I thought
[53:59.200 --> 54:05.440]  this, when I was testing, I had a couple of the review units of the new MacBook Pros from
[54:05.440 --> 54:13.040]  October. There's nothing I do on a day-to-day basis where having a Core i7 instead of a
[54:13.040 --> 54:18.960]  Core i5 really makes a difference. I don't use Xcode. Or if I do, I do it rarely enough
[54:18.960 --> 54:24.080]  that the difference in build times. I'm not doing it all day, all day long, where shaving
[54:24.080 --> 54:30.280]  some time off the build and run cycle would really make a difference.
[54:30.280 --> 54:33.880]  Other things I do that might be like batch processing, it doesn't matter to me because
[54:33.880 --> 54:39.360]  it's running in the background. The difference between a Core i5 and Core i7, performance-wise,
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.560]  isn't meaningful to me personally. And the Core i5 is going to get better battery life.
[54:43.560 --> 54:46.840]  And that's more important to me. So I think the next time I get a MacBook Pro, I'd get
[54:46.840 --> 54:53.480]  a Core i5 that would get better battery life, and it's way more than fast enough, and then
[54:53.480 --> 54:58.200]  just max out the SSD and the RAM. And Microsoft won't let you do that. And I find that to
[54:58.200 --> 55:00.080]  be a very useful configuration.
[55:00.080 --> 55:03.960]  I have the exact same MacBook Pro that you have from before, the exact same configuration,
[55:03.960 --> 55:07.240]  and I came to the exact same conclusion about this one. And in fact, I can't mention any
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.120]  names, but someone who knows those chipsets inside and out just told me point blank, don't
[55:11.120 --> 55:13.440]  give Intel the extra money.
[55:13.440 --> 55:20.080]  I really believe that. I really do. And it's not so much that there's anything wrong with
[55:20.080 --> 55:26.120]  the Core i7, but that the Core i5 is just good enough. And I really do on that curve.
[55:26.120 --> 55:31.920]  And I think that's why Apple has wisely made it the default, even on the Pros. It's not
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.160]  just that it's more expensive, but that it's really, it's a good, even for someone who
[55:36.160 --> 55:40.720]  needs a high, you know, relatively on the scale of all of Apple's MacBooks, a higher
[55:40.720 --> 55:44.160]  performance model, the MacBook Pro with the Core i5 is a good one. So anyway.
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.120]  And for that money, you get an extra port. I mean, you're just getting one port for MacBook
[55:47.120 --> 55:48.240]  Pros.
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.120]  So anyway, I do find that interesting on the surface. I'll give them kudos. I don't think
[55:53.120 --> 55:58.680]  it looks like a MacBook Air. I think it's obviously, I think Apple has largely defined
[55:58.680 --> 56:05.720]  the modern laptop in a way that there are some basic fundamental similarities to the
[56:05.720 --> 56:06.720]  MacBook Air.
[56:06.720 --> 56:07.720]  The wedgey design.
[56:07.720 --> 56:12.080]  Yeah, the wedge design is certainly one. But I don't think that's the sort of thing that
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.080]  even me as somebody who's relatively sensitive to people ripping off MacBooks, I don't think
[56:16.080 --> 56:21.600]  that's something that they can, that they could lay ownership to. You know, it's even
[56:21.600 --> 56:28.920]  sort of like, Tim Cook mentioned this, I think, when at the event last year, when they introduced
[56:28.920 --> 56:33.560]  the MacBook Pros, when they went through all of Apple's portables from the beginning of
[56:33.560 --> 56:38.640]  the, at least from the first PowerBook. I think they skipped the Mac portable. But all
[56:38.640 --> 56:42.520]  the ones that you would identify as a laptop, like the Mac portable was portable, but wasn't
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.520]  the laptop.
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.440]  Like, it seems crazy now, but Apple was the first one who put the keyboard back so that
[56:50.440 --> 56:56.080]  you have palm rests in front. All previous laptops had the keys right up to the front
[56:56.080 --> 57:00.960]  of the device. And, you know, so the fact, I just think that's just something that when
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.640]  you see it, you're like, oh, that's an obvious way to do it. I think that the wedge design,
[57:04.640 --> 57:05.640]  yeah.
[57:05.640 --> 57:09.960]  Right. I think the wedge shape of the MacBook Air is an obvious way to shave weight off
[57:09.960 --> 57:15.780]  a device where only some of the components need the full thickness at the back. And if
[57:15.780 --> 57:18.880]  you can make it thinner in the front, you might as well. So I don't hold that against
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.320]  them. Like at a glance, you don't look at it and you wouldn't look at that and think
[57:22.320 --> 57:23.320]  that's a MacBook Air.
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.160]  I did, but I, you know, but I'm willing to concede the point. I watched the video because
[57:28.160 --> 57:31.360]  the video again is very similar to Apple design language and you see that computer opening
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.760]  up and if you squint a little bit, you can't tell the difference.
[57:33.760 --> 57:36.840]  All right. And they do it, you know, they obviously took a lot of pride in the video
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.940]  and it is Apple style video, but it's, there's a lot of pride in the internals too. They
[57:41.940 --> 57:49.140]  show the, um, what would you call it? The, the, um, it's obviously done in, in CGI,
[57:49.140 --> 57:53.840]  but the, the, the computer, the renders, yeah. Coming apart that the, the different parts
[57:53.840 --> 57:58.800]  of it are, are, you know, in the little screws and everything going in, they've gotten
[57:58.800 --> 58:02.000]  much, I mean, from a first software company, they've gotten remarkable hardware chops
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  over the last few years.
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.280]  Well, it's funny though. They've always had a good reputation for making like mice
[58:07.280 --> 58:11.160]  and keyboards, right? The mice, Microsoft mice and keyboards have ever since they got
[58:11.160 --> 58:16.320]  into the business, have had reputation as world-class, you know, but the Xbox line,
[58:16.320 --> 58:24.840]  not so much. No, probably rings and squeaky boxes. Right. Um, but yeah, they, you know,
[58:24.840 --> 58:30.280]  and I even liked the way that the, I think, is it the windows logo or the Microsoft logo?
[58:30.280 --> 58:34.160]  The four rectangles thing, the windows logo. Yeah. Is that what it is? It's, you know,
[58:34.160 --> 58:37.360]  it looks good. It's, you know, they've finally gotten it to a point where it's reduced
[58:37.360 --> 58:43.480]  to a real icon. Uh, it was probably the de facto Microsoft logo by now. Cause I think
[58:43.480 --> 58:47.520]  they use it everywhere. It, they're using a different material. They've got like a,
[58:47.520 --> 58:53.520]  a soft touch, uh, uh, forget the name of it. There's a brand name that I wasn't familiar
[58:53.520 --> 58:59.080]  with, but it's subtle something. Yeah. It's some kind of like fake leather type artificial
[58:59.080 --> 59:04.000]  synthetic leather, what AstroTurf is to grass or something. Um, yeah, but that it's used
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.920]  by, you know, premium luxury auto makers for components and car, you know, like the dashboards
[59:08.920 --> 59:14.800]  of cards or stuff like that. Um, so supposedly a great material, uh, would be, will be interesting
[59:14.800 --> 59:19.440]  to see how it wears and you might think, Hey, well duh, of course it's going to wear well.
[59:19.440 --> 59:23.080]  Why would they use it if it doesn't wear well? But you know, then you think about the member
[59:23.080 --> 59:29.760]  of the iPod touch that, yep, that would serve an iPod touch. It was an iPod nano or something
[59:29.760 --> 59:34.240]  that was like, you could be scratch it with your fingernail. Yeah, no, totally. You can't.
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.160]  It's hard to, there's no amount of Q and a that can prepare you for a million customers
[59:37.160 --> 59:41.040]  hitting your product. So we'll see. But that's a, that's new. I don't, I don't recall ever
[59:41.040 --> 59:48.540]  seeing a premium laptop that was something other than aluminum or, uh, you know, plastic
[59:48.540 --> 59:52.960]  as the surface. Uh, they said they wanted it to be less sterile, to be less cold, to
[59:52.960 --> 59:56.600]  be more like a warmer feeling. I just thought, ah, that's going to pick up a lot of stains
[59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.240]  and a lot of good dirt. At least the lighter colors would, I think. I don't know. Um, but
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.920]  I mean the argument I guess is that it's going to patina like a good leather. I don't know,
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.240]  but it's a fancy way of saying to stay. Yeah, but it's weird though. I think things that
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:15.120]  patina by touch are different than things like if you have like a leather watch strap
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:23.360]  or a leather belt, it will get, get a patina over time, but it doesn't look like too sweaty
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.720]  palm print. Yes. Right. No. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's coming from use as opposed
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.480]  to coming from just sweat on two spots. Right. Right on the palm rest. And those are heavily
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.560]  used. I mean that's heavy traffic area. Yeah. So we'll see, you know, but, but give them
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.680]  credit for something original and looks pretty good, but I don't think the price is all that
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.400]  compelling. I mean, I don't think it's bad, but I don't, I don't get the argument that
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.320]  it makes Apple's Mac book pricing look out of line. No, like the, the, the one thing
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.240]  you could criticize Apple for is that at $99, $999, they do not have a retina computer there.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.840]  The Mac book air is still a non retina machine, although it does have an available wide variety
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.640]  of ports than this machine does. But for people who always wanted a retina Mac book air, the
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.840]  Mac book pro escape is not quite that. And this is closer. Right. And that is the take.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.440]  You know, there were a couple of tweets along the lines of, you know, this is the Mac book
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.360]  air that Apple, the retina Mac book air that Apple never made. And you can kind of see
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.200]  that in, in, you know, squinting your eyes. And that's sort of basically what it is. It's
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.760]  the wedge shape. It's 13 inches display. It has a retina display. It's got the core I
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.960]  five and core I seven chip sets as opposed to the Intel M three M five and seven chips
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.200]  that, that the Mac book has. Yeah. Which I still don't like. I mean, whenever those chips
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.160]  see my iPad pro, they just cry. It's, you know, that's the truth. I mean, for people
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.160]  who don't pay attention to those specs and I know some of, you know, some of you people
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.120]  listening, you obviously do, but I think a lot of you probably don't, but you know, the,
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.160]  the Mac book, the one port Mac book that we have today is very, very, very similar conceptually
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.400]  to the original when the iPod air, when the iPad air, not iPad air Mac book air first
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:14.360]  came out where it was not priced based on performance. Right. That's the, you know,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:20.360]  the, and in traditional computer thinking, you spend more to get a faster computer and
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.520]  you spend less and you get a slower computer by some, you know, by some multiple measures
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:33.480]  often of speed, IO, CPU graphics, you name it, you spend more, you get faster, you spend
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.840]  less, you get slower. And the Mac book air was a dramatic exception to that where the
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:44.320]  Mac book air was a lot more expensive and a lot slower. But what you got was something
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.680]  remarkably thinner and lighter, you know, famously taken out of a Manila envelope by
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.000]  Steve jobs on stage to announce it to gasps outright gasps from the audience. They could,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.920]  the appeal was immediate, but in terms of how is it priced, it was very different. It
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.600]  was a premium price product, even though the performance was far behind a Mac book pro
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.680]  like far less expensive computers. The Mac book today is sort of like that. The difference
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.400]  isn't as dramatic. It's not super expensive. You know, I think what does it start at 1299
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:20.840]  when a reasonable config is, I would say around 15, $1,600 but it's slower than a $999 Mac
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840]  book air.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.400]  Yeah. And I think it's also, if you actually look at that computer, the components that
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.800]  Apple used in that are expensive and it's a really bad analogy, but they delivered futuristic
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.560]  computer technology in the present and that's always expensive. And I remember sort of asking
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.880]  like why it was this price and it seemed overpriced and I got this a gas sort of look and then
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.080]  I got a very behind the scenes rundown of what actually went into make it like that
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.440]  display is incredibly sophisticated and a lot of technology they had to invent to make
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.780]  that computer the way it is incredibly expensive and sophisticated. And you could argue that
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.720]  they don't need to do that kind of thing. And I think we'll see that again with the
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.520]  iPhone eight when it ships that it's going to be more expensive than the current iPhones,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.640]  but because the technology they're putting in it would otherwise not come to market for
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.600]  a couple of years. And that's the cost of bringing that stuff forward sooner.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.040]  So you really, we're skipping ahead, but you really think that they're going to, they're
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.160]  going to ship an iPhone pro or X or eight or something that actually raises the prices
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.280]  from the current iPhone seven and seven plus prices.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.500]  Yeah, I think the seven, I mean, I think they saw that there's price elasticity when they
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:25.280]  made the iPhone seven plus 20 bucks more than previous iPhone seven, sorry, the previous
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.800]  iPhone plus. And that's going to carry forward. And when they started introducing things like
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.960]  it's always a balancing act. If we want to put something like distance charging in, if
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.580]  we want to put a much better camera system in, if we want to put much better screen technology,
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.840]  all of these things have a cost and they'll come down over time. But if we do it today,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.360]  it's going to be this price. If we do it next year or the year after, it's going to be this
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.320]  price. And once in a while I think they're going to gamble and say, we can afford to
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.480]  test the upper limits of iPhone pricing. Yeah. And the other factor that comes into
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:56.620]  that is that they can, they can not have to bank on having 70 million of those components
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:59.040]  in the first three months. Oh yeah, it controls demand and the price
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.840]  is higher, less people want it. And then the constraint supplies don't matter as much.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.080]  I think if that's going to be their strategy with the iPhone, which I don't think, I don't
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.800]  think they would call the iPhone eight. I really don't. I think they would call it the
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:16.440]  iPhone pro, but or an iPhone something. And there, cause I think, I think, and then if
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.920]  they also have iPhone seven S and iPhone seven S plus that stay at these same prices we know
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:27.680]  today and just do a typical S upgrade, which is often, if not usually a better upgrade
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:34.120]  component wise than the non S years. Um, I think calling the new one, the iPhone
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:41.280]  eight makes the iPhone seven S look older than it would if they gave it a non-numbered
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.280]  name. I think iPhone edition was the other, it's
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.120]  funny cause in Mac book was Mac book stealth originally and then they just went with Mac
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.680]  book. Right. So they can play around with those things until they just make a last minute
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.000]  decision. Right. And those things, the leak the least
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.560]  because that's the, you know, they don't print the names on the devices so they don't come
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.640]  out of the, you know, like you look on the back of your iPhone seven, it doesn't say
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.440]  iPhone seven. It just says iPhone. Um, and so that, you know, it's just a small number
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:12.720]  of product marketing people who do not do not leak. Uh, so anyway, anyway, uh, back
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:19.960]  to, back to surface laptop. Uh, the other thing, so the other, the flip side of the
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:26.100]  event was the software, which was windows 10 S, which is, uh, and again, the comparisons
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.840]  were all to Apple. Apple was so, it's fascinating to me as somebody who's been following this
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:39.800]  stuff obsessively, you know, for mine, you know, I was a teenager, uh, is absolutely
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.920]  fascinating to me how central Apple is to this entire announcement, both software, everything
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.160]  was compared, everything on the hardware was compared to the Mac book and everything software
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:57.640]  was compared to, uh, iOS and Mac OS. Um, but the big news, there's a windows 10 assets,
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:07.720]  a cut down version of windows 10 and it is iOS style in some ways where, um, apps can
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:14.840]  only come from the windows app store. Uh, and to get out of that, it's not like the
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:21.080]  Mac where you can click a checkbox and you know, there's, or there's a radio button in
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:25.040]  the Mac and the security thing where you can choose allow. Yeah, the gatekeeper switch
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.320]  allow apps only from the app store or allow apps from the app store and from, um, known
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:37.920]  identified developers. Um, and you can also, you know, even with that check, you can also
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.680]  use apps from unsigned developers, but you have to be nerdy enough to know that to open
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.520]  them by not just by double clicking them, you have to like control click and choose
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.600]  open or use the gear menu in the finder just to double ensure that you know exactly what
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.480]  you're getting into in terms of using an app from an untrusted developer. So you can do
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.760]  that on the Mac. The windows 10 assets like iOS where the old, there is no option. There
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.800]  are no options like that. There's no options to get apps from side load apps from outside
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:13.840]  the store from known developers and certainly no options to, to get unsigned apps. Yeah.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.160]  You have to pro your way out of it. It's a huge, huge deal. I mean, it's the sort of
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.640]  thing that like if Microsoft had tried it 10 years ago would have had antitrust. That
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.540]  was a suspicion. Like when the Mac app store was first announced, there was a whole bunch
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.820]  of people who panicked immediately and said that we're one step away from Apple locking
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.720]  down the Mac where they locked out iOS and this is just the first stage and Apple has
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.280]  thus far not done it at all. And it's, it's interesting that Microsoft got there first.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.840]  Right. Because that's everybody's fear. And, and I highlighted a tweet on during Fireball
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:50.360]  from Dieter Bohn of the Verge who said that, you know, Apple, you know, Microsoft's the
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.280]  first dish, I might be paraphrasing, but Microsoft's the first, Microsoft ships a completely locked
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:01.560]  down computer before Apple. Odd. Which I thought was interesting just because it's, you know,
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.120]  when he's talking about a computer, it's clear that what he means is that he only thinks
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.800]  of Macs as real computers and not iPads because the iPad's been out since 2011 and has been
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.160]  locked down the exact same way the whole time. Yeah. Other changes that they've done that
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:24.300]  are even tighter than Apple's iOS restrictions in some ways are with web browsers. You can
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:29.320]  download other web browsers, but only from the store and Chrome is not in the store.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.480]  It was at one point, so it might return, but my understanding I've poked ass around was
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.760]  more or less that when Microsoft went to Google and said, hey, with the version of Chrome
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.160]  in the Windows app store, you're turning it into Chrome OS, you know, that it was, you
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.440]  know, had its own app store. It did again, circling back to our discussion of Apple and
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.720]  apps that have quote unquote apps within apps. They were like, knock it off. And so rather
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:59.920]  than sort of take out that Chrome OS style integration of quote apps within Chrome, Google
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:08.560]  just took the ball and went home. But even if you do get a browser from their app store,
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.160]  you can't set it as your default. So like an email, if you get an email with a URL in
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:18.600]  it and click it, it's always going to open in Edge. And here's the part that would have
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.560]  been so much more interesting if they had done this years ago and if they had done it
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:30.560]  in Windows itself is the search feature in Edge is Bing and only Bing, and you have no
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.840]  other options. So unlike, let's say, even iOS, which is pretty locked down, you get
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.560]  Google search by default still, but you have the option for Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:47.480]  Yeah, it's, I mean, it's hard to take things away from people, and I think the expectations
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.680]  are different. With iOS, the expectation has always been that you've never been able to
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.480]  have third-party rendering engines, which means you've never been able to, you've always
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:00.080]  been able to change your default browser. And with Microsoft, they're calling this Windows.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.720]  It feels like Windows. It looks like Windows. Those features now feel taken away. You've
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.060]  taken away my ability to get Chrome. You've taken away my ability to search with Google
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.240]  rather than being a feature of the operating system.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.000]  Yeah, it's interesting. I'm intrigued to see how it plays out because I don't know who
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.240]  the market is for this exactly. And there is an option, last but not least, there's
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:25.980]  an option where you can get this, if you buy, I guess, any of these Windows 10 S devices,
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:33.340]  if you pay 50 bucks, you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. But it's clear. It's not just like
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:39.360]  you're paying 50 bucks to toggle a checkbox. Like, you're changing the OS in certain ways.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.240]  It's not like GitKeeper where you can turn it off, download the app you want, turn it
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.400]  back on. It's not like you can download Windows Pro, get Chrome, and go to Windows S.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.880]  You know, and I don't know enough about Windows to say for sure, but it's clear that the difference
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:57.560]  between Windows 10 S and Windows 10 Pro is more like, it's two different versions of
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.940]  Windows 10 and there's obviously a lot of shared stuff in there. And it's not like the
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:08.320]  difference between iOS and macOS where it's two entirely different operating systems.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.460]  One Windows.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:14.400]  But they did advertise repeatedly during the event that Windows 10 S, like there is, you
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.200]  know, that they don't call, I forget what they call it, but they don't call it sandboxing.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:26.840]  But there's the equivalent idea of sandboxing where apps from the Windows store, you know,
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.840]  can't do it like the old days where you can do it right all over the file system and add
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:37.960]  DLLs to the system level, blah, blah, blah. They repeatedly said that as you use a Windows
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.040]  10 S device over time, it won't slow down, which is, you know, again, I haven't used
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.240]  Windows on a regular basis in, I don't know, 10 or 15 years, but it was always true. And
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.000]  as far as I have heard recently, it's still true that if, you know, people can't, nobody
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.480]  who's like an expert Windows user gets a Windows machine and four years later is still
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.040]  using it without having reinstalled at some point just to clean out the gunk.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.480]  Yeah, it's, yeah, it's super interesting to me the, a lot of the choices that they
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.680]  made with this operating system. And are they competing? It's clear they're competing
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.040]  with Apple in some aspects, but they're also competing with Chrome and Chrome OS and the
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.360]  growth of Chrome OS in schools. And Chrome OS is the virtue is like the Chromebooks
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.240]  are super, super cheap. Chrome OS is essentially free. Chrome services, Google services are
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.400]  essentially free, makes it an incredibly easy to manage environment, which education, you
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.480]  know, schools, everybody loves. And is Windows S really an answer to that? Is a way to get
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.720]  a super cheap free version of Windows onto a bunch of super cheap, really inexpensive
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:44.000]  laptops. I think the Surface laptop aside, a lot of the third party Surface laptop style
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  machines will be much less expensive, but that, that brings with it a whole other sense
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.640]  of, sorry, a whole other set of concessions or compromises.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:58.960]  I get the impression that at a, at a practical level and from their business, they're, what
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:05.240]  they really need to be concentrating on is Chrome and Chromebooks. And in, you know,
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.480]  they announced that they have through their, nothing Microsoft branded, but through their
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.240]  partners, OEMs, like I think Acer and a couple of others, that they're coming out with $189
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.640]  notebooks that run Windows 10 S, which is, you know, pretty, pretty good price point.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.120]  And clearly, you know, very specifically the event was education theme marked at the education
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:34.760]  market. The, the Surface laptop is clearly not aimed at the, that part of the education
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:40.880]  market, the tray full of laptops for kids to, you know, grade school kids to get as
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.680]  they come in the school. There is though, you know, it's sort of, it's still quote
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:53.200]  unquote education, but it's, there's the like teenagers who are going to own their own computer
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:15:00.420]  for high school and college. And it's, that's where Apple thrives, right? Like, so Apple,
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:04.640]  because their prices are so much higher and because Chrome, you know, for various reasons,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.840]  Chrome has really, really taken off in the classroom education market.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:15.360]  Yeah. And it's kind of interesting to see if it repeats because when I was young, there
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.120]  was, you know, a lot of us had Apple computers, but you'd go to schools and sometimes they
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.000]  would have PC computing labs because they were cheap and all you'd hear is kids go,
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.360]  ah, I hate this. My Mac at home is so much nicer. And I wonder if we're going to get
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.720]  to the point where, because schools are regimented the way that they are, there's a bunch of
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.360]  cheap Windows S and probably a lot more Chromebooks and kids will go in and go, ah, this is not
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.640]  like the iPad I have at home. You know, I hate it. And that's sort of builds a whole
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.960]  separate cliche, a cache where maybe Apple isn't as competitive in the schools anymore,
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.040]  but they're super competitive in the homes with the same sort of population.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.640]  Yeah, I think it's definitely true as the father of a seventh grader. And in seventh
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.480]  grade it's a little different, but in, in the lower grades, just in the last few years
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.120]  at Jonas's school, most of the computers that they had access to were Chromebooks.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:06.080]  And the kids hated them, but they're not hated them, but they, they, they didn't really
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.840]  see them as something desirable. Hate's a wrong word, but they more or less were just,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:14.320]  they're just Google docs machines. Really. That's really all they were. And you know,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.200]  I guess they do some research on, you know, web browsers, but they're just literally just
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:25.920]  used for searching the web for some amount of research and for, you know, writing. If
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.880]  you had a written assignment, you do it in Google docs and it saves to a folder where
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.540]  the teacher can get it.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.800]  And they're kind of junky and they're kind of squeaky and they're kind of mushy. It's
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.200]  just like, cause Microsoft is the same way. They have Chrome at school now. So they went
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.080]  all in on it, but they have iPads at home and they can tell, like, it's not, they don't
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.800]  put it in those terms, but they can tell that it just feel like a sub, like they're not
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800]  the same experience.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.640]  Right. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. And I totally understand it from the school's
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.840]  perspective because I don't, you know, that they don't think, you know, you don't want
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:01.240]  a more expensive, you know, the price is a huge issue and durability is a huge issue.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.720]  And if you can combine it and have a device that at least is reasonably rugged and even
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:12.320]  if it does break, it's only $180 to replace or whatever. I totally get it. But, but the
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.200]  kids, like the mind share of the kids on what they actually use and wanted to use was, you
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:21.200]  know, uh, in their own time was iPhones. Really.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.640]  I think that's an important part of the discussion in the overall education market.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.960]  Yeah. Um, but the surface laptop clearly is, is aimed, I feel like from a business sense
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:35.480]  app, Microsoft really needs to stem the growth of Chromebooks. They need that market. They
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.800]  need that, you know, their, their business is set up on the assumption that all of these
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.920]  low end machines will be running windows and we'll figure out a way to make money even
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:48.800]  if the margins are really low, that that's, you know, that windows everywhere strategy
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.080]  is important to them. I feel like it's more of a psychological pride thing that they are
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.320]  in for years now. It's not just with the surface laptop, but that they've sort of been, not
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.120]  even sort of that they've been outright gunning for the Mac book in advertising with their
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:12.400]  products, right? They had a whole ad campaign based on the, I forget the name of their products,
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.080]  but I think it's the surface book surface pro and the surface surface pro. I don't know,
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.320]  but it's the first one that was the convertible tablet and then surface book was the laptop
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:26.160]  be convertible, right? So the laptop be convertible. There's an ad campaign that was pretty big
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.200]  where they ran and it, the whole thing was based on, can't do this on a Mac book and
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:35.800]  it's usually just drawing or touching the screen. I'm trying to make that look, we've
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:42.600]  made a high quality laptop and it has a touch screen trying to make that into an end differentiating
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.600]  issue and they, they mentioned, you know, in that campaign they mentioned Mac books
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.560]  specifically and nothing else. I mean, and they can't really mention anything else because
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.880]  it's, it's not targeted at Chromebooks. It's a very different, these are different
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.040]  class machine. These are like the thousand dollar range machine and they can't piss
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.040]  off their OEMs by talking about other windows laptops.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.280]  Yeah, it feels like Microsoft is caught in a hard, it's sort of caught in the middle
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.360]  right now and you have Apple at one side and Google the other side and Microsoft is sort
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.920]  of running back and forth between them. Not really certain of its own identity, sometimes
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.120]  competing with Google, sometimes with Apple. And I don't want to bring up the toaster
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.520]  fridge thing, but I think it's an app description of, it's sort of, it sort of botches your
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.480]  focus with products because you, you're not, you don't have your own clear destination.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:28.160]  You're sort of like what Apple is doing over here, what Google is doing over here
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.480]  and you're meshing them together. And I think that's sort of the disconnect that
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.320]  I see in the surface book. Yeah. The surface laptop. Well, and the other thing too is that
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:43.920]  they, they tried to make some hay at the end of last year in the wake of the mixed reviews
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:53.080]  of the new MacBook pros. Um, and it said, you know, this is the end of 2016 that they,
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.720]  that, that I forget if they said their surface in particular or the, you know, that the premium
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.960]  market, which is defined as like nine 99 and up for laptops, that they're taking share
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.760]  away from Apple in that market. Um, and there were a couple of statements that they had,
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:12.760]  but it was all Bezos numbers where they didn't give specific numbers or sources and just
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:19.560]  set it. Um, but the actual numbers that have been released and were released since then,
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.000]  don't bear that out. Apple's Mac sales have been up and again, Apple doesn't in their
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.920]  numbers release the split between notebooks and desktops, but there's no reason to believe
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:33.200]  that their desktop sales are up because they're best selling one. The iMac is over a year
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:39.320]  old and there are other ones, the Mac pro and the Mac mini are, uh, 17 and 23 years
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:46.320]  old respectively. And even in the best desktop year, the, the laptops dwarf just dwarf the
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:52.600]  desktop sales. Uh, and so there's absolutely, you know, Apple's Mac sales are up the last
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.120]  two quarters they've reported. So there's absolutely no sign that that Mac sales are
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:03.240]  down. And so if there, if, if it's true that windows PCs in the premium market have taken
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:08.460]  share from Apple, it doesn't make any sense because if Apple's sales are up, technically
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.620]  it would be possible if the overall market were growing so fast that they could take
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:17.960]  share away even though Apple's still growing by outgrowing it. But absolutely no, nobody
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:24.740]  is reporting that premium windows laptop sales are a growing part of the market. In fact,
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:28.840]  everybody's reporting that there's, that it's a shrinking part of the market. Not collapsing,
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:36.640]  but you know, like a slowly deflating tire. Yes. And there's no sign of that. Uh, there's
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.360]  no sign of that, uh, a betting. Yeah. And it's, it's funny, uh, that w again, going
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.320]  back to the Apple watch thing, the Apple watch is considered beleaguered. It's considered
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:50.420]  doomed in a lot of the, the, the angles taken reports where surface was, you know, by no
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.040]  measure selling. Well, we had no idea what it was selling, but it was being ballooned.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.140]  It was being propped up. There were headlines all over the place saying how the resurgence
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:02.420]  of the windows laptop, uh, and the coverage of the numbers you talked about that had no
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.160]  backing from Microsoft. As far as I can tell though, that was pretty extensive and the
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.240]  coverage of the surface not doing well, it's not been similar. Right. They've just announced
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.580]  that this, you know, sales are not, not again, not collapsing, but the surface sales were
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.920]  down pretty significantly in the last quarter that they reported. So I don't see that happening.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:23.560]  Um, all right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show

[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:03.120]  slash talk show. My thanks to audible. Uh, I should point out when I say about, when
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.480]  I talk about the coverage, I don't mean that apple should be given a free ride on these
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.720]  things. I think it's the same thing as like when touch id is considered a disaster at
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.800]  launch, but the debauched facial recognition is fine. I think everybody should be scrutinized
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.080]  to the level that apple is. It's not that they should give apple a break, but they should
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.520]  hold everybody to that same standard because as a consumer, I want to know all that stuff
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:24.140]  when I make my decision on what I want to buy next. And I feel like I'm being underserved
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.300]  right now because I hear every little, all the hot takes about apple and everything else
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:33.840]  sort of just skates by. Yeah. Uh, well I think it's worth talking about the, the, the, the,
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.520]  the elephant in the room of apple's Mac book lineup is the Mac book air because it's, I
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.940]  think it's, I think I checked today, I think it's 788 days since they updated the specs.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:50.500]  So it's two years old. It still costs nine 99. It doesn't have a retina screen and, and
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:57.940]  you know, I, it's, it's the existence of that product that gives rise to the, Hey, Microsoft
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:02.740]  just put out this thing and it makes the Mac book lineup look overpriced. I don't think
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.440]  that's true. If you look at the, if you look at the Mac book and I, you know, the Mac book
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.060]  one port and I don't, even though it, I think we're probably due for an update on that cause
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.340]  the last one came out a year ago, but a year is not an unreasonable period of time to wait
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:20.660]  for an update. So if we get one at WWDC, I would say right on time. Um, Mac book pros
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:26.260]  obviously just came out last fall. Uh, and I think our, you know, I don't buy the argument
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:31.100]  that they're overpriced. I think for what they are, they are correctly priced, even
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:35.220]  though at certain price points that means that getting a quote unquote new Mac book
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:39.420]  pro has a higher price. It's the price of a Mac book pro plus the apple watch that's
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:45.320]  essentially embedded inside it. Right. Exactly. And, and I think that the, if you spec things
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:52.800]  out, like when I did the comparison to the, um, to the surface laptop, what I was configuring
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.420]  it against, I don't think I mentioned this, I was configuring it against the new Mac book
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:04.140]  pro with the buttons, not the touch bar, because that's to me the most apt comparison. Like
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:09.540]  to me, that is the Mac book air with retina that everybody claims that they want apple
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:14.760]  to make the Mac book air with, with, with a retina screen is the new Mac book pro that
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:21.420]  doesn't have the touch bar as much when you introduced it. Yeah. And, and he, well, yeah,
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.300]  it's so much in so many ways by comparing it to the size and weight and thickness of
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:29.820]  a Mac book air, which it compares very favorable, you know, it matches up with and it's way
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:37.340]  faster and has a beautiful screen and et cetera. Um, but the Mac book air is old and is sitting
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:41.780]  there at nine 99 and doesn't have a retina screen. And you know, not arguing, but just
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.940]  having a very, very nice debate with people on Twitter about it recently, like Marco Arment
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:50.400]  and Twitter made that point. And it's hard to argue with that in 2017 apple should not
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.500]  be selling any device that has a display that's not retina caliber in terms of resolution.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:01.120]  And I agree with that. In theory, that's, it's too, it's 2017 is too late to still be
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.680]  selling a brand new product that brand new, meaning that you're buying it out of the box
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:12.320]  and it's factory sealed price retail. Yeah. Right. Um, I think it's, you know, the non
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.300]  retina Mac book air is like the new 16 gigabyte iOS device. I can't defend it. I'm, I think
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.980]  it's, I would recommend against it. I would, if somebody asked me if they should buy one,
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.860]  I would say no. And that would be the reason why you pointed out so well with the Mac pro
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:29.380]  thing is that apple doesn't have a game plan for this. It's like if we don't have something
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.420]  new to announce and we're not canceling it, it just stays at exactly the same price in
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:39.340]  the catalog because they want to keep something at that nine 99 price that is a Mac laptop,
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:46.580]  but they feel like they can't sell the Mac book one port at that price yet and still
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:52.300]  keep the margins they want. Um, you know, I think what they're doing is waiting and,
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.820]  and I don't know if it's this year, I don't, I have no inside information, but my theory
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:02.040]  is what they will do is eventually they'll have an updated state of the art Mac book,
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:08.420]  just plain Mac book and put the year old just plain Mac book at a lower price point until
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.940]  it gets to nine 99 and then at that point the Mac book air goes away. Yeah. And I'll
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:16.580]  be a little sad if they stick to the mint, the Intel core M platform for that because
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.420]  it just, it's not the same. It's fanless, it's fanless, which is great, but it's just,
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:24.780]  I don't know how to get out of that though. Cause I don't, you can't use a core. I don't,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:28.460]  I don't know. You know, I think you're, I think you're stuck waiting for the, for the,
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:32.780]  the M series to get fast enough that you don't mind. I mean, and it can happen. I mean, you
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:39.360]  know, the, the eight 10 is a fanless design and you know, it's fast. That's the other
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:47.300]  thing that's sort of great about the Mac book is that the iPad pro in, in my opinion has
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:52.500]  a faster CPU. I think that the, you know, the single core geek bench scores are a reasonable,
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:57.500]  you know, I realized that they don't correlate exactly to real world use and their purpose
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.500]  built.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.660]  So the two things that, you know, right off the bat is that Apple can build those cores
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.380]  exactly for what they want. So they can have super fast single threaded operations because
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:07.940]  that's what people hit when they do interface and stuff like that. But they can all, I remember
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:12.540]  the initial review unit I had for the second generation Mac book, it could barely handle
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:17.340]  one stream of 4k. Well, while the, the a nine, not even the eight 10 version of the iPad
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.440]  pro, there is no eight 10 version yet. The nine version of the iPad pro could handle
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:24.420]  three streams of 4k because Apple built that chip exactly to do that. And they don't have
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:28.500]  control over Intel and Intel will do things like the, as far as I can tell, the core M3
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.980]  is a hot, a deliberately hobbled chip that maybe Apple shouldn't use, but Intel just
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:37.100]  makes it worse than the M5 just because they want a lower price point for that chip set.
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:41.680]  So you know, there's, you know, there's a waiting game involved there. And because part
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.740]  of it, I think too, is like you just alluded to is some, a big part of it is out of Apple's
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:51.940]  hands where they were waiting for Intel. And that opens the door to the whole mill. Maybe
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.860]  they'll go, you know, put an arm chip, you know, their own custom arm chip in a Mac.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:01.060]  By AMD, they have all this money. Right. And who knows, who knows what they're thinking,
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.940]  but it's, you know, switching to arm on one model of Mac is a lot more complicated than
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:11.960]  we have time to discuss. And I don't think it's going to happen. And therefore you know,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.260]  there might be something I don't foresee. There might be some way out of this, but basically
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:18.300]  they're waiting for Intel on that. So I don't know. I don't know. You know, I don't know
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:23.500]  what to say. And I, but I, I can totally see, I wouldn't also wouldn't recommend that Apple,
[01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.100]  you know, update the MacBook Air and put it right in the screen in there.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.660]  Yeah. It feels like there's something, and there were rumors of a device in between that
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:36.500]  was sort of a larger version of that was a 14 inch Mac or something. It hasn't shipped.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.500]  Right.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.260]  There's no Kaby Lake version of the Mac book. There's no 14 inch version of the Mac book.
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.420]  There's just, then the updated iMac's not here yet.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:50.260]  Yeah. Yeah. The 14 inch Mac book was a weird, that was a weird rumor that some people seem
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:31:00.980]  certain of and never shipped. Anyway, let's move on. WWDC stuff. I just quickly want to
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:05.860]  say, I am having a live show. It's announced. I, people keep asking about tickets soon.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.820]  As you listen to this, it will be very soon. We are moving. But I don't have anything to
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:19.940]  announce yet. So patience. Sorry. There are a couple of other events. I know that they're
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:23.780]  on the same webpage on Apple's WWDC. They're very, very, it's very, very nice of Apple
[01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:29.640]  to promote these alternative, or I won't forget what they call them, but community events.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.900]  There is a CocoConf taking place in a hotel right adjacent to the convention center that
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:40.820]  is where WWDC is. CocoConf is held a couple of times a year. I've never been, but I have
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:45.780]  friends who've spoken there and have attended and swear up and down that it is an amazing
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:51.620]  conference. It's like a $12.99 conference for developers. They have a great speaker
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:58.100]  lineup. They'll be right there next to WWDC. So I think CocoConf is a great plan B for
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:04.300]  people who wanted to go to WWDC and lost the lottery for tickets. So look into that if
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.580]  you're a developer and you want something like that. There's AltConf, which is also
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:13.620]  in a hotel adjacent to the convention hall. I've never been there, but it seems to me
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:19.100]  like there's two hotels that are literally connected to the convention center and that
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:24.620]  those hotels themselves have convention space. So one of them is a CocoConf. The other one
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:31.480]  is AltConf. AltConf is free, so that's a great option if you're not looking to spend money.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.100]  I think it's also sort of developer-oriented. And then last but not least, in fact, last
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:42.700]  but probably the opposite least is the Layers Conference, which is a great, great, great
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:47.980]  conference. It's more design-oriented. It's not a developer conference. So for those of
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:52.620]  you who aren't interested in design or in development, you're not coders, but you're
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:58.540]  a designer. It is a great conference. It was two years ago where I got to interview Susan
[01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:03.460]  Kerr, the designer of the original Macintosh icons and all the original Macintosh fonts,
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:12.220]  which is still maybe the most I-can't-believe-I'm-doing-this moment of my entire career. Having Phil Schiller
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:17.380]  on the talk show or whatever was a thrill, and meeting Steve Jobs was a thrill. But for
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:22.220]  me personally, not necessarily thrilling, but just like, I can't believe I'm doing this.
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:27.180]  Interviewing Susan Kerr on stage was just absolutely amazing because she's just one
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:36.340]  of my favorite designers of all time. It was as famous to me as Steve Jobs was at a very
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:39.860]  young age because I knew that she did all of this amazing work, almost single-handedly
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:46.140]  on the original Mac, and it was all down to the pixel, just perfect. That was great. But
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.060]  the speakers there, it's great, and it's so, so nice. Layers is just one of those conferences
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:54.180]  where it's like, I cannot believe that once a year these people put together a conference
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:57.560]  for everything that's so nice, and you get nice coffee, and it's a nice room, and stuff
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.020]  like that. So I have a special deal for people who listen to the talk show. You go to layers.is.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.740]  That's the website, or you can just Google for Layers Conference, but the website is
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:12.260]  layers.is. And if you use this code, you'll save 100 bucks on registration. And I know
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.300]  they're doing pretty well, but there's definitely still openings. And if you're going to go,
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:22.260]  if you're thinking about having an excuse to be in the WWDC area during WWDC, you're
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.860]  going to want to book stuff. Now's the time to book, so you're not making arrangements
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:31.540]  at the last minute. You will save 100 bucks, and here's the code you can use that they'll
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.860]  know you came from me. This is not a sponsorship. This is something I'm doing as a friend to
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:40.580]  Jesse Char who runs the conference, and because I wholeheartedly recommend it. This isn't
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:46.540]  a sponsorship, but it's just a great conference. So you save 100 bucks, here's the code, martini.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:55.720]  Use that code. And I worked it out. I added test it. You can also get the same code, same
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:02.860]  discount if you type the martini emoji. I dare you to try it. I think it'll work.
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.860]  Perfect. That's perfect.
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:09.620]  Isn't that perfect? I hope it works. Try that out. Layers.is. It is such a good conference,
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.500]  and it's such a great... I think it's going to be pretty exciting. I don't know. Who knows?
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.780]  This whole thing could be weird, but if you're thinking about it, if you're hoping to make
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:21.560]  last minute... I was just talking to somebody else today who was on the fence about whether
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:28.500]  they are going to be... Can they get to San Jose for WWDC week? So I know that there's
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.180]  people out there who are still thinking maybe they will, maybe they won't, but if you want
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:36.220]  to have a good reason to be there, Layers is as good as anything.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:40.300]  Yeah. And if you're a designer, it's a perfect conference, WWDC, because I know every year
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.960]  they try more and more to have more and more design sessions, and they have the design
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.020]  review labs, but it's really a developer show, and Layers is such a great complement to it.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:53.060]  Yeah. And I forget what else they do. There's some integrations with WWDC where Apple people
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.700]  come and do talk about interface design and stuff like that. So check out their website.
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:02.660]  It has all the info. Also, I just love the Layers logo this year. It is so great because
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:08.380]  it is self-referential to the name where it's very design looking. Anyway, check out their
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.980]  website even if you're not interested in a conference just to see the excellent graphic
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:15.740]  design.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:20.540]  What else do you got? There was the... We didn't talk about it, but the... We mentioned
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:25.460]  it before, but we didn't go into it. The whole thing with Uber tagging iPhones.
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:28.740]  You can tell it's an interesting week for Uber when they have not one but two controversies
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.580]  on the same day.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:31.580]  What was the other one?
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.780]  I heard you had them both in your original write-off.
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.780]  I don't remember.
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:38.580]  Yeah. And now he's canceled his recoding.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:46.300]  That had to happen. There was no way that he could possibly get up there. I almost wish
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:51.060]  what they should have done is Kickstarter just like, all right, I'll do it, but we've
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:57.700]  got to Kickstarter a million dollars for AppCamp for girls or some good cause like that. Can
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:02.060]  you imagine how much money you would have raised to get Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.020]  to skewer him on stage? Oh, my God.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:09.540]  But anyway, the story came out. Mike Isaac of the New York Times had a story in a profile
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:18.400]  of Kalanick, the CEO, co-founder of Uber, and mentioned that a couple of years ago,
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:26.620]  he got called in for a meeting with Tim Cook at Apple's campus. Cook confronted him with
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:32.260]  the fact that Apple had figured out that they were, and this is where the story was, Mirkya
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:35.460]  initially, where the initial version of the story that was up in the New York Times in
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:42.700]  the morning said that they were tagging and tracking iPhones, even after the app was deleted
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:49.780]  or even if the OS was erased from the phone and reset. And then the word tracking was
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:56.900]  taken out in a subsequent edit in the afternoon, but the horses were out of the barn at that
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.180]  point where people were panicked. And part of it is rightfully fueled by, well, Uber
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:06.340]  has been caught with so many shady practices that if they could do that, of course they
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:10.860]  would. It passes the sniff test of this, if Apple...
[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.860]  Yes, it's believable.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:16.060]  Right. But there was no tracking, meaning you hear tracking phones and you think, well,
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.580]  I had the Uber app, and if I have the Uber app, it can use my location because that's
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:26.220]  how the car comes and gets you. And so you hear that, and what people think is, well,
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:30.580]  I deleted the Uber app because I don't like the company, I've used Lyft, or for whatever
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:35.420]  reason, they deleted the app, and the fear that Uber is still tracking them and doing
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:41.460]  something like figuring out if they're using Lyft, even if you don't have the app. And
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:44.780]  if you know iOS, you'd know, well, that sounds like it should be impossible because when
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:50.880]  an app is deleted, you can't do things like you could do on traditional PCs, like sneakily
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:57.180]  put a background process in a system directory, so even if your app is deleted, you've still
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:01.780]  got this remnant of you behind. That's the whole point of these containers that apps
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:06.500]  ship in now, is that when you delete the app as a user, just hold the app, make it jiggle,
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:13.620]  hit the X, anything it could run on your phone is gone. But that's not what they were doing.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:17.060]  I think basically, we're still not sure exactly what was going on, but basically they were
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:21.540]  quote unquote fingerprinting the phone, and they were figuring out a way to get a uniquely
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:26.020]  identify a phone, phoning that home to Uber so they could store it.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:29.820]  Yeah, it's not like they were just essentially fingerprinting it and then using that fingerprint
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.740]  as a way to tell when the same device was re-accessing the service.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.540]  Right, I lost my train of thought there, but that's exactly right. And it was to counter
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.660]  some sort of fraud that was going on in China, where I think basically the story was that
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:45.300]  they had a promotion to get people to start using Uber, where you could get a free ride
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:51.060]  if you're new to Uber. And if you're a driver and you pick up one of these free rides, you
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:57.460]  still get the credit as a driver. Uber, the corporation, is eating the free ride, not
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:02.820]  the drivers, because drivers would rightly revolt. So what drivers were doing is setting
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:07.860]  up some kind of scam where they would get stolen iPhones and configure them as new and
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.820]  put the Uber app on and get the free ride and pick them up. Like me and you could work
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:17.300]  as a team and I'll pick you up with the free thing and drop you off. And then you
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:23.500]  erase the phone and put it on all over and pretend to be somebody new and get another
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:29.700]  free ride and I pick you up and somehow bilking them out of free rides like that.
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:35.340]  And so if they could uniquely identify the phone, I guess it did actually allow them
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:38.460]  to sort of block that sort of thing where they could tell, hey, this phone's collected
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:40.860]  free rides twice already. Forget it.
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:47.020]  And Uber is not the kind of company that lets regulations get in the way of them doing business.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:53.580]  So the basic story, and again, it certainly did not seem to come from Apple's side. It
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:59.740]  seemed to more likely come from somebody on Uber's side. But the gist was that Tim
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:03.340]  Cook supposedly told them, hey, so knock it off. And they did.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:06.620]  Oh, and the other thing that they had was that they somehow knew that Apple might look
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:12.220]  at this in app review. And they put, at Kalanick's request, put a geofence around Apple's
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:19.220]  campus so that when the Uber app was running within X distance of Cupertino, it wouldn't
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.780]  do the fingerprinting.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:26.900]  It's remarkable to me that a company that is based on such geolocation technology would
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:31.020]  not think about Apple having other offices. Like, whoa, Sunnyvale, what are they doing?
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.900]  Oh, San Francisco, what's happening with Uber? Oh, Boston, what's going on here?
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:40.140]  I don't know if it's hubris or naivete or some mixture of both.
[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:46.140]  Well, both, but I think hubris, largely an arrogance. And the outrage on Twitter, and
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:52.820]  in a moral sense, it was correct, was why in the world does Tim Cook give Uber, hey,
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:58.740]  knock it off, slap on the wrist, and give them a chance to just remove this and stay
[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:08.540]  in the app store when other apps, again, if me and you jointly together make an app or
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:13.260]  put a new version of Esper out, and it tags and identifies phones, they're just going
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.340]  to kick the app out of the app store.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:26.100]  I get it. I see that in a certain moral sense, I see the argument there, or justice sense,
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:30.580]  that it doesn't seem fair that a small guy would get kicked out and a big company, let
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:35.860]  alone a big company full of jerks like Uber, gets to stay in. But that's the way the
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:42.220]  world works, right? Like, Uber has some, you know, has more stature because it's a super
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:47.580]  popular app that iPhone users use. And in some ways, yes, it's up, you know, Apple's
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:54.740]  doing the right thing by making, identifying this and making it stop. But our iPhone users
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:43:01.380]  as a whole, all, you know, however many hundred million of them there are, happier or sadder
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.860]  if Uber is literally kicked out of the app store.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:06.660]  Yeah, and Apple has to be, I mean, it's the same thing, the discussion we had with
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:09.980]  Facebook earlier where Apple has to be pragmatic about these things. They have a certain amount
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:13.180]  of, like, you have to weight these things. They can't all be done on a strict black
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:17.140]  and white scale because that sounds great in the abstract but doesn't work in life.
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:20.540]  And we make those decisions all the time. We, as much as we'll be upset that Apple's
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.660]  not doing things fairly or morally, we have the same problem when we're dealing with
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.780]  our client or the same issues when we're dealing with different people in our lives.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:30.060]  It's that, you know, these companies are all not, they're not equal. There are companies
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:33.420]  which Apple has beholden. There are companies which Apple has absolutely no interest in.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.900]  And there are companies where maybe Uber is like this, where they sort of both need each
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.940]  other. And it would be devastating for Uber to be off of the iPhone, but it would hurt
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.300]  Apple considerably to have Uber off the iPhone as well.
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:47.780]  Yeah, I think, and I don't know, you know, I don't know the backstory on this. I don't
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:50.940]  even know how much of it is technically, you know, exactly what happened. It's all from
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.300]  this one Mike Isaac story and doesn't seem like anybody's gotten a follow up. But what
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:59.060]  I would have liked to have seen is not for Apple to have kicked Uber out of the store.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:04.740]  I really, from a pragmatic standpoint, I understand why that, you know, I mean, I think it might
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:08.300]  have happened if Kyle Ennick had said to Tim Cook, screw you, we're going to keep doing
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.020]  it. You know, I mean, there's a certain, you know, all right, you know, you get called
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:15.700]  into the principal and maybe the principal gives you another chance, but you can't give
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:20.700]  the principal the finger, right? Yeah. But I think what Apple, what I would have liked
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.580]  to seen them do if everything that we know about this, we think we know about the story
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:30.740]  is true is I think that they should have made Uber disclose what they'd been doing in exact
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.300]  detail and say, here's the information we were collecting about phones. Here's how we
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.500]  did it. And, you know, you know, you have our word that we've deleted our database of
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:45.820]  these identifiers. And if they refuse, then I think Apple should have disclosed it. I
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:50.460]  the part that is doesn't sit right with me from what Apple did is that Apple knew that
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:54.140]  they were doing this. They knew that their customers had had their phones fingerprinted
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:45:03.860]  by Uber and Apple was apparently willing to, um, to let that go unknown. I mean, there's
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:08.300]  a chance that maybe Apple did do something, which is that maybe Apple, somebody at Apple
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:13.520]  was the source for Mike Isaac for that story. And that by leaking that that was their way
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:19.040]  of disclosing that that's what Uber had done. But I would have liked to have seen them do
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.260]  it in a way that's on the record, even if it was Apple, who was somebody at Apple, who
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:26.420]  was the anonymous source for that. I still think that there should have been some sort
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.180]  of official acknowledgement that this went on, even though I don't think it was all that
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.580]  gross of a privacy violation in the grand scheme of privacy violations.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:38.140]  Yeah. So I think, you know, if, if Uber had been literally tracking people, I think it
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:42.660]  would have forced a much greater response from Apple or a much more public response
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.540]  from Apple, because there's some offenses that are just so egregious that there's no
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:50.500]  other alternative. But this to me is, and again, this is a horrible analogy, but if
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:53.540]  like Grenada does something the U S doesn't like, they can literally just drop in, take
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:57.380]  over the airport and do whatever they want. It doesn't work in Moscow. Right. Right. It
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:02.260]  is mutually assured destruction there. Right. Well, or, you know, and there may be, there's
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:06.340]  other countries that are bigger. There wouldn't be mutually assured destruction, destruction.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.460]  Like London. You can't just take the London airport. Right. Uh, well pick a country without
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:16.140]  nukes, but you know, yeah. Australia, let's say. Yeah. Sydney. I don't know because our
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:20.140]  relations with Sydney, I don't know if you've heard, they're, they're a little Rocky. Okay.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:25.580]  Uh, but, uh, yeah, that's not a bad analogy that, you know, yeah. Grenada is a little
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:31.580]  different than, you know, bigger countries. Um, yeah. Uh, I still, I just feel like they
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.220]  should have figured out in the old days, this is the funny part is, you know, in the old
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:41.860]  days were in the innocent days of iOS, you know, it's just funny cause it, it, it, it's
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:46.020]  hard. I think it's hard for Apple people who work at Apple to even think it from their
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:49.860]  perspective of like these ad networks that want to do all this tracking and stuff. But
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:54.500]  in the old days there were API's official API's, not like private API's, but like it,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:59.460]  the idea that you might want to uniquely identify a phone was like a feature and it was only
[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:05.300]  once that started getting abused by ad networks and privacy invasive ways that Apple deprecated
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:09.980]  and then remove those API's. Yeah. You could just take the UDID right and share it. I think
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:13.620]  as you want it to. Right. Like when you plug your phone into iTunes, iTunes can still see
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:18.260]  it. You see there's a unique device identifier. I think it's printed on the back of the phone
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:23.220]  still in that small print. I can't read it. It's too small. But they used to sometimes
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.220]  on some models that they would print it on, but you can go to the settings screen and
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:34.340]  iOS and get the UDID. Um, and you can get the Mac address. In other words, each ethernet
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:39.820]  port in the world has a unique Mac address that that can uniquely identify a device.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:44.260]  I mean, I remember in the old days when that first started being used and it wasn't all
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:48.540]  that reliable because people, you know, hack, you know, building their own PCs would take
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:54.860]  the ethernet, you know, it was a card that you could take out. And so, you know, you
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:00.260]  couldn't necessarily associate the ethernet ID, the Mac ID with a device, but obviously
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:04.620]  nobody is changing the Mac ID of an iPhone. Um, there were all sorts of ways to uniquely
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:09.500]  identify a device that were officially supported and Apple's one by one eliminated them all.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:16.300]  Um, but it's, you know, it's obvious to anybody when Apple eliminated those things that figuring
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:22.020]  out a way around it to still get a unique identifier on an iPhone was contrary to Apple's
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:28.420]  intentions. Like this is not a loophole. This was a direct circumvention, you know, of a
[01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:32.700]  locked door. You know what I mean? Like somebody leaves a door unlocked and you go in, you
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:35.780]  can maybe argue, I didn't know I wasn't supposed to go in. The door wasn't locked. If you get
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:41.740]  to a door and it's locked, but you figure out a way to unlock it, did you have no excuse?
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.860]  Yeah, no, totally. And again, this is Uber is famous, you know, and sometimes they've
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:51.380]  been applauded for their pugnacious, you know, combative, do what you want to do, ask for,
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.780]  you know, don't ask for permission. And this is the flip side of that.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.660]  Right. Um, the other thing that rolled out of this story was sort of an aside in this
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:09.380]  Mike Isaac story about Uber and this collection of data was that Uber had one of the other
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:13.500]  things, you know, the greatest hits of all the shady stuff that they've done, but that
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:20.180]  they paid money to a company called Unroll Me. Or no, I guess it was the parent company
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:26.180]  of Unroll Me and they slice analytics. And that's a company that's come up before in
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:30.700]  iPhone and Apple related products, where Slice is this company that claims to have, and does
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:36.220]  have, access to people's inboxes because they offer these services where they, they let
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:41.260]  people sign up and get some kind of rewards in exchange for Slice getting to see their
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:49.180]  incoming email. Um, which again, sounds crazy to me that you, you know, but you know, some
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:55.140]  people, you know, have different people. Yeah. People do not see the value of their
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:58.860]  data the way they see the value of their cash or their time, despite the fact that these
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:02.260]  companies will spend unlimited amounts of time and money just to get your data.
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:06.460]  The Slice has come up before where they've used this data to come out and make projections
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.540]  about what iPhones people have bought and how it compares you over a year because their
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:16.700]  customers last year got so many iPhone receipts in their email in the first 72 hours since
[01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:21.360]  it went on sale. And this year it's this and that. And so I, you know, my mention of them
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.820]  previously is I don't really, you know, it's interesting. I don't think it's complete noise,
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.420]  but I don't trust data when it only comes from people who've signed up for a service
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:34.980]  that lets a internet marketing firm read all of your email. But they, they bought a company
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:40.460]  called Unroll Me, um, that offers a service that again, you filter all your email through
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:47.820]  them and they make it easy to, uh, like unsubscribe from things you can unsubscribe to or to put
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:54.540]  all of your, uh, not spam, but like, you know, newsletter type things that would have an
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.760]  unsubscribe me link at the bottom, put them all together in a folder or collapse them
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:04.600]  or something like that. Um, and these bastards, it turns out, were then selling it. They sold,
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.980]  so they sold information to Uber that using their, their access to these people, inboxes
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:14.580]  gave, you know, Uber bought like all of the Lyft receipts from these people supposedly
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:19.900]  anonymized, but like I wrote on Daring Fireball will supposedly, you know, uh, an iPhone that
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:26.500]  you do a factory reset on is anonymized too. And Uber was tracking that and you can't trust
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:31.700]  them. There's all sorts of ways that they could, you know, backwards correlate, you
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:35.860]  know, even some somewhat anyway, I think a lot of people and a lot of people were rightly
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.980]  like, Whoa, I use this Unroll Me. I, there's absolutely no way that I thought that something
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:47.340]  like my Lyft receipt would be sold to a Uber. Uh, yeah. And it's, it, again, it's one of
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:51.460]  those things where we don't appreciate the value of our data and there's a bunch of apps
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:55.120]  that you can just give permission. Like I remember when I signed up for TripIt, I would
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.820]  just forward them an email with my travel information. They said, why are you going
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:01.940]  to this trouble? Just give us access to your Gmail. And I know, and I eventually I stopped
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:05.860]  using Gmail because there's just so many services that want to tie into it. And I know that's
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:09.580]  not exactly an equivalency, but I just don't want to provide access to that stuff because
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:12.960]  there's so much information in there and mine is all just, it's a business email. It's all
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:17.480]  just a bunch of like travel stuff. But that, that data is incredibly valuable, valuable
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:22.460]  to me. And they're not really, they're not really making a fair purchase decision there.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:31.320]  So the CEO and founder of this company, Joe Heday, in the day after this came out, he,
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.980]  he wrote a blog post or he said, our users are the heart of our company and service.
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.100]  So it was heartbreaking to see that some of our users were upset to learn about how we
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:43.340]  monetize our free service. And while we try our best to be open about our business model,
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:49.240]  recent customer feedback tells me we weren't explicit enough. And it really, again, it,
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:54.740]  if you read their terms of service, yes, it was in there in certain words, but people
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:58.020]  don't read the terms of service and everybody knows they don't. And there was certainly
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:03.420]  no bullet point in the main, like, Hey, why you should sign up for this service. Here's
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:08.380]  how we make money. And I think what it is, is that people who haven't just there, cause
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:11.860]  they don't think like this good, good, honest people who just don't think that someone would
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:16.900]  do something like this here about the service, they know that their inbox every day that,
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:21.140]  you know, two thirds of it isn't spam, but also isn't like the most important stuff.
[01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:26.260]  And so something that could help organize that so that the actual like email from colleagues
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:32.300]  or family or friends is all there, organized sounds like a good deal signs up for it. And
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.900]  even if you say, well, you know, you're giving them access to your email. They might think,
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.100]  ah, you know, I don't really care. There's nothing, there's nothing in there that I care
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:41.860]  about. But then later on you tell them, you know, I know exactly what you bought your
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:47.140]  husband for father's day last year. What? Yeah. Yeah. You bought him this and because
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:50.900]  we have your email and it's like, all of a sudden you tell them an example like that
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.920]  or you tell them, yeah, yeah, they, they, you know, you know, those four times you got
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.860]  a lift. Uh, yeah, we sent those to Uber. Well, they knew when you were out of that, we knew
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:02.180]  you were traveling, you were out of the house. Nobody was at your home. I mean, it's, and
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:06.660]  this is not new. I remember, uh, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, for example, if you go
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:10.540]  to seven 11 and buy a Coke, Coke has no idea you bought it, but seven 11 does. And they'll
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:14.780]  sell that information back to Coke, but they'll also sell it to Pepsi for competitive analysis
[01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:17.980]  and to like Lay's potato chips. So they can say, we want to be positioned next to Coke
[01:54:17.980 --> 01:54:22.500]  on the, on the shelf, not next to Pepsi. And you think that it's anonymous, but it's not
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:26.340]  because they could figure out based on one unique identifier, one phone number, one time
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:29.820]  or one email address or something that you were the person buying the diapers and the
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:33.620]  beer, you know, at that supermarket that day. I, anyway, like I wrote about this, give me
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:37.620]  a fucking break that they're heartbroken that their users are upset. They're not upset if
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.020]  they knew their users would be upset, which is why they hid exactly what they're doing
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:45.900]  in the small print of the terms of service. They're upset because there were suddenly
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:51.200]  the focus of a massive spotlight of a story that every reasonable person would say, wow,
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.320]  that is outrageous and is offensive. And I wouldn't use that service, which was obviously
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.460]  going to hurt their brand and make people, I never even heard of this on roll me before.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:04.780]  So the first time I heard of it was in the context of don't sign up for this thing or
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.300]  I know people who use it and they were, they were shocked, right? Or like, like if you
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:12.220]  think in the back of your mind that signing up for a free service that can read an index,
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:17.580]  all of your email is a bad idea. Uh, guess what it is. They were heartbroken. They got
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:22.300]  caught. I think you said that. Well, right, right. And you know, there was somebody on,
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:27.260]  on a hacker news who posted that he worked for a company that was thinking about acquiring
[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:32.620]  them and when they did their due diligence, that unroll me was literally keeping an archive
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:37.960]  of every single email of every single email that all of their customers ever got since
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.780]  they signed up for the service. Yeah. And that they were just sort of served in a scary
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:46.980]  fashion in Amazon AWS buckets. Yeah. And that, I mean, that's part of the problem here is
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:50.140]  those buckets could be hacked. It could be an employee decides to abuse the information
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:53.100]  contained in there when there's extra copies of your stuff hanging around, you no longer
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:57.660]  have control over that information. Yeah. Uh, what else do we have? I got, I got this
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:02.500]  Hulu live had, they've shipped a new live TV thing, a $40 a month like cable cutter
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.620]  package. Do you see this just came out today? I did. I'm jealous. There's all these great
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:09.700]  services in the U S I just simply don't have access to. And you guys have none of that
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:14.780]  in Canada. No, no. We have like a, we're, we allow our telcos to own our broadcasters.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:18.780]  So we have bell and Rogers who own those things and they don't want to give it to us. So I,
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:26.220]  I looked into this recently cause I had to switch at it. We moved, so I had to get new
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:31.860]  cable service and internet service and stuff. Um, and at first, cause we're, we're a TiVo
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.700]  family. We've always been a TiVo family and I couldn't get, and this always happens. This
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:38.420]  has happened to me for 10 years. Every time I've tried to say changing or getting a new
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:43.820]  TV or something like that, the cable card thing doesn't work. There's like a card and,
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.860]  and it's, I guess the idea is that, uh, that they try to make this super secure. It's the
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:54.100]  way that they can get the security of the cable signal on a device they don't own. And
[01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:58.340]  part of it I think is just that they want you to buy their stupid box, their box. I
[01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:04.220]  don't want their box. I want TiVo. Um, but we had a hassle getting our TiVo working.
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:08.220]  And so I, I looked into these services for the first time seriously cause I don't watch
[01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:15.780]  a lot of TV. I or, or cable TV, but, but my wife does. Um, and I, I looked at like the
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:21.220]  PlayStation view service and it looks great. It's, I think it's like 30 bucks a month or
[01:57:21.220 --> 01:57:25.160]  40 bucks a month. I don't know, but it's, it's a reasonable price compared to cable.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.660]  And I looked at the list of channels they had and it's, I couldn't find any channels
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:33.980]  missing that I ever watch. And I asked Amy to look and she, you know, as far as she could
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:39.220]  tell, they had all the channels that she watches. They had some, it varies by city here in the
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:45.580]  U S but like in Philadelphia you get ABC, all the major networks, not just the cable
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:50.000]  networks, you get the broadcast networks. Um, apparently in some cities there's the
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.940]  PlayStation view misses something. But like, I honestly have just cause I don't watch a
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:58:02.020]  lot of TV and I'm happy with the TiVo and for what I do watch and what I, when I watched
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:07.120]  on my TV, I'm using Apple TV usually. Um, I just hadn't been paying attention. I know
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.140]  the phrase cable cutting. I know what it means, but I wasn't aware that when you sign up for
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:16.920]  something like this, just how much it's, it's equivalent to having cable TV in terms of
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.700]  what you get per month, you know, that it's the same channels and content. It's just delivered
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:27.060]  in addition, different fashion. And so Hulu is getting into it now. But it's weird. Like
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:31.260]  Hulu, like one of the networks that they don't get is AMC and there's a couple of good shows
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:38.140]  on AMC and I don't understand, you know, what the, what, how that, you know, obviously I
[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:43.640]  guess the tall negotiations, but somehow Hulu doesn't have AMC. And my question for you
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:50.120]  is where's Apple in this? Because I feel like, like this PlayStation view thing is so much
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:56.120]  exactly like what we've been hearing Apple might do. Um, I, what the heck do you think
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.680]  is going on? Yeah. And it's especially frustrating because one of the reasons that we kept hearing
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.060]  that the Apple TV didn't launch earlier is that they were working on these over the top
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:07.500]  services or originally an Apple video version of what Apple music was, where you'd pay one
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:11.740]  price $30 and you'd have access to all the major channels. And then the negotiations
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:14.820]  broke down and then we heard that again, they had become like a set top box sort of thing
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:19.680]  and those broke down and it sort of reminds me of a music when it went DRM free, they
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.420]  just didn't give it to Apple. It was DRM free on Amazon MP3 first and they wanted to break
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:27.940]  Apple's hold on the music industry and that was one of the levers they tried to pull and
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:33.620]  eventually it broke down and Apple got DRM free MP3 music like everybody else. And I
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:37.860]  wonder if there's still this sort of feeling in the entertainment industry that Apple destroyed
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:41.560]  their music business and they'll be damned if they let Apple destroy their video business
[01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:45.660]  and it ends up being not an advantage to Apple that they did iTunes, they did Apple music,
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:49.260]  but a disadvantage. And now it's, it's, these companies are more reticent to give Apple
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:52.900]  this product and they want to make sure they seed the market with a lot of active competitors
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:56.660]  before they agree to terms with Apple. Yeah, I think that that might be it. I really do
[01:59:56.660 --> 02:00:01.460]  that Apple is having a much harder time negotiating just because of exactly what you said and
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:05.880]  has nothing really to do about dollar amounts, but just sort of a vague notion that the entertainment
[02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:10.200]  industry feels like Apple picked their pocket last time. Even though I don't think there's
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:14.980]  any aspect of it that wasn't above the board, I just think that they, I think basically
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:19.660]  they thought when they first, you know, allowed Apple to create the iTunes store that Apple
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:26.060]  has had this reputation as a niche player and you know, the iPod at the time was a Mac
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:30.580]  only device. And so it limited, you know, even if it was wildly successful among the,
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:34.140]  all the people who could get an iPod got an iPod, it still wasn't that big of a market
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:37.980]  because it would only be one to one with the number of people who have a Mac and that they
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:42.660]  just never foresaw that Apple, you know, and you know, even people who don't pay close
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:48.240]  attention to the computer industry had the basic rough outline of a sketch where Apple
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:55.820]  was this little tiny California company that was like a 99 to one dwarf compared to Microsoft
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.260]  and Windows and PCs.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.860]  No, I think that's it entirely. And there was that famous quote, and I know you referenced
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:05.980]  this recently in the Netflix article where Steve Jobs said your competition is free and
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:10.020]  it's piracy and it's theft and it was Napster. And we just saw that with Netflix where Orange
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:14.780]  is the New Black was essentially stolen and held for ransom. But the privacy, like the
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:18.980]  piracy rates for Netflix are extremely low because the service is so popular but also
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:20.300]  so reasonably priced.
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:27.180]  Right. And so reasonably policed in terms of like sharing, you know, that your kid goes
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:32.260]  to college and still has the family Netflix password, so what? They don't care. They don't
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:37.180]  care if, you know, your kid's going to University of Michigan and your family lives in Philadelphia
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:43.800]  and obviously, you know, they do the geolocation on IP and they know that. They don't care.
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:48.220]  It's like it's, you know, I'm sure that there's some kickoff where at a certain X number of
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:52.340]  people using the same Netflix account, it automatically triggers something. But if that
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.420]  number is reasonable, they don't care. They feel like...
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:57.900]  And it's so reasonable. Like I actually had a family member who was using my account when
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:01.420]  they were staying with me and they went and got their own place and they, you know, they
[02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.960]  used my account for a little while, I think a month, but then they got their own because
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.500]  it was so reasonably priced. They just didn't want to be bound to my, like they didn't want
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:11.180]  to see the same things that I was watching all the time. Sorry.
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:17.140]  Well, I just feel like you cannot overstate how important that is to Netflix's runaway
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:23.860]  success, their generosity in terms of, or not generosity, but relaxedness of this.
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:25.260]  It's almost like a pragmatism.
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:29.420]  Right. Compare and contrast with the Comcast attitude with these cable cards in Nativo
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:35.980]  where literally an actual service person came to the house twice and failed to get one to
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.500]  actually work and register.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.500]  They treat you like a criminal, not like a customer.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:42.920]  Well, they were very nice to me. They were very nice to me. It's just that they've set
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:47.620]  up the technology. The service people were super nice, but that the technology is designed
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:53.780]  from a perspective to be super, super persnickety in terms of this. And the only logic behind
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:57.260]  it is that they're fearful that I'm going to like pop the cable card out of my TiVo
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:02.720]  and go to your house and put it in your TiVo and watch Game of Thrones one Sunday night
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:03.720]  for free at your house.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:08.220]  Or hook it up to a computer and get their high quality stream of Star Wars on the internet.
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:13.900]  Whatever. It's crazy. But the Netflix style is proven and their runaway success in every
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:14.900]  regard shows that.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:18.660]  Well, it's like iTunes. Instead of assuming that you're someone who wants to rip them
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:21.820]  off, they assume that you're a customer who wants to be good and they give you a product
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:22.820]  that engenders that.
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:27.060]  Right. And so it's very interesting to me to see that the BitTorrent rates for all this
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:35.220]  stuff has actually gone down and that a lot of what is left seems to be attributable to
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:40.580]  content that's not available in certain places. So like Game of Thrones in particular is probably
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:46.900]  – I don't even think there's a question that it's the most pirated content on BitTorrent.
[02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:47.900]  But –
[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:50.180]  Apparently Travelers because a lot of stuff was stream only for a long time and you just
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:51.340]  wanted to have it with them on a plane or something.
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:55.440]  A huge part of that though is the parts around the world where Game of Thrones isn't even
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.100]  legally available. So it's pretty interesting. And I do think that there is a huge convenience
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:06.780]  factor on that. Part of it for me is that – I do. I know there are some people who
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:11.900]  pirate all sorts of stuff and don't think twice about it. But when I was younger, I
[02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:17.620]  had pirated copies of Photoshop when I was in college because what was I going to do?
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:24.020]  Spend $600 for Photoshop? No. But I stopped pirating stuff as soon as I could afford to
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:31.580]  buy stuff because I knew it was wrong. I don't know. Honestly, I'm not trying to make anybody
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:36.740]  feel bad but I do – and I create – partly I'm biased. I create content. I happen to
[02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:44.420]  give my stuff away. But in theory, I can imagine selling it and it would not make me happy
[02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:49.020]  if people were bootlegging it.
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.420]  Well, you still want them to go to Daring Firewall to get it. You don't want someone
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:53.980]  else just reproducing your entire website on Twitter for other websites.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:05:00.620]  Exactly. Perfect example. Right. As a content creator, I might be more sympathetic but it
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:04.940]  just seems like it's the right thing to do. But also, even just putting the morals
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:09.980]  of it behind as a lazy person, the BitTorrent thing just seems like so much work. Oh my
[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:10.980]  god. It's just like –
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.140]  You can get malware and all sorts of things.
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:20.660]  Yeah. Just these crazy file formats and part one, part two, part three and you got to stitch
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:25.700]  them together and all – what the hell? I just want to – honest to god, I really – and
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:29.900]  I just want to talk to the microphone and say, put the godfather part two on.
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:30.900]  Yes.
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:34.540]  I really do. And it just spins for a little bit and then I hit a button and it starts
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:35.540]  playing.
[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:37.540]  Yeah. No, totally.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:40.980]  So I can't do it. All right. Anything else you wanted to talk about?
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:46.780]  No. I mean, I think we hit on all the major points now that was that minor flare up again
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:50.740]  in Apple's role in App Store and indie apps but that's –
[02:05:50.740 --> 02:05:51.740]  What was that?
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:56.940]  – quite a new argument. Well, Apple put out their job creation and they often tout
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:01.340]  how many iOS developers they've empowered to this. So Matt Gemmell put up a post saying
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:06.220]  that Apple – and he also mentioned consumers and developers and everything. Once again,
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:09.140]  but the App Store was responsible for devaluing software.
[02:06:09.140 --> 02:06:16.540]  Yeah. I saw that and I was nodding my head the whole time but I didn't see anything
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:21.260]  as new and I don't know. I mean, there is something to be said there and I sort of agree
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:26.180]  with it. I don't know though that anything has actually changed in that regard.
[02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:29.260]  No, I wrote about it earlier today because I sort of – I talked to a lot of our developer
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:32.300]  friends and a lot of people who are involved in the industry and there's sort of this
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:37.760]  consensus that – and I think this is true that it sort of hit traditional software developers
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:41.060]  hard because they thought that they were the new thing but they turned out to be traditional
[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:45.020]  in every sense of the word and that's just as open to disruption as any industry and
[02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:49.420]  we no longer live in an age where only a few people have computers and you spend $500 for
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:53.260]  WordStar and there's a box of software on the shelf and all of those things are true.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:58.100]  We now have – almost everyone has access to ubiquitously connected computing devices
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:02.820]  thanks to the smartphone and what we perceive of as apps is incredibly different. There's
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:07.460]  millions of apps and no one's going to spend $30 to $40 for a thousand apps a year. It's
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:11.500]  not possible. And the same token, no one's going to spend $500 on WordStar now that Google
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.820]  Docs is in every browser. So the entire industry is turned upside down and I think the App
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:20.300]  Store may have hastened that but I think it's more a reflection of where the industry went
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:23.980]  and not a single-handed dastardly villain sort of a thing.
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:32.260]  Right, but people – tens and hundreds, maybe thousands of people are spending $10, $15
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:41.380]  a week on Clash of Clans and Candy Crush in-game upgrades and then somebody like Tapbots puts
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:47.340]  exquisite – a year-long exquisite work into a Twitter client and wants to charge $4 for
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:52.020]  the upgrade from the old one and the same people are outraged. So I get it. I get it.
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:55.660]  It's traditional. We will pay for ego and instant gratification. That's why Tulips
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:59.580]  were worth a fortune. It made no sense but we wanted to have more Tulips than our friends
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:00.580]  had.
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:04.220]  Right. It's like a Twitter client could make – a four-pay Twitter client could make
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:09.820]  more money by locking you out of features than by just charging upfront.
[02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:15.300]  Yeah, no. It's absolutely true. It's just I think it's a far bigger movement than
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.940]  an App Store can account for. It's just the – Guy English said this really well
[02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:22.500]  a couple of years ago. We've gotten to a pop culture for apps. It took longer to get
[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:25.700]  there than it did for other mediums but it still got there.
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:30.380]  Yeah. I don't know. It's just a small thing. It's just a small thing but I – and
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:34.480]  it's funny because it actually popped into my head yesterday after you agreed to be on
[02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:41.540]  the show. But I keep an Apple note, an iCloud note with the list of all the episodes of
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:48.000]  the talk show and who's been on them and the episode number just so I have it to reference.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.980]  And I type like this episode that we're doing right now is episode 189. And then I
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.180]  type tab and then I type Rene Ritchie. And then I might put in parenthesis just like
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:01.580]  the basic topics of what we did. And then it's there and I can look back to it in
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:06.780]  advance. But I was doing it on my phone and I can't type a tab. I have to type a space.
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:11.620]  And then I go on – later on, I'll open it up on my Mac and replace the space with
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:20.340]  a tab. And I want to do that because I'm a picky, picky person. But San Francisco,
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:26.740]  the font that Apple Notes uses now, doesn't have proportionate numbers. So in other words,
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:30.660]  in a lot of fonts, especially older digital fonts, they would make – even if the font
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:38.220]  itself was not a monospace font like Courier, the numbers are so that if you type 111 and
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:44.460]  then 444 underneath it, the numbers line up. The number one is just as wide as the number
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:51.300]  four. San Francisco isn't like that. It's a non-proportionate font. So the ones in particular
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:54.940]  are narrower than the other numbers. And so if I use the space, if I type the episode
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:59.220]  number and the space and then your name, then the names don't line up and that bothers
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:05.660]  me. So I type a tab. But I can't type the tab on my iPhone. And that seems like a bizarre
[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:13.820]  oversight in 2017. And it just hits me with the ongoing debate over can you – is there
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:16.820]  a need for a Mac? Can you do all your work on iOS? Well, hell, you can't even type
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:18.180]  a tab on the iPhone.
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:21.260]  Steve McLaughlin No, it's very true. I mean, there's just
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:25.220]  – there doesn't seem to me like there's any reason why the basic actually characters
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:27.980]  not be available on an iPhone. I mean, especially not in 2017.
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:32.060]  I think – here's my suggestion to anybody at Apple who's listening. I would suggest
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:38.700]  it be a little pop-up on the space bar, on a tap and hold on the space bar. Make tab,
[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:44.060]  you know, if you're looking for a place to put it. But the Mac – here's the thing.
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:51.660]  The Mac had a way to type all of these extended characters like in, I think, right in 1984.
[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:55.940]  And if it wasn't, it was certainly there by like 85 or 86. And they're great. They're
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:59.100]  so brilliant. And it's one of the ways – one of the little ways that the Mac has always
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:06.020]  been so much better than DOS and Windows where if you wanted to type an M dash, it – not
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:11.220]  only was it pretty easy to do it, but there's actually a really clever mnemonic to the shortcut.
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:17.900]  It's option shift hyphen. Well, hyphen is like a dash, and a shift makes it bigger.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:24.900]  So option dash would give you like the little mini dash like the N dash, and option shift
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:30.980]  dash would give you the bigger one because shift is bigger, and you get the dash. Option
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:35.780]  eight gives you a bullet character because eight is the character with the asterisk,
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:39.460]  which is sort of the ASCII bullet character.
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:42.660]  Option zero is the degree symbol for temperatures.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:47.980]  No, is it? I thought it's option shift eight is the degree character.
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:51.140]  No, sorry. The bullet, I think, is option shift eight, and then the higher one, the
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:56.220]  degree character is, I think, shift zero. But it's all well-considered. It's where
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:58.020]  you would assume that the character would be.
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:03.980]  Right. How do you type the upside-down exclamation mark? You type option one because that's
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:08.820]  where the exclamation mark is. So brilliant. Whereas in Windows, it was like Alt-2-1-3-6.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:16.020]  It gives you a pound sign or whatever, like the British pound. Crazy. There's no logic
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:21.980]  to it at all. It's just some arbitrary numeric mapping. The Mac had it. It's brilliant.
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:26.980]  It's been there forever. How do you type the pi character, like 3.14159?
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:28.060]  That I don't know.
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:29.060]  Option P.
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:30.700]  Oh, yeah. Nice.
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:33.700]  Option shift P gives you a capital pi.
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:36.180]  And option slash gives you the percentage.
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:44.660]  Yeah. There's just so cleverly assigned, and they've been like that for over 30 years.
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:50.780]  And yet on iOS, you can't type half of those characters at all. And I don't understand
[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.780]  why that's not possible.
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:54.460]  Your keyboard, team friends. And while they're doing that, I'm going to say this completely
[02:12:54.460 --> 02:13:01.900]  unabashedly. Let me long press on the french fries to get poutine tater tots and hash browns.
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.780]  I support that wholeheartedly.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:05.580]  Someone has to do it.
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:11.820]  I mean, I'm going down memory lane here. But I don't even have to think. I typed these
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.140]  without even thinking.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.140]  Yeah.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:17.780]  I'm going to double check to be sure. But you can type option semicolon, and you get
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:24.140]  an ellipse. I guess that one's not super mnemonic. But anyway. Anyway, that's my complaint.
[02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:30.620]  I want someone at Apple to let me type a tab character on my phone.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:31.620]  Anything else?
[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:33.740]  Nothing comes to mind.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:36.340]  Rene, I thank you for your time. Hope you have a good weekend.
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:37.340]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:40.420]  I will see you soon. I'm looking forward to it. I'll see you a month from now. We'll
[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:42.500]  be palling around at the keynote.
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:45.620]  Yeah, I can't wait. It should be a good year.
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:49.580]  Yeah. It's very nice to sign off and say, I'll see you soon. But I'll see you soon.
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.940]  My thanks to our sponsors. Our sponsors this week were—let me see if I can do it off
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:57.500]  the top of my head. We had Squarespace as a place to go to build a website. We had Casper,
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:03.680]  where you go to get a mattress. Who was our third sponsor? I forget the third sponsor.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.460]  Third sponsor was—oh, of course, it was Audible. That's the place with an unmatched
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:09.460]  selection of audio.
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:12.460]  All right, Rene. Thank you.
