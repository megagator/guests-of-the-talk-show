[00:00.000 --> 00:01.160]  Let's do something unusual.
[00:01.160 --> 00:03.360]  Let's actually talk about stuff that's in the news.
[00:03.360 --> 00:04.640]  OK.
[00:04.640 --> 00:05.440]  It's your show.
[00:05.440 --> 00:07.520]  Is it?
[00:07.520 --> 00:08.120]  Is it?
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.520]  That's what I've been given to understand.
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.640]  Until somebody comes in and takes it away from me.
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.560]  Is there a hostile takeover happening
[00:14.560 --> 00:15.560]  that I don't know about?
[00:15.560 --> 00:16.760]  Well, I don't know.
[00:16.760 --> 00:19.120]  I grew up thinking that if you have a talk show,
[00:19.120 --> 00:22.000]  then eventually somebody comes and takes it away from you.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.200]  I guess that's true, yeah.
[00:23.200 --> 00:24.880]  But you had Guy on last week, right?
[00:24.880 --> 00:25.840]  He didn't take it away.
[00:25.840 --> 00:28.480]  So if Guy didn't take it away, then you're probably right.
[00:28.480 --> 00:30.880]  Yeah, if anybody's going to take it away, it's probably Guy.
[00:30.880 --> 00:34.280]  Do you see Letterman is going to be on the late night
[00:34.280 --> 00:36.200]  with Seth Meyers on Tuesday.
[00:36.200 --> 00:37.320]  I did, yeah.
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.420]  That'll probably be worth watching.
[00:39.420 --> 00:43.000]  I'm extremely excited because, of course, a big Letterman fan.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.040]  I also, my personal favorite of the current late night talk shows
[00:48.040 --> 00:49.520]  is Seth Meyers' show.
[00:49.520 --> 00:50.440]  I really enjoy it.
[00:50.440 --> 00:53.360]  I feel like their closer looks should
[00:53.360 --> 00:55.200]  be winning some sort of awards.
[00:55.200 --> 00:55.920]  I don't know.
[00:55.920 --> 00:58.800]  They're very good, like little mini political current event
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.320]  essays that are also funny.
[01:00.320 --> 01:03.440]  But also, Letterman, I mean, he's my favorite host.
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.480]  But he's also, he's like the prototypical good guest on a show.
[01:07.480 --> 01:07.960]  So.
[01:07.960 --> 01:09.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.760]  Ready to nerd out on Tuesday night.
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.720]  You've seen him in the, I think those are the outtakes for the movie
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.160]  of Between Two Ferns.
[01:16.160 --> 01:17.680]  Yes, I think so, yeah.
[01:17.680 --> 01:18.640]  They're very funny.
[01:21.520 --> 01:23.760]  I forget what he called it, Crystal Meth Santa Claus?
[01:23.760 --> 01:26.800]  Is that what he called it?
[01:26.800 --> 01:28.200]  Oh, man.
[01:28.200 --> 01:30.360]  He was absolutely amazing.
[01:30.360 --> 01:32.000]  The outtake, I like the movie.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.480]  I love the Between Two Thirds.
[01:33.480 --> 01:39.680]  That's Zach Galifianakis' not really fake talk show or interview show.
[01:39.680 --> 01:40.960]  It is real interviews.
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.600]  Hillary Clinton famously did it before the 2016 election.
[01:44.600 --> 01:45.600]  A lot of good at dinner.
[01:45.600 --> 01:47.840]  But maybe, who knows, maybe it helped.
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.440]  But real people with Zach Galifianakis asking absolutely,
[01:53.440 --> 01:55.200]  absurd questions.
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.400]  And very rude.
[01:56.400 --> 01:56.960]  Right.
[01:56.960 --> 01:57.840]  Very rude.
[01:57.840 --> 02:02.000]  And then they made a motion picture of it, which was, it was okay.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.200]  I thought it was okay too, yeah.
[02:03.200 --> 02:03.600]  Yeah.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.880]  I enjoyed it well enough.
[02:04.880 --> 02:06.480]  The outtakes were actually.
[02:06.480 --> 02:08.320]  But the outtakes are absolutely the best.
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.640]  It's worth renting, even if you like get into the movie.
[02:12.640 --> 02:14.000]  I don't love the movie.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.200]  I might just stop.
[02:15.200 --> 02:17.200]  Skip ahead to the credits because they're amazing.
[02:17.200 --> 02:17.520]  Yeah.
[02:17.520 --> 02:19.280]  It's just seeing him break.
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.800]  That's always my favorite part of Saturday Night Live where they break
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.720]  form and start, you know, they can't control themselves.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.680]  They're laughing so hard.
[02:25.680 --> 02:30.800]  And just seeing him start cracking up and then apologize.
[02:30.800 --> 02:32.320]  Just like, I'm so sorry.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.840]  Ask Brie Larson if her parents' breakup was her fault.
[02:39.840 --> 02:40.340]  Yeah.
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.520]  Anyway, in the news, we've got Apple results.
[02:47.520 --> 02:54.720]  We've got new betas of macOS 12.3 and iOS 15.4 coming out and anything else.
[02:54.720 --> 02:55.200]  I don't know.
[02:55.200 --> 02:58.000]  I guess we should start with the results because they had one thing.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  I think that you've been on the show at some point shortly after results before.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.920]  And I always say, if one thing savvy investors always do is tune into this podcast for their.
[03:07.920 --> 03:09.680]  For their results information.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.180]  Yeah.
[03:10.480 --> 03:12.720]  Five minute results information.
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.200]  But it is, it's like my quick takeaway that I wrote on Darren Fireball is if you can
[03:17.200 --> 03:23.760]  have as the most profitable company and biggest by market cap in the world, a boring record
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.560]  breaking quarter, Apple has been doing it pretty consistently.
[03:28.560 --> 03:28.720]  Yeah.
[03:28.720 --> 03:29.760]  And I was thinking about that.
[03:29.760 --> 03:36.080]  We used to hang on these results a lot and now they just seem like a non-event to a certain
[03:36.080 --> 03:36.720]  degree.
[03:36.720 --> 03:42.320]  Obviously, sometimes it's a big deal and various things can happen, but I don't feel
[03:42.320 --> 03:46.240]  like it's as dire as it used to be.
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.640]  And maybe that's, that was still a hangover from the days when we thought that Apple might
[03:50.640 --> 03:51.840]  go out of business at some point.
[03:52.560 --> 03:55.280]  I do think what comes up must come down.
[03:55.280 --> 03:58.880]  Eventually Apple is going to not be the biggest company in the world.
[03:58.880 --> 03:59.440]  They will.
[04:00.480 --> 04:02.880]  Is it a five-year thing, a 10-year thing?
[04:02.880 --> 04:08.000]  Is it after you and I are dead 25, 30 years from now, but it will happen, right?
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.400]  I mean, you know, the East India trading company is not that big a deal anymore.
[04:12.400 --> 04:13.600]  How were their results this week?
[04:13.600 --> 04:18.560]  I don't know if they've announced them yet, but it's going to change eventually.
[04:18.560 --> 04:25.520]  But in the near term, it is hard to see how Apple's, they really seem to have a very
[04:26.800 --> 04:29.360]  consistent and solid business.
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.640]  Like their primary things that are driving revenue and profit, the devices, iPhone and
[04:34.640 --> 04:40.560]  iPad and Mac and AirPods and watches and the services is growing.
[04:40.560 --> 04:45.760]  And it's, there just is not that much cyclical fluctuation like there were in times past.
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.680]  And I can't help but think too, that how long are we?
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.760]  We're like, what, just past?
[04:51.760 --> 04:56.240]  Yeah, it was, we were just celebrating Tim Cook's 10 years as CEO, I believe.
[04:56.240 --> 04:58.960]  Yeah, so the end of 2021.
[04:58.960 --> 05:02.560]  So, you know, it's a whole decade, which is a long run.
[05:02.560 --> 05:09.200]  But it's like towards the latter few years of this decade of Tim Cook as CEO, the company
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.360]  has taken more and more of his personality, in my opinion.
[05:14.240 --> 05:21.200]  And in the way that it's like, obviously, what we think of with Steve Jobs and Apple
[05:21.200 --> 05:24.640]  were his product decisions and his taste in the products.
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.760]  And Tim Cook doesn't do that.
[05:25.760 --> 05:29.600]  He doesn't try to, he never pretends like, hey, I'm the genius who's going to come up
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.880]  with the next big thing.
[05:30.880 --> 05:31.200]  Right.
[05:31.200 --> 05:34.080]  But it's like his personality, what is his personality?
[05:34.080 --> 05:40.960]  It's like competent, smart, consistent, and that's the company now, like the company.
[05:40.960 --> 05:47.120]  And I just think about little things, like, remember when Jobs was CEO, I forget what
[05:47.120 --> 05:53.760]  year it was, but there was like a somewhat serious stock option scandal, controversy,
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.040]  where they'd...
[05:56.800 --> 05:58.560]  They backdated a bunch of stock ins for him.
[05:58.560 --> 05:58.960]  Right.
[05:58.960 --> 06:03.840]  They, and for other executives, I think, but I think it was for him too, but it was
[06:03.840 --> 06:08.480]  fishy, you know, and you just say backdated stock options and you already think that doesn't
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.480]  even, that already sounds like it's fishy.
[06:10.480 --> 06:14.960]  It just sort of a fast and loose approach to dealing with it.
[06:14.960 --> 06:18.960]  And it seemed like the long story short of, hey, can we do this?
[06:18.960 --> 06:21.120]  And like, somebody was like, I don't know if we should do this.
[06:21.120 --> 06:22.800]  And they're like, well, Steve says to do it.
[06:22.800 --> 06:23.520]  And they're like, okay.
[06:25.040 --> 06:26.640]  And that's how they got into trouble.
[06:26.640 --> 06:28.800]  Nobody went to jail and they worked it out.
[06:28.800 --> 06:30.720]  And I don't know if they paid a fine or whatever.
[06:30.720 --> 06:35.360]  I can't remember the guy's name, the guy who was the CFO at the time, but he retired
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.280]  not long after that.
[06:37.280 --> 06:40.320]  And I think he ended up, he might've gotten fined or something like that.
[06:41.520 --> 06:45.040]  I probably shouldn't say that because maybe that's not true, but I feel like he was at
[06:45.040 --> 06:45.840]  least interviewed.
[06:46.400 --> 06:48.720]  Like there were some definite concerns about what happened.
[06:48.720 --> 06:53.360]  I'll find a link to the back dating option scandal and we don't have to talk about it.
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.320]  Is it Anderson?
[06:54.320 --> 06:54.720]  Is that the guy?
[06:54.720 --> 06:55.040]  Yeah.
[06:55.040 --> 06:56.000]  It wasn't his name.
[06:56.000 --> 06:56.640]  Yeah.
[06:56.640 --> 06:56.800]  Yeah.
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.200]  That's it.
[06:57.200 --> 06:57.920]  Fred Anderson.
[06:57.920 --> 06:58.400]  Fred.
[06:58.400 --> 06:58.640]  Yeah.
[06:58.640 --> 07:02.880]  He looked like a Fred.
[07:02.880 --> 07:09.600]  I would say in the same way, many people have made this joke, but if you live in Great Britain
[07:09.600 --> 07:17.840]  and you name your son Jeeves, the kid is probably going to grow up to be a manservant or a butler,
[07:17.840 --> 07:18.960]  whatever you call it.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.640]  You know, I mean, what else has he got?
[07:20.640 --> 07:23.760]  I say, I like a CFO named Fred.
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.600]  Just saying it's a good name for a CFO.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.720]  It's got the F.
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.000]  It was Fred Anderson.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.120]  I got it right.
[07:31.120 --> 07:31.520]  Yeah.
[07:31.520 --> 07:33.120]  It wasn't shocking, though.
[07:33.120 --> 07:34.000]  They're going to work it out.
[07:34.000 --> 07:34.880]  It's not that big a deal.
[07:34.880 --> 07:36.880]  It doesn't seem like anybody actually stole anything.
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.320]  It just seems like they didn't dot every I, cross every T, and you're not supposed to
[07:40.320 --> 07:45.280]  do what they did, and you can pay a fine or throw one employee under the bus and you keep
[07:45.280 --> 07:45.840]  going.
[07:45.840 --> 07:48.400]  So yeah, the SEC filed a complaint against him.
[07:48.400 --> 07:50.000]  But it wasn't shocking, right?
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.080]  No, and it wasn't that unusual at the time either, really.
[07:54.080 --> 07:56.240]  There were lots of companies that were doing the same.
[07:56.240 --> 07:57.600]  It's not right.
[07:57.600 --> 07:59.280]  You're not supposed to do it.
[07:59.280 --> 08:02.880]  But there were a number of companies that were doing it during that period.
[08:03.520 --> 08:07.200]  But if it happened under Tim Cook, wouldn't it be it would be shocking?
[08:07.200 --> 08:07.760]  Yes.
[08:07.760 --> 08:09.440]  Yeah, it would be much more shocking.
[08:09.440 --> 08:13.920]  And it's just that he is more of a, I don't know, how would you describe it?
[08:13.920 --> 08:19.280]  Not by the book, but that sort of makes it seem like he's conservative in, you know,
[08:19.280 --> 08:20.720]  lowercase C conservative.
[08:21.280 --> 08:22.880]  And I don't think he is.
[08:22.880 --> 08:26.560]  It's just not in his personality to play fast and loose.
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.360]  Whatever the opposite of fast and loose is, that's Tim Cook.
[08:31.360 --> 08:32.720]  And he's more careful.
[08:32.720 --> 08:35.760]  If he's going to break the rules, he's going to make sure that he covers.
[08:37.200 --> 08:40.960]  And I just think that it just shows in the company's results.
[08:40.960 --> 08:46.000]  They famously had very consistent profit margins, but under Steve Jobs, they had bad
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.120]  quarters and good quarters.
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.640]  And the company was different too.
[08:48.640 --> 08:56.000]  If Jobs hadn't had cancer and had lived longer, it's quite possible that under Steve
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.320]  Jobs still as CEO or as the chairman of the board with Tim Cook as CEO, but still
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.200]  with Steve Jobs around, the company would have gotten more consistent in this way
[09:05.200 --> 09:07.040]  anyway, as they grew bigger.
[09:07.040 --> 09:10.000]  They're so much bigger than they were when Steve Jobs died.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.960]  It's just absolutely mind boggling how much more money they make and how many
[09:14.960 --> 09:17.600]  more of everything they sell.
[09:17.600 --> 09:25.120]  I look at these results, and it's like huge mind boggling sums of money, and it's
[09:25.120 --> 09:27.600]  just very consistent and somehow predictable.
[09:27.600 --> 09:36.400]  Yeah, I think Microsoft used to get dinged for shuffling around revenue between
[09:36.400 --> 09:40.560]  quarters, like trying to move revenue back and forth in order to smooth out their
[09:40.560 --> 09:41.200]  revenue.
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.800]  And I wouldn't be surprised that Apple does something similar, but much more careful
[09:46.800 --> 09:51.120]  than probably less hamfisted than maybe the Microsoft was doing it.
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.880]  One of the things that they talked about in the conference call was the fact that
[09:54.880 --> 09:59.440]  iPad sales were down, but they blamed constraints.
[09:59.440 --> 10:01.120]  They blamed part constraints, right?
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.640]  Yeah, component constraints.
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.200]  Yeah, but also at the same time, there was that story a few months back about the
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.160]  fact that they were repurposing iPad chips for iPhones.
[10:10.960 --> 10:15.200]  So in a way, I mean, that's a constraint, but you decided that the constraint was
[10:15.200 --> 10:17.120]  going to be on iPads rather than on iPhones.
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.400]  I do think, too, iPad is of the three computing platforms.
[10:22.400 --> 10:27.200]  And I know that Apple Watch is actually a little Unix computer, and there's actually
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.080]  little Unix computers in your AirPods.
[10:30.080 --> 10:31.840]  I mean, everything's a computer now.
[10:31.840 --> 10:35.920]  But the three that we think of as personal computing devices, the phone, iPad, and Mac,
[10:35.920 --> 10:46.400]  iPad has always been weird in its like chart of unit sales and revenue.
[10:46.400 --> 10:52.560]  It's like it had these crazy first handful of go-go years where as a nine-month-old
[10:52.560 --> 10:58.800]  product or as a 18-month-old product, it was ahead of the iPhone from when the iPhone
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.720]  was nine months old or 18 months old.
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.840]  From introduction to now, for years, first a couple of years, the iPad was ahead of
[11:05.840 --> 11:06.640]  the iPhone.
[11:06.640 --> 11:12.480]  And I'll admit to buying into maybe it's just so many more people have been exposed
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.920]  to Apple who never really thought about buying Apple stuff.
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.720]  Maybe this line will keep going, and it's just always going to stay ahead of the iPhone
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.640]  and the iPad's going to be the bigger deal.
[11:23.280 --> 11:24.880]  Turns out that wasn't the case.
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.640]  And eventually, it went from like 20 million per quarter down to like 10 million, 9 million.
[11:30.640 --> 11:33.040]  They don't release unit sales anymore.
[11:33.040 --> 11:34.320]  They just release revenue.
[11:34.320 --> 11:36.160]  But it was weird.
[11:36.160 --> 11:37.520]  It like cut in half.
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.600]  And I really do think it was a simple explanation, which is that iPads last forever.
[11:44.240 --> 11:47.120]  You don't abuse them like you do your phone physically.
[11:47.120 --> 11:48.240]  You don't tend to drop them.
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.360]  They're not in your pocket all the time.
[11:49.360 --> 11:50.960]  They don't go everywhere with you.
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.440]  And what people tend to do on an iPad, it doesn't matter if it's four years old or
[11:57.440 --> 11:57.920]  five years old.
[11:57.920 --> 11:58.240]  Right.
[11:58.240 --> 12:02.320]  Like people just find four or five-year-old iPads to be just as good as the day they
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.240]  bought them, and maybe they'd be pleasantly surprised if somebody replaced their regular
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.160]  coffee with Folgers crystals.
[12:08.160 --> 12:09.360]  Somebody came in and said,
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.520]  ha, the iPad you've been using is actually the new iPad Air.
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.240]  And they'd be like, huh, I thought my home button disappeared.
[12:18.720 --> 12:23.120]  Yeah, I think I roll mine over about as often as I roll my Macs over, I would say.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.360]  Yeah, and I keep my Macs for years and years, too.
[12:25.360 --> 12:28.480]  I've got like the first 11-inch iPad Pro.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.240]  Actually, I have it right here with my show notes.
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.960]  So it's like from 2018?
[12:32.960 --> 12:34.560]  Yeah, that's the one I have.
[12:34.560 --> 12:38.320]  I've even reviewed newer ones, because they send them to me and I write reviews.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.520]  And it's, yeah, these are nice.
[12:39.520 --> 12:45.680]  And I still can't think of a damn thing that would be any better or faster than this.
[12:45.680 --> 12:52.160]  Well, I'm sure you did this as well, but Jason Snell every year asks for people to
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.360]  do a report card.
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.600]  I'll spoil mine a little bit, but for Apple.
[12:55.600 --> 13:01.040]  And the thing that I said about the iPad was the new iPad mini is the coolest device that
[13:01.040 --> 13:04.320]  I just simply have absolutely no reason to buy.
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.680]  I really want one, but I am not going to use it.
[13:07.680 --> 13:13.600]  I have my 11-inch Air, or not Air, 11-inch Pro, and I'm not going to, there's no reason
[13:13.600 --> 13:14.320]  for me to buy that.
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.480]  And yet every once in a while, I'll go onto the website and just look at it and think,
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.520]  ah, man, that'd be cool to have.
[13:20.080 --> 13:22.160]  It was worse for me because they sent me one.
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.680]  I had to review you and I really did enjoy it, but it really did feel to me.
[13:27.680 --> 13:33.040]  I feel like my, I was actually, I actually put this in the show notes that somebody,
[13:33.680 --> 13:39.440]  R. Stevens reminded me that the iPad was introduced 12 years ago, I think yesterday.
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.440]  What was his, he had a little quip about it.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.480]  Yeah, I think he said he'd only owned three.
[13:44.480 --> 13:46.000]  I've only, I've owned three.
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.000]  I'm still not entirely sure what they're for.
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.120]  And that's still how I feel.
[13:51.120 --> 14:00.800]  Like I still feel like I depend on, need, and love both my iPhone and my MacBook Pro.
[14:01.520 --> 14:08.800]  And if I really could only have one, recreationally, I'd rather have the iPhone, but for work,
[14:08.800 --> 14:10.240]  I'd rather have the MacBook Pro.
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.480]  If I could, if I were sentenced to prison and they said, but you can take one device
[14:14.480 --> 14:16.960]  with you, I would take the MacBook Pro.
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.960]  But both of them feel essential to me and the iPad feels to me like this is very nice
[14:22.960 --> 14:25.200]  to have and I enjoy using it for long.
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.760]  I really enjoy using it to read like a long article or even like an ebook or something
[14:29.760 --> 14:32.080]  like that, but I don't need it.
[14:32.080 --> 14:32.960]  That's interesting.
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.160]  If you included the iPad in that question, like if you could only have one, I might pick
[14:38.160 --> 14:45.440]  the iPad because the iPad with the magic keyboard is pretty good and does most everything and
[14:45.440 --> 14:48.800]  it's more portable and lets me, there's some, there's still some, I guess there's probably,
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.200]  I'm sure you could do it through the website maybe, but like HBO Max and some other ones.
[14:53.200 --> 14:57.680]  And even Amazon just came out with a viewer thing for, not just, but maybe a month or
[14:57.680 --> 14:59.280]  two ago, for the Mac.
[14:59.280 --> 15:04.880]  But it was a little skippy for me when I watched something using their viewer on the Mac and
[15:04.880 --> 15:06.800]  it's much more smooth on the iPad.
[15:06.800 --> 15:09.040]  So I just prefer watching stuff on the iPad.
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.080]  Yeah, that's true.
[15:10.080 --> 15:10.560]  That's true.
[15:10.560 --> 15:11.840]  If you could stream.
[15:11.840 --> 15:12.240]  Yeah.
[15:12.240 --> 15:14.480]  It depends if I wanted to work or be entertained.
[15:14.480 --> 15:17.120]  And it is, if I'm going to jail, I think I want to be entertained.
[15:17.120 --> 15:18.240]  Yeah, what the hell with this?
[15:18.240 --> 15:20.800]  Somebody else, the hell with my family.
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.640]  I'm not writing this website while I'm in prison.
[15:23.920 --> 15:24.800]  Take care of yourselves.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.280]  I'll be back in five to 10.
[15:27.280 --> 15:34.240]  But it would be preposterous for me to both keep my 11 inch 2018 iPad Pro and get an iPad
[15:34.240 --> 15:39.120]  mini, like, just like a dessert on my dessert device.
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.160]  It doesn't, it just doesn't have a role for me and I don't need to replace my iPad.
[15:44.160 --> 15:48.400]  And if I did replace my iPad, I really would rather have one that's big enough to have
[15:48.400 --> 15:49.520]  a magic keyboard.
[15:49.520 --> 15:52.080]  And so it's not, but it is an adorable device.
[15:52.080 --> 15:58.080]  And I've always loved the form factor of the iPad mini for many, most of the early years
[15:58.080 --> 15:58.960]  of iPad.
[15:58.960 --> 16:01.840]  My personal iPad wasn't mini and I really enjoyed it.
[16:01.840 --> 16:06.080]  Here, let me take a break and we'll get back to the results, but I'll take a break here
[16:06.080 --> 16:08.480]  and thank our first sponsor, our good friends at Linode.
[16:08.480 --> 16:15.280]  Oh, man, go to linode.com slash the talk show and see why Linode has been voted the top
[16:15.280 --> 16:22.720]  infrastructure as a service provider by both G2 and trust radius Linode award winning support
[16:22.720 --> 16:29.200]  offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to every level of user.
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.440]  Even if you're on like a five dollar, ten dollar a month account, you still get their
[16:33.440 --> 16:36.640]  award winning tech support, their ease of use and set up.
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.600]  It is clear why developers and people hosting websites have been trusting Linode for projects,
[16:41.600 --> 16:42.880]  both big and small.
[16:42.880 --> 16:48.960]  Since 2003, almost 20 years of Linode, you can deploy your entire application stack with
[16:48.960 --> 16:55.920]  their one click app marketplace or build it all from scratch and manage everything yourself
[16:55.920 --> 16:58.720]  with supported centralized tools like Terraform.
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.800]  They offer amazing the best price to performance value for all compute instances, including
[17:04.800 --> 17:11.360]  GPUs, block storage, Kubernetes and their upcoming bare metal release.
[17:11.360 --> 17:14.880]  They make cloud computing fast, simple and affordable, allowing you to focus on your
[17:14.880 --> 17:17.760]  projects, not your infrastructure.
[17:17.760 --> 17:21.920]  So visit linode.com slash the talk show Linode.
[17:21.920 --> 17:23.440]  That's where I host during Fireball.
[17:23.440 --> 17:26.080]  I would do that even if they weren't sponsoring the podcast.

[17:44.160 --> 17:48.080]  So iPad sales were down like 14% year over year, quarter to quarter.
[17:48.080 --> 17:54.000]  I didn't realize there were some things I looked up the last time I was on CNBC for
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.640]  one of those little three minute things that I like three minutes of torture for me.
[17:58.640 --> 18:00.640]  I don't know why I ever agreed to do it.
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.480]  I get so stressed out, but I looked up.
[18:02.480 --> 18:08.480]  I remember it was like right after a bunch of the fall October devices came out and it
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.560]  was like the Apple watch was already back ordered into late November.
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.960]  It feels and again, I think it's one of those like Tim Cook things.
[18:16.960 --> 18:18.960]  We just take Tim Cook for granted.
[18:18.960 --> 18:24.800]  The things that he's the best at and operations and the supply chain stuff for all of the
[18:24.800 --> 18:30.160]  hand wringing that everybody around the world went through for supply chain constraints
[18:30.160 --> 18:35.600]  and shipping boats that were backed up outside Los Angeles, waiting for room at the harbor
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.200]  because everything got all backed up.
[18:37.200 --> 18:39.520]  Most in a canal stuck in a canal, right?
[18:39.520 --> 18:45.440]  Somebody actually, that's exactly what would happen by the way, if I ever got, if they
[18:45.440 --> 18:47.200]  ever said, group, take the wheel.
[18:47.200 --> 18:47.920]  Oh my God.
[18:47.920 --> 18:48.960]  And I'd say, are you sure?
[18:48.960 --> 18:50.960]  And they'd say, yeah, five minutes.
[18:50.960 --> 18:52.320]  What could go wrong?
[18:52.320 --> 18:53.120]  Five minutes.
[18:53.120 --> 18:54.080]  Just take the wheel.
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.040]  I got to hit the head.
[18:55.040 --> 18:56.320]  I'll be back in five minutes.
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.760]  Next team appointed straight.
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.800]  Yeah, next thing, you know, you're in a canal.
[19:00.800 --> 19:01.520]  What could go wrong?
[19:02.080 --> 19:04.080]  I've blocked the Suez canal.
[19:04.080 --> 19:04.880]  That would happen.
[19:04.880 --> 19:05.600]  I guarantee it.
[19:05.600 --> 19:08.400]  I cannot, did you ever drive a rental moving truck?
[19:09.440 --> 19:10.080]  Oh yeah.
[19:10.080 --> 19:10.800]  One time.
[19:10.800 --> 19:13.120]  Oh God, it must've been 1999.
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.080]  Amy was moving from Pittsburgh back to Philadelphia and me and a friend were going to rent a truck
[19:20.080 --> 19:26.640]  here in Philadelphia and then drive out to Pittsburgh, load up her stuff and then hit
[19:26.640 --> 19:27.440]  right back.
[19:27.440 --> 19:31.600]  It's, you know, about a five hour drive, maybe a little longer in a rental truck.
[19:31.600 --> 19:33.920]  They don't go, they don't go my speed.
[19:33.920 --> 19:34.320]  No.
[19:34.320 --> 19:39.520]  So a long day, five hours, one way load up a truck, five hours the other way, unload
[19:39.520 --> 19:40.080]  the truck.
[19:40.080 --> 19:43.200]  It was going to be a long day, but better to knock it out.
[19:43.200 --> 19:49.440]  Anyway, I go into morning, I pick up the rental truck and pull out of the lot and it's, I
[19:49.440 --> 19:50.800]  got to make a right-hand turn.
[19:51.520 --> 19:54.880]  And I took the right-hand turn at a light a little too close.
[19:55.520 --> 19:56.400]  Boom hit.
[19:56.400 --> 19:59.120]  I could hear it, the tire hit the, hit the curb, curb.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.200]  And by the time I got to the next corner, I could tell I'd blew the tire right out of
[20:05.200 --> 20:05.600]  the lot.
[20:05.600 --> 20:06.160]  No.
[20:06.160 --> 20:09.280]  So I just went around the block pulled right back into the budget.
[20:09.280 --> 20:10.000]  It was a budget.
[20:10.560 --> 20:12.480]  And I said, Hey, what's the deal?
[20:12.480 --> 20:13.760]  You gave me a lousy tire.
[20:14.320 --> 20:15.680]  You gave me a button tire.
[20:15.680 --> 20:17.360]  And the guy is like, Oh, I'm sorry.
[20:17.360 --> 20:18.000]  I'm so sorry.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.840]  Cause he was the same guy who just gave me the keys about four minutes before.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.720]  I was like, what the hell?
[20:22.720 --> 20:23.760]  I got to get to Pittsburgh.
[20:23.760 --> 20:24.160]  He's hold on.
[20:24.160 --> 20:25.280]  Let me see what else I got.
[20:25.280 --> 20:28.640]  It gives me another truck, but this one didn't look the same.
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.240]  This one was a number is Suzu.
[20:32.240 --> 20:33.680]  They don't, you don't hear about a Suzu.
[20:33.680 --> 20:34.000]  Oh yeah.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.120]  Whatever happened to that company?
[20:35.120 --> 20:35.600]  No, I know.
[20:35.600 --> 20:36.720]  I thought about them the other day.
[20:36.720 --> 20:39.840]  I was like, for some reason, Joe is Suzu popped into my head.
[20:39.840 --> 20:40.240]  Yeah.
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.600]  Now I got to put that in the show notes.
[20:41.600 --> 20:43.520]  What the hell ever happened to Suzu?
[20:43.520 --> 20:47.120]  The other one just looked like the first one looked like a regular budget rental truck.
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.400]  The type of thing you would think you would need to move a 26 year old single woman from
[20:52.400 --> 20:53.760]  Pittsburgh to Philly.
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.360]  Not too big, but not a van.
[20:55.360 --> 20:56.240]  You know, it was a truck.
[20:56.240 --> 20:58.800]  It was like the smallest truck and he gave me an, a Suzu.
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.720]  It was the same size, but it was one of those ones that had no nose.
[21:03.520 --> 21:06.720]  So like you're sitting right over the, you're sitting right over.
[21:06.720 --> 21:07.120]  Yeah.
[21:07.120 --> 21:07.920]  Right over the front.
[21:08.560 --> 21:08.800]  Yeah.
[21:08.800 --> 21:12.960]  And I pick up my friend and we drive and then like the idiots that we are, we stop at the
[21:12.960 --> 21:16.000]  very first rest station to get some food.
[21:16.960 --> 21:17.200]  Yeah.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.560]  It's a long drive to Pittsburgh.
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.400]  And we decided to stop at the first one we get, I don't know, some burgers or something
[21:22.400 --> 21:25.520]  like that and get back in and the thing won't even start.
[21:26.240 --> 21:26.880]  Won't start.
[21:27.760 --> 21:28.960]  Son of a bitch.
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.480]  And it took four or five hours to get, to get a service guy out there to, to change
[21:34.480 --> 21:35.040]  the battery.
[21:35.040 --> 21:37.680]  So now we're like five, six hours behind.
[21:37.680 --> 21:38.720]  Anyway, it all worked out.
[21:38.720 --> 21:40.480]  Also, Amy will verify this.
[21:40.480 --> 21:42.880]  I did on the way back after, this is nighttime.
[21:42.880 --> 21:46.320]  We're driving back from Pittsburgh to Philly, almost drove off a cliff.
[21:46.320 --> 21:49.520]  Okay.
[21:49.520 --> 21:52.480]  They say we had like a wheel or two over the edge.
[21:52.480 --> 21:56.000]  I say it wasn't quite that close, but this is why you can't drive it.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.440]  It's one of the reasons I can.
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.080]  I definitely do not have a truck driver's license.
[22:00.080 --> 22:00.400]  Yeah.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.040]  The crazy thing like I, so I grew up in Connecticut and a Connecticut driver's license, at least
[22:05.040 --> 22:05.440]  for years.
[22:05.440 --> 22:06.560]  I don't know if it's like this anymore.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.800]  It was also considered a limousine driver's license for some reason.
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.000]  I have absolutely no idea.
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.600]  Like I don't, I didn't take some sub-course in limousine driving in order to get my license.
[22:17.600 --> 22:22.000]  But when I went to college, I was looking for like part-time job to try and make some
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.920]  money while I was going to school.
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.160]  And one of the things that I found was driving for the school.
[22:28.160 --> 22:32.720]  They would pay cause they would have sometimes parents, but also like people who were coming
[22:32.720 --> 22:35.840]  to speak at the school and would need a ride from the airport.
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.080]  So they had a van and if you had a Connecticut driver's license, you were licensed to drive
[22:40.080 --> 22:40.720]  the van.
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.480]  And so I drove the van.
[22:42.480 --> 22:45.280]  Like I had no special skills.
[22:45.280 --> 22:47.840]  I have no idea how that happened.
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.720]  And I feel kind of lucky that nobody got injured while I was driving that van.
[22:53.280 --> 22:53.760]  Huh.
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.400]  That's, you know, that's very funny because my friend, John is also named John.
[22:58.400 --> 23:01.120]  John, my roommate from college who was...
[23:01.120 --> 23:02.480]  Should have him on the podcast with me.
[23:02.480 --> 23:03.200]  I should.
[23:03.200 --> 23:04.720]  We all know confusion at all.
[23:04.720 --> 23:05.360]  No, none.
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.920]  My friend, John, who was the guy who went with me out to Pittsburgh and very...
[23:09.920 --> 23:11.040]  What a friend, right?
[23:11.040 --> 23:13.920]  What a friend who's willing to ride all the way to Pittsburgh to help.
[23:13.920 --> 23:14.400]  No, yeah.
[23:14.400 --> 23:16.400]  Any friend that helps you move, that's a solid...
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.880]  But a day trip from Philly to Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh round trip, that's a hell of a
[23:20.880 --> 23:21.360]  thing.
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.680]  But anyway, he had a job in college.
[23:23.680 --> 23:27.440]  Now Drexel and Penn are right next to each other, big shared border.
[23:27.440 --> 23:32.560]  It's effectively one big, you know, conglomerate of college campus.
[23:33.280 --> 23:38.240]  And he was a van driver for the University of Pennsylvania.
[23:38.240 --> 23:41.680]  Even though we went to Drexel, he got a job at Penn driving like the...
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.240]  You know, you just like sort of have like a route and you just stop.
[23:46.240 --> 23:48.640]  It's like a bus, but it was a van and you'd stop.
[23:48.640 --> 23:52.640]  And if college, you know, kids at Penn had student ID, they could just get on for free
[23:52.640 --> 23:54.400]  and ride around.
[23:54.400 --> 23:56.560]  Well, anyway, he liked it.
[23:56.560 --> 23:57.520]  He enjoyed the job.
[23:57.520 --> 23:59.200]  It paid good money, I guess.
[23:59.200 --> 24:04.320]  But one time he hit somebody, but it was absolutely not his fault.
[24:04.320 --> 24:10.160]  It was like an intoxicated college student who ran in front of his van.
[24:10.160 --> 24:12.080]  And there were all sorts of witnesses.
[24:12.080 --> 24:16.160]  It was like a Friday night at nine o'clock, all sorts of witnesses.
[24:16.160 --> 24:18.240]  And he was in no legal trouble.
[24:18.800 --> 24:21.200]  And everybody agreed it was the kid's fault.
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.680]  The kid who got hit, I think it was a girl, but even she admitted it was her fault.
[24:25.680 --> 24:27.280]  And it's still he got fired.
[24:27.280 --> 24:28.400]  It was company policy.
[24:28.400 --> 24:29.840]  As soon as you hit somebody, you're fired.
[24:29.840 --> 24:36.720]  And so he lost his job, even though it wasn't his fault.
[24:36.720 --> 24:38.960]  They even said to him, they're like, that's a tough one.
[24:38.960 --> 24:41.680]  Cause it really, this one, it's usually not so clear cut.
[24:41.680 --> 24:42.880]  This one wasn't your fault.
[24:42.880 --> 24:44.240]  Policy's policy.
[24:44.240 --> 24:46.640]  You know, you know, who should have that policy is Spotify.
[24:50.640 --> 24:51.520]  If you hit somebody.
[24:51.520 --> 25:00.160]  Or if you spew COVID nonsense for years on end.
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.320]  Yeah, maybe.
[25:02.320 --> 25:02.640]  All right.
[25:02.640 --> 25:03.200]  What else?
[25:03.200 --> 25:04.640]  What, anything else stick out from you?
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.000]  Oh, the max sales were up.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.160]  And that's of course, I also, I don't think you have to be a Jim Cramer.
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.360]  You don't have to be a deep thinker of wall street to figure out what's going on.
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.320]  The M1 max came out at the beginning of last year, end of 2020.
[25:20.320 --> 25:25.760]  They're incredibly well reviewed and all they've hercalated throughout the lineup
[25:25.760 --> 25:28.640]  to all of the most popular models.
[25:28.640 --> 25:34.080]  The only remaining ones are the big iMac and the professional Mac pro.
[25:34.080 --> 25:36.160]  And yeah, it's not surprising.
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.680]  Max sales are up record breaking more max being sold in a quarter than ever before.
[25:41.680 --> 25:43.360]  Although they, again, they don't break down.
[25:44.000 --> 25:44.960]  Units anymore.
[25:44.960 --> 25:47.120]  So we can't say, but at least by revenue.
[25:47.760 --> 25:48.000]  Yeah.
[25:48.640 --> 25:48.880]  Yeah.
[25:48.880 --> 25:50.880]  I think, right, it doesn't not seem surprising.
[25:50.880 --> 25:54.000]  And then they also said like the last, gosh, now I can't remember the number.
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.640]  Six quarters were the best six quarters for the Mac ever.
[26:00.640 --> 26:06.480]  Yeah, because it was, there was an unusual thing where part of us like people who like us
[26:06.480 --> 26:10.480]  are like, what kind of an idiot would buy an Intel Mac in September?
[26:10.480 --> 26:12.800]  When you knew that Apple Silicon was going.
[26:12.800 --> 26:17.120]  But they had a record breaking quarter, like the last quarter of max sales before they
[26:17.120 --> 26:21.200]  even announced the transition, even though they announced the transition was coming at
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.040]  WWDC already, it was as much as Apple ever talks about the future.
[26:25.040 --> 26:28.400]  But yeah, people six, six quarters is a year and a half.
[26:28.400 --> 26:35.920]  So I think what that times two is the period after, I mean, for a while, Apple kind of
[26:35.920 --> 26:37.200]  screwed the Mac up, right?
[26:38.640 --> 26:45.040]  I mean, the Mac book pro, the keyboard things, the touch bar, the lack of a retina Mac book
[26:45.040 --> 26:45.680]  air.
[26:45.680 --> 26:51.760]  Yeah, I mean, all these things probably depressed Mac sales to some degree for a while.
[26:51.760 --> 26:58.080]  And once they address those issues, I think it, I think that probably helped a lot.
[26:58.080 --> 26:59.280]  Yeah, I do too.
[26:59.280 --> 26:59.600]  Yeah.
[26:59.600 --> 27:04.000]  And I do think, I don't think it was so much that the company had lost interest in the
[27:04.000 --> 27:04.320]  Mac.
[27:04.320 --> 27:05.280]  I just think they knew.
[27:05.280 --> 27:07.040]  I think they were just going in the wrong direction.
[27:07.040 --> 27:12.000]  Well, and I think they knew this transition was coming and they were like, so do we really
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.520]  want to do X before we actually make this transition?
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.400]  Why don't we save it?
[27:16.400 --> 27:20.800]  And they have good ideas for things to do with the Mac and Mac hardware.
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.040]  Why don't we save it for when we do Apple Silicon?
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.280]  And then some of the things really depend on it.
[27:25.280 --> 27:31.120]  Like the fact that you get a much, much better, significantly better FaceTime camera for video
[27:31.120 --> 27:36.560]  conference calls and whatever else you use your MacBook camera for, you get such better
[27:36.560 --> 27:41.440]  picture out of it because it gets the image processing pipeline of Apple Silicon.
[27:41.440 --> 27:46.080]  Like the first round of like the still for sale, like if you buy the MacBook Air with
[27:46.080 --> 27:50.080]  an M1, it's literally has the same camera as the Intel ones.
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.520]  And the picture looks like 10 times better because it's better chips.
[27:56.080 --> 27:56.480]  I don't know.
[27:56.480 --> 28:02.560]  I feel like even with the Mac Pro that there was sort of a, oh, you know, it's like, we
[28:02.560 --> 28:03.680]  really have to do something.
[28:03.680 --> 28:09.120]  This trashcan design isn't working, but do we really want to throw all of the effort
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.880]  into going with one generation of Xeon, do all of this, and then we're going to throw
[28:14.880 --> 28:15.280]  it all out.
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.280]  And they're like, oh, okay, I guess we have to.
[28:17.280 --> 28:19.520]  It's in like the iMac Pro is like that.
[28:19.520 --> 28:22.240]  The iMac Pro was like, it still is.
[28:22.240 --> 28:27.440]  It's like a technical marvel of cooling that there you have these chips that even Intel
[28:27.440 --> 28:32.800]  admits runs hot and they've got like this real svelte form factor and it doesn't make
[28:32.800 --> 28:33.600]  a lot of noise.
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.440]  And they made one of them.
[28:35.440 --> 28:44.720]  And it's, I'm sure that it's not like that their Macs hardware engineers have developed
[28:44.720 --> 28:52.640]  muscles for designing and implementing cooling systems that aren't applicable in the Apple
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.440]  Silicon world.
[28:53.440 --> 28:54.240]  I'm sure they are.
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.560]  And it's look at how thin the M1 24 inch iMac is.
[28:58.560 --> 29:04.160]  The fact that it's so crazy thin with no pimple or bulge anywhere on the back.
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.480]  The fact that they've, they honed their chops making cooling systems like the iMac Pro 1,
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.600]  but still it's, it really, you can see why they were, I just think that they were hoping
[29:13.600 --> 29:18.640]  that maybe the Apple Silicon transition would happen a year or two earlier than it actually
[29:18.640 --> 29:18.960]  did.
[29:18.960 --> 29:26.080]  And no one would notice that these Pro Macs were getting long in the tooth.
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.040]  You know, and I don't know how much of the keyboard delay, what clearly in hindsight
[29:31.040 --> 29:33.120]  looks like procrastination on their part.
[29:33.120 --> 29:36.320]  Like the problem isn't that they tried these butterfly keyboards.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.360]  It made sense.
[29:37.360 --> 29:41.360]  And you know, some people like less travel or more travel on their keys, but once it
[29:41.360 --> 29:44.800]  turned out that breadcrumbs and stuff were all of a sudden you're destroying it, yeah,
[29:44.800 --> 29:45.920]  destroying your B key.
[29:45.920 --> 29:50.240]  And the answer was, well, you needed a whole new top case that should have been replaced
[29:50.240 --> 29:51.280]  sooner than it was.
[29:51.280 --> 29:56.240]  And Apple to their credit as a company tends to, it's not that they don't make mistakes,
[29:56.240 --> 29:59.920]  but they tend to rectify mistakes somewhat quickly.
[29:59.920 --> 30:00.800]  This isn't working.
[30:00.800 --> 30:01.840]  Let's do something different.
[30:01.840 --> 30:05.680]  Whereas they stuck with a bunch of Mac stuff for years when they shouldn't have.
[30:05.680 --> 30:09.840]  And I just don't think it's a coincidence that they had this transition on the horizon
[30:09.840 --> 30:11.840]  and sort of wanted to save the good stuff for it.
[30:12.480 --> 30:17.760]  And I know people who held on to Macbook, older Macbook Pros for years and completely
[30:17.760 --> 30:20.400]  skipped that generation just because of the things that they had heard about it.
[30:20.400 --> 30:21.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[30:21.520 --> 30:24.960]  Because like you might be thinking like, hey, my MacBook's getting kind of slow.
[30:24.960 --> 30:28.400]  And you think, but I've never once had a single problem with the keyboard.
[30:28.400 --> 30:29.920]  And you hear all these problems, right?
[30:30.960 --> 30:31.440]  Yeah, right.
[30:31.440 --> 30:36.000]  Like, I mean, I think that was at one point during the keyboard saga, I even wrote that.
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.080]  And it's like, you can talk about whatever they say that most of our customers have no
[30:40.080 --> 30:40.880]  complaints, whatever.
[30:40.880 --> 30:45.840]  But it's like, I've been using computers, just computers, period, as long as I can remember.
[30:46.400 --> 30:49.200]  And I just don't ever remember where there was a problem.
[30:49.200 --> 30:53.600]  Like when you're typing, where like you'd try to type one S and you'd get three of them
[30:53.600 --> 30:54.560]  or something like that.
[30:54.560 --> 31:00.240]  It just never happened with anybody's computer, you know, like, yeah, it just, it was a problem.
[31:00.240 --> 31:03.200]  It's also, it's also the number of ports too, I think.
[31:03.200 --> 31:03.760]  Yeah.
[31:03.760 --> 31:04.800]  Yeah, that was true.
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.000]  But anyway, it was a good year for the Mac corresponding, right?
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.040]  Like reviewers and nerds like us look at these new Macs that Apple's coming out with Apple
[31:13.040 --> 31:15.920]  Silicon and we say, these are excellent computers.
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.560]  And it seems people, tens of millions of people who are in the market for them agree.
[31:20.560 --> 31:21.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:22.240 --> 31:25.360]  The other things, the other two things that I noticed were both related.
[31:25.360 --> 31:29.120]  They said that around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were
[31:29.120 --> 31:34.160]  new to the product and also two thirds of the customers purchasing an Apple Watch were
[31:34.160 --> 31:35.120]  new to the product.
[31:35.120 --> 31:38.480]  That's another one too, where I feel like people just buy one and then they're going
[31:38.480 --> 31:40.080]  to keep it for years and years.
[31:40.080 --> 31:42.080]  Cause that's how people think of their watches.
[31:42.080 --> 31:46.880]  I don't even remember which one my, my, I forgot which model I have.
[31:46.880 --> 31:51.280]  I can't, it's definitely a few years old, but I can't remember which model it is.
[31:51.280 --> 31:53.280]  Which is, I think it's a five.
[31:53.280 --> 31:53.600]  Yeah.
[31:53.600 --> 31:55.200]  I think that's the way it should be though.
[31:55.200 --> 31:56.160]  I really do.
[31:56.160 --> 32:01.440]  And, but that really speaks to, especially with the iPad, so sales are down.
[32:01.440 --> 32:03.680]  Half of them were new to me.
[32:03.680 --> 32:08.640]  It just says that there are just tens and tens, maybe hundreds of millions of people
[32:08.640 --> 32:11.520]  with iPads who are just like, I'm good.
[32:11.520 --> 32:11.920]  Yeah.
[32:11.920 --> 32:16.320]  I think the amazing thing to me about the iPad line is that eponymous iPad, because
[32:17.280 --> 32:22.480]  you can get them for, they go down to like two 30 or something like that at Costco.
[32:22.480 --> 32:27.280]  I mean, that is, that is a lot of machine for that amount of money.
[32:27.280 --> 32:30.000]  That is probably the best value that Apple offers.
[32:30.000 --> 32:30.240]  Yeah.
[32:30.240 --> 32:34.880]  I think that, I think they, the official retail price is three 29, but yeah, they
[32:34.880 --> 32:37.840]  definitely dip below maybe it's more like two 70 or something like that.
[32:37.840 --> 32:39.920]  They go below 300 bang for the buck.
[32:39.920 --> 32:42.880]  It is really just remarkable.
[32:42.880 --> 32:46.640]  And it goes against the, everything Apple makes is expensive.
[32:46.640 --> 32:47.520]  It's like that.
[32:47.520 --> 32:47.920]  I don't know.
[32:47.920 --> 32:50.400]  I dare, I dare you to find a better computer.
[32:50.400 --> 32:56.240]  Maybe you don't like iPad OS and for whatever reasons, but in terms of.
[32:56.240 --> 32:56.480]  Yeah.
[32:56.480 --> 33:01.120]  That's not to say there aren't knocks on it compared to other devices, but dollar for
[33:01.120 --> 33:04.080]  dollar, I don't think you're going to get a better value.
[33:04.080 --> 33:05.520]  Karen has one cash.
[33:05.520 --> 33:08.480]  She's got one that's a year and a half old, something like that.
[33:08.480 --> 33:08.640]  Yeah.
[33:08.640 --> 33:09.760]  I think it's about a year and a half old.
[33:09.760 --> 33:14.160]  And I was just like thinking maybe she, for Christmas, maybe she was like a new one.
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.520]  She was not interested.
[33:16.960 --> 33:18.320]  She's like, it's great.
[33:18.320 --> 33:19.520]  It does everything that I want.
[33:19.520 --> 33:22.080]  She even doesn't mind the old pencil, particularly.
[33:22.080 --> 33:26.960]  I mean, I'm sure if she got a new one, she'd like the new one better, but she was perfectly
[33:26.960 --> 33:27.200]  happy.
[33:27.200 --> 33:30.640]  And I was just like, well, I spent, I spent a few hundred bucks on stunning, like just
[33:30.640 --> 33:33.200]  shoving something in front of her because it's a new.
[33:33.200 --> 33:33.440]  Yeah.
[33:34.080 --> 33:39.040]  Anything stand out from you from the analyst call the, this is Tim, the transcript?
[33:39.840 --> 33:40.720]  Not much for me.
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.680]  I guess the news people are focusing on is that he said there's 1.8.
[33:45.680 --> 33:45.920]  Yeah.
[33:45.920 --> 33:47.040]  That's what I was going to say.
[33:47.040 --> 33:49.280]  Billion devices, Apple devices in use.
[33:49.280 --> 33:51.600]  I'm not quite sure what they count as a device.
[33:51.600 --> 33:52.240]  Yeah.
[33:52.240 --> 33:53.760]  And how they were in use.
[33:53.760 --> 33:55.440]  Cause to me, that's the question.
[33:55.440 --> 33:58.800]  If you're just, if it's still signed into iCloud or something like that.
[33:58.800 --> 33:59.040]  Okay.
[33:59.920 --> 34:02.880]  I'm not sure if that really counts because I have a lot of devices that are still signed
[34:02.880 --> 34:03.600]  into iCloud.
[34:03.600 --> 34:06.400]  Does my Apple TV remote control count as a device?
[34:08.800 --> 34:09.920]  I doubt it.
[34:09.920 --> 34:10.720]  I doubt that.
[34:10.720 --> 34:12.640]  I doubt the remote control counts as a device.
[34:12.640 --> 34:13.360]  The TV does.
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.480]  The TV does, but the mouse connected to my iMac or whatever does not count as a separate
[34:18.480 --> 34:19.040]  device.
[34:19.040 --> 34:23.520]  It's a lot for a planet with only, I believe 7 billion people.
[34:23.520 --> 34:27.120]  That's the last I checked, but yeah, it's been a few years since it looked.
[34:27.120 --> 34:27.600]  It's weird.
[34:27.600 --> 34:29.280]  Cause it's like you internalize things.
[34:29.280 --> 34:34.160]  I just remember like when I first became aware of the population of the earth, it was 5 billion.
[34:34.160 --> 34:34.480]  Yep.
[34:34.480 --> 34:35.040]  Me too.
[34:35.040 --> 34:35.920]  Me too.
[34:35.920 --> 34:36.480]  Exactly.
[34:36.480 --> 34:41.120]  We're similar age and I just thought that's the number.
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.040]  And then it's talking about 6 billion.
[34:43.040 --> 34:44.400]  I'm like, nope, 5 billion.
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.680]  And then it's, Oh, I see how it works.
[34:49.680 --> 34:50.640]  It goes up pretty quick.
[34:51.840 --> 34:52.480]  So I don't know.
[34:52.480 --> 34:54.480]  It could be 13 billion at this point.
[34:54.480 --> 34:56.000]  I just, I haven't paid attention.
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.280]  I believe it's 7 billion.
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.520]  So with a planet of 7 billion people, 1.8 billion devices in use is pretty good reach
[35:03.520 --> 35:06.160]  for a company that was formerly beleaguered.
[35:07.200 --> 35:10.720]  Let me take a break here and I will thank our next sponsor.
[35:10.720 --> 35:11.520]  Oh man.
[35:11.520 --> 35:17.520]  I, you wouldn't even believe how much Mack Weldon clothing I have on right now.
[35:17.520 --> 35:17.920]  Yeah.
[35:17.920 --> 35:18.480]  Oh yeah.
[35:18.480 --> 35:20.000]  Cause I'm freezing.
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.560]  And so I've gone the layered route.
[35:24.560 --> 35:32.000]  I believe I'm wearing, I've got their cotton t-shirt on and then I've got a, uh, the ACE
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.320]  sweatshirt and then I've got the ACE hoodie on top of my ACE sweatshirt.
[35:36.320 --> 35:37.680]  Oh man, Mack Weldon.
[35:37.680 --> 35:40.640]  They did look, their stuff looks great.
[35:40.640 --> 35:42.480]  You want to look good in the winter Mack Weldon.
[35:42.480 --> 35:43.280]  They're the experts.
[35:43.280 --> 35:46.560]  When it comes to essential clothing, that's perfect for the cold.
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.800]  Oh man, this sponsor read is right.
[35:48.800 --> 35:53.600]  What I need, whether you need a legit warm shirt or looking to upgrade your sweats collection,
[35:53.600 --> 35:55.440]  Mack Weldon has exactly what you're looking for.
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.760]  And if that's not convenient enough, they've got the daily wear system.
[35:59.760 --> 36:02.080]  All the clothes work together for real.
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.000]  So whether you're headed to work and you need to look professional or you're going for a
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.080]  run, or you're just sitting around on the couch and you really want the sweatpants getting
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.160]  dressed takes no effort at all.
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.880]  They've got the ACE sweatshirts, the sweatpants.
[36:14.880 --> 36:18.640]  I'm not a sweatpants guy, but Syracuse had talked me into trying them years ago.
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.800]  If you got to have some sweatpants, I have to say they're the best sweatpants I've ever
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.160]  had there because they don't look like sweatpants from when I was younger.
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.480]  They look, you look a little bit less like you're in pajamas and you look like you can
[36:30.480 --> 36:32.160]  go somewhere and they got nice pockets.
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.600]  They're actually useful.
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.520]  Whereas back in the day, you put anything in sweatpants pockets, it's going to fall
[36:37.520 --> 36:37.840]  out.
[36:37.840 --> 36:40.000]  Now their stuff stays together.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.920]  They got the warm knit collection.
[36:41.920 --> 36:42.480]  Oh man.
[36:42.480 --> 36:44.560]  The warm knit stuff is I don't know how they do it.
[36:44.560 --> 36:47.360]  It's like some kind of scientific fabric, but it keeps you warm.
[36:47.360 --> 36:52.400]  They got like a flannel shirts and stuff like that are made out of the warm knit fabric.
[36:52.400 --> 36:53.120]  Very warm.
[36:53.680 --> 36:55.680]  And of course they've got underwear and socks.
[36:55.680 --> 36:58.160]  I've got one pair of Mack Weldon underwear.
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.880]  I wear it every single day and it nothing ever goes wrong with it.
[37:02.880 --> 37:03.920]  No, I kid.
[37:05.440 --> 37:07.120]  I've got a whole drawer full.
[37:07.120 --> 37:08.720]  I'm not going to ask how often you do laundry.
[37:09.280 --> 37:11.920]  I've got a whole drawer full of Mack Weldon underwear.
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.160]  I do not just wear the same pair every day, but you could if you wanted to.
[37:16.160 --> 37:17.600]  The stuff really lasts it.
[37:17.600 --> 37:22.160]  Anyway, everything from your sock and undied drawer to sweatshirts and this warm stuff,
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.160]  man, they have so much warm stuff.
[37:24.160 --> 37:25.680]  Oh, it is great layers.
[37:25.680 --> 37:26.880]  That's the secret to winter.
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.800]  Go there, go to Mack Weldon and you can get to save 20% off your first order by going
[37:32.800 --> 37:40.400]  to m-a-c-k-w-e-l-d-o-n, mackweldon.com slash the talk show.
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.240]  And just remember, I think if you just go to the URL, it's pre-entered, but the promo
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.640]  code is the talk show and that's what gets you 20% off.
[37:48.640 --> 37:51.360]  You can find your perfect look for this winter.
[37:51.920 --> 37:53.680]  Don't forget the slippers.
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.720]  I've got them on right now.
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.720]  They're keeping my feet toasty warm.
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.160]  My feet are actually not cold.
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.600]  My feet get cold all the time.
[37:59.600 --> 38:03.360]  Oh yeah, not with warm Mack Weldon socks and these damn slippers.
[38:03.360 --> 38:05.440]  Oh, I don't think I have the socks.
[38:05.440 --> 38:06.400]  I'm going to try the socks.
[38:06.400 --> 38:06.960]  Oh man.
[38:07.600 --> 38:08.480]  Anyway, great stuff.
[38:08.480 --> 38:09.360]  I love Mack Weldon.
[38:09.360 --> 38:10.000]  What else we got?
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.280]  What's next on the agenda?
[38:11.280 --> 38:14.160]  We've got, I wanted to talk about the, the OSs.
[38:14.160 --> 38:20.640]  So it seems like it's funny because I feel like poor iOS 15.3 and Mac OS 12.2, which
[38:20.640 --> 38:22.080]  just came out like two days ago.
[38:24.880 --> 38:25.840]  Not long for the world.
[38:25.840 --> 38:30.640]  We never had a chance to talk about you guys because there, there aren't a lot of
[38:30.640 --> 38:31.920]  new features in either of them.
[38:31.920 --> 38:35.680]  They feel very bug fixy sort of stability releases.
[38:35.680 --> 38:44.720]  And the next versions of both Mac OS 12.3 and iOS 15.4, both have a bunch of features.
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.000]  This sort of new Apple past the new year.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.320]  This is when we dropped some extra cool stuff.
[38:52.320 --> 38:57.040]  Like two years ago is when the keyboard support and the mouse pointer, the little
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.960]  circle thing for iPad OS dropped out of the blue unannounced.
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.360]  I don't think any, I don't think any of these features are surprises like that, but
[39:05.360 --> 39:06.000]  universal.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.920]  I mean, these, these were supposed to come in the fall or at least not that, not the
[39:09.920 --> 39:10.880]  face mask thing, right?
[39:10.880 --> 39:11.840]  I don't think that was announced.
[39:11.840 --> 39:12.320]  Yeah.
[39:12.320 --> 39:15.200]  I guess the universal control was supposed to come in the fall.
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.840]  Well, they don't tell you when it's supposed to come anymore.
[39:17.840 --> 39:21.520]  Like I think that they're hoping, I think they've, everything they announced in June,
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.120]  they're sort of like, we, we hope it all comes in September, October.
[39:25.120 --> 39:30.160]  Yeah, I guess it's, it's more like, these are things coming in this real, this number
[39:30.160 --> 39:33.920]  of the software and the number of the software will come in the fall.
[39:33.920 --> 39:41.120]  The Swift playgrounds for making full fledged apps that you could submit to the app
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.000]  store, right from Swift playgrounds that just shipped.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.720]  I think in December, I think it was before Christmas, but there's a guy who did that
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.320]  app to don't, which is by supposedly the first app in the app store that was built
[39:54.320 --> 39:56.400]  that way and nobody disputes it.
[39:56.400 --> 40:00.000]  So it probably is, but you know, that's a similar type feature where they announced
[40:00.000 --> 40:01.200]  it at WWDC.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.360]  They don't say like coming in September, they just say it's coming.
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.920]  And you know, it came in December, not September, whatever.
[40:07.920 --> 40:08.480]  It took a while.
[40:09.200 --> 40:16.000]  Universal control was, if not the star of WWDC last year, it was certainly a star.
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.080]  Federighi was the demo-er showing how you could move your mouse from, you put your,
[40:22.080 --> 40:27.120]  set up your iPad right next to your MacBook and use your trackpad on your Mac to move
[40:27.120 --> 40:30.160]  the mouse cursor over the screen, over to the iPad.
[40:30.160 --> 40:32.560]  And now you're dealing with iPad apps.
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.240]  It's one of those WTF demos, right?
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.080]  Like your mind is slightly blown by what they're showing you.
[40:40.640 --> 40:40.880]  Right.
[40:40.880 --> 40:47.120]  So I have not tried it firsthand because A, there was no in-person WWDC where they would
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.960]  have had some kind of early version set up perhaps for the media.
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.600]  And B, I don't have spare machines to install all these betas on.
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.760]  Although I would throw my iPad, going back to what we said about the iPad not really
[40:59.760 --> 41:05.760]  being essential to me, I would put the beta or an alpha, I'd put anything on the iPad.
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.240]  That's usually where I put the first, yeah, like the, you know, first betas.
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.160]  But people who are braver than me and have installed it across the board, I think Joe
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.800]  Rossignol, Rossignol, I don't know, I'll go Rossignol.
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.400]  At MacRumors has a video out and he seems very impressed.
[41:22.400 --> 41:27.600]  It certainly sounds cool, but it's not using your iPad as a secondary screen and you move
[41:27.600 --> 41:28.720]  Mac windows over there.
[41:28.720 --> 41:30.160]  We've had that for a while.
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.560]  This is actually like you just run your cursor over to the side and now your Mac trackpad
[41:34.560 --> 41:37.600]  is controlling your iPad running iPad apps.
[41:37.600 --> 41:38.320]  Very cool.
[41:38.320 --> 41:41.680]  I'm not sure if I have a use case for it, particularly.
[41:41.680 --> 41:49.760]  I use, I do use the iPad as a, like a, oh, like a Wacom tablet sort of thing.
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.280]  I do that a fair amount for making, like doing design stuff in Affinity Designer.
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.800]  And that I love and get a lot of use out of, but I'm not sure, I haven't figured out
[42:00.800 --> 42:02.480]  what I would use this for exactly yet.
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.440]  Yeah, I don't know either, but on the other hand, Apple must think it's going to be
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.240]  useful because it seems like it would, it's hard enough to do.
[42:12.240 --> 42:16.640]  I mean, I guess if you're sitting at a desk and you have multiple devices, I can see how
[42:16.640 --> 42:21.280]  you don't want to like set up an ergonomic nightmare where you're suddenly having to
[42:21.280 --> 42:22.480]  reach out for your iPad.
[42:22.480 --> 42:26.560]  When you're using your Mac, you just move your mouse over and you can use the iPad.
[42:26.560 --> 42:30.000]  So I can see, I can see how it might be useful, but I don't probably don't set up that way
[42:30.000 --> 42:30.480]  very much.
[42:31.120 --> 42:36.160]  Color me intrigued to play with it and color me skeptical that I have a need for it.
[42:36.160 --> 42:41.840]  Cause I also feel, and I know that there's stuff like the, under the umbrella name continuity.
[42:41.840 --> 42:45.600]  There's very cool features that have been around for years now where you, if you copy
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.840]  something on your iPhone, you can paste it on your iPad or your Mac.
[42:49.840 --> 42:54.800]  And it works just well enough that I assume it's going to work, but at least once a
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.760]  week, it doesn't.
[42:55.760 --> 42:59.680]  And it's, you copy it on your iPad and you go to your Mac and you paste thinking you're
[42:59.680 --> 43:05.360]  going to paste this URL you just copied and you get whatever crappy nonsense, whatever
[43:05.360 --> 43:08.720]  the random thing that used to be on your Mac clipboard is still there.
[43:08.720 --> 43:09.200]  I don't know.
[43:09.200 --> 43:10.640]  It doesn't work perfectly.
[43:10.640 --> 43:14.080]  That's the thing that I, yeah, it makes me a little bit leery of it as well.
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.280]  One of the things that drives me absolutely crazy, like little bugs like that drive me
[43:17.280 --> 43:17.520]  crazy.
[43:17.520 --> 43:21.840]  And one of the things that drives me berserk currently is when you have the automatic
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.040]  switching on for AirPods and I'm watching something like, cause I have a desk with my
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.440]  Mac mini that has my Plex server on it.
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.400]  And sometimes it'll be watching something and doing something on my air, my MacBook
[43:34.400 --> 43:40.240]  air and list, but listening to something on the Mac mini and a notification comes in like
[43:40.240 --> 43:46.560]  email, like an email comes in or a text comes in and it switches the audio input to the
[43:46.560 --> 43:46.880]  air.
[43:46.880 --> 43:48.720]  And that drives me absolutely bonkers.
[43:48.720 --> 43:51.440]  I wish there was a setting where it's like, don't do system alerts.
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.520]  If I, if I suddenly stop listening to, you know, stop watching when I'm watching on the
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.840]  mini and switch over to listening to music on my air, sure, do that.
[43:59.840 --> 44:02.320]  But like an email comes in, I don't care.
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.200]  I don't stop everything just because an email came in.
[44:06.000 --> 44:06.240]  Ching.
[44:07.040 --> 44:07.280]  Yeah.
[44:07.920 --> 44:10.640]  Or a text, they come in all the time.
[44:10.640 --> 44:12.800]  I think the ATP guys have talked about this.
[44:12.800 --> 44:17.840]  I forget which, which of them, one of them continues to insist on trying to use it.
[44:17.840 --> 44:22.080]  And I think Syracuse is the pessimist who says, don't even do it.
[44:22.080 --> 44:23.280]  I have it turned on.
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.760]  I still do, but I get frustrated when it goes the wrong way.
[44:27.760 --> 44:34.720]  And for me, it's often when I want to make like a phone call using my AirPods, which
[44:34.720 --> 44:35.280]  I love.
[44:35.280 --> 44:37.440]  I just love hearing it in both ears.
[44:37.440 --> 44:42.160]  I just feel like I actually hear the person so much better when I use my AirPods for a
[44:42.160 --> 44:42.640]  phone call.
[44:43.360 --> 44:50.080]  And I don't have, famously, I don't have a lot of like work phone calls, but man, oh
[44:50.080 --> 44:54.320]  man, whenever one does, it seems like that, Oh, somebody's going to call me to talk about
[44:54.320 --> 44:57.200]  something and okay, we'll do it at two o'clock on Tuesday.
[44:57.200 --> 44:59.920]  And it's scheduled and I want to be professional.
[44:59.920 --> 45:05.120]  And then here it is 1 59 and my AirPods will not disconnect from my Mac.
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.480]  And there's nothing like close the lid.
[45:08.480 --> 45:10.560]  I don't know, put this to sleep, shut it down.
[45:10.560 --> 45:11.280]  What do I do?
[45:11.280 --> 45:12.320]  How do I fix this?
[45:12.320 --> 45:18.400]  And it seems like when it's, if there's no pressure involved, if it's just me listening
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.280]  to a podcast on my own, it just all works perfectly.
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.320]  And when I know that somebody is going to call me 15 seconds from now, I cannot make
[45:26.320 --> 45:28.000]  it switch to my iPhone.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.880]  And instead it's playing beeps and boops from my Mac.
[45:30.880 --> 45:34.160]  And then I think to myself, why did I ever even say, why don't I just keep them on my
[45:34.160 --> 45:34.880]  phone all the time?
[45:35.600 --> 45:36.240]  I don't know.
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.760]  So it's stuff like that that makes me leery of things like this, because I think it looks
[45:41.760 --> 45:45.680]  good, but is it going to work like, or is there going to be something that's just going
[45:45.680 --> 45:47.040]  to drive me absolutely crazy about it?
[45:47.040 --> 45:49.520]  And usually they iron that stuff out over time.
[45:49.520 --> 45:58.560]  It's so close to being good, but the gold standard is wired headphones where you know
[45:58.560 --> 45:59.920]  exactly what's going to happen.
[45:59.920 --> 46:03.200]  Like it gets back to the keyboard thing from before too, right?
[46:03.200 --> 46:10.960]  Where like 99.9% keyboard accuracy, like where you press the E key, do you get an E isn't
[46:10.960 --> 46:11.680]  good enough.
[46:11.680 --> 46:13.280]  99.9 isn't good enough.
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.400]  You really literally, you know, you should be able to use a computer nonstop every day
[46:18.400 --> 46:19.360]  for six years.
[46:19.360 --> 46:24.080]  And every single time you press E you get one E that's what wired headphones are like.
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.280]  You plug it in and it's like, you know, which device it's going to.
[46:27.280 --> 46:27.780]  Yeah.
[46:28.480 --> 46:31.040]  Says me, a guy I'm a big fan of the wireless headphones.
[46:31.040 --> 46:31.520]  I love them.
[46:31.520 --> 46:32.320]  Yeah, me too.
[46:32.320 --> 46:35.520]  I mean, I, I, and I'm so glad to be rid of wires, honestly.
[46:35.520 --> 46:41.120]  Like I, I mean, when podcasting, I'm connected with wires and this, these headphones are
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.800]  not super old, but they're already like janky at the connector part at the port because
[46:46.800 --> 46:49.600]  like I have to, and I have to, every time I sit down to podcast, I have to fiddle with
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.360]  it to make sure that I'm getting the full audio.
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.120]  So I don't like wires and I particularly don't like audio wires.
[46:55.120 --> 46:58.480]  And there's, there's so many other things to love about AirPods, but it's just that
[46:58.480 --> 47:01.360]  one that automatic switching thing is not, it's not perfect.
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.760]  Again, it's just frustrating because nothing short of a hundred percent accuracy is going
[47:05.760 --> 47:06.800]  to be satisfying.
[47:06.800 --> 47:10.800]  And a hundred percent accuracy sort of requires the AirPods to read your mind.
[47:13.200 --> 47:14.240]  So I get it.
[47:14.240 --> 47:17.440]  I just need one more setting, which is ignore system alerts.
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.600]  We were talking about how cold it is.
[47:19.600 --> 47:20.400]  It is very cold.
[47:20.400 --> 47:23.040]  It's winter here and you got to go out with winter coat.
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.520]  And so many people now seem to have AirPods or other wireless headphones.
[47:27.520 --> 47:31.840]  But now when I do see somebody like at the grocery store with a winter coat and like
[47:31.840 --> 47:38.160]  the actual cable snaking under their coat or out of their pocket, it's buddy, you really
[47:38.160 --> 47:39.200]  just a hundred bucks.
[47:39.200 --> 47:43.840]  You know, how about, how about the there's new emoji or emojis?
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.800]  People used to make fun of me cause I would pluralize emoji to emojis and people would
[47:48.800 --> 47:54.080]  make fun of me and say that it was one of the many things I, because it's Japanese.
[47:54.080 --> 47:54.720]  It's Japanese.
[47:54.720 --> 47:56.000]  There's no plural in Japanese.
[47:56.000 --> 47:56.640]  Yeah.
[47:56.640 --> 47:56.800]  Yeah.
[47:56.800 --> 48:00.960]  But the Emojipedia guys who I would think know what they're talking about.
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.640]  It seems as though both are accepted.
[48:02.640 --> 48:03.680]  I think it's fine.
[48:03.680 --> 48:04.080]  Yeah.
[48:04.080 --> 48:04.580]  Yeah.
[48:05.360 --> 48:06.240]  Whatever you want to do.
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.920]  Anyway, there's new, whatever, whether they are emoji or emojis, there's more of them
[48:11.920 --> 48:15.280]  in the new OS, OSs coming out.
[48:15.280 --> 48:20.000]  And I'm still, I love this backstory that it's like the, there's all, you know, like
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.800]  a long tail of people who don't like installing OS updates, but the thing that will make people
[48:24.800 --> 48:28.080]  install a new update is getting new emoji.
[48:28.080 --> 48:28.560]  Yeah.
[48:28.560 --> 48:34.000]  And that you can tell which version Apple thinks this is the one that everybody should
[48:34.000 --> 48:34.640]  update to.
[48:34.640 --> 48:39.120]  If you have a phone that's compatible with this version of iOS, this is the one you definitely
[48:39.120 --> 48:39.520]  should do.
[48:39.520 --> 48:41.520]  And that's when they put the new emojis in.
[48:41.520 --> 48:41.840]  Yeah.
[48:41.840 --> 48:44.880]  Cause nobody wants to be left behind.
[48:44.880 --> 48:46.880]  I don't use that many emoji.
[48:46.880 --> 48:49.760]  So it's not like, it's not at the top of my list.
[48:51.120 --> 48:53.520]  Although it ties into something that we were going to talk about.
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.520]  I don't know if you want to segue into that or not, but like, I have tried to use more
[48:57.520 --> 49:05.600]  emoji instead of the reactions because we have at least one friend who is on Android.
[49:06.640 --> 49:08.240]  Ah, the, the green bubble story.
[49:08.240 --> 49:09.760]  We should talk about it.
[49:09.760 --> 49:10.800]  Why not talk about it?
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.920]  Yeah, actually there's more yet.
[49:11.920 --> 49:16.240]  Cause we are in a carpool with people because Hank, we drive Hank to school, which is like
[49:16.240 --> 49:16.960]  a half an hour away.
[49:16.960 --> 49:18.640]  And so we're in a carpool with a bunch of people.
[49:18.640 --> 49:23.600]  And so that group, obviously there is a couple of people who, who have Android devices as
[49:23.600 --> 49:23.840]  well.
[49:24.880 --> 49:29.200]  And Karen will always react to things that people say on that with the Apple reactions,
[49:29.200 --> 49:31.360]  which drives me crazy because she doesn't see it.
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.080]  She doesn't see Karen liked whatever.
[49:34.080 --> 49:34.320]  Right.
[49:35.360 --> 49:36.240]  What did they say?
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.840]  I like, I guess is the thumbs up reaction or a tap back you're talking about.
[49:41.840 --> 49:43.280]  Yeah, I think that's the thumbs up thing.
[49:43.280 --> 49:43.520]  Yeah.
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.200]  And then love does the heart.
[49:45.200 --> 49:45.440]  Yeah.
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.080]  But what do they say if you give it a ha ha laugh, laughed at, I think laughed at.
[49:50.080 --> 49:50.240]  Yeah.
[49:50.960 --> 49:51.600]  Yeah.
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.000]  And, and, and what's, what's the, the exclamation marks that I don't know.
[49:56.000 --> 49:56.800]  People don't use that much.
[49:56.800 --> 50:00.240]  I use, I think I use that more than other people do, but yeah, I do too.
[50:00.240 --> 50:01.920]  I don't use the question marks.
[50:01.920 --> 50:08.160]  I've said, I said the one I would like to pay for, I would like a middle finger, which
[50:08.160 --> 50:13.760]  of course raises the point on an eggplant or, you know, that's not bad, but why are
[50:13.760 --> 50:14.320]  they separate?
[50:14.320 --> 50:16.560]  Why can't you just tap back with any emoji?
[50:17.360 --> 50:18.880]  Yeah, that'd be the way it works.
[50:18.880 --> 50:21.680]  You know, and I, that's sort of like how Slack reactions work.
[50:21.680 --> 50:28.000]  And I know that Slack has sort of a super set of emoji where you can react on Slack
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.160]  with any emoji and Slack has some custom ones.
[50:32.160 --> 50:38.880]  And for each Slack group that you're in, you can add custom images.
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.880]  I think the one that one of the ones that you and I are on together, there's like a,
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.200]  we have a play date, somebody stuck in there.
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.720]  So you can like type colon play date and get a little yellow panic play date controller.
[50:50.720 --> 50:56.080]  But even if you just stuck to emoji, why are the reactions different than just, you
[50:56.080 --> 51:00.160]  could just send any emoji you want as a reaction and it shows up as a little bubble
[51:00.160 --> 51:00.720]  on the corner.
[51:00.720 --> 51:04.240]  And I guess it's just what, how, I mean, that's how Apple's implemented it, but
[51:04.240 --> 51:06.240]  they implemented their own.
[51:07.280 --> 51:09.680]  Does it seem unhappily to implement their own?
[51:09.680 --> 51:17.440]  Remember when Safari didn't support favicons in tabs and they had the pin tabs, but
[51:17.440 --> 51:20.160]  pin tabs didn't use your favicon either.
[51:20.720 --> 51:25.600]  Apple specified that if you wanted to have an icon in your pin tab for Safari, you
[51:25.600 --> 51:30.240]  had to create a SVG file that was monochrome.
[51:30.240 --> 51:36.800]  And so you would just have a monochromatic icon that would be your pin tab thing and
[51:36.800 --> 51:41.680]  no color favicons, and then I made a stink about it on Daring Fireball and whether
[51:41.680 --> 51:46.480]  that helped change the thinking or not after I made, wrote way too many words about
[51:46.480 --> 51:51.840]  it, a new version of Safari came out with an option for favicons in tabs.
[51:51.840 --> 51:55.360]  But apparently what I heard while I was making a stink about it is that there is
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.600]  some contingent within Apple, I don't know if it was in the Safari group or the human
[51:59.600 --> 52:04.560]  interface team, but some contingent of designers who don't like, didn't like the
[52:04.560 --> 52:09.760]  idea of color icons that they didn't control, junking up the Safari interface.
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.960]  And that's why the pin tabs were, okay, we have to give you an icon because the pin
[52:14.960 --> 52:18.720]  tabs are just little, but we're going to make you do them in black and white because
[52:18.720 --> 52:22.000]  we don't want your garish CNN red in a tab.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.560]  And I just wonder if that's the thinking with tap backs, it's like, we have these
[52:26.560 --> 52:32.640]  beautiful monochromatic, just blue and white thumbs and exclamation marks, and we
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.400]  don't want your garish, any color goes emoji.
[52:36.400 --> 52:36.960]  I don't know.
[52:36.960 --> 52:37.600]  I don't know.
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.680]  That seems crazy, but because you could still send emoji, so it's almost the same
[52:41.680 --> 52:42.160]  thing.
[52:42.160 --> 52:42.800]  I don't know.
[52:42.800 --> 52:43.760]  It just seems weird.
[52:43.760 --> 52:44.400]  It's it.
[52:44.400 --> 52:44.880]  Yeah.
[52:44.880 --> 52:49.040]  It just seems like the easiest way to upgrade the tap back feature would just be,
[52:49.040 --> 52:53.120]  ah, you could just pick whatever emojis you want and set five of them as your
[52:53.120 --> 52:58.080]  favorites and have like a dot, dot, dot that would let you pick any emoji as last
[52:58.080 --> 52:58.560]  spot.
[52:58.560 --> 52:59.040]  Anyway.
[52:59.040 --> 52:59.520]  Yeah.
[53:00.160 --> 53:03.360]  Aren't they moving to the more universal standard thing?
[53:04.240 --> 53:04.800]  For what?
[53:04.800 --> 53:05.760]  I forget what it's called.
[53:05.760 --> 53:06.960]  There's like, there is a react.
[53:06.960 --> 53:10.800]  There's like a, isn't there something that you can, that Android phones can use as
[53:10.800 --> 53:11.280]  well?
[53:11.280 --> 53:12.400]  No, I don't think so.
[53:12.400 --> 53:12.960]  Oh, really?
[53:12.960 --> 53:15.840]  I thought there was, I thought there was some thing that they were like, we're
[53:15.840 --> 53:17.280]  going to try and, I don't know.
[53:17.280 --> 53:22.960]  No, what happened is that I think the Google messages app on Android will
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.400]  interpret those text messages, like for a mixed iPhone and Android group chat,
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.440]  where it'll say like, John liked, quote the message.
[53:33.440 --> 53:37.920]  They interpret, cause that just comes across as its own SMS message.
[53:37.920 --> 53:43.360]  It's just a string of texts that says, John liked space quote, and then it's a
[53:43.360 --> 53:46.000]  quote of the message the previous.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.480]  It's like turning, it's turning SMS into email where there's like underneath
[53:50.480 --> 53:51.440]  your message.
[53:51.440 --> 53:57.920]  There's every single quoted version of the previous emails in the chain, even
[53:57.920 --> 54:01.040]  though every modern email client could just show them all together.
[54:01.040 --> 54:05.440]  Now, all of a sudden with the tap backs, we're quoting messages.
[54:05.440 --> 54:11.680]  Anyway, Google's Android messages client will take those and turn them into fake
[54:11.680 --> 54:14.240]  tap backs, supposedly.
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.440]  I don't have much more to say about the green bubble, blue bubble thing.
[54:17.440 --> 54:18.400]  I wrote about it.
[54:18.400 --> 54:24.560]  I just think, I do think it's just so damn curious that no single messaging
[54:24.560 --> 54:28.240]  platform around the world has come to dominate, right?
[54:28.240 --> 54:32.880]  Like with social networks, a handful have, right?
[54:32.880 --> 54:38.400]  Twitter or to some degree, but then of course, Facebook and Instagram and China
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.800]  is weird because they have the great firewall.
[54:40.800 --> 54:42.320]  So of course they have their own.
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.080]  The fact that China has their own social networks is not surprising, but
[54:46.080 --> 54:52.240]  otherwise Facebook sort of dominates worldwide yet for messaging platforms.
[54:52.240 --> 54:54.800]  There's all these little country by country fiefdoms.
[54:54.800 --> 54:57.040]  It's that to me is the strangest part.
[54:57.040 --> 54:57.680]  Yeah.
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.840]  And that's kind of why I think that sort of bullying thing didn't really ring true
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.040]  to me because my kid, he uses messages sometimes, but I'm pretty sure they, he,
[55:07.040 --> 55:10.240]  I don't even know what it is, but Snapchat or whatever he's using to communicate
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.160]  with his friends because he won't tell me and I don't want to ask, but he's
[55:14.160 --> 55:17.840]  communicating with his friends using other stuff for sure.
[55:17.840 --> 55:20.560]  Discord is big with Jonas and his pals.
[55:20.560 --> 55:24.160]  You know, I've used discord a little I've used it enough that I get it.
[55:24.160 --> 55:27.840]  It's more like Slack though, where you get on a group, but there's like a
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.400]  channel and discord and there could be dozens and dozens of people, way more
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.960]  people than you would want in a group chat in any thing like a WhatsApp or
[55:36.960 --> 55:41.360]  iMessage, you wouldn't really want to have three dozen people in an iMessage
[55:41.360 --> 55:41.680]  group.
[55:41.680 --> 55:45.840]  Discord is more like, it's meant for groups in the public hanging out place
[55:45.840 --> 55:46.400]  online.
[55:46.400 --> 55:46.880]  Yeah.
[55:46.880 --> 55:47.600]  I don't know.
[55:47.600 --> 55:52.400]  Maybe it wasn't even worth venting about on daring fireball, but I don't know.
[55:52.400 --> 55:55.040]  I just made the, the bullying angle made me angry.
[55:55.040 --> 55:55.520]  Yeah.
[55:55.520 --> 55:57.200]  Well, and it's also in the wall street journal.
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.000]  It's not, it wasn't in the national enquirer or something.
[56:00.000 --> 56:00.480]  Yeah.
[56:00.480 --> 56:03.360]  A little bit of Paul Theron was going off on it.
[56:03.360 --> 56:06.240]  I did think it was weird that Google latched onto it.
[56:06.240 --> 56:09.680]  And I don't think the wall street journal used the word bullying at all.
[56:09.680 --> 56:15.680]  Google took their anecdotes of teenagers being given a hard time over having
[56:15.680 --> 56:19.680]  green bubbles in a group chat and turned it into use, introduced the word
[56:19.680 --> 56:20.400]  bullying.
[56:20.400 --> 56:23.440]  But then once that happened, it went everywhere.
[56:23.440 --> 56:27.440]  And then there was like a story USA today as a story about teenagers being
[56:27.440 --> 56:28.800]  bullied over green bubbles.
[56:28.800 --> 56:31.840]  And it's like, no, no, that wasn't even in the, that wasn't even in the
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.520]  wall street journal story.
[56:33.520 --> 56:34.000]  Yeah.
[56:34.000 --> 56:34.560]  Okay.
[56:34.560 --> 56:37.280]  Uh, yeah, I didn't, I, yeah, I don't subscribe.
[56:37.280 --> 56:38.320]  So yeah.
[56:38.320 --> 56:41.760]  Have you, do you, would you use any other chats?
[56:41.760 --> 56:44.000]  I use signal, which I have.
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.040]  I do have signal.
[56:45.040 --> 56:45.440]  Yeah.
[56:45.440 --> 56:48.480]  And I've used a little bit, but not much.
[56:48.480 --> 56:48.960]  Yeah.
[56:48.960 --> 56:52.720]  I have it open so that anybody, you know, who wants to send me a secure message
[56:52.720 --> 56:53.360]  can do it.
[56:53.360 --> 56:54.320]  It's worked out pretty well.
[56:54.320 --> 56:58.880]  I don't get very many messages from random, like readers or listeners through
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.880]  signal, but I don't get it.
[57:00.880 --> 57:04.320]  Signal, but I do occasionally and it's there and it's good enough.
[57:04.320 --> 57:07.520]  I'm on one group chat with a couple of friends on signal.
[57:08.160 --> 57:11.520]  I don't really see much of a difference than if we were doing it on iMessage.
[57:11.520 --> 57:15.200]  And I'm not even quite sure why we're on signal since we all have iPhones,
[57:15.200 --> 57:21.120]  but no, I know why we're, I know why my group is on signal, but it's not,
[57:21.120 --> 57:22.880]  like I said, I don't use it much.
[57:23.680 --> 57:27.520]  I've got the WhatsApp too, and I'm on one group in WhatsApp now.
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.480]  And I do see Ben Thompson, my dithering pal has been on me for a while about
[57:32.480 --> 57:37.280]  the fact that WhatsApp has better group messaging features, like quoted
[57:37.280 --> 57:38.160]  replies.
[57:38.160 --> 57:42.400]  And it is, it actually is a nicer way if you're asynchronous, you know,
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.320]  which when Ben and I chat is often the case because we're literally either
[57:46.320 --> 57:49.680]  12 or 13 hours apart all year long.
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.960]  And if you're, you know, you wake up and a bunch of the chat had taken place
[57:52.960 --> 57:56.880]  while you were sleeping and you want to reply to something nine messages ago,
[57:56.880 --> 57:58.960]  you can tap on it and hit reply.
[57:58.960 --> 58:05.600]  The way that WhatsApp does that is much more, it's a much better presentation
[58:05.600 --> 58:08.960]  than the recently added iMessage feature that does it.
[58:09.760 --> 58:13.840]  Would it make me try to convince a group that I'm on on iMessage,
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.240]  hey, everybody sign up for this new WhatsApp thing that's owned by Facebook,
[58:18.240 --> 58:19.840]  let's move it over there?
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.760]  No, but that really is, that is like the sort of mass behavior, right?
[58:25.760 --> 58:28.800]  Nobody really wants to sign up for an entirely new app.
[58:28.800 --> 58:32.400]  Even if you put the Facebook's ownership aside, if you just like Signal,
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.040]  let's say Signal is generally widely regarded as excellent cryptography.
[58:37.040 --> 58:38.000]  And it's not even a company.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.520]  I think it's a foundation, but that they're in it for the right reasons.
[58:41.520 --> 58:45.680]  They really just want to provide good, secure messaging to everybody.
[58:45.680 --> 58:49.600]  You could encourage people to try Signal without seeming like you're telling
[58:49.600 --> 58:52.160]  them to sign up for a bad company like Facebook.
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.480]  It's still, it's like, nobody wants to download a new app, create an account,
[58:56.480 --> 58:59.120]  remember to have this, get notifications from a different app,
[58:59.120 --> 59:00.880]  just to have one more group chat there.
[59:00.880 --> 59:03.840]  If everybody's already getting by with what they have,
[59:03.840 --> 59:05.360]  they're just going to keep doing it.
[59:05.360 --> 59:05.600]  Yeah.
[59:06.400 --> 59:09.840]  It's crazy how quickly Zoom took off after the pandemic though,
[59:09.840 --> 59:18.800]  because that was an instance of sort of a void of good video chat.
[59:18.800 --> 59:20.640]  That worked on all devices.
[59:20.640 --> 59:21.920]  That worked on all platforms.
[59:21.920 --> 59:27.920]  And was able to handle millions and millions of people suddenly using it.
[59:27.920 --> 59:28.240]  Yeah.
[59:28.240 --> 59:28.960]  Kudos to them.
[59:28.960 --> 59:30.160]  Right place, right time.
[59:30.160 --> 59:31.120]  You can't predict it.
[59:31.120 --> 59:31.680]  I don't even know.
[59:31.680 --> 59:36.640]  I guess I did write about Zoom before the pandemic, because there was like some
[59:36.640 --> 59:41.200]  mini brouhaha about their Mac software doing shady stuff behind the scenes,
[59:41.200 --> 59:44.720]  or the installer doing some shady stuff behind the scenes.
[59:44.720 --> 59:47.520]  But it's like, I hardly even remembered the name of the company.
[59:47.520 --> 59:49.360]  And then all of a sudden it became a verb.
[59:49.360 --> 59:55.600]  It's like one of the best known, most used utilities around the entire globe.
[59:56.560 --> 59:58.160]  All thanks to a simple pandemic.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.480]  All they had to do was resequence some bad genes.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.000]  Here, let me take one last break here and thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.080]  It's our good friends at Memberful.

[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.160]  your passion with memberships.

[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.640]  or two, maybe because of the pandemic, maybe just for natural reasons.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.520]  But you would like to grow it, maybe expand beyond advertising or whatever
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.680]  else you're already doing to monetize it and add something new.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.280]  Membership is a good way to do it.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.880]  Could just be a small part of your business.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.840]  Could be the whole business.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.280]  You can have your creative endeavor where it's membership only
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.800]  is the only way you monetize it.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.280]  Memberful has features and plans to help you do that

[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.640]  You've got one, right?
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.160]  The rebound is the rebound prime.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.840]  Rebound prime.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.800]  Oh, that's a good name.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.360]  I like that.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.280]  Rebound prime.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.800]  People can sign up for the rebound.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.000]  That's who's on.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.520]  We don't have to save it for the end of the show.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.200]  Who's on the rebound with you?
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.000]  Lex Friedman and Dan Moore.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.920]  Dan Moore, our pal Dan Moore from late of Mac world.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.800]  Lex Friedman.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800]  And Lex also late of Mac world, that's true.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.320]  Not familiar with that guy.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.720]  Dan though, I know he's a science fiction author.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.080]  That's right.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.800]  By Dan's book.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:17.920]  Yeah.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.440]  Well, he's got a new book coming out.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.320]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.680]  The Nova incident.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.200]  It's already coming out.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:23.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.640]  Pre-orders they're taking them.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.040]  What else?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.680]  What do we got here?
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.600]  Face ID with a mask is coming out in iOS 15.4.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.600]  Now that's different from what they already have.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.240]  They've already got a thing that they introduced with a watch, but now they're just straight
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.040]  up saying face ID will be able to pick you out by your like.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.800]  Which is interesting to me that they're not saving this as a, you got to buy the watch.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.240]  It seems like they could have done that.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.800]  If you want this magical feature where you can unlock your phone with a mask on, just
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.360]  get the watch.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.040]  It's it's only 200 and whatever it is for the se, but, but they're rolling out to everybody,
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.840]  which is cool.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.040]  And I mean, the only thing I wonder is if, you know, a couple of weeks from now, a bunch
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.960]  of people are going to say, well, I was able to do it.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.800]  My brother did it without, you know.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.300]  Right.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.160]  That kind of thing.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:07.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.560]  When Apple does something that could, I mean, sometimes they do stuff where you're like
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.880]  that, they just want you to buy another thing.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.920]  That's why they're doing this.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.640]  And other times you could look at it that way and people might jump to that conclusion.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.760]  But when they do something like this, where they've already got a working feature that
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.680]  requires at least a $200 Apple watch to make it work.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.000]  And now they're making it work.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.440]  They're saying, look, this is less secure because it's only like half your face.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.440]  And so I think you have to set it up while you're wearing a mask and you make the decision.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.320]  I would like Face ID only to work when it sees my whole face, which is more secure or
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:41.960]  less secure.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.040]  I'll have it work and it'll identify me by my eyes while I'm wearing a mask.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.560]  And I accept the lower level of security and I'll do it that way.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.840]  But a great feature.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.320]  Yeah.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.240]  I've mentioned this on the show before.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.480]  I've heard ever since the iPhone 10 came out, a handful of, at least a handful of readers
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.240]  who regularly correspond to me, who work as medical professionals, who have mentioned
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.360]  that Face ID sucks when you're wearing a mask.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.800]  And this is pre-pandemic.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.920]  This is people, you know, in hospitals and other doctor type situations, dentists or
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.840]  something like that, where you might be wearing a regular, I don't know if you know this,
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.320]  but people used to wear these medical masks before the pandemic.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.120]  General purpose.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.840]  Well, no, not general purpose, but specific purpose masks.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.720]  And that not having Touch ID and having Face ID, which did not work with these masks, sucked.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.920]  Yeah, I can imagine that.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.560]  And now it's like, we're all like, yeah, it really does suck.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.360]  This is terrible.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.120]  You know, even if like in some optimistic scenario, which I'm no longer, I just assume
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.600]  this pandemic is going to go on for the rest of our lives at this point.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.040]  And if it doesn't, then I'll just be happily surprised.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.840]  But I'm sick of convincing myself that we're just around the corner.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.360]  It's I'm sick of it.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:56.440]  But let's just say in the theoretical hypothetical universe where things actually get better
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:03.000]  and stay better and masking for COVID-19 no longer becomes a daily part of our life all
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.280]  around the world, it still is a good feature to have for, say, medical professionals, say,
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:17.560]  for a new variant that might arise to the next year, year after, whatever, just regular
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.280]  cold and flu season, which I think, you know, is going to be, I think one thing of COVID
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:27.400]  is going to be transformative around the world is that even in regular cold and flu season
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.360]  for decades to come, people I think are going to feel comfortable wearing a face mask when
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.800]  they go out, either because they feel like, hey, I've got a sniffle, I should do the
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.200]  right thing when I go to the store and put a mask on.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:45.080]  Or if you just want to wear one, just to avoid picking up whatever random crud people are
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.120]  sneezing into the air.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.240]  Yeah, basically the way Asian countries have been doing it for years.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.200]  Where it's just completely normal, if not typical, you know, in a bunch of Asian countries,
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:01.480]  you get on the subway in cold and flu season, everybody just puts on a mask to keep from
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.000]  catching whatever's in the air.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.520]  It's great that Face ID has it.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.640]  So 15.4 is adding this as a feature.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.440]  I look forward to it.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.080]  I'll set it up.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:11.480]  I love the watch feature.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.920]  Yeah, I would just stick, I mean, I wear the watch anyway, so I'm perfectly fine with
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.080]  that.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.400]  And it works almost all the time.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.400]  Yeah, every once in a while, for some reason, it stopped.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.840]  Like it'll just refuse to open.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.040]  I got to type in my password, but for the most part, it works pretty well.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.640]  Again, it's common sense, but you can tell which features people at Apple use the most.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.960]  And there's long running gags that things that don't really apply to non-Silicon Valley
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.520]  weather.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.200]  I mean, the best way to exaggerate it is the idea that maybe they're going to come out
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.840]  with this Apple car in a couple of years and it, you know, it doesn't work in the rain
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.560]  or ice.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:54.200]  Yeah, it works perfectly if it's 72 degrees and sunny, but you can, everybody's wearing
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.240]  masks these days.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.480]  And so I feel like you ever, even since this feature came out and it was very good for
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.040]  me, even when it was in beta, it's gotten better.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.200]  Like for a while, it would get confused and say like, Hey, is your Apple watch nearby?
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:11.480]  And meanwhile, I'm actually holding my phone in the hand that where the watch is on my
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:11.800]  wrist.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.720]  It's like, it's really close.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.240]  I didn't get a lot closer.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:21.560]  I've had fewer and fewer problems with that, but it's been, it's made face ID seem less
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.480]  poorly quenched, poorly timed.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.280]  It just seems we went all these years without a pandemic.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.760]  And then lo and behold, a year and a half or so after, after the first face ID phone,
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.280]  and we get stuck with this.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:32.600]  Yeah.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.720]  I got my first face ID phone during the pandemic.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.040]  Because I had SEs, I had SEs for years.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:40.360]  Yeah.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.240]  Perfect timing.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:41.400]  Yeah.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.520]  I was like, well, that was dumb.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.240]  Let me see here.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.640]  What else?
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.920]  What is the other features?
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.760]  There there's like an Apple card widget.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.560]  Who cares?
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:47.960]  I don't know.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.160]  There's not that many features.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.920]  It's a midway through the cycle.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.880]  That seems about it.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:55.160]  Last thing I had on my list, I was, you want to talk about Neil Young and Spotify?
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:55.880]  Yeah, sure.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.200]  Ben Thompson and I, I know you probably didn't listen to it.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.840]  I think it just came out this morning, but we disagree about this.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.600]  Ben on dithering last night.
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:07.400]  I say last night, but it came out this morning, but seems to have a free speech sort of argument
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.600]  that, Hey, we shouldn't be trying.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.680]  Maybe you disagree with what Joe Rogan says, but you shouldn't try to get him kicked off,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.040]  have his podcast shut down.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.080]  We'd need more speech.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.640]  The answer to speech is always more speech, blah, blah, blah.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.600]  I was a little taken.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.040]  And I think because of what I wrote about it, he seemed to think that I was thinking
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.320]  that Spotify should kick Joe Rogan off Spotify, which was not my take at all.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.840]  Spotify made their bed with him.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.200]  They signed a hundred million dollar deal.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.080]  Clearly when Neil Young issued this ultimatum, he did.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.200]  He's a very smart guy.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.240]  He did not think Spotify was going to kick Joe Rogan off.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.080]  He said, look, you can have Joe Rogan or Neil Young, but you can't have both.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.800]  He did issue an ultimatum, but he knew what they were going to do.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.200]  Right.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.160]  I don't think, yeah.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.560]  I don't think anybody thought anything other than what was, what happened was going to
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:51.960]  happen.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:57.160]  But I think, see, to me, that is free speech too, right?
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:58.680]  Right?
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.080]  Yeah.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.840]  It, it, and it's, he played, he got a lot of publicity for it.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.760]  And if you go, if you go into a bar and you sit down and you're like, you're sitting there
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.880]  having a drink and you look around and you're like, man, there are a lot of Nazis in here.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.960]  You don't have to keep going back to that bar.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.920]  And you talked to the bar generally, like, can you kick these Nazis out?
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.880]  And they're the guys like, well, hey, so I'm not going to kick them out.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.720]  Well, I'm not going back to a Nazi bar.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.040]  It's part, I'm not saying Joe Rogan is a Nazi.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.320]  I'm just saying he's an idiot.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.840]  But it's, you know, it's a good point where you could say, hey, what's with all these
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.240]  guys with the swastika tattoos on their knuckles.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.560]  And, and if the answer is, ah, it's a free country, part of it being a free country is
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.240]  you can go to a different bar.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.360]  You know, that's exactly.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.760]  And yeah, I mean, and, and I, you know, he said 60% of his
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.920]  60% of the money that he gets from his songs comes from Spotify, I think 60% of the plays
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.400]  or something.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.400]  60% of the streaming revenue.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:53.880]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.280]  Right.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.080]  So that, and for an artist like Neil Young, who's slightly older.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.400]  Yeah.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.560]  And it was probably not the bulk of his income.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.040]  There's probably still a lot of his audience still buys music, but on the other hand too,
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.880]  when you're in your seventies, they're using, they're, he gets it mostly from car
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.520]  commercials.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.960]  You can also assume that most of your fans already own most of your music, you know,
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.200]  especially the older stuff, which is what people like.
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.840]  So it's, you know, you may not make a lot of money as an classic artist for lack of
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:28.600]  a better term from your music sales, but it's, he's putting his money where his mouth
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:28.920]  is.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.160]  Right.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.840]  And it was, if it's, you know, 60% of it was Spotify.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:38.040]  And I guess the rest comes from like Amazon and Apple, but the publicity, they came out
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:38.520]  over it.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:45.400]  And the fact that it's inspired some number of people to say, Hey, yeah, this isn't right.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.720]  I don't know why Spotify is associating themselves with Joe Rogan.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:56.120]  I'm going to cancel my, my Spotify, or I want Spotify to cancel Joe Rogan's podcast.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.880]  That's the argument you get to have.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.440]  It was Spotify's decision to sign Joe Rogan.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:06.040]  And like I said to Ben, you know, I don't think any of this has been a surprise.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:12.920]  I don't think that his takes on, his hot takes on vaccines and ivermectin and whatever
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:13.160]  else.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.640]  And I don't think Joe Rogan's podcast does not interest me, but it doesn't offend me.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.000]  It's, I don't think it's anywhere close to the lunatic fringe of stuff that's out there.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:29.320]  You know, and if people want to talk about taking these alternate things, have at it.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.120]  If you take what Joe Rogan says seriously, I don't know.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.320]  I don't think that him stopping his podcast or somebody booting his podcast off Spotify
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.440]  is really going to help you much.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:40.760]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.800]  I don't think your next source of information, like if Joe, Joe Rogan comes out with an
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.560]  episode today and says, you know what?
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.240]  I listened to Neil Young's argument.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.600]  I respect him so much.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.800]  I'm just going to take a break.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.600]  I'm going to take a break.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.280]  I'm not doing an episode for six months.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.640]  I'm going to take a break and think about what I've done with my life and that's it.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.800]  He's going to take a six month hiatus.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.840]  I don't think the people who were getting their medical information from the Joe Rogan
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.240]  experience, their next choice is not going to be that much better.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.400]  They're not going to like the New England journal of medicine.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.200]  Yeah.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.320]  And I guess I called him an idiot and maybe that's the wrong term to use.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.520]  It's more like an asshole because he could just be making a financial decision.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:29.400]  It could be, could just be deciding smartly to say, yeah, I'm providing misinformation,
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.240]  but I'm also making a lot of money doing it.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.120]  And it's Spotify signed him.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.720]  It's not, it is different.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.960]  Neil Young is saying, is telling his fans, you want to stream my music, go to Apple Music
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.600]  or go to Amazon, or there's the list of other services, but those are for at least people
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.880]  in North America.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.760]  Those are the big ones.
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:54.200]  And, why isn't Neil Young complaining that Apple podcasts, if you search for Joe Rogan
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.160]  would turn up, I guess his new show, it's a Spotify exclusive, but it'll turn up, would
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.920]  have turned it up while Joe Rogan's podcast was a regular podcast, would turn up Joe Rogan
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.000]  similar podcasts.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.120]  And why isn't he objecting to that?
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.800]  That's because it's like, Apple podcasts is like a web browser where it just pretty
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:24.520]  much, and yes, iTunes runs their own index of known podcasts for search and controversially,
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.640]  I guess, to some degree, does take some out that have outright hate content.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.240]  What's the Alex Jones thing called Info Wars was delisted from iTunes for being beyond
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:41.000]  the pale, which, you know, some people object to, people who say, yeah, Alex Jones is a
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.760]  bad, horrible person and an idiot, and his show is terrible, but it shouldn't be delisted
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.120]  from a podcast index.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.760]  You know, there's some people whose free speech fundamentalism is that deep, but there's
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.280]  gotta be a line somewhere, right?
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:14:00.920]  I mean, Apple's not going to put their, it's not a stamp of approval to be listed in Apple
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.560]  podcasts.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.880]  It's, they're not paying you, which is the big difference.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.280]  Can't be.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.040]  They list both of our podcasts.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.520]  The flip side of this is people who don't want Spotify to cave and think that Neil
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:20.200]  Young is doing Joe Rogan dirty by trying to pressure them to cancel his show are missing
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.800]  the fact that that's what Spotify signed up for by signing Joe Rogan.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.120]  Yeah.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.960]  You decided what your platform was going to be.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:32.920]  You know, and I could imagine somebody else, you know, might look at any network and I
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.000]  like, I'm not of the sensitive, I don't like listening.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.560]  I can't stand to listen to somebody who I disagree with.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:47.320]  I try to read, you know, some level of rational, conservative thought and politics and watch
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.520]  shows like the Bill Maher show where he has guests who, you know, I often think, wow,
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.520]  that person's an idiot or Bill Maher often says things and I think, wow, Bill Maher is
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.880]  being a bit of an idiot here, but that doesn't make me like, I can't stand hearing somebody
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.320]  say something I disagree with.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.720]  I'll at least listen to it and I might, it may not change my mind, but it's not like
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.320]  sunshine to a vampire to me to be exposed to somebody who I disagree with, but I can
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.080]  also see how somebody who's controversial enough on a certain network or a provider
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:25.800]  like Spotify might make me say, well, that person is so beyond the pale that I don't
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.560]  want to be associated with this group.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.600]  Yeah, this is, we're talking about stuff that is just simply objectively incorrect
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:41.160]  as well. That's become such a problem, such a ridiculous problem that we, that it's not
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.840]  a matter of opinion anymore.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.480]  I mean, you can have an opinion, you can definitely have an opinion about the effectiveness of
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.680]  masks or something like that, but like whether or not a vaccine works or whether vaccines
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.720]  are killing people.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:01.240]  Right, or the John Stockton take, NBA, NBA great John Stockton, who believes 150% of
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.160]  professional athletes around the world, not just have died of the vaccine, have dropped
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.840]  dead on the field or court, and it's all being covered up.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:17.000]  Yeah, it's, well, I don't know, you know, and the other thing too about Neil Young that
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.880]  I was thinking about, I think last night, but I was thinking about it is there is something
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:28.600]  to be said for an artist who has spent literally his entire career, whether you like his music
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:34.280]  or dislike his music or feel ambivalent or just like it when he's with the Crosby Stills
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:40.600]  and Nash or something, everybody I know has the utmost respect for his integrity, right?
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.040]  He's, or you could certainly disagree with his stance on like no compression music and
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:52.200]  that goofy Panos player he was trying to sell, but he wasn't trying to make a quick buck.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.120]  He was coming at it from a perspective of genuine integrity.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.920]  That's the thing. I mean, yeah. And in this instance, he's not going to make money off
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:05.880]  of this, right? And there's no, I don't think, like you could say, well, he's just pandering
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.880]  to certain people. And I think the fact that he's giving up 60% of his streaming revenue
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.200]  is kind of a sign that that's not going to work out very well for him if that's his plan,
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.160]  which I don't think it is.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.520]  And it's not like he's selling Neil Young's COVID protection vitamins. It's not like there's
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.640]  some kind of scam back there.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.920]  Right. There's some sort of alternative. Yeah. Don't use ivermectin. That stuff doesn't work.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.320]  But what does work is Neil Young's protective vitamins.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.720]  Right. And, and eye drops or something.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.840]  It does work as listening to uncompressed music.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:41.080]  Yes. Yes. That keeps the COVID right out of your nasal passage.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:48.120]  What lets those damn COVID, those little COVID bits get in there is
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.400]  MPEG-3 compression. It slips through the gaps in the ones and zeros.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.680]  No, I was trying to remember it because I knew he had said some stuff that was like eye rolling
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.160]  and I didn't, and I couldn't remember exactly what it was. And so I had to lick it up when
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.360]  this came up. I was like, Oh yeah, that's right. It was audio stuff.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.640]  It's funny too, because a lot of the, I don't know about him in particular, but a lot of
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:19.240]  the artists of his generation have serious hearing problems. I mean, Pete Townsend famously,
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.240]  because they just didn't know back then and they, you know, play their music loud and they didn't
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:29.640]  have all of the earplugs and the, those, you know, it's not just like plugging up your ears
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.520]  so you don't go deaf from the loud music, but also that now they have the little wireless
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.280]  things so they can, the artists can hear the feedback so they can tell they're playing the
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.840]  music. But I forget, Amy was telling me it was very funny, but I think it was Billy Eilish and
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:48.360]  her brother met Elton John and they're, somebody was on, you know, on like a talk show talking
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.880]  about it. And they were like, he can't hear anything you have Adam. And it's like, who knew?
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.440]  You know, but like, you know, a lot of the people who, you know, the artists who came up in the
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:02.360]  sixties and seventies, they have some hearing problems. So Neil Young seems to think he can
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.680]  hear the difference between high quality MPEG threes and uncompressed audio. Who knows? Maybe
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.760]  he can. I don't know. He's certainly if anybody could, maybe it's him. Maybe he just feels it.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.560]  Yeah. Well, that's it for me. You got anything else? Do you understand this? I don't understand
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.720]  this thing with Dropbox. Yeah. We should talk about the Dropbox thing. I forgot about that.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.280]  Yeah. I guess I don't, what I don't understand is what is actually being changed. Like some
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:36.600]  underlying Apple thing is changing so that Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive OneDrive will no longer be
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:44.280]  able to sync in the way that they used to or no. Explain it to a dumb person. Who's me.
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:52.600]  All right. So I think it's the fact that they both use kernel extensions to implement some of the
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:20:00.120]  file system stuff that they do. And kernel extensions in general are dangerous and a
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:06.680]  source of system instability because a bug in a kernel extension could cause the whole system to
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:13.400]  shut down and are a security problem for the same reasons. And so Apple, even if you want to say
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:21.320]  that Apple is being too protective with the Mac and the whole general argument of turning the Mac
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:26.840]  into more like iOS, steering third-party developers away from kernel extensions is at the
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.920]  far end of that. It's probably a good idea. And I think it was, I'm pretty sure it was macOS Catalina
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:42.200]  10.15 and they announced it at WWDC 2019 that they have these file provider extension APIs that
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:50.120]  started on iOS, which is how third-party things like Dropbox, or like you could like connect like
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:56.280]  your web server with SFTP and have them show up in the files app. They're called like file
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:02.360]  provider extensions. They were going to bring those APIs or a version of them to the Mac
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:09.560]  for similar services. And that way, instead of running in the kernel space, meaning system level,
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:17.560]  they'll run in user space. So it's just like running a regular app as a user, more secure,
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:27.080]  more forward thinking. And I think that this is where it's, there's only a handful of providers
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:31.320]  like this, you know, right. And Dropbox and Microsoft are the two who seem to be affected
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:39.880]  by this cutoff, but effectively in 12.3, which is now in beta, macOS 12.3, those kernel extension
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:46.360]  APIs that they're using are not going to be there anymore. So that there are kernel extensions that
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:53.320]  currently are in use will not work. It seems like a weird thing to come in a 0.3 update, like why
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:59.720]  didn't it come in 0.0? But I'm under the impression somewhat informed that it was supposed to happen
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:05.640]  with 12.0. And because Dropbox and Microsoft weren't ready, Apple was like, okay, they pushed
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:13.000]  it back. But it was like two years warning back in 2019. And it's now is when it's coming due.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:19.480]  Microsoft has a thing in beta that has all their functionality. Dropbox, I think looks like it's
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.640]  going to be at least till summer. Dropbox is, whatever complaints people have about Dropbox
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.600]  on the Mac, it's gotten worse because they only came out with an Apple Silicon native version
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:34.360]  a couple of weeks ago. I mean, and that's over a year, right? I mean, and it's funny because
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:38.200]  I still use it. I used it throughout the whole period and Dropbox, I didn't really notice that
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:44.760]  Dropbox was any worse while it was running as an Intel compiled binary. But it was weird. And every
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.400]  once in a while, I'd go to activity monitor and you can turn on, there's like a column. You can
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.960]  have all your processes listed and see which ones are Apple Silicon and which ones are Intel.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:23:00.200]  And the only ones I had running were Dropbox's stuff. That's it. It just seems like it's like
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:06.680]  this weird thing where running Intel binaries on Apple Silicon Macs, they run so fast, they're
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:12.520]  actually faster than most Intel Macs running the same things. That's how good Rosetta 2 is.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:19.560]  But at the same time, it seems like almost all the software I use was updated to be native for
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.000]  Apple Silicon so quickly that it didn't matter. Like even if the running the Intel stuff was
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.280]  really slow, it wouldn't have really kept me from being a proponent of the Apple Silicon Macs
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.680]  because so little of it was there. But it's just to me a sign that Dropbox's commitment
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:43.880]  to the Mac or just their competence developing the Mac stuff is not entirely there. And so
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:49.480]  they're the laggard who's... And again, it doesn't seem like Dropbox entirely won't work on 12.3.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:54.920]  What's not going to work is... I forget what they call it. It's like selective sync where you can
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:01.880]  have four gigabytes of stuff in your Dropbox account, but you could say, I only want this
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:07.400]  subset of my folders in my Dropbox to actually sync to my Mac and just leave the other stuff
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:14.840]  as like downloaded only if I need it and tell Dropbox, okay, now I want to download this big
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.640]  movie that I had sitting there. But previously, it was just like a stub. But they've had...
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:26.920]  The thing that to me is the key is it's not like Apple just announced... And Dropbox's help file
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:32.840]  makes it seem like they just found out about this last week. You know, like, oh my God, we just saw
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:37.720]  this 12.3 beta. It's going to break a bunch of stuff. We're working really hard on it. This stuff
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:46.840]  was all announced at WWDC 2019. And the fact that the... Hey, Apple, of course, publicly emphasizes
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.640]  we've got these great new file provider APIs that are safer and more secure and more forward
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.040]  thinking. They don't emphasize the, and we're going to take away the old thing because that
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.080]  doesn't sound like fun, but it's implied that they're going to take away the old thing at some
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.200]  point. And I think it's safe to assume that Dropbox and Microsoft are high enough up that
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:13.720]  Apple's developer relations have let them know. It was not as... And the big tell is that Box,
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.600]  which is another competitor in that exact same space, they announced full support for the new
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:25.240]  stuff in October, so like months ago. Like Box is ready to go and has no missing features. And
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.880]  when 12.3 comes out, people who are using Box don't have to know any of this and it'll all
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:34.120]  just work. You know, Microsoft, I think, will probably... It's going to be very close to maybe
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:39.320]  when in March Mac OS 12.3 actually ships to consumers. They're probably going to come in
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.200]  right under the gun. Dropbox, I think, based on their communications, is going to be late,
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.960]  but they shouldn't have been. That's the key. And so I think...
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:53.800]  Well, I mean, you can argue certainly, and I think there is some merit to the argument that
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.880]  they're not making as much of an effort because Apple has basically decided that they're going
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.600]  to move into the things that Dropbox does. Apple is deciding that they're going to try
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:08.760]  and make it easier for people to do the simple things that people used to use Dropbox for.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.480]  And so Dropbox does not care about Mac clients or Mac users that much anymore.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.400]  I guess, but I don't know. Box does, obviously, or they care enough that they did the right thing.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:25.400]  I mean, and that was the speculation. A friend of the show, Stephen Hackett, had a post that I
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:30.120]  thought was a little surprising where he just spitballed the idea of, hey, maybe Apple is
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:37.080]  pulling a rug out on Dropbox and OneDrive because they've got iCloud Drive that has similar features
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.760]  and doesn't have a problem in Mac OS 12.3 with files that are only in the cloud.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.320]  And again, I think it speaks that the idea would even pop into Stephen Hackett's head.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:55.320]  To me, speaks to the growing resentment and skeptical eye that even long-time Apple users
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.800]  look at the company now. Like if there's any angle where maybe they're trying to get people
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:06.360]  to sign up for Apple services or upgrade to a higher tier of services, that idea pops into
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:10.280]  our heads in a way that didn't five years ago, maybe.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:15.000]  Yeah. It doesn't seem like, again, when we talk about the things that are a rounding error for
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.960]  Apple, it just seems how many more people are they going to get to sign up for higher storage
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.040]  tiers of iCloud? Maybe. I guess it's possible. It seems more likely that they're going to get
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.960]  people who are just going to sign up for the Apple One, the whole kit and caboodle thing.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:37.400]  And that is what they're eyeing for everything and every little thing. No one thing is going
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.240]  to tip people over, but it's all this stuff together that's going to say, that's going
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.680]  to make it, you know, and that's what it's done with me certainly is why not get that
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.760]  thing? It's 25 bucks a month or wherever it is in 29. I don't remember, but it's like,
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.880]  it's got enough in there that it makes sense. Tim Cook is listening and he's thinking, yes,
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.560]  that's exactly it. You don't even remember.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.080]  I don't even remember. Perfect.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.360]  Steepling his fingers. Excellent.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.080]  Perfect. And now he's got a little dial there on his desk and he's, you know, he's turning it up.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.160]  Ah, $29 a month, $35 a month.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.240]  My mom said $29 a month. He doesn't even notice.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.600]  No, because it's under 30.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.680]  I would say the other thing though to think about is the fact that for people like me who
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:27.400]  like to complain now about Dropbox, even though previously having been fans of the service,
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:34.200]  it falls under the same thing that people have been complaining about now with the direction
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.600]  one password is taking their company and the product where they're moving to the enterprise
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.640]  and Dropbox raised billions and billions of dollars and to make that money, they're not
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:53.320]  selling $10 a month plans to individuals or families. It's business and the enterprise.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:29:01.560]  And iCloud isn't in that space, right? iCloud Drive from my perspective and your perspective
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.160]  competes with Dropbox, right? You can like, oh, should I put the, I have both. I've got
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.680]  iCloud Drive and I've got Dropbox. Where should I put it? Which one should I pay? Should I maybe
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.760]  cancel my Dropbox and just try to go all in on iCloud Drive? That's not Dropbox's business,
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:22.520]  right? It certainly isn't where it was originally maybe where it was sort of like an enthusiast tool,
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:30.040]  but now it's an enterprise thing. And so, you know, Apple, even if some contingent at Apple
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.160]  really wants to get as many people to pay for more iCloud Drive storage as possible,
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.840]  that's the number one priority across all of Apple, even in that scenario, which I think
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:46.680]  would be a really foolish way for Apple to try to raise their revenue for the next year. But even if
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:53.320]  it was their number one thing, I don't think it would make them any less interested in fully
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:30:02.040]  supporting Dropbox and OneDrive with their modern APIs, right? Like it's not about trying to get
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:08.040]  people to switch to iCloud Drive. It is, we want to get these things out of the kernel,
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:13.160]  out of the kernel. We don't want Microsoft's and certainly not Dropbox running kernel extensions
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:19.720]  anymore. I will say, I think Apple is also famous for having it both ways though, too. They often
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.960]  try to err on the side of like, well, this will make a better experience and also we can cherish
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:31.960]  more friends. Well, and the other thing, too, is they are famous too, maybe infamous for, yeah,
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.680]  maybe that's a better word, but they don't necessarily dog food the same thing where
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.960]  they could say, we've got these great new APIs for Dropbox and OneDrive, and they're not the
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:47.640]  APIs that iCloud Drive is using because iCloud Drive is blessed and is part of the system.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.320]  But I really do think that for the Mac in particular, Apple wants it to be a good
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.000]  corporate citizen. They know that it's a big part of the Mac's success is that the Mac is
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.240]  like in a staff, you know, it's no longer, if you work in the enterprise, you have to use Windows.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:04.760]  The Mac is a big part of that. And using services like Box and OneDrive and Dropbox and et cetera
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.560]  is a big part of that. All right. I'm glad you remembered that. Glad to have you.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.840]  Yeah. I wanted it explained to me because I didn't quite get it.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:15.560]  Yeah. So we shall see. My thanks to our sponsors. Who do we have? We had Memberful,
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:21.880]  where you can sign up to monetize your passion with membership. We had Linode, the web hosting,
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:25.560]  and oh, man, that's where I host Staring Fireball. That's all you need to know.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.760]  And last but not least, Mack Weldon. Oh, my God, how could I forget Mack Weldon? That's,
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.920]  like I said, I've got like- Wearing it right now, yeah.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:36.040]  Wearing it right now, including my lucky pair of Mack Weldon underpants.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.520]  You're one pair of Mack Weldon underpants.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.000]  Everybody who enjoys their molts, you could get more molts on the Rebound Podcast. That's,
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.280]  what's the address for that? Why am I supposed to know? I believe

[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.400]  molts rebound, it'll take you right there. Oh, you can definitely find it there, yeah.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:02.040]  And you got the Biff with the superhero show with the last week's guest.
