[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  You ever have that thing, I sent you that link
[00:02.320 --> 00:05.200]  to the Tom Hanks story, or the Tom Hanks movie
[00:05.200 --> 00:08.060]  being on Apple TV Plus, and about three minutes
[00:08.060 --> 00:10.080]  after I sent it to you, my computer sounded
[00:10.080 --> 00:12.360]  like a freaking jet engine was taking off.
[00:12.360 --> 00:13.360]  It's so annoying.
[00:13.360 --> 00:15.840]  You have these webpages that, it's always,
[00:15.840 --> 00:16.840]  and it's like whack-a-mole.
[00:16.840 --> 00:19.000]  Like most webpages are fine, and then when it comes along,
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.840]  your computer just blows up.
[00:20.840 --> 00:24.820]  It's not even browser specific.
[00:24.820 --> 00:27.040]  It's, I got my Safari, we could talk about it,
[00:27.040 --> 00:29.800]  but I mean, you know, I'm a Safari diehard.
[00:29.800 --> 00:31.160]  I really like Safari.
[00:31.160 --> 00:34.000]  I prefer it for a number of reasons,
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.800]  but even in that regard, and even running
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.480]  like the content blocker, which I've sort of
[00:42.480 --> 00:44.480]  switched between, which I think blocks
[00:44.480 --> 00:46.000]  a lot of the most obnoxious ads,
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.600]  and I kind of like to keep mine.
[00:47.600 --> 00:48.800]  I don't want to block all ads.
[00:48.800 --> 00:50.120]  I'm not like a diehard on it.
[00:50.120 --> 00:52.860]  I'd be a hypocrite if I were in some ways,
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.980]  but even with that, every once in a while,
[00:55.980 --> 00:58.700]  my fans are roaring, and I look,
[00:58.700 --> 01:01.840]  and I can tell it's Safari from Activity Monitor,
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.400]  but Activity Monitor won't tell you which tab in Safari,
[01:06.360 --> 01:08.800]  and I can just, and I have Safari set
[01:08.800 --> 01:11.240]  so that if I quit and relaunch,
[01:11.240 --> 01:13.640]  it opens all the tabs I already had open,
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.960]  and I can quit and relaunch, and it'll go
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.560]  from 100% CPU usage to whatever normal is,
[01:20.560 --> 01:22.640]  even with dozens and dozens of tabs open,
[01:22.640 --> 01:25.480]  and there's no way to tell what the hell it was that did it.
[01:25.480 --> 01:27.740]  Sometimes it's pretty clear, though.
[01:27.740 --> 01:31.940]  That article, that page was definitely the culprit.
[01:31.940 --> 01:34.180]  What was it, Deadline Hollywood, I think?
[01:34.180 --> 01:35.580]  Yeah, something like that.
[01:36.780 --> 01:38.420]  Yeah, sometimes you can just kind of take a look
[01:38.420 --> 01:41.860]  at a page and just sort of get a sense
[01:41.860 --> 01:44.320]  that this is not gonna be good for my browser.
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.180]  Did you see that there's so much news.
[01:47.180 --> 01:50.460]  We were talking about it on, what's the other show called?
[01:51.420 --> 01:52.260]  Dithering.
[01:52.260 --> 01:53.580]  Dithering, that's it.
[01:53.580 --> 01:54.900]  We were talking about it on Dithering
[01:54.900 --> 01:58.140]  that we've been inundated, bombarded with news,
[01:58.140 --> 01:59.460]  to the point where I don't even remember
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.760]  the name of the other show,
[02:02.060 --> 02:04.020]  but one of the other bits of news this week
[02:04.020 --> 02:06.660]  was that the Chrome team announced
[02:06.660 --> 02:11.060]  that they're gonna start process reaping obnoxious ad tech.
[02:14.860 --> 02:18.420]  And it's an interesting dilemma for them.
[02:18.420 --> 02:21.380]  Right, they're gonna process reap their competitors
[02:21.380 --> 02:23.100]  is basically another way to put it.
[02:23.100 --> 02:25.620]  Yeah, because basically it's like,
[02:25.620 --> 02:27.040]  and they've made some definitions
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.740]  and I think that by anybody's reasonable perspective,
[02:36.700 --> 02:40.180]  they're erring on the side of reaping too few ads.
[02:40.180 --> 02:43.360]  I think that there are ads that would go within
[02:43.360 --> 02:45.460]  their limits for how much,
[02:45.460 --> 02:47.940]  I think they're talking about like CPU usage
[02:47.940 --> 02:49.380]  and overall download.
[02:51.260 --> 02:53.000]  There are apps that fit within their limits
[02:53.000 --> 02:53.840]  that I think it's like,
[02:53.840 --> 02:55.140]  well, why in the world would you need it?
[02:55.140 --> 02:57.660]  Would a single ad need three megabytes
[02:57.660 --> 03:01.140]  before it even starts playing video or something like that?
[03:01.140 --> 03:05.220]  That's a lot in the process, CPU stuff.
[03:05.220 --> 03:07.620]  But basically the cynical take is,
[03:07.620 --> 03:10.620]  which ads qualify the ones that aren't served by Google?
[03:11.740 --> 03:13.080]  Right.
[03:13.080 --> 03:18.080]  Well, it's one of those things where in theoretical world,
[03:19.580 --> 03:21.900]  it's extremely problematic.
[03:21.900 --> 03:26.900]  In real life world where I have this very big computer
[03:27.220 --> 03:30.420]  who that should have very capable
[03:30.420 --> 03:31.820]  and takes off like a jet engine
[03:31.820 --> 03:34.540]  because I loaded a webpage, it's definitely necessary.
[03:34.540 --> 03:39.060]  So it kind of goes, kind of stuck in the middle there.
[03:39.060 --> 03:41.900]  They're calling them resource heavy ads.
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.220]  I don't know if I quote, I'm looking at my own posts here.
[03:45.220 --> 03:46.740]  I guess I didn't quote their limits,
[03:46.740 --> 03:51.740]  but anyway, I hope Safari and WebKit get involved in this.
[03:51.900 --> 03:54.720]  I would love to see one of the changes to WebKit on the Mac
[03:54.720 --> 03:58.900]  be some kind of way to more accurately
[03:58.900 --> 04:02.300]  pinpoint obnoxious web pages so that you could see it.
[04:02.300 --> 04:05.600]  And I also feel that WebKit should be more aggressive
[04:05.600 --> 04:08.620]  about severely limiting
[04:10.380 --> 04:12.860]  the resource consumption of background tabs.
[04:12.860 --> 04:16.540]  If it's not the front most tab in the front most window,
[04:16.540 --> 04:21.140]  it really should not just, just should be by,
[04:21.140 --> 04:23.460]  it should be enforced that it could only use
[04:23.460 --> 04:25.800]  a minimal amount of CPU in the background.
[04:27.220 --> 04:28.340]  Yeah, it's interesting
[04:28.340 --> 04:30.780]  because that also gets in sort of this fuzzy space
[04:30.780 --> 04:32.500]  where in real world application,
[04:32.500 --> 04:33.980]  yes, that's definitely necessary
[04:33.980 --> 04:35.540]  because you have to go hunting for a tab.
[04:35.540 --> 04:40.500]  And I think you and I are both sort of tab hoarders.
[04:41.700 --> 04:44.760]  I actually only have 44 right now, which is shockingly low,
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.740]  but it's 44 because I just had to find the growth tab
[04:48.740 --> 04:50.540]  that was spitting up my computer again.
[04:50.540 --> 04:52.780]  That's what prompted this discussion.
[04:52.780 --> 04:54.220]  So I just killed a whole bunch of them.
[04:54.220 --> 04:56.700]  It was definitely well over a hundred before.
[04:56.700 --> 04:59.060]  So on one hand, yes, it's necessary.
[04:59.060 --> 05:01.480]  On the other hand, it gets back into the whole like,
[05:01.480 --> 05:02.960]  well, that's kind of like what iOS does.
[05:02.960 --> 05:06.620]  iOS is very strict on sort of background processes.
[05:06.620 --> 05:09.340]  And I don't know the specifics of Safari on iOS,
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.580]  but I would imagine it's the same thing
[05:10.580 --> 05:15.060]  that background tabs in Safari and iOS are basically dead,
[05:15.060 --> 05:18.620]  I would guess, but that gets into the whole like,
[05:18.620 --> 05:20.860]  well, that's great for iOS,
[05:20.860 --> 05:22.680]  but that's all the stuff I don't want on the Mac.
[05:22.680 --> 05:24.540]  I want full background processing.
[05:24.540 --> 05:26.060]  I want to be able to do all this sorts of stuff.
[05:26.060 --> 05:28.860]  So if it was an option, I think that would be better.
[05:28.860 --> 05:31.060]  Like, and honestly, that's the solution, I think,
[05:31.060 --> 05:35.680]  for a lot of these tensions is there needs to be more options
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.980]  and less sort of this way or the highway
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.280]  on the Mac specifically,
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.380]  because you've got to, you know it's the old,
[05:42.380 --> 05:44.220]  I recite this article every time I come on the podcast.
[05:44.220 --> 05:47.100]  You're old, the Mac lets the iOS be what it is
[05:47.100 --> 05:48.720]  because the Mac can do everything, right?
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.220]  And you start walking on the Mac, it's like,
[05:50.220 --> 05:53.500]  well, what's the release valve?
[05:53.500 --> 05:54.340]  What's the pressure valve here?
[05:54.340 --> 05:56.820]  That was the worst, that was the worst paraphrasing
[05:56.820 --> 05:58.340]  of that you've ever done.
[05:58.340 --> 06:00.420]  And you have brought it up every time.
[06:01.660 --> 06:03.340]  And I usually have the worst memory,
[06:03.340 --> 06:06.020]  but because it was a good line that I wrote a long time ago,
[06:06.020 --> 06:07.060]  I have it more or less.
[06:07.060 --> 06:08.780]  I forget if I called it iOS or not,
[06:08.780 --> 06:12.020]  but I think my paraphrasing of the phrase was,
[06:12.020 --> 06:14.700]  it would be the heaviness of the Mac
[06:14.700 --> 06:18.780]  is what allows the iPhone to remain light,
[06:18.780 --> 06:20.660]  but maybe it was iOS to remain light.
[06:20.660 --> 06:22.060]  I forget, I might've even written it
[06:22.060 --> 06:25.180]  when the iPad wasn't even out yet.
[06:25.180 --> 06:27.920]  I think it was probably more like 2012 or so.
[06:28.940 --> 06:30.860]  But yeah, I still think that that holds true.
[06:30.860 --> 06:33.240]  And I still think that that's an interesting,
[06:33.240 --> 06:35.540]  it certainly I think is true inside Apple
[06:35.540 --> 06:39.800]  in terms of the whole ongoing debate of,
[06:42.260 --> 06:44.660]  it's the iPad that's in dispute, right?
[06:44.660 --> 06:48.040]  Like nobody's really arguing that the iPhone
[06:48.040 --> 06:51.380]  needs to do more stuff that the Mac does
[06:51.380 --> 06:55.160]  or that the Mac needs to be more like the iPhone, right?
[06:55.160 --> 06:57.900]  It's the iPad in the middle that is sort of,
[06:57.900 --> 07:00.980]  hey, this is better than that, this is good for work,
[07:00.980 --> 07:02.940]  you can't do work, all these debates,
[07:02.940 --> 07:07.940]  it's all about the iPad, but it still is.
[07:08.100 --> 07:09.660]  My first thought though, I don't really care about the iPad
[07:09.660 --> 07:12.620]  just to make sure, I mean, I care to a degree,
[07:12.620 --> 07:16.020]  but just make sure the Mac can keep doing everything
[07:16.020 --> 07:17.820]  that it can do already.
[07:17.820 --> 07:18.820]  But it is still true,
[07:18.820 --> 07:20.700]  even though it's not in dispute about the iPhone,
[07:20.700 --> 07:22.080]  the heaviness of the Mac,
[07:22.080 --> 07:24.320]  and like one of the things that's heavy on the Mac
[07:24.320 --> 07:27.740]  is that it has this whole Unix layer
[07:27.740 --> 07:29.820]  where you can just run old,
[07:29.820 --> 07:34.380]  now I say old, but I realized, I'm sure, 100% sure
[07:34.380 --> 07:37.100]  that there are dozens of people listening to me
[07:37.100 --> 07:41.060]  and you talk right now in May 2020 on this show
[07:41.060 --> 07:45.780]  who today edited shell scripts on their Mac.
[07:46.900 --> 07:48.980]  So I say old only in terms of the fact
[07:48.980 --> 07:51.520]  that writing Unix style shell scripts
[07:53.060 --> 07:54.460]  is a longstanding thing,
[07:54.460 --> 07:56.120]  not that it's outdated or irrelevant,
[07:56.120 --> 08:01.120]  but it's a big part of the build script phase of Xcode
[08:02.360 --> 08:04.060]  where you can do custom things
[08:04.060 --> 08:06.740]  and when you build and run your app in Xcode,
[08:06.740 --> 08:08.500]  it can call out to a shell script
[08:08.500 --> 08:11.240]  that might do something custom to your organization.
[08:13.920 --> 08:16.300]  It's just the whole idea,
[08:16.300 --> 08:18.780]  like one of the very heavy things is what I'm getting at
[08:18.780 --> 08:21.840]  that the Mac does to allow iOS to remain light
[08:21.840 --> 08:25.500]  is if you wanna write an iOS app, you do it on a Mac.
[08:25.500 --> 08:28.660]  So the iPhone doesn't have to worry about things like,
[08:28.660 --> 08:30.620]  well, how in the world are we gonna let developers
[08:30.620 --> 08:33.040]  write iPhone apps on the iPhone?
[08:33.040 --> 08:34.820]  Just, they don't even have to worry about it
[08:34.820 --> 08:37.700]  because they just say you have to use a Mac to do it.
[08:39.180 --> 08:41.700]  This is a good example why, on one hand,
[08:41.700 --> 08:46.180]  me being on the talk show is a useful sort of guide
[08:46.180 --> 08:49.060]  to dithering, on the other hand, it's also a terrible guide
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.680]  because we are now eight minutes and 30 seconds in
[08:52.680 --> 08:55.580]  or nine minutes in and are not even remotely close
[08:55.580 --> 08:57.460]  to getting to whatever point we may have gotten to.
[08:57.460 --> 09:00.920]  I've already got on a Mac, iPad, shell script digression.
[09:00.920 --> 09:02.740]  That wasn't even part of the news I'm talking about,
[09:02.740 --> 09:04.580]  so let's move on.
[09:04.580 --> 09:07.620]  Well, no, it's funny because we've been doing
[09:07.620 --> 09:09.140]  a little bit of a gig on dithering
[09:09.140 --> 09:11.860]  where people are like alternate titles for the show
[09:11.860 --> 09:15.660]  and one of the alternate titles was a brief digression
[09:15.660 --> 09:17.780]  and it's funny because we've actually gotten very good
[09:17.780 --> 09:19.460]  at making them brief digressions
[09:19.460 --> 09:21.160]  whereas the subtitle for the talk show
[09:21.160 --> 09:23.100]  is an extended digression.
[09:23.100 --> 09:26.940]  Right, we have, we could talk about it,
[09:26.940 --> 09:29.740]  but when I do digress while we're doing dithering,
[09:29.740 --> 09:31.860]  I try to, in the back of my head,
[09:31.860 --> 09:33.300]  and I know that I've gone over
[09:33.300 --> 09:35.580]  because I actually can't hold my breath that long,
[09:35.580 --> 09:38.700]  but I think to myself, see if you can do it in one breath.
[09:38.700 --> 09:39.580]  Yep.
[09:39.580 --> 09:42.840]  Because then it might actually be somewhat short.
[09:44.300 --> 09:45.600]  Here, let me just interrupt right now
[09:45.600 --> 09:47.260]  and then we'll start, we'll pretend like we're starting
[09:47.260 --> 09:49.780]  an episode of dithering, but let me just start right now,
[09:49.780 --> 09:53.620]  early on with the first thank you to a sponsor,
[09:53.620 --> 09:55.380]  it's our good friends at Linode.
[09:55.380 --> 09:56.700]  I used to call them Linode
[09:56.700 --> 09:59.220]  because that's what it looks like to me, L-I-N-O-D-E,
[09:59.220 --> 10:01.580]  but it's actually pronounced Linode
[10:01.580 --> 10:04.940]  because it's a node, like a thing, like a server,
[10:04.940 --> 10:08.940]  and they host Linux, which is pronounced lin,
[10:08.940 --> 10:10.860]  so it's Linode, cloud hosting.
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.100]  I guess I should have figured that out,
[10:13.100 --> 10:15.100]  but like a lot of words in the English language,
[10:15.100 --> 10:17.580]  I pronounced it wrong, but you won't pronounce it wrong
[10:17.580 --> 10:20.420]  because you hear me saying it right now.
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.380]  Look, this is where I host Daring Fireball.
[10:22.380 --> 10:26.040]  I love, love, love Linode, everything about it is great.
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.880]  Ever since I moved, I think it was in November
[10:27.880 --> 10:29.860]  when I officially flipped the switch
[10:29.860 --> 10:33.140]  and everything moved over, not one thing has gone wrong.
[10:33.140 --> 10:36.060]  Now, can I guarantee that for you, dear listener,
[10:36.060 --> 10:39.620]  if you start hosting your website at Linode,
[10:39.620 --> 10:40.820]  your servers, your services?
[10:40.820 --> 10:43.180]  No, because maybe you'll screw something up too.
[10:44.120 --> 10:47.500]  Nobody's perfect, but boy, I really like Linode
[10:47.500 --> 10:50.980]  and even if something does go wrong, I guess,
[10:50.980 --> 10:52.700]  you can easily spot what it is.
[10:52.700 --> 10:55.740]  They have awesome, awesome control panel,
[10:55.740 --> 10:57.580]  shows you everything you need to do.
[10:57.580 --> 11:00.760]  They make it really, really easy to install
[11:00.760 --> 11:03.700]  all of the common stuff you might wanna do,
[11:03.700 --> 11:06.580]  like getting WordPress installed
[11:06.580 --> 11:10.380]  or just the regular old-fashioned LAMP stack
[11:10.380 --> 11:15.380]  for MySQL and Apache and PHP and stuff like that.
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.940]  And here's one that I know.
[11:16.940 --> 11:19.240]  I started mentioning this on their sponsorships here
[11:19.240 --> 11:22.740]  a while ago and I keep hearing from listeners at the show
[11:22.740 --> 11:24.500]  because I think a lot of you are roughly
[11:24.500 --> 11:27.420]  in the parental age bracket that I am,
[11:27.420 --> 11:31.460]  game servers for Minecraft and other games.
[11:31.460 --> 11:33.340]  What a great idea, you could host your own,
[11:33.340 --> 11:35.820]  you can have your kid and maybe your kid's friends
[11:35.820 --> 11:38.140]  all have their own little Minecraft server
[11:38.140 --> 11:41.420]  or a bunch of other games that have servers like that.
[11:41.420 --> 11:44.180]  Totally private because you own it, you control it
[11:44.180 --> 11:47.260]  and they have these nanode plans,
[11:47.260 --> 11:49.660]  start at just five bucks a month
[11:49.660 --> 11:52.100]  and it gives you an entire virtual server
[11:52.100 --> 11:55.500]  that you control, super amount of control
[11:55.500 --> 11:58.760]  but also really, really easy interface
[11:58.760 --> 12:01.600]  to control it and make it happen.
[12:01.600 --> 12:04.620]  Five bucks a month and it's a really, really useful server
[12:04.620 --> 12:07.500]  at a plan like that and they scale, Linode scales
[12:07.500 --> 12:10.300]  all the way up to like super, super enterprise needs
[12:10.300 --> 12:13.300]  well beyond anything I could possibly understand.
[12:13.300 --> 12:14.820]  And I have a special offer just for you,
[12:14.820 --> 12:16.980]  listeners of the show, remember this promo code,
[12:16.980 --> 12:21.060]  talk show 20, talk show 20
[12:21.060 --> 12:22.660]  and when you create a new Linode account,
[12:22.660 --> 12:25.100]  you'll get 20 bucks towards your next project
[12:25.100 --> 12:27.720]  which is four months, four months free
[12:27.720 --> 12:29.540]  on that $5 a month plan.
[12:29.540 --> 12:32.860]  Also, they're hiring still, linode.com slash careers,
[12:32.860 --> 12:34.780]  find out more if you're like a sysadmin
[12:34.780 --> 12:36.940]  or anybody who you think, you know,
[12:36.940 --> 12:39.200]  if you think that maybe what you do
[12:39.200 --> 12:41.660]  might have jobs at Linode, you're probably right.
[12:41.660 --> 12:45.300]  So go to linode.com slash the talk show
[12:45.300 --> 12:48.660]  to find out more, linode.com slash the talk show
[12:48.660 --> 12:52.200]  and remember the coupon code talk show 20, save 20 bucks.
[12:54.460 --> 12:57.020]  There you go, that's 15 minutes right there.
[12:57.020 --> 13:00.180]  So we record, we've been recording using Zencastr
[13:00.180 --> 13:03.340]  like a web app instead of the traditional, well Skype.
[13:03.340 --> 13:05.840]  I wanted to mention this because that's the sort of thing,
[13:05.840 --> 13:07.980]  this is the sort of thing that you can't really do
[13:07.980 --> 13:10.100]  on like an iPad.
[13:10.100 --> 13:15.100]  Well, maybe you can, I don't know if you can or not
[13:15.540 --> 13:18.820]  but the point is, is during your ad reads,
[13:18.820 --> 13:20.300]  I didn't have a nice little,
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.660]  because it's all self-contained,
[13:21.660 --> 13:23.780]  it's both the way we're communicating
[13:23.780 --> 13:26.660]  and it's the recording and there's a nice little mute button
[13:26.660 --> 13:28.160]  on there that I can click.
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.260]  But whereas here, because we're using Skype
[13:30.260 --> 13:33.260]  to talk to each other and then I'm recording directly
[13:33.260 --> 13:37.860]  into Audio Hijack, I have to use the hardware mute switch
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.940]  which I also have, but it's a, it was striking
[13:40.940 --> 13:43.900]  that actually I kind of miss my little button
[13:43.900 --> 13:46.300]  in my web app that seems flaky as I'll get out
[13:46.300 --> 13:49.020]  but it seems to be mostly working.
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.780]  It's, Zencastr is an interesting thing.
[13:51.780 --> 13:56.660]  I even love the way they spell it, it's Zen, C-A-S-T-R
[13:56.660 --> 13:59.020]  and that whole just take a vowel thing out.
[13:59.020 --> 14:02.180]  I don't know what happened to that fad, that fad went away.
[14:02.180 --> 14:05.260]  I thought it was pretty clever as a fad
[14:05.260 --> 14:07.900]  because it seemed like an interesting way
[14:07.900 --> 14:10.980]  to get a pronounceable word that gave you a brand
[14:10.980 --> 14:13.460]  but also gave you something that wasn't in the dictionary
[14:13.460 --> 14:18.460]  so it would be more easily searchable and copyrightable
[14:19.020 --> 14:23.300]  and trademarkable I guess is the better term, not copyright.
[14:24.300 --> 14:26.820]  It works really well with R too and that E-R
[14:26.820 --> 14:29.660]  sort of like, it's like something that does an action
[14:29.660 --> 14:32.780]  is a great sort of general thing to get a name for something.
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.540]  Yeah, I don't know if Flickr was first,
[14:34.540 --> 14:36.780]  probably not first but if Flickr's the one
[14:36.780 --> 14:40.740]  that in terms of being like 15 years ago
[14:40.740 --> 14:43.780]  but maybe more is the one that really seemed
[14:43.780 --> 14:45.540]  to make it a thing.
[14:47.100 --> 14:50.500]  Yeah, 16 years, is that amazing?
[14:50.500 --> 14:52.020]  It was pretty close, pretty close.
[14:52.020 --> 14:53.860]  Boy, that feels like a long time ago.
[14:55.180 --> 14:57.220]  What feels longer ago, Flickr being founded
[14:57.220 --> 14:59.260]  or Microsoft's Build keynote yesterday?
[15:01.100 --> 15:03.780]  It all blurs together, it really does.
[15:03.780 --> 15:06.580]  Yesterday's news feels like it was months ago.
[15:08.980 --> 15:11.340]  Or the NBA canceling its season.
[15:11.340 --> 15:14.780]  It just all blurs together, it's so weird.
[15:14.780 --> 15:17.220]  I was just talking to my wife today
[15:17.220 --> 15:20.940]  and again, I know a lot of people are experiencing this
[15:20.940 --> 15:23.260]  and this sort of blurring together
[15:23.260 --> 15:26.020]  of what should be fresh news
[15:26.020 --> 15:28.900]  and what is like three month old news
[15:28.900 --> 15:32.220]  but we were just talking about the president
[15:32.220 --> 15:35.220]  of the United States says he's taking hydroxychloroquine
[15:35.220 --> 15:38.980]  and I spoke about it as though it was like two weeks ago.
[15:38.980 --> 15:40.340]  She was like, that was two days ago.
[15:40.340 --> 15:41.180]  I was like, whoa.
[15:43.460 --> 15:44.300]  Really?
[15:44.300 --> 15:45.780]  I was like, I thought that was a huge issue
[15:45.780 --> 15:47.980]  because it is a huge deal, it's all over everything
[15:47.980 --> 15:50.180]  and I was like, but it's gone now.
[15:50.180 --> 15:52.540]  She goes, well, it is two days old.
[15:53.540 --> 15:56.660]  Yeah, I mean time was already kind of getting,
[15:56.660 --> 15:58.580]  this has been happening on the internet for a long time
[15:58.580 --> 16:00.340]  where time has been compressing
[16:00.340 --> 16:04.820]  and you've seen this in Apple's embargo times or dates.
[16:06.700 --> 16:08.860]  They've experimented different times of day.
[16:08.860 --> 16:10.620]  Do you wanna hit the morning news cycle?
[16:10.620 --> 16:12.500]  Do you wanna hit the evening news cycle?
[16:12.500 --> 16:15.260]  Because it's like you get one or the other
[16:15.260 --> 16:18.940]  because once a half day is gone, the world has moved on.
[16:18.940 --> 16:20.940]  So this compression has been happening
[16:20.940 --> 16:24.220]  but now during the pandemic,
[16:24.220 --> 16:26.140]  that compression is combined
[16:26.140 --> 16:30.180]  with the complete lack of exterior markers of time.
[16:30.180 --> 16:32.220]  So there's like, what's the weekend?
[16:32.220 --> 16:33.060]  What's the workday?
[16:33.060 --> 16:35.260]  It kind of is all flowing together
[16:35.260 --> 16:38.100]  and so I think it's making it even more
[16:38.100 --> 16:40.100]  sort of disconcerting and knowing what's going on.
[16:40.100 --> 16:41.980]  Like I just got a note,
[16:41.980 --> 16:44.220]  oh, I need to make a mention in my daily update today
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.940]  that there's gonna be no daily update on Monday
[16:45.940 --> 16:47.060]  because it's Memorial Day.
[16:47.060 --> 16:48.860]  It's like, Memorial Day?
[16:48.860 --> 16:49.700]  What?
[16:50.700 --> 16:53.060]  How is it that it doesn't even seem possible
[16:53.060 --> 16:54.660]  that it's Memorial Day?
[16:54.660 --> 16:56.060]  You know, we were talking about that,
[16:56.060 --> 16:57.300]  my wife and I were talking about that
[16:57.300 --> 17:01.580]  and I do think it is the case, I think,
[17:01.580 --> 17:02.740]  it's one of those holidays
[17:02.740 --> 17:05.340]  where I don't know the exact algorithm
[17:05.340 --> 17:10.180]  for how you figure out what day of the year is Memorial Day
[17:10.180 --> 17:12.780]  but this year, it's May 25th
[17:12.780 --> 17:16.540]  and I think just looking at the calendar
[17:16.540 --> 17:19.460]  because then that's Monday, that's this coming Monday.
[17:19.460 --> 17:22.420]  The next Monday is June 1st.
[17:22.420 --> 17:25.940]  So I think that it's literally of the seven days
[17:25.940 --> 17:29.900]  of May that could be Memorial Day
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.500]  that May 25th is the earliest possible one
[17:32.500 --> 17:35.500]  and I just feel like of all years for that to happen,
[17:35.500 --> 17:36.340]  this is the worst
[17:36.340 --> 17:40.100]  because it just seems the most discombobulating.
[17:40.100 --> 17:43.900]  It just seems like we just got done making jokes
[17:43.900 --> 17:46.820]  about April being over in a snap of the finger.
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.620]  It's like how in the world are we talking about
[17:49.620 --> 17:52.180]  what are we doing for Memorial Day?
[17:52.180 --> 17:53.020]  I don't know.
[17:53.020 --> 17:54.340]  It's like the 27th or the 28th.
[17:54.340 --> 17:56.260]  Oh yeah, we have a holiday at the end of May, don't we?
[17:56.260 --> 17:58.300]  But now it's like, today is May 21st.
[17:58.300 --> 18:01.820]  It's like that hasn't even, it didn't even,
[18:01.820 --> 18:02.900]  actually no, it's funny
[18:02.900 --> 18:04.780]  because this morning I was looking at my desk,
[18:04.780 --> 18:06.940]  like my desk needs a cleaning.
[18:06.940 --> 18:10.100]  I need to put stuff, it just kind of accumulates over time
[18:10.100 --> 18:14.340]  and I always like to do these cleanings on holidays
[18:14.340 --> 18:16.540]  because the kids are in school,
[18:16.540 --> 18:18.340]  I'm fortunate in that regard,
[18:18.340 --> 18:20.300]  but the kids are in school, I have time,
[18:20.300 --> 18:21.420]  I don't need to write something.
[18:21.420 --> 18:22.660]  So this is a day to go through
[18:22.660 --> 18:25.180]  and really get stuff cleaned up.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.500]  I'm like, oh yeah, I should do that Memorial Day.
[18:26.500 --> 18:28.060]  I'm like, ah, what is that, a few weeks?
[18:28.060 --> 18:29.860]  I didn't even think that it was next week.
[18:29.860 --> 18:31.860]  I was in my head, it was like two or three weeks away.
[18:31.860 --> 18:33.060]  I'm like, I just need to make it through
[18:33.060 --> 18:33.900]  the next two or three weeks
[18:33.900 --> 18:35.660]  and I can get this whole mess cleaned up.
[18:35.660 --> 18:38.660]  But boom, no, it's actually this Monday, who knew?
[18:38.660 --> 18:43.340]  It's also, and it's just a conflation
[18:43.340 --> 18:44.860]  of a bunch of factors.
[18:44.860 --> 18:48.620]  I don't even know, what's the average daily temperature
[18:48.620 --> 18:51.260]  these days in Taipei?
[18:51.260 --> 18:53.060]  Whoa, it's toasty.
[18:53.060 --> 18:55.340]  Like, oh shoot, I'm gonna say Celsius.
[18:55.340 --> 18:57.780]  I'm gonna get you all upset.
[18:57.780 --> 18:58.980]  It's actually relatively cool this week.
[18:58.980 --> 19:01.740]  It's in the 80s, low 80s this week,
[19:01.740 --> 19:04.860]  or maybe 70s to 80s, but very soon it will be in the 90s.
[19:04.860 --> 19:07.380]  But no, I'm looking at today's high is 27,
[19:07.380 --> 19:09.880]  which is about 80 degrees Celsius.
[19:11.060 --> 19:15.740]  It's been a very cold May in the US,
[19:15.740 --> 19:17.980]  at least parts of the US that I follow
[19:17.980 --> 19:19.940]  and certainly where I live,
[19:19.940 --> 19:22.860]  or at least everywhere I've been this month.
[19:22.860 --> 19:24.620]  Which is where you live.
[19:24.620 --> 19:25.780]  Which is where I live.
[19:26.780 --> 19:27.620]  But I think that that-
[19:27.620 --> 19:30.180]  In my extensive travel up and down the block.
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.540]  I think that that makes it,
[19:31.540 --> 19:33.820]  it really makes it even more ridiculous
[19:33.820 --> 19:37.380]  that it's Memorial Day in five days
[19:37.380 --> 19:40.480]  because it's like I've only worn shorts on two days.
[19:40.480 --> 19:44.680]  And I'm not an aggressive get the shorts out
[19:44.680 --> 19:45.820]  while it's still cold,
[19:45.820 --> 19:50.100]  but I'm on the leading edge of switching
[19:50.100 --> 19:51.500]  from jeans to shorts.
[19:52.340 --> 19:54.420]  And I've only worn shorts like two days.
[19:54.420 --> 19:55.780]  Although I'm wearing shorts today,
[19:55.780 --> 19:58.300]  even though it was only 60 degrees,
[19:58.300 --> 20:00.140]  you'll never guess why.
[20:00.140 --> 20:01.900]  You were moving charcoal?
[20:01.900 --> 20:02.740]  I bet.
[20:04.680 --> 20:05.720]  My belt broke.
[20:07.500 --> 20:10.160]  And none of my jeans really stay up without a belt.
[20:10.160 --> 20:15.160]  It's just, I don't think I buy the wrong size jeans.
[20:15.860 --> 20:17.320]  I just, I don't really,
[20:17.320 --> 20:19.700]  it runs on my dad's side of the family.
[20:19.700 --> 20:22.660]  We don't really have much in the way of hips.
[20:22.660 --> 20:25.860]  So pants just tend to slide right down.
[20:25.860 --> 20:27.480]  So I've always been a belt wearer,
[20:27.480 --> 20:29.820]  but now I don't, my belt's half broken.
[20:29.820 --> 20:31.020]  It's sort of like,
[20:31.020 --> 20:32.140]  so I just put shorts on
[20:32.140 --> 20:34.940]  instead of making do with a broken belt.
[20:34.940 --> 20:37.900]  Have you ever considered a shift to suspenders?
[20:37.900 --> 20:38.740]  With my jeans?
[20:38.740 --> 20:40.260]  No, I have not.
[20:40.260 --> 20:41.820]  But see, here's the thing.
[20:41.820 --> 20:43.740]  It's a broken belt and this is the thing,
[20:43.740 --> 20:47.660]  I only own one belt and it's lasted me for years.
[20:47.660 --> 20:50.020]  I don't remember the last time I had to replace it.
[20:50.020 --> 20:55.020]  And I am clearly in dad clothes territory
[20:55.420 --> 21:00.420]  where obviously a lot of my shirts and jeans and et cetera
[21:00.420 --> 21:04.380]  are a lot older than I probably would guess that they are.
[21:04.380 --> 21:05.980]  I don't remember when I bought this belt.
[21:05.980 --> 21:07.080]  It served me well.
[21:07.080 --> 21:11.080]  But what I would do if it weren't quarantine
[21:11.080 --> 21:14.640]  is I would have just gone out like yesterday
[21:14.640 --> 21:17.500]  and just gone from store to store
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.880]  in Center City, Philadelphia
[21:18.880 --> 21:21.800]  until I found an acceptable belt to my eyes
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.380]  and then I'd have a belt.
[21:23.380 --> 21:25.560]  And it would have been probably,
[21:25.560 --> 21:27.140]  you know, you can't predict because who knows,
[21:27.140 --> 21:28.880]  maybe the first store I would have popped into,
[21:28.880 --> 21:30.080]  maybe they wouldn't have had a belt
[21:30.080 --> 21:33.840]  or maybe they wouldn't have had one, you know, in my size.
[21:33.840 --> 21:34.680]  It could happen.
[21:34.680 --> 21:37.840]  But I would guess within 90 minutes,
[21:37.840 --> 21:39.440]  I could leave my house
[21:39.440 --> 21:41.520]  and then I would be in possession of a new belt.
[21:41.520 --> 21:44.080]  But now in quarantine time, you have to order it
[21:44.080 --> 21:47.600]  and, you know, it takes a long time.
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.600]  Now I don't have a belt.
[21:48.600 --> 21:51.020]  It's an amazing allegory for the entire system.
[21:51.020 --> 21:56.020]  You are utilizing just-in-time apparel purchases
[21:56.400 --> 21:59.880]  where no need for you to carry inventory.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.120]  You have what you need.
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.360]  If it breaks, you can tap right into the supply chain
[22:05.360 --> 22:06.800]  and it's there.
[22:06.800 --> 22:11.240]  But now it turns out you had no slack in the system
[22:11.240 --> 22:14.120]  as it were and you're in trouble.
[22:14.120 --> 22:16.280]  So I've got shorts on and my legs are cold.
[22:18.200 --> 22:19.640]  So I should let this go.
[22:19.640 --> 22:21.260]  Speaking of a brief digression,
[22:21.260 --> 22:24.140]  so you grew up in Wisconsin.
[22:26.080 --> 22:28.280]  When did you move to Asia?
[22:28.280 --> 22:29.200]  How old were you?
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.080]  I was 23 in 2003.
[22:33.080 --> 22:37.880]  So how long did it take you to get used in your head
[22:37.880 --> 22:40.720]  to Celsius as the,
[22:41.800 --> 22:44.420]  because everybody, any longtime listeners know,
[22:44.420 --> 22:45.920]  this is a hobby horse of mine.
[22:46.880 --> 22:51.160]  Yeah, I'm actually on board with the Fahrenheit
[22:51.160 --> 22:53.600]  is more human legible and usable.
[22:53.600 --> 22:55.260]  So I actually agree with you.
[22:55.260 --> 22:56.360]  I'm not gonna give you a fight on it.
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.640]  But I do use Celsius here
[22:58.640 --> 23:00.200]  just because everyone else uses Celsius.
[23:00.200 --> 23:02.960]  So usually if you're talking about the weather,
[23:02.960 --> 23:06.140]  you're talking about the weather with people here.
[23:06.140 --> 23:08.080]  I don't know, it didn't take too long.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.800]  The thing that always stuck in my head
[23:09.800 --> 23:13.800]  is that 28 degrees in Celsius is 82 degrees in Fahrenheit.
[23:13.800 --> 23:17.280]  And then it's like 1.9 degrees around that.
[23:17.280 --> 23:19.880]  And given that it's generally warm here,
[23:19.880 --> 23:23.200]  that was enough of a, I could get close enough in my head
[23:23.200 --> 23:25.140]  until over time you just kind of get used to it
[23:25.140 --> 23:27.480]  and you know how something feels.
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.720]  But it's funny because a couple of years ago
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.060]  I moved up to the sort of more traditional
[23:33.060 --> 23:36.040]  foreigner neighborhood in Taiwan.
[23:36.040 --> 23:38.000]  Just my kids go to the American school here
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.620]  and just be closer to that.
[23:39.620 --> 23:42.440]  And it's funny, the folks up here,
[23:42.440 --> 23:44.840]  or especially the foreigners are also,
[23:44.840 --> 23:47.280]  I'm friends with several Fahrenheit diehards.
[23:47.280 --> 23:51.800]  So I've been stuck in this weird middle ground
[23:51.800 --> 23:53.880]  where I fully adapted to Celsius.
[23:53.880 --> 23:55.640]  I went native as it were.
[23:55.640 --> 23:59.320]  And now I'm being faced with Fahrenheit truthers
[23:59.320 --> 24:02.120]  on a regular day-to-day basis and it's a little disorienting
[24:02.120 --> 24:05.680]  But you're, because of your, it's like being bilingual.
[24:05.680 --> 24:09.780]  It's very similar, but you could hear either one
[24:09.780 --> 24:12.960]  and you kind of have a good idea.
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.200]  Like if somebody says, oh my God, it's 61 degrees
[24:17.200 --> 24:20.440]  and you know that it's Memorial Day,
[24:20.440 --> 24:24.120]  you realize that's pretty chilly for Fahrenheit
[24:24.120 --> 24:26.080]  for Memorial Day weekend, 61 degrees.
[24:26.080 --> 24:27.400]  Yeah, that's right.
[24:27.400 --> 24:29.960]  And I think this is maybe the case with Pinnacle is also
[24:29.960 --> 24:33.520]  like when other people say it, I'm fine to absorb it
[24:33.520 --> 24:35.280]  but it's when they want me to produce it
[24:35.280 --> 24:38.120]  where I'm like locked into one way of thinking, right?
[24:38.120 --> 24:40.540]  So I'm thinking about it or I look it up my phone
[24:40.540 --> 24:42.260]  and like, oh, that's the temperature is like,
[24:42.260 --> 24:43.520]  oh, how's it feel today?
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.680]  And I'm like, you know, or what's the temperature?
[24:45.680 --> 24:48.200]  And then I want to help them and translate
[24:48.200 --> 24:49.160]  and that's when it gets trickier.
[24:49.160 --> 24:51.400]  But if they say, oh yeah, it's going to be in the seventies
[24:51.400 --> 24:54.400]  then yeah, I still have the sort of latent knowledge
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.920]  of what I usually go back to the US every year.
[24:55.920 --> 24:57.820]  So I'm used to switching back and forth.
[24:57.820 --> 25:00.160]  But yeah, it's interesting.
[25:00.160 --> 25:02.200]  I've never thought about the particulars
[25:02.200 --> 25:05.460]  of switching back and forth between temperature systems
[25:05.460 --> 25:06.640]  but it does happen.
[25:06.640 --> 25:08.720]  I don't think I would ever be able to get used to it.
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.760]  I guess it's probably a lot of all the other problems
[25:12.760 --> 25:15.040]  I might have moving to another country,
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.080]  especially if it's spoke a different language,
[25:17.080 --> 25:21.400]  I'd probably adjust sooner to the Celsius,
[25:21.400 --> 25:23.360]  but I never, I don't know.
[25:23.360 --> 25:24.720]  It doesn't make any sense to me.
[25:24.720 --> 25:26.200]  I've told this story before,
[25:26.200 --> 25:27.920]  but it's still my favorite is,
[25:27.920 --> 25:30.420]  and I'm not like a radical on the issue.
[25:30.420 --> 25:33.400]  I just staunchly believe that Fahrenheit
[25:33.400 --> 25:37.240]  is a better scale for weather
[25:37.240 --> 25:39.360]  because it's based on the human condition,
[25:39.360 --> 25:42.440]  not who gives a crap what the boiling point of water is.
[25:42.440 --> 25:44.620]  It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life
[25:44.620 --> 25:45.460]  that that's what-
[25:45.460 --> 25:47.600]  No, I mean Celsius is not precise enough, right?
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.160]  So in the car, it adjusts it by 0.5
[25:52.160 --> 25:55.320]  because it's too much for a car.
[25:55.320 --> 25:57.860]  So yeah, it's a fair, whereas Fahrenheit,
[25:57.860 --> 26:01.280]  it's more finely grained in a positive way.
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.280]  Right, well, we were talking about this.
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.080]  And as we learned more about the COVID-19,
[26:08.080 --> 26:11.640]  we realized that fever is still a very common symptom,
[26:11.640 --> 26:16.280]  but there's plenty of people who wind up terribly ill
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.840]  who never have a fever, so it doesn't really prove anything.
[26:20.840 --> 26:23.480]  But in the early days, they were like,
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.920]  it was a lot of make sure you don't have a fever.
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.680]  And even now, I think you say
[26:30.680 --> 26:32.720]  that when you guys go out to eat,
[26:32.720 --> 26:34.440]  you get a temperature check.
[26:34.440 --> 26:37.040]  And I know that that's a worldwide thing at airports
[26:37.040 --> 26:39.560]  as the airports prepare for the return
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.520]  to some semblance of normalcy with travel,
[26:42.520 --> 26:45.280]  that passengers will be given temperature checks.
[26:45.280 --> 26:47.320]  Just anybody has a raging fever,
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.860]  let's get them out of the queue.
[26:52.560 --> 26:54.620]  But I don't understand how you do it here.
[26:54.620 --> 26:59.320]  You get two degrees high, hey, you might have a fever.
[26:59.320 --> 27:02.280]  In Celsius, it's like a 10th of a degree off,
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.840]  and you got a fever?
[27:03.840 --> 27:05.100]  I mean, it's crazy.
[27:05.100 --> 27:08.280]  It is funny, because that's one I've had a harder time,
[27:08.280 --> 27:10.240]  but it's weird because, I think,
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.240]  because I paid much more attention to fever temperatures
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.120]  once I had kids than before,
[27:16.120 --> 27:18.600]  and so it's super locked into my head,
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.840]  the Celsius numbers that are relevant for fevers.
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.580]  And I actually have a hard time with Fahrenheit,
[27:23.580 --> 27:25.520]  where it's like, oh, it was like 103 temperature.
[27:25.520 --> 27:26.540]  I'm like, what does that mean?
[27:26.540 --> 27:27.380]  Is that bad?
[27:27.380 --> 27:28.200]  It sounds pretty bad.
[27:28.200 --> 27:29.040]  That's really bad.
[27:29.040 --> 27:31.760]  That's like go pour ice into the tub,
[27:31.760 --> 27:34.600]  and you're in big trouble.
[27:34.600 --> 27:35.680]  100, no, it's nice,
[27:35.680 --> 27:38.420]  because 100 means you probably have a fever.
[27:39.800 --> 27:44.800]  Right, but 100 is 38.3 degrees Celsius,
[27:45.240 --> 27:50.240]  but in Celsius, it's 37, so 37 is 98.6 Fahrenheit.
[27:50.800 --> 27:53.800]  Well, I mean, 98, what is it, 98.4?
[27:53.800 --> 27:54.640]  What is the Fahrenheit normal?
[27:54.640 --> 27:55.840]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[27:55.840 --> 27:56.960]  I just linked to this.
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.980]  For over 100 years, it was considered 98.6,
[28:00.980 --> 28:03.560]  and 98.6 was considered normal,
[28:03.560 --> 28:06.240]  and now they're saying, experts are saying,
[28:06.240 --> 28:08.720]  the average healthy human temperature
[28:08.720 --> 28:10.720]  is actually lower than 98.6,
[28:10.720 --> 28:12.140]  but they don't tell you what it is.
[28:12.140 --> 28:14.140]  They're not saying it's 98.2.
[28:14.140 --> 28:17.160]  They're just like, oh, it's not 98.6,
[28:17.160 --> 28:20.360]  and the reason we've said 98.6 for 100 years
[28:20.360 --> 28:23.040]  was that there was some guy in the 1890s
[28:23.040 --> 28:25.320]  who went around and did the hard work
[28:25.320 --> 28:27.760]  of taking the temperature, like 5,000 people,
[28:27.760 --> 28:30.120]  and figured out the average is 98.6,
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.320]  but the consensus now is that everybody back then
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.280]  was actually sick all the time because.
[28:35.280 --> 28:37.080]  Right, but this is an example where the test one is easier.
[28:37.080 --> 28:39.260]  37 is normal and 38 is a fever.
[28:39.260 --> 28:40.920]  Like, you don't have to get,
[28:40.920 --> 28:42.440]  there's no decimal points necessary.
[28:42.440 --> 28:46.500]  So maybe just by sort of, by luck, in happenstance,
[28:46.500 --> 28:49.440]  it happens to be around numbers, but yeah.
[28:49.440 --> 28:52.160]  Yeah, but 100 sounds dangerous, you know what I mean?
[28:52.160 --> 28:52.980]  That's the thing.
[28:52.980 --> 28:54.860]  See, that's the thing that I love about Fahrenheit
[28:54.860 --> 28:56.640]  and arguing with people about it
[28:56.640 --> 28:59.240]  is that the beauty of the metric system
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.360]  is this idea that it's based on, you know,
[29:03.360 --> 29:06.080]  that hundreds and thousands and powers of 10
[29:06.080 --> 29:10.120]  are useful, you know, scales,
[29:10.120 --> 29:12.960]  and it makes all the math work out easier,
[29:12.960 --> 29:15.200]  you know, and it's crazy, you know,
[29:15.200 --> 29:16.360]  and I'm trying to shift.
[29:16.360 --> 29:17.540]  You know, I'm doing a lot more,
[29:17.540 --> 29:20.260]  like on Daring Fireball with weights using,
[29:21.400 --> 29:23.940]  with length, I'm a little bit less consistent,
[29:23.940 --> 29:25.160]  but like certainly with weight,
[29:25.160 --> 29:28.480]  I appreciate grams versus ounces
[29:28.480 --> 29:31.600]  because the ounces to pounds thing is just, it's the...
[29:31.600 --> 29:33.760]  It's insanity. It's insanity, it's just...
[29:33.760 --> 29:35.440]  Well, no, but inches to feet are too.
[29:35.440 --> 29:37.240]  Like anything that's not, I mean,
[29:37.240 --> 29:39.800]  but that's the thing is the temperature,
[29:39.800 --> 29:42.240]  Celsius is a total bullshit metric, right?
[29:42.240 --> 29:44.100]  If you want to be, if you want to say
[29:44.100 --> 29:45.280]  you're quote unquote scientific,
[29:45.280 --> 29:46.400]  you should be using Kelvin
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.440]  because that's actually has a root in reality,
[29:49.440 --> 29:51.440]  which is at zero, nothing's moving.
[29:51.440 --> 29:56.440]  No, but I'm saying Celsius is a totally arbitrary, right?
[29:56.640 --> 29:58.240]  So I'm with you.
[29:58.240 --> 30:00.520]  I think for humans, actually,
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.960]  the most human-friendly set of measurements
[30:03.960 --> 30:06.240]  is basically metric for everything
[30:06.240 --> 30:07.120]  and Fahrenheit for temperature.
[30:07.120 --> 30:08.860]  So I'm there with you.
[30:08.860 --> 30:11.440]  Somebody, I was on a Twitter fight with somebody,
[30:11.440 --> 30:14.480]  and it's actually one of the best and funnest things
[30:14.480 --> 30:15.920]  to argue about on Twitter
[30:15.920 --> 30:18.080]  because there are people who feel very strongly
[30:18.080 --> 30:18.960]  on both sides.
[30:18.960 --> 30:21.400]  There are some diehard Celsius people,
[30:21.400 --> 30:24.160]  and there's me who's very staunchly Fahrenheit,
[30:24.160 --> 30:25.560]  but yet not so much so
[30:25.560 --> 30:27.760]  that if I were to travel to another country
[30:27.760 --> 30:30.360]  that I would insist on the hotel concierge
[30:30.360 --> 30:33.160]  telling me the temperature of Fahrenheit,
[30:33.160 --> 30:35.400]  when in Rome do as the Romans,
[30:35.400 --> 30:37.120]  but it never gets ugly.
[30:37.120 --> 30:41.160]  It is a very fun dispute that's famous last words.
[30:41.160 --> 30:43.720]  God, somebody's probably gonna get furious at me now,
[30:43.720 --> 30:45.840]  but it's very fun, but somebody suggested,
[30:45.840 --> 30:47.360]  and I have to, it's too late now.
[30:47.360 --> 30:49.000]  We can't even pick between these two,
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.320]  but if you could go back and pick the ideal scale,
[30:52.320 --> 30:55.160]  you'd keep zero at Celsius zero,
[30:55.160 --> 30:57.560]  which is where water freezes
[30:57.560 --> 30:59.800]  and keep 100 at Fahrenheit's 100.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  So Fahrenheit's 100 would still be 100,
[31:06.240 --> 31:10.280]  and zero would be what we now call 32 degrees Fahrenheit
[31:10.280 --> 31:11.120]  because freezing.
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.000]  No, I don't like that
[31:12.000 --> 31:14.720]  because the problem is negative numbers are weird, right?
[31:14.720 --> 31:15.560]  I like it if you get to negative numbers.
[31:15.560 --> 31:17.680]  Yeah, you'd be negative all the time, right.
[31:17.680 --> 31:18.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:18.520 --> 31:21.640]  Whereas, I'm from Wisconsin where I like Fahrenheit.
[31:21.640 --> 31:23.840]  I think actually it's on the bottom of the scale.
[31:23.840 --> 31:25.680]  It's in the bottom and the top where it makes the most sense.
[31:25.680 --> 31:26.800]  The middle gets fuzzy.
[31:26.800 --> 31:29.400]  Like if your 90s is really hot
[31:29.400 --> 31:32.040]  and the single digits is really cold
[31:32.040 --> 31:33.440]  and if it's a negative digits,
[31:33.440 --> 31:36.560]  it's like, you know, like it's,
[31:36.560 --> 31:38.200]  or if it's over 100 or less than zero,
[31:38.200 --> 31:39.280]  then it's like extreme.
[31:39.280 --> 31:40.120]  Like it's potentially dangerous.
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.120]  It's dangerous, it's dangerous.
[31:41.120 --> 31:42.240]  You could die, yeah.
[31:42.240 --> 31:44.200]  Like when you're watching an NFL football game
[31:44.200 --> 31:47.720]  and they tell you that the Lambo is negative 17
[31:47.720 --> 31:49.240]  or something like that, it's like, forget about it.
[31:49.240 --> 31:50.080]  You know what I mean?
[31:50.080 --> 31:50.900]  Like I don't even,
[31:50.900 --> 31:52.680]  I can't even understand how they're doing this.
[31:53.840 --> 31:55.160]  My favorite, here's my favorite story.
[31:55.160 --> 31:56.000]  I gotta tell this.
[31:56.000 --> 31:56.840]  I know I've told it before,
[31:56.840 --> 31:58.240]  but I don't think I've told it in years,
[31:58.240 --> 32:03.240]  but oh man, it was at some point 10, 15 years ago,
[32:05.820 --> 32:08.120]  the Intercontinental San Francisco went up
[32:08.120 --> 32:10.520]  and that's the hotel right next to Moscone.
[32:11.560 --> 32:12.400]  Nice hotel.
[32:12.400 --> 32:14.340]  I've stayed there numerous times over the years.
[32:14.340 --> 32:15.740]  Always enjoyed it.
[32:15.740 --> 32:18.360]  For whatever reason, when it first went up,
[32:18.360 --> 32:22.280]  it had the most unbelievable hotel rates.
[32:22.280 --> 32:24.480]  It didn't make any sense.
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.040]  Like just booking through their site
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.800]  was relatively inexpensive
[32:27.800 --> 32:29.760]  compared to just downtown San Francisco.
[32:29.760 --> 32:34.080]  Although this is talking like 2008, 2009, 2010 maybe.
[32:34.080 --> 32:36.760]  Right now hotels, the average hotel room in San Francisco
[32:36.760 --> 32:39.920]  pre-pandemic was like $5,000 a night or something.
[32:41.680 --> 32:44.440]  The old days when they were reasonable,
[32:44.440 --> 32:46.960]  but then you could go to like those bargain hunting sites,
[32:46.960 --> 32:49.260]  you know, like a Hotwire or something like that.
[32:49.260 --> 32:50.200]  And they wouldn't tell you.
[32:50.200 --> 32:52.320]  You'd be like, well, I wanna go to Moscone.
[32:52.320 --> 32:53.680]  And they'd say, here's some offers.
[32:53.680 --> 32:56.160]  And they'd say, this place is within 0.5 miles
[32:56.160 --> 32:57.400]  of where you wanna go.
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.500]  But then you could backwards engineer
[32:59.500 --> 33:01.760]  which one was which by like their amenities.
[33:01.760 --> 33:03.840]  Well, this one says they have an indoor pool
[33:03.840 --> 33:05.800]  and a workout center.
[33:05.800 --> 33:08.020]  And the only one that's within half a mile of this
[33:08.020 --> 33:10.960]  that has those two amenities is the Intercontinental.
[33:10.960 --> 33:12.600]  You know, you didn't have to do that work yourself.
[33:12.600 --> 33:14.160]  There were like forums you could go to
[33:14.160 --> 33:15.760]  and then they'd tell you, you know.
[33:15.760 --> 33:17.760]  So then you could, there were a bunch of us,
[33:17.760 --> 33:19.620]  a bunch of pals and we booked like a hotel
[33:19.620 --> 33:22.200]  for the week of WWDC at the Intercontinental,
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.940]  which is like a four and a half star hotel.
[33:23.940 --> 33:24.780]  We got it for like, I don't know,
[33:24.780 --> 33:26.500]  it was like $150 a night.
[33:26.500 --> 33:27.400]  It was ridiculous.
[33:27.400 --> 33:30.460]  And anybody who's gone to WWDC
[33:30.460 --> 33:33.520]  since they moved to San Jose is like, you know,
[33:33.520 --> 33:36.440]  like laughing at this because you stay at like
[33:36.440 --> 33:40.840]  a one star hotel in San Jose and it's $500 a night.
[33:40.840 --> 33:42.240]  And you're still in San Jose.
[33:42.240 --> 33:44.020]  Yeah, and you're still in San Jose.
[33:44.020 --> 33:45.680]  So anyway, it wasn't the first time.
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.320]  I don't think I was there, but maybe it was.
[33:48.320 --> 33:49.840]  Maybe it was the very first time
[33:49.840 --> 33:52.760]  I was at the Intercontinental San Francisco.
[33:52.760 --> 33:56.680]  Very nice, I check in, I get up to my room
[33:56.680 --> 34:00.040]  and I go in and it probably was the first time.
[34:00.040 --> 34:02.480]  And one thing I always do when I get to a hotel
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.960]  is I check the temperature on the thermostat
[34:04.960 --> 34:07.520]  because I like it nice and cool when I sleep at night.
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.900]  And I go over and it was in Celsius.
[34:09.900 --> 34:13.100]  And I thought, oh, I get I'm at the Intercontinental.
[34:13.100 --> 34:16.280]  It's, you know, got an international flair.
[34:16.280 --> 34:17.740]  They're gonna do it in Celsius.
[34:17.740 --> 34:19.800]  And I thought, well, that's, you know, good enough.
[34:19.800 --> 34:21.000]  And I thought, well, I'll give it a down.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.680]  I gave it like one down click, you know,
[34:22.680 --> 34:23.600]  move it down a degree.
[34:23.600 --> 34:24.840]  And I was like, hell, in Celsius,
[34:24.840 --> 34:26.860]  I probably just moved it down, you know,
[34:26.860 --> 34:29.640]  five degrees in real temperatures.
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.920]  Go to dinner, go out with friends, have a couple drinks,
[34:33.920 --> 34:36.440]  come back, you know, get a good night's sleep.
[34:36.440 --> 34:39.120]  I wake up in the middle of the night and I got this sweat.
[34:39.120 --> 34:40.280]  Like, you just wouldn't believe.
[34:40.280 --> 34:42.580]  I mean, like, I'm in like a horror movie.
[34:42.580 --> 34:44.920]  I mean, it's like, and I'm like, did I eat something bad?
[34:44.920 --> 34:45.760]  What's going on?
[34:45.760 --> 34:47.800]  I feel terrible.
[34:47.800 --> 34:51.320]  And I gotta get some water, I drink, and I get up
[34:51.320 --> 34:52.760]  and I'm like, I'm just hot.
[34:52.760 --> 34:54.480]  I was like, oh my God, this is our first night.
[34:54.480 --> 34:55.320]  I came out here.
[34:55.320 --> 34:56.280]  I'm supposed to be here all week.
[34:56.280 --> 34:58.480]  I don't know if it was Macworld or WWDC or what,
[34:58.480 --> 35:00.560]  but I really thought that I was sick.
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.640]  I thought the best case I got food poisoning,
[35:02.640 --> 35:04.440]  worst case I'm coming down with something.
[35:04.440 --> 35:06.040]  I got a fever.
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.920]  And then I think, well, let me check the temperature.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.920]  And I thought, oh, yeah, it's Celsius.
[35:09.920 --> 35:12.880]  And I figured out, I'd like Googled or used my phone
[35:12.880 --> 35:14.920]  or something to figure it out.
[35:14.920 --> 35:17.240]  Well, son of a bitch, it was, whatever it was in Celsius
[35:17.240 --> 35:22.920]  was like 84 degrees Fahrenheit and the heat was on in a room.
[35:22.920 --> 35:26.920]  I mean, so like some son of a bitch.
[35:26.920 --> 35:29.400]  No, whatever it was, the system was off.
[35:29.400 --> 35:32.080]  And then you hit the button and that turned it on,
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.440]  but you set it to 29, which would be 84 degrees.
[35:35.440 --> 35:37.120]  And then it kicked on the heat.
[35:37.120 --> 35:38.520]  It was definitely in the 20s.
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.920]  I don't remember what the number was, but it was in the 20s.
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.040]  And I thought, well, that sounds pretty cool.
[35:43.040 --> 35:45.320]  And I let it go.
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.960]  No, but I came in and I hit down arrow.
[35:47.960 --> 35:50.600]  So I should have only been able to move it down.
[35:50.600 --> 35:53.840]  I think some son of a bitch, like the way
[35:53.840 --> 35:55.720]  that like a prankster at a restaurant
[35:55.720 --> 35:58.600]  might unscrew the top of a salt shaker.
[35:58.600 --> 36:01.160]  And then you go to get the salt, but because they unscrewed it,
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.400]  now you dump the whole container of salt on your meal.
[36:06.400 --> 36:09.160]  I personally never did that when I was a teenager.
[36:09.160 --> 36:13.280]  I mean, I don't see any humor in that sort of prank at all.
[36:13.280 --> 36:16.720]  I think some prankster cranked the heat up on the room
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.800]  and set it Celsius, because then I
[36:19.800 --> 36:21.840]  went back to the Intercontinental many times
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.000]  over the years, never once.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.120]  And I never got fooled by that again,
[36:25.120 --> 36:29.320]  but it was never even in Celsius again.
[36:29.320 --> 36:33.200]  So anyway, that may or may not have hardened my stance
[36:33.200 --> 36:35.920]  on Fahrenheit versus Celsius.
[36:35.920 --> 36:38.360]  The root, the root of the issue.
[36:38.360 --> 36:40.160]  Oh, this is such a leisurely conversation.
[36:40.160 --> 36:42.480]  It's seriously kind of jarring.
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.760]  All right, well, let's dig in, because the one thing
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.360]  I know we want to talk about is we want to talk about podcasts,
[36:50.360 --> 36:53.080]  because we have a new podcast and we want to talk about that.
[36:53.080 --> 36:55.400]  But literally, who knows?
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.160]  There might have been more news today even.
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.200]  But as of yesterday, there was big, big news
[37:00.200 --> 37:01.480]  in the podcast world.
[37:01.480 --> 37:04.720]  And I don't think it's an exaggeration,
[37:04.720 --> 37:08.440]  because by anybody's metrics, Joe Rogan's show
[37:08.440 --> 37:11.240]  is the second most popular podcast in the world.
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.320]  And it bounces back and forth between one and two.
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.040]  So I think it's safe to say it's
[37:15.040 --> 37:17.240]  the most popular podcast, because he also
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.800]  has a massive YouTube presence, where
[37:18.800 --> 37:20.000]  it's like sort of simulcast.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.480]  So I think I'd feel comfortable calling him the biggest
[37:22.480 --> 37:23.560]  podcaster in the world.
[37:23.560 --> 37:26.640]  And the one that's currently ahead of him
[37:26.640 --> 37:29.720]  is called Call Me Daddy, I think.
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.840]  Right, which is a big, and the reason it's above him
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.800]  is because there's a big controversy around it,
[37:34.800 --> 37:38.520]  which is actually super duper interesting.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.920]  But no, Rogan is usually number one.
[37:40.920 --> 37:42.800]  That's just number one right now because of the controversy.
[37:42.800 --> 37:44.520]  But although that's also a huge podcast,
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.360]  usually in the top 20 or something like that.
[37:46.360 --> 37:47.840]  All right.
[37:47.840 --> 37:49.960]  And anyway, so the big deal yesterday
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.000]  was that Joe Rogan, perhaps arguably the most popular
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.320]  podcaster on the planet, announced a deal with Spotify
[37:59.320 --> 38:01.880]  to move his show not just to Spotify,
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.040]  but to move it there exclusively by the end of the year.
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.920]  Meaning at some point in the next few months,
[38:08.920 --> 38:11.280]  the show will move to Spotify, but you can,
[38:12.640 --> 38:14.520]  you could still listen to it wherever
[38:14.520 --> 38:16.840]  you're currently listening to it,
[38:16.840 --> 38:21.840]  using Overcast or Apple Podcasts or Castro or any,
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.080]  I mean, I don't know how many podcast apps there are.
[38:24.080 --> 38:25.840]  I mean, there's dozens and dozens of,
[38:25.840 --> 38:28.000]  all of them, to some degree, popular.
[38:29.320 --> 38:33.080]  Which is sort of the point of podcasting being an open,
[38:34.120 --> 38:35.160]  an open medium.
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.960]  They'll still work, but by the end of the year,
[38:37.960 --> 38:40.480]  you're either using Spotify to listen to Joe Rogan
[38:40.480 --> 38:42.680]  or you're not listening to Joe Rogan.
[38:44.040 --> 38:45.160]  That's right.
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.760]  Yeah, and so this is different than what they've done
[38:48.760 --> 38:51.680]  with acquiring The Ringer or acquiring Gimlet Media.
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.200]  Those, both Gimlet and The Ringer have launched podcasts
[38:55.200 --> 38:59.320]  that are Spotify exclusives, but the big podcast
[38:59.320 --> 39:01.960]  that sort of already existed on those services,
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.360]  you know, like the Bill Simmons podcast,
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.360]  which I know we both listen to,
[39:05.360 --> 39:07.500]  is still available sort of broadly.
[39:07.500 --> 39:09.480]  I do think it does raise the question,
[39:09.480 --> 39:11.280]  how long that's going to last,
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.840]  because the whole point of doing this exclusive is,
[39:15.840 --> 39:18.640]  I mean, there's so many angles to this,
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.600]  but my strong point of view is that Spotify
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.600]  is looking to build sort of a advertising service
[39:27.060 --> 39:30.160]  around podcasts that's about streaming
[39:30.160 --> 39:33.200]  and dynamically giving you ads that are tailored to you,
[39:33.200 --> 39:35.560]  as opposed to sort of, you know, your ads,
[39:35.560 --> 39:38.040]  you know, the Linode ad, everyone gets it.
[39:38.040 --> 39:40.160]  There's some podcasts that do,
[39:40.160 --> 39:42.880]  they insert ads on download that are based on IP,
[39:42.880 --> 39:45.960]  but, you know, giving you an ad based on your IP address
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.280]  is the barest possible of sort of like customization.
[39:49.280 --> 39:51.080]  It doesn't know anything about you and your interests
[39:51.080 --> 39:53.560]  and et cetera, et cetera, like a Facebook ad, for example.
[39:53.560 --> 39:56.860]  And so Facebook, you know, but for Spotify to do this
[39:56.860 --> 39:58.720]  and to not sort of be paying out of the nose
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.560]  for every podcaster, they need to basically show
[40:02.560 --> 40:05.760]  they can monetize podcasts better than you can on your own,
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.880]  but that means they need to pull over more users
[40:07.880 --> 40:08.960]  under their platform.
[40:08.960 --> 40:12.000]  And so the play here is they have, you know,
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.760]  20% share of the market or something along those lines,
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.480]  and can they, most of Spotify's growth
[40:18.480 --> 40:20.120]  has been new users, right?
[40:20.120 --> 40:22.960]  Apple Podcast hasn't necessarily lost listeners,
[40:22.960 --> 40:25.120]  over here it hasn't lost people to Spotify.
[40:25.120 --> 40:28.160]  It's Spotify has brought new people into podcasting,
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.040]  which by the way, I think is worth noting
[40:31.040 --> 40:34.920]  because they are to date, in generally speaking,
[40:34.920 --> 40:37.480]  have been a net contributor to the overall ecosystem.
[40:37.480 --> 40:40.280]  But now they're trying to not just get new listeners,
[40:40.280 --> 40:41.780]  but to yank a bunch of listeners
[40:41.780 --> 40:43.240]  from the other podcast players.
[40:43.240 --> 40:45.600]  Yeah, and I think it's worth,
[40:45.600 --> 40:48.840]  and it's not an original observation,
[40:48.840 --> 40:51.800]  but it's so interesting that I think it's worth noting
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.760]  is that podcasts are the one area of the web
[40:55.760 --> 40:58.680]  that ad tech hasn't ruined.
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.020]  And you know, it's funny, I wasn't really planning it
[41:01.020 --> 41:03.480]  and a lot of that, as often happens with this show,
[41:03.480 --> 41:06.480]  but it ties in to our opening where we were talking
[41:06.480 --> 41:09.020]  about ads wrecking a browser tab.
[41:11.460 --> 41:14.320]  It really is the case that, you know,
[41:14.320 --> 41:17.280]  like I think you just mentioned the Punch the Monkey ad,
[41:17.280 --> 41:20.080]  right, which famous is sort of like the first banner ad
[41:20.080 --> 41:23.100]  that people remember from like the late 90s.
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.620]  And people were annoyed by it because banner ads seemed dumb.
[41:27.620 --> 41:30.280]  It was like, punch the monkey and you might win a prize.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.840]  This is, I mean, if you're too young
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.220]  or your memory's too bad and you don't remember it,
[41:34.220 --> 41:36.820]  there were these ads that were at the top of web pages
[41:36.820 --> 41:37.660]  that like hotwired.
[41:37.660 --> 41:39.400]  It was literally punch the monkey.
[41:39.400 --> 41:40.240]  Right.
[41:41.160 --> 41:42.000]  And.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.340]  Like, honestly, we're not obfuscating anything.
[41:44.340 --> 41:45.720]  That's what the ad was.
[41:45.720 --> 41:48.780]  Right, and so the gimmick was it was a horizontal,
[41:48.780 --> 41:50.740]  like think of like a little ruler
[41:50.740 --> 41:52.320]  going across the top of the page,
[41:52.320 --> 41:55.460]  like maybe an inch high and four inches across.
[41:55.460 --> 41:58.560]  And there was a little anime, a cartoon monkey
[41:58.560 --> 42:01.040]  who animated from one side to the other.
[42:01.040 --> 42:04.880]  And the idea was you'd, if you could punch him,
[42:04.880 --> 42:07.220]  you know, your cursor would turn into a boxing glove.
[42:07.220 --> 42:09.320]  And if you could click right on the monkey's face,
[42:09.320 --> 42:11.920]  you might win a prize.
[42:11.920 --> 42:15.100]  And it was so funny because as a web developer,
[42:15.100 --> 42:16.880]  I was like, I don't think that's possible.
[42:16.880 --> 42:18.240]  And in like the late 90s,
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.360]  I'd still think it actually wasn't, you know,
[42:20.360 --> 42:22.400]  certainly not without Flash or something like that.
[42:22.400 --> 42:25.380]  It wasn't really possible with just JavaScript
[42:25.380 --> 42:27.800]  and animated GIFs.
[42:27.800 --> 42:31.760]  Certainly HTML didn't make anything programmatic possible.
[42:31.760 --> 42:33.680]  And then you'd like view source and look at it.
[42:33.680 --> 42:35.040]  It was just an animated GIF.
[42:35.040 --> 42:37.080]  And it was like, you didn't have to actually
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.660]  punch the monkey, you just had to click the ad.
[42:39.660 --> 42:41.600]  And it's like, oh, duh, that's the whole point,
[42:41.600 --> 42:43.320]  make you click the ad.
[42:43.320 --> 42:44.880]  Because it didn't seem very hard.
[42:44.880 --> 42:45.920]  Very famous ad.
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.700]  And we all thought, oh boy, ads on the web stink.
[42:49.700 --> 42:51.780]  Little did we know that they would
[42:51.780 --> 42:54.020]  make our fans turn on eventually.
[42:54.020 --> 42:57.000]  Well, so this is very interesting though,
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.980]  because I actually have an example of this ad
[42:59.980 --> 43:02.560]  on an article I wrote last year about Spotify
[43:02.560 --> 43:04.960]  and their sort of goals in podcasting.
[43:04.960 --> 43:07.800]  And the text of the ad is punch the monkey
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.560]  and win a free iPod.
[43:09.560 --> 43:12.880]  And the thing was, but no, they actually weren't lies.
[43:12.880 --> 43:15.000]  You really could get free iPods.
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.160]  And you like, you had to like sign up for,
[43:17.160 --> 43:18.720]  like you would go to these pages
[43:18.720 --> 43:20.880]  and it would have lists of all these things you had to do.
[43:20.880 --> 43:22.880]  You had to apply for several credit cards.
[43:22.880 --> 43:24.760]  You had to apply for a Netflix account.
[43:24.760 --> 43:26.920]  This is an underappreciated and unknown thing
[43:26.920 --> 43:28.280]  about Netflix's growth.
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.040]  Netflix was all over these affiliate marketing schemes.
[43:31.040 --> 43:33.860]  Like that's how they juiced a lot of their early growth,
[43:33.860 --> 43:35.840]  particularly back in the DVD days.
[43:35.840 --> 43:37.780]  There was like subscription video courses,
[43:37.780 --> 43:39.680]  or you sign up, you download sort of stuff.
[43:39.680 --> 43:41.040]  All these sorts of stuff.
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.240]  And all these products had huge lifetime values.
[43:45.240 --> 43:46.400]  Think about Netflix, right?
[43:46.400 --> 43:48.280]  The idea for Netflix is you're paying them
[43:48.280 --> 43:50.480]  X amount a month, basically forever.
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.760]  And if they can get you signed up and into their system,
[43:54.760 --> 43:56.120]  it's worth a lot.
[43:56.120 --> 43:59.640]  It's worth so much that it actually became viable
[43:59.640 --> 44:01.520]  to give people free iPods
[44:01.520 --> 44:03.620]  if they were willing to jump through all these hoops,
[44:03.620 --> 44:06.400]  because some number of those people would stick around
[44:06.400 --> 44:07.760]  to the extent that would more than pay
[44:07.760 --> 44:09.600]  for that sort of thing.
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.120]  And so what's funny is that's actually
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.360]  what podcast advertising kind of is today, right?
[44:16.360 --> 44:18.560]  You sign up, you put in a code,
[44:18.560 --> 44:21.280]  or you use a special URL or something along those lines.
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.600]  And that's kind of a pain in the rear end,
[44:23.600 --> 44:24.480]  because you have to figure out,
[44:24.480 --> 44:27.120]  oh, did the host read the ad correctly?
[44:27.120 --> 44:28.160]  We have to have tracking.
[44:28.160 --> 44:29.560]  We have to see how many people signed up.
[44:29.560 --> 44:32.560]  We have to compare that to our baseline, et cetera, et cetera.
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.520]  But it's worth it for like Linode.
[44:34.520 --> 44:37.520]  You mentioned in your ad a $5 a month plan, right?
[44:37.520 --> 44:38.600]  Sounds super cheap.
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.120]  Well, $5 a month for a year is $60 a month.
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.060]  You put a little website up there
[44:43.060 --> 44:44.940]  that you feel like you should maintain forever.
[44:44.940 --> 44:47.800]  Suddenly 10 years later, you've paid Linode $600.
[44:47.800 --> 44:49.440]  And that's worth a lot.
[44:49.440 --> 44:51.840]  That's worth the hassle of going through to sign up.
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.520]  Or Squarespace comes with a free domain name.
[44:55.520 --> 44:56.340]  Well, guess what?
[44:56.340 --> 44:58.920]  Once you have a domain name, you feel attached to that.
[44:58.920 --> 45:00.560]  You feel like you have to keep paying for it.
[45:00.560 --> 45:03.020]  And Squarespace ends up harvesting money from you
[45:03.020 --> 45:04.720]  for a very, very, very long time.
[45:04.720 --> 45:06.400]  The problem though,
[45:06.400 --> 45:07.240]  this is a problem for the web.
[45:07.240 --> 45:10.200]  You're really selling these spots on today's show, Ben.
[45:10.200 --> 45:12.500]  Sorry, is Squarespace coming out?
[45:12.500 --> 45:14.180]  Yeah, of course they are.
[45:14.180 --> 45:19.180]  I mean, sorry, it's your answer.
[45:21.700 --> 45:22.660]  No, it's all right.
[45:22.660 --> 45:23.740]  You know what, everybody knows.
[45:23.740 --> 45:25.340]  I think listeners of this show know enough
[45:25.340 --> 45:27.260]  to multiply whatever a monthly price is
[45:27.260 --> 45:29.340]  by 12 to get a yearly in.
[45:29.340 --> 45:31.340]  Oh, I own like 40 domain names.
[45:31.340 --> 45:32.300]  No, you're making a good point.
[45:32.300 --> 45:33.140]  You're making a good point.
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.540]  I own like 40 domain names.
[45:34.540 --> 45:38.220]  And it's very annoying because my domain registrar,
[45:38.220 --> 45:40.780]  it's on like the main page.
[45:40.780 --> 45:42.820]  It's a terrible, like these people need help
[45:42.820 --> 45:45.180]  in their marketing schemes
[45:45.180 --> 45:47.820]  because it shows you your annual spend.
[45:47.820 --> 45:49.040]  And it's very disturbing.
[45:49.040 --> 45:52.660]  Every time I walk in, I spend like over a thousand dollars
[45:52.660 --> 45:54.700]  every year to maintain all these domain names
[45:54.700 --> 45:56.540]  that I might or might not use in the future.
[45:56.540 --> 45:58.580]  It's terrible.
[45:58.580 --> 46:01.260]  But that's why it's a great business.
[46:01.260 --> 46:04.500]  And that's why they advertise on,
[46:04.500 --> 46:06.980]  they go to the hassle of advertising on podcasts
[46:06.980 --> 46:09.340]  because advertising on podcasts is difficult.
[46:09.340 --> 46:12.460]  Whereas advertising, and so this is the same day on the web,
[46:12.460 --> 46:15.580]  the problem though is there aren't that many companies
[46:15.580 --> 46:18.340]  that have business models that make sense for this, right?
[46:18.340 --> 46:20.780]  So you, again, credit cards, Netflix accounts, sure,
[46:20.780 --> 46:22.340]  made sense for the early web,
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.120]  but then you had lots of other companies
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.140]  that ought to advertise,
[46:28.140 --> 46:29.580]  or you would think want to advertise,
[46:29.580 --> 46:32.380]  but never did because it was too, it didn't make sense.
[46:32.380 --> 46:35.340]  And so Mary Meeker used to make those charts every year
[46:35.340 --> 46:37.980]  about, and one of the charts that she would always have
[46:37.980 --> 46:40.180]  was usage versus monetization,
[46:40.180 --> 46:43.140]  or like US media usage to ad spending ratios.
[46:43.140 --> 46:45.780]  And what happened again and again and again
[46:45.780 --> 46:47.020]  is the internet would say,
[46:47.020 --> 46:50.260]  well, the internet has all this time spent,
[46:50.260 --> 46:53.300]  but the internet share of advertising is super small.
[46:53.300 --> 46:54.940]  And everyone couldn't figure out like,
[46:54.940 --> 46:55.860]  oh, maybe just the internet
[46:55.860 --> 46:58.120]  is never gonna work for advertising.
[46:58.120 --> 46:59.040]  What happened was,
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.260]  was no one was doing the right kind of advertising.
[47:01.260 --> 47:03.960]  And so, because they're doing these sorts of things,
[47:03.960 --> 47:06.140]  and once it was figured out
[47:06.140 --> 47:08.420]  that you could do targeted customized advertising,
[47:08.420 --> 47:10.960]  boom, that window closed very, very, very quickly.
[47:13.460 --> 47:15.660]  Sorry, that was a monologue.
[47:15.660 --> 47:16.740]  No, but it's good though.
[47:16.740 --> 47:18.540]  It's on point.
[47:19.820 --> 47:20.860]  Well, that's the thing with podcasts though,
[47:20.860 --> 47:23.780]  is like there's, Spotify sees this window.
[47:23.780 --> 47:26.940]  They see there's all this time spent on podcasting.
[47:26.940 --> 47:29.820]  The level of monetization is very small
[47:29.820 --> 47:31.460]  relative to the time spent.
[47:31.460 --> 47:34.900]  So there's an opportunity to close that window,
[47:34.900 --> 47:38.320]  just like Facebook and Google close the window on the web.
[47:40.220 --> 47:45.020]  But as a user, the thing that is so striking
[47:45.020 --> 47:50.020]  is that podcasts have been around now for quite a while.
[47:50.620 --> 47:52.780]  It's funny, I don't know if you saw it,
[47:52.780 --> 47:54.700]  but there's a Slack you and I are both on,
[47:54.700 --> 47:57.740]  and I dug up, the question came up
[47:57.740 --> 48:00.300]  as to where the calling our friend of the show,
[48:00.300 --> 48:03.700]  Craig Hockenberry, talking about his giant fleshy palms
[48:03.700 --> 48:05.540]  and his humongous hands
[48:05.540 --> 48:08.000]  and how he would attack somebody in a fight.
[48:09.380 --> 48:11.460]  And everybody knew vaguely that it came up
[48:11.460 --> 48:13.700]  at some point on the original run of the talk show
[48:13.700 --> 48:14.980]  that I did with Dan Benjamin,
[48:14.980 --> 48:16.660]  but when exactly nobody knew.
[48:16.660 --> 48:19.980]  And I figured out the easiest way to figure out
[48:19.980 --> 48:23.540]  when it was was I asked David underscore Smith,
[48:23.540 --> 48:25.760]  who has both an encyclopedic memory
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.760]  and has like programmatically generated transcripts
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.100]  of a bunch of shows, and we figured it out.
[48:34.100 --> 48:35.640]  It was an episode from,
[48:35.640 --> 48:37.140]  it was almost exactly around this time of year.
[48:37.140 --> 48:40.380]  It was like late March or early, mid-March 2008.
[48:40.380 --> 48:42.800]  So I was podcasting 12 years ago.
[48:44.100 --> 48:44.940]  And it was funny,
[48:44.940 --> 48:47.700]  because we were talking about Dan and I at that episode.
[48:47.700 --> 48:49.120]  We didn't even have sponsors back then.
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.720]  We'd thought about it, we tried to get it,
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.180]  but it was like so foreign 12 years ago
[48:53.180 --> 48:55.160]  that there would be sponsors on a podcast
[48:55.160 --> 48:56.960]  that we didn't have sponsors on the podcast,
[48:56.960 --> 48:59.580]  and we were joking that the Icon Factory
[48:59.580 --> 49:04.580]  should sponsor the show to promote Twitterrific for iPhone,
[49:04.780 --> 49:06.260]  which was brand new at the time,
[49:06.260 --> 49:09.100]  because 2008 was when the App Store opened up.
[49:10.300 --> 49:12.320]  I think in March it was like coming.
[49:12.320 --> 49:14.700]  Yeah, I think that Apple had announced the SDK
[49:14.700 --> 49:16.980]  and it would be coming in a couple months.
[49:18.820 --> 49:21.780]  So in some ways that seems like a long time ago.
[49:21.780 --> 49:25.620]  In some ways it seems like forever ago.
[49:25.620 --> 49:26.760]  In some ways it feels like,
[49:26.760 --> 49:28.700]  well, but podcasting is still podcasting
[49:28.700 --> 49:31.020]  and it's just like the idea that you could monetize it
[49:31.020 --> 49:32.820]  through sponsorships just sort of came up.
[49:32.820 --> 49:36.700]  And whether they're big shows or smaller shows,
[49:36.700 --> 49:37.940]  they're more or less the same
[49:37.940 --> 49:40.500]  and nothing's been wrecked, right?
[49:40.500 --> 49:44.420]  That's the thing, is that it doesn't feel like...
[49:45.820 --> 49:50.820]  And the web is so hostile as a reader sometimes.
[49:53.800 --> 49:54.980]  Somebody says, read this article
[49:54.980 --> 49:55.980]  and you go to read the article
[49:55.980 --> 49:59.340]  and a thing pops up literally covering the article
[49:59.340 --> 50:01.780]  that says, do you want to subscribe to our newsletter
[50:01.780 --> 50:03.220]  or do you want to turn off,
[50:03.220 --> 50:05.460]  please consider turning off your ad blocker
[50:05.460 --> 50:07.080]  and you have to click this and click that
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.980]  just to read the thing that you got.
[50:08.980 --> 50:13.260]  And however much annoyed people were by print advertising
[50:13.260 --> 50:15.980]  ever, they never put ads over the article
[50:15.980 --> 50:18.020]  because it wasn't even possible to put an ad.
[50:18.020 --> 50:20.580]  How could you put an ad over the article in print?
[50:20.580 --> 50:21.540]  It couldn't happen.
[50:21.540 --> 50:23.620]  And it certainly wouldn't pop up
[50:23.620 --> 50:26.740]  while you were 100 words into the article,
[50:26.740 --> 50:28.220]  which is what some things do now.
[50:28.220 --> 50:32.140]  You start scrolling and then they pop up the stupid thing.
[50:32.140 --> 50:32.980]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[50:32.980 --> 50:35.440]  There's nothing like that in podcasting.
[50:35.440 --> 50:36.780]  I mean, maybe I say nothing
[50:36.780 --> 50:38.820]  and I'm sure there's people who are working on it
[50:38.820 --> 50:40.480]  and maybe you can find it in certain corners,
[50:40.480 --> 50:41.580]  but most of the...
[50:41.580 --> 50:45.700]  Using podcast apps like Apple Podcasts
[50:45.700 --> 50:49.340]  and Overcast and Castro and all the popular ones
[50:49.340 --> 50:52.160]  and listening to popular open podcasts
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.060]  where you just subscribe to an RSS feed
[50:54.060 --> 50:55.820]  and you can just type the name of the show
[50:55.820 --> 50:58.020]  and the podcast client gets it
[50:58.020 --> 50:59.740]  by searching the iTunes directory,
[50:59.740 --> 51:03.980]  which Apple is very generously made open to anybody to use.
[51:03.980 --> 51:06.320]  And then you get it and you type Joe Rogan
[51:06.320 --> 51:07.780]  and there's the Joe Rogan show
[51:07.780 --> 51:10.060]  and then you hit play and you just start listening.
[51:10.060 --> 51:12.200]  And there might be sponsorships,
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.860]  but they're not the equivalent of web pop-ups
[51:16.860 --> 51:19.460]  that keep you from reading it, you know?
[51:19.460 --> 51:22.460]  Yeah, but here's something that is maybe a defense
[51:22.460 --> 51:26.060]  of Spotify and what they're trying to do with this.
[51:26.060 --> 51:28.060]  The ads on...
[51:28.060 --> 51:30.780]  You're talking about ads in web pages and browsers
[51:30.780 --> 51:33.620]  and those ads sort of arise out of desperation
[51:33.620 --> 51:36.500]  to an extent where everyone's competing.
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.060]  The whole problem with the internet,
[51:38.060 --> 51:40.260]  as far from a business proposition goes,
[51:40.260 --> 51:42.820]  is that you're competing with every other web page
[51:42.820 --> 51:44.420]  on the internet at all times, right?
[51:44.420 --> 51:47.460]  You don't have any sort of geographic advantage
[51:47.460 --> 51:50.140]  or some sort of, you know, because you can access a server
[51:50.140 --> 51:53.380]  in the US or access a server in Europe or in Asia,
[51:53.380 --> 51:56.420]  just as easy for all intents and purposes as any other one.
[51:56.420 --> 51:58.380]  And that's great if you're small like me
[51:58.380 --> 51:59.220]  and you want to, like,
[51:59.220 --> 52:01.540]  I have as much reach as the New York Times.
[52:01.540 --> 52:03.220]  Why? Because we're both on the internet.
[52:03.220 --> 52:05.900]  So we actually have identical reach, right?
[52:05.900 --> 52:08.580]  But that makes it very, very hard to monetize
[52:08.580 --> 52:10.660]  because advertisers could go anywhere.
[52:10.660 --> 52:13.660]  And the whole thing with ad tech is that, you know,
[52:13.660 --> 52:15.100]  it follows you around the internet
[52:15.100 --> 52:17.900]  and, you know, with all the pluses and minuses
[52:17.900 --> 52:20.820]  that that entails, probably mostly minuses.
[52:20.820 --> 52:24.700]  But on the other hand, advertising on Facebook
[52:24.700 --> 52:27.820]  and advertising on Instagram doesn't have that experience.
[52:27.820 --> 52:29.500]  There's no performance penalty
[52:29.500 --> 52:31.260]  to ads on Facebook and Instagram.
[52:31.260 --> 52:33.180]  They're highly, highly optimized
[52:33.180 --> 52:34.660]  to make sure they load well and quickly
[52:34.660 --> 52:36.020]  and don't interfere with your session.
[52:36.020 --> 52:38.940]  There's often, like, the amount of stuff I buy on Instagram
[52:38.940 --> 52:40.860]  is kind of ridiculous,
[52:40.860 --> 52:42.780]  but there's always like cool little things.
[52:42.780 --> 52:44.260]  It's like, oh, like I got a pencil case
[52:44.260 --> 52:45.100]  from my daughter the other day,
[52:45.100 --> 52:47.540]  because she liked what, into art and all that sort of stuff.
[52:47.540 --> 52:49.060]  And it was a very clever design.
[52:49.060 --> 52:50.140]  I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[52:50.140 --> 52:52.620]  And why?
[52:52.620 --> 52:57.060]  Because it's sort of built in as a first-class citizen
[52:57.060 --> 52:59.140]  in a way that fits the format, right?
[52:59.140 --> 53:01.420]  It fits the, if it's in the feed,
[53:01.420 --> 53:03.700]  it's similar to the content around it.
[53:03.700 --> 53:06.500]  And that is what Spotify is trying to do.
[53:06.500 --> 53:09.060]  They're trying to build a system
[53:09.060 --> 53:11.020]  that's sort of fully integrated
[53:11.020 --> 53:13.340]  because the thing with Spotify, like, you know,
[53:13.340 --> 53:15.500]  why is, Spotify doesn't download MP3s.
[53:15.500 --> 53:17.500]  Why do you have to go to Spotify as a podcaster
[53:17.500 --> 53:18.340]  and sign up?
[53:18.340 --> 53:21.060]  Because they ingest your MP3
[53:21.060 --> 53:23.260]  and into their streaming infrastructure
[53:23.260 --> 53:24.900]  and everything is streamed.
[53:24.900 --> 53:26.340]  Well, everything is streamed,
[53:26.340 --> 53:29.060]  then inserting ads that are streamed and dynamic
[53:29.060 --> 53:31.740]  becomes a much more approachable problem
[53:31.740 --> 53:33.340]  than trying to stick it dynamically
[53:33.340 --> 53:34.580]  into an MP3 or something.
[53:34.580 --> 53:38.060]  So right now the ugliest advertising in podcasting
[53:38.060 --> 53:40.500]  are these dynamically inserted ads on download.
[53:40.500 --> 53:42.380]  They don't fit the podcast at all.
[53:42.380 --> 53:43.420]  It's awkward.
[53:43.420 --> 53:45.420]  There's this weird kind of pseudo targeting
[53:45.420 --> 53:47.300]  based on like your IP address,
[53:47.300 --> 53:49.980]  but that's actually the worst.
[53:49.980 --> 53:52.220]  I mean, the podcast we most listen to,
[53:52.220 --> 53:55.100]  it's all host read and it feels very, you know,
[53:55.100 --> 53:56.740]  like that's, people like it
[53:56.740 --> 53:58.340]  because it feels friendly, et cetera, et cetera.
[53:58.340 --> 53:59.220]  And yeah, you can skip through it,
[53:59.220 --> 54:00.260]  but if you listen to it,
[54:00.260 --> 54:01.660]  it's not the worst thing in the world.
[54:01.660 --> 54:03.140]  But, and then on the other hand,
[54:03.140 --> 54:05.100]  you can envision a Spotify world
[54:05.100 --> 54:06.780]  where things are much smoother
[54:06.780 --> 54:09.300]  and just tied together in a much more cogent way.
[54:09.300 --> 54:11.820]  But there is this messy middle world
[54:11.820 --> 54:14.420]  that is actually the better analogy, I think,
[54:14.420 --> 54:16.180]  to advertising on the web.
[54:16.180 --> 54:17.020]  Hmm.
[54:18.020 --> 54:19.780]  Well, anyway, Joe Rogan is...
[54:19.780 --> 54:21.980]  And just one more point on this.
[54:21.980 --> 54:23.620]  No, because I think it's really interesting
[54:23.620 --> 54:26.460]  because I've been very oppositional to Spotify,
[54:26.460 --> 54:28.300]  but the reason I'm oppositional to Spotify
[54:28.300 --> 54:31.140]  is because they don't support openness at all.
[54:31.140 --> 54:33.260]  So like the, so you, for example,
[54:33.260 --> 54:35.180]  Dithering, our new podcast, is open.
[54:35.180 --> 54:36.500]  It's not free.
[54:36.500 --> 54:38.220]  You have to pay to get a feed,
[54:38.220 --> 54:40.700]  but that feed can go into any podcast app.
[54:40.700 --> 54:42.180]  You can add it to Apple Podcasts,
[54:42.180 --> 54:43.460]  you can add it to Overcast,
[54:43.460 --> 54:44.620]  you can add it to PocketCasts,
[54:44.620 --> 54:45.660]  you can add it to iTunes,
[54:45.660 --> 54:48.900]  like whatever, you could put the feed in your browser
[54:48.900 --> 54:51.580]  and look at the feed and see exactly what the enclosures are,
[54:51.580 --> 54:54.580]  where the MP3s come from, et cetera, et cetera.
[54:54.580 --> 54:57.020]  Obviously, it's like email,
[54:57.020 --> 54:58.020]  which I have experience with.
[54:58.020 --> 55:01.620]  I sell email and now I sell open sort of RSS feeds.
[55:01.620 --> 55:03.380]  It's the same sort of concept,
[55:03.380 --> 55:04.380]  but it's not free
[55:04.380 --> 55:05.860]  because you have to get your own customized one.
[55:05.860 --> 55:09.260]  Spotify, the Joe Rogan podcast, is going to be free,
[55:09.260 --> 55:13.220]  but there's no mechanism to put in an arbitrary RSS feed,
[55:13.220 --> 55:17.020]  which means that Spotify is not just building the system,
[55:17.020 --> 55:20.060]  they're also shutting off every other possible means
[55:20.060 --> 55:22.100]  to sort of monetize and build a podcast.
[55:22.100 --> 55:25.540]  And that's what bothers me as a publisher,
[55:25.540 --> 55:28.900]  even though as an analyst, I appreciate what they're doing.
[55:28.900 --> 55:30.140]  I think there's a big opportunity here.
[55:30.140 --> 55:31.500]  I think it's smart by them.
[55:31.500 --> 55:34.100]  And as a sort of podcaster,
[55:34.100 --> 55:35.580]  I actually think there's potential here.
[55:35.580 --> 55:40.580]  There's potential for Spotify to build a Facebook,
[55:41.180 --> 55:43.100]  in the positive parts of Facebook,
[55:43.100 --> 55:47.140]  a pleasant experience that monetizes way better
[55:47.140 --> 55:49.220]  than what we have currently.
[55:50.340 --> 55:52.900]  Well, but then I look at the way that,
[55:54.420 --> 55:57.500]  podcasting is the exception to that regard, right?
[55:57.500 --> 56:00.260]  Like stuff that you see as you scroll
[56:00.260 --> 56:02.500]  has been dominated by Facebook
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.740]  and Instagram is part of Facebook.
[56:04.740 --> 56:08.900]  And the entirety of Instagram's monetization strategy
[56:08.900 --> 56:11.380]  occurred post-acquisition, right?
[56:11.380 --> 56:14.900]  I don't think Instagram had any kind of ads at all
[56:14.900 --> 56:16.940]  before Facebook acquired them.
[56:16.940 --> 56:17.980]  Yeah, that was the reason why Facebook
[56:17.980 --> 56:19.660]  got regulatory approval,
[56:19.660 --> 56:23.380]  because it wasn't perceived as being competitive
[56:23.380 --> 56:25.100]  because they weren't monetizing,
[56:25.100 --> 56:28.020]  which is kind of amazing in retrospect, but.
[56:28.020 --> 56:29.660]  Really, really?
[56:29.660 --> 56:30.820]  No, this is a perfect example
[56:30.820 --> 56:33.220]  of not understanding the internet.
[56:33.220 --> 56:36.620]  Instagram was clearly a social network, it's very visual.
[56:36.620 --> 56:39.020]  How else on earth would they ever monetize?
[56:39.020 --> 56:40.740]  Of course it's gonna be advertising.
[56:40.740 --> 56:41.580]  Right.
[56:41.580 --> 56:43.940]  And there's other ways they could have done it,
[56:43.940 --> 56:47.900]  and like you said, they worked out a way to do native ads
[56:47.900 --> 56:51.900]  that certainly haven't kept people
[56:51.900 --> 56:53.940]  from using Instagram in the aggregate.
[56:57.460 --> 56:59.460]  But there's other ways they could have done it.
[56:59.460 --> 57:02.660]  But the fact that they could do it at all was,
[57:02.660 --> 57:05.820]  it just was sort of really ignorant to pretend like,
[57:05.820 --> 57:07.420]  well, but their revenue is zero,
[57:07.420 --> 57:10.980]  so they're just losing money, so there's no problem.
[57:13.540 --> 57:18.540]  But I look at video and there's just no equivalent to,
[57:20.460 --> 57:23.780]  there never really was an equivalent
[57:23.780 --> 57:26.420]  to podcasting for video, right?
[57:26.420 --> 57:30.180]  Like it's just a very strange difference,
[57:30.180 --> 57:35.180]  because okay, video is by size,
[57:35.260 --> 57:39.220]  like a video file is a lot bigger than an audio file.
[57:39.220 --> 57:40.620]  But we've reached the point
[57:40.620 --> 57:42.500]  where people have internet access now,
[57:42.500 --> 57:46.300]  where I guess hosting still would be a concern
[57:46.300 --> 57:50.140]  if you were just gonna host video on your own server,
[57:50.140 --> 57:52.180]  your bandwidth would still be a concern.
[57:52.180 --> 57:56.580]  But it's one of those areas where hosting my own website
[57:56.580 --> 57:59.620]  just isn't a thing that I don't think about it anymore.
[57:59.620 --> 58:04.180]  Like even Daring Fireball, which doesn't have many images,
[58:04.180 --> 58:07.620]  has almost no video in the history of the site,
[58:07.620 --> 58:11.060]  relative to most sites, very, very low bandwidth.
[58:12.780 --> 58:16.180]  In the earlier years of Daring Fireball,
[58:16.180 --> 58:19.020]  as it grew in popularity,
[58:19.020 --> 58:22.220]  the amount of bandwidth I was using a month
[58:22.220 --> 58:24.540]  was something I had to keep an eye on.
[58:24.540 --> 58:27.340]  And slowly but surely over time
[58:27.340 --> 58:29.580]  I had to up my hosting plans
[58:29.580 --> 58:32.940]  and move to higher level plans.
[58:32.940 --> 58:36.940]  And it was never, in terms of business costs,
[58:36.940 --> 58:38.220]  a significant factor.
[58:38.220 --> 58:41.820]  Like my accountant was always just stunned
[58:41.820 --> 58:46.140]  at the level of my hosting costs to the revenue.
[58:46.140 --> 58:48.660]  He was like, this is an unbelievable business.
[58:48.660 --> 58:50.540]  Because my accountant isn't coming
[58:50.540 --> 58:52.980]  from the world of internet,
[58:52.980 --> 58:57.540]  he's coming from the real world.
[58:57.540 --> 59:01.140]  But bandwidth was a concern just 15, 20 years ago
[59:01.140 --> 59:02.500]  for a site like Daring Fireball.
[59:02.500 --> 59:04.700]  So obviously video is bigger than that.
[59:04.700 --> 59:09.060]  But it's not that different from audio in my mind,
[59:09.060 --> 59:11.700]  but yet the way that the two media ecosystems
[59:11.700 --> 59:14.980]  on the internet have evolved couldn't be more opposite.
[59:14.980 --> 59:17.700]  Where we're at this point now in 2020,
[59:17.700 --> 59:21.260]  we're only beginning to talk about Spotify as a company
[59:21.260 --> 59:26.260]  that might be building a monster walled garden
[59:28.020 --> 59:30.820]  of exclusive content.
[59:30.820 --> 59:32.260]  I mean, and I say audio
[59:32.260 --> 59:33.980]  and I'm talking about spoken word audio
[59:33.980 --> 59:36.460]  because obviously music is something
[59:36.460 --> 59:38.340]  that's entirely different.
[59:39.500 --> 59:40.820]  And I guess it's not a surprise
[59:40.820 --> 59:42.820]  that somebody like Spotify is evolving
[59:42.820 --> 59:46.380]  into the world of spoken world stuff coming from music
[59:46.380 --> 59:48.940]  where that's how they built up the massive hundreds,
[59:48.940 --> 59:51.580]  literally hundreds of millions of users.
[59:51.580 --> 59:52.900]  Whereas video never had that.
[59:52.900 --> 59:56.500]  There was never really in a popular open video world
[59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.100]  and there's stuff for professional quote unquote,
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:05.660]  TV shows, TV style shows and movies like Netflix
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:10.660]  and Apple TV Plus now and HBO and others, Hulu, et cetera.
[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.260]  And of course, YouTube, right?
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:17.940]  YouTube for, which is the closer equivalent
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.980]  to podcasting in terms of supporting independence, right?
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.100]  Like people in our sphere.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.500]  I mean, somebody like Rene Ritchie,
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.420]  who's always on the show is now,
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.460]  that's his, now that he left iMore,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.580]  his primary gig is his YouTube channel.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.020]  That goes through YouTube and that is so different
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.580]  from the mindset of being an independent media producer
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.860]  from podcasting.
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.700]  And I was reading today, you and I started talking
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.740]  about Joe Rogan in this movie yesterday.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.540]  And I know that he had a big YouTube presence too.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.020]  You mentioned it just a bit ago that this is,
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.900]  it's a factor in the success of his show.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:06.020]  But I also read today that he's had an enormous amount
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.820]  of problems with YouTube quote unquote,
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.100]  demonetizing him et cetera over the years,
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.620]  I guess based on arguments over the content of the show.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.300]  Yeah, one of the things about his show
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.100]  is he will basically interview anyone and everyone.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:27.100]  And he's sort of all the way on the extreme of the,
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.780]  I might disagree with you,
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.460]  but I'm gonna give you a right to talk
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.420]  and that goes on his show.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.420]  So he's had, I think like Alex Jones
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.420]  on his podcast before.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.780]  So just to take like an extreme example.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.780]  Of somebody who's clearly controversial,
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.660]  whatever you think of Alex Jones.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.980]  That's right, that's right.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.620]  So that's an issue for him.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.460]  And one of the reasons that pushed him away from YouTube,
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.060]  cause I think he's been talking about that a lot,
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.420]  but there's actually a few really interesting points
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.780]  in what you just talked about.
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.340]  You mentioned the, well, yeah, it's different bandwidth,
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.060]  but I think there's a certain sort of like,
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:06.180]  there's a tech mindset, which I think we would both share,
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.180]  which at the end of the day, it's all ones and zeros, right?
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.220]  Text and audio and video.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.860]  It's all just going over the same pipes as it were
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.780]  in the same format, right?
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.980]  And the truth though, is I actually think
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:23.980]  that the cost of bandwidth has fundamentally shaped
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.300]  the fact that text and audio and video
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.620]  are totally different.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.780]  I actually think that is all that matters.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.260]  Because it just wasn't, you know,
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.660]  you think about go back to when Napster sort of blew up
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.660]  in, you know, 1999, I believe it was, or 1998, 99.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.060]  And it was on the edge of sort of possible,
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.140]  if you were on a dial-up, which most people were,
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.900]  it would take like an hour to download a song.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.940]  We were on the university broadband network,
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.460]  so it was like amazing, but even then compared to today,
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.700]  it still took forever, but there was no way,
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.540]  there were some people that were sharing video
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.140]  even at that time, you know, via, you know,
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.940]  you'd have these crazy sketchy sites
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.300]  and you'd do like FTP logins to like other people's
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.300]  computers across the internet, it was insane.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:09.980]  And like you were downloading like a movie,
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.260]  it would come across as like 50 different files,
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.780]  you know, that were split up and numbered
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.500]  and then you'd have software on your computer
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.180]  to put them all back together.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.360]  But it was because the downloads were so unreliable
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.300]  and so slow that you couldn't possibly risk
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.980]  having one file of the whole thing because, you know,
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.820]  you might get 90% of the way there.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.660]  You get 90% through, yep.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.540]  And then, you know, somebody would pick up the phone.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.020]  And not just that, but you would download it
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.940]  for like a week and then you would play it
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.300]  and it was like post-it stamp size because it was,
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.280]  so like the size of video is so astronomically larger
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.280]  that I think that's why it never became sort of user,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.540]  you know, peer-to-peer sort of thing.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.720]  It's always been centralized services.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.340]  Yes, you can host your own video, but you, like,
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.340]  in today, it's actually more viable because of widespread
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.100]  CDNs and things on those lines.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.700]  But it's already too late because YouTube is dominant,
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.620]  and you're just gonna use YouTube.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:09.880]  Or, you know, so professionally speaking, Napster,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.320]  or not Napster, Netflix is sort of, you know,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.740]  was early to this and established a very dominant position.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.560]  Whereas audio files, because they were small enough,
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.580]  they sort of, you started out with a peer-to-peer thing
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.860]  and with everyone having a bunch of MP3s.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.020]  And so Spotify came in in a very different position
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.020]  in the market because instead of competing against nothing,
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.420]  like YouTube was or Netflix was,
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.180]  it was competing against piracy.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:42.660]  And so that shaped how the service was created and formed.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.940]  And the same thing, and so that's number one,
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.300]  that's different, but then number two,
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.220]  with podcasts in particular, you know, podcasts started,
[01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:53.140]  Apple launched the podcast Support in 2005 or something,
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.740]  I think like that.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.880]  I mean, the name podcast didn't even exist until 2004.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.660]  I think, you know, Dave Weiner, I produced something
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.720]  along the lines of late 90s.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.980]  But you'll say mid 2000s, somewhere around then.
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.180]  What's interesting is that's the same time
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.000]  that YouTube started.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.020]  YouTube was in 2006, I think.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:12.020]  And the difference though is YouTube grew up around YouTube
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.220]  and podcasts grew up around Apple and iTunes.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.620]  And the reason why I think nothing has happened in podcasts
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:22.380]  until the last couple of years is because Apple
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.620]  was the only obvious candidate to do something about it.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.700]  And they just continuously chose not to do anything.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.100]  And so that left it in sort of a state of stasis
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.980]  where if Apple had cared to lift a finger,
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.380]  they could have completely shaped and owned
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.560]  and dominated the entire market.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.580]  But by virtue of doing nothing, nothing happened.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.100]  And also no one else could do anything.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.740]  And this whole Joe Rubin thing fits into this
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.540]  because it's an attempt by Spotify to basically
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.340]  wrest control of the system away from Apple
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.380]  because without a centralized player,
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.260]  it's never going to evolve beyond what it is.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.500]  And Spotify is not that centralized player now
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.120]  and they're trying to become it.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.960]  All right, let's take a break.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.260]  We can pick this back up and thank our next sponsor.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.060]  Oh man, I love these guys.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.820]  I am enjoying their product right now, literally,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.360]  as we record the show.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.580]  Yes Please Coffee.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.360]  They spell it funny way.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.360]  Speaking of taking out some vowels, Y-E-S-P-L-Z.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.140]  Yes Please Coffee is the sponsor.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.180]  I want to tell you about.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.380]  I'm enjoying some of their coffee right now.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.560]  I just love it.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.700]  It's my favorite coffee.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.040]  It is delicious.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:37.880]  I would say this.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.940]  I would tell you to go buy Yes Please Coffee
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.520]  even if they weren't sponsoring the show.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.020]  What you do is you go to their site, yesplease.coffee.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.560]  What a great domain name, Y-E-S-P-L-Z.coffee.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.580]  You sign up, you get a subscription.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.300]  You tell them how often you want coffee.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.980]  You want it every week, every two weeks, every four weeks,
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.640]  whatever, how much do you want at a time,
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.140]  and then the coffee just starts showing up to your house
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.520]  as you go.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.280]  This is a great service right now for obvious reasons
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.260]  since we're not going out.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.060]  It's a great service in general, even in normal times.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.900]  I've been getting mail order coffee for years and years.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.980]  Actually, back in the day when it was called Tonks,
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:23.940]  well, guess what?
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:28.220]  Tonks, Tony Koneckny, founder of Tonks.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.740]  He's the Tonks and Tonks.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.660]  He's the founder of Yes Please Coffee,
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.740]  so he's actually back.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.060]  So if you remember back in the day
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.420]  when Tonks Coffee was sponsoring this show,
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.700]  well, now his new company, Yes Please,
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.180]  is sponsoring the show.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.580]  They're doing great.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.660]  They are holding up during the quarantine.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.500]  They're well-stocked.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.560]  They've got coffee.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.200]  Their small team and production is isolated.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.260]  They're staying safe as they pack up
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.500]  and ship your coffee every week.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.540]  U.S. Postal Service still going strong,
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.300]  so you can get world-class coffee.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.940]  Seriously, the best coffee I've ever had in the world
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.780]  delivered right to your door on a schedule you control.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.180]  That's Yes Please.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.040]  There's no hassle, no commitment.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.820]  If you just wanna try a bag, just see how good it is,
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.980]  you could just do that.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.520]  And they have a coupon, special coupon,
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.740]  just for readers of the show, Fireball 5.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:22.900]  Fireball 5 saves you five bucks off your first bag.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.700]  Try it, just try one bag of their coffee.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.180]  Here's the thing, too.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.820]  They make it, their website, once you subscribe,
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.820]  makes it so easy to manage your shipments.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.420]  I used to make coffee every morning
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.740]  and then I'd go out in the afternoon,
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.260]  get a second cup of coffee out and about.
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.980]  Well, I don't go out and about anymore.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.620]  I'm locked up, it's quarantine.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:47.340]  So I had to effectively more than double my delivery coffee.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.620]  Just like two clicks, two clicks, hit OK.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.900]  Now I have more coffee.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.540]  Things go back to normal a couple weeks from now,
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.420]  maybe months from now, who knows.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.060]  I wanna go back two clicks away
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.080]  from decreasing my subscription.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.900]  It's so super easy, no commitment,
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.420]  and it's seriously, seriously my favorite coffee
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.780]  in the world, I just love it.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.820]  I'm drinking it right now.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.580]  So go to Yes Please, Y-E-S-P-L-Z dot coffee,
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.040]  and then remember that code Fireball 5,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.300]  save five bucks off your first order.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.920]  My thanks to Yes Please.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.760]  Go get some.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:25.840]  And a great example where subscriptions are not a bad thing.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.680]  It's a win-win.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.700]  I mean, you know what you don't have.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.900]  You're not walking around Central City, Philadelphia
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.020]  with a bunch of boarded up shops trying to find coffee.
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.660]  No, you couldn't find coffee right now if you tried.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.740]  Joanna Stern was on the show a couple weeks ago.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.140]  She said that her neighborhood place
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.140]  is serving takeout coffee.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.180]  So I'm sure there's places in Philly you could get it.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.220]  None of my favorite places are open.
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.380]  I hope they're all doing okay.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.220]  I don't know, I mean, I hope all the people,
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.300]  the regular baristas I know are doing well.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.120]  I worry about them.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.100]  It's been a long time, but yeah.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.380]  Yeah, yes, please, I mean, again, they are a sponsor.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.380]  I mean, they're sponsoring the show,
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:02.040]  but it is absolutely a fantastic subscription service
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.140]  and a terrific product to have a subscription for.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:06.980]  And really.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.220]  And a great match for a podcast,
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.900]  because people like you, they care about your opinion.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.020]  You say this is actually great.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.380]  I'd recommend it regardless.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.720]  And then, at least in theory,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.060]  they're getting X number of dollars per you for a month
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.260]  for a very, very, very long time.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.100]  It's a win-win.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.860]  Well, and 100%, it's all based on their confidence.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.880]  Seriously, I mean, I've talked to Tonks about it.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.140]  They're just confident that if you like coffee
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.360]  and you try their coffee and you subscribe,
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.980]  the deal will keep subscribing
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.700]  because the coffee speaks for itself.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.780]  Here, listen, I can prove it.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.700]  This is the proof.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.740]  You can't fake this.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.220]  This is the proof right here.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.060]  Listen.
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.180]  That's me pouring.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.820]  That's the remainder of my nighttime pot of coffee here.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.100]  It's 1130 at night in Philadelphia.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.100]  I'm drinking coffee.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.980]  This is how we end up with dithering
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.580]  because usually in the morning,
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.320]  it's the evening West Coast time.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.780]  And so I'm busy talking to people, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.780]  And then it gets into sort of the noontime here,
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.620]  early afternoon, and everyone's sort of dropping off,
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.680]  going to bed, just being quiet.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.780]  I'm trying to do work.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.220]  And then, but not you.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.440]  You're always still awake.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.260]  I want to talk about dithering
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.540]  in the third segment of the show,
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.980]  but it is funny because last week we recorded,
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.780]  we recorded 10, 10 o'clock Eastern.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.840]  It actually works out beautifully.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.380]  We're 12 hours apart.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.620]  I forget, that's not true 365 days a year.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.980]  There's a part of the year.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.540]  There's no Daylight Savings Time here.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.140]  So then it becomes 13 hours.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:39.980]  You know what?
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.620]  Let's talk about Daylight Savings Time.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.920]  If we haven't angered everybody with Fahrenheit Celsius,
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.640]  I could get on this.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.140]  I love no daylight.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.580]  No, you guys are always Daylight Savings.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.420]  Isn't that the case?
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:51.880]  No, we're never Daylight Savings.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.800]  So I hate it.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.540]  It's bad because it gets dark too early.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.160]  Like who wants it to get dark early?
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.760]  These people that rage against Daylight Savings Time
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.940]  are out of their minds.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:02.180]  They're just complaining to complain.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.180]  They haven't thought about anything.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.860]  Yeah, and you know, every time I rail about,
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.700]  I'm with you.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.660]  I mean, I'm a night owl too,
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.440]  but I mean, there are times I have to get up early.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.300]  I know sometimes you have like a 6 a.m. flight
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.740]  or 5.30 flight or something.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.340]  You gotta get up, get to the airport.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.360]  Who cares if it's dark?
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.220]  It's early in the morning.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.460]  You feel miserable anyway.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.620]  It's like you're appreciating the light.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:29.160]  So anyway, Joe Rogan, Howard Stern is the,
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.620]  we thought about talking about it on Dithering.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.700]  We're like, no, let's save it.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.500]  Let's save it for the talk show.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.140]  Joe, Howard Stern does not identify as a podcaster.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.620]  And if anything, if you listen to him,
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:45.540]  he'll rail against the fact that he thinks podcasters
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.740]  are a bunch of hacks and they don't,
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.140]  he's sort of anti-podcast.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:56.980]  But semantics of what exactly is a podcaster or not,
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.400]  Howard Stern is effectively the proto-podcaster.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.540]  Yep, no, that's exactly it.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.820]  I've always made this point about Bill Simmons,
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.580]  who Bill Simmons never wrote a blog
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.940]  and he's, I've complained about bloggers,
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.340]  but he was the first blogger in spirit, right?
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.240]  Because it was the tone and the way in which,
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.340]  like the whole like fan perspective,
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.580]  I'm gonna put my allegiances out there
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:24.240]  and gonna write about it seemingly inane stuff,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.980]  but what people actually care about
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.060]  instead of this sort of like traditional calmness,
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.380]  voice from nowhere sort of approach.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.780]  It was the tone of a blogger,
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:35.700]  even though he was kind of before blogging
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.700]  became a thing, it led the way to blogging.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.580]  Once this sort of infrastructure got there,
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.700]  and I've always thought of Stern in a similar way, right?
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.380]  There's something about his show that feels podcasty,
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.220]  even though it absolutely came up on the radio,
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.180]  but there were no podcasts then,
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.600]  there wasn't even an option.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.620]  And now folks that come along later like Joe Rogan
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.900]  feels like in the same kind of line, right?
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.500]  You know, kind of a little off the wall, an interviewer,
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.520]  you know, I'm not a close listener to either,
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.860]  so I'm by no means an expert on this,
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:09.700]  but similar in spirit, even if the format is different.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.960]  With Bill Simmons, our first time,
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.360]  I know he wasn't born at ESPN,
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.060]  but I certainly became aware of him
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:21.300]  when he was writing at ESPN, I guess in the late 90s?
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.140]  I forget.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.640]  Yeah, I think it was 1999 or something,
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.580]  because he had like an AOL channel.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.420]  That's how he started.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.360]  See, I wouldn't have known that because I never had AOL,
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.340]  but it's like, you know, he can say he wasn't a blogger,
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.620]  and I know exactly what you mean though,
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.560]  because you couldn't, his writing felt right at home
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.360]  in a web browser window.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.200]  That's right.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.000]  So whether you wanna say it was a blog or not,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.060]  it certainly was native to the web,
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:47.460]  and he was liberal with his links,
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:51.340]  and wrote with a way where it wasn't just, you know, like,
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.060]  and you could see it here,
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.900]  and the word here is a length to it.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.740]  There was no editing for length, yeah.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.840]  Yeah, and there was no editing for length,
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.840]  and you could go sprawling, but he would, you know,
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.820]  to me, a native hypertext added a dimension to writing
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.900]  that was literally impossible before,
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:12.860]  and you could be a terrific web writer and not embrace it,
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:15.120]  but it's like, I'm almost like,
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.140]  like one way of putting it is that you can do it
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.260]  as a sort of form of sarcasm,
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.740]  where you could make a certain word, a link,
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.780]  and the thing that it links to, if you followed the link,
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.540]  would make you realize that, oh, that's sarcasm,
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.300]  but you wouldn't realize it was sarcasm
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.540]  if you didn't follow the link,
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.700]  because, you know, you know what I mean?
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.620]  I think that that's really profound, actually.
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.980]  It added a new dimension to writing,
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:44.940]  that, and this idea of it was not possible on print.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.660]  It was only possible on the web,
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.280]  and then the mechanisms became blogs,
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.460]  but the style was web writing.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.820]  I think that's exactly what it is,
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.180]  and I think this makes me quick for the Stern thing, too,
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.100]  because the best sort of Howard Stern shows are timeless,
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.500]  right, there's an aspect where you can listen to it
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.900]  live, or you can listen to it later,
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.500]  or you can listen to it a few years down the road,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.100]  and it still can be funny, it still can be informative,
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.940]  it can still be all these sorts of things,
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:14.660]  and that is, podcasting, that's a big part of podcasting.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.320]  It's not a live show.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.580]  It's a time-shifted show that shifts with you,
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:22.120]  and so that kind of quicks what I was trying to go at
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.420]  with that sort of essence sort of idea.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.920]  I think that's exactly right.
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.920]  And the nature of the Stern show,
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.620]  if you just listen to it,
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.000]  it certainly sounds a lot like a podcast.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.780]  I mean, he's a super professional broadcaster,
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:42.780]  and he's also born gifted with a truly fantastic voice.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.280]  I mean, it's just an unbelievably terrific voice,
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.280]  and it's sort of like the equivalent
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.740]  of having just a beautiful typography in a written thing.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.040]  But the advantage of writing is that
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.480]  you can pick somebody else's font.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.060]  I'm stuck with my voice.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.400]  And that's part of his anti-podcaster shtick,
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.280]  is that he thinks that people just plug in a USB microphone
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.120]  and start blathering,
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.280]  and they don't know what they're doing,
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.280]  and they didn't go through the process that he did,
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.560]  where he literally started as a traditional disc jockey,
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.960]  back when being a disc jockey actually involved discs
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.840]  that you jockeyed about as you played records on a radio,
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.220]  and learned to work a control board,
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.760]  and actually understands how an FM radio station
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.960]  actually broadcasts its signal,
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.120]  because you had to do it,
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.400]  and to have the job, you had to be certified,
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.880]  and have a license from the FCC, I think.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.920]  And going through all of that today's world,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.200]  it doesn't even make any sense, you know what I mean?
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.400]  You can't expect everybody who has an audio show,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.900]  whether they call it a podcast or not,
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:08.900]  to learn the chops of being a disc jockey on FM radio
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.740]  at 1979 or something like that,
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:15.040]  when it was, literally they were making hit TV shows
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.400]  about how cool it was to be a disc jockey on FM radio.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.280]  I remember back when I was in college,
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.480]  and I worked for the student newspaper,
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.680]  I thought it was great fun, particularly to be a columnist.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.120]  And so I'm like, I want to be a columnist,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.520]  I want to be a columnist for the New York Times.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.000]  And so I went to the New York Times,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.400]  I looked at everybody's bios,
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.200]  and most of them were journalists for 20, 30 years
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.080]  before they finally got the perch
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.840]  on the opinion page, right?
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.240]  And I'm like, I don't want to be a journalist,
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.560]  I want to be a columnist.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.480]  I don't want to go cover high school track meets
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.920]  or city council meetings
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.400]  and work your way up the chain, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.360]  But that's the way it was done.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.000]  What I did, I looked at, there's William Safire,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.640]  who was a speech writer for Nixon.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.300]  And I'm like, that sounds a much more interesting path.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.000]  I'm going to go work in politics
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.920]  and then transition over to be a columnist.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.320]  I realized that working in politics
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.360]  is actually absolutely miserable,
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.240]  even worse than being a journalist.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.000]  Pretty good any sort of beliefs or ideals.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.880]  But it turned out, because of the internet,
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.440]  I was able to become a columnist
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.400]  just in doing it directly.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:25.360]  And I can imagine for a traditional newspaper person
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.160]  that put in years and years and worked their way up,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.080]  and then I'm coming in with my WordPress blog
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.600]  and challenging them for attention and opinion,
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.200]  it has to be a little irritating.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:39.320]  Yeah, I can imagine that.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.080]  I mean, for those who don't remember,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.440]  I was a huge, I'm not surprised to hear,
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.360]  I don't think we've ever talked about Safire before,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.360]  but no surprise that I was an enormous Safire fan
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.360]  and definitely came upon what I wanted to do the same way.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.440]  But Safire, everybody who does know him
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.240]  knows him for two columns that he wrote
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.680]  for the New York Times over the years.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.300]  Primarily, he was one of the full-time op-ed columnists,
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:11.200]  like Space Now, occupied by Paul Krugman and Maureen Dowd.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:15.480]  I think Ross Douthat is the conservative heir,
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.160]  because they always have someone on the right.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:19.840]  Right.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.420]  I mean, I don't want to name them all,
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.240]  but Tom Friedman is like the resident jackass.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.420]  Actually, they have a couple, because they got David Brooks.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.200]  And Brooks is sort of, they never really fully
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.360]  replaced Safire, because Safire's thing
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.680]  was that he was the conservative on the liberal op-ed page
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.200]  of the liberal New York Times, where
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.240]  at least the liberal editorial page and op-ed page
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.720]  were always politically liberal, even
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.720]  notwithstanding any sort of dispute or argument
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.600]  over whether the news coverage has a political slam, which
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.760]  is neither here nor there.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.960]  But Safire was the conservative.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.320]  And his bona fides as a Nixon speechwriter
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.560]  pretty much certified that.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.800]  I mean, that's pretty credible.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.400]  He's never really been fully replaced.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.980]  But the other thing that Safire had
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.960]  was the On Language column in the Sunday magazine.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.720]  And so as a political junkie, who still to this day
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.400]  loves reading perspectives I don't agree with,
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.640]  although it's harder and harder to find reasoned ones.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.640]  But Safire was one who I always enjoyed.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.600]  I disagreed with him more often than not.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.320]  But overall, especially in my younger, in my 20s,
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.920]  and even late teens, my politics were,
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.920]  by the standards of US political discourse, centrist.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.520]  I wasn't really, you could ask me,
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.560]  here's the top 10 issues of the day.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.040]  And I wouldn't really fall as somebody you would say,
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.600]  well, that guy's a diehard liberal,
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.880]  whereas now it's bifurcated.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.980]  Right, because the Environmental Protection Agency
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.400]  I think came in under Nixon, right?
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.240]  Just to give a perspective of how different
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:08.720]  things were to be on the right or the left way back then.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.300]  So the entire existence of the Environmental
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.480]  Protection Agency came in under Nixon.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.480]  The idea that conservatives would be into conservation
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.080]  was something that was, it was repeated often.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.600]  It was actually taken as like, this goes hand in hand,
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.920]  that we're conservatives politically
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.120]  because we are hesitant to make changes fast.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.720]  And you know, these forests have been here
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.220]  for a very long time, long before we were here.
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:39.880]  We should keep them and say, you know,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.040]  keep them the way they are, you know?
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.040]  Like that was considered hand in hand with conservatism.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.060]  The other one that's so, people just wouldn't believe it.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.520]  It was that Nixon came within like a whisker
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.180]  of passing nationalized healthcare.
[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.400]  Like.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.060]  Well, I mean, he issued price controls too.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:02.480]  I mean, which is the, yeah, it was a different era.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.520]  And maybe, you know, I think maybe,
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.720]  I don't know how apocryphal it is,
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.880]  but I think as a nutshell synopsis
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:12.020]  without really going into a longer than a breath
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.480]  digression on this, the basic gist of the Nixon
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.920]  nationalized healthcare proposal was that it pretty much
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.780]  got stymied by Ted Kennedy of all people
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.580]  on the Kennedy's thinking being,
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.360]  I don't want Nixon to be the one to pass it.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.080]  I want to be president in 76 or maybe 1980,
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.600]  and I'll be the one to pass it.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.080]  And so Ted Kennedy as the liberal stalwart in the Senate
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.600]  sort of put the brakes on Nixon passing
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.400]  what would now be considered extraordinarily
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.480]  left wing healthcare in the United States.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.480]  But anyway, that's where Sapphire came from.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:50.020]  And I was exactly like you and thought,
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:53.800]  boy, that's the sort of writing I feel like I want to do.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.860]  I feel like I could do.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.860]  It is, it somehow, the form, tone, nature of it
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:04.900]  just is so appealing to me, and I don't want to do
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.900]  any sort of working my way up the ladder to get there.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.680]  And in some ways.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.060]  It sounds terrible when you put it that way,
[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.280]  but yes, it's totally true.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.800]  All right, so imagine that you really,
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.560]  your mind, you're a young person
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.640]  and you're drawn to the military.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.120]  And you think to yourself,
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.540]  boy, what I would like to be is a general.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.540]  That seems like, that just is what I want to do.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.360]  That seems like a fulfilling life.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.700]  I think I'd be good at it.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:39.320]  I think it's important work.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.780]  I would like to sign up and become a general.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:44.560]  Well, it doesn't really even make any sense
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.220]  that it would work that way.
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.360]  Whereas it didn't make sense to me
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.320]  that to become like an op-ed columnist
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.280]  or a business page columnist or a tech,
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.120]  you know, personal technology columnist
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.440]  that you should be expected to work your way up the ladder
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.600]  by starting as like a city hall reporter,
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.280]  reporting on like, you know, the city council meeting
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.840]  where they're talking about whether to change
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.920]  the street cleaning days from Tuesday and Thursday
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.800]  to Wednesday and Friday.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.760]  You know, like it just doesn't seem like
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.060]  it doesn't make any sense that for what I want to do
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.200]  that I should start that way.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.000]  Whereas working your way up the ladder in the military,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.200]  it, you know, to name one example, it feels like it does.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.820]  And I think that's been proven out
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:32.640]  because once it became possible to take an alternate path,
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.120]  it turns out that path works very, very well.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.000]  Like there's no, you know, and it's one of the things
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.400]  that is pretty neat about the internet
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.360]  and the fact that, you know,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.640]  like all our archives are out there.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.600]  You can go back and read.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.840]  Do you read everything I've written?
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.880]  You know, a few thousand pieces over the last,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.360]  you know, six, seven years.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.920]  And to believe or do what I write about now,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.960]  well, you can look back and see what I wrote before.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.760]  And, you know, you can correct things.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.240]  That's another great thing about writing the internet.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.840]  We've talked about, you know, if you get something wrong,
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.160]  you get to go back and change it.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.120]  And then you can write a new post saying I got this wrong.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.360]  This is why I got it wrong, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.000]  And so there's a certain credibility enhancing factor
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.360]  of the internet that's sort of built in
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.280]  if you are willing to sort of embrace it
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.440]  in a way that, you know, you put a column out there
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.360]  on a newspaper that is printed and it's set.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.720]  It is what it is.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.400]  And in that world, sorry,
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.680]  I'm just kind of thinking all out here.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.080]  In that world where you printed a paper
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.200]  and there was so much permanence attached,
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.800]  maybe it did make more sense to have a long path
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.320]  because you had to really make sure
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.520]  you had the right person in that role.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.480]  They had to be vetted.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.920]  They had to be experienced
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.880]  because the cost of mistakes was way higher.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.560]  Whereas the cost of mistakes on the internet
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.480]  are much lower sort of for better or worse.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.560]  Well, and I think the other factor that always,
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.320]  I think there's part of that, part of that it was justified
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.520]  and I think part of it was that there was just so,
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.760]  there was just so few space for it, right?
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.280]  Because there was.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.120]  That's right, yeah.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.760]  There was just one page in the newspaper.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.600]  You know, that's, this was like something that like,
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.120]  it was like a light bulb in my head in college,
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.080]  like same as you, like going through the student newspaper.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.760]  I thought the op-ed page was for opinion and editorial,
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.480]  but op-ed stands for opposite the editorial
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.680]  where the, I mean, maybe it stands for both.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.120]  Maybe it's one of those things that has multiple origins.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.520]  But the idea is that it's just tradition
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.000]  and if you buy the print New York Times
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.040]  or the Washington Post, it still works this way
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.560]  where you go, you look in the index and it says,
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.480]  here's where the editorial page is
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.480]  and you go turn to page 16.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.240]  The newspaper's editorial, which isn't traditionally,
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.440]  isn't bylined, it's written by the editorial board
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.600]  and is sort of the opinion voice of the newspaper itself
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.840]  is on the left-hand page and there's letters to the editor
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.160]  and maybe a political cartoon on that page.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.960]  And then on the right-hand page
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.720]  is where the op-ed columns are.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:14.760]  Usually one or two from the staff,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.400]  op-ed writers and columnists,
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.400]  and then the submissions from freelancers and statesmen
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.140]  and whoever else might submit was on that page.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.080]  There's just one page in the newspaper,
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.440]  so it's super competitive.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.720]  And I think there were a lot of people
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.000]  who had that feeling like, well, that's what I wanna do.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.200]  I wanna be the, I'd like to be the op-ed columnist
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.560]  or, and one of them.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.720]  It was so competitive that I think it just made sense
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.600]  that within the newspaper there were so many people
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.640]  who wanted the job that when a spot opened
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.480]  that of course it went to one of them first,
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.320]  whether they were the best for the job or not.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.200]  And it was someone deciding, right?
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.880]  The op-ed editor, whoever was in charge,
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.000]  decided who got on that page.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.440]  And I think what makes the,
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.080]  the thing about the internet that is great
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.720]  from our perspective and maybe very threatening
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.920]  from a sort of newspaper perspective is no one decides.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.840]  Anyone can go out there and can set up a page
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:21.500]  and can succeed or fail based on the traffic they get
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.160]  on where they can charge money.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.840]  And this is the great thing about being open.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.400]  This is the worry about Spotify.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.240]  It's the worry about having someone in the center
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.960]  deciding what can be on or not.
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.000]  It's the problem with YouTube that Rogan ran into.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.280]  YouTube can decide if you're on there or not.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.120]  Whereas on the open web, when it comes to web pages
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.320]  or in podcasting, open podcasting, no one can decide.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.080]  I got a question where, you know,
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.520]  so dithering is not on Spotify.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.360]  Right.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.140]  Because you can't put in an arbitrary RSS feed.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.080]  So I was like, well, if Spotify add the capability
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.960]  for RSS feeds, would you let dithering go on Spotify?
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.840]  I'm like, I wouldn't have a choice.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.520]  That's the whole point of being open, right?
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.600]  So they're like, oh, exponent's not on there.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.360]  Would you just exponent them?
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.640]  It wouldn't be up to me.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.940]  If they let arbitrary RSS feeds go on there,
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.560]  anyone could put that on there and I couldn't control that
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.520]  and that's exactly how I want it to be.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.520]  Right, and again, to make two analogies
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.120]  where the way it works makes a lot more sense to people
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.680]  who maybe don't think about it deeply.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.280]  It's like, imagine somebody comes out
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.060]  with a new email client.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.920]  And, you know, it's just new client software
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:34.840]  and you can use this client and get your email
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:37.380]  on your phone or wherever you're using it.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.000]  Will Hectary's daily updates still show up?
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.400]  Well, yeah, of course, it's just an email client.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.760]  Your email address didn't change.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.200]  It's just gonna show all the email
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.720]  that shows up in your inbox.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.240]  Or when somebody comes out with a new browser
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.000]  and, you know, however much we've ossified
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.680]  in the number of browser engines,
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.880]  the number of browsers continues
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.760]  to be a little bit more fluid
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.520]  as, you know, Microsoft has switched to Chromium
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:06.240]  and there's a relatively new browser called Brave
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:07.600]  that a lot of people use.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.760]  You know, Brave comes out and it's a new browser
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.340]  built on the Chromium engine.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.220]  I don't, like, sign terms and conditions
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.880]  and agree to something so that daringfireball.net renders
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.360]  and you can read it in Brave
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.380]  and that your bookmarks, you know, import over
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.160]  and if you, you know, like to have Daring Fireball
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.620]  in your favorites bar and click it in the morning
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:34.920]  to see what's new, I may not even know
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.240]  that there's a new browser out.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.880]  It just happens, right?
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.760]  And so the same thing, like if Spotify allowed you
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.220]  to just add, you know, there's a plus button
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:46.180]  and then you could paste an RSS feed in there,
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:47.640]  dithering would just show up.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.800]  Yep, that's exactly right.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.720]  I mean, the challenge I think from Spotify,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.960]  I think there's two issues.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.320]  One is they wanna control everything.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.360]  I think there might just be a technical issue though
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.560]  because Spotify streams everything, right?
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:01.440]  And so the problem with the RSS thing
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.480]  is it's pulling in an MP3
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.700]  and they don't probably even have like the,
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.360]  you know, do they even have the data model
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.660]  in the Spotify app to house an MP3?
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.540]  Like how is that going to work?
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.140]  I mean, but honestly, if they supported this,
[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:21.140]  like I seem like the most extreme anti-Spotify thing,
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:25.680]  but my opposition is I'm actually fine with them
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:28.360]  trying to figure out this new model for podcasting.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.240]  As long as you preserve the openness for other models
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.300]  to be figured out as well, right?
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.480]  And the great thing about going direct,
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.760]  you know, the solution to these aggregators,
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.440]  these people that try to collect all the users
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.360]  and monetize them more effectively
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360]  because they're all centralized
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.380]  considering the customized ads, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:51.560]  The solution is to go direct to customers
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.760]  and how do you go direct to customers?
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.880]  You ask them to pay you, right?
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.640]  And that's kind of what we're doing.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.400]  And it works with Facebook, right?
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.640]  I pay to check your links on Facebook.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.960]  And if you want to get the paid stuff,
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.120]  you can pay me directly.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.560]  Facebook's not involved at all.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.880]  And yeah, there's broader issues about Facebook
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.440]  and Google and journalism in the longterm,
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.060]  but you are still able, the New York Times, for example,
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:19.200]  can build a thriving business by connecting directly
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.080]  with consumers who pay them directly
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.020]  and Google and Facebook can't touch that at all.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.540]  And Spotify is not allowing that.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.600]  That's what's frustrating.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.300]  I think it's, I don't know, before we move on,
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:32.540]  I think it's worth circling back to Howard Stern
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.800]  and as the proto podcaster.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.400]  And part of it is fundamentally
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.940]  about the content of the show,
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.240]  which is that if you just have a recording of the show
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.500]  and you listen to it, it sounds a lot like
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.880]  what people would think of as a podcast today.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.560]  Strong personalities, Howard Stern, his co-host
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.380]  or whatever you, however you want to describe,
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:55.300]  Robin Quiver's role on the show,
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.560]  the other regulars who are on the show,
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.240]  the way that the show flows, it's just, you know,
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:07.740]  it's all personality-based and it's not, you know, like,
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:11.240]  well, it's exactly an hour long and there's 20 minutes in,
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.120]  there's a break, and then 20 more minutes in,
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.640]  there's a break, you know, it goes with the flow
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.640]  and it's longer, you know, that's podcast-like.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.020]  But then in the modern era, what's so interesting
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.240]  is how he forged this independent, you know,
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.180]  and again, he's on Sirius XM,
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:35.180]  but his independence is remarkable, historically speaking.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:41.640]  He was on FM radio, regular old-fashioned radio
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:44.060]  over public airwaves and you'd tune in on FM
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.440]  and it was syndicated around the country.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.520]  And, but basically you therefore had to listen
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.220]  when he was on, right, that's how FM radio worked.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:54.900]  And technically, I guess somebody could tape it
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:58.200]  and circulate tapes, but, you know, there was no other way,
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.500]  there was no way to time shift for most people
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.740]  who weren't nerds.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.540]  And, you know, he had a massive, massive audience
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.240]  and was making a lot of money,
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.620]  but was also fighting the FCC on a regular basis
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.360]  because being on FM radio meant you, you know,
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:19.660]  had to adhere to FCC regulations on things
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.020]  like curse words and content of the show.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:26.700]  And, you know, his show is,
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.420]  I don't know what other adjectives he used,
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:31.780]  but to use one, it was raunchy or remains raunchy
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:34.580]  where, you know, there might be actors
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:37.220]  from porno movies or something like that
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.540]  who were the guests of the show of the day
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.220]  talking about subject matter that would violate
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:45.420]  FCC regulations for what you can say on FM radio.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:47.820]  And literally millions of dollars of fines,
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:52.820]  and, you know, what he did is he took his ball,
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.660]  went home, and went to satellite radio,
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.100]  which people thought was crazy
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.820]  because, you know, satellite radio was this small niche
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.760]  and people had to pay for it.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.300]  And when he did it in 2004,
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:09.420]  the degree that people had to jump through hoops
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.940]  compared to everybody could get FM radio
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.860]  on just about anything that played audio,
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:18.360]  your car, your Walkman, like even your tape players
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.700]  used to always have built-in radio receivers.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:21.540]  You couldn't, you know,
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.380]  even if all you really wanted to do
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:26.380]  was play cassette tapes on a Walkman,
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.940]  it also had AM and FM radio reception
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.300]  because why not, right?
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.940]  Whereas Sirius XM, where I guess Sirius and XM
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.740]  used to be two companies and he went to Sirius,
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.820]  but you had to have dedicated hardware
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:42.500]  to get their proprietary satellite signal.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.380]  You had to subscribe to their service,
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:46.020]  which costs money every month,
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.440]  and even if you were a Sirius subscriber,
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.020]  you didn't get the Howard Stern Show automatically
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.620]  with your paid subscription to a proprietary service
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.820]  that you had proprietary hardware for,
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.780]  you also had to pay an additional subscription monthly
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.980]  to get the Stern Show, and people did it.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.420]  Yeah, well, you know, it worked
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:07.660]  because he signed a new contract five years later
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.380]  for like another $100 million or $90 million for five years,
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:14.620]  which included like fewer shows per week,
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.140]  so he lightened his burden,
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.940]  so clearly it was successful from Sirius' perspective,
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:22.260]  and you put that in the context here,
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.980]  all you have to do with Spotify is just switch to an app
[01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:28.060]  you probably already have on your phone.
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.460]  Right, right, so it's a lot, you know, right.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.460]  If the Joe Rogan Show only, if the only people who go,
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.620]  like, you know, there's,
[01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.020]  how many people listen to a show is hard to estimate.
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.700]  You can kind of get a good gauge
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.020]  of how many times a show is downloaded
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.580]  through regular traditional download statistics
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:49.640]  from a web server.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:53.720]  How that translates into actual listeners
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.380]  is sort of impossible to say.
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.580]  It's the same, you know,
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.220]  gauging the audience is always pretty difficult, right?
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.780]  You can measure how many subscribers you have,
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.740]  but how many people read the subscription, I don't know.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:08.180]  How many people listen to a show that's been downloaded?
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.380]  How many people download it three times
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.480]  because they have three different podcast apps
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.860]  that automatically download it,
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.900]  but they only listen to it in one?
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.520]  You know, it's not one-to-one,
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.860]  but, you know, you can kind of get a rough number.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:26.420]  What was interesting, actually, this is as an aside,
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:29.300]  one thing that I realized while sort of writing
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:33.300]  about this stuff is it's hard to measure market share
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.140]  of podcast players in part
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:37.780]  because your typical podcast player plugged
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.980]  into the open ecosystem downloads podcasts all the time.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:42.220]  You can set it to stream only,
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.820]  but most people, they just download the podcast,
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:45.980]  and so when they hit play, it's already downloaded
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:47.740]  and they can play the MP3.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:50.620]  Whereas Spotify, because everything is streamed,
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.940]  what Spotify does to accommodate the world,
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:56.200]  like, because downloads is sort of like the defined,
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.140]  accepted measure in the podcast world.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.920]  So Spotify, when you hit play,
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.380]  will tag or sort of like tap the original MP3
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.380]  so it registers a download,
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.820]  but then Spotify is just streaming it.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:14.180]  But the implication is Spotify, a Spotify download,
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.200]  is if you go to your analytics page for your podcast,
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.340]  and there'll be a Spotify category,
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:21.700]  the Spotify download is actually a listen
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.520]  because they only do that tagging
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.140]  when you actually click play on the podcast,
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:29.420]  which means that Spotify is always undercounted
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.900]  because they don't have the bonus
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:34.740]  of downloading a bunch, like, downloading podcasts
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.340]  that you never actually listen to.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:38.820]  And so it's kind of tricky, actually,
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.940]  to figure out how much market share do they have
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:44.140]  because their downloads actually equal listens
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.900]  in a way they don't for anyone else.
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.700]  And they have an incredible installed base already.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:51.980]  I mean, that's the point we're getting to,
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.540]  is it's not like an upstart like Luminary,
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:58.280]  where Luminary is this new, I guess it's a year old now,
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.120]  that only does podcasts and is only proprietary
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.620]  and requires you to download the new thing.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.820]  The whole point I'm trying to make here
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:08.100]  is that if the only people who move
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:11.380]  from Joe Rogan's current podcast that's open
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.740]  to his new one that's Spotify exclusive
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.140]  are people who already, as of today,
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.940]  you know, May 20th, 2020,
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.660]  already have Spotify on their phone,
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.700]  that's, it could work, right?
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.100]  Because there's like 280-some million
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.580]  Spotify users out there.
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.520]  You know, they don't need new Spotify users
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.020]  to make the Joe Rogan deal work.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.860]  Presumably, Spotify, you know, probably has a good idea
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.720]  that there's some number of tens of thousands,
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.960]  hundreds of thousands, perhaps, Joe Rogan listeners
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.460]  who are huge Joe Rogan fans who don't have Spotify
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.440]  or don't subscribe or something like that,
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.980]  who will, and he'll have months to go
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:53.860]  in the rest of this year to remind people
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.820]  on a regular basis, multiple times a week,
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:59.380]  his show is like three, four times a week,
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.660]  I think like four times a week, you know,
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:04.500]  to say, hey, we're moving to Spotify,
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.300]  get the Spotify app, you know,
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.900]  it'll be part of the show, I'm sure,
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.900]  I mean, it wouldn't make sense not to,
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.360]  but they don't really have to get a new app,
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.140]  most of them, right?
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.220]  That's exactly right, and whereas the other thing
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:21.020]  with the Luminary thing is, to think about is,
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.420]  Luminary is, wants to charge a subscription fee up front,
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.540]  so not only do you have to download a new app,
[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.620]  you also have to pay, whereas,
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:29.900]  this is where it's important, remember,
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.740]  Spotify does have a subscription layer,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.340]  of course, and they say that some people
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.420]  that listen to podcasts, you know, convert,
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.760]  and it's been good for that part of the business,
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.060]  but this is really, really all about advertising,
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:44.200]  and there was a little thing that Spotify did
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.120]  on the last earnings call, which was,
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.460]  they shifted how they accounted for content costs,
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:51.020]  because they bought the ringer, they bought the gimlet,
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.900]  so they're getting all these costs for producing content,
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:57.060]  and they used to split the cost sort of proportionally
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.940]  between their subscription business
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.440]  and their advertising business,
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.140]  because, you know, both sides listen to it.
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:05.340]  What they did was, they went back and they said,
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:06.820]  actually, all these costs go
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.660]  on the advertising side of the business,
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:09.820]  and why do you do that?
[01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:13.140]  Because the point of accruing those costs
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:15.740]  is to build the advertising business,
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.860]  and that's just a more honest representation
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:20.780]  of your numbers, and I think it really speaks
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.140]  to the fact that this makes sense,
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.020]  and so, to go back to the Rogan thing,
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:28.100]  so he's switching over, Spotify's paying him this money,
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:30.060]  because they wanna build the advertising business,
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.420]  whereas if, say, Luminary signed Joe Rogan,
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.580]  and say it was successful, in the way that Sirius
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.220]  was successful for Howard Stern, right,
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:39.020]  and suddenly Luminary is a super popular podcast,
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:42.620]  well, what Joe Rogan could do is go to Luminary and say,
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.220]  you need to pay me more, because I'm the one driving
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:48.020]  all this money in a very sort of direct way,
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:50.780]  and if you don't pay me more, I'll just go independent,
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.620]  whereas on Spotify, Spotify's building an advertising engine
[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.240]  that Joe Rogan or any single podcaster couldn't,
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.840]  because the scale of an advertising business
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.140]  is so much greater than any one person,
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.400]  whereas a subscription is much more
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.900]  of a sort of one-to-one thing,
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:07.480]  and that scale mismatch is why it's a win-win
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.840]  for Spotify and Rogan to work together,
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:11.740]  whereas Rogan and Luminary would immediately
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.700]  be negotiating over who gets the biggest share
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:16.940]  of the subscription, and Rogan would take the most,
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:20.500]  whereas, and you go to Stern, so Stern was subscribers,
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:22.660]  but you had to have satellites in the air, right?
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.420]  You had to have, like, devices,
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.560]  and Stern couldn't do that on his own,
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.460]  so he needed, he needed Sirius.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:32.020]  Sirius had some sort of leverage in the relationship
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.160]  in a way that Luminary, because it's all just bits
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.780]  on the internet, had no, even if Luminary succeeded,
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:40.580]  even if they got tons of subscribers,
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.300]  what would happen is they would never, ever make any money,
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:45.260]  because the most popular podcasters
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.980]  that drove the subscriptions would renegotiate
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:50.020]  to take all the money, and so it was just kind of
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.780]  a doomed model from the beginning,
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.100]  because they weren't doing anything
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:56.780]  that any podcaster couldn't have done on their own.
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.360]  Right, it's, that's the, and that's the question
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:03.540]  that comes up, is, is Joe Rogan better off now,
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:06.300]  or will he be better off when he moves to Spotify
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:10.060]  than he was already with what's inarguably
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:14.700]  the super popular podcast, and already making tons of money,
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.900]  and it's not that hard, and you don't really need,
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:18.420]  there's not really a lot of overhead,
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.300]  you don't need, to your point,
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.860]  you don't need satellites in the air,
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:24.740]  you don't need your own custom,
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:26.580]  you don't even need your own custom app, right,
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:30.140]  which isn't that much to ask, it's not that much to build,
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.920]  but in fact, in the open podcast world,
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.920]  it's actually contrary to, it's a bad idea,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.500]  and probably slows adoption if you build your own app.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500]  It's better, all you need is an RSS feed,
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:48.500]  which really is, technically speaking, trivial to publish.
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:50.020]  That's right, that's right.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.900]  You know, it's very interesting to think about,
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:55.620]  because he's, so he's also making less than Stern did,
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.420]  right, because Stern was making,
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:59.780]  Stern, or was Stern making 20 million a year,
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.940]  or was it 100 million dollars a year?
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:03.300]  I think it's. No, I think 20 million, so.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.740]  Yeah, there's like five year deals for 90 million dollars,
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:08.460]  or a five year deal for 90 million dollars.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.340]  Yeah, whereas the Rogan thing, I think,
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.620]  could be up to 100 million dollars,
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:13.540]  so maybe it's actually roughly comparable.
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.460]  I heard it's for like three years or something,
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.500]  and there's a signing bonus,
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.660]  and increasing amount each year,
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.680]  but then there's like performance incentive,
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.860]  so I guess it's actually fairly comparable,
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.900]  but it's fairly comparable sort of 15 years on,
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:28.500]  so you know, there's some degree to which it's less,
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.340]  but I don't know, I think it's a win-win for,
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:36.340]  I mean, there's a degree, if you're very big,
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.260]  advertising is always gonna be, has the most upside,
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.260]  as far as sort of monetization goes.
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.700]  Like subscriptions are great,
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.320]  obviously I've built my whole career on subscriptions,
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.660]  but you are, by definition, limiting your audience,
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:52.060]  because people have to pay money to sort of
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.580]  get into your universe, and there's always,
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.480]  and you can't spread as well, it's hard to get viral,
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.180]  you know, because people are always hitting paywalls,
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:01.800]  like you, implied in a subscription
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.420]  is making it more difficult for people in some respects,
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.900]  but.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:08.460]  Well, I gotta interrupt, I gotta interrupt.
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:09.940]  Live, live correction here,
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.180]  I'm getting a feed here from the control room.
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.400]  Nope, we were wrong, I talked myself down.
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.420]  Stern's current deal from 2015 is a five year deal
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.860]  for 90 million per year.
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:21.180]  Oh hey, that's what I thought, that's what I thought,
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.300]  yeah, so Rogan is making a lot less,
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.500]  because he's making an average of,
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500]  I think it's around 30 million,
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:31.180]  once you sort of sketch it all out.
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:34.460]  That's whisper, I don't know if it's actually true or not.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:38.320]  It passes the sniff test, though, to me,
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.100]  in terms of how popular does,
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:46.700]  just the sniff test of how popular does Joe Rogan
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.340]  seem to me in popular culture compared to Howard Stern.
[01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.420]  And it seems to me like a 2020 deal,
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.420]  compared to 2015, where there's a lot more money
[01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:00.940]  in the market, and a player like Spotify,
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.380]  who wasn't in the market in 2015,
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.940]  I mean, Spotify was around, but they weren't
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.820]  throwing around 100 million dollar deals
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:10.600]  for podcast type hosts.
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:14.020]  It just, you know, and I just think, like,
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:18.340]  in terms of Howard Stern's enormous pop cultural presence,
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:20.200]  he was, for a couple of years,
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.500]  he was on the America's Got Talent show,
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.740]  I don't know if you ever watched it,
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:26.100]  it's not the type of show I watch,
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.180]  it's like one of those, yeah, it's a talent contest
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:32.140]  with celebrity judges, there's a bunch of them.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.940]  But they got Howard Stern to do it for two or three years,
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.460]  and I watched because of that, I've never watched before,
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.860]  and since he left, I haven't watched again,
[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:43.940]  but I watched when he was on,
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.460]  and it wasn't even that great,
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.660]  and he wasn't really as Howard Stern-y,
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:49.220]  it was sort of a dour, you know,
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:52.160]  it was appropriate for a primetime NBC show,
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.260]  but it still made for much better television
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:57.180]  than, in my opinion, than it was without him.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.500]  If Joe Rogan became the host of America's,
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:03.140]  or one of the judges on America's Got Talent,
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:05.660]  I think it would be news, I think it would bring in people,
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:07.700]  but it wouldn't be the sensation that Howard Stern was,
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.780]  so Rogan at, Rogan at, Rogan at the internet,
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:11.620]  oh, sorry, go ahead.
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:14.980]  Rogan at 30 million, compared to Stern at 90,
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:17.340]  in a five-year-old deal that's about to expire,
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:21.140]  feels, you know, passes the sniff test.
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:24.860]  Well, and this is the advantage that Howard Stern had, right?
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:28.400]  He might gripe about, I came up through the control board,
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.440]  and, you know, worked my way up, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.260]  but if you were able to sort of get in the door,
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.540]  because the problem was, there was a door, right,
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:37.580]  there was a gatekeeper, and if you were able to get in,
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:39.300]  if you were able to be William Safire,
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.100]  you were able to be whatever it might be,
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.220]  then you had very little competition,
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.940]  and so you had situations where Howard Stern
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.620]  could be on every radio station all over the entire country,
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:50.380]  and people had nothing else to listen to,
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.020]  so they listened to the radio, right?
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:53.820]  And we talked, you see this with, like, TV shows,
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.580]  you know, we talked about, like, Seinfeld back in the day,
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:59.860]  you know, how could the entire country be watching one show,
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:02.180]  well, because there weren't that many shows to watch,
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:07.020]  and so there was, it was very beneficial for you,
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:08.860]  if you could get through the door,
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:12.160]  and if you could get on top, the payback was way greater
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.140]  back then, whereas today, sure,
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:16.020]  Joe Rogan's the most popular podcaster,
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:17.860]  yeah, he has millions of downloads,
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:20.820]  but he's competing against hundreds, not hundreds,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.980]  thousands, or if not millions of other podcasts
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.380]  and other users for their time,
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.120]  I listen to podcasts all the time,
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.860]  I don't listen to Rogan at all,
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.380]  whereas to imagine if I, oh, I watch TV all the time,
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:32.760]  but I've never seen Seinfeld,
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.380]  like, it's unimaginable back then,
[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:37.300]  in a way it is very much imaginable today.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:39.580]  Well, and Seinfeld is an interesting stake in the ground,
[01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:42.680]  too, because Seinfeld's finale aired,
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.700]  I forget what year, but I can't.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:45.540]  98.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.360]  I was gonna say.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.200]  In high school.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.140]  I could, yeah, I could get it within a year or two,
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.700]  because I knew it was within the two years
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:51.820]  of graduating from college,
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.460]  because I remember where I lived,
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.840]  and I was only there for one year,
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.500]  so yeah, 98 sounds right,
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.740]  and that's pre-DVR revolution,
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.940]  and I'm sure there's somebody out there,
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:04.020]  and probably people who listen to my show are among them,
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:07.220]  who you could, like, build your own DVR at the time,
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:11.020]  but, like, TiVo was relatively new in 2000,
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.500]  because I remember when I first saw TiVo.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.400]  Yeah, it came, it was introduced in 1999,
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.060]  so you're exactly right.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.980]  And I remember seeing TiVo the first time was at,
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.320]  he was just on the. It was mind-blowing.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:22.680]  Well, yeah, I remember, it was,
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.080]  I went to work at Barebone Software,
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.400]  the makers of BB Edit,
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.760]  and Amy and I weren't married yet,
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.460]  but she moved with me, and we went up,
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.500]  and Rich Siegel, co-founder of Barebone Software,
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.020]  had us over to his house for dinner.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.660]  It was delightful, and it was,
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:43.780]  I don't know who they were playing,
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.860]  and what level it was,
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:46.060]  but it was in the autumn,
[01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.140]  and the Yankees were in the playoffs,
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:50.980]  and he knew I was a baseball fan.
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:52.800]  Rich himself is a baseball fan,
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.200]  but he likes some other team.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.660]  I had, not the Yankees, I forget the name of them,
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:50:59.780]  but anyway, the Yankees were on TV,
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:02.620]  but we had dinner, and Rich had TiVo,
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:05.220]  and so we didn't have to eat dinner
[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:07.180]  while watching baseball.
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:12.180]  He, we just paused it, and there was no lag at all,
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.100]  and we could fast-forward these commercials,
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:18.300]  and it wasn't like, oh, when you're fast-forwarding,
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.580]  you just kind of have to guess how long,
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:21.780]  and oh, too far, nope.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.740]  You could just watch them stream by,
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.780]  and then right, boom, there we are,
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:30.780]  and I mean, we left, and it was the perfect device
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:35.780]  to sell both me and Amy on just this intersection
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:39.860]  of technology, and my God, this is wonderful.
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.740]  We just literally, the next morning,
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:45.460]  went to Best Buy or wherever you went in 2000
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.420]  to buy TiVos, and we bought a TiVo
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:48.460]  literally the next morning,
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:50.140]  because we couldn't even wait.
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:52.620]  It wasn't even something, it was like me buying the belt.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:55.180]  It was like, there is no way.
[01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:57.700]  If they were still open at night,
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.220]  we probably didn't leave his house
[01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:00.420]  until the baseball game was over.
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:02.460]  Probably like 11, 1130 or something like that.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.620]  If you could still, if Best Buy had 24 hours,
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.860]  we would have stopped at Best Buy on the way home.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.620]  It was that kind of moment.
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:11.860]  So I remember that Seinfeld was before that.
[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:14.540]  So everybody, not only did everybody watch,
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:15.940]  because there wasn't that much on TV,
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.580]  but everybody watched Thursday at nine o'clock on NBC.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.540]  Yeah, it's the only time to watch it, it's amazing.
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:23.180]  This evolution of technology point
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.220]  is really interesting, though,
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.780]  because you started out with TV broadcast,
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:28.940]  and then TiVo made it so you could time shift, right?
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:31.300]  That was the phrase that was used.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.340]  But I was thinking about this when you were talking about FM,
[01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.540]  how FM radios used to be built into everything,
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:41.060]  into your Walkman, into your stereo, whatever it might be.
[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.500]  And do you remember when the iPhone first came out,
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:45.780]  and the radio association was lobbying for Apple
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.460]  to include an FM radio into the phone?
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.540]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.700]  What's funny is what used to be ubiquitous
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.540]  is now very hard to access, right?
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:59.260]  Broadcast, whereas streaming, and so podcasts
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:02.740]  are actually easier to access in aggregate
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.380]  because your phone's with you everywhere,
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.900]  you always have an internet connection,
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.140]  and you can always just go and get a new podcast.
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.220]  Whereas for FM radio,
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:12.100]  which is what used to be thought of as ubiquitous,
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:14.140]  you have to go find a dedicated device
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:15.220]  that you might not have with you.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.420]  And the same thing with TV,
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:20.060]  where streaming was thought to be something exotic.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:23.420]  Actually, it's way more accessible and easy to get to,
[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:25.540]  and it's broadcasting that requires
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:27.940]  the specialized equipment and hard to get to.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:32.380]  It's funny how this shifts over time
[01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:34.740]  in what's easy and what's hard.
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:36.860]  Yeah, no, that's very true.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.740]  Like, if you told me right now
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.700]  that on like, you know, 93.3 WMMR,
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.380]  Philadelphia's, you know, FM rock station forever,
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:50.060]  that something fascinating was happening right now
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:55.060]  on 93.3 WMMR, the only way I could think to listen to it
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.540]  would be to go to my car.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:02.300]  Like, I honestly can't think of an FM radio,
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.420]  and I guess you could probably, I've never done it,
[01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:06.340]  I'm presuming you could go to a website
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.180]  and listen to their radio station,
[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:11.580]  but the only other way, other than turning my car on
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:14.100]  to tune into the FM radio station
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:17.140]  that I can think of right now that I could listen to it
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.820]  in my house would be to like,
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.180]  maybe hope you could get it over the internet,
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.460]  which is ridiculous, right?
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:25.940]  Like, that's, it's not even getting it over FM radio.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.380]  It would be going to their website
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:29.700]  and assuming they have some sort of stream.
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:31.780]  Yep, I remember, actually, I didn't realize
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:32.620]  events happened.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.820]  This is the early, early 90s.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.900]  I must've been in junior high school or high school,
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:40.860]  I can't remember, but there was a DJ in Madison
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.660]  called Johnny Danger, I think it was,
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.300]  and he locked himself in the studio
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:50.660]  and played I'm Too Sexy by,
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:53.460]  by right-side Fred for hours.
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:56.740]  He just kept playing it again and again and again.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.700]  And it was like, it was one of those moments,
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.060]  actually, you mentioned, where everyone's like,
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:04.060]  you have to go to your radio because this DJ lost his mind
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:07.460]  and is playing I'm Too Sexy again and again and again.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.540]  But he's locked himself in the only room
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:11.500]  that has the controls to turn it off.
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:13.420]  That's right, so they couldn't do anything about it.
[01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:15.620]  It was this big scandal.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.020]  But it was possible, we didn't think it was difficult.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:20.740]  Yeah, maybe we went to a car, maybe we had a Walkman,
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.860]  whatever it might be, whereas today, that would have happened
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.100]  and you're like, wow, that's crazy.
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:26.180]  And you'd be like, I'll wait for someone
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.780]  to post a clip to Twitter.
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:29.460]  I can see it then on there.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:34.420]  All right, let me take a final break here
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:38.700]  and tell you, it's spoiled, spoiler, Squarespace.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.580]  Thanks, Ben.
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:43.540]  But hey, guess what?
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:47.020]  The reason Squarespace, it was hard to guess
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.100]  as the sponsor of the show, they keep coming back
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:51.420]  because it actually is the truth
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.060]  that people who listen to the show
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.900]  keep signing up for Squarespace service.
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:58.500]  As they should, you should have your own website.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.820]  You should have your own URL.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.020]  Actually, I'm more than happy to endorse
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:04.660]  just the concept in general.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:07.140]  You should have your own site with your own URL.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:08.340]  You should not be on Medium
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:10.900]  or whatever these other sites of the day are.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:13.020]  Own your space on the internet.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.100]  And that's a great place to do it.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.260]  And I always say, if you actually know
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:21.420]  how to use View Source, which isn't that hard,
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.420]  but go and look.
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:25.580]  And an awful lot of the websites you use
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:28.380]  from places like local restaurants and stuff like that,
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:30.700]  that look totally great, totally branded,
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:33.620]  totally distinct to the brand of the restaurant
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:36.180]  or small business or personal website
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.780]  that you might be visiting,
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:39.340]  turns out they're built on Squarespace
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.820]  because Squarespace lets you build a website
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:44.820]  that you don't just own the domain
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.820]  and don't just control yourself and have the platform,
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.500]  but from a visual perspective, you own the brand.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.180]  And you can start with one of their great templates
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.420]  and tweak it from there.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.820]  You could build it from scratch
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.020]  if you know how to do that with CSS
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.580]  and design and stuff like that.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.940]  And it's just a great platform for that.
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.900]  And it gives you control.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:07.340]  And you can really do anything on a Squarespace site,
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:11.260]  everything from a blog to host a podcast,
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.780]  which we've been talking about,
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:15.020]  to have a store where you sell stuff
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:16.860]  and they handle all the commerce
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.580]  and all the stuff like that, really is great.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:21.900]  I know it just seems like everybody's out there.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.660]  If you're not the sort of person
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.700]  who's gonna use your quarantine time
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:27.860]  to learn how to bake sourdough bread,
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.740]  and maybe you're a little bit more in the ones and zeros side
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.860]  of how to use your idle time,
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.940]  and one of the ideas is to build a website
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:37.940]  or change an old website to something new and modern,
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:39.980]  starting at Squarespace
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:43.340]  and spending maybe even just an hour, two hours,
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:46.660]  with the free trial that lasts a whole month
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:49.620]  before you decide you wanna pay,
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:50.940]  it's a great place to start.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:53.540]  Then when you do pay, just remember the code, talk show,
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.540]  you get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:58.420]  So here's where you go, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:57:59.900]  They'll know you came from here.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:01.340]  They know you came from the show.
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:03.740]  And then when you do pay, when your free trial's over,
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:06.780]  same code, talk show, gets you 10% off.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.460]  And you could pay for a whole year.
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:10.380]  Add it up front, save 10%.
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:13.700]  That's like getting over a month free.
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.300]  Squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:19.020]  My thanks to them for their continued support of the show.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:24.380]  All right, let's talk about Dithering,
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.380]  which is the new podcast you and I,
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:30.380]  I'm guessing most of the people listening to this
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.220]  have already seen me mention it on Daring Fireball somehow.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:37.580]  I think I've done a fair amount of promotion for it, but.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.780]  Yeah, this is like the end of our promotional tour.
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.940]  Like first you came on the daily update,
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.180]  then you wrote a post, then I wrote a post,
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.420]  and now I'm here on the talk show.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.300]  So this is our last chance to make our case.
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:54.220]  But it's, you know, if you don't know,
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:56.980]  if you're, you know, only follow me
[01:58:56.980 --> 01:59:00.220]  by listening to the show, it is a new podcast.
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.260]  Ben and I have co-started.
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.900]  We've been recording since March,
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.300]  but we only unveiled it
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:07.860]  at the beginning of this month publicly.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:12.860]  Three times a week, 15 minutes per show,
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:15.260]  not a minute less, not a minute more.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:18.460]  So a little different format than the talk show.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:20.300]  To say the least.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.020]  It's amazing, the 15 minutes thing,
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:26.140]  like we, I don't remember who or how we came up with it.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:26.980]  We came up with the name
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.940]  at the end of the very last episode, remember that.
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:30.780]  But the first episode.
[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.900]  Yeah, the first episode, right.
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:33.220]  The first recorded episode.
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.740]  So, but I don't know how we got 15 minutes,
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:39.420]  but man, it is, it's like, the more we do it,
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:41.620]  the more I'm excited about it.
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:44.500]  The, like it's, in here, like we get on,
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.580]  we start recording, and it's like, are you recording it?
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:47.420]  Oh yeah, I'm recording.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:48.260]  Let's talk about, you know,
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:50.180]  Unix shell scripts for a while.
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:52.660]  Whereas, you know, it's a very sort of leisurely,
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:53.660]  let's talk about it.
[01:59:53.660 --> 01:59:55.380]  The talk show is great for, you know,
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.660]  it can be, you know, it's more like a talk show
[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:00.020]  in some respects, it's just right there in the name.
[02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:02.700]  Whereas when you feel that clock ticking,
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:04.340]  we're both looking at a timer,
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:05.900]  and we know exactly how much is in there.
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:08.900]  It's such a different feeling and a different energy.
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:12.460]  It's like, I, this is, sounds ridiculous,
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:14.300]  because I'm talking about my own product
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.140]  that I want people to buy.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.740]  But it's honestly, it's really fun.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:21.740]  Well, and part of the stuff that we didn't know,
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:25.060]  I mean, and we'd been noodling on the idea for months,
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:26.460]  maybe even longer.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.300]  I mean, and speaking of, I mean,
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:31.860]  and basically it started, and I'll give full credit to you,
[02:00:31.860 --> 02:00:34.540]  that you latched onto the idea at least a year ago,
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:36.620]  maybe you've probably been thinking about it longer,
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:40.180]  that podcasts are ripe
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:44.060]  for subscription-based monetization.
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:45.620]  And that's the other thing with Dithering,
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.340]  and it's very different from this show,
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.820]  is in addition to a very regular schedule,
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:51.820]  we come out Monday morning, Wednesday morning,
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:56.700]  Friday morning, Eastern time in the US, three times a week.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:00.420]  Every episode is literally 15 minutes on the button.
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.060]  I believe every single time,
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:03.540]  if you look in your podcast player
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:07.260]  and it shows you like minutes and seconds, it's 15 colon 00.
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:12.260]  Like it's not 14.57, it's not 15.03, 15.00.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:16.780]  Which is different.
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:20.700]  Different than the talk show.
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.700]  But you had this idea,
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:25.820]  but the other thing is that it's subscription-based,
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:30.820]  and it's $5 a month or $50 a year.
[02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:35.740]  We've built this on top of the same membership system
[02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:38.700]  that is behind Stratechery,
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:42.100]  your subscription-based email newsletter.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:44.500]  It's funny, because this is something
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:45.340]  that I didn't think about
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.260]  until I started writing about Dithering,
[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:49.620]  is that, you've been a guest on this show
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:50.700]  many times over the years.
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.620]  You and I have become good friends.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:54.360]  Now we're colleagues.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.960]  But I've always been able to describe Stratechery
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.220]  as primarily a subscription newsletter.
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:01.620]  But now it almost feels like that's not quite right.
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.340]  And not in a way that's bad,
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:06.420]  but part of the evolution of this platform
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:08.900]  is that now Stratechery is also,
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:11.660]  you can enjoy it as a podcast on a daily basis,
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:13.180]  the same content.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.500]  Yep, yep.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.660]  Yeah, because version one was,
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:20.780]  I wanted to have it so you could listen to the,
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:23.000]  there's a Stratechery podcast now you can subscribe to,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.700]  but it's not a different price or a different subscription
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:26.960]  than the newsletter.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.660]  It's literally the same subscription.
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:30.780]  And the point is, you can either read it
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:32.260]  or you can listen to it.
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:37.180]  And it's funny, I think it'd be great for commutes,
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:39.860]  which is, I got a lot of requests about this, right?
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.680]  Whereas a 2,000 word email is a lot,
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:46.180]  whereas a 10 to 15 minute podcast is great
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:49.100]  and super easy to consume and fits in,
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.900]  in my commute and all those sorts of things.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:54.100]  The commute ended up working out,
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:57.540]  but it really resonated, I think.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:59.900]  The majority of people still read for sure,
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:02.900]  but the number of people that do the podcast
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:05.620]  is actually much higher than I expected.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:09.120]  And there's some aspect of podcasting,
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.220]  the great thing about email,
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:12.500]  what I figured out with Stratechery
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.700]  is people already check their email every day.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:18.700]  And so that was a great opportunity to put something there
[02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:20.280]  and you don't even have to download a new app
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.900]  or change the way, your habits or anything, right?
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:24.500]  But at the same time, when you're checking email,
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:25.700]  you're often very busy.
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:29.180]  And so you, oh, I have to read this big thing.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.340]  People gotta hear about building up
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:31.500]  and things on those lines.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:33.260]  Whereas because podcasts, you listen,
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.300]  you can do other stuff.
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:36.180]  You can drive a car, you can be in a subway,
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:37.580]  you can wash dishes.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:41.580]  And it made it an even more attractive place to be
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.940]  because you already check it.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:47.080]  And also there's more times to listen to it.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.060]  And so that was the daily update.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:52.300]  Like, well, if you do this, what if it was just a podcast?
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.380]  Right, and we've spoken about the benefits of email
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:57.900]  and the openness of email
[02:03:57.900 --> 02:04:01.120]  and the way that people can look forward to it.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.660]  But again, like you said, you don't know the context of it.
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.480]  Like one Monday I might get Stratechery
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.820]  and the next, the emails around it
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:10.100]  aren't really that interesting
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:13.940]  and I just click it and enjoy it and scroll and read.
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:17.460]  But you don't know, you as the publisher don't know if,
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:20.500]  for some subscribers, the very next email
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.440]  is an email from a colleague
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.260]  that says urgent server isn't responding, right?
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:26.260]  And it's like, guess what?
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:29.100]  They're gonna go right past Stratechery and go to that.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:30.660]  Not that they won't come back, right?
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:31.500]  It's like, that's not,
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:33.380]  everybody knows that's not how email works.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.880]  You can go back to it,
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:36.460]  but you don't know the context
[02:04:36.460 --> 02:04:37.580]  of how they're going to receive it.
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:40.020]  Whereas a podcast, you kind of do.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:42.320]  Like there might be other episodes of other shows,
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:45.660]  but you're not gonna get an email from a colleague
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.740]  saying there's an urgent fire in the office
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:52.060]  that needs to be put out right next to,
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:57.060]  hey, here's a new Stratechery.
[02:04:57.140 --> 02:04:58.740]  Right.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.560]  The other thing that,
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:01.780]  I've actually always thought people looked at me as,
[02:05:01.780 --> 02:05:03.620]  oh, I monetize my writing.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:07.620]  I wrote a piece a while ago when Grantland first shut down
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.900]  and it was called Grantland, the Future of Publishing.
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:11.860]  And I wrote what actually ended up
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:13.500]  being basically the Ringer business model,
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:17.420]  which is this idea of don't get stuck on sort of one medium
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:18.540]  because if you think about it,
[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:21.100]  podcasts are very good for monetization,
[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:22.820]  but they're not very good at being viral,
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.460]  not very good at spreading, right?
[02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.980]  Whereas text is very good at spreading
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:29.620]  and you can send, oh, forward an email to your friend
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:32.340]  or put a link on Twitter saying this is really great,
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.420]  post a screenshot.
[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:34.720]  And so it spreads very well.
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:39.180]  So it actually makes sense to use text to build an audience
[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:41.540]  and then use podcasts to monetize them.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:44.860]  And it's funny because I believe that was the right approach
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:46.420]  but I was actually doing the opposite
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:47.940]  where I had a free podcast,
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:51.300]  James Allworth, which continues.
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.420]  And that would help me sort of,
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:56.260]  I got my audience mostly through such a free post,
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:59.060]  but then sort of got them to know me better, et cetera,
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:00.060]  through a podcast.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:02.840]  Oh, and then I'll monetize through additional texts.
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:05.100]  But that was more a limitation of tools.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:07.620]  There weren't any tools to do
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:09.980]  the sort of podcast monetization.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.020]  And so I really wanted to build this
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:13.260]  for a very, very long time.
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:15.340]  And I actually started building something a year ago,
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:16.540]  but it was gonna be an app.
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:19.060]  And I quickly realized, no, an app is not the right,
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:21.740]  you don't wanna take someone,
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.620]  force them to go somewhere else.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:25.180]  You don't wanna be luminary for all intents and purposes.
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:28.860]  And so it made more, so I stopped it.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:32.140]  And then, oh, this idea of having this super easy way
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:34.380]  to add the feed into your podcast app,
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:36.700]  that's just like the daily update.
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.100]  People already check email,
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:39.740]  they already check their podcast apps.
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:41.740]  That's a much, that's the way to do it.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.460]  That is what makes much more sense.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:46.100]  And one of the things that certainly sold me on it
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:50.060]  is as you built it and I could see it at Stratechery,
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:53.940]  and I know how easy it was to sign up just for Stratechery,
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.560]  the selling point, one of the selling points for me,
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.700]  I mean, primarily it is do I think you and I
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:02.260]  could do a good show together?
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:05.460]  And of course, if I thought the answer was no,
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:06.740]  we wouldn't have been doing the show.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:09.260]  I thought, yes, this seems like a good pair
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:11.260]  of me and Ben could do this.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:12.280]  I would listen, right?
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.100]  That's the, for me is always the thing.
[02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:16.220]  I'm not, everything I do,
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:18.300]  everything I write at Daring Fireball,
[02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:20.620]  this show, Now Dithering,
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:22.500]  these are shows that I would listen to
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:23.700]  if there were two of me.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:25.360]  If there's one of me who's doing it
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:27.340]  and another one out there doing something else
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:29.100]  who's looking for podcasts to listen to,
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:30.460]  I would like the talk show.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:31.620]  I would love Dithering.
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:35.580]  I would definitely read Daring Fireball every day.
[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:39.100]  That's my audience, is somebody like me.
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:40.680]  And anybody who's similar enough
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.220]  that they also enjoy it, that's great.
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:43.480]  And I'm glad there's so many of them,
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:47.620]  but I have a, that's my target.
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.280]  But then at a technical level,
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:52.580]  am I willing to do something that's not,
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.020]  that requires a subscription?
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:56.340]  A big part of it is to me,
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:59.820]  how much friction is there to sign up?
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:01.820]  And it's not just are you willing to pay or not?
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:03.980]  That's obviously fundamental to the idea.
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:06.300]  And I have no hesitation for that
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:09.660]  in the same way that when I worked on the Vesper app
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:13.060]  with Brent Simmons and Dave Whiskus.
[02:08:13.060 --> 02:08:14.660]  Would I be willing to make an app
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:16.620]  that you have to pay $5 to use?
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.580]  Well, of course, yeah, I think that's a fair deal.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.380]  We make the app, you pay $5, you get it.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:24.060]  Am I willing to make a podcast you pay $5 a month for?
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.940]  Sure, definitely, that feels like a very fair deal
[02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:28.100]  for what we're doing.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.140]  But the experience has to be good, right?
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.960]  And it's like every time I see a tweet
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.580]  or get an email from somebody who says,
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:37.180]  hey, I signed up for dithering, easiest signup process
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:40.640]  I've ever done, it is like music to my ears.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:43.340]  It's funny because I'm with you.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:46.700]  I really believe in, I see nothing wrong.
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.340]  I actually know I've done nothing wrong.
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:50.720]  I absolutely endorse getting people to pay
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:53.660]  because it's a direct relationship with your customers.
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:55.300]  That's a much healthier place
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.220]  than having Google or Facebook sitting in the middle.
[02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:58.980]  So I'm super in favor of it.
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:08:59.820]  But at the end of the day,
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.880]  you're asking people to pay, right?
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:04.540]  So you should make everything else about the process
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.100]  as easy as possible.
[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:08.300]  And so with trajectory is like,
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:10.980]  well, am I going to have like DRM'd emails or something?
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:13.240]  No, because these people are paying you money.
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.780]  You want to make it super easy
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.740]  and they might forward to people and that's okay.
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:18.580]  Like that's just the price you pay
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:20.500]  because you want to make it super easy.
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:23.740]  And what's funny is I actually think that wed,
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:25.620]  I would say us, but it's mostly my mistake
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:27.700]  to make probably a mistake with dithering at first,
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:31.500]  which is like, okay, we made it really easy to add a feed,
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:33.360]  but even that's too much friction.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.300]  I want you to just be able to click a button
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.700]  and boom, you get the podcast.
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:38.460]  So we had this ability
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:41.060]  where if you already had this trajectory feed,
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:43.860]  it would suddenly start having the dithering podcast
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:44.700]  as well.
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:48.220]  And so like it almost crossed the line
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.580]  to being too frictionless,
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:50.640]  cause then it got confusing.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.740]  And we, what we realized is we had a standard
[02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:56.460]  and we want podcast players to support it, to split it out.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:57.500]  But that's actually,
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:09:59.940]  as you've learned with Markdown,
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:00.860]  getting in the world of standard
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:03.420]  it sounds like is just a recipe for a headache.
[02:10:03.420 --> 02:10:05.060]  So we kind of unwound that,
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.860]  but it was driven by the exact same idea,
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.100]  which is this needs to be as easy
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:10.700]  and frictionless as possible.
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:14.620]  And yeah, and the other thing too is we were fully aware
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.660]  that one of the things we're competing with
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:19.600]  are podcasts that don't have a subscription, right?
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.760]  Where you click a link for the RSS feed
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.540]  and it opens in your podcast player and you're there,
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:25.940]  or you're in your podcast player
[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:30.200]  and there's a search field and you type the talk show
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.220]  and hit return, then there it is and you can click it.
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:38.220]  You know, we're not inherently something subscription-based
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:40.780]  is going to involve a few more steps, right?
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:42.620]  The minimum, you have to give us your name,
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.620]  your email address, and pick a password,
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.700]  and a credit card number.
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.660]  And, but you know, we're not doing stuff like,
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:55.060]  oh, what industry do you work in?
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:57.300]  And you know, what are your interests
[02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:58.460]  and what are your hobbies?
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:10:59.980]  And this and that and the other thing.
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:03.340]  And all, you know, there's, it really is low friction.
[02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:04.900]  People are verifying it.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:06.140]  And then the other thing, you know,
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:09.580]  we should talk about is part of the reaction to dithering
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:12.780]  is that we don't have like free episodes to listen to.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:14.780]  There is no free trial.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.600]  And we thought about these things, you know,
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.220]  very, very significantly in the run up to it.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.460]  And we launched without it.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.880]  We're, for now, we don't have it.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.260]  One of the ideas as well,
[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:29.020]  you can listen to me and you together on this show.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:31.980]  And obviously the format's very different
[02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:33.420]  in terms of the length,
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:38.020]  but you can get a sense of the camaraderie we have together.
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:41.360]  We list the episodes on the dithering.fm website
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.720]  so you can see each show, what we are talking about,
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:47.060]  what the, you know, just that, you know,
[02:11:47.060 --> 02:11:48.220]  because that's one of the things people say is,
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:49.700]  well, what's the show about, you know,
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:52.580]  because the show, the website is minimal enough
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:55.300]  and really just sort of describes the periodicity.
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:58.300]  But you can, you know,
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:00.220]  part of it is I think people saying what's it about
[02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:02.840]  or being a little cute.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.180]  And part of it is.
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:05.520]  What else are we gonna talk about?
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.560]  Right.
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:09.380]  Well, people do wanna know if we're talking about sports.
[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.620]  That's right, which the answer is no,
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:14.740]  but that's mostly because sports don't exist right now.
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:16.220]  Just to be full disclosure.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:18.860]  Right, right now, it's like we might look back
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.180]  on this episode of, you know,
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:24.620]  and say, well, you know, it got off to a good launch.
[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:26.080]  The subscriber numbers are good.
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.380]  The reaction from people is, hey, I really like this.
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:29.340]  I love the format.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:30.420]  I'm really enjoying it.
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:34.560]  It's really, really overwhelmingly positive
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:36.740]  in a way that is very satisfying.
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:38.700]  We passed a 6,000 during recording,
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:39.720]  by the way, I just checked.
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:41.420]  Well, it's, you know, I think we literally
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:46.420]  were at 5,990, and no exaggeration, 5,999 before.
[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:48.760]  Yeah, when we started recording, yep.
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.460]  No, it's very gratifying.
[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:51.300]  It's successful.
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:53.460]  The feedback is good, but it's very possible
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:55.180]  that if there's one thing we're overlooking
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:58.960]  is that as the quarantine and the pandemic
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:01.300]  starts to dissipate and sports comes back,
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:04.160]  we might just derail the whole thing.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.140]  We're gonna ruin it.
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:07.300]  Right, and we're gonna look back and say,
[02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:10.460]  oh, the show was going great when there were no sports.
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:11.780]  And then we started talking about sports.
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.180]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden, and I was even mentioning,
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:17.380]  one of the things I've mentioned is that,
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:19.380]  look, it's five bucks a month to start,
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:21.820]  and you can go monthly for five bucks.
[02:13:21.820 --> 02:13:24.660]  It gets you access to all of the shows we've already done,
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:26.820]  which I think is over 25 already,
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:29.220]  and you can listen to those.
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:31.860]  And if you don't like it, it's like you're two clicks away
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:35.700]  from unsubscribing, and you're only out five bucks,
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.820]  and that's it.
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:39.580]  And it doesn't seem like anybody's doing it,
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:42.120]  and who knows, maybe once the NBA starts back,
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.540]  and baseball starts up, it's all of a sudden,
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:48.760]  instead of watching the subscriber number go up,
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:50.060]  it's gonna start going down.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:51.680]  But I don't think it's gonna happen.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.560]  Well, the other thing about this,
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.620]  I mean, we're also limited technically right now.
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.700]  So we actually do have it that,
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.940]  because it's funny, when you do something new,
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:04.260]  you run into all these assumptions that other people made
[02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:05.740]  that are unexpected, right?
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:09.420]  So podcasts, one of the things, if you look at our page,
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:11.700]  we had different show art in different months,
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:13.500]  in March and April and May,
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.340]  and if you actually go back and you play our podcast
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:18.180]  in those months, you have that show art come up
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:20.540]  from the MP3, but none of the podcast apps
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:22.420]  actually list the right show art
[02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:26.220]  because they just assume a show always has the same art.
[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.600]  And there's all sorts of cases where you run into this.
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:33.120]  One of these is the membership software
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.660]  just never really thought about there being
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:37.620]  multiple free plans, because it was a subscription product.
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:40.340]  And so there's actually not really a means
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:42.420]  to do the free thing right now,
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:45.140]  but that's also what's been so fun about building this,
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:49.340]  is I sort of paraphrase that Alan Kay's statement,
[02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:50.460]  anyone that's serious about software
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.860]  needs to build their own hardware.
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:53.860]  In this case, it's like, anyone serious about publishing
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:54.980]  needs to build their own software.
[02:14:54.980 --> 02:14:56.740]  It's like kind of moving in a different direction
[02:14:56.740 --> 02:15:00.180]  in the stack, but to explore the different things
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.420]  that you can do and are possible.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:04.220]  And so I think it'll be fun.
[02:15:04.220 --> 02:15:05.820]  We can see this evolve, I think,
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.140]  potentially over time as well.
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:09.320]  I mean, there's still some cool features,
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.840]  like if your credit card expires,
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:13.340]  you will get a podcast telling you
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.740]  your credit card's expired, right?
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:17.060]  Which makes sense, because you're not checking the website,
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:18.580]  you're not checking email, it's a podcast.
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:20.060]  Why would you expect anywhere else?
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:22.860]  So how can we meet you where you are?
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:26.180]  And it's really fun and invigorating
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:29.260]  to sort of think through that opportunity,
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:33.740]  that experience, and how you can really make it as easy
[02:15:33.740 --> 02:15:35.580]  and make people feel like they're getting
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:36.500]  what they're paying for, right?
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.980]  Part of that is making it a great experience.
[02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:41.300]  Part of it is being super consistent, right?
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:43.100]  You're getting 45 minutes a week,
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.720]  in three 15-minute episodes.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:47.100]  It's like, it might be a three-hour podcast,
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.040]  might be a 30-minute, no, it is what it is.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.820]  And I don't know, it's been very invigorating
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:53.360]  for me, definitely.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:55.740]  Yeah, and that's, it's a sort of cleverness
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.940]  that I don't think anybody's experienced yet,
[02:15:57.940 --> 02:15:59.740]  because I think it's still so fresh,
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:02.940]  we're only 20 days in since announcing,
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:05.820]  and so, or maybe even less than that,
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.820]  so nobody's credit card's expired yet,
[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:10.940]  so they haven't, nobody's gotten the podcast episode
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:13.420]  that will pop into their feed reader and say,
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:18.420]  hey, your dithering credit card has expired,
[02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.900]  go to the dithering to renew, or whatever.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:22.380]  No, link in your show notes, yeah.
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.420]  Right, link in your show notes.
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:25.340]  You can just do it right there in your podcast app.
[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:27.380]  I've told you this, it's a funny story,
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:29.140]  is back in the day, and one of the reasons
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:31.420]  it's such an interesting thing is I,
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:33.260]  without going into depth about it,
[02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:37.620]  because we talked about it on Stratechery last week,
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:39.200]  I'll put a link in the show notes,
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.500]  people can sign up and listen to that for free.
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:44.480]  But in the history of Daring Fireball,
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:48.540]  I had custom RSS feeds for people who paid
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:52.400]  an annual membership fee, and you got full content
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.940]  RSS feeds for Daring Fireball,
[02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:58.820]  and people who didn't pay got just the top-level
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.200]  excerpt of the article, and you had to go
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:01.740]  to my website to read it.
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.100]  And everybody, it was sort of similar,
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:06.740]  where everybody got their own personal URL,
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:10.860]  it was like, you know, daringfireball.net slash feeds slash,
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:13.300]  and then like a unique token.
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.900]  And I built in a thing that said that if,
[02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:18.380]  you know, if their year membership was up
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:20.860]  and it was time to renew, they got a custom item,
[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.620]  and it would address them by name,
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:24.620]  and it would say like, you know, Ben Thompson,
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:28.420]  you know, your membership to Daring Fireball has expired.
[02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:31.440]  And I thought, boy, that's clever, won't that be neat,
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:33.180]  and people who, you know, because I thought,
[02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:34.980]  you know, my idea was, hey, you could,
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:37.100]  you don't have to ever go to my website again,
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:39.460]  maybe you love your feed reader so much,
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.980]  once you have the feed, you'll just stay in the feed reader.
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:43.320]  Well, here's how I'll let you know
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.400]  that your membership has expired,
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:47.340]  with a custom thing just for you.
[02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:51.340]  Well, the thing I didn't anticipate was that people,
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.700]  let's say somebody signed up,
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:57.220]  and for 11 months of daily reading of Daring Fireball,
[02:17:57.220 --> 02:17:58.880]  everything that showed up in that feed
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:01.720]  was something I had posted to the tens of thousands
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.540]  of people reading Daring Fireball.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:04.860]  And then all of a sudden, one day,
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:09.340]  their name is in what looks to be the headline
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:12.340]  mentioning that they had let their membership expire.
[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:13.780]  And they thought it was on the public site.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.100]  Yeah, that I was shaming them
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:18.980]  in front of the entire Daring Fireball audience
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:22.340]  for having let their membership expire.
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:23.860]  And I got a couple of emails like that,
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:25.020]  and they were always very nice,
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:26.260]  and they weren't like outraged,
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:28.660]  because they, of course, it took them seconds
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:30.820]  to realize what was going on,
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:34.460]  but they did have like a momentary, you know, flock.
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:36.740]  Yeah, and so I rewrote the message.
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.060]  I forget what I did exactly,
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:40.420]  but I did something to try to clarify it,
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:43.060]  you know, like put something in brackets in front,
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:45.340]  like the way that I flagged like a sponsorship message
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:49.060]  or something to make it clear that it was just for them,
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:50.520]  because I hadn't anticipated it.
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.360]  And I thought-
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:52.180]  No, it's a good call.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:53.260]  I feel like I should go back and do that now
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:54.100]  for our podcast,
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:55.680]  because that's probably gonna happen to someone.
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.840]  They're like, wait, is this in the whole feed?
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:59.220]  Right, and like the handful of people
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:01.180]  who wrote to me about it always said the same thing,
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:03.260]  which is that, you know, once you think about it,
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:05.800]  it would, you know, I subscribe to your site,
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:07.140]  I'm a member because I know you,
[02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:08.940]  and I trust you, and, you know,
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:13.940]  it seemed very out of character for you to do this,
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:16.980]  but still it was quite a shock to see my name
[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:18.520]  in the headline field.
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:20.740]  That's amazing.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:22.180]  Your membership has expired.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.180]  You're a cheapskate.
[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:28.220]  I mean, it's fun though, because like,
[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.900]  if everyone, like you, everyone has a custom RSV,
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:34.100]  like it doesn't, they don't need to all be the same.
[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:36.380]  There's so much, there's so much potential here.
[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.260]  And again, it's like,
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:39.100]  But you know what though?
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:40.140]  You know what people are gonna ask for?
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:42.820]  They're gonna ask for a checkbox for sports.
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.540]  Yeah, well, it's funny, I do wanna build that for the,
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:47.380]  because Anshu Shekari, I've been doing
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.820]  just the daily updates where I read them,
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:50.420]  but I've been doing more and more interviews,
[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:51.260]  because it's like, well,
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.020]  I used to do interviews occasionally,
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:54.460]  but you transcribe the whole thing,
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:56.080]  and it's hard, reading an interview transcription
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.580]  can be very difficult.
[02:19:57.580 --> 02:19:58.820]  Whereas once I had the podcast,
[02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:00.500]  well, they could go listen to the podcast,
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:02.980]  so it made me want to do more of them.
[02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:04.220]  But then now I have people that are like,
[02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:07.380]  oh, I actually want the podcast only for the interviews.
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:08.740]  But so that's actually something we're gonna build.
[02:20:08.740 --> 02:20:10.060]  Like it's not done yet,
[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:12.380]  but you'll be able to check, click a checkbox
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:13.680]  and say, I want this, want that.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:15.380]  I don't think you'll get that for dithering.
[02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:17.360]  I'm just gonna put a stake in the ground right now.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.020]  But yes, we will continue our descriptive,
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.220]  our descriptive, maybe we can do chapters.
[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.640]  I'm okay with chapters.
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:28.860]  But oh, one thing you just said,
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:30.580]  but people might just be in their feed reader
[02:20:30.580 --> 02:20:32.140]  and never visit the site.
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:34.660]  That's, I think that that is like the core, like dithering.
[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:36.920]  Like dithering is like the realization of that vision, right?
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:38.780]  Dithering is not a website.
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:42.860]  Dithering is something that lives in your podcast player.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:44.020]  We don't have any expectation.
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.100]  You come back to see us, come back and visit us.
[02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:47.860]  It's all in that MP3 player.
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:48.980]  And you can, there's a link there
[02:20:48.980 --> 02:20:50.380]  if you want to manage your subscription.
[02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:54.000]  But even then, it's like coming from the MP3 itself
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.640]  and really leaning into this idea that it's like,
[02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:00.380]  it's not centralized at all.
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:02.900]  It's fully sort of like distributed.
[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:04.460]  It's a distributed product in the way
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:06.700]  that sort of the openness makes possible.
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:10.740]  Yeah, it just is native to podcasts and your podcast app
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:14.340]  in a way that is, to me, very pure.
[02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:17.580]  It is very pure to the medium of podcasting.
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:21.020]  Anyway, my suggestion, I thank all of you
[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:22.640]  who do listen to this show.
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:25.040]  But I think that if you enjoy me and Ben together,
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:26.740]  you have a very high likelihood
[02:21:26.740 --> 02:21:28.800]  that you would also enjoy dithering.
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.300]  I definitely encourage you to sign up.
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.840]  And I'll just emphasize, it's only five bucks a month
[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:35.100]  to start, see if you like it.
[02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.260]  And it's super easy to cancel if you don't.
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:42.260]  And you know, I think you'll like it.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:45.660]  Yeah, and hey, head us up for a refund if you really hate it.
[02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:50.280]  Yeah, the other thing is my big concern starting this
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:52.460]  was, okay, I mean, how many times a year
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:54.780]  do you think you're on the talk show traditionally?
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:56.180]  Probably three, two or three?
[02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.420]  Yeah, I'd say one or two.
[02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:01.460]  When someone did a count, I realized I'd been actually
[02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:03.580]  one of the most frequent guests.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:06.340]  But I guess, but then I realized I'd been doing
[02:22:06.340 --> 02:22:08.180]  Sir Techery for seven years.
[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:10.580]  It's amazing how fast time flies.
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:13.500]  But you know, but a concern was, well, wait,
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:17.200]  if I do a show 45 minutes a week with Ben,
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.160]  am I ever gonna have anything to talk about
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:20.460]  on the talk show?
[02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:22.940]  Or vice versa, if he comes on the talk show
[02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:26.780]  and he's on for two hours, are we gonna run out of stuff
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:27.980]  to talk about for Dithering?
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:30.420]  And I feel like so far, so good.
[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:33.040]  I feel like, all right, we talked about the show itself
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.340]  and the Rogan thing and whatever.
[02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:37.060]  I still have a long list of stuff to talk about
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:39.120]  on Dithering tomorrow night.
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.540]  Oh, a huge list.
[02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:42.220]  Because we actually, we started to do the Rogan thing
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:43.940]  on Dithering yesterday, and it's like, wait,
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:46.620]  we could talk about podcasting in general
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:50.100]  and Joe Rogan and the Howard Stern angle for hours.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.940]  This should obviously be a talk show episode.
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:57.300]  So yeah, no, it's actually worked out.
[02:22:57.300 --> 02:22:59.180]  Yeah, I mean, we'll see how it goes.
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:00.680]  But we're a couple months in.
[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:04.620]  The great thing too is, you know,
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:06.840]  I thought about the same angle from Shrekari, right?
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:09.400]  Is it gonna be too much overlap, et cetera, et cetera?
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:14.400]  It turns out because like Shrekari can be very dense, right?
[02:23:14.540 --> 02:23:18.060]  It's like every sentence, ideally it's 2,000 words long,
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:20.920]  but almost every sentence is like progressing
[02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:24.980]  a logical argument and like very like constantly, right?
[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:27.140]  And so people give me this feedback like,
[02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:28.940]  oh, I feel like I have to be in a certain state of mind
[02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:30.780]  or certain place to like consume it.
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:31.620]  And I'm like, that's fine.
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:33.460]  That's the product that I do.
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:34.940]  That's totally different than Dithering.
[02:23:34.940 --> 02:23:37.220]  Like Dithering is like, it's all about the back and forth.
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.300]  It's conversation.
[02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.220]  Yes, I still get geeky and analytical,
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:42.020]  but it's balanced by you telling stories
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:43.140]  about changing your kids' diapers.
[02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:45.660]  So it ends up working out very well.
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:50.580]  All right, my thanks to our sponsors this week.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:51.420]  Linode.
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:53.280]  That was a hint at what to expect.
[02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:57.220]  Yes, please, coffee, which I just finished.
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:58.720]  I probably didn't need to drink the whole pot.
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:02.020]  And our good friends at Squarespace.
