[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  Craig, it felt like six months is a good time to check it out.
[00:03.920 --> 00:06.880]  Yeah, it's been a hell of a six months. Yeah.
[00:06.880 --> 00:12.560]  Let's have an anniversary. This is our bi-annual Twitter anniversary.
[00:12.560 --> 00:16.960]  Isn't bi-annual is one of those words like bi-weekly, bi-monthly.
[00:18.080 --> 00:18.720]  I never know.
[00:20.400 --> 00:22.560]  Is it mean twice or every other?
[00:22.560 --> 00:28.560]  I think it's one of those literal holes in the English language where it means both.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.200]  Like bi-annual means like every six months and it means every two years.
[00:33.200 --> 00:35.440]  Yeah. It's like you pick it up out of context.
[00:36.720 --> 00:40.960]  Yeah. There's all sorts of funny entire books written about the oddities of the English
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.760]  language, but that's one that has to be considered a bug. But anyway, we're doing it six months.
[00:45.760 --> 00:47.280]  I don't want to wait two years.
[00:47.280 --> 00:53.520]  Yeah. Well, yeah. Whatever we're going to call it may not be around in two years.
[00:53.520 --> 01:00.560]  Yeah. When last you were on in January, the wounds were fresh, Elon Musk.
[01:00.560 --> 01:04.320]  Well, and I believe we spent the whole episode not calling them out by name.
[01:04.320 --> 01:08.000]  You're certainly free to call them phony Stark or...
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.160]  Yeah. I've already thought of that.
[01:10.160 --> 01:14.880]  What was Charles Foster Musk I came up with this week I thought was pretty good?
[01:14.880 --> 01:20.640]  Well, I always thought the CF stood for clusterfuck. Charles Foster.
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.520]  Yeah. Yeah. And it fits! Clusterfuck Musk.
[01:26.560 --> 01:28.880]  Oh, this is right. This is a PG-rated show.
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.120]  No, not really. It's been a while since anybody's complained. I feel like what happened...
[01:33.760 --> 01:35.680]  The profanity is pretty low. There was a...
[01:35.680 --> 01:39.440]  Yeah. Yeah. And if it's in context, it's fine.
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.320]  Well, but there was a thing... You know what's funny as you get older?
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.800]  I... Everything seems like it was just a couple of years ago and it was probably like 10 years ago.
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.840]  I don't know. But at some point early on in this incarnation of my podcast,
[01:56.560 --> 02:02.240]  I got a very, very friendly, very friendly note from somebody at Apple Podcasts,
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.240]  truly friendly. And I think it speaks to my sort of weird, unique stature in the Apple world.
[02:08.240 --> 02:11.680]  Maybe some other podcasts wouldn't have gotten the hands-on treatment I got,
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.640]  but that they had gotten just a handful, they said, of comments from people saying that they
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.400]  were playing my podcast in their car and the kids were there and there were some curse words.
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.760]  And that if... I just need, per episode, an explicit tag. And if I needed help
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.000]  figuring out the RSS syntax, I was like, I got it. I know. Okay.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:31.440 --> 02:33.440]  And they were like, yeah, I thought you did. But I actually...
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.000]  It's only.
[02:35.280 --> 02:40.800]  Yeah. But anyway, how are you feeling about it? The wounds were fresh in January. Now,
[02:40.800 --> 02:47.520]  it's... I feel like the scabs are gone. The wound's healing. I mean, what do you...
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.960]  Yeah. I mean, I'm glad it's all behind us. I mean, it really is. And once we got through the whole
[02:52.960 --> 02:58.160]  refund thing and everything, I mean, it's been a pretty serious hit to our software income.
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.720]  Roughly about a third of our income just disappeared. So that's something that we're
[03:04.720 --> 03:12.640]  dealing with and it makes me nervous. To be honest, the thing that we love is in danger.
[03:15.120 --> 03:19.200]  But I think it's kind of playing out how I thought it would play out.
[03:21.840 --> 03:29.840]  It's surprising how extreme it has gotten. But yeah, I concluded that original blog post
[03:29.840 --> 03:36.400]  saying that it was going to become a $44 billion version of MySpace, which is kind of on that
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.880]  trajectory. Well, there has to be a part of you. Again, it was like when I had Christian
[03:40.880 --> 03:45.600]  Seelig on a couple of episodes ago. I love that episode, by the way. That was really great.
[03:45.600 --> 03:54.560]  Well, honestly, just hats off to him, really. Honestly, to me, as a lesson in the attitude
[03:54.560 --> 04:03.040]  to face adversity with it just blows my mind. But his upbeat attitude in the face of effectively
[04:03.040 --> 04:09.920]  100% loss for his business in software, I would not 100 because he's got the Pixel Pal's side app,
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.760]  but certainly large majority, right? Yeah. Again, I don't even mean to laugh with you guys.
[04:16.720 --> 04:22.800]  You're talking about a third of icon factory software business just zapped away. But it's
[04:22.800 --> 04:30.160]  part of you has to be thinking, well, the upside is at least he just ripped the bandaid off and
[04:30.160 --> 04:37.120]  it was over and it was as tumultuous it was as as bad as it is financially. At least you're out of
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.560]  it. Whereas if this was still this sort of demacules was still hanging over your head,
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.440]  if he hadn't done it six months ago, you'd still be thinking he'd do it any moment. Right?
[04:47.440 --> 04:55.200]  And I was always thought initially, yeah, right. Let's just say he had waited another year or nine
[04:55.200 --> 04:59.920]  months or seven months. But what if he did it next month or something like that, instead of
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.120]  at the end of last year? This would not have been a very good six months to have been a Twitter
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.240]  developer, even if being a Twitter app developer, we're still a thing, right? Well, look, we'll look
[05:10.240 --> 05:15.520]  at the instability API, right? Right. And it's like you were complaining the other day about
[05:15.520 --> 05:21.920]  your your tweet thingy. Yeah, right. And it just stops working. Right. And you have no idea why.
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.640]  And you have nobody you can contact as well. Why is it not working? And, yeah, the thing that cracks
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.880]  me up is these people are paying forty two thousand dollars a month for API access. You don't
[05:30.880 --> 05:38.480]  get any support. All right. So so let me let me fill listeners in on this. It will take too long.
[05:38.480 --> 05:45.520]  But I have I wrote my 10, 12, 15 years ago, I wrote my own little script that I run on my
[05:45.520 --> 05:51.680]  server is every five minutes. It's a cron job. And the at Daring Fireball Twitter account
[05:52.240 --> 05:57.760]  gets posts. And the script is very simple. It's I shouldn't write any programs, frankly,
[05:57.760 --> 06:04.560]  but I enjoy it as a hobby. And the script is very simple. It reads my RSS feed actually reads the
[06:04.560 --> 06:11.440]  Jason feed. But now I've but regardless, it's like RSS. And every five minutes, it says, hey,
[06:11.440 --> 06:17.440]  are there any new articles? Oh, here's one format into a tweet, post the tweet,
[06:18.160 --> 06:23.760]  and keep a log of all the ones that have already been tweeted so it doesn't tweet them again.
[06:23.760 --> 06:31.360]  And then wait five minutes and check again. And it I've I've been playing with the script for
[06:31.360 --> 06:36.480]  months because I updated it a couple months ago to cross post to Mastodon. In addition,
[06:37.040 --> 06:44.640]  I have at Daring Fireball at Mastodon social. But a couple of months ago, Twitter said that this is
[06:44.640 --> 06:50.080]  nothing to do the the clients thing for Twitter rific and tweet bot and all the other Twitter,
[06:50.080 --> 06:56.240]  tweet, Twitter clients like that you use that was at the end of last year, that was six months ago.
[06:56.240 --> 07:02.400]  But in April, they just for people writing bots and other type of tools, anything else that uses
[07:02.400 --> 07:08.000]  the Twitter API, they're like, you have to pay. And I'm like, well, I'm not gonna pay. I mean,
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.400]  to hell with this. And that's what that was most people's reaction, right? I'm not paying for this.
[07:12.400 --> 07:17.600]  And lo and behold, my script stopped working. And I didn't know what to do. And then a couple of
[07:17.600 --> 07:23.120]  weeks later, I didn't do anything. It just started working again. Like they turned the API points back
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.720]  on. And, and there's some kind of free tier that I'd currently at. And the limit is like 50 tweets
[07:30.720 --> 07:37.680]  a day and a 1500 total a month because what 50 times 30 is 1500. Yeah. So it's like,
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.920]  yeah, you're way under the limits. Yeah. Right. I don't know what the busiest day in Daring
[07:43.920 --> 07:50.160]  Fireball history is. But it's got to be like 10 posts or something like that. Not 50. So
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.880]  it's no worries. And even if I did post 51 items in a day, it would just wait till next tomorrow,
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.800]  it would be able to, some of them just wouldn't be posted when they're fresh, regardless.
[08:00.800 --> 08:05.040]  Well, and people would say, oh, it's a busy day on Daring Fireball. I'm just gonna go to the website.
[08:05.040 --> 08:10.160]  Right. Right. You can just figure it out. But yeah, yeah. If I post, once I get to around 48,
[08:10.160 --> 08:16.800]  49 posts, people might want to start checking on me. I'm a little worried about John, you know.
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.920]  Too much coffee.
[08:17.920 --> 08:24.240]  Yeah, too much coffee. Anyway, about midway through this month, July, I didn't even notice.
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.200]  This speaks to when my script stopped working in April, I noticed right away and people told me
[08:29.200 --> 08:34.320]  this time it stopped working. I started getting it, but I didn't even notice until like a week
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.680]  later and nobody sent me anything. Or if they did, I didn't notice it because maybe it was on Twitter,
[08:39.680 --> 08:46.320]  which I'm not, I'm still there. I haven't left Twitter. I just check it far less frequently
[08:46.320 --> 08:52.000]  because I check Mastodon first. I'm using Blue Sky. I'm using Threads a lot. And Twitter is
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.640]  last on that list now. It just is. And it's not a political protest. It's just what I find useful
[08:58.640 --> 09:06.480]  for my time. Anyway, I just want to finish this story. I was like, well, what happened? Why did
[09:06.480 --> 09:13.360]  my script stop working now? I'm using their version 1.1 API in my script. And they said that
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.080]  that was going away, but they said that was going away months ago. But now when I log in, it says,
[09:18.080 --> 09:28.080]  my free tier has access to these 1.1 endpoints and these version 2.0 API endpoints. And in the 1.1
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.760]  endpoints is sending a new tweet. So, according to their developer docs, it should still work.
[09:35.120 --> 09:42.720]  But it is... It's a mystery. It's a real mystery. It's in a mystery since January
[09:42.720 --> 09:45.760]  18th or whatever. I forget. Was it the 18th or the 21st?
[09:45.760 --> 09:51.680]  Right. But you literally can't find... They have this whole site developed... Well,
[09:51.680 --> 09:55.360]  it's funny that it's still called developer.Twitter.com. It's not updated.
[09:56.320 --> 09:59.840]  But they have a whole site... There's like one guy from Twitter posting there.
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.760]  And it's actually funny that you can... There's nowhere... They have a blog. They have
[10:05.760 --> 10:12.800]  like developer.Twitter.com slash blog. Their last post is October of 2022. So,
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.360]  literally before he bought... I guess he fired everybody who ran the developer blog.
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.960]  All the support people were the first to go.
[10:19.520 --> 10:20.240]  Yeah, right.
[10:20.240 --> 10:24.160]  Developer relations, support, that just was like, yeah, we don't need them.
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.280]  Right. And so there's...
[10:25.280 --> 10:26.000]  Turns out you do.
[10:27.680 --> 10:34.320]  My best... My working theory is that they've finally turned off the 1.1 endpoints.
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.440]  And I have to update my script to the version 2.0 once, which I don't think will be too much work.
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.560]  But you can't find a straight answer. And the funniest part, the very funniest part,
[10:44.560 --> 10:47.840]  is that when you go to the forums... Because that's one of the... When you run into a problem
[10:47.840 --> 10:51.120]  like this, the first thing you want to do is find... Is it just me or...
[10:51.120 --> 10:54.080]  It's anybody else. Yeah. Is anybody else getting hit by this? Yeah.
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.080]  Lots of other people are getting hit by this. And the funniest part is that a bunch of them
[10:58.080 --> 11:00.960]  are paying like tens of thousands of dollars.
[11:00.960 --> 11:09.280]  Exactly. Right. The people that are in the deep pockets, right, have the same experience as the
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.640]  guy who's just using the free tier, right? Which is shit.
[11:12.640 --> 11:20.080]  Professional, full-time employees of big, big companies who are... It's people with their real
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.880]  names, not some anonymous script kitty or whatever you call them anymore. These are just professionals
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.480]  looking for an answer who are saying, my company pays $20,000 a month for API access. And I'm like,
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.760]  well, why are they paying that kind of money for API access? Because it's support systems and
[11:35.760 --> 11:40.400]  things like that. Companies found that Twitter was a good way to do interactions with their
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.560]  customers, right? And that's a big impact for these people, right? If that breaks,
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.840]  and you can't reply to some customer, and you're paying $42K a month for that,
[11:51.840 --> 11:59.120]  or $10K a month, there's a bunch of different tiers. It's like, it's stupid. It's just dumb.
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.080]  It's just dumb all around. It is just incredibly dumb. And just the arrogance is just off the
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.400]  charts. I sent you a link. I mean, as we talked, we're what, one week, I guess it was a week ago
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.760]  tonight when he's just declared by Fiat that they'd be changing the name from Twitter to X.
[12:18.960 --> 12:26.240]  It's been obviously not the smoothest renaming transition. I sent you a link at their
[12:26.240 --> 12:29.920]  headquarters. They still haven't taken down the Twitter side on the side of this.
[12:29.920 --> 12:35.280]  Well, it's half disassembled, partially disassembled. It's like the service,
[12:35.280 --> 12:44.640]  right? It's just hanging on. So the old Twitter sign is half down. It still says
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.040]  ER because while they were taking it down, the San Francisco police came to check if they had
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.320]  a permit and of course they didn't. And so they said, well, then you got to stop. So they just
[12:56.320 --> 13:03.920]  stopped. Still haven't finished that, but somehow they got rid of the twit, but not really.
[13:06.080 --> 13:13.440]  They have erected a giant X on top of the building. Now the old Twitter sign was like on
[13:14.320 --> 13:19.120]  the corner of the building. It used to be like a clock or something too, wasn't it?
[13:19.120 --> 13:25.440]  Yeah. It was kind of a bit of a landmark and they worked with the city to make it nice.
[13:25.440 --> 13:32.560]  Yeah, it was nice. Doug Bowman at stop on Twitter. Now he's on threads. I forget what his title was,
[13:32.560 --> 13:38.160]  but he ran design for Twitter a while back. Stop Design was his blog back in the day.
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.800]  I've known him for a long time, but he had a very nice thread on threads talking about the sign
[13:44.800 --> 13:51.440]  and because he led the design of it and how much care they put into it. And he was sad to see it
[13:51.440 --> 13:56.160]  taken down. It really was that sign was something that they spent a lot of time trying to make
[13:56.160 --> 14:02.160]  right. They wanted to do right by their brand, right by their company, but also right by the
[14:02.160 --> 14:08.800]  city of San Francisco because 10th and Market is a big corner. Very, very busy part of San
[14:08.800 --> 14:12.560]  Francisco if you've never seen it. Yeah, historic part of the city.
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.600]  Yeah, very much so. If you've never been to San Francisco, it's right. You almost can't miss it
[14:17.600 --> 14:26.560]  if you're downtown. Anyway, now they're putting a giant X on top of the building and it flashes it.
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.560]  Man, does it? It flashes and I'm telling you, I'll put this in the making a note. I'm going to put
[14:32.560 --> 14:38.080]  it. Yeah, you got to see it to believe it. You think you think, Oh, this is just a flashing sign,
[14:38.080 --> 14:45.440]  right? I would say they're using some kind of LED technology that heretofore has only been used in
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.320]  Las Vegas, maybe. It's probably a bunch of Tesla headlights,
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.600]  right? You just went to the factories. Hey, give me a bunch of headlights.
[14:53.600 --> 14:59.920]  Well, it looks like the type of lights that you would put to signal alien civilizations.
[14:59.920 --> 15:05.760]  You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder if you can see it from space.
[15:05.760 --> 15:10.080]  They have contact with the station to say, Hey guys, can you see it?
[15:10.080 --> 15:19.040]  Yeah, it is extremely bright, but it doesn't just turn on. It flashes like the lights in a nightclub.
[15:19.040 --> 15:25.520]  I mean, like strobe lights for lack of, extremely bright. And what is directly across the street
[15:25.520 --> 15:33.360]  from the sign? It is a high rise apartment building. And somebody, the tweet I will put
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.160]  in the show notes is somebody saying, Oh my God, could you imagine living across the street from
[15:38.160 --> 15:45.040]  this? And it's video of this incredibly bright strobe light. And, and then the next word livid
[15:45.040 --> 15:51.120]  was mentioned as well, right? The next tweet is the guy retweeting somebody who says, yeah,
[15:51.120 --> 15:58.720]  this is my life. And it's somebody who lives in the building. Oh, Jesus. Showing what it looks
[15:58.720 --> 16:04.800]  like. Of course, I didn't see that reply. You know why? Oh, because I'm not locked into Twitter.
[16:04.800 --> 16:09.280]  Oh yeah. So they show these videos, right? And then, and it's like, there's all this
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.680]  context around it, which is always the conversation. That's what Twitter was about,
[16:13.680 --> 16:18.000]  right? The conversation. And if you're not logged into Twitter, you see none of that.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.080]  Yeah. Well, one of the reasons I spent so little time on it, again, not protesting it,
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.320]  even though the people who are, I think look like the smart ones, but not out of protest,
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.920]  but just out of, well, this isn't even worth my time. Is that when you are logged in, the,
[16:34.800 --> 16:40.880]  the prioritization of people who pay for Twitter blue, and it still is called Twitter blue.
[16:40.880 --> 16:48.400]  It's not X blue yet. Twitter blue get, or at the top of all the replies always to get that.
[16:48.400 --> 16:52.960]  I mean, they, they even, it's not like a secret. That's, that's like a reason that they want you
[16:52.960 --> 17:00.320]  to sign up for blue. So no matter what tweet you look at it, that the top replies are always from
[17:00.320 --> 17:07.600]  the blue check marks and they are the most obnoxious people, you know, mostly, yeah,
[17:07.600 --> 17:14.480]  they really are there. I mean, one of them, so, so the only reason that the reply with the guy's
[17:14.480 --> 17:21.440]  video from his bedroom or whatever it is across the street is because the same guy retweeted it.
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.200]  So because it was his original post, his replies boost. Yeah. Right. But all the,
[17:27.200 --> 17:33.920]  all the next replies in that thread are like people saying literally, can you imagine living
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.960]  in a city and complaining about lights? Like, ha ha, you know, like what, what idiots you are
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.640]  to complain about this. I trust me that, that this is not normal lights in a, in a city.
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.480]  Yeah, no, anybody who's lived in the city looks at that and just says, no,
[17:48.480 --> 17:52.400]  that's just obnoxious. Well, I'm sure. That's the thing about living in a city,
[17:52.400 --> 17:55.840]  right? You're actually more in tune with the people around you.
[17:55.840 --> 17:57.920]  Right, you are. Because there are a lot of them.
[17:57.920 --> 18:02.880]  Yeah, you kind of develop an innate sense of conscientiousness in terms of noise.
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.960]  Like walking on the right side of the street, right? You can always tell people that they're
[18:06.960 --> 18:09.600]  from out of town, right? They don't follow the walking rules.
[18:09.600 --> 18:12.800]  Right, they don't follow the walking rules, including, including pace.
[18:12.800 --> 18:19.040]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's like, you're just kind of, you're, you, you, you fall in, right?
[18:20.160 --> 18:23.920]  I don't know what else before we, I mean, there's not much, it's not worth spending too much time.
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.320]  Oh, that, well, I showed you that how to X document yesterday that you should probably link
[18:30.320 --> 18:37.120]  to that in the show notes. But just for grins, I went through and, and took their how to tweet
[18:37.120 --> 18:44.560]  a document from their health center and changed all the tweets and Twitters to X. And it's,
[18:44.560 --> 18:47.760]  your comment was good. It's like, it felt like Mad Libs.
[18:47.760 --> 18:48.160]  Yes.
[18:48.160 --> 18:49.760]  You know, fill in the blank.
[18:50.320 --> 18:54.480]  Yeah. It feels like every time you get to an X, you're supposed to fill it in with a funny word.
[18:54.480 --> 19:04.160]  Yeah, it's like, how to whatever. And it's just, it was just, it's, step one,
[19:04.160 --> 19:09.280]  type your X up to 280 characters into the compose box at the top of your home timeline,
[19:09.280 --> 19:16.480]  or select X button in the navigation bar. You can include up to four photos, a GIF, a video
[19:16.480 --> 19:24.800]  in your X. Select the X button to post the X to your profile. What does that even mean?
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.440]  Yeah. Speaking of profanity and Mad Libs, I will tell you one of the, you ever,
[19:29.440 --> 19:35.280]  you ever just have one of those things where it's something cracks you up so, so tremendously that
[19:35.280 --> 19:40.960]  you remember it decades later as one of the funniest moments of your life. At some point
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.480]  in the nineties, I mean, like, I don't know, 1997, 1998, I even remember where we are.
[19:46.480 --> 19:48.400]  And my wife remembers where we were.
[19:48.400 --> 19:49.440]  They always do.
[19:49.440 --> 19:55.040]  We were driving out on City Line Avenue in Philadelphia. People who live here know that
[19:55.040 --> 20:04.240]  it's called City Line because it's a part of the city where one side of the street is still the
[20:04.240 --> 20:10.720]  city of Philadelphia. And the other side is the suburbs, a suburb called Balikinwood. And you can
[20:10.720 --> 20:18.400]  tell which side is which because the city of Philadelphia has like a 5% wage tax and Balikinwood
[20:18.400 --> 20:26.000]  does not. And so the city of Philadelphia side is all like Taco Bell and Petco and retail strip
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.560]  mall type stuff. And the Balikinwood side is all high rise offices and medical buildings and stuff.
[20:34.080 --> 20:40.560]  But we were driving out there for something and on the radio came on Adam Sandler's song,
[20:40.560 --> 20:47.760]  Piece of Shit Car, speaking of profanity. But it was on the radio. And so it's a very funny song.
[20:47.760 --> 20:54.320]  It is very, very funny. But because it was on the radio every time he swears, it was beeped.
[20:54.320 --> 21:18.160]  But we thought it was so funny beeped that we thought that maybe even on his CD or wherever
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.400]  he published it, that it was meant to be beeped because it was so funny.
[21:22.400 --> 21:25.360]  I think part of the rhythm, part of the rhythm of the song.
[21:25.360 --> 21:30.640]  It's not. It actually was a censored version, whatever you call it, FM friendly version.
[21:30.640 --> 21:36.320]  But there must be 100 beeps in the song. And because it rhymes, you know what every curse
[21:36.320 --> 21:45.920]  word is. Yeah. But that's what your how to X edited document. It's hilarious because you just
[21:45.920 --> 21:54.080]  imagine curse words in there. You can't help to. The best part is at the very end, right, which is
[21:54.080 --> 22:00.400]  like it has a standard share button, right, which was the bird. And then the word next to it was
[22:00.400 --> 22:16.960]  tweet. Right. But now is X, X. Retweets became Re-X's, Rex's. It was one of those things that
[22:16.960 --> 22:22.320]  I just I looked at it and it was like, oh, man, it's going to take them forever to update the
[22:22.320 --> 22:28.880]  site to not say Twitter or tweet. I mean, it's just all over the place. So I took this one page.
[22:28.880 --> 22:34.320]  I was thinking, yeah, I'm just going to poke around at it. And it took me like 45 minutes
[22:34.320 --> 22:38.880]  to do this because it's just it's like I thought it was done. And they say, oh, no, there's the
[22:38.880 --> 22:45.440]  footer. Oh, no, there's the header. Oh, there's a little icon next to the help center. It took a
[22:45.440 --> 22:50.640]  long time. And that's just one page and probably tens of thousands. And they're all localized.
[22:50.640 --> 22:59.920]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. So so are you going to localize X into Hungarian or whatever? It's like, yeah,
[22:59.920 --> 23:06.960]  but that that help document, though, is like the epicenter of the three K, at least the three main
[23:06.960 --> 23:15.440]  cases, Twitter as a service, tweet as a noun, the the name for the post and tweet as a verb,
[23:15.440 --> 23:21.040]  the act of creating a tweet. And so all all of those are repeated. That's what the whole
[23:21.040 --> 23:29.200]  documents about using the service Twitter to tweet tweets. And instead, it's just using X to X X's.
[23:31.200 --> 23:39.120]  Yeah. The stupidity of it is you start thinking about how many things in common language
[23:39.120 --> 23:44.880]  are both nouns and verbs in like a product, right? It's like Google. Yep. There's
[23:45.840 --> 23:54.400]  Xerox. Yep. There's Instagram to some point, Instagram, you know, sort of, but there are
[23:54.400 --> 24:02.720]  many. It's nowhere near as elegant as tweet. Tweet and tweet was like somebody. It's escaping
[24:02.720 --> 24:07.760]  me at the moment. Xerox is obviously almost canonical. Google is the modern version of
[24:07.760 --> 24:13.680]  Xerox. Super, super powerful. I'm trying somebody had in this week, somebody thought of another
[24:13.680 --> 24:18.960]  there was another good example. But but those are that's enough. And Twitter had that. And you kind
[24:18.960 --> 24:24.160]  of have to look into it. And they really looked into it. And again, it's why one of the reasons
[24:24.160 --> 24:31.680]  I thought I gave it to them. They got lucky, right? Again, I call it out, you call it out,
[24:31.680 --> 24:36.640]  you should it's not it's not bragging. It's not it's not taking credit for something that
[24:36.640 --> 24:44.160]  are exaggerating the credit. It really is true that pre Twitter rific. Twitter didn't not only
[24:44.160 --> 24:50.640]  didn't have tweet as as a verb or noun. They didn't have a bird logo. They their logo was a
[24:50.640 --> 24:57.600]  like a sort of bubble font, lowercase t. Yeah, it was a logo mark. Yeah. Just a weird little,
[24:57.600 --> 25:03.840]  well in the tea. It wasn't bad. It was fine. It was fine. I mean, but the bird was obviously
[25:03.840 --> 25:10.800]  better, right? The bird was obviously better. And the bird led to tweet. tweet led to. Yeah,
[25:10.800 --> 25:17.440]  yeah. But so change of things. So we've all thought of dozens of ways that this is just
[25:19.440 --> 25:24.080]  not well thought through. And obviously, the fact that it took them a whole week to get updated
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.240]  versions of the app out the fact that though even the website, they couldn't change right away.
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.240]  But here's a here's a question I saw. So this didn't pop into my head until I saw somebody
[25:32.240 --> 25:36.480]  else bring it up. But somebody else. And I think a couple of people had the observation. So I don't
[25:36.480 --> 25:43.040]  feel like I'm stealing from one person. But how many a websites out there at the bottom of their
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.120]  homepage? It's like a Twitter logo, an Instagram logo, a Facebook logo, right? If you have an F,
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.840]  a camera and a bird, you know what that means. It means, oh, this is our Twitter account,
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.760]  our Instagram account and our Facebook account. But some combination of those three. And just
[25:59.760 --> 26:05.360]  and just think about like real world retail places, restaurants and stuff like that. I
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.800]  stick around the window or on the menu, right? Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.400]  when they get around to updating that or dealing with it, like, I guess we should do something
[26:18.400 --> 26:24.480]  about this once once this name change settles in and Twitter feels like it's not the name of the
[26:24.480 --> 26:31.040]  thing anymore. What percentage of them are just going to delete it rather than update it with the?
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.920]  I think it's a very high percentage. Yeah. I mean, we replaced ours. In fact,
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.560]  it took about a week to go through all the sites and find all the instances of Twitter,
[26:41.200 --> 26:47.520]  the mentions of it in CSS, just all the CSS rules that said that this is the class Twitter,
[26:47.520 --> 26:54.880]  then show the little icon, that kind of thing. And, yeah, it was a fairly lengthy process.
[26:54.880 --> 27:01.680]  And if I'm a corporation who used to rely on Twitter as a way to connect with customers,
[27:02.960 --> 27:07.360]  I'm just going to go, there's nothing there anymore, right? Because it goes back to this
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.760]  problem where you go, OK, you go look at it. Say you want to look at Chalk & Berry or Icon Factory.
[27:13.760 --> 27:21.440]  The first thing you see is X logo, blow it, sign into Twitter.
[27:22.560 --> 27:27.200]  And if I don't have a Twitter account, I can't just be curious and say, who is this company?
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.640]  Who is this person? I think if I'm running things at a company like that,
[27:32.640 --> 27:42.080]  it's got no footprint for this kind of casual information. I'm just going to remove it.
[27:42.080 --> 27:48.160]  Yeah. And think about it from a branding perspective, too. If you're in charge of
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.920]  the brand, whether it's just a restaurant or a major company, but if you're in charge of that
[27:54.720 --> 28:07.920]  and you're concerned about the sort of rightward lurch and sort of the politics of Twitter under
[28:07.920 --> 28:13.360]  Musk and the direction it's gone and the people, the sort of people who are happy about his takeover
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.840]  versus who aren't leaving your company's Twitter logo on your homepage or your window or wherever
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.640]  else you had it. I think you could get away with that heretofore because people just know it's been
[28:26.640 --> 28:35.680]  there. It's inertia, right? It's branding inertia, scraping the Twitter bird off your window and
[28:35.680 --> 28:44.000]  replacing it with the new X mark is a way to me is a way of saying we're down with the new X.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.520]  But it's maybe not the final X mark. Oh, no. Yeah. They said that, right? You got to go through all
[28:49.520 --> 28:54.400]  this effort and make a new X graphic or whatever. And then they, oh, well, we're going to change it
[28:54.400 --> 29:00.880]  again. Yeah. Who knows? So yeah, go do that work again. That's why I say it doesn't feel like
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.960]  something that people are going to go rush to do. I wonder though, I kind of suspect that he likes
[29:06.960 --> 29:15.120]  it enough that if they do change it, it'll be like a sort of get pay somebody to redraw it and
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.640]  it'll sort of look the same as it does right now. The sort of the one side is a hollow thicker
[29:20.640 --> 29:27.040]  leg to X and the other's just a diagonal because I mean, say what you want about him. He doesn't
[29:27.040 --> 29:34.080]  seem to alter or play with the brands of his other companies on a whim, right? Like the Tesla
[29:34.080 --> 29:39.520]  badge on the cars hasn't changed. I don't think ever the X and space X. Yeah. I mean,
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.920]  it already has an X, so I don't think he's going to, but who knows? I don't know. I certainly don't
[29:43.920 --> 29:47.920]  want to bet any money that he's not going to change the name to why I don't. That's the
[29:47.920 --> 29:52.240]  thing that feels like there's no predictability to the company now. That's just, and that's not a
[29:52.240 --> 29:57.520]  sign for something of something you want to invest your time and energy in. Right. But I really do
[29:57.520 --> 30:04.560]  think that they're going to lose out on, on the co-branding. I mean, again, it's so easy to take
[30:04.560 --> 30:13.840]  for granted because a brand like Twitter and the presence of Twitter in society is a slow boil,
[30:13.840 --> 30:19.920]  right? But there really was when it got started, when you were first writing the first version of
[30:19.920 --> 30:25.680]  Twitter riffic for the iPhone in the, what was it? The summer, the first summer, right? 2007.
[30:25.680 --> 30:31.280]  Yeah. Cause did you have a prototype at C4 or no, not yet? No, no. That's where,
[30:31.280 --> 30:38.880]  that's where I met Lucas Newman who tuned me into all the jailbreaking stuff. And that's when I went
[30:38.880 --> 30:42.960]  and started working on a jailbreak version of Twitter. Right. Right. And then they announced
[30:42.960 --> 30:50.240]  the SDK and then on hold the SDK dropped and then I had a headstart. You had a Mac version already
[30:50.240 --> 30:55.920]  though. That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the brilliant thing that Apple did was
[30:55.920 --> 31:02.880]  make the iPhone SDK look like the Mac SDK and it was easy to adopt. Right. Right. Right. You had
[31:02.880 --> 31:09.040]  like entire classes of like talking to the server that you could just reuse. Yeah. But what was I,
[31:09.040 --> 31:16.160]  where was I going with that? I forget. It's so confusing. Something about brand equity.
[31:16.160 --> 31:21.920]  Oh, it, it, the way that it, it, it, at that time, at that point in time, 2007,
[31:22.720 --> 31:28.080]  Twitter was just one website among many. Right. And, and we were into it and it's like,
[31:28.080 --> 31:35.440]  people like us saw the appeal of it, but there was not a something that when you went on CNN,
[31:35.440 --> 31:40.400]  that they would say Craig Hockenberry at chalk and Barry, nobody would know what the hell that
[31:40.400 --> 31:43.280]  means. There'd be like, what the hell is that thing with the ad symbol after his name? It's
[31:43.280 --> 31:47.360]  not, that's not an email address. What is that? Nobody, I don't even think we had that yet. Right.
[31:47.360 --> 31:51.440]  We didn't even have the, yeah, the whole app username thing hadn't even been invented yet.
[31:51.440 --> 31:57.600]  Right. No, no, no. Right. That was Robert Anderson. I believe it was Robert Anderson.
[31:58.480 --> 32:04.080]  I think he invented that. And of course, Chris Messina invented hashtags a couple of years later,
[32:04.080 --> 32:10.160]  but none of that had been invented yet, but somehow slowly but surely Twitter went from
[32:10.160 --> 32:18.240]  one, Hey, website that people like John Gruber and Craig Hockenberry are into to a major cultural
[32:18.240 --> 32:26.480]  force and a mass market thing. But like of all the websites that had as much traffic as Twitter did
[32:26.480 --> 32:31.600]  circa 2007. And you know, Facebook was very small back then. I think MySpace was, was still
[32:31.600 --> 32:37.520]  the king of the social media at the time to get to the point where it's just ubiquitous. I,
[32:37.520 --> 32:42.000]  somebody told me I pronounced that word wrong. So whichever way you pronounce it to go to ubiquitous.
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.520]  Yeah. Yeah. Ubiquitous. So you go to a store and there's a little bird icon and an F logo for
[32:47.520 --> 32:55.280]  Facebook and an Instagram logo. There are very, very few platforms that are in that stature
[32:55.280 --> 33:02.800]  where just random businesses across the spectrum promote their presence on your platform. There's
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.600]  only a handful, right? Snapchat's there to some degree, depending on the demographic,
[33:07.600 --> 33:12.400]  how young it goes. I'm sure TikTok... Well, one of the things that they did,
[33:12.400 --> 33:17.360]  that they stated when they did the, redid the Instagram icon was remember the hubbub?
[33:17.360 --> 33:22.560]  Yes. Yes. Oh, they changed it with the Polaroid camera. It's like one of their design goals,
[33:22.560 --> 33:26.080]  is to make something that looked good as a sticker on the window.
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.600]  Yep. And that's, it's as much as I miss the old...
[33:29.600 --> 33:31.040]  Smart thing to do. Yeah.
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.120]  As much as I miss the old skeuomorphic Instagram icon, it's, and putting this...
[33:37.120 --> 33:38.080]  It made sense.
[33:38.080 --> 33:43.600]  Yeah. It totally makes sense. And it's super, super popular. And they realized they reached
[33:43.600 --> 33:49.760]  that. Twitter was there. And so many people have said it, Ben Thompson says it all the time,
[33:49.760 --> 33:54.880]  that culturally, Twitter has always punched above its weight. They never figured out a
[33:54.880 --> 34:01.840]  way to make a lot of money, but they had certainly were extremely influential in terms of driving
[34:01.840 --> 34:10.480]  the news narrative, a place for breaking news, a place where both the politicians and actual
[34:10.480 --> 34:16.640]  officials participate. We had a president of the United States who effectively ran his whole
[34:16.640 --> 34:24.560]  campaign on Twitter. It couldn't be more influential, even if it never became the
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.600]  financial juggernaut that Facebook did. But in terms of its cultural impact was tremendous.
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.720]  But there's no way. It really is flushed down the toilet with this name change. It really is.
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.720]  Yeah. I think one of the things that they missed opportunity was, goes back to this identity,
[34:42.720 --> 34:51.280]  right? Gruber, Chalkenberry, icon factory, Bank of America, right? Whoever had their identity
[34:51.280 --> 35:01.680]  on Twitter. And I could envision... I'd pay 100 bucks a year to be Chalkenberry, right?
[35:02.640 --> 35:10.400]  That's my place. If you want to know about me, I'm happy to pay that. And in the scheme of things,
[35:10.400 --> 35:18.640]  that's to plant your flag on the internet. That's a valuable thing. And they could have done
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.680]  something with that. And sure, hot boy 57, whatever it is, he's not going to pay 100 bucks
[35:23.680 --> 35:29.600]  a year for that. But for other individuals and companies, it could have been something for them.
[35:29.600 --> 35:37.600]  If they hadn't made it so polarized, the idea of creating a paid tier of Twitter is a great idea.
[35:37.600 --> 35:48.160]  It really is. I mean, it's not a path to Facebook size, financial juggernaut hood, but almost
[35:48.160 --> 35:58.960]  nothing is, right? I always compare the desire of just vague Wall Street investors who want
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.440]  Twitter to be more like Facebook because Facebook is worth so much more money to the people who
[36:03.440 --> 36:08.800]  wanted Apple to clone the Macintosh back in the 90s because Microsoft was so humongous. Hey,
[36:08.800 --> 36:14.960]  Microsoft just licenses their operating system. So that's obviously the way to do it. Whereas
[36:14.960 --> 36:22.400]  there was only ever going to be one Microsoft in that 80s to 90s rah rah era of the PC. There was.
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.960]  And Apple had that cultural angle that Twitter has.
[36:26.960 --> 36:33.600]  Right, exactly. Twitter is Facebook. Yeah. And I don't, I actually pre Musk, I think
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.720]  you could draw, draw the compare. I don't think it's a goofy analogy to say Twitter was to
[36:40.720 --> 36:50.480]  Facebook. What Apple was to Microsoft. And it just shows how important the infusion of totally fresh
[36:50.480 --> 36:57.760]  leadership that Apple got when they acquired next and jobs came in with his executives and took over
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.240]  compared to Twitter, where a different team came in and took over.
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.960]  Jobs came back and one of the first things he did was he learned what everybody was doing.
[37:06.960 --> 37:12.880]  Yeah, exactly. It's like, he was not afraid to ask questions and he asked a lot of questions.
[37:12.880 --> 37:18.080]  He figured out what the hell was going on. And then he's like, okay, we don't need the Newton
[37:18.080 --> 37:24.960]  anymore or whatever it was. I was just like, okay, done. Well, the single best thing and,
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.240]  and the story has been told many times by jobs himself, by Johnny Ive, by other people,
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.120]  by biographers, but jobs came in and thought, well, look at the lineup of their Macintoshes.
[37:37.120 --> 37:42.720]  These are all boring and horrible beige boxes. There were so many of them.
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.920]  There were so many of them, but just he thought I'm obviously going to have to fire the whole
[37:47.920 --> 37:52.640]  industrial design team because they're obviously inept, but he didn't. What he did is he went and
[37:52.640 --> 38:02.480]  met with them, found a guy named Johnny Ive and found the things that they'd been noodling on
[38:02.480 --> 38:08.800]  that weren't getting authorized to ship and realized that it was a gold mine of talent,
[38:08.800 --> 38:16.000]  not just one guy, Johnny Ive, but the whole team that, wow, this is actually the industrial design
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.120]  team that this company needs. They just need to be set free. Very different approach to how to do it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.920]  And I'm sure that Twitter lost a lot of great people. I know a few of them, right?
[38:29.920 --> 38:36.240]  The really talented developers who were just like, either let go or became totally disillusioned
[38:36.240 --> 38:42.960]  with the whole clusterfuck. If I'd been there and not been laid off, I would have been out the door
[38:42.960 --> 38:49.200]  at first opportunity, just not even thinking twice. Well, I don't know what I would, I guess
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.880]  it depends what I wanted to do. Esther Crawford wrote an essay I linked to on Daring Fireball
[38:54.880 --> 39:01.840]  this week. She was the, I forget her title, but like it's sort of a... She was an aqua hire.
[39:01.840 --> 39:10.240]  Yeah, but she was a design manager and her team effectively was proposing designs. And then I know
[39:10.240 --> 39:14.880]  some of the people who were tasked with implementing them. And she's the one who
[39:14.880 --> 39:19.920]  infamously tweeted, sort of was going with the flow and that's sort of trying to have a team
[39:19.920 --> 39:26.720]  spirit and happily showing how she was sleeping in a sleeping bag to pull an all-nighter to meet.
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.840]  All-nighters happen, in my opinion. I mean, the older you get...
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.520]  It's just, right. It's a good thing in some cases, right? It's like a lot of energy is...
[39:37.520 --> 39:44.240]  Right. And sometimes you have deadlines that just can't be moved. I'm sure, for example,
[39:44.240 --> 39:49.760]  even at Apple, I'm sure that there are some things in the run-up to WWDC that require long hours,
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.200]  because, hey, we've already announced the dates. It has to happen, right?
[39:53.840 --> 39:58.240]  No sleep till dub-dub. That's the saying, right? And it's true.
[39:58.240 --> 40:04.400]  Right. There's going to be an iPhone event in September. There always is, unless there's a
[40:04.400 --> 40:10.080]  pandemic and they have to move it to October. But there are going to be some aspects of iOS
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.480]  that have to be... Iowa 17 that have to be locked down in August to ship in September.
[40:17.040 --> 40:22.160]  And the deadlines have to be met. But the deadlines that Musk was imposing were entirely
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.680]  just imposed by him out of... Whimsical.
[40:26.480 --> 40:31.280]  Impatience. Yeah. Whimsical impatience. But anyway, she tweeted, hey, sometimes you have
[40:31.280 --> 40:35.520]  to pull an all-nighter and I made fun of it on Daring Farm. But she wrote a very nice essay
[40:35.520 --> 40:41.920]  about her time there and why she stayed. And I can see the perspective. She was part of the
[40:41.920 --> 40:48.080]  people at Twitter who... And she came as an aqua hire from a startup, I forget what it was, but
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.120]  at a smaller team where they obviously built something good enough for Twitter to buy.
[40:54.080 --> 41:00.240]  And when you're used to a small team that makes something new at a fast speed and you end up in
[41:00.240 --> 41:10.960]  this organization that pre-Musk had like sclerosis. And the leadership, the company was ossified.
[41:10.960 --> 41:17.920]  They've shipped very few features over the past 10 years, honestly. And they sort of had developed
[41:17.920 --> 41:25.920]  a culture of stasis. Yeah. They had hundreds of people working on the iOS app. I mean,
[41:25.920 --> 41:35.840]  for Twitter, we had three of them. Somebody told me they had a whole team that worked on the search
[41:35.840 --> 41:42.160]  box for the website, not search feature where they were writing the code that actually searches,
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.000]  just the box where you type the search queries, all team.
[41:46.640 --> 41:51.840]  It seems like you start to second guess yourself and it's just like sometimes you just got to go
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.040]  with your gut. And that's where AB testing comes from. It's like there are too many people,
[41:57.040 --> 42:02.880]  too many opinions, just pick one and go. So when Musk came in and said, hey, we're
[42:02.880 --> 42:07.840]  going to shake things up. I'm going to let go of a lot of people and we're going to move fast
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.480]  and make some changes. I can see if wanting to stay and see if you could be part of shipping
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.120]  some cool stuff and see how it goes. But the reason why you were optimistic about it?
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.600]  Well, yeah, definitely. I mean, because I knew that he was going to try that. And like I wrote
[42:23.600 --> 42:28.080]  this week, I'm not trying to cover. I was clearly wrong to be optimistic about Twitter. I mean,
[42:28.080 --> 42:34.320]  and I feel like I'm owning it. I'm not. Yeah, no, no, you are. I was pessimistic about it.
[42:34.320 --> 42:43.120]  Right. And one of us got lucky. Yeah. But I do think I'm I do think that not that I was right,
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.480]  but that I was on the right trail, that it was his his buying Twitter was good for Twitter like
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.760]  things. It's the best thing that ever happened to Mastodon. I mean, for sure. Yeah. And enormous
[42:53.760 --> 42:58.400]  reds. I don't think what exhibit exists without it. I'm almost certain it would not. And I like
[42:58.400 --> 43:04.080]  threads. I like threads quite a bit. I like Mastodon better. And it's still going to Mastodon
[43:04.080 --> 43:10.880]  is still my first choice for brief dips into social media. But I can I do like threads and
[43:10.880 --> 43:16.960]  I appreciate and I understand that the reasons that I like Mastodon better than I like it better
[43:16.960 --> 43:23.840]  than threads is exactly why threads is better for more people. It's celebrity common ground
[43:23.840 --> 43:30.560]  kind of stuff. Yeah. And it's Mastodon tends to skew techie. Yeah. Right. Just it just does.
[43:30.560 --> 43:36.560]  Yeah. Well, and like one thing, a big difference I noticed and I'm sure you would notice and think
[43:36.560 --> 43:43.840]  of is by choice. Like when I open up ivory, I get taken back exactly to where I was the last time I
[43:43.840 --> 43:49.520]  used it, even if it was on another device. Right. So I can like be browsing ivory on my iPad and
[43:49.520 --> 43:54.400]  then I go on my phone and oh, there I am in the same place in the same looking at the same thing
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.120]  at the same point in my timeline. Every time you go back to threads, it sort of starts you at the
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.680]  top again. I mean, if you leave for like a minute and come back, it'll be right where you were. But
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.160]  if you that's the problem with algorithmic timeline, right? It's like it's all generated
[44:08.160 --> 44:14.400]  on the fly and it's hard to reestablish on the fly when you go back. Well, they added the following
[44:14.400 --> 44:20.960]  timeline this week. But every time you go back after it pages out of memory, it defaults you back
[44:20.960 --> 44:27.440]  to the to the algorithmic one. But that is it's the right thing for 100 million people. It's the
[44:27.440 --> 44:35.280]  wrong thing for the 1 million people like me, the 1% who sort of prefer having deliberate control of
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.960]  my place in the timeline as opposed to just sort of letting it all wash over you. But they know
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.160]  what they're doing. I mean, Instagram is still super duper popular. It's not a limitation of
[44:46.160 --> 44:52.960]  threads. It's a deliberate choice that's optimized for the way much more casual users of a Twitter
[44:52.960 --> 44:59.200]  like service want to see stuff. They just want to see something interesting. Whereas I want to see
[44:59.200 --> 45:04.400]  something specific. These people who I chose to follow and where I was when I last was there.
[45:04.400 --> 45:11.680]  I find it a good way to back channel type of conversations, right? If somebody at Apple who
[45:11.680 --> 45:17.840]  knows something about this throw a massive on and you just kind of ping them there. And if I don't
[45:17.840 --> 45:24.960]  get a reply, fine, I don't get a reply. If I do, it's usually helpful. And I'll take that information
[45:24.960 --> 45:32.480]  and forward it on to my followers kind of thing. So, I'm really happy that there are alternatives
[45:32.480 --> 45:41.600]  now, right? The fact that there's a marketplace of conversational tools and threads, Blue Sky,
[45:41.600 --> 45:49.040]  Mastodon, there will be others. I think it's good. It's sub stack has their own thing. And it's
[45:49.040 --> 45:54.240]  obviously niche. But if you follow a couple of sub stack authors, they have these sub stack and
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.600]  you're into writing. Yeah. That's the place for you. And it's a way that
[45:59.600 --> 46:06.480]  somebody who does what I do, but does it as a sub stack newsletter can communicate with their
[46:06.480 --> 46:12.960]  readers in a Twitter like fashion in a tab in the sub stack app. It's nice. It's a great format.
[46:12.960 --> 46:20.720]  It doesn't, the fact that Twitter by way of its overwhelming network effect advantage,
[46:20.720 --> 46:26.880]  sort of took all the oxygen out of the idea. To me, the very best thing to come out of this
[46:26.880 --> 46:33.840]  is the fact that it's not just federated in one federation, like Mastodon and Activity Pub and
[46:33.840 --> 46:40.880]  whatever else you want to call that circle of federation. But it's even more loosely federated,
[46:40.880 --> 46:46.160]  like you said, with Blue Sky, which is a different protocol with threads, with these Twitter like
[46:46.160 --> 46:53.920]  things. It's just an idea, right? It's just, hey, and that core idea that Jack Dorsey had back in
[46:53.920 --> 47:00.320]  2006 or 2005, whenever he had the little sketch on his notepad, of just a place where you could
[47:00.320 --> 47:06.800]  just post short text updates and people who choose to follow your updates can follow them
[47:07.360 --> 47:15.680]  is brilliant. Yes. The name was S-T-A-T period U-S status. Yeah. Right. And that's all it is.
[47:15.680 --> 47:20.800]  It's like, what's going on with me? And that's still how I use these services. It's like,
[47:20.800 --> 47:27.120]  what's going on? In fact, that used to be the prompt at Twitter. It was, what are you doing?
[47:27.120 --> 47:34.400]  Yeah, what are you doing? What's going on? Now it's what's happening. With an interrobang.
[47:34.400 --> 47:42.000]  Yeah. Like screaming at you, what's happening? I imagine that guy across the street from Twitter
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.760]  headquarters said the exact same thing. He's wondering, what the hell is happening? What's
[47:45.760 --> 47:54.000]  happening? All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends.
[47:54.000 --> 47:58.160]  Seriously, listen to this sponsorship read, because it could seriously save your bacon.
[47:58.160 --> 48:04.880]  It's our good friends at Backblaze. Backblaze is online backup for your Mac or PC. I've been using
[48:04.880 --> 48:09.600]  it for a long time. I don't know, maybe close to 10 years. Again, the years are flying by,
[48:09.600 --> 48:15.920]  but it's a very long time. I am a very happy paying customer. Seven bucks a month, no gimmicks
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.480]  or add ons or gotchas, nothing complicated, no upsells like that, that you don't need.
[48:21.040 --> 48:26.880]  And that gets you unlimited backup for Mac or PC, all of your movies, your music, your photos,
[48:27.600 --> 48:35.360]  projects, everything all gets backed up to the cloud. It protects your data. They have over
[48:35.360 --> 48:42.400]  two exabytes of data storage under management and counting. That is two exabytes is two billion
[48:42.400 --> 48:51.120]  gigabytes. So it's a lot of gigabytes. They have restored over 55 billion files for customers
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.720]  since they've been in business. That's what you can access it over the web from anywhere in the
[48:56.720 --> 49:01.120]  world. You just log in with your credentials at backblaze.com and you can just get your files
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.240]  from any machine anywhere. They have apps for your phone, for your iPad, where you can access
[49:06.240 --> 49:12.240]  your files that have been backed up to backblaze anywhere. If an emergency strikes some kind of
[49:12.240 --> 49:19.680]  catastrophe and you need all of your stuff like terabytes of data ASAP, you can get restored by
[49:19.680 --> 49:26.560]  mail where they will put your stuff on a USB drive, FedEx it to you, and you can just restore
[49:26.560 --> 49:30.080]  from the drive they send you, send the drive back to them, and they give you the money for the
[49:30.080 --> 49:35.360]  drive back. So it's no cost to you. It's like shipping or something like that. And you can
[49:35.360 --> 49:41.520]  literally get it overnight. It is absolutely fantastic. If you are worried about accidentally
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.640]  deleting files and then like a week from now, a month from now, realizing, oh, that file I
[49:48.640 --> 49:54.960]  deleted a month ago, I need that, you can pay for an extra two bucks a month and you can increase
[49:54.960 --> 50:01.920]  your retention history by a full year. So seven bucks a month per PC, that's just the regular
[50:01.920 --> 50:09.120]  backblaze service. For just two bucks a month, you can add a year of retention history. So some file
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.560]  you deleted six months ago and now you need it, you can get it for just two bucks a month. Great,
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.280]  great add-on. As far as I know, that's the only add-on they even have. That's it. That's how
[50:19.280 --> 50:26.080]  simple it is. Recommended by me, recommended by the New York Times, Macworld, PCWorld, Wired,
[50:26.080 --> 50:29.680]  you name it. I don't know anybody who doesn't recommend backblaze who's tried it. It is so
[50:29.680 --> 50:37.360]  great. 15-day no credit card required free trial. Go to backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.840]  15 days is plenty of time to get your initial upload up there. See how it works. The Mac
[50:41.840 --> 50:49.040]  software, super, super simple, very easy, and you never notice it. It's not like all of a sudden when
[50:49.040 --> 50:56.160]  it starts backing up, it freezes your machine or you notice it. It just silently in the background,
[50:56.160 --> 51:03.440]  everything uploaded to the cloud. It couldn't be easier. Backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.680]  15-day no credit card required free trial. My thanks to them.
[51:08.960 --> 51:18.080]  I've had a tab on one of my Safari spaces for backblaze for probably the last nine months
[51:18.080 --> 51:24.640]  because I need to go set this up. I mean, we do a backup of our server every night onto a Mac
[51:24.640 --> 51:31.440]  Mini that sits right behind me, right by my desk. And I worry about that Mac Mini, right? If the
[51:31.440 --> 51:40.720]  house burns down, we've lost a lot of important information. I'm going to go to that talk show.
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.800]  I would not recommend only using online backup, but I would definitely recommend always using
[51:46.800 --> 51:51.520]  some kind of online backup. Oh, you got to have multiple backups, right? It's like a time machine
[51:51.520 --> 51:59.680]  locally then to another machine then to the cloud. Yeah. Before we started recording the show,
[51:59.680 --> 52:04.640]  I published a little article on daring fireball about foldable phones. Some I call them. I didn't
[52:04.640 --> 52:08.880]  call them a jackass by name. I gave it to the whole publication, but the gist of the article
[52:08.880 --> 52:13.360]  was if Apple doesn't soon ship a foldable phone, there'll be no reason to buy an iPhone.
[52:13.360 --> 52:20.880]  Yeah, right. No camera improvements, nothing. Yeah, no, no.
[52:20.880 --> 52:25.760]  Well, I almost feel like I want to give them credit because for all the fear that we have
[52:25.760 --> 52:31.440]  that AI is going to take over clickbait, it's like, no, no, only humans are still really good
[52:31.440 --> 52:36.320]  at it. Yeah. Humans are still good at it. That's really good clickbait.
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.040]  Well, who was it that made the observation that the percentage of people who want a foldable
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.840]  phone and then the percentage of people who can afford that foldable phone, then the percentage
[52:45.840 --> 52:51.520]  of people who can afford that foldable phone is going to break. It's too early.
[52:52.720 --> 52:59.360]  The tech's not there. The dream is there. I mean, as the technology currently stands,
[52:59.360 --> 53:04.800]  do you have any desire for this whatsoever? Let's put aside the fact that by all accounts,
[53:04.800 --> 53:09.360]  Samsung's the best at this. Google just shipped their first foldable pixels.
[53:09.360 --> 53:14.400]  And most of the reviews I see the consensus is that they're not as good as the Samsung ones.
[53:14.400 --> 53:20.400]  And part of the problem is they always have like a gap, like at least the flip phones do,
[53:20.400 --> 53:24.800]  or I think they all do because if they fold flat, the glass cracks.
[53:24.800 --> 53:32.080]  So they kind of need to form a wedge shape when closed as opposed to a completely flat sandwich.
[53:32.640 --> 53:37.680]  Let's put that aside. All of them, including Samsung's, the best they can do
[53:37.680 --> 53:42.720]  for some reason that I don't quite understand is water resistance, but no dust resistance.
[53:42.720 --> 53:47.440]  There's something to do with the hinge where they can waterproof the gaps, but they can't
[53:48.240 --> 53:52.640]  dust proof the gaps for the hinge. And so they always say specifically,
[53:52.640 --> 53:58.000]  don't don't take these things to the beach, the beach. And that's a problem for you, right?
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.440]  I mean, as soon as we finish this podcast. Not taking it to the beach is kind of a
[54:05.440 --> 54:12.320]  bummer. I mean, because they're literally like IPX8 rated. And the way those ratings work,
[54:12.320 --> 54:18.640]  I forget what the numbers mean, but it's IP means like this is it's the international standards body
[54:18.640 --> 54:24.640]  for dust and water resistance. The first number is for particles like dust and the second one is for
[54:24.640 --> 54:31.680]  water. So the eight is like a nice rating. I think, you know, like iPhones are IP68 and that's
[54:31.680 --> 54:38.480]  six for the dust and eight for water resistance. And Samsung's Galaxy flagships are all IP68 too.
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.160]  That's sort of the modern standard for dust and water resistance. But these foldables are IPX8
[54:44.160 --> 54:52.160]  and the X just means no dust resistance. Well, it's not so much the dust resistance that would
[54:52.160 --> 54:56.080]  bug me. It's just that these things are little fat boys, right? Like they're not going to fit
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.600]  in your pocket. Well, if you're a woman and what's going on in the purse, it might be better for that
[55:01.600 --> 55:09.360]  case. But for me personally, it's just, I don't want a thicker phone. No, and I don't want to
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.760]  have to open it. And people are saying like these new Samsung just had their event this week with
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.120]  the flip and fold five fold. Is there one that's like a book and the flip is the flip phone thing.
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.480]  And people are saying that they've spent a lot of time on the hinges and the hinges are different,
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.920]  but now they're harder to open. I don't know. It doesn't seem appealing. I like to take my phone
[55:29.920 --> 55:34.960]  out, do something and put it back. Opening it doesn't seem appealing. Having the big screen
[55:34.960 --> 55:42.880]  of the book size ones and getting like an iPad or an iPad mini-ish total real estate,
[55:42.880 --> 55:49.360]  I see the appeal of it. But only if in the folded state, it's like as thick as an iPhone is today,
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.360]  right? Like if there was like a phone as maybe a little thicker than an iPhone today,
[55:55.360 --> 56:03.040]  but that opened up to be double the size, talk to me then. But as it stands now,
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.680]  the big ones, it really is as thick as having two phones in your pocket.
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.120]  Yeah. And you think about it. Anybody with an Apple watch already has two screens,
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.400]  right? You'd already have multiple screens and you don't have to unfold them. And sometimes I
[56:18.400 --> 56:25.680]  get my information without pulling the phone out of my pocket. In fact, if I go to the beach,
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.360]  which I do pretty much every day, I just take my Apple watch because I can have my grocery
[56:31.360 --> 56:36.240]  list on it and I can have some music on it and tell them what time it is.
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.120]  Or podcasts, Craig. Podcasts. I want you to have your podcasts on your watch.
[56:41.120 --> 56:49.040]  All right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. My problem with podcasts is I love listening to them,
[56:49.680 --> 56:52.000]  but I can't listen to them and work at the same time.
[56:52.000 --> 56:52.800]  No, me neither.
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.320]  And it's like when I'm doing dishes and stuff, that's usually when my wife and I are chatting
[56:58.320 --> 57:01.520]  about something and just sitting in front of the TV, I'm not going to be listening to podcasts.
[57:01.520 --> 57:02.020]  Yeah.
[57:02.560 --> 57:04.640]  I just, it doesn't, yeah.
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.680]  Our friend Brent Simmons enjoys listening to podcasts while he works. And I don't know how
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.000]  he does it because I don't know. But for me, it's either it's one way or the other where if I try
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  listening to a podcast while I work, either I get, it's like, wow, this is really good. And I
[57:20.000 --> 57:26.640]  realize I haven't done anything for 40 minutes or I I'm doing something and I realize I've just
[57:26.640 --> 57:29.360]  missed 40 minutes of this podcast. I'm going to have to listen to it again.
[57:29.360 --> 57:34.960]  Or yeah, it just ended. It's like falling asleep on a TV show. What happened?
[57:34.960 --> 57:40.320]  Yeah. I really, if I were going to listen to a podcast, I would need it to be like,
[57:40.880 --> 57:47.840]  like in a foreign language that I don't speak or like the Sims language, like white noise.
[57:47.840 --> 57:52.960]  That's just fake human voices, but it can't be real talking because I would be distracted.
[57:53.520 --> 57:58.640]  That's why I love music for me working with music. It's there, but you can also tune it out.
[57:58.640 --> 58:03.280]  Yeah. Do you find the, do you prefer listening to music that doesn't have lyrics
[58:03.280 --> 58:05.520]  like instrumental music or it doesn't matter to you?
[58:05.520 --> 58:07.760]  No, I love lyrical music.
[58:07.760 --> 58:09.440]  Yeah. But do you listen?
[58:09.440 --> 58:12.400]  Yeah, but I don't really listen to the lyrics while I'm working. Right.
[58:13.600 --> 58:14.960]  They're a part of the song.
[58:16.160 --> 58:19.840]  My wife and I, maybe, and I have talked about Amy is a big lyrics, listen,
[58:19.840 --> 58:24.240]  listener and the music she loves. She knows all the music and she appreciates it like
[58:24.240 --> 58:26.960]  somebody appreciates poetry. And so many of her.
[58:26.960 --> 58:27.920]  She's a Tom Petty.
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.040]  Yeah. Yes, exactly. Like it's, it's not just that she likes the way Tom Petty's music sounds.
[58:33.040 --> 58:36.720]  She really, really deeply appreciates and always has since.
[58:36.720 --> 58:40.000]  He was underrated as, as from that aspect. But a lot of people,
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.480]  a lot of people heard the tune behind it.
[58:44.480 --> 58:47.280]  Dylan ask in terms of his poetry and it's no,
[58:47.280 --> 58:52.000]  no surprise that Dylan was obviously a big fit petty fan with the Wilburys and.
[58:52.000 --> 58:52.720]  Yeah. Yeah.
[58:53.280 --> 58:58.080]  Oh my God. The great, the best tour that I never saw because I was too young was when
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.240]  it was like a couple of years before the Wilburys Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
[59:02.240 --> 59:08.000]  toured the country as Dylan's band, which was, I was old enough to see that.
[59:10.800 --> 59:12.320]  You son of a bitch, honestly.
[59:12.320 --> 59:15.280]  Yeah. Tom Petty is an opening band.
[59:15.280 --> 59:15.780]  Yeah.
[59:16.480 --> 59:17.680]  There's your first clue.
[59:17.680 --> 59:23.440]  Tom Petty is, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers has an opening band and then a truly great
[59:23.440 --> 59:29.360]  musicians playing his backup to Bob Dylan. Unbelievable. But anyway, I digress, but I,
[59:29.360 --> 59:32.000]  I don't listen to lyrics and music. I really don't. I couldn't tell you.
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.520]  The only bad part of that show is a guy, a couple rows back from me,
[59:35.520 --> 59:38.560]  like every five minutes would go, Bobby, Bobby, you're so fine.
[59:38.560 --> 59:40.080]  Bobby, Bobby, you blow my mind.
[59:40.720 --> 59:41.220]  Bobby.
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  Some people, I don't know why some people pay for concert tickets. I really don't.
[59:46.000 --> 59:47.680]  His problem was he paid for beer.
[59:50.080 --> 59:53.200]  It's very expensive beer. It's like going to the ballpark for beer.
[59:53.200 --> 59:53.840]  Oh yeah.
[59:54.880 --> 59:58.880]  Seventeen dollars for a beer. Sure. That's a good deal. I don't even like baseball. I'm here.
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.160]  Yeah. Money left over. You can get a t-shirt.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.120]  I'm here for the food. I'm here for the hot dogs. I just don't see the foldable thing happening.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.160]  I really don't or not soon. Well, I think eventually I think it needs a total,
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.600]  total revolution in screen technology, battery technology to get it to a size.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.040]  It's the connector, the connector between the two things is, is, is a problem. It's like that
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:33.040]  hinge is there and it's got a lot of electronics in it. I could see Apple doing something like with
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.480]  their Bluetooth chips, right? Basically having two phones that talk to each other over Bluetooth
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.840]  connection that's super fast and there's something like that, right? It's going to be, it's going to
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:52.640]  be, it's the typical Apple way doing something that they see could be useful, but not like
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.640]  everybody's thought about it. Like the headset now, right? It's just, it's just a different take.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:06.880]  It's more thought out. Are you noodling on ideas for the headset?
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.440]  Well, we might as well segue to it. Are you, are you, are you looking at the SDK yet or?
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:21.920]  I haven't. I, I honestly, I need to wear one before I can even start thinking about it. It's
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.880]  like the, the it's, you know, I see a lot of people coming up with these interactions and thinking
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.040]  that, Oh, what I'm seeing in the simulator is going to be like, what, when I'm wearing this
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:36.240]  thing on my head and it might be, I may be wrong there, but it's like, I didn't really get the
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:43.120]  iPhone until it was in my hand. I really did not understand the iPhone until I did that swipe down
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:51.200]  lock. And then it was like, Oh my God. Right. I spent six months extremely excited about the
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.520]  iPhone before. Yeah. Yeah. That's where I'm at right now with the division things. Like I'm
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:01.600]  dying to try it. You know, you're lucky that you have tried it. You've had that taste of it,
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.720]  right? You haven't actually gone about your day with it. There's a big difference there.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.320]  Yeah. Guided through it. And it's not 30 minutes. Isn't quite enough to start thinking like,
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.960]  Oh, you know, what would really be a killer app? What I would love to have on it now. I don't know
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.000]  yet. I don't know. Yeah. You have to use something to do. And the Macintosh was the same way back in
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.440]  the eighties. There's no doubt about it. Even if you saw the appeal or if you were just curious,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.960]  I mean, and you and I remember very vividly, it actually was, I would say close to a decade
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:44.880]  from 1984 to maybe 93, 94, where there were still these diehards who thought that a command line
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.600]  interface was the only way real computers would work and that a GUI was for babies. I mean,
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:58.400]  you really can't believe how long into the GUI era that there were people, serious, serious,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.880]  mostly men who really, really were going to die on that hill. But even if you were just curious
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:09.040]  about it, if you were like, huh, that seems like an interesting way to do a computer, you really
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.520]  had to use it before you would come up with an idea for writing software for the Macintosh.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.880]  Even if you thought, I can't wait to try that. That seems really interesting to have two documents
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.200]  open in these overlapping windows and you could just click between them. Boy, that would be,
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.560]  that was a hard problem to solve in the command line days, the text only screen days.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:37.040]  Yeah. It's a weird multi-terminal thing. You could switch between basically 24 by 40, 80.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.720]  Yeah. 24 by 80 screens. It was a hack.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.720]  Yeah. You could have like two buffers in Emacs or something like that.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.520]  It was weird. That's the thing that the windows solve. And having windows floating in space,
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.440]  that's going to solve some problems, but I don't know what those problems are yet.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.320]  Yeah. I don't know either.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.280]  Another thing that concerns me about VisionOS is nobody's really talking about this. It's going
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:08.080]  to be a tiny market, right? There aren't going to be a lot of people buying these things initially.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.720]  And from what I'm seeing, the development for this platform, it's, yeah, you can leverage some
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:22.640]  of your knowledge about how UIKit or SwiftUI works, but it really is a new thing. It's like,
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.840]  oh, I'm going to take my Mac app and run it on the iPhone. No, you're not.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.400]  No.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.440]  You're going to take my iPhone app and run it on VisionOS. It's like,
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.560]  you may think so now, but no, you're not.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.640]  Right. The closest that's going to come to be true, I think, although this is one of the features
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:49.840]  they didn't let us experience a month ago, is the just run all of macOS. You run an external display
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:56.000]  for your MacBook in a big window in front of you in VisionOS. Assuming that it works as well as
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.120]  they say it's going to work and that it's going to be like the equivalent of like a 4 to 5K
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.520]  virtual display in front of you. That is going to be...
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.480]  That could be killer.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.680]  But the Mac developers have to do nothing. It's literally just a display. So literally,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.480]  there is nothing to do. There's no, there's not even like a WWDC session, like, oh,
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.640]  ways to optimize your Mac app for... No, it's just a virtual display for your Mac. So like...
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.720]  It's like running a VLC session on a Mac mini or whatever.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:33.440]  It's across the room. It's just not... It's going to... And with a good keyboard and some other...
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.840]  I mean, you're not going to probably want to hold your hand up or even pinch your wrist around all
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.640]  day. You're going to want to use some other kind of trackpad or a mouse even.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.440]  Yeah. It makes me wonder whether there's a market for somebody like a third... Because I don't think
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.760]  Apple would do it, but it would be interesting to see if... And maybe somebody makes something
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.600]  like this now. I just don't know about it. But like a portable track keyboard and trackpad,
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:06.240]  that's one piece. So it's one thing to connect via Bluetooth to your Mac. And I don't know.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.840]  I'm not quite sure what people are going to do.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.480]  Sort of like the smart keyboard, but without having to hook it up to another device.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:19.360]  Or maybe what travelers will do is just use their MacBook and open it up and use the MacBook
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:25.040]  keyboard and trackpad, but not use the display even though it's open, which is kind of weird.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:31.360]  Right? I've only thought about this in the last week or two. That's kind of weird. So imagine,
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:38.640]  all right, I go to next year's WWDC and I have a Vision Pro headset and I'm in my hotel room
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:47.760]  to write up my keynote thoughts for next year's WWDC. And I want to use the big virtual Mac
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:55.360]  display through the headset. And the only keyboard I have is my MacBook Pro. Isn't it weird to open
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.600]  my MacBook Pro and use that keyboard and trackpad while I'm looking at a display in the headset and
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.760]  not looking at the display? And would my... Yeah, there will have to be some sort of
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:11.280]  accessories. The other it sucks case is being on an airplane, right? You want something that
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.680]  you can put down on the tray table and not have to worry about the screen hitting the
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.520]  seat in front of you. Well, I think, see there, I think it's almost easier because then you could
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.640]  just open your MacBook and not even open it 90 degrees, right? Just open it enough so that it's
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:31.040]  on and ignore the MacBook display. Have it... Your hands are not as big as mine.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.560]  As often discussed on this podcast.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:49.280]  A reminder of the fleshy palm. Let me just take another break here. I'll thank our next sponsor
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:55.840]  for the day. And it is our good friends at Squarespace. I keep saying this. Squarespace
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:02.960]  is, I think, certainly the most frequent sponsor of this show. But probably the longest running
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.400]  consecutive. They're a great company. They've actually just shipped a bunch of new features.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.880]  They have some tremendous new features. Their platform keeps going forward, but they've really,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:19.680]  really upped their game in terms of the WYSIWYG aspect of building and tweaking your site.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.640]  So if you've looked at Squarespace in the last couple of years,
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.800]  it's worth looking again because they've really added a bunch of new stuff that's just terrific.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.800]  But it really, to me, the big takeaway with Squarespace and setting up your own website
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:41.280]  for yourself, for your company, your business or your friend's business, if you know a friend with
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.960]  a small business, but they're not the sort of technical minded person who can build a website.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:51.600]  Having your own presence on the internet that you control, your domain name, your website,
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.880]  as opposed to relying entirely on these platforms like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and Reddit
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.840]  or whatever else you might be, we just keep learning the lesson and lesson over and over
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:12.800]  again that controlling your own presence online has so much value. And for anybody, whether you
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:20.160]  are technically inclined or not, doing it through Squarespace is such an easy way to do it with the
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.360]  with the highest quality in terms of the responsiveness of the website, the design
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.640]  of the website, the amount of features, the sort of things like a blog or hosting a podcast
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.840]  or hosting your own store or using Squarespace to sell and book your time as like a consultant
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.480]  or a trainer or something like that. That's all built in. They have features like this
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.480]  on Squarespace and you're in control of it. Nobody's going to come in and
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:54.080]  and pull the rug out from under you. It's your website under your control. And it's just the
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:00.720]  value of that in 2023 had to me has never been more clear. And it's just terrific. What else can
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.160]  I tell you about Squarespace? The Fluid Engine is their next generation website design that I
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.640]  talked about. It has never been easier for anyone to unlock their creativity. You start with a best

[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.160]  them highly enough. My thanks to Squarespace for their continuing sponsorship of this podcast.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:33.600]  Great, great company. What else do we want to talk about? I wanted to ask you, what are you working
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:41.680]  on this summer with iOS 17, iPad OS 17? Oh, the whole thing with the interactive widgets.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:47.680]  Yeah. That to me is a bigger deal than I think a lot of people realize.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:54.800]  Widgets in the past have been just sort of like screenshots of data, right? They've just been like
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:01.040]  pictures of the state of your app, right? It's on the home screen. And interacting with those
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:07.120]  meant tapping on and going to the app. And there wasn't really any kind of story there to stay just
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.200]  on your lock screen or on your home screen. Right.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.400]  And now with the interactive widgets, they've done something really clever.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.880]  I don't want to say this wasn't a hard thing to implement, but there was a lot of cleverness
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:31.040]  involved. To explain a little bit how widgets work, it's sort of like a zip archive of an HTML page,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.880]  right? You lay out the page and you take a zip file of it. And then later on the system decides,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:44.000]  oh, I'm going to display this widget and take the zip file and unpack it and put it on the display.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.280]  What they've done now is the ability to have some interaction there that calls
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:58.880]  a thing that's sort of like a shortcut, lets your app do something, right? It can do anything.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:04.320]  In fact, the thing that I'm looking at is in Trio, the ability to play radio stations,
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.120]  right? From the lock screen, you just see a button for a station that you like,
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:14.960]  you tap on that button and it starts playing the radio station, right? I'm sure the music app will
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.400]  get a similar kind of treatment, starting and stopping tracks without having to open up the
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.720]  music app and dig through and find the player. I see a lot of opportunities there for developers
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:32.320]  to make the widgets just come alive. And I think it's a great little thing that they've done.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.360]  The side effect of this, I think is even kind of probably better in the long term is that
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.840]  it's going to, the way you do this is doing by something that's sort of like a little shortcut,
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.560]  right? And it's going to expose a lot of developers to the shortcuts technology.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:52.160]  So like that button that's on your widget that he says, Oh, play this radio station. Well,
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.480]  I'm obviously going to write a shortcut that says, play this radio station, right? So you
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:05.200]  can automate that. So like if I go into my focus mode or if I get home, it starts playing the radio
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:12.080]  station on the kitchen home pod. And that's for me, the thing that really is powerful because it
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:19.360]  takes that interaction and makes it something that you can use throughout your life, right?
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:26.160]  That's for me, the most interesting thing. In fact, while we're talking about VisionOS and all
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.640]  these other things, it's like interactions that fit into your life are the really, that's the
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:40.000]  goal. That's the thing I've loved doing the most. Yeah, that's very interesting because that's an
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.200]  area like I was keenly interested in that part of the keynote, but I haven't really played with
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:54.000]  widgets yet that much. Like most of my iOS 17 time this summer has been on my iPad because I
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.040]  just recklessly throw betas on my iPad because it's like I have a spare iPhone with the beta,
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.560]  but I don't use my spare iPhone that much. I don't put the betas on my Mac because my
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.440]  Mac needs to be stable and consistent for work. Therefore, I just put it beta on my iPad and I
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.240]  don't care if like last week before the latest beta, there was one day where I don't know what
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.040]  happened, but I felt that it was warm. I was like, huh, my iPad's really warm. I guess I should turn
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.120]  it off, but I didn't, but it was charging. And then the next time I went to it, it was dead.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.440]  So it was using energy so quickly that it died while it was plugged in.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.960]  You don't want that happening on your phone for sure. I kind of screwed myself with the iPhone
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.320]  yearly purchase thing. It's like, oh, I got a new iPhone every year, but I have to send the
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.320]  old one back. And now I don't have any phones that run iOS 16 and iOS 17.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.840]  I don't think that thing that happened to my iPad would have happened if the USB plug was
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.720]  right into the iPad, it was connected to a magic keyboard and the plug was in the keyboard. And
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.880]  I think the, I didn't have enough juice. I think the iPad was just like, Hey, I give up. I'm too
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:06.320]  hot. I'm giving up and like, wasn't charging, whatever. But the widget thing is interesting,
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:14.480]  but like you said, they here to four through, I, you know, iOS 16, while the widgets can present
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.280]  lots of information. And if you make a big one, like a calendar widget for fantastic Cal or
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.520]  Apple's calendar or weather widgets, everybody's got weather widgets. You can have an information,
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:33.600]  visually information, rich presentation, but the whole widget is just a button to launch the app
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:40.560]  in terms of interactivity. So no matter how big the widget, it's all just one big button to just
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.600]  go to the app to do anything else. Yeah. And I think it gets really interesting when you start
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:51.680]  thinking about standby that where you put the phone in the landscape orientation and you get
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:17:00.160]  the widgets and imagine like a this is kind of my dream, right? Is having a clock and then next to
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.920]  it, a button that starts a radio station, right? So I listen to music while I'm going to bed and
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.520]  have that thing turn off after 30 minutes or whatever. It's just, there are going to be a
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.120]  lot of interesting things that happen because of that just, and it really is just two things,
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:23.920]  right? The only interactive points are a toggle switch and a button. And the buttons can send
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.040]  some piece of information over to your app that says, oh, okay, you want to go to station X. Good.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:37.520]  I'll start a station X. It's not complicated, but it's loaded with possibilities. That's always a
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.720]  good thing. Do you think I'm on the right track here that part of Apple's effort on this regard
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:49.520]  with widgets on the lock screen in particular and with standby, it's taken to a new degree
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:55.840]  because you don't even have to like, it's always on with, with the right iPhone hardware. That's
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.800]  this. I think it's always on with all. Oh, maybe because it's on the charger, right? If it's not
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:10.240]  on a charger, maybe not, but I wasn't sure if all existing, all iPhones eligible for iOS 17 have a
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:16.480]  screen that won't burn in. I don't know about that, but no, but if you're not have that little
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:22.480]  red mode, right? Yeah. It reduces the, the light reduces then. So it's not going to be blaring.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:30.400]  Well, if it's not all iPhones this year, sooner rather than later, all iPhones that run iOS
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.040]  will have this feature. But if you're not familiar, it's the feature where if it's connected to a
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:41.840]  MagSafe charger, and I think it has to be MagSafe and you put the phone horizontally, you get this
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:47.440]  new mode where you can have the time. And like you said, like you can show a handful of widgets
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:54.000]  on the screen and they can do stuff now. And to me, it's almost like coming full circle where
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.880]  like you even referenced it when we were talking about the original iPhone. And when you first did
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:06.160]  slide to unlock the original iPhone, it, it, we, we all seem so naive that we didn't have passcodes
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:13.760]  on our iPhones, but, but the way that's wild, right? But the original idea was, and you could,
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:19.440]  I think even the original iPhone did have a preference. You could turn on to put a passcode
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.400]  on it, but the, yeah, once, once we had enough important data on it, right. That was the other
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.800]  thing, right? Initially, like all we had were a couple of notes and you know, the original
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:35.360]  idea was you would hit, hit the home button to wake up the screen and then just slide to unlock
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:42.960]  and boom, you're in. And, but like the whole phone in 2007, 2008 was sort of widget-y, right? It's
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:49.840]  like, it was sort of like, Oh, it's the design was inspired by the macOS dashboard. Yes, absolutely
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.000]  right. The calculator looked in and the weather calculate seen this before. Yeah. The calculator
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.280]  and the weather. And I think in the keynote in January, 2007, they even called them widgets.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.160]  They, I think they were unsure whether they'd call them apps or widgets as excited as we were
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:11.840]  about it. Nobody really thought, Oh, this is going to grow to the point where somebody's main
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.720]  computer could be their iPhone or only computer. Right. And there's a lot of people, a lot of
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.560]  serious like business people who do all of their computing on their phones. They really do because
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:28.640]  that's the nature of their work and it does what they need. But with widgets like lock screen
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:34.000]  widgets, and especially the way they're evolving in iOS 17, it's sort of like Apple's taken us
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:44.080]  back to the point where some safe private sliver of what we do on our phones, you could do without
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:49.120]  unlocking it and going into the full iOS experience. Like here's a couple of things.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.120]  There are a lot of things on the phone that I don't care if somebody starts a music station
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:21:01.520]  in triode and then my phone is locked. Yeah. It's a what? If it's a calorie counter, maybe,
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:08.640]  but yeah. It's up to you to put it on your lock screen though. Right. Yes. Right. One of the
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:14.080]  things that's really cool about the standby is that it actually knows the MagSafe charger that
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.920]  it's hooked up to. So if you have one in your bedroom and you have one in your office and maybe
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:26.560]  have one in the kitchen, the other side benefit here is that nobody's going to care what their
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:31.200]  battery level is anymore because it's always going to be charged. Right. Right. Right. Because when
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:35.840]  you sit down... Planes are going to have these things now too, right? Yeah. When you sit down,
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.600]  yeah. I'm looking forward to it. I was just talking with my friends at Studio Neat who
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.000]  make some really cool... I forget the name of their docs. That's my only thing. It's like,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.800]  I got to get a new Studio Neat because I've got to do the AirPods, the watch, and the phone now,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:59.680]  and it's got to be propped up right. I've got the one that lays flat now. But yeah. And it's funny
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:08.560]  because where I first realized that MagSafe is more than a dumb puck was when using Apple's
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:15.520]  MagSafe cases, the indicator for, hey, you've got a MagSafe connection is color coordinated with
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.720]  the case. So if you put a purple case on your phone and you connect it to MagSafe, you get a
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:27.680]  purple indicator. Yeah. I did not make that connection at all. Yeah. That's pretty cool.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.720]  Yeah. So there's... So when Apple thinks ahead, you got to give it to them. They really do...
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:38.880]  In fact, this whole... The widgets thing, they put a lot of the pieces in place last year with
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:47.200]  iOS 16. And they could not have done this year without last year. It really is. And there's...
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:54.080]  I can see some stuff now in iOS 17 that's not quite right, and I know they'll fix it next year.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.320]  But you can think about it. Just off the top of your head, the sort of things you'd want
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:06.480]  on a standby screen are very different bedside than... Yeah. Kitchen. You want to see... I don't
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.840]  care what my calendar is when I'm going to bed. Right. Whereas on your kitchen counter,
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.960]  you might have something entirely different. Lots of timers. Lots of timers. And at your desk,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:23.520]  yeah, you want your calendar. Very interesting. I don't have tons of thoughts about iOS 17,
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:29.520]  but the one that really jumps out to me on the iPad is the new autocorrect that they talked
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:38.080]  about being driven by some new AI, blah, blah, blah. It's the real deal. It is really, really
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.960]  good. I'm looking forward to that if that's true, because it can't get worse. I've told the
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:49.040]  chickenberry story before, right? It's not a pleasant thing to use. So I've tinkered with it
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:55.680]  with a spare phone and it's similar, but on the iPad, even with the magic keyboard where I'm
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.920]  typing on a hardware keyboard and normally I don't think, hey, when I have a good hardware keyboard,
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.280]  I very seldom think I wish I could type faster. I've often said I'm sort of a crummy typist
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:16.480]  because I'm a slow thinker. And at some point in my late teenage years, I learned to type as fast
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:22.560]  as I can think. And it's not a very high typing speed, but if I can type as fast as I think,
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:28.320]  that's fast enough. But I'm finding myself like, ooh, yeah, that's the big long word. Somehow I
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.600]  just started typing I-M and it's guessing I wanted impossible. That's exactly what I wanted. You just
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:40.880]  hit the space bar and boom, you're on the next word. It is really smart. And it's also in Sonoma
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  too, right? Like text edit and things like that. Yeah, I hope it's not in Xcode. I do not want
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.000]  spelling corrections in Xcode. I just love them in text edit.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.280]  You know what though? But all the other IDEs that have like the copilot stuff,
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.640]  it's going to get there. You don't want the same auto completion in Xcode that you want anywhere
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:13.040]  else. But I think there's existence proof in like VS code with copilot integration that something
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:20.160]  like this is going to be ubiquitous. There's that word again in code editors too, including Xcode
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:27.840]  eventually. It's really good and really smart. And I can't think of one single way that it's worse.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.760]  It is as good or better than the old auto complete system in every way. And I think it's a lot better
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:40.880]  in a lot of ways. It just really seems to narrow in on the one guess that makes the most sense
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.800]  contextually over and over and over again. And if it is wrong, you lose nothing because you just
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.920]  keep typing the word you actually wanted. There's no... Also, it doesn't get in your way. It's not
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:58.560]  like a forced change. No, no. That's for me. Because of the big hands again,
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.440]  my thumb often hits the space bar in the middle of typing a word, and it splits the word,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:13.600]  and I end up with this gibberish. I could be underestimating how much it's doing the post
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.880]  typing the end of the word correction. I guess that's the difference. What I'm impressed by is
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:26.320]  less auto correcting what you did type and more all about the auto completion of what you're
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:33.760]  about to type. And I find that to be way more satisfying. Like if you're typing the word
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:40.160]  impossible, because where are your eyes? I am. You're looking at the blinking insertion point
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:48.400]  after the M. And when you see a light gray possible, you know it's right, and then you
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.240]  just hit the space bar, and you get the P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E with just typing the space bar.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:02.480]  Auto complete is to me way better than auto correction, because you're already knowing
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.160]  what you're gonna get. Right? It's an aid. Yeah. My understanding of it is that it's
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.200]  doing the AI kind of thing. Although Apple will never call it AI. It's machine learning.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:19.120]  But it's basically working off a corpus of information. So if you say that's I am,
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.640]  that could be that's impulsive, that's impossible. But if you go further back,
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:34.400]  and it's like, I saw this, and that's impossible. That's not impulsive. So it's got more context,
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:41.760]  I think. Yeah. And that is really the key, because that whole on machine, on device
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.280]  mechanism that they had, it's like you make a spelling error once, and you live with it the
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:55.840]  rest of your life. I really do. And I wish I'd spent more time. I wish I had more time with the
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.480]  phone with iOS 17. But I'm impressed with what I've seen so far, and it is the same. It's this
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:07.440]  completion. And I really do think it's to me the biggest, we're up to iOS 17th version of the OS
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:14.080]  17th year. And to me, it is the single biggest improvement to this since the the very first
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:21.920]  iPhone. I mean, it's gotten copy and paste. Well, no, but I think it's, I'm just saying
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.360]  just thumb typing alone. Oh, I'm just in the keyboard domain. Yeah, just in the keyboard
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:33.840]  domain. I can't say it's better than copy and paste. I mean, that was pretty frustrating.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:41.840]  Gosh, that was nasty. Was it iOS 3 that we had to wait for, or was it 4? It was at least iOS 3.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:46.320]  It was a couple years, right. And it was one of the things he knew was coming,
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.760]  but he knew it had to be right. And it's been right for 15 years now or whatever.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.080]  I'm really surprised, though. I'm not surprised it wasn't in the first year,
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:01.280]  but I was very surprised that it wasn't in iOS or iPhone OS as we called it then, too.
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.200]  Yeah, but you know, if Apple needs more time to get something right, they do it.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.120]  And there was so much to be done, really. I mean, honestly, I mean, in between
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.560]  iOS 1 and 2 was the whole, hey, App Store, which turned into kind of a big thing.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:27.920]  You think? Too big, yeah. I'm trying to think. Was there anything else? I know. I mean,
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.800]  we could probably do a whole year worth of shows in the year ahead talking about new features.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.320]  Just talking about the App Store? Well, no, talking about iOS 17 features.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.200]  Well, the recent 15-year anniversary of the App Store, that's a pretty big deal.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.640]  Yeah. And here we are waiting for, we spend the whole week waiting to figure out what
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:54.880]  Twitter is going to call their app, given the rule with two character or more letter app names.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:04.560]  I guarantee you, Apple has never had to deal with an editor's choice being removed. That is just
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.280]  incredible. So we're bringing the show full circle here as we close it down.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.480]  Oh, that's true. Yeah.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:16.960]  But that is true. You pointed this out. So Twitter's app had won an Editor's Choice Award,
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:24.640]  which really is like an ADA, right? That's a big deal. That is for a software developer or a team
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:32.880]  or a company. That is like a seal of quality. Your app has made it. That's a good thing.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.880]  And the X app does not have an Editor's Choice Award now.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.240]  No, it's gone.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:43.600]  Let's see. Let's make sure it's gone. Let's see. Oh, also searching for X does not get you to the
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:55.440]  app. All right. Let me tell you what I got. I got in order and surprisingly not an ad at the top.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:01.920]  I can't believe that. Maybe Apple shut that off. I don't know. I've got XVPN, Xbox,
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:12.720]  Ibis Paint X, Zender, X-E-N-D-E-R, Xtreme Motorbikes, then Xfinity. Speaking of X logos,
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.760]  I've been wondering, everybody's talking about these patents that are trademarks that Microsoft
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:28.000]  and Meta have on social networking related to the letter X. And it's complicated because none of
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.120]  them really say we own the letter X. It's more about like marks. Of all the companies that might
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:40.160]  be the most worried about somebody using X as a logo mark, to me, it's not Meta and Microsoft.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.960]  It's Comcast with Xfinity.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:51.280]  Well, the other thing I did the other day is I did a search at the US Patent and Trademark Office,
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:59.920]  and there are like 2,600 different word marks registered for X, just the letter X. So it's
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:05.040]  a popular thing. And the problem there again is because everybody uses it, it doesn't really mean
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:11.440]  anything, right? Twitter meant something. Twitter was a unique thing, right? It's like,
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:17.120]  would Facebook go and call Instagram I? No.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:23.520]  Well, here's what I see when I search for Twitter. I get a paid ad at the top. That's the blue app
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:31.600]  for Facebook. And then the next is an app called Twitter with the X logo, still not renamed. Third
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:38.800]  is Tweetbot for Twitter. So let's see, is the editor's choice back? Nope, it is gone.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:45.840]  Yeah. Well, and the wording of it, it's like it said, we rely on Twitter to keep us,
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:51.120]  to help us express our thoughts and keep up with the news. And with Twitter's Apple TV app,
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:56.640]  our 2016 app of the year, we've also got a bigger window into current events and topical
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:03.280]  discussions. From breaking news, tweets, to live video feeds, and even Thursday Night Football,
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.400]  the benefits of the little bird are always getting bigger. And you go and replace all
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:15.840]  those things, tweets and Twitter and bird with something X, and it just sounds that we're back
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.800]  to the Mad Libs. It just makes no sense at all. It sounds like a deranged person wrote it.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.240]  It's like, we're going to X the X and X X with X.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:31.600]  Or like I said, like a Mad Lib. And Apple really does, because the editor's choice,
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.160]  they don't give them out willy-nilly. They really do write them. And somebody, the famous-
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.880]  Yeah, there's care in putting into it.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.400]  Well, famously, they hired a lot of people who used to be well-known as writers at Macworld,
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.200]  amongst other publications. A lot of people with professional writing backgrounds have been working
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.800]  at Apple for a long time.
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:59.120]  Yeah, they do a great job. Apple, the App Store editorial team, whenever they ask you anything,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.880]  it's like, oh, we're thinking about doing a feature on X. It's like, you've got all my time,
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.520]  right? Because I know you do the right thing. They do a great job with the input from developers.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:12.160]  Oh, I read them. I mean, I really do.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.360]  Yeah, exactly. It's interesting. It's worthwhile.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.880]  Not just when they're profiling my friends. I read them when they profile other developers too. And
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.720]  I've learned an awful lot of interesting stories about small development teams through the profiles
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:34.800]  in the App Store. But if they didn't, if Apple ran this editorially in a very lazy fashion,
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.600]  and they had sort of a fill-in-the-blanks template for an Editor's Choice Award,
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:46.640]  maybe they would make Xs those blanks. Oh, we use X because we X the X.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.560]  And it's easy for X because all they got to do is submit the form with no change.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:35:08.800]  Yeah. It's entertaining. The level of incompetence, it's actually entertaining.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:16.960]  But it's starting to reach a point where that entertainment value, it's like a dumb thing
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:23.680]  can only stay interesting and funny for so long. And then it's just going to be like, yeah, whatever.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.600]  You know what? Everything like that has a shorter expiration date than you think. Remember the Robert
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:36.560]  Morton Downey Jr.? Remember that guy? He was a talk show host in the 80s. And he literally smoked
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:44.560]  cigarettes. And sort of invented the Jerry Springer style of like, let's have people on
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.840]  stage get their divorce live on TV, sort of. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember that now.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:58.640]  It was really tawdry. And it was like, boy, there are people like this. Oh, God. Look at him. What
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.680]  is he doing? And then it's like, oh, that's that show. Oh, yeah, I'm going to skip that.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.600]  I will put a note in the show notes. Hopefully, I'll find a clip on YouTube for you youngsters
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:13.360]  who don't remember. But he came out of nowhere. It was an afternoon TV sensation. And then like
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:18.080]  two years later, it was off the air. It's patience wears thin with stuff like that.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:22.640]  Craig, I enjoy the beach. I don't want to hold you up too much longer.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:28.720]  Yeah, the water's been awesome. It sounded in the low 70s. Just yeah,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.960]  I'll probably go take a I'm probably going to do a long swim today. Well, half mile or so.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.120]  Enjoy it before it gets to be like the water off the coast of Florida jacuzzi level.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:45.680]  Yeah, believe me. There I go again, laughing at things that are really not funny. But
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:53.120]  yeah, well, I did last week. I was in Tucson, Arizona, where it was high, high temperatures
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.160]  for all the four or five days we were there. Well, it was over one hundred and fifteen.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.120]  Did you see the thing? I know this sounds incredible. It sounds made up, but there are
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:07.680]  the I swear to God I was listening to I think it was on the Keith Olbermann podcast where there
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.240]  was a news story this week. I don't know if it was Tucson or somewhere else in Arizona,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.360]  but the hospital's burn unit was filled up. It had no more beds because
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:25.680]  the normal number of regular burn victims. But then the the rest of the unit was filled
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.280]  up by people who'd fallen and been burned by the macadam or the pavement. And yeah,
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.640]  and that you could you could get like a third degree burn with 15 seconds of exposure or
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:42.000]  something like that. I mean, it was ridiculous. So like anybody who has a dog in Tucson in those
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.200]  conditions that they put they put shoes on them. The shoes are meant for like dogs that are walking
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:55.760]  through snow and ice. And if you've ever noticed, I guess the hottest pavement I've ever experienced
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.600]  is in Vegas, obviously very hot in the summertime. But they said that the surface temperature of
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:08.960]  asphalt was 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter what Fahrenheit Celsius,
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.600]  I don't know, 180. That's a burn. Well, it starts to get sticky, too, right? You can feel it as
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:20.480]  you're walking. This is not right. I'm unbelievable fall on the ground and go to the burn unit. I
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:27.440]  mean, that's things we never thought we'd see again. Anyway, 70 degrees sounds absolutely
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.040]  beautiful for the water temperature. Thanks. Say hello to all your friends at the icon factory.
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.000]  It's always a pleasure. I will talk to you soon. I can go to iconfactoryapps.com and
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.400]  see all our stuff. There will be a link in the show notes, including to Triode,
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:47.920]  which we've mentioned several times, I guess. Yeah, that's going to be a big release in
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.800]  September. That's awesome. For people who don't know, I don't know, did we just say it? I think
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.320]  we kind of hinted at it. Well, it kind of obliquely, yeah. It's an internet radio app. It's
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:08.320]  not scummy, no ads, no bullshit. Just, you know, here's a stream, listen to it. And what gets me
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.040]  through my work day every day. And well, and for something you listen to, like everything,
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:19.280]  every product from Icon Factory, pretty to look at, too. Yeah, yeah. It also, I listen to it in
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.480]  the living room on the TV, TV OS, listen to it on my Mac, listen to it on my phone. It's just,
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:30.880]  it's, there's that word again. It's ubiquitous. Anyway, and my thanks also to our sponsors for
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.200]  the show, our good friends at Squarespace, where you can build your own website and Backblaze,
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.080]  where you can get online backup for your Mac or PC for seven bucks a month. My thanks to them.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:52.880]  Thank you, Craig. Yep. It's been a pleasure, John. Talk to you later.
