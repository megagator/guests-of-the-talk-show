[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You sound wonderful. Do you have a new microphone?
[00:02.520 --> 00:08.320]  No, I know I actually you know, I probably have the blackjack since the last time we talked I got a two by two
[00:08.480 --> 00:11.680]  Yeah, that's exactly what I have. It's nice. I like it
[00:11.720 --> 00:16.880]  I've only had occasional occurrences where it turns me into a Dalek, but otherwise, it's fine
[00:18.040 --> 00:20.880]  My thing is that I took I got the thing set up where?
[00:21.520 --> 00:26.280]  If I apparently sound okay, and then I took a picture of all these crazy dials
[00:26.280 --> 00:29.120]  If I ever lose that picture, I'm screwed
[00:29.800 --> 00:33.080]  You're just like I need to commit this to memory make Jonas memorize it
[00:33.080 --> 00:35.480]  I have no idea what any of this stuff means
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.760]  It's so it's very confusing to me, especially that all the extra buttons the in and out. It's like oh, yeah
[00:40.920 --> 00:45.720]  There's there are too many especially if you're only have one mic set up and you're not using the input monitor
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.520]  And it's just going into your computer. There's there's a lot more than you actually need there
[00:49.520 --> 00:52.800]  Yeah, I think that as I get older, I'm really rocketing towards
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.880]  demanding
[00:54.880 --> 01:01.160]  Extreme simplicity and everything I use but it's like the podcast I do enough podcasts where it really is worth it for me to sound
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.600]  As good as I possibly can and so I gave up on my beloved just plug it into a USB
[01:07.160 --> 01:13.120]  Microphone, you know, which I loved in theory, but everybody agrees that ever since I switched to this I sound better
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.360]  So yeah, the the mixers mixers make everything sound great. Although I did find a lightning USB mic
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.360]  That's not terrible that I've been using recently on the road. So that's my that's my good backup for now
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.560]  So what do you all right? All right, let's let's consider this part of the show. So I like lightning
[01:29.440 --> 01:33.480]  What would what what does that mean? You mean like podcasting from like an iPad?
[01:34.280 --> 01:36.080]  yeah, I
[01:36.080 --> 01:38.400]  podcasting from an iPad is still a pain in the ass, but
[01:39.120 --> 01:42.780]  Being able to record your audio on the go is really helpful
[01:43.840 --> 01:49.720]  previous to that I had like a little tiny lav mic that you'd plug into the headphones of your iPhone jack and it was just
[01:49.720 --> 01:57.560]  You know, it was better than talking on your iPhone, but not by much and I accidentally drowned my MacBook Air
[01:57.560 --> 02:03.200]  So my iPad is the only portable computer I have right now, which is kind of terrifying. Wait, which one did you drown?
[02:03.200 --> 02:11.080]  I drown my MacBook Air. No, my poor 11-inch MacBook Air was sitting next to my MacBook Pro or my my my iPad, bro
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.240]  And yeah bad things happened. I guess I do have a 15-inch MacBook Pro
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.080]  That's like six years old at this point, but I haven't booted it on and in like two years. Oh
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.040]  Man, so what are you gonna do? This is like a bad time to replace a MacBook. Yeah, exactly
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.000]  So I'm like, well, I've got the iPad Pro and I was making all this
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.600]  Hey about yeah, I do most of my work on it, which is true
[02:30.600 --> 02:36.400]  I do do a lot of like my portable work on the iPad now, but I was still like oh god now
[02:36.400 --> 02:39.440]  I have no safety net. Yeah more on that later. Yes
[02:39.440 --> 02:46.160]  we'll talk we'll talk about that later, but yeah, but I but um, but podcasting mics, so I tried the
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.320]  The Shure for a while and that that thing is a beautiful mic
[02:50.400 --> 02:56.080]  That is absolutely horrible because it requires a very it requires a specific app and it just it won't work
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.920]  If you just plug it into the iPad you have to open like the Shure app or GarageBand and anything else just like nope
[03:02.920 --> 03:07.000]  I don't recognize you as a microphone. Sorry, you don't get to work which is infuriating
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.120]  Um, so I got what's it called?
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.080]  Now I have to find it. I
[03:13.760 --> 03:15.240]  picked up the
[03:15.240 --> 03:21.520]  The Apogee not the not the Apogee one the one of its one of the little ones that's like 200 bucks
[03:22.200 --> 03:28.440]  From the Apple Store on a whim and I love it. It's so good and it works for everything. Hmm
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.280]  So I'm I this is like one of those things where I I don't know maybe I'm just an idiot
[03:34.280 --> 03:37.920]  but it's whenever I read about people trying to podcast from
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.480]  An iPad I get very confused and so I get in some ways
[03:44.480 --> 03:48.280]  It's I guess simpler than podcasting from a Mac and that you know
[03:48.280 --> 03:54.320]  All the multitasking involved in the different apps and everything. I have installed to do this in some ways is more complicated
[03:54.320 --> 03:59.360]  But because the Mac can do so many things at the same time and you don't have to worry about which app is frontmost or
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.120]  Whatever and you can run
[04:01.120 --> 04:04.240]  Things, you know dirty little hacks like call recorder for Skype
[04:05.240 --> 04:08.680]  To me. It just makes sense. It's like just totally makes sense
[04:08.680 --> 04:12.280]  And when I in and supposedly I still didn't go back and watch the video
[04:12.280 --> 04:16.920]  But I heard that in the event last month when when Phil Schuler said now you can podcast, you know
[04:16.920 --> 04:20.040]  This is great for podcasters that they they cut to me in the audience
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.760]  Oh, yeah, they cut to the whole section of just right everybody being like what?
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.840]  Right. Yeah, I don't know if that app that app if the accessory really makes it easier for podcasters
[04:30.840 --> 04:36.680]  If you have it makes it easier to run your powered microphones sure, but it doesn't actually fix the core
[04:37.200 --> 04:38.640]  podcasting problem on iOS
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.680]  Which is what you were just talking about the fact that like there is really no support for core audio
[04:43.880 --> 04:48.920]  And for background app like multi multi threading audio throughout apps
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.840]  So like if you're going to record if you're gonna do a podcast on an iPad if you're doing it locally
[04:54.840 --> 04:55.800]  It's not a huge deal
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.720]  but especially with that powered adapter because then you can basically just plug your mixer into the powered adapter if it's a USB mixer and
[05:01.720 --> 05:03.800]  Then you've got you've got mics
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.560]  But if you're trying to do a remote show like if we were trying to do this show right now on the iPad
[05:09.560 --> 05:17.000]  Right what I would have to do is I'd have to have my iPad open with either with Skype or with
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.000]  Voice memos or whatever recording thing and then my iPhone
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.880]  Whatever device I wasn't using to run Skype. I'd have to plug my Apogee mic into and
[05:29.680 --> 05:33.600]  Run voice memos from there, so it's basically like you have to use two devices
[05:33.600 --> 05:40.240]  And of course your natural Skype call is gonna sound like shit because you're not actually
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.440]  Recording through the good or you're not actually talking through the good mic right like on a Mac
[05:44.440 --> 05:49.180]  You need two apps so like for example we use I use almost all the 90% of the time
[05:49.180 --> 05:55.200]  I use Skype for the connection, and then and then I use an app called call recorder, which sort of runs as a
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.600]  Extension within Skype, but you could use just about anything
[05:58.600 --> 06:02.640]  There's on any app that can record audio you could I mean lots of people just use QuickTime
[06:02.760 --> 06:08.620]  You can just open the QuickTime player app and say new audio recording pick the same microphone as the input
[06:08.840 --> 06:14.880]  And so like what you hear you know like I don't it's a little inside baseball, but for anybody out there like to me
[06:14.880 --> 06:21.620]  You sound as good to me right now as I'm talking to you as you would if I were just listening to the show after
[06:21.620 --> 06:26.460]  It's being done editing because I hear you through the same microphone that you're recording
[06:26.980 --> 06:33.860]  Whereas so it's two apps one to record one to do the connection and but if you do iOS you have to use two devices
[06:34.140 --> 06:35.420]  Yeah
[06:35.420 --> 06:37.600]  Which is just ridiculous to my guns
[06:37.600 --> 06:38.300]  I mean
[06:38.300 --> 06:40.300]  It's doable like I did it last
[06:40.300 --> 06:45.600]  Last fall when I was on vacation when the iPad Pro first came out. I did a podcast
[06:46.300 --> 06:48.420]  With with Mike Hurley and Jason Snell
[06:48.420 --> 06:54.420]  I was a guest on upgrade and so I did it that way because I literally I only had my iPad my iPhone and an
[06:54.420 --> 06:58.000]  iPad mic so there was no other way like I couldn't just be like I
[06:58.220 --> 07:01.500]  I'm gonna try and use a computer because there was no computer available to me
[07:01.500 --> 07:05.700]  so it's doable if you're in that pinch, but it's definitely not what I would call a
[07:05.700 --> 07:10.620]  A first-rate solution. It's the podcasting is not what you go to iOS for
[07:14.780 --> 07:16.780]  So
[07:17.420 --> 07:24.360]  What is your Apple does your Apple TV remote lost or not lost it is not lost at the moment, thank goodness
[07:25.220 --> 07:29.820]  It is it is sitting on my desk right now next in its studio neat stand
[07:31.140 --> 07:35.300]  You I think was it just today that this came out. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[07:35.300 --> 07:40.780]  So I saw the headline is this is serenity's article at I'm more it says wish list someday
[07:40.780 --> 07:42.780]  I would like to stop losing my Siri remote
[07:44.460 --> 07:47.640]  Yes, I this came about because I saw
[07:48.740 --> 07:51.620]  Suzy Oaks tweet a macworld story
[07:52.100 --> 07:55.320]  Of I I can't remember who wrote it. I think it was Jared Devine
[07:55.940 --> 08:02.540]  who wrote a story basically being like I've stuck a tile to the back of my Siri remote and now I can find it and
[08:02.540 --> 08:06.380]  Simultaneously, I'm like, that's really smart and oh god
[08:06.380 --> 08:12.980]  Is this what we've really come to like is is the only way that I'm going to be able to find my Siri remote
[08:13.300 --> 08:19.700]  To be able to stick a device that's pretty much half the size of the Siri remote to the back of the Siri remote
[08:19.900 --> 08:24.300]  And do it every year because the tiles only last 12 months
[08:24.940 --> 08:26.940]  yeah, the tiles being the
[08:26.940 --> 08:33.500]  Oh, yeah, it was a Kickstarter project. Yeah. Yeah, there are little Bluetooth trackers that connect to your iPhone
[08:33.820 --> 08:37.900]  So that and then because they're their Bluetooth set and then they have a tiny speaker embedded
[08:37.900 --> 08:44.500]  so it works similarly to the find iPhone button on the on the Apple watch where you just you press the button and then
[08:44.700 --> 08:50.140]  Your your wallet or your keys or whatever ring and I have tiles for my wallet my keys and they're very useful
[08:50.420 --> 08:54.060]  But I don't I wouldn't put it on the the remote is so thin
[08:54.060 --> 09:00.340]  It just looks it looks like I've just stuck a battery pack on my remote for what for for the purposes of the teensiest
[09:00.340 --> 09:06.420]  Little speaker in the world. I love it's one of my favorite Apple watch features is the ability to ping your iPhone
[09:06.420 --> 09:09.980]  I don't lose my iPhone very often or I don't misplace it or forget where it goes
[09:09.980 --> 09:13.420]  but then when you do it'll drive you crazy and be oh my gosh and
[09:13.820 --> 09:16.420]  Being able to ping it from the watch is so much better
[09:16.420 --> 09:21.800]  It's so much more convenient than logging in to find my iPhone to play the sound. It's so much more convenient
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.760]  Yeah, it's a great feature and it just sort of makes sense in the look
[09:26.360 --> 09:28.440]  It's all in the same house or same
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.200]  You know if you assume it's all in the same house and everything's already hooked up to the same network or whatever
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.240]  One of these things should be able to find the other and they can both make noise and they both are you know?
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.140]  Loosely connected at all times. So it makes sense that you'd be able to do that
[09:43.140 --> 09:45.880]  So I feel like there's got to be a solution like this for the remote
[09:45.880 --> 09:48.760]  You should be able to like say like hey Apple TV
[09:48.760 --> 09:51.960]  Where's the goddamn remote and then it will beep the remote?
[09:52.720 --> 09:55.760]  Seriously, I mean I so I kind of I said this in my article
[09:55.760 --> 09:59.880]  but I kind of understand why it wasn't a feature at launch because they I mean they were
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.120]  Rushing to get this thing out the door and the the remote app for the iPhone wasn't even ready
[10:04.200 --> 10:07.360]  So there was you know, if the remote app for the iPhone wasn't gonna be ready
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.760]  there was physically no button for them to be able to press to be like find iPhone and because the
[10:13.400 --> 10:15.400]  because the Siri speaker or the Siri
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.560]  Microphone is built into the remote not into the Apple TV
[10:19.560 --> 10:24.240]  You can't just like shout to the heavens like you might to an Amazon echo being like, where's my remote?
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.800]  Although that would be a cool feature Apple just saying but what I'm kind of hoping for is
[10:30.080 --> 10:34.000]  like the Siri remote just connects to the Apple TV via Bluetooth and
[10:34.880 --> 10:42.360]  Theoretically Apple could design a next-generation remote without having to make us buy an entirely new Apple TV
[10:42.360 --> 10:47.360]  Like they could just sign it and say this works with this Apple TV and then just insert a tiny little speaker
[10:47.360 --> 10:51.240]  It already works via Bluetooth. So it already has the connection inherent
[10:51.240 --> 10:57.120]  You know to to send a ping to the remote to say yo make a sound wherever you are
[10:57.120 --> 11:00.000]  I just don't I don't think there's a speaker in the remote right now. There's only a
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.720]  It's never used for anything if there is it's so hidden that I fix it couldn't even find it
[11:06.720 --> 11:13.000]  But I and again, I always file this under look. I know it's a lot easier for us on the outside to tell Apple
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Just put another $2
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.600]  Component into this device and that device and it's very easy to say, you know to quickly
[11:21.160 --> 11:23.000]  dissipate Apple's profit margins
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.720]  But I really do think that for the price that Apple charges for Apple for the Apple TV and for the like
[11:29.720 --> 11:34.520]  What what did the extra aren't the extra remotes like 60 bucks? Yeah, there are the extra remote. I think is $79
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.360]  Yeah, so look if it's a $79 remote you can put I'm sorry Tim Cook
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.320]  You can put it you can put a speaker in there. That doesn't have to be high fidelity
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.140]  Just has to be it just needs to be loud enough to be heard through sofa cushions
[11:48.140 --> 11:52.560]  Oh, yeah, all I need is a nice high-pitched like submarine like beep
[11:53.120 --> 11:57.500]  Like it doesn't even have to be pleasant to the ears. I just need to be able to find it
[11:57.500 --> 12:04.000]  Right and yeah, and they could sell that's the thing is like Apple tomorrow could come out with Apple TV remote
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  Now a speaker and theoretically you could just buy it and pair it to your Apple TV
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.520]  Like that's what I want them to do
[12:09.520 --> 12:10.960]  I'm like, yes
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.480]  don't don't worry about releasing it with your next generation Apple TV take take time to like upgrade that hardware, but
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.600]  Just to put a speaker and somehow an asymmetric button arrangement so that you
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.160]  So you can figure out which way is up
[12:24.400 --> 12:31.200]  You know, I do you do you have the remote strap because that's what I eventually I don't like the strap because it's always flapping around
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.240]  What I did is I took a piece of gaffers tape and wrapped it around
[12:34.920 --> 12:37.160]  The bottom. Oh, so you have the texture
[12:37.360 --> 12:37.840]  Yeah
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.760]  And it goes on the side the texture because it's a piece of tape that wraps around
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.160]  All the way around and so I can feel it from the sides and it's a lot easier
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.040]  Yeah, and it doesn't completely degrade the look of it because black gaffers tape blends in. Yeah, I like that. That's smart
[12:54.480 --> 12:57.340]  Yeah, but I still feel like it's ridiculous that I've
[12:57.340 --> 13:02.140]  I've got to jury-rig a design solution to an $80 remote control
[13:02.340 --> 13:07.740]  Well, yeah, exactly. The worst part is I'm picking I just picked up my remote and my remotes upside down right now
[13:07.740 --> 13:09.740]  This is the remote that doesn't have the strap on it
[13:09.820 --> 13:10.980]  and
[13:10.980 --> 13:16.340]  With the like all of the icons are so minimalist that even holding it upside down
[13:16.620 --> 13:19.300]  The only way that you know that you're holding it upside down
[13:19.300 --> 13:25.860]  Is that menu the only the only word on the on the thing is upside down and even when you're first looking at it
[13:25.860 --> 13:30.540]  The you and menu kind of looks like an N and then the N is still right side up
[13:30.540 --> 13:36.100]  So you read like two letters in before you're like before your brain registers. Oh, this is an word
[13:36.100 --> 13:39.860]  Maybe I should flip this around. I don't know. It's it's painful
[13:39.860 --> 13:44.160]  I find that the the longer we go with this remote the more I the more worrisome
[13:44.160 --> 13:51.500]  I consider it as an exhibit in the case against the slight decline of overall design quality coming out of Apple these days
[13:51.660 --> 13:53.980]  You know, that's a long title for the lawsuit
[13:53.980 --> 14:01.700]  but I do feel that it's a pretty good example because it's great technology and I love basic idea and I really love
[14:02.660 --> 14:03.900]  It's time goes on
[14:03.900 --> 14:09.660]  I really really like the the interface that as you use the trackpad and that the way that the
[14:09.780 --> 14:12.700]  Forget the name of it and stunt UI kit, but whatever they call it
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.280]  Yeah on the on the Apple TV, right?
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.140]  But the way that things pop up as there's to indicate what's selected I find it so intuitive really like it
[14:22.140 --> 14:26.060]  I'd like it so much as time goes on the the talk to it thing
[14:26.060 --> 14:28.420]  I know other devices, you know have this now too, but
[14:29.060 --> 14:34.420]  Like my Jonas is going through a friend's bender. He's obsessed
[14:34.420 --> 14:40.460]  He's 12 years old obsessed with the show friends on Netflix and it's so awesome because he's got it timed now
[14:40.460 --> 14:44.700]  He knows exactly when the theme song kicks in exactly how many seconds to jump ahead
[14:46.740 --> 14:48.820]  Skip ahead 30 it's 35 seconds
[14:48.820 --> 14:54.180]  He's got like a and there's like a certain point in the song like to make a line or two in where he does it
[14:54.180 --> 14:59.820]  And it and it finishes exactly with like the the final strum of the theme song
[15:00.580 --> 15:04.120]  And he's always like he likes to nail it so that he doesn't miss a single thing
[15:04.940 --> 15:10.460]  It's a great feature 35 seconds. So in other words a 30 second skip wouldn't be quite right
[15:10.460 --> 15:13.860]  You'd get five extra seconds of the song that you wouldn't want
[15:13.860 --> 15:20.460]  But I still think that the there's so many little details of it that the
[15:20.860 --> 15:27.300]  Getting those details right or though is the whole reason Apple is Apple and yeah that they didn't with this is to me a little
[15:27.700 --> 15:32.220]  Alarming, it's such a small thing to complain about the the Siri remote that comes with Apple TV
[15:32.620 --> 15:37.860]  But it's exactly the sort of little thing that to me that that there should be famous for getting right?
[15:37.860 --> 15:42.100]  Yeah, well, it's the small stuff and I mean there's been plenty of talk about how
[15:42.100 --> 15:48.860]  Despite the fact that this you know box has been in development for four years how rushed this version was out the door
[15:48.860 --> 15:54.740]  And I can't help but feel that the remote was a partial casualty of that because I see
[15:55.380 --> 16:00.860]  like I see where they wanted it to go and I see how it's a natural evolution of the
[16:01.020 --> 16:04.540]  Apple TV remote from the third generation Apple TV
[16:04.900 --> 16:09.260]  but also looking at like looking at the Apple TV and looking what it
[16:09.260 --> 16:13.780]  Was how we work with it and how it's also puts us also supposed to be a game controller
[16:14.620 --> 16:18.020]  I'm just like Apple you didn't need to make it be a stick
[16:18.180 --> 16:21.660]  Like it doesn't have to look like the third generation Apple TV
[16:21.660 --> 16:22.980]  It would have been okay
[16:22.980 --> 16:27.900]  If it was leave like a little bit fatter or a little bit wider or even a different shape
[16:28.300 --> 16:32.820]  Because it's just you know what? I don't need a remote that looks like a nano
[16:32.820 --> 16:39.620]  I need a remote that works and it's functional practically speaking there. There's a cut, you know, a definite conflict between the
[16:40.660 --> 16:42.660]  perceived aesthetic
[16:42.660 --> 16:45.420]  advantage of being symmetric and the
[16:46.460 --> 16:50.100]  Completely undeniable usability advantage of being asymmetric
[16:50.780 --> 16:56.100]  whether that's it like making it a wedge shape sort of, you know in profile like a MacBook Air or
[16:56.740 --> 17:00.700]  Making it a wedge shape like a Star Destroyer where it's more of a triangle
[17:00.700 --> 17:03.540]  I mean, there's all sorts of ways that you could make it asymmetric, right?
[17:04.660 --> 17:09.740]  Or a round type thing. I know a lot of people are big fans of TiVo remotes
[17:09.740 --> 17:13.780]  I actually find TiVo remotes to be very pleasant to hold the peanut shape
[17:13.780 --> 17:20.840]  But the fact that the peanut is symmetric actually has the same problem in my opinion that I feel like a TiVo remote would be
[17:20.840 --> 17:22.580]  better if it was only
[17:22.580 --> 17:24.980]  You know like slightly asymmetric
[17:24.980 --> 17:28.660]  Yeah, you know like a weird, you know, like when you're eating peanuts and you get like a weird one
[17:28.660 --> 17:33.740]  We're like that, you know, there's like the bottom is a little bit oversized. Yeah. Yeah
[17:34.100 --> 17:37.520]  I'm holding the Apple TV or the Siri remote in my hand right now
[17:37.520 --> 17:38.260]  and
[17:38.260 --> 17:41.100]  I'm thinking back to the like the Jeff Daniels
[17:41.140 --> 17:47.580]  Commercial about the 4-inch iPhone and like moving your your thumb from one end of the corner to the other and there's just not enough
[17:47.740 --> 17:52.060]  Like I have relatively small hands and even with relatively small hands and long fingers
[17:52.060 --> 17:59.700]  there's not enough bottom of the Siri remote to grip in order to be able to comfortably place your thumb so that you hit the
[17:59.980 --> 18:04.980]  Like minus end of the volume button and the play pause and also access comfortably the trackpad
[18:05.080 --> 18:06.460]  You're kind of like
[18:06.460 --> 18:12.380]  You're gripping it with like a finger and a half in order to be able to reach down that far and then also reach up
[18:12.380 --> 18:14.380]  like the actual the the
[18:14.820 --> 18:18.900]  Usable area between the buttons and the top of the trackpad is totally thumb reachable
[18:18.900 --> 18:25.340]  but but you can't you just can't hold it comfortably and if you're going to hold it comfortably which is like moving it up in
[18:25.340 --> 18:27.340]  Your hand so that all four fingers are
[18:27.380 --> 18:32.420]  Creaching it and like the bottom left corner of the Apple T or the Siri remote is like comfortably in your hand
[18:32.900 --> 18:38.020]  Then you really have to like go into your hand with your thumb to actually reach the bottom buttons
[18:38.260 --> 18:44.820]  So for my just from a comfortability standpoint and a this is how I am holding a remote. It's just it's awkward
[18:44.820 --> 18:46.380]  It's awkward on your thumb
[18:46.380 --> 18:49.180]  I would be remiss if I do not mention I know and
[18:49.540 --> 18:52.820]  It'll keep some email from coming because I've gotten tons of it from from readers
[18:53.180 --> 18:58.100]  Pointing out asking if I noticed and yes, I did that in the new version of the Apple TV OS
[18:58.100 --> 19:00.620]  I think it's version 2.2. Yeah
[19:01.300 --> 19:05.340]  That they've changed the behavior of the remote trackpad. So that's
[19:06.260 --> 19:07.860]  Thank God, right
[19:07.860 --> 19:13.700]  you know and the change is that the trackpad in terms of being receptive to like
[19:13.700 --> 19:17.460]  fast forwarding or skipping ahead only is
[19:17.980 --> 19:21.220]  Sensitive to that once you've clicked it to pause. Yes
[19:21.220 --> 19:27.700]  so if you're playing video and you pick up the remote and you'd pick it up upside down or the way you pick it up your
[19:28.220 --> 19:35.700]  Finger touches the trackpad. Nothing happens until you click whereas until version 2.2. It was immediately live
[19:36.340 --> 19:41.660]  Which I can see and to me it's just like it just reeks of being designed in
[19:41.660 --> 19:43.060]  an
[19:43.060 --> 19:48.020]  office with the lights on and you're looking at it and you can see it as opposed to being
[19:48.740 --> 19:53.100]  Actually, like play tested in a real living room at night with you know
[19:53.620 --> 19:56.780]  Well, you can't see the remote or you're not paying we have it
[19:56.780 --> 19:56.940]  Yeah
[19:56.940 --> 20:01.940]  You have the lights off or you have your hue lights on to movie mode or whatever and you can't see the remote but moreover
[20:02.340 --> 20:07.420]  the biggest problem to me when I first got the Apple TV remote is I'm I'm the type of person where like we have a
[20:07.420 --> 20:12.220]  That's like a deep couch. So I will usually curl up on the couch to watch something
[20:12.220 --> 20:16.340]  And then the remote will either go on the arm or it will go on the cushion next to me
[20:16.340 --> 20:19.220]  Which also that's probably why I'm losing all of these remotes
[20:19.860 --> 20:21.060]  but
[20:21.060 --> 20:26.140]  What in 9-1 the original, you know version of the Apple TV software?
[20:26.140 --> 20:33.140]  I would move and even touching the the trackpad area with like my leg or my clothing would instantly
[20:33.140 --> 20:41.100]  Start the scrub, right? And there there is a but I think it's the play pause button will like will take you out of the scrub
[20:41.100 --> 20:44.580]  Motion, but for the life of me, I could never remember which button that was
[20:45.100 --> 20:49.900]  When I before I kind of learned the interface and it's just like you're in the scrub and now you're in panic
[20:49.900 --> 20:51.480]  Right because you're like, oh god
[20:51.480 --> 20:57.260]  I've accidentally scrubbed 45 minutes ahead and I don't remember where I am and I can't touch the trackpad
[20:57.260 --> 21:04.040]  Right. And if you're watching with anybody else you immediately get the hey, yeah, what did you do? I'm sorry
[21:04.980 --> 21:06.980]  Yeah, so that that
[21:07.020 --> 21:12.780]  Improvement to 9-2 like there are a lot of really really good improvements in then in the 9.2 software update to Apple TV
[21:12.780 --> 21:14.820]  but that was probably that was the one where I
[21:15.160 --> 21:20.900]  you know got up out of my chair and like raised my hands and like thanks and gratitude because it's
[21:21.020 --> 21:26.020]  Like I would trigger it pretty much every time I watch television and now yes, it's a little bit
[21:26.020 --> 21:30.980]  You know, it's more involved and I under like I get the thinking behind it, right?
[21:30.980 --> 21:34.360]  I the development process where they say oh, yeah
[21:34.360 --> 21:34.820]  well
[21:34.820 --> 21:35.020]  no
[21:35.020 --> 21:41.220]  we we want you to just be able to swipe across it because otherwise the feature isn't discoverable or it's not easy enough and
[21:41.260 --> 21:47.220]  Too many clicks and I get the institutional thinking behind that but in usability, you know
[21:47.220 --> 21:51.700]  I don't mind making the the extra click to scrub and in fact, it's much better
[21:51.700 --> 21:55.420]  It's why you have to try stuff and you can't just think it sounds like a great idea
[21:55.420 --> 21:59.300]  It was totally worth trying it should not have shipped. No
[21:59.820 --> 22:05.100]  Usability, but it but it totally sounds like a good idea. Yeah, don't make me wait. Don't make me wait for a click
[22:05.100 --> 22:11.940]  Just start scrubbing. Oh exactly make it easy, except for the fact that your trackpads don't recognize the difference between a leg and a finger
[22:13.020 --> 22:16.940]  Or picking it up upside down. All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor
[22:16.940 --> 22:20.660]  It is our good friends at igloo. We all struggle with productivity
[22:20.660 --> 22:27.980]  We're all constantly under pressure to accomplish more do it faster and all teams small groups companies have
[22:28.300 --> 22:31.980]  Evolved their own ways to communicate to share data
[22:33.100 --> 22:39.640]  Every everybody's system is different than everybody else's let's face it. Well igloo can help you keep doing things your way
[22:40.300 --> 22:47.100]  Only better. It's the intranet that you will actually like collaboration shouldn't be painful
[22:47.100 --> 22:49.660]  It shouldn't force a whole system on your team
[22:49.660 --> 22:52.020]  And that's the way igloo is designed
[22:52.880 --> 22:55.420]  Go to igloo software comm slash
[22:56.020 --> 22:59.340]  TTS TTS being the initials of the talk show
[22:59.780 --> 23:05.440]  And you'll get a free trial right there at igloo software and you can just start using it right now
[23:05.860 --> 23:08.420]  You get a 30-day free trial for as many people as you want
[23:08.420 --> 23:11.800]  If you have a team of 10 people or fewer, you can just use it for free indefinitely
[23:12.440 --> 23:14.500]  Which is fantastic for a small enough team
[23:14.500 --> 23:19.780]  and here's the thing you can just use the parts of igloo that you need to fill in the gaps in your
[23:19.860 --> 23:22.220]  Collaboration right now and they have got so much stuff
[23:22.220 --> 23:27.860]  They've got stuff like what they call a microblog which think of it as like your own private Twitter just for your group
[23:28.540 --> 23:30.300]  fantastic little feature
[23:30.300 --> 23:32.300]  Great way to share links and stuff like that
[23:32.300 --> 23:37.060]  That might be about like competitors or something like that the type of stuff that you wouldn't want to share on public Twitter
[23:37.100 --> 23:41.500]  But you'd want to have you know be able to tweet to each other in the same way great little feature
[23:41.500 --> 23:43.840]  calendars file sharing
[23:45.080 --> 23:46.240]  things like
[23:46.240 --> 23:49.800]  Read notifications for documents that you've shared with other people on your team
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.060]  If you need that you can use it if you don't need it. You don't have to worry about it
[23:53.060 --> 23:58.240]  Don't turn it on so configurable so many options to choose from really really easy to get started
[23:58.560 --> 24:01.880]  Using it and to set it up and it's even easier to actually use
[24:02.380 --> 24:06.080]  So sign up now at igloo software comm slash TTS
[24:06.080 --> 24:08.080]  Ah
[24:09.200 --> 24:11.440]  So I mean maybe we should get right to the
[24:13.520 --> 24:16.840]  The iPad Pro this is really what I want to talk about is the new
[24:17.200 --> 24:21.560]  9.7 inch iPad Pro, which I've been using since the event and I still haven't written about
[24:23.120 --> 24:27.640]  Because I'm finding it really hard to not hard but it I
[24:27.640 --> 24:34.860]  I I detect on Twitter that this is in some ways to me looking at it objectively the
[24:35.160 --> 24:38.520]  9.7 inch iPad Pro is maybe the most
[24:42.160 --> 24:48.320]  Purist modern like it symbolizes everything that Apple is doing today overall to me. It's like right in the middle
[24:48.520 --> 24:55.040]  It's not small like an iPhone. It's not big like a Mac. It's running their most popular OS iOS 9
[24:55.040 --> 24:57.040]  It's
[24:57.440 --> 25:03.640]  A form factor that has evolved the least of anything from where it started right like the
[25:03.880 --> 25:06.560]  9.7 inch display is exactly what the original iPad had
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.240]  All they've done is make it thinner flatter and lighter over the years and then starting with the iPad airs
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.240]  They got rid of the bezels on the side
[25:16.800 --> 25:22.280]  Very very to me. It's very very similar in so many ways to the original iPad just better much
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.640]  And yet to me
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.760]  It's the one device that I see on Twitter and I can see in my email from readers that makes some people the angriest
[25:31.240 --> 25:34.520]  and I it's like to me, it's like the most innocent and like
[25:36.240 --> 25:38.240]  Non
[25:38.960 --> 25:41.280]  It shouldn't be controversial least controversial
[25:42.820 --> 25:48.200]  Computing device that Apple makes in the entire lineup and yet it seems to be the one that has makes people the angriest
[25:48.200 --> 25:55.120]  How dare you insinuate that an iPad might ever replace my beautiful wonderful Macintosh?
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.560]  How dare you that's that's the gist, right? Yeah, the gist of it is is
[26:00.080 --> 26:02.080]  outrage at the claim that
[26:02.240 --> 26:08.680]  That you can get you could do your work on it and or that anyone could do their work on it and that it therefore
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.300]  Doesn't deserve to be called Pro even though just putting the word Pro in the name seems to to rile some people up
[26:14.300 --> 26:21.780]  and I don't get it and I and I come at this from the perspective of somebody who even just earlier on the show talking to
[26:21.780 --> 26:27.100]  You about the podcast me personally. I I won't say couldn't because couldn't is too strong a word, but I
[26:27.740 --> 26:34.240]  Don't like working from an iPad of any sort compared to working on a Mac
[26:34.340 --> 26:38.380]  You don't prefer it. I do not prefer it and I often I feel
[26:38.380 --> 26:46.500]  Hamstrung, I feel like I'm I'm doing my work with chopsticks instead of with my fingers directly
[26:47.420 --> 26:51.060]  Yeah, I was right there with you until last November
[26:51.700 --> 26:56.140]  And that's and I feel like that's totally fine. Like I don't I
[26:57.020 --> 27:01.140]  folks who have been using the Mac for years and years and years who have
[27:01.660 --> 27:05.160]  Extensive workflows on the Mac and are comfortable with their Macintosh
[27:05.160 --> 27:11.440]  like I I completely understand why the initial impression to the iPad is a
[27:11.760 --> 27:14.360]  little bit of abject horror and and even like a
[27:15.080 --> 27:17.600]  I'm making like the cartoon like Oh
[27:18.480 --> 27:20.480]  evil like hands-crossed
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.400]  frightened face about about the iPad, but it's not
[27:26.400 --> 27:28.840]  It's not here to take away your Mac
[27:28.960 --> 27:34.000]  Like I really I really feel like maybe it's just a bumper sticker that comes with the iPad
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.120]  It's like this. This isn't intended to destroy the iMac or even really to destroy
[27:39.640 --> 27:42.520]  The laptop is a different type of computer
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.520]  I don't I really don't get the anger and I say that like I said as somebody who personally does not
[27:48.280 --> 27:52.620]  Really strongly does not prefer to use it for what I would consider my work
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.400]  I'd that's me personally
[27:56.400 --> 28:01.400]  I don't but I completely don't deny that other people would see advantages to it
[28:01.400 --> 28:07.040]  and I'd so I don't understand the anger at it and I you know, and I guess and I think it maybe even
[28:07.920 --> 28:12.820]  Plays into like what we were saying earlier when we were saying that with your poor
[28:13.500 --> 28:17.900]  11-inch MacBook Air they got drowned that it's not a good time to buy a Mac
[28:17.900 --> 28:21.700]  And so they like it. I love that the Mac rumors buying guide
[28:22.040 --> 28:26.520]  Which is a great service whenever anybody asks me for advice on should I get a new Mac now?
[28:26.520 --> 28:27.660]  I don't even listen to rumors
[28:27.660 --> 28:31.100]  I just say just go look at the Mac rumors buying guide and they don't even really go by rumors
[28:31.100 --> 28:37.800]  They list them I guess but for the most part it's just how many days has it been since the last time Apple revved this
[28:38.440 --> 28:45.040]  Device and what's the average in history for this device in terms of how long does Apple go?
[28:45.040 --> 28:48.040]  And if it's green, I mean tell you this is a fairly new product
[28:48.200 --> 28:48.680]  definitely
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.080]  you should feel free to buy it now because it's probably early in the product cycle and then they have like a yellow like
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.260]  And mid-range and then red means look this is overdue historically. This is overdue for a revision
[28:59.260 --> 29:04.600]  Well right now just about the entire Mac lineup is in the red everything except the iMacs
[29:04.600 --> 29:11.720]  Yeah, everything except that the iMacs that have these the the new hike, you know, hi gamut displays. Mm-hmm
[29:13.160 --> 29:15.680]  And I just think that's historical circumstance
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.960]  I just think that's just the way it's worked out with Apple's focus and with Apple and Intel's roadmap and and
[29:21.960 --> 29:29.960]  Etc. And I think well, you know, we'll see revisions to an awful lot of stuff either be before WWDC or at WWDC in June
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.940]  but I kind of feel like
[29:33.060 --> 29:35.780]  and in some kind of emotional way, it's
[29:36.740 --> 29:44.220]  It contributes to the anger that people are worried that people who are worried that that this means that they're going to either
[29:44.220 --> 29:51.620]  Make the Mac go away or just just not pay attention to the entire Mac lineup that it's proof of it
[29:51.700 --> 29:57.380]  Or make it different because it you really think about it with the exception of the 4k and the 5k iMac the last real
[29:57.380 --> 30:03.060]  New Mac we saw was the 12-inch MacBook, which also made a lot of people mad different
[30:03.740 --> 30:07.340]  Well, but sort of settle is different and similar reasons. Yeah, right because
[30:08.220 --> 30:13.420]  in terms of only having a headphone jack and one USB
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.980]  USB-C
[30:14.980 --> 30:21.900]  Port and literally not even a separate one for power. That was the only two things. Yeah plug in it is sort of the
[30:22.580 --> 30:24.580]  iOS of vacation of
[30:24.620 --> 30:30.180]  Mac hardware like I think I the way I wrote last year was that a lot of people have been worried for a long time
[30:30.180 --> 30:32.180]  that Mac OS is
[30:32.280 --> 30:37.900]  Software is going to get iOS applied too far and take away what we love about the Mac
[30:37.900 --> 30:45.540]  Operating system and what we've seen actually with the MacBook is it's really the hardware that's gotten more like iOS than the software
[30:45.980 --> 30:48.540]  Yeah, you know you there's no battery to take out anymore
[30:48.540 --> 30:53.580]  I mean I don't at this point it almost feels silly that we used to be able to take out our MacBook batteries
[30:53.580 --> 30:54.100]  Oh, yeah
[30:54.100 --> 30:59.400]  I mean and you honestly even look at other folks who have like smartphones where you can take out the battery and you're like
[30:59.400 --> 31:01.400]  What this is a thing?
[31:02.100 --> 31:03.380]  Yeah, I
[31:03.380 --> 31:08.740]  Ram that soldered onto the motherboard. Yeah, God forbid you were able to replace your own RAM. I mean, it was great
[31:08.740 --> 31:11.340]  It was you know, but they're trade-offs, but it's definitely there
[31:11.340 --> 31:15.060]  I don't see how anybody could deny that that the Mac hardware has gotten
[31:15.580 --> 31:21.000]  Very of a large injection of the design sensibility of iOS. Yeah, but it also goes back
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.100]  I mean to almost the first, you know
[31:23.100 --> 31:28.340]  The first real generation of Macs too because the Mac Plus was not exactly very tinkerable
[31:28.540 --> 31:31.700]  Right think about it like you could expand the RAM. I think that was about it
[31:31.700 --> 31:35.860]  Well, that was when they they first started using special screws that yeah
[31:37.140 --> 31:40.080]  So it's not I it's funny to me when the people are like
[31:40.080 --> 31:44.460]  Oh Apple has never done this before you used to be able to tinker with all your hardware and I'm like
[31:44.620 --> 31:48.180]  No, I think you were a PC user in the 90s. Apple has never really
[31:48.780 --> 31:50.180]  Been bits and pieces
[31:50.180 --> 31:50.860]  But yeah
[31:50.860 --> 31:57.100]  The new the new MacBook and it's funny because I did when I drown my air that was the question of like, okay
[31:57.100 --> 32:03.240]  What's my next laptop gonna be? Am I gonna go to the like the 12-inch MacBook USB C? Is that gonna happen?
[32:03.780 --> 32:08.980]  Am I gonna pray that they you know come out with a revved air which is probably never going to happen
[32:08.980 --> 32:10.980]  Am I gonna go back to a pro?
[32:11.620 --> 32:16.740]  Or am I just gonna keep on using the iPad and it's just like that's that's a big question mark for me
[32:16.860 --> 32:20.120]  Because I will always have a desktop Mac like there's no question
[32:20.120 --> 32:25.260]  I need I need a superpower machine that I can do high quality editing on that
[32:25.260 --> 32:31.300]  I can for now do podcasts on you know with a little bit less complication than trying to use two devices
[32:32.020 --> 32:37.620]  but as a laptop, I've like as I was saying I I was very skeptical of
[32:38.140 --> 32:45.380]  Doing work on an iPad because I had tried I tried in 2010. I tried in 2012. I tried in 2013
[32:45.380 --> 32:48.500]  I tried in 2014 when the iPad air 2 came out
[32:49.100 --> 32:51.380]  And when the iPad Pro finally came out
[32:51.380 --> 32:56.100]  The only reason why I spent more than three days with it was the pencil being like, oh well
[32:56.100 --> 32:57.380]  I can draw on this thing
[32:57.380 --> 33:02.940]  So I took it and nothing else on a two-week vacation and I was just kind of like, you know what?
[33:02.940 --> 33:04.940]  I'm gonna take this because I want to draw and
[33:05.460 --> 33:09.980]  I'm mostly on vacation so I don't have to worry about doing a lot of work
[33:09.980 --> 33:14.500]  But if I have to do work, I'll figure out some way to like muddle through it, right?
[33:15.220 --> 33:16.300]  and
[33:16.300 --> 33:21.940]  What I ended up discovering was in those two weeks. I ended up doing quite a bit of work because of course the
[33:22.380 --> 33:29.260]  iPad Pro had just come out and I started writing like the iPad Pro experiment series on I'm or which is just me attempting to do
[33:29.260 --> 33:30.980]  various
[33:30.980 --> 33:35.180]  various facets of my normal work on the iPad with
[33:36.140 --> 33:43.380]  Surprisingly good success with the exception of podcasts which were still like a horrible, you know hellstorm to do
[33:43.380 --> 33:51.300]  I figured out ways to do photo editing and to post my stuff and and to do all of my research and
[33:51.300 --> 33:52.940]  to write
[33:52.940 --> 33:58.820]  in a day and and to make movies to to cut movies to cut audio and
[33:59.700 --> 34:03.220]  The more I use the pro and the more I use workflow
[34:03.540 --> 34:08.000]  Which Federico Vittucci at Mac stories his guides have basically been invaluable to that
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.680]  The more I got started to get really comfortable with it right where it's like it felt a lot like the first
[34:14.040 --> 34:19.820]  The first time I ever used copy-paste shortcuts on the Mac when I was like nine and my dad was like PS
[34:19.820 --> 34:24.080]  Here's a faster way to do all of the like write the same sentence five times in a row
[34:24.680 --> 34:30.360]  But it felt like that it felt it felt like oh, I I kind of understand
[34:30.360 --> 34:35.460]  How an iPad supposed to be used as like or rather how it's supposed to be used as a professional work device
[34:35.460 --> 34:38.600]  How I how I can use it as a professional work device
[34:38.600 --> 34:45.200]  And once I got into that mindset it became a lot easier when I came back and I did have the MacBook Air
[34:45.760 --> 34:48.600]  Accessible and I did have my desktop. I was like, okay
[34:48.600 --> 34:55.120]  I can do all of this on my iPad and it has the 10-hour battery and I have cellular
[34:55.120 --> 34:59.440]  so I never have to worry about whether there's Wi-Fi if I want to upload something and I don't have to
[34:59.840 --> 35:02.960]  Deal with the the hassle of setting up personal hotspot
[35:02.960 --> 35:09.720]  Um, it just it became much more comfortable, but it was a you know, it was a two three week process
[35:09.720 --> 35:11.720]  it was it was very much a like and
[35:12.040 --> 35:17.200]  a dive in headfirst and I'm gonna be frustrated for about a week and then I'm gonna figure
[35:17.520 --> 35:22.440]  stuff out and some things I'm gonna figure out and some things are still gonna be impossible with a Mac and
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.020]  In the end it was how many things can I do comfortably without the you know?
[35:28.020 --> 35:32.320]  like you were saying at the beginning without the hassle without the feeling that you're basically trying to
[35:32.320 --> 35:36.400]  You know fit an elephant into a compacts into a compact car
[35:37.040 --> 35:43.120]  Um, I always I always like the analogy of feeling like you're going uphill on a bike versus downhill
[35:43.240 --> 35:46.980]  Yeah that when you're in the flow and you have a computer that set up the way you
[35:47.640 --> 35:53.300]  You know, whatever of whatever operating system, but if you feel like you're on a bicycle that's going downhill
[35:53.300 --> 35:59.240]  That's when you're getting you feel like you're you feel great. Yeah, you feel like you're as productive as your mind
[35:59.240 --> 36:04.160]  You're only limited by your own brain and when you're going uphill it when it feels like you're going uphill
[36:04.160 --> 36:07.000]  it just feels like this sucks my
[36:07.520 --> 36:13.240]  The system is slowing me down. Like I'm you know, fully caffeinated. I'm mid day. I feel great
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.160]  I'm on you know, I feel like I've got good ideas that I'm writing or whatever I'm doing
[36:17.160 --> 36:20.480]  but if you feel like you're frustrated by the tools it
[36:21.080 --> 36:23.080]  You know it just and it somehow
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.560]  Brings you down the sense of going uphill because you feel like I could be doing I could be doing better
[36:29.160 --> 36:33.840]  It's like when you're really sick and you have all of the great ideas in the world
[36:34.060 --> 36:39.760]  But because your body is letting you down you can't execute any of them and you're like, but I want to do this, please
[36:40.600 --> 36:44.660]  Yeah, and there and there are still definitely some tasks where I feel that way with the iPad
[36:44.660 --> 36:51.080]  But I but after spending some time forcing myself to use it and getting over the initial hump. It feels a lot better
[36:51.080 --> 36:56.480]  Um 3d touch actually was something I just wrote an article over the weekend about that
[36:56.480 --> 36:59.720]  where like you were complaining a little bit about 3d touch and
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.720]  Jason Snell was complaining a lot about 3d touch and I'm like
[37:03.720 --> 37:07.900]  I totally get where you guys are coming from because there's a lot about 3d touch
[37:07.900 --> 37:13.840]  That's unfinished and a lot of it that just doesn't click properly, but there are some features, you know
[37:13.840 --> 37:19.960]  I forced myself for instance to use like the left side deep press to get into multitasking and
[37:19.960 --> 37:21.360]  and
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.800]  Using the keyboard as like a cursor so that you could move it rather than using the old style and those two shortcuts alone
[37:28.320 --> 37:31.600]  Made 3d touch. I think I called it. I was like 3d touch is a niche
[37:31.600 --> 37:34.520]  I can't live without because with those two features
[37:34.880 --> 37:41.120]  my iPhone productivity is so much faster than it was pre iPhone 6s and
[37:41.640 --> 37:48.000]  Like even with all of the problems with 3d touch that's like those two things are like no all of the devices have to have 3d
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.440]  touch and god forbid what if the home to button disappears, maybe 3d touches are like
[37:51.960 --> 37:56.200]  Initial way into that getting us comfortable with that, but you have to use it, right?
[37:56.200 --> 38:03.800]  You have to force yourself to use the left side multitasking shortcut because we're we've been trained for what?
[38:04.440 --> 38:06.560]  six seven eight years now to
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.960]  To press the double press the home button since iOS 4 to bring up the multitasking shortcut
[38:11.960 --> 38:15.080]  And if you don't give it a like if you don't force yourself
[38:15.080 --> 38:19.960]  You're not gonna get out of your old habits and you're not gonna be able to see if the new habits are
[38:20.040 --> 38:24.820]  Potentially faster or potentially slower. Yeah, I think it it highlights the
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.440]  It's just an inherent problem in
[38:28.160 --> 38:30.160]  designing systems and
[38:30.160 --> 38:36.520]  Systems meaning like the the basic UI of a computer. Yep touch screens on the Mac to me is a perfect example
[38:36.560 --> 38:39.460]  We still don't have them and I still I don't think we ever will
[38:39.460 --> 38:46.520]  I just because it just doesn't work to have an interface where the elements are so close to each other to be so tiny
[38:46.640 --> 38:52.520]  Fine, you know and they should be because the mouse is a very fine instrument or a trackpad or you know
[38:52.520 --> 38:56.020]  Or whatever you're using for input on the Mac. It's so fine
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.400]  I
[38:58.400 --> 39:04.260]  Kind of feel like 3d touch though is that way to iOS where if we had had 3d touch right from the start in
[39:04.260 --> 39:09.700]  2007 I feel it would be integrated with the system in a way that kind of can't be now
[39:09.980 --> 39:13.180]  because they can't just make things that are essential for it because only
[39:14.380 --> 39:19.100]  The iPhone 6s and 6s plus have it even new iPads don't have it
[39:19.580 --> 39:24.540]  So every other iOS device needs to beat there needs to be a way to do the 3d touch stuff without it
[39:24.580 --> 39:25.100]  Yeah
[39:25.100 --> 39:32.120]  And I for that I look to live photos as a good example of something where this is this is something that is exclusive to the
[39:32.120 --> 39:39.400]  6s the 6s plus the small iPad Pro and the iPhone SE and only two of those four devices
[39:40.080 --> 39:40.960]  have
[39:40.960 --> 39:41.880]  3d touch
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.120]  So they just said and also they have of course live photos on the Apple TV and live photo support on the eye on the Mac
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.220]  To look at it. They're like, okay
[39:50.220 --> 39:50.440]  well
[39:50.440 --> 39:54.460]  how do we still show the like shift from still photo to live photos and
[39:54.920 --> 40:01.240]  On the on the iPad and on the iPhone says see it's just a long press and I'm I mean
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.240]  I think you mentioned that in your in your
[40:03.880 --> 40:09.920]  Sort of overview of Jason's article where it's like it makes a lot of sense to tie 3d touch to a long
[40:09.920 --> 40:13.860]  Press gestures be especially because if you've ever used a 3d touch device
[40:14.420 --> 40:17.120]  and I think about it from the home screen primarily is
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.520]  Trying to actually trigger the difference between a long press and a 3d touch and a light 3d touch is almost impossible
[40:24.600 --> 40:29.200]  You try and edit your home screen and it's just like nope. You're gonna preview an app icon. Nope
[40:29.200 --> 40:31.200]  You didn't do it that we didn't do it right either
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.600]  So I don't under I don't understand why they didn't just jump into the idea of let's just design iOS 9
[40:38.760 --> 40:41.640]  So that a long press equals 3d touch
[40:41.920 --> 40:44.880]  Can I tell you one of the other minor annoyances that I have a 3d touch?
[40:44.880 --> 40:50.680]  I love the idea of long of hard-pressing the apps on the home screen and getting shortcuts
[40:50.680 --> 40:51.520]  And so yeah
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.020]  And there's some great apples done some great stuff with that and I know that a lot of third-party
[40:56.020 --> 41:01.100]  Utility makers have some really clever stuff in there. But the one that drives me nuts is for the phone app
[41:01.660 --> 41:04.700]  It's like you can't set who the people are. It's like the no
[41:04.700 --> 41:09.740]  it's just like three random people and the logic of it doesn't make any sense to me because I
[41:10.380 --> 41:13.700]  It I would I would guess that at least
[41:14.220 --> 41:18.500]  Half of all the calls I ever make are to my wife and sometimes she's not
[41:18.700 --> 41:22.260]  listed and it doesn't see I don't know how there could be any algorithm that would
[41:22.260 --> 41:28.500]  That would guess as to who I'd want in that list that wouldn't include her based on my outgoing call history
[41:28.500 --> 41:31.820]  And yet sometimes she's not listed. Sometimes she is and sometimes she's not
[41:32.340 --> 41:38.460]  I just wish that I wish that feature would just let me pick three people like just say like top three people in my phone
[41:38.460 --> 41:43.780]  Favorites and that's it. Yeah was it's funny because clicking my clicking my phone right now
[41:43.780 --> 41:49.580]  It is the top three people in my phone favorites, but I'm also pretty sure that that's again. That's random
[41:49.580 --> 41:55.380]  I'm it's the same thing with messages to is like messages doesn't show the most recent people
[41:55.740 --> 42:01.340]  That you've texted and I'm like, why why doesn't it just show the three most recent people wouldn't that make the most sense?
[42:01.620 --> 42:07.860]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what they're doing. But it's definitely that's not what they're doing. No, and that's I mean, that's a
[42:08.580 --> 42:13.180]  Factor of Apple being weak on certain algorithmic things in the first place. We did a
[42:13.180 --> 42:20.960]  Retrospective on iOS 9 like six months in and one of the things that still irritates me is the whole promise of
[42:21.300 --> 42:25.700]  Proactive was really awesome and I was really excited about you know, oh, yeah
[42:25.700 --> 42:32.460]  It'll frequently know what apps are using at this time of day because it technically has all of that information and it's all local to
[42:32.460 --> 42:33.500]  your device
[42:33.500 --> 42:35.500]  but Siri suggestions
[42:35.780 --> 42:39.960]  Rarely really helpful on weird random occasions it is
[42:39.960 --> 42:46.240]  But more often than not it is just a couple of apps that I may have used recently
[42:46.840 --> 42:50.640]  And and let alone though the lock screen app suggestions
[42:50.640 --> 42:56.100]  I feel like I've only seen that once or twice in my life since installing iOS 9, you know where it's like
[42:56.100 --> 42:56.540]  Oh, yes
[42:56.540 --> 43:02.820]  It'll show you a swipe up and the bottom left hand corner for the most recently used app you use at like 9 in the morning
[43:02.820 --> 43:06.560]  I don't I've never seen that I'm waiting for it to show me like tweet bot
[43:06.560 --> 43:10.160]  Go read your tweets because you always do this every morning, right?
[43:12.620 --> 43:14.100]  So
[43:14.100 --> 43:21.140]  Before we go any further so you're you're when you say you're portable as a iPad Pro. You mean the 12.9 inch, right?
[43:21.140 --> 43:24.540]  I mean the 12.9. Yeah, I've got both sitting on my my desk right now
[43:24.540 --> 43:26.540]  but when I say the and
[43:26.900 --> 43:32.540]  I'm working on the review because like you I've been spending a lot of time using it rather than writing about it
[43:32.540 --> 43:36.380]  But when it comes to replacing a laptop
[43:37.780 --> 43:40.620]  Whole hog, you know not having a MacBook in the wings
[43:40.860 --> 43:46.080]  The 12.9 inch has to be the way to go for me because of split view and keyboard alone
[43:46.620 --> 43:50.540]  Hmm. All right, I disagree, but I will get back to that. Yeah, we can
[43:51.300 --> 43:54.120]  And I'm gonna take a moment here and thank our next sponsor
[43:54.120 --> 43:58.900]  It's our good friends longtime friends of the show fracture fracture is the come you guys remember them
[43:58.900 --> 44:05.300]  They print your photos directly onto glass. So you take your favorite photos that you've taken you upload them to fracture
[44:05.300 --> 44:11.580]  You pick what size you want and then they mail you a piece of glass that has your photo printed directly on it
[44:11.780 --> 44:13.780]  Colors pop like you won't believe
[44:14.060 --> 44:18.020]  And it even comes with a solid backing that's ready to mount right out of the package
[44:18.020 --> 44:22.140]  All you have to do is stick the included screw in the wall and hang it and then you're done
[44:22.260 --> 44:26.060]  So there's no you don't have to put it in a frame. It doesn't need a frame. It just is
[44:26.060 --> 44:29.820]  It almost is a frame. It's just a piece of glass that goes edge to edge
[44:30.340 --> 44:36.700]  So beautiful, it is so much it is so much the best way to get analog versions of your digital photos
[44:37.700 --> 44:42.340]  There's no comparison. It looks great. Everything's aligned. You can't there's no little piece of paper
[44:42.340 --> 44:47.680]  But you know like putting it in a traditional frame where it's like off-center and then just when you've got the frame all closed up
[44:47.860 --> 44:50.980]  You shifts a little bit and you've got to open it up and start all over again
[44:51.700 --> 44:55.200]  Forget about it. Don't do that. If you're gonna print photos get them printed at fracture
[44:55.200 --> 44:56.520]  It's the way to go
[44:56.520 --> 45:02.480]  It's a wonderful gift. It's a great way to decorate your home and they have a great just a great team
[45:02.480 --> 45:07.260]  They hand assemble and they check for quality. Everybody does it and it's a small team down there in Gainesville, Florida
[45:07.260 --> 45:09.260]  That prints every one of these things
[45:10.700 --> 45:16.000]  Can't recommend them highly enough really really great way to get your photos printed and if you need another reason to buy one
[45:16.180 --> 45:19.080]  Besides them just sponsoring the show and being a longtime friend of the show
[45:19.080 --> 45:25.500]  You can save 10% off with the offer code talk show 10 when you go to fracture me calm
[45:25.620 --> 45:29.980]  So go to fracture me calm to see what they have to offer and just remember the code talk show
[45:30.420 --> 45:36.380]  10 and you'll save 10% off your order from fracture go get some pictures printed
[45:37.540 --> 45:42.860]  All right. I like the 9.7 inch model better, but I think it's possibly related to the fact that
[45:43.740 --> 45:46.420]  That like I said, I don't really do work on the iPad
[45:46.420 --> 45:51.320]  I just use it for reading and I've always liked it for reading and I used to I mean
[45:51.320 --> 45:58.380]  This is how badly my eyes have gotten worse as of rocketing into my 40s, but like when the iPad mini first came out
[45:58.380 --> 46:01.980]  I loved it. I was like this is the iPad for me because I can hold it in one hand and
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.360]  it's
[46:04.360 --> 46:06.360]  but it's like as I
[46:06.460 --> 46:11.740]  Even in the years since that's come out which haven't been that many it the fact that it's just the same number of pixels as
[46:11.740 --> 46:14.700]  the 9.7 inch of iPad shrunken down
[46:14.700 --> 46:20.980]  It's a lot easier for me now to use a 9.7 inch just because it's the same interface bigger. Oh, yeah
[46:20.980 --> 46:27.820]  Oh, yeah, so if I were younger, I think I would still be a fan of the iPad mini form factor
[46:28.340 --> 46:30.340]  Now that I'm getting older. I like the
[46:30.420 --> 46:37.000]  9.7 and to me the 12 it just isn't suitable and I've gone back now that I have both of them as you know
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.840]  Called the iPad Pro here in the house. I've gone back to it and it's I see why other people like it
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.180]  I can see why people like it, especially if they're using it on a desk
[46:45.180 --> 46:51.800]  But for me, it's it's not as good a size and I find much like Jason snow who wrote a review of that smart keyboard
[46:52.700 --> 46:53.900]  I
[46:53.900 --> 46:59.740]  Expected to really despise the keyboard because of the size, but I've actually found myself. I'm pretty good typing on it
[46:59.740 --> 47:02.600]  It's it's about as I mean, it's not as good as a full-size keyboard
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.880]  I mean, I can't say that but it's way better than I expected. Yeah, it's it's serviceable
[47:07.880 --> 47:15.000]  um, which is a lot better than I can say for many many many other keyboards and I've used Bluetooth keyboards and
[47:15.700 --> 47:22.920]  USB keyboards for both the iPad mini which used to be my my go-to iPad actually and the 9.7 inch iPad
[47:23.900 --> 47:28.820]  old old original iPad and an iPad air and iPad 2
[47:30.500 --> 47:37.700]  It's interesting to me because I think there is a very big divide where the the 12.9 inch is not the device
[47:37.700 --> 47:40.060]  for people who want to read or people who want to like
[47:40.740 --> 47:42.260]  casually draw
[47:42.260 --> 47:44.740]  or just have an iPad like I
[47:45.020 --> 47:51.940]  Really think especially with the 9.7 coming in and having the smart connector and having access to the pencil the 9.7
[47:51.940 --> 47:54.100]  I mean, it's the sweet spot for iPad size, right?
[47:54.100 --> 47:59.980]  It's the iPad size that they have been developing since 2010 and it feels it feels great in the hands
[47:59.980 --> 48:05.800]  Like I thought that I was gonna get the 9.7 to look at it and to review it and then I was gonna return it
[48:05.800 --> 48:09.520]  Uh, because I was just like it's you know, I've got a I've got a big iPad
[48:09.520 --> 48:14.300]  I don't need another iPad even though it's pretty I have it in rose gold. It's nice, but I don't need it
[48:14.720 --> 48:16.800]  And I think I might keep it around
[48:17.660 --> 48:19.660]  Because it is as you said it is
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.560]  Really nice for reading and it's so light in comparison like my 12.9 inch iPad
[48:25.560 --> 48:31.440]  Here's my confession about this. Is that basically my 12.9 inch iPad is a
[48:31.440 --> 48:38.320]  Mac book with a touchscreen what I've turned it into I have it encased in like this gigantic Logitech create keyboard
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.920]  Case which turns it into like a three-pound computer, which is heavier than my MacBook Air
[48:44.520 --> 48:50.160]  And on that side, I'm I feel silly because I'm like I've just turned this incredibly
[48:50.160 --> 48:56.960]  You know fairly still fairly light piece of technology and I've basically shoved it in like one of the ugliest iPad cases
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.720]  I've ever seen in my life. Although it is bright red. So at least I've got that going for me
[49:00.720 --> 49:02.720]  but overall it's not
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.240]  It's it's not it doesn't look like an iPad
[49:07.240 --> 49:08.840]  It looks closer to a surface
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.600]  when you if you'd see it from behind than it does from an iPad and you'd only be able to tell that it's an iPad if
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.720]  You came back like behind me and looked closely at the way that it was designed because it has the home button
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.680]  But I've basically the the 12.9 inch does not come out of this case. I I will
[49:25.280 --> 49:29.880]  Occasionally take it out if I'm like showing it to somebody and they want to like feel how heavy it is
[49:29.880 --> 49:36.520]  but to me it is like it is part of this keyboard and that's part partially because the Logitech create keyboard is
[49:37.400 --> 49:43.800]  It's it has a beautiful home row that has shortcuts that just make using iOS like a desktop
[49:44.440 --> 49:45.920]  Where you can have you know?
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.200]  It has a quick to home button and it has a search button which will automatically close the app
[49:50.200 --> 49:57.260]  You're in and pull up spotlight. You can do command tab on it. So it's it's basically a laptop. It is a laptop with with
[49:57.260 --> 50:00.560]  with a multi touch on it and
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.320]  And split view and split view on the 12.9 when you're doing when you're trying to do actual work is really nice
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.200]  It's basically two portrait iPads side by side
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.260]  It's not again not the perfect implementation of multiple windows
[50:15.260 --> 50:20.720]  but I actually like I almost like it a little bit better than the tiered window system that OS X has for
[50:21.120 --> 50:24.080]  Especially for writing because it's a lot calmer, right?
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.000]  I look at my any of my Macs at any given time including the one on my Mac
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.520]  I'm staring at right now and it's there's a there's
[50:32.640 --> 50:38.600]  Sense to it. I'm not lost but it's it. I'm also displeased by the clutter that yes
[50:39.120 --> 50:46.000]  It is it's there's a method to my madness and I know which apps tend to be on which sides and and stuff like that
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.820]  But it doesn't look nice and neat. Whereas the iPad
[50:48.820 --> 50:54.540]  Enforces neatness because it's you know, you can only have two limitations time
[50:54.540 --> 50:57.680]  yeah, and they're always open at these set, you know, like
[50:59.140 --> 51:01.140]  5050 or two-thirds
[51:03.620 --> 51:10.860]  And there's a certain clarity, you know that that is very appealing to me the fact that you cannot make it messy and that you know
[51:10.860 --> 51:13.500]  And again, I think you're right and I don't think it's any
[51:13.500 --> 51:20.760]  Surprised that one group of people who find the iPad the most appealing as a true work machine
[51:20.760 --> 51:25.620]  Our writers is that it you know, because the lack of clutter can help focus your mind
[51:27.060 --> 51:32.020]  So no doubt I see the appeal of that but it's still I don't know there is something there
[51:32.020 --> 51:36.980]  It gets back to like my complaint about 3d touch not being integrated because it wasn't there from the beginning
[51:36.980 --> 51:40.960]  I find that the multitasking in iOS still isn't quite
[51:40.960 --> 51:47.220]  it's not quite seamless because it wasn't there from the beginning and the fact that every app doesn't support it and it's
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.500]  Impossible to predict which apps are going to or not and finding the apps in that right picker
[51:52.500 --> 51:58.080]  I don't think I've ever used that picker. Honestly, I opened it once and I was just like no then well, then how how do you?
[51:58.080 --> 52:05.880]  Do multitasking if you don't use the command tab, so I I always have my my iPad connected to that create keyboard
[52:05.880 --> 52:11.920]  so the all the ways that I switch is just constant command tab command cab command tab and I'll open one app and then I'll
[52:11.920 --> 52:17.140]  Split-screen it and then I'll just command tab until I find the right the right apps for it to put in the other
[52:18.200 --> 52:20.600]  Exactly exactly and it's still you know, it's not
[52:21.320 --> 52:26.880]  Perfect because there as you said it's it's something that was essentially developed what last year
[52:26.880 --> 52:30.600]  um, and it's missing things like drag-and-drop which would be
[52:31.240 --> 52:34.680]  Crucial between one pain to the other pain and which it just does not have
[52:34.680 --> 52:42.320]  For sandbox reasons and probably just development reasons and there's a I made a whole laundry list of you know
[52:42.360 --> 52:49.760]  potential features that the that the next generation of iOS for for iPad is currently lacking that people who are using it for
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.480]  professional uses
[52:51.480 --> 52:53.480]  desperately want
[52:53.480 --> 52:57.400]  But but that's you know, if you want to use the iPad as a professional machine
[52:57.960 --> 53:00.700]  You basically have to attach a keyboard to it right now
[53:00.700 --> 53:07.780]  And you can use you know, it's it's nice. The touchscreen is nice because then you can turn it into something else
[53:07.980 --> 53:13.300]  like what I really liked about the 12-inch 12.9 inches that I can take it with the keyboard and I can write up a
[53:13.300 --> 53:17.820]  Storm and I can do professional work and then just as easily I collapse it
[53:17.820 --> 53:22.260]  you know on top of the keyboard and it's just a screen and I can use that in the pencil and
[53:22.700 --> 53:25.420]  Very quickly like edit dust out of photos
[53:26.180 --> 53:29.460]  for for like I'm more hero shots or you know, I went on a
[53:29.460 --> 53:30.580]  I
[53:30.580 --> 53:35.500]  Helped some friends take some engagement photos and I was using one of the adapters
[53:35.500 --> 53:41.820]  I just pulled out the SD card and I all I uploaded them all on to my my iPad and we were able to basically go
[53:41.820 --> 53:45.820]  Through them on that 12.9 inch screen with like with a couple behind me
[53:46.020 --> 53:52.900]  Immediately pick out the favorites and then send all of those to Lightroom so that I could you know properly batch and color correct them
[53:52.900 --> 54:00.340]  And that took, you know, probably 15 minutes where on a on a Mac it probably like it's not it's not that the workflow would have
[54:00.340 --> 54:06.260]  Been it's like dramatically more difficult, but it's just it's it's taking out some of the steps
[54:06.780 --> 54:08.340]  And it's a little bit easier
[54:08.340 --> 54:08.940]  You know
[54:08.940 --> 54:14.260]  It's easier to view an iPad and pass it between people than it is to like pick up a laptop and hand it
[54:14.420 --> 54:19.020]  it's just it's it's slightly slightly different use cases and
[54:19.020 --> 54:22.380]  And again, it's not that one is better than the other
[54:22.900 --> 54:27.740]  Like overall, I think they're both great machines, especially when you talk about portability
[54:28.260 --> 54:33.740]  But if you're doing certain certain tasks and especially if you're variating tasks, you know
[54:33.740 --> 54:40.920]  You don't just use your laptop for writing you want to edit photos or you want to draw that's when the you know
[54:40.920 --> 54:49.380]  The flexibility of having an iPad with the keyboard that also just turns into an iPad when you need it is really something special. Mm-hmm
[54:49.980 --> 54:51.980]  I
[54:51.980 --> 54:58.700]  I find that the like one of the things that slows me down the most and there's just I don't know if there's if it's
[54:58.700 --> 55:06.340]  Ever gonna be good enough is the ability to precisely select ranges of text like and I don't know. Maybe it's I
[55:06.340 --> 55:09.820]  I I because I do so much of it
[55:09.820 --> 55:10.180]  it's
[55:10.180 --> 55:16.900]  It's and I've done it for years like I'm really really really fast on a Mac at taking my mouse or a trackpad if I'm
[55:16.900 --> 55:18.700]  on a MacBook and
[55:18.700 --> 55:24.220]  Selecting exactly the range of text that I want copying command tabbing to the other app and pasting it where I want it to go
[55:24.220 --> 55:30.500]  And I find that like that to me is one of those things that always feels like I'm pedaling uphill on an iPad
[55:31.380 --> 55:33.220]  It's awful. Yeah
[55:33.220 --> 55:39.300]  It's definitely better with a keyboard all of the the keyboard, you know text selection shortcuts work
[55:39.300 --> 55:40.740]  So I basically just you know
[55:40.740 --> 55:46.780]  I'll do like command control and use the arrow keys and command shift and just you know select everything I need that way
[55:47.340 --> 55:49.080]  And that and like command C
[55:49.080 --> 55:54.600]  Like all of the all of the shortcuts that I normally and I've pretty much moved entirely away from mouse based
[55:54.820 --> 56:00.620]  Text selection once I once I figured out the right like set of keyboard commands to use
[56:00.620 --> 56:05.500]  the only place where this bites me in the ass in in iOS and it's one of the things that
[56:05.660 --> 56:08.740]  You mentioned it earlier where like some apps don't support split view
[56:08.740 --> 56:13.820]  Well, some apps don't support, you know simple things like keyboard shortcuts
[56:13.820 --> 56:18.160]  Yeah, um, and I'm not calling out anybody here Google. Um
[56:18.980 --> 56:20.980]  have have basically a
[56:21.260 --> 56:26.880]  hate hate affair with the iPad right now where things like for instance in Google Docs an
[56:26.880 --> 56:34.520]  M dash doesn't work you try and do the keyboard command for an M dash and it just won't it just doesn't exist and
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.400]  And it's just like things like that or being able to select text just doesn't exist
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.440]  How I mean, how do you even break something like that? Maybe they have like a command tied to it
[56:44.440 --> 56:50.940]  I remember when the first version of text mate came out and as a longtime BB edit user the appeal of it escaped me
[56:50.940 --> 56:56.360]  But I also kept an open mind and I thought well I can see why people don't like BB edit even though I love it
[56:56.360 --> 57:02.160]  And therefore if they don't like BB at maybe this is the glass of ice water and hell that they've been waiting for
[57:02.480 --> 57:07.880]  But there were so many weird things in the first version of text mate including the fact that there was a menu command
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.440]  That was tied to just option P
[57:11.920 --> 57:17.140]  Just like it was some kind of like print setup or I don't know but some command in the app
[57:17.360 --> 57:21.480]  You had to type option P and I thought well wait how that how in the world?
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.280]  Instantly as a longtime Mac user I thought well
[57:24.280 --> 57:27.440]  How would you type the pie character and the answer was now you can't?
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.220]  And it just was that like the guy who made the app didn't know that you know
[57:33.220 --> 57:37.560]  Did you that option plus a character who's not for menu commands?
[57:37.560 --> 57:44.820]  It was really reserved for typing extended characters because he was relatively new to the Mac. It would just didn't occur to him
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.560]  Like you should never not be able to type in em to know
[57:49.560 --> 57:54.880]  And it makes you feel it makes you feel stupid and then it makes you
[57:55.440 --> 57:59.840]  Question is the keyboard broken and finally you get to the point where you're like oh
[58:00.520 --> 58:06.880]  Google just didn't build a good fucking app. You know what I'm wearing cuz I'm very angry about this. I'll give an example
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.240]  Here's an example on the iPad Pro of an app that I love I would I and I you know
[58:11.240 --> 58:14.540]  There's a rant in me holding it up. I love tweet bot for iOS
[58:14.540 --> 58:18.360]  I consider tweet bot for iOS to be my favorite iOS app
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.800]  period like by Apple or from anybody else
[58:24.560 --> 58:32.160]  But that's primarily based on my interaction with it on the phone and I find that their iPad version is not it's good
[58:32.160 --> 58:37.580]  It still is the it's the iPad Twitter app that I use but I there's little things about it that I don't like as much
[58:38.920 --> 58:41.280]  The embeds are so big. That's my problem
[58:41.280 --> 58:47.640]  Well my entire screen my thing is that I don't know what to do with that right hand column when you have it in portrait
[58:47.640 --> 58:49.080]  or not
[58:49.080 --> 58:55.100]  Landscape and I have it and and using the iPad in the keyboard. It has to be in landscape
[58:56.320 --> 59:01.720]  But the other little thing that they don't do and again, you know, I'm complaining about an app that I love
[59:02.160 --> 59:05.200]  But it doesn't it's not hooked up to the spacebar in any way
[59:06.000 --> 59:11.160]  In terms of like just scroll down. So you can't yeah, you can't just you have to put your finger on the screen
[59:11.160 --> 59:18.920]  which sort of defeats the the comfort of using the iPad in a laptop configuration with the with a any keyboard in
[59:20.760 --> 59:27.080]  One of my complaints with the iPad pro 12 inch or in 12.9 inch back in September was that using this
[59:27.480 --> 59:33.040]  Spacebar to scroll was messed up in so many apps like Safari scrolled by very strange
[59:33.840 --> 59:38.520]  Page in a quarter. Yeah, I would skip like two paragraphs every time you try this
[59:38.520 --> 59:45.160]  Yeah, so like and scrolling too much is way worse than scrolling too little because at least if it's scrolling too little you could you just
[59:45.160 --> 59:50.520]  Have to hit space too many times where if it scrolls more than a screen you've actually missed text and it defeats the purpose
[59:51.720 --> 59:57.320]  Apple commendably has actually done a lot of work and one of my biggest things that I would sing the praises of
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.120]  Using the iPad Pro and that this applies to both iPad pros at this point, but it's because it's an iOS
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.720]  9.3 thing but the spacebar
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.320]  Does what I mean in way more cases including especially in Safari?
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:15.920]  so you open up Safari and even if you're at a weird scaling factor because it's not like an iPad optimized thing you hit space and
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.040]  It scrolls by a sensible amount
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.840]  Almost almost every time I can't remember, you know in the week weeks
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.320]  I've been using this like I can only remember a handful of cases where it didn't work
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.280]  Another thing they do that's great is and I think it's new 99% sure
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.100]  It's new is that when you're using mail the up and down arrows always go to the next and previous message
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.380]  So you can do I find myself able to like
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:45.000]  Triage my inbox and just go through all of my unread emails from the day on the iPad with the keyboard
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.360]  Way way better than I could before iOS 9.3
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.000]  Simply for the fact that I can just use the up and down arrows to go between messages
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.840]  Yeah, you can use the delete key to get rid of them. So it's really nice big big improvement
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.560]  But the fact that tweetbot doesn't really do anything with the keyboard really kind of not
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.760]  I'm not gonna say it's useless because that's that's hyperbole
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.040]  But if I want to do Twitter on the iPad Pro, I I find that I need to take it off the keyboard
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.300]  Yeah, I usually I almost never run tweetbot full screen
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.000]  I'll usually run it in like 70 30 where it's the 30 little bit and then I'll have my
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.720]  My thumb and like the bottom right corner of wherever the the iPad is like propped up
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:32.040]  So I'll just scroll really little bit that but it's it's a it's a problem and for me for something like tweetbot
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.360]  I read it bottom-up. Like I won't read from like most recent
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.940]  I still am sort of a timeline completionist because I apparently hate myself
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.540]  So it's like I need a river I just need arrow keys like the spacebar would be bad for me
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.760]  But but there are apps like that
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.400]  There are apps where it's half finished and and that's I think key to a lot of folks
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.040]  I pad as a work machine complaints and
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.440]  honestly was my complaint until very recently when I went like when the pencil came out my
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.600]  my perception of pro of iPad had to change because
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:12.240]  The pencil is basically what I'd been asking for since 2010 as like this is an amazing drawing device
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.760]  And even if it sucks at everything else, I am going to carry it around because it's an amazing drawing device
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.880]  So if I have to carry it around and at this time the twelve point nine inch was the only model if I have to
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.020]  Carry it around. Well, I might it let I might as well at least figure out what else I can do with it
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:28.640]  and
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.320]  Turns out I can do quite a lot
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.420]  But when I was coming to the iPad in pre in prior versions like even the iPad air 2
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:41.760]  I was so excited about it for about a week and then it went into like my bookshelf of iOS
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.880]  Devices and then I never touched it because I just I hadn't found
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.920]  Found anything that the iPad was really good for
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.660]  Where it's like it's it's great for reading
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.360]  But because I had at the time, you know, I had I had switched to an iPhone
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:03.800]  6-plus just to try it and this have since gone back to the 6s
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.000]  but with a with a screen that big I
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.640]  I was so lazy about getting off the iPhone and reading on a device that was better for me
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.860]  Despite the fact that the the iPad has a much a much nicer screen
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:24.760]  and is much more comfortable honestly in the hand to read than trying to like prop up the iPhone with your pinky because it's just
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.480]  Small enough that you think that you can balance it like that while you read. I was just I was being lazy about it
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.960]  I was I was blowing off the iPad for that and just because when I would try and do something professionally
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:43.760]  Like when I try and prep an article with earlier versions of iOS and get to the point where I couldn't upload
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.700]  Thumbnails like I couldn't I couldn't upload a video or a photo because the upload file button in Safari didn't work
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.920]  I would just throw up my hands and be like, well, you know F this this is stupid
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.360]  This is this is not worth my time again
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.360]  It feels like you're using chopsticks instead of your fingers exactly
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.280]  Except sometimes when it's something like you that you can't even get to the file upload thing from Safari
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.120]  it's like
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.920]  Like using a Lego robot to control chopsticks from across the room
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.120]  Yeah, and it's like, you know, I'm just it'd be easier for me to just go upstairs to my Mac
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.920]  it would actually be easier to get up from where I am and
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:23.840]  To not be lazy or even if you're not home like to just it would be easier for me to go home
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.160]  And get on a Mac and do this
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:26.680]  Yeah
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.960]  and and since then
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:34.440]  You know iOS 9 has a has a file picker built in and iCloud Drive and workflow both make it so much easier to deal
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.280]  With files on on iOS then, you know
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.600]  It actually it feels like a normal file system if when you when you set it up to your liking which is really nice
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.680]  but but I feel like so many people have had those bad experiences where they go in and they try and do something on iOS and
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:56.760]  It just does not work full stop that they've given up or they or they see something not work and they're just like well
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:01.880]  That's never gonna get fixed. And why would I even try I don't even like the iPad that much
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:08.000]  so I get I get the hesitation and I and that's honestly why I'm really
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:14.080]  Excited for the 9.7 inch iPad Pro, you know as somebody I'm going to use the 12.9
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:21.680]  at least until I get a MacBook I knew a new Mac laptop if I get a new Mac laptop because it's it's comfortable and it
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.220]  Mostly does what I need like 90% of my job
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.200]  I can do on an iPad Pro and I can do it in such a way that it doesn't make me feel like I'm tearing
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.680]  My hair out where it's actually enjoyable and in some cases better than on my Mac
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:42.240]  But for the vast majority of people they're either not gonna have the time to give that a try or they're just not going to
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.080]  Be interested in giving that a try and the 9.7 inch both in cost and form factor
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.640]  I think is a lot easier sell of a here's a way to get into iPad and to mess around with iPad
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.360]  without having to make the commitment of this is going to be your only device and you're gonna carry around or you're gonna carry around
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:02.360]  A three pound iPad and keyboard along with a Mac
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.620]  The the iPad Pro the baby at the baby Pro as I've been calling it
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:13.160]  With one of like Apple's smart keyboards and and like a back cover
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.800]  Doesn't weigh that what it weighs like two two point three
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.880]  maybe if that
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.000]  I've got my hand right now with yeah with the keyboard cover on and I don't know what it weighs
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.840]  But it it it if you think of it just as an iPad it feels like this is a very heavy cover. Yeah
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.400]  And if I could take the cover off and just hold the iPad, it's like wow that cover really weighs it down
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.760]  But if I think of it as as a portable computer, you could take around that
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:42.920]  I remember what it used to be like to tell ya, you know, even the earlier errors, you know, it's like wow
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:49.900]  This is absolutely amazing in comparison. Yeah, it's it's it's like you're I was holding the 9.7 inch outside
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:56.120]  Because I was trying out the two-tone display drawing outside and we had a pretty gusty day
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.380]  And the thing almost blew out of my hands because it's just it's so light and because it's flat like that
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:06.460]  You get it the wrong way. Um, it's a really nice, you know, it's a nice shape to hold
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.020]  It feels really great and you pair it with the pencil like the thing
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:17.360]  I'm really I'm most excited about is getting this into the hands of like kids and teenagers who are interested in drawing
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:25.120]  Who are interested in you know doing more unconventional things with a computer than you might do traditionally with a Mac?
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.440]  There's an there like I've been testing drawing apps. I've been testing handwriting apps and things like that
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:36.700]  Um, there's an app that allows you to make your your own fonts. Oh, I saw your article about this
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.400]  This is this was like blew my mind
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.200]  Because I you know
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.120]  I I used to date somebody who was a who was a professional typographer and like built fonts
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.120]  and I would watch him for like
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:55.160]  Hours and hours while he would like perfect kerning and and change drawing paths and with the pencil
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:01.160]  Not only is it really easy to just sketch out like your your initial set of characters in this app
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.520]  But it has all of the all of the kerning features and all of the path
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.240]  You know adjustments that the professional version of like fontographer would have
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.800]  And it and you can upload it directly to the system with a profile so you can literally
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.800]  You know make make your own font and then install it immediately on iOS and use it in a project like pages
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:28.560]  Which is just it's like that kind of very specific niche thing
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.560]  I feel like is going to make
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.880]  Typographers sing for joy because you can you can start this and then you could bring it somewhere else, right?
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:42.120]  You could work you could start a font you have a stroke of an inspiration and you can start a font on your on your iPad
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.240]  Whether it's at nine point seven or a twelve point nine and then bring it to your Mac and work on it more
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.000]  It just I see so many
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.880]  So many kids like if I had had a device like this as a kid
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:02.520]  like my Wacom is probably the best the the most comparable thing and even that was so so like light years behind what this is
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:10.440]  that it's it's it's so much potential and the the price and the size and the fact that it works with the pencil just I
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.720]  feel like
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:19.240]  Poises the potential for for huge huge growth in that sector assuming that people will buy into it
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.480]  I'm wondering
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.360]  Because one thing about it is that if you get the whole rig with meaning, let's say the the mid mid capacity one
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:34.720]  Mm-hmm 749 and then you want the cellular it goes up to I think that's eight eight forty nine an extra
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.040]  129 one six one
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.520]  So it's an extra hundred at least a hundred bucks 120 bucks the keyboards 150 bucks and the pencils 100 bucks
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.480]  So overall you're looking at even just for the 128 one. You're looking at at least like $1,100
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:58.200]  Yes, and it's a it's pretty expensive if you want to try and outfit it now, there's all sorts of those things that aren't necessarily
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.200]  Required you don't have to get the cellular one
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:09.200]  You don't know you could get you know, thankfully the mid the the entry level is 32 gigs. Not 16 gigs and and
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.480]  decently priced right I think if you
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.600]  Know that you're never going to draw you could I think most I I think you can skip the pencil
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.600]  I think if you you know
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.720]  There might be some handwriting type things that you could do with it
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.560]  But I think as a general rule if you know
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:30.400]  You don't draw then I think it's easy to know not to get the pencil or if you're not planning
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.100]  The other thing that I think the pencil does really well is precision editing
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:40.400]  so if you're if you're a photographer or if you're anybody who's doing any kind of film work or
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.560]  Editing work audio work. This is can be really really hit
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.440]  It's like it's imagine the most precise mouse that you can
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.840]  And that's really cool. But yes, if you don't if you're not doing those things then absolutely. Yeah, and my you know
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.760]  Very small sample survey of asking my wife, you know, who is it? Very she loves her iPad
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.280]  Her iPad is her portable computer. She has an iPad air
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:10.580]  One, I guess so she's due for an upgrade. I mean she uses it. I mean just hours every day
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.920]  And so, you know, this is perfect for her the 9.7
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.320]  I was like, do you think do you want the keyboard and she's like no way because she's still
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.700]  You know, she'll peck out text messages on the on-screen keyboard, but she doesn't want a heavier cover. She wants the light cover
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.640]  And she still used to use her Mac for if she really has like a long email to write
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.980]  She's goes to her Mac. Sure. And do you want the pencil and she's like, what would I use it for?
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:37.000]  I was like, I don't know. She goes like no, I don't want a pencil. So that was it
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.480]  So it's you know, I think and it but I like that it's just a sensible like
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.980]  Do you get or not get that you don't need to spend the extra 250 bucks on the keyboard and the pencil if you're not
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.980]  Gonna use them and the answer is yes
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:56.580]  But still that's a pretty, you know, it's not like you're saving money by getting an iPad Pro instead of a MacBook
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:02.820]  I mean, yeah, maybe you compared to a MacBook Pro, but you know, you're still talking about a thousand dollar a thousand dollar plus setup
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:10.360]  Which in the grand scheme of the industry is not that cheap. No, it's not it just depends on what you're using it for, right?
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.960]  Because if it if you don't if you don't have the intention of ever using the pencil
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:22.080]  I feel like for 99% of people a Mac's probably going to be better
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:28.620]  But if you need touchscreen accessibility or if you have any desire to work with the pencil
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.300]  The iPad instantly becomes a really really exciting piece of technology, especially good
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.800]  Well, I want to tell you my favorite before I forget I want to I want to get this out
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:45.360]  There's my favorite iPad pencil hack is take the cap and put it either throw it away or just put it somewhere
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.040]  But there you're never going to use it again and don't ever use the cap and instead
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.360]  Use the little lightning adapter as the cap and I keep the little lightning adapter on the pencil at all times
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.280]  And that means that you can charge the pencil at any time
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:05.420]  Either way, you can either charge it as a male or as a female at any time and fun
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:13.300]  it and I don't understand why it wasn't like this why they're not encouraging that like the cap doesn't do any purpose other than to
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.940]  cover the protect the lightning port right and
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.200]  Instead they give you the little they give you this little adapter that you can use either way
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.860]  That's it. That's a good hack. I like that
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.460]  You know, although to be honest
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:33.180]  I have never charged my pencil with anything but the iPad in that way like wacky configuration, right? Just never
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:39.860]  Because it charges so fast with the iPad that I never even think like if I bring my pencil somewhere and it's like 5%
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:46.540]  Battery, but early five minutes gets you 20 25 percent charge, which is kind of crazy to me
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.920]  Well, you can charge it the other way and it's if you have an iPhone charge
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:56.480]  But then you have to find the wall, right and it's like though the beauty of the iPad set up to me
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.260]  Is that as long as my iPads charged when I leave the house, I don't have to bring connectors
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:07.980]  Do you have to worry about it or do you just keep the keep the lightning port exposed? I have the cap on
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.440]  the
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:14.940]  Someone on Twitter and I can't remember who it is now gave me the amazing tip where the cap is magnetic
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:20.460]  So it'll grab on to the to the smart magnets the smart cover magnets on your iPad
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.980]  So when you take the cap off to plug in your to plug in the pencil to the iPad
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.240]  You just drop it on the iPad and it's actually really it's a fun game
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.500]  You can just drop it anywhere on the iPad and it'll go and grab on one of the smart cover magnets
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.780]  So that's my that's my and my my other iPad good iPad pencil hack is
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:45.400]  buy a $2 micron pen and then steal the clip off the micron pan and then you can just slide it over the
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.900]  The silver pencil so I have a nice little clip there
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:54.360]  Keeps it from rolling to mm-hmm. $2 micron. I'm gonna write this down
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:01.280]  So that's the micron pens have like a clip. That is the right sort of exactly the right size. Yep, right
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.480]  What would you call that the right sir the right diameter? Yeah diameter circumference one of those six one. Well, six one half of those
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.920]  Yeah, exactly
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.920]  six of one pie
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:17.760]  Yeah option option P there we go pie we have a theme for this episode. Yeah
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:24.600]  So the other what else is there to talk about with the the iPad Pro there's the display
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.280]  This is the fan
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:32.040]  I know Jason and I talked about it last week and everybody's you can't not talk about it that now there is a weird like
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.640]  off-cycle
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.240]  pace to the iPad pros where
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.320]  Even though this one is six months after the twelve point nine inch one. It has some
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.260]  Technology that is clearly like an entire generation ahead
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.200]  Specifically with the display with the fact that it has the true tone feature for changing the color
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.600]  Temperature of what's on screen based on the ambient color of wherever it is that you're using it and this new
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.960]  I think I'm gonna misspeak but more or less that it has a high it displays a higher gamut
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.840]  Significantly higher gamut of colors. What is it? PC 3?
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:13.480]  Yeah, the same it's the same color gamut is on the 4k and 5k IMAX, which is pretty neat it which is extremely neat and I think
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.980]  All of this is going to come everywhere eventually
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:23.180]  Oh, yeah within I'm gonna say like three years two three years every Mac every iPhone every iPad will have
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.480]  The high gamut and the true tone
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:30.480]  Because it's just it both of them are just remarkably. It's mind-blowing
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.440]  You know, I see
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.680]  I don't know if you've ever get this John because you run your own site and you're not really beholden to publishing schedules
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.880]  But I'll occasionally do this thing on iMoreWorld
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:46.280]  I'll write a really good story and I get so excited about like I was originally planned for say after the weekend or it's planned
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.640]  To like go live on Wednesday and I'm just like I'm just gonna publish it now. I don't care if it's 11 p.m
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.760]  At night, I'm just gonna just gonna go with it now and that's kind of what I feel like true tone is on this on
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:00.700]  This iPad is is Apple being like we developed it and it's ready and we could wait until the iPhone 7
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.700]  But you know what? This will allow us to
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.880]  to get some bugs ironed out while we figure out how it works on the bigger screen and then we can bring it to the
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.760]  Smaller screen and then we can bring it to the Mac and it'll be great. Let's just launch it now guys, right?
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.280]  Exciting right, even if the fact is that it really makes for a very
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:25.560]  Ultimately, I think that the two iPad pros will be it'll be like choosing between MacBook pros where really the main thing is the duh
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:31.080]  Which size do you want? Yeah, it's a screen and maybe it may be a little bit more RAM and you know
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.520]  Like in the ways that are the hood stuff right in the ways that like a 15-inch MacBook Pro
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.280]  outperforms the 13-inch ones by a
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:46.660]  Small degree but like what you would you know, it just seems intuitively. Well, yeah, of course, it's a little a little bit better technically
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:53.320]  But it's not like that at all with that with the two iPad pros today. It's the the display quality
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.520]  Yeah, the display quality of the nine point seven one inch. It's just
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.380]  Vastly different. I mean the true tone is incredible. It's just the first time
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.680]  When I was setting up the iPad
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.620]  There's the there's the button where it's like would you like to use true tone display?
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.320]  And it's just a little blue button that's like with true tone and then you press it and it turns on without true tone
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.840]  And I made a gif of it because I'm just like this is so stuck
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.120]  Like I didn't even realize the screen was slightly orange and normally I'm very attuned to that stuff
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.600]  Like I couldn't use flux for years on my Mac because it would just drive me crazy
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.880]  But this is much subtler than flux and even much subtler than night shifts to a certain extent. It's just oh wait
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.880]  It's very good. It's very good. I actually think that it is confusing that it's shipped alongside
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:43.980]  Night shift as an OS feature because to me they are no pun intended like night and day
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.680]  where night shift is a very dramatic effect and
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:54.880]  I I've made I've definitely made more people who read Daring Fireball angry with my comments on night shift than anything
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.840]  I've done recently because I'm of the
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.660]  I've linked to numerous of the things that have like Glenn Fleishman had a good piece that
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:07.680]  The science that says that you get a better night's sleep because of this really is very very questionable
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:15.240]  Whether people find it more comfortable for their eyes though that that's completely subjective and I have friends who say oh, man
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:19.120]  I swear by this. I love that. I love I've been using flux for years on my Macs at night
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.120]  And I don't know how people work at night
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.440]  You know how you know
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:27.480]  I work hours and hours every night work late into the night and it's all thanks to flux that my eyes don't get tired
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.320]  I believe that but that doesn't mean you're getting a better night's sleep
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.640]  It just know your eyes are less tired, but if your eyes are less tired like certain other things may improve
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:43.640]  It's correlation me personally. I can't stand it. I find that the color shifting is just gross, but it's also very subjective
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.800]  I just it. I just find it very gross
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.680]  Well, I think whether or not you like the feature or not
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.920]  This is what I'm trying to get it whether you like that feature or not
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.280]  Call it night shift in iOS or flux on your Mac. It is without question
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:03.620]  Very very noticeable very whether you like it or not. I just don't see how anybody could deny that it is a dramatic difference
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.240]  True tone on the other hand while it sounds like it's doing the same thing
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:16.480]  It sounds like it's a similar idea where it's taking sensors and color temperature and shifting the color temperature in practice
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.480]  It is invisible
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.960]  and I think the you kind of hit the nail on the head in terms of the sensors because
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:29.280]  Night shift to my knowledge is almost entirely its geolocation and software based
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.740]  Yeah, and the actual like the range of the tone that's entirely
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:39.140]  Changeable and adjustable in settings. So it really depends its user dependent
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:45.400]  Where you have to go in and shift like how blue or how warm do you want to see your display at night?
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.300]  Whereas true tone takes all of that away
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:54.020]  It's like do you want it on or do you want it off and then just I keep I keep finding that with true tone
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.920]  As I use this iPad Pro more and more I keep thinking like wait
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:04.860]  I have to I keep thinking myself you have totally overblown this feature because there's an it's not doing anything right now
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.140]  Here it is. It's you know, 930 at night
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:13.340]  so it should be you know kicking in because the sun's down and I'm using incandescent lighting and I can just tell looking at
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.060]  This screen that this isn't doing anything at all
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.580]  And then I take any one of my other devices and look at it side by side store it
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:22.140]  Yeah, I'm like, oh my god, that is that is so disgusting
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.380]  It's crazy and like how was I staring at this blue piece of crap?
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:32.300]  but the more that I use it the more I convince myself that it's not doing anything at all until I look at any of
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:37.940]  My other devices that don't have it side by side and I see just how weirdly off all the white
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.420]  You know all the colors are it's it is a wonderful feature
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.100]  Oh
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:48.380]  It makes me it makes me so mad that they hadn't perfected it in November because that would have looked so pretty on the 12.9
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:53.280]  But I yeah, it's it's the problem with releasing different sizes at different times
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.260]  They could have held the entire iPad Pro launch until the spring
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.580]  But because of this is probably where the rumor cycle bites them and other things they wanted to launch the iPad Pro in November
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:08.900]  So they launched what they had and the smaller iPad Pro as a result gets some of the niceties
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:14.460]  It gets the PC 3 it gets the true tone display the camera features. I honestly think is just a
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:21.000]  Yeah, we can fit it in a 9.7 inch and there are people who are gonna use their iPad pros as cameras whether we tell
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.940]  Them to or not and also on the proof of the professional film side
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:29.940]  There are cinematographers who say yeah, the 9.7 inch screen is really nice for location scouting
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.380]  So it would be nice to have a 4k camera. So I get that
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:37.080]  I'm not too heartbroken about not having a 4k camera on my 12.9 inch
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:44.000]  iPad but god do I wish I had true town it does but it is a weird it's just again
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.780]  It's like you said, I think you said it perfectly
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:51.560]  It's it's not like people who have the 12.9 inch iPad Pro are dying to have the better camera
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:57.260]  But it does seem weird now side-by-side that the cheaper smaller one has a better camera than the more expensive bigger one
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:58.980]  Yeah, it seems weird
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.440]  It is it is and it's probably component cheapness like component parts
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:09.620]  Falling after the new year or something else like that or they just didn't you know, they couldn't fit it or the camera bump
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:13.700]  I don't know my guess. Here's my guess. Yes that it was either they couldn't
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:20.240]  Get them in September or they just didn't want to take the chance because it's the same camera
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:27.660]  System as the iPhone 6s and success plus and that to make sure that they wouldn't hamper production of iPhones
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.620]  They didn't want to put it in
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:34.140]  they just don't want to either they either they knew they couldn't get enough of them or that they just didn't want to take a
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:40.180]  Chance of putting a hiccup in the iPhone supply chain. I believe that especially pre-christmas, right?
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:44.460]  That's just that's a it's a dangerous thing to have right because that first quarter is
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.860]  Just it's crazy how high-stakes it is for Apple because it's both the launch quarter and the holiday quarter. Oh, yeah
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:54.660]  They I mean they crammed so much stuff in this past year
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.540]  And I thought I thought last year was a little bit crazy
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:03.180]  But but this year they really just like alright, we got the phones. We got the iPad. We've got the Apple TV
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.100]  We're just gonna go we're gonna go we're gonna make it happen
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:11.700]  the other thing the 9.7 does not have and this is the the thing that I think
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:16.300]  Ultimately will keep me from switching to it is the USBC quick charge
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:23.060]  Right, it's really nice being able to use USB 3 being able to take advantage of that quick charge because the 12 watt adapter
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.420]  Like I mean granted I rarely charge my iPad except overnight
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.460]  So I don't get a huge amount of use out of it
[01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:37.020]  But on the days when I'm like I have cut audio caught audio and cut video on my iPad before and in those days
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:44.060]  I will bring like my you the new USB C charger that I just got which was strangely shipped alongside the
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.340]  9.7 inch iPad but the 9.7 inch iPad not
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:52.820]  Not able to use it and that thing that thing actually charges like a laptop charger
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:58.620]  Like it makes it makes the iPad actually have a have a charger that is functional
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.740]  Whereas before like the 12 watt adapter trying to plug that into the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. It's like, okay
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:09.260]  If you're plugging this in while you're working on it, you're gonna see your battery drop 2%
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.260]  Yeah, it doesn't do anything, right?
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.540]  You really kind of have to just sit there and wait
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:21.020]  Yeah, and I find that the iPads I do find one of the advantages of it and I don't think that the battery life estimates
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.500]  Really the the the published tech specs for the battery life of these devices to me
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.220]  It it's misleading because I don't I get way more battery life out of an iPad
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.940]  Then the specs would show compared
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.260]  Oh, yeah
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:39.660]  book and I think it's simply the I think it's simply the basis that I actually I tend to run a
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.400]  Stupid number of Safari tabs at a time and I have a stupid number of apps that are open at a time
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:52.540]  And so there's just more going on as like a baseline CPU level on any of my macbooks compared to the iPad
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:55.260]  Which enforces this sort of mostly one app at a time?
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:26:01.700]  Thing and you know, like Safari you can have a bunch of tabs open, but only the frontmost tab actually is running anything
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:05.180]  I just get practically speaking
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:10.940]  If I start the day with a full charge, I can't use the iPad enough to really run it down
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:15.180]  I just can't there's nothing I can seem to do and so I don't I sometimes I I
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.060]  Wake up and if I'm it's like hey
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.660]  Let's use this iPad Pro because I want still wanna write this review and I realize I haven't even charged it in two or three
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:28.220]  Days and the battery still functional right and the battery is kind of low because I just haven't plugged it in in days
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:34.340]  Yeah, which never ever happens with with other devices because you just are vaguely aware that you know
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.580]  If you're doing a lot of work on a macbook
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:39.120]  You need to charge it at some point and same thing with an iPhone throughout the day
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.140]  Like you just don't accidentally go three or four days without charging your phone
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:49.740]  No, because it just it wouldn't work or your Apple watch but with the iPad, it's actually it's possible. It's very possible
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:54.780]  Yeah, especially if you don't use it a hundred percent of this like the iPad Pro if you're using it
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:57.100]  Like you'd use a laptop. It's pretty normal to
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:02.340]  Kill it or kill like 75% of the battery on a on a full day is work
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.460]  but if you're just using it
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:09.640]  You know like you do where you're using the iPad for reading and maybe a little bit of writing and you're going on the go
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.220]  You can you can get like three or four days out of charge of that thing. That's crazy
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:19.700]  But it is true though that the USB the super USB C charging on the iPad the big iPad Pro
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.180]  Is is a tremendous feature and once you've had it, it's it's really it's one of the it's another one of those things
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:28.900]  where once you've had it on one device, it's really hard to go back to any of your other devices and
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:35.580]  Accept the fact that it takes seemingly forever to charge them. Yeah. Yeah, and and
[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:39.060]  Cuz I do I do like a lot of the 9.7 inch
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:43.740]  iPads like the true tone is so beautiful and I love by the way
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:48.580]  I love that it turns off whenever you go into a photo editing program. Yeah
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:52.540]  Um, so it automatically it automatically understands that which is pretty great
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:58.380]  but also I used an 11-inch MacBook Air for so long that I'm like
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:05.740]  9.7 inches isn't really that much smaller. I could totally do work and after two weeks on this
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.500]  I'm just like I just like the 12.9 inch screen so much better for
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:17.100]  Like physical like the multitasking but it just doesn't the two iPad mini apps side-by-side just doesn't work for me on the 9 7
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:22.700]  No, I agree. Well, I don't it doesn't work as well because it doesn't feel as much the way that on the
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.420]  12.9. It feels like to full
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:31.660]  They're not quite full-size, but they feel like to full-size iPad side-by-side and on the the smaller iPad
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:35.660]  You don't get that small iPad is is bicycling uphill if you're trying to multitask
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.980]  Anyway, long story short. I think it's a tremendous device and I think people's anger had it is misplaced
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:47.880]  And I think it's kind of fascinating how true it has stayed to the original iPad
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:52.340]  Idea from 2010. Yeah. Yeah, I'm
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:29:01.620]  Sometimes to its to its dismay. I'm really annoyed that that stupid FaceTime camera is still in portrait orientation
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:07.620]  Especially given the iPad Pro moniker where you're kind of you know
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:12.700]  You're pitching it on the idea that you're probably going to use it in a keyboard case for a certain amount of time
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:19.000]  So if you ever use FaceTime or Skype your video is often weird to the side
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.500]  It's like one of my such a little pet peeve about the hardware, but it's so irritating
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.220]  Yeah, it's I don't see what they how they that's a tough design problem though
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:32.740]  Because other than putting a second FaceTime camera in at the other spot. I
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.660]  Don't know what else they could do. Yeah
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:42.760]  Yeah, it's I mean it's it's definitely it's difficult if you're assuming that people are going to want to use it in portrait
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:48.000]  And with the 9-7 I get that a little bit more because the 9-7 is comfortable to use in portrait
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.340]  but the 12-9 is is so
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.940]  Gargantuan in portrait that it just feels wrong to use it that way
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:59.360]  like it just doesn't it's not comfortable in any way shape or form and
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:06.960]  I don't know. But yeah, but you're absolutely right. It's like do you put in two cameras and then have extra space there?
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:14.220]  Do you kill the portrait orientation FaceTime camera and then make people who hold the 9-7 in portrait have an issue?
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.720]  It goes back again. It's another thing that goes back to the original usability
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:24.800]  Well, the original iPad the original iPad had in prototypes had two 30-pin connectors one
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:32.640]  that's right plot one for landscape and one for portrait and it was decided so late in the game to get rid of
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:39.420]  It that the the coordinate system of the I put what was then called iPad OS was based on
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Landscape as the default orientation
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:50.900]  Even though the they ended up shipping it where the 30-pin connector was on the bottom because remember there were and again
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:55.580]  Like no coming full circle. The original iPad had a hardware keyboard accessory
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:59.860]  It was just instead of being like a cover. It was actually like a little hard. Yeah the iPad dock
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:05.380]  Yeah, and but you had to you know, the only way to mount it was to put it in portrait
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.060]  which was a little bit weird because you know, I
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.540]  You know as evidenced by what they've ended up coming back to with the smart keyboard
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:19.500]  When you do have a keyboard attached it makes more sense to be in landscape. Yeah overall
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.420]  no, I did it just feels more natural and
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.860]  Especially if you're multitasking because multitasking portrait just doesn't make sense
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:31.580]  Right, but it's just a funny thing that they've that they've come back to
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:34.660]  But in the same way you can see why in
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:39.840]  Theory, you might want to have smart connectors on the bottom and the side, but I can see why Apple
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.780]  It didn't do that. Yep
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:49.340]  All right, let's take a break before we move on to new topics unless there's anything else you want to talk about with iPad Pro
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:53.340]  No, I think I think I've gotten through most of it
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:58.060]  I encourage everybody to try pencils if they haven't already because I do think it's really fun
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:01.260]  Even if you don't think you're an artist or don't think you're gonna draw
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:07.580]  Well, not the worst thing you could blow 99 bucks on no exactly. They're far far less useful. Thanks
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:13.820]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Casper. Casper is an online retailer of
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:19.460]  Premium mattresses that they sell for a fraction of the price of their their mainstream competitors
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.540]  the mattress industry is
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:27.980]  Notorious for forcing consumers into paying notoriously high markups and from having incredibly confusing product arrays
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.100]  Where if you're going to buy, you know brand X at this store
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:35.100]  And then you go to another store to try to compare the exact same mattresses from the same company
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.500]  They all have different product names, even though they're sort of the same mattress
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:42.460]  But that's just to keep you confused and make it really hard to do comparison shopping
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:46.740]  And they ask you to make all these decisions that you don't know what what the difference is
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.620]  Casper makes this so easy. They have one mattress style. It's
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:55.980]  a combination of two technologies latex foam and memory foam
[01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:58.060]  They just it's just right
[01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:03.380]  You don't have to choose whether you want this kind of foam or that kind of foam just trust Casper that they've made the right
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:06.020]  Kind of foam to make a good mattress
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:11.940]  Big name name brand mattresses often cost well over 1,500 bucks
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.820]  Casper mattresses cost between 500 for a twin size mattress 600 for twin XL
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:23.020]  750 for full-size 850 for Queen and just 950 bucks for a king-size mattress
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:29.660]  High quality they ship them to you like vacuum sealed into these remarkably small
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:34.060]  Not magically small but surprisingly small for like a queen or a king-size mattress
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:39.220]  I don't know what the smaller ones are like, but probably even remarkably smaller you put it in a room
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:44.220]  You want you open the box they have instructions on the box do it this way you open it up and it just like magically
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.540]  grows into a full-size mattress
[01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:53.580]  It's completely risk-free this is the thing you think well, how am I gonna buy a mattress for a thousand bucks and not even try
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:57.700]  It here's the deal. They have free delivery and returns
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:01.900]  No questions asked for a hundred days. It's that simple
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.740]  So pick the size you want get it shipped to you if you're in if you need a new mattress
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.940]  Try it out try it for three months
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:15.940]  And if you don't like it just to go back to the Casper comm website and say you want to send it back and they'll
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.540]  Take care of it and they'll have a somebody come and take it out of your house

[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.300]  at Casper comm
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.620]  So what else is going on this week what else we got did you try the iPhone SE
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:55.060]  Um, I did I I don't have one but I I've picked it up. I have put it in my hand
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.060]  I've put it in my pocket and
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:03.000]  I think I'm stuck with this 4.7 inch. It's it's it's nice in a lot of ways
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:06.620]  And I do really like the 4-inch screen
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.780]  but I my
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:15.060]  My downgrade was going from the 6s plus to the 6s and I don't think I could go from the 6s plus
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:21.860]  All the way to the iPhone SE. So since I published my review, I've noticed one new thing and I didn't notice it beforehand because
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.780]  The way I think it's just the nature of the weather when I was writing to my SE review
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:34.280]  But it's that an outside on a sunny day the extra contrast of the newer displays is noticeable
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:38.740]  Really there I was out the other day. I'm still using the SE as my main phone and
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.660]  It wasn't super sunny
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:46.620]  But it was like a nice a nice April day in Philadelphia and I realized I couldn't read the phone and I was like wow
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:52.500]  That's weird because I know that if I had my 6s I could read it and I had to get in the shade or something like
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.660]  That so I think the extra contrast
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:02.180]  It's it's harder to notice I to me indoors or not in the bright sunshine, but in sunshine it it makes a difference
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:02.900]  Yeah
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.940]  I can I can definitely see that and
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:11.740]  Given given how often I strangely use my phone in sunshine despite not being somebody who goes outside a lot
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.180]  Yeah, I don't know I our newest
[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:21.060]  Our newest employee at I'm or Lori Gill just got she's been waiting two years
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:27.940]  For them to upgrade the 4-inch model and she just got an SE and she loves it. She's like can't stop singing its praises
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.540]  Yeah, I hope that you know, I hope they keep the size along. I hope so
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:36.820]  I don't I'd really really I'm the you know, and I know I wrote about it and talked about a reason
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:40.180]  I really am convinced that they're not gonna have a 4-inch phone this September
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:45.260]  But you know, I just hope they keep it up to date enough that it seems relevant for people who prefer it
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:49.140]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't even mind if they kept it on a March schedule right as a like
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:53.860]  I mean 30 million people is still a lot quite a lot of buyers and 30 million people
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:37:00.940]  Continue to buy this as kind of their again their their pseudo low-cost iPhone where it's not quite an iPhone
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.340]  You know 6 6 C
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:10.260]  But it's it's an option for people who want a slightly cheaper iPhone that has maybe like six months ago internals
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:16.140]  But also the the 4-inch form factor a lot of a lot of really good stuff on the camera
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:22.380]  Like it is really the fact that they have all of the camera features. Well, most of the camera features plugged into the 4-inch
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:29.980]  screen like that's it's a really nice device if you want something small and portable to run around and take photos with I
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:35.900]  Find it. I really do find it using it as a camera and it's one of the things I knew this
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:43.140]  But going back it's like the same way that like whenever you get a faster iPhone, you know that it's faster
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:47.700]  But sometimes the best way to actually feel how much faster it is is give it a couple of weeks and then go back to
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:51.020]  Your older phone and then going to the slower one actually
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:57.920]  Shows you how much faster the new one is than using the faster one because you get used to the fastness of the fast one
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:03.160]  And to me the grip ability of the of the device, especially when used as a camera
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:07.240]  Just I don't know just the way I tend to hold the phone when I'm taking pictures
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:13.080]  It feels so much more secure in my hands than the the round sided success
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.920]  form factor I
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.440]  Really? Hope that someone in Apple's design team maybe Johnny but some either someone in his team
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:29.120]  I don't know takes a look at how many people are praising the fact that they're going they went back to the 5s form factor
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:33.960]  and really takes a good hard look about what the iPhone 7 shape is gonna look like because
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.840]  Like I have not used any of the six success series phones without a case
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.180]  I just can't I can't do it because I've shattered three of them
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.920]  Like it just does not fit like it's a beautiful device
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.760]  Like I have the 6s and rose gold right now and it's I wish I could use it without a case
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:56.040]  But it it just does not feel like it'll slide out of my hand
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.600]  I would once I would love to know because you know Apple knows this
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.960]  Oh, yeah is exactly what percentage of these devices have been dropped at least have been dropped such that they require
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.760]  Right or even just brought in maybe you know
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.140]  Maybe it's like a minor crack or scratch or something and then when the person's told what it cost they choose not to do it
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.960]  But at least registers as a this person dropped their phone
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:25.360]  I cannot help but think that the number of people who've dropped their success and success plus is
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.600]  Greater and maybe part of that is just because it's bigger
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.640]  But I can't help but think that's part of it is because of the round sides
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.660]  Oh, yeah, the super cynic in me is like Apple wanted to sell more Apple care plus and they're like, alright
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:41.920]  Let's just go to this this design factor because it's gotta be it's gotta be like 20 30 percent, right?
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.780]  I mean, maybe not people who actually get it repaired, but I
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.660]  You know, I'm pretty careful with my phones
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:52.380]  I don't you know fling them across the room and I generally try and you know
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.020]  Keep them free of scratches because I got to take pictures of them
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:40:01.980]  But I'm careful and I dropped my phone, you know, probably three feet and had it shatter into a million pieces
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:08.060]  So, I don't know. I'm I'm I'm really my track record is that I've never once bought
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:15.020]  I haven't bought Apple care for any any device since my original the first Mac I ever bought in 1991 Wow
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.660]  I haven't I just don't buy Apple care and at this point
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:25.620]  I I mean I've saved so much money by not buying Apple care for anything that you know, I I could I could buy like a
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:32.180]  even like a brand new MacBook Pro and have it go completely dead as soon as the day after the the
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:37.580]  You know, the the one-year warranty goes up and still be ahead because of all the money
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:39.900]  I haven't spent on Apple care over the years
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.700]  So I'm just not a believer in it because I take I try to be careful
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:47.100]  maybe I've just had good luck with not getting lemons and
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:55.500]  With iPhones, I I've had a couple of drops over the years and I remember one time with my original iPhone
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:00.220]  I had a drop where it was gonna it was gonna hit like a cement floor and I
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:04.540]  Shot my right foot out and kind of I didn't quite catch it with my foot
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:11.660]  But it like almost caught it with my foot such that it then only dropped about like four inches onto the sidewalk
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:15.540]  and it was like completely unscathed and I was like, wow, that was
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:21.100]  Very lucky. It was very live is a lot more lucky than coordinated it with my
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.700]  Level of coordination. It was pretty good
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:30.100]  so I had no no screen breakages one time with the original phone almost it seemed like I was destined to but it didn't so
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:35.880]  I've had the iPhone the iPhone 3g 3gs the 4 the 4s
[01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:41.200]  The 5 the 5s and up into that point had never once broken the screen
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:48.640]  The worst I'd ever gotten it was everyone always seemed to develop a scratch on the screen at some point and I never once
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.040]  Did I ever remember like when that happened?
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:56.760]  It was just be like one day in certain lighting. I would notice like a very fine scratch and I would be very sad
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.460]  But certainly I've never once had a scratch that I would even consider going in and paying, you know
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.560]  Whatever the prices were to get a new screen. Yeah
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:12.240]  Um, and then when I had the iPhone 6 within like the first three months of owning it
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:15.560]  I had two times where I dropped it and the screen cracked. Yep
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:23.160]  It's just it those corners are a really hard to grip and be prone to breaking because of that slightly wrapped glass
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.160]  it just doesn't
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:32.300]  It's beautiful in a beautiful in a conference room beautiful in a sealed factory. Not so great when there's
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:37.780]  Hardwood and concrete wherever you go, you know, and so part of it might just be luck
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.140]  But it just seemed to me like having it happen twice and then you know
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.700]  Now that was a year ago
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:48.420]  and then I've been using for the most part since then the same size phone either that that iPhone 6 or
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.660]  You know in the last six months my success and haven't dropped that
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:58.900]  But I think I have to be more I feel like I have to it's because I'm more conscious of how I'm conscientious
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:03.060]  Maybe it's the better word of how I'm holding the phone. Yeah after two screen breaks
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:06.480]  You kind of you have to adjust your your usability, right?
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.300]  And the one time I did it it was I was I really was I was
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:13.300]  Framing a photograph and it just slipped I don't even know how it slipped out of my hands
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:18.060]  it just slipped right out of my hands like a bar soap and just fell straight down onto a carpeted floor and
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.460]  and it was again a store and
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:25.980]  I thought I was fine. It's a carpeted floor picked it up. Nope. Totally shattered
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.580]  Oh
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.580]  That's that's the worst but I couldn't believe it that it wasn't like I butterfingered it
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:36.340]  It wasn't like I butterfingered it taking out of my pocket or something or while you were holding
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:41.300]  I was holding it and framing a photograph and as I tried to move my thumb to take the thing it just went shoot
[01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:48.540]  Never ever happened with any previous iPhone. Oh my gosh. Yep. Yeah, so I'm I am pro
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:55.420]  Different form factor as pretty as this is I would really like to not wrap my phone in a giant case
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:56.460]  Oh, you know what?
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:03.080]  I've been using the I've been using the Apple battery case on the 6s because I I was a little worried going back from my success
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:06.340]  Plus that the the lack of battery life was gonna kill me
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:12.100]  And and I actually really aside from the fact that it's white. I hate the fact that the battery case is white
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:17.500]  But I actually kind of like this this feels really good in the hand and I'm kind of shocked by that
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.900]  Yeah, it gives you I'm telling every and I I said it and everybody, you know
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:26.860]  I think Marco said it on his podcast recently the the way that you can rest your pinkies on the back of the hump
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:32.000]  Oh, it's so nice. It's very very nice. It's actually it's a very strange looking thing
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.460]  But in hand it actually feels very nice
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:40.780]  Yeah, and honestly, you know, you don't really see the hump because the hump is usually in your hand, you know
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:48.220]  You're not you're not usually laying it out for people to enjoy the fact that you have a little credit card sized battery
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:54.860]  Attached to the back of your case. It's actually an interesting contrast with our earlier discussion of the Apple TV remote
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:57.220]  which is designed
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:04.320]  seemingly only to appeal visually and and in hand as a lot of problems to to
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:09.780]  That we can go on at length again about whereas the Apple battery case
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:15.700]  Absolutely positively looks a little funny, but I think is designed very practically
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:18.300]  to be both useful and
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:25.740]  Pretty pleasant to hold. Yeah fits wonderfully in the hand and has a lot of design perks that I you know
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.960]  That I've used battery cases on and off for covering shows and going to Disneyland in various places
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:36.640]  For for years and this is by far the easiest battery case I've ever had to use
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.820]  mostly because I never have to take it out of the case and
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.780]  Even if I do it's it's pretty easy with the with the slip out
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:48.620]  So I know you probably talked about this like six months ago when it came out in the first place
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:53.300]  But has somebody who's only been using it for a couple weeks. I'm really kind of thrilled about it
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:56.820]  yeah, I'm curious whether how well it's selling because
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:59.900]  Will they keep doing them?
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:00.380]  Yeah
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.140]  I feel like if they do I
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:07.580]  Feel like the schedule will stay the same where if they come out with new iPhones in September
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:15.020]  They're not going to come out with the battery case until like November because they don't want the PR of Apple's shipping a phone
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:19.620]  That needs a battery. It needs it needs the case and I wouldn't say for the average user
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:21.860]  I don't think the iPhone does need a battery case
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:24.620]  It's just you know for people like you and but it looks bad, right?
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:29.820]  Exactly exactly and and also R&D and just you know spacing all of that out
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:36.220]  But yeah, you don't you don't want the negative press associated with that. I hope if they do release another battery case
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:42.460]  They also considered doing colors besides just stark white and I don't know if it's space gray or well
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:43.260]  I don't like to call it
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:43.580]  But yeah
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:43.900]  exactly
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:49.580]  whatever whatever slate gray because you have this beautiful rose gold iPhone and I would love to actually put it in a case that
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:54.900]  Reflects its internal personality right now. It just looks like it's in a I don't know a crazy Ward
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:47:00.020]  It's I feel like it's wearing a straight jacket right now. I think it was a sort of a very stormtrooper II look
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.180]  Yeah. Yeah, I see that actually isn't necessarily what everybody wants on there. No
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.180]  exactly
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:12.620]  It's like now now I wish I had a space gray case because then I could at least call the phone Finn and I would be
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.020]  amused to myself
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:18.060]  All right. Let me take one last break and then we'll go with the stormtrooper theme and talk about
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.820]  the Star Wars
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:25.420]  Rogue one trailer our last sponsor is a brand new

[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:39.160]  Who is on this podcast? You guys did like a 90-minute podcast about a 90-second movie trailer?
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:46.440]  Mm-hmm. That's not even the first one we've done. It was it was me, Sarah Cusa, Dan Morin and and Jason. It's
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.240]  Ridiculous, I know we did the same thing for force awakens
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:54.300]  I think the force awakens was like 60-second teaser and we did at least 90 minutes on it
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:59.200]  All right. I'm I have kept my mouth shut on Twitter about this, but I'm gonna come out now and I
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:06.360]  Did not like the trailer for Rogue One. Really? Okay. So why why did you not like the trailer? I'm curious. Uh, I
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.720]  I
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.720]  thought that it was
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:14.280]  It felt like what my concern ever since they've announced these Star Wars
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:20.160]  Stories and for anybody who's not paying close attention that just is this is not the next movie in the the new trilogy
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:25.880]  After the force awakens, it's a standalone movie even takes place in a different era. It takes place before
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:33.360]  Like between the two older trilogies so it's like what is it like five years before Star Wars a new hope
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.880]  It's like when the first Death Star is being built. It's um, yeah, it's some time
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:45.660]  Pablo Hidalgo who's the story supervisor at Lucasfilm was like it is some time in the 30 years between the end of
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.040]  Episode 3 and the start of episode 4 and I'm like great. Thanks. That's that's really helpful
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:57.280]  I I just felt like the trailer felt like what I was worried that it would be which is like a
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:04.480]  Lesser purposefully lesser Star Wars movie that it just didn't feel like it had any kind of grand or as much
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.660]  There's one shot of the Death Star that to me add some grandeur to it
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:11.720]  But for the most part it looked more like a generic action
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:19.060]  Sci-fi movie than a Star Wars movie and I felt like it was cut way too quick like cut cut cut cut cut, you know
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:25.440]  One second shot one second shot one second shot cut cut cut frenetic and then it's over
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:29.720]  Frenetic is the right is the right verb for this is that it does it does feel very
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.180]  Much much more energetic than what you think of as traditional Star Wars trailers
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:43.440]  like you think about even the force awakens trailer or any of the original trailers is the the long sweeping shot of Tatooine right or the
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.920]  the long shot of of
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:52.400]  You know Rey and her garb or I thought like in the force awakens trailer, which I thought was a great trailer
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.200]  I the one the shot that to me made the trailer was the shot on
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.160]  Jakku
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.360]  it's a real long shot of a
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:07.000]  Star Destroyer Star Destroyer that's crashed into the planet for it and seemingly for a long time
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.320]  I had that as my background on my computer for a long time because it's a beautiful shot
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:17.680]  Yeah, beautiful shot, but it also to me has like this very Star Wars Ian this to it, which is
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:19.680]  It
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:25.400]  There's clearly a lot of backstory that you don't know there's something you know
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:32.000]  Cuz there's obviously there's a massive Star Destroyer crashed on a desert planet. Is this happens? Yeah, are we on Tatooine again?
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.200]  Are we somewhere else? You don't know but there's obviously something happened
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.880]  Whereas there's nothing in the rogue one trailer that makes me wonder. Wow, what happened there?
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.400]  That's there's some kind of crazy backstory here. Yeah, so I have to ask you
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:48.680]  Have you watched Star Wars rebels the CG cartoon? Yes, in fact my
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:51.640]  Jonas and I just finished
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:57.080]  Catching up last finale. Oh my gosh. All right. Well, we'll save that. I feel like that's way too spoilery
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:03.180]  But um, well big is there something you want to say that's not spoilery about? Well, yes, so well sort of pseudo spoilery
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:06.840]  Just more that I when I watched the rogue one trailer
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:12.360]  my first impression was a lot of these scenes seem like exact real worlds like
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:18.440]  Let me let me take all of the shots and staging that I've done with Star Wars rebels and let me put it in a live
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:21.080]  action movie like some of those marketplace scenes the scenes where
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.800]  Where I think your name is Jin
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.800]  the the protagonist for Rogue One
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:31.400]  Is like running through and kicking around stormtroopers and I'm like this this literally feels like a scene
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:37.640]  With Sabine from Star Wars rebels where and then the whole trailer kind of feels like that where rebels
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:44.560]  Rebels and Clone Wars before it to me aren't really they don't seem focused on the Star Wars grandeur, right?
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:51.480]  It's not it. These are more telling like very quick standalone slight not even slice of life stories, but slice of Star Wars
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.980]  I guess where they just kind of drop you right in the middle of the action and they're just like, alright go
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:02.640]  You there's there's some stuff, you know some backstory that's helpful to know but it's not really about building, you know
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:08.140]  It's not about telling the grand Joseph Campbell story. It's about here. Here's this, you know
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:13.440]  This specific action and this specific thing that's happening to these people who happen to exist in this larger world
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.520]  and
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:21.560]  that's kind of the the vibe that I got from the Rogue One trailer is it's very much it jumps you right into the fact where
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.560]  it's like
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.800]  You either know where this is where this is and what's happening and you know
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.680]  What what the add-ats are and you know what that lady with short red hair is and and what her you know?
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.560]  Overwhelming significance is to the the greater Star Wars universe or you don't
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.960]  and I
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.040]  Don't know. It's I I understand where you're coming from about the you know
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.360]  It doesn't it doesn't have the grandeur of a of a Star Wars a Star Wars trailer or even feel
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.500]  So much like your traditional Star Wars movie. It's it's a very gritty
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:58.500]  Sort of down-in-the-dirt version of it. Yeah, and I also feel like it just doesn't I
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:02.300]  Don't know to me like a teaser trailer is supposed to
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.700]  Show you less but make it more. I
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:13.300]  Don't know. I I don't I just feel like that cut cut cut style and I don't think that the movie is gonna be like that
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:15.300]  I certainly hope not
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:17.580]  But I don't know I feel like
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:24.340]  I get like for a first teaser, I'd rather just have it be one cool shot for the whole teaser and that's it
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:29.380]  And then as opposed to they kind of went the opposite way and tried to show like a ton of stuff
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:36.100]  Yeah, they should so this is this is something that's interesting to me in that based this I mean, this is the first visual
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:41.380]  We've really seen a rogue one in about a year because last year we saw that that teaser one sheet of like them
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.380]  the the group standing together
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.300]  and
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:53.140]  Based on everything I've read up about rogue one up until the point where the teaser trailer was released my
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:58.100]  My inclination was this was going to be oceans 11 in Star Wars
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:00.300]  where it was where it was supposed to be a
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:06.900]  heist movie right where it's basically like she gets the team together and they build up everybody and then they go in and they might
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.900]  Have to go undercover and it's not necessarily like jokey oceans 11
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:15.740]  But it's the it's the same kind of beat and style and then this teaser trailer comes out
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:17.740]  and the teaser trailer is
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:23.260]  Almost the exact opposite of what I would expect from a heist movie
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:29.060]  Right, you think you think about teaser trailers for heist movies, right? You think about even any of the Mission Impossible trailers
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:36.300]  Where if I look carefully at the trailer you can kind of spot scenes or it's like oh
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:44.300]  This is from the place where they're getting the gang together and here's where they probably have to go undercover and are running from Imperials
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:46.660]  Yeah, here's where they're breaking into the unbreakable safe
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:53.340]  Yeah, exactly exactly, but it's but it's told in such a different way and I'm curious about that
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:57.380]  I'm curious if it actually is a heist movie and they're just their teeth right now
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:03.700]  The tease is really we're just teasing you about our main character and it's not even so much about the movie
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:09.300]  And that's part of the reason of the cut cut cut cut is that our main character is you know?
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:15.580]  our protagonists is a fast-paced like I'm gonna you know, either get into scrapes and
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:21.780]  Be around explosions and end up in a cross between an Inquisitor's uniform and a TIE fighter
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:24.420]  outfit at some point I
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:29.060]  I don't know. It's it's interesting to me what kind of story they're trying to tell
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:34.100]  and also I have lots of questions about the main character herself and how these
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:41.500]  Stand-alone stories are supposed to fit into the star the greater Star Wars universe because I've had people argue on on both sides
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.460]  Right. I've had people argue
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:47.340]  Oh, well, these are supposed to be entirely separate and they're really more like, you know
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.740]  Dives into backstory and they don't involve the main the main plot at all
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:53.500]  But but then I look at the other
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:58:00.140]  Stand-alone stories they have, you know slotted and they've got the young Han Solo movie don't I'm like started
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:02.020]  Oh, I know. I know I know
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:04.020]  but but my thought is
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:10.780]  Well, if they're going to tell these standalone stories that you know may or may not revolve around major characters
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:18.500]  What's to say that whatever happens in this movie? No, it may not, you know directly be an installment of the force awakens
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:26.620]  Sort of trilogy, but I'm I'm not entirely unconvinced that there's there's stuff that's gonna happen into this in this movie
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:33.340]  That's going to be very important in episode 8 and episode 9 not necessarily on a grand scale, but you know stuff
[01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:39.580]  There's there's all kinds of potential theories there and I feel like we would take three hours trying to discuss them all because we took
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:45.460]  Two hours on incomparable. I love the idea of calling it like oceans 11 in the Star Wars universe is exactly
[01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:51.500]  I if that's what it turns out being even in some small just in a general direction. That would make me very happy
[01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:55.500]  I think the trailer certainly doesn't suggest that no trailer makes it seem like
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:02.140]  It's and I don't know that I hope it's not. I just think I I just worry that there is a sort of
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:09.380]  That the trailer is the teaser that we got is the result of a dysfunctional
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:13.500]  Executive
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:20.420]  leadership at the new Lucasfilm in Disney that it's less about making a super awesome trailer that
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:25.700]  That takes Star Wars in the new direction and more about wait. We just made this great hit movie
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:32.180]  Let's just make the most generic Star Wars trailer we could out of the footage we have because we you know
[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:34.260]  We don't want to take any risks at all
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:38.820]  That I guess is to me what I I found a little
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:46.500]  Disappointing in this is that to me it didn't seem like they took any risks at all other than the I will admit that the the
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:49.740]  Although it to me it only continues a direction
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:53.980]  They started with a force awakens where clearly the protagonist is a woman and not a man
[01:59:53.980 --> 02:00:00.720]  Which is a significant change from traditional action movies and from the previous Star Wars movies
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:06.180]  But I would almost say that that's after the force awakens. That's a lot less
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:12.060]  They don't even get as much credit for the risk because I feel like that risk was already taken in the force awakened
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:15.220]  Mm-hmm. Well, they're continuing the story
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:17.400]  I have a lot of faith in Kathleen Kennedy
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:22.400]  Just as a as the head of Lucasfilm and her ability to put together a good team
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:26.940]  But there is there is a minor worry on my part about what Rogue One is going to look like
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.660]  Because we think about traditional Star Wars trailers and traditional Star Wars movies, right?
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:36.820]  Your first trailer usually comes about a year out like I would have expected to see the teaser
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:40.620]  Attached to the force awakens, right or it maybe even not on lunch
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:46.660]  But like six weeks into the force awakens come see it again. And now the road one teaser will be attached, right?
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:52.300]  Damn, they should hire you spread it. That's that's genius. That would have gotten it's good marketing, right?
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.580]  I would go a second time just to see the 32nd 62nd spot
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.460]  but
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.860]  if you think about
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:02.620]  traditional like medium budget movies a trailer a
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:06.300]  First teaser six months out is not an unusual thing
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:11.540]  But for a Star Wars movie to not have a teaser until six months out is it's almost crazy
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:18.040]  It's like this is your first trailer and you're still probably gonna have like another teaser and a couple full-length trailers
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:24.300]  It's like you're getting really close to the wire and I'm not sure if that's intentional on their part that they don't want to take
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:30.880]  They don't want to pull too much focus away from the big the big movies the trilogy movies or whether there were some
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:36.520]  Issues with Rogue One where they had to do some, you know, some post-production story editing or things like that
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:43.160]  I've been a little worried hearing like with the radio silence around it that it is it was like a story problem
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.140]  Hmm, but I don't know. I really don't like that's that's the that's the thing right now is
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.680]  we have this one trailer and
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:54.360]  the original description of Rogue One and that one sheet and that's all we know about this movie and
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.660]  I I want to be tentatively excited because I the potential even if the trailer
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:06.160]  you know the trailer I think is some somewhat Star Wars and somewhat very not Star Wars and that the
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.520]  Visuals are all right to me
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:12.720]  The quick cutting may not be your style and it's not quite Star Wars as a style either
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:18.140]  but the visuals look great the brief moment of characterization that we have from
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:24.600]  basically, Jin and Mon Mothma are really the only people who get more than a line or two in this and and
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.040]  Forest Whitaker's crazy
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.500]  character with the breathing apparatus
[02:02:31.660 --> 02:02:37.580]  What's with all the respiratory illnesses? I'm so curious. Well, it's lots of lots of desert planets, John
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:41.100]  I feel I feel like there's probably some some issues with health there
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:46.560]  They're like they don't show it but everybody in the Star Wars universe smokes. Yeah, exactly. They just don't show it on
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:49.860]  That's how you can get deal with the hazards of space
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:56.420]  Vaping. Oh god. Um, I don't know Jin is really interesting to me as a character
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.980]  I talked about it a little bit on on the incomparable podcast
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:05.300]  But I I'm really curious if they're going to tie her into the main story
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:10.620]  Like does she die before episode four because she's not she's obviously not in the rebels hangar
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:16.940]  Like she's she's not around and I don't know if you read any of the extended universe books
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:23.100]  but like one of my thoughts was well, are they gonna do a Mara Jade style thing where this you know, this basically one of the
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:27.540]  prominent badass lady characters in the extended universe books was
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:33.460]  was a character who you know was kind of very gray for a long time and that the the
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:38.300]  Possibility of telling a story like a Star Wars story that's not light side and dark side
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:43.860]  That is like that centers around a gray character that that part really excites me
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:48.420]  and that's kind of what the trailer seemed to be flirting with was the idea of like
[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:53.720]  Yeah, we're not we're not going to tell us a story about a grand arc and a Joseph Campbell story
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.160]  We're gonna tell a story about like the people who have to make the hard decisions who aren't
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:01.920]  you know who don't always get to stand on the side of light or the side of dark and
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.800]  no, it's
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.560]  I'm excited. I it's I see where you're hesitant and I see where you're concerned
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.880]  But I'm also I'm still kind of like there are a lot of potential good things here
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.640]  It doesn't make me pass them it makes me a little bit more pessimistic than it was
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:20.900]  But I was already kind of pessimistic about the movie
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:24.800]  But the thing that it's just disappointing because to me it wasn't a great trailer
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:31.640]  To me a great trailer makes me someone to say I want to see that movie today and Rogue One trailer did not do that
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:34.600]  For me at all. It just kind of gave me a I can wait
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:41.300]  See I really like the trailer. All right. All right. Well, that's why you know, yeah to have it's good to have different exactly
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:46.340]  Exactly. I know. Yeah, I feel like you're allowed to not like the trailer and I'm allowed to like the trailer and I hope
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.480]  That the first real trailer is a little bit less cut cut cut II
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.740]  in part because you know
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:57.780]  they have a there's a lot of really pretty really pretty scenes that look like they were being shot in the
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.740]  Half a second that we got did you think it was weird that the Death Star seemed fully constructed? I
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:08.800]  Mean they didn't show it in a long shot. They only showed like they showed that like the dish
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:13.020]  Yeah being put in so who knows maybe if you pull back or it's you know
[02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:17.060]  Cuz yeah, they might still be like with bits and pieces. We've seen in progress Death Stars before, right?
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:23.640]  Well, I what that makes me wonder how close are we to a new hope right because in a new hope the Death Star
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:29.300]  Like the Death Star was close to fully operational. It was flying between planets. It was shooting things
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:33.060]  So it may have just been one of those things where
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:38.300]  Everything was built safe for the firing dish or maybe they have to replace the firing dish
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:42.060]  I don't know. There's there's so many so many opportunities for antics. Yeah
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.620]  All right, anything else you want to talk about this week?
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:51.060]  You know what no, yeah, I feel like we've covered we've covered good things
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:58.420]  Oh, I actually I saw speaking of Star Wars to close it out on Star Wars. I I watched the force awakens
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:02.420]  the behind the scenes documentary that was included with the
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:08.080]  With the iTunes extras because of course force awakens is on DVD blu-ray iTunes, etc
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:11.580]  Everywhere in the US and I think the UK gets it later this week
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:14.260]  And that was really awesome
[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:17.080]  It's just a good good documentary overall
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:21.740]  But the highlight of it is they show they have a scene of like oh, you know
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:28.880]  Harrison Ford is entering our model of the Millennium Falcon for the first time and they they in the documentary
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:35.020]  They they clip or they cut between finished clips of the movie and then the behind the scenes of when this is all happening
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:40.300]  and there's just this really nice moment where you start on the the actual scene of
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:47.540]  Han like walking into the the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon and doing the the smile and the self-satisfied like we're finally here
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:51.760]  And then you cut to the behind the scenes and you see him out of frame
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.120]  He's pulled
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:58.980]  He's pulled two tiny little dice from his pocket and he hangs them up on one of the like higher
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:05.440]  Switches in the Millennium Falcon's cockpit. It's just like not big fuzzy dice like miniature versions of tiny fuzzy dice
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:12.020]  And he hangs them and he that he sits down and smiles and I'm just like this is that's that's the true heart of Star
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:13.300]  Wars right there. I
[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:20.460]  Heard that there were tiny little non fuzzy dice in the new. Hope I think yeah, I think that's I call back to that
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:26.340]  exactly, I think I think he's been carrying around those tiny fuzzy dice for like 40 years and just
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:28.300]  Brought it back
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:32.500]  All right. I have not watched it on home video yet. I've been saving it
[02:07:32.500 --> 02:07:35.060]  We still have a lot of contention in our household over
[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:38.140]  Over what happened? Oh
[02:07:38.900 --> 02:07:41.620]  Yeah, I I understand that that was very
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:47.400]  we watched it last night for for Rick's birthday, and it was definitely a
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.800]  It was definitely a contentious scene. Even the dogs don't like it. Oh
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:08:00.520]  Yeah, you did the thing where you watched with bb-8 too, right I did I did I watched I watched bits and pieces with the with
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:05.040]  It's it that's that droid gets so chatty. It's it's really funny to do it
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:09.260]  Not as a like I wouldn't suggest doing it if you really want to pay attention to the movie
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:12.400]  But if you want to get a kick and while having it on in the background
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:19.440]  bb-8 will talk pretty much non-stop about any scene that has him in it any scene that has Poe Dameron in it or
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:25.320]  Anytime the characters make what bb-8 thinks is a stupid decision. You'll hear no no, no
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:30.280]  No, and it and it'll shake his little head super cute. It's a pretty cool feature
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:34.160]  so anyway, the long story short is if you have that little bb-8 toy that you can drive with your
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:39.860]  With your iPhone if you watch the movie with that toy the bb-8
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:43.400]  It watches along with you and reacts. It's super cute
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:49.040]  You have to have the bb-8 in its base because a battery and you have to have your phone plugged in and the app open
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.160]  Which is like the dumb part, but still pretty fun. Yeah
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:55.080]  All right. Thank you serenity people can
