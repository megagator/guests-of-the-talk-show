[00:00.000 --> 00:03.800]  All right Adam before we get into the show proper I'm going to send you right now
[00:04.600 --> 00:10.840]  I'm going to send you a photograph. I took from my desk today. This was hours ago. You'll see it was daylight
[00:11.120 --> 00:13.760]  This was the view from my desk in my home office
[00:14.000 --> 00:21.140]  Okay, it it's at the back of our house. It overlooks a little courtyard in our our rear neighbors across the courtyard
[00:21.140 --> 00:36.980]  We're having some are are having some some home repairs done. Okay, it's going through through Skype. No, no, no
[00:36.980 --> 00:40.180]  I'm sending it as an eye message. Okay, keep it secure
[00:42.820 --> 00:46.280]  All right says that it's that there it is
[00:46.280 --> 00:52.520]  You know, I need you to realize that the the guy
[00:53.720 --> 00:55.720]  The top guy
[00:55.720 --> 00:57.720]  Is not that is not a
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.480]  A deck that is just a little sort of like a little ledge outside the show. Yeah
[01:05.160 --> 01:07.160]  Oh my god. What is he doing?
[01:07.960 --> 01:10.920]  It doesn't seem safe. It doesn't seem safe at all
[01:10.920 --> 01:18.480]  This is this is at least I don't know the third floor fourth floor. It's pretty high up and the other guy is on two letters
[01:18.480 --> 01:24.080]  He's traveling too loud. That's like a ripped pants Harold Lloyd gag in the making
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.840]  There is if you look it's hard to see because it's like the iPhone kind of focused on the screen in my window
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.520]  But if you look there is sort of like a blue rope. Yeah, go into the roof of the house
[01:36.520 --> 01:41.000]  But the rope is actually connected to the other ladder that isn't being used
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.200]  So it's like there's a ladder that has like a safety harness, but the guy doesn't have oh god
[01:49.640 --> 01:52.560]  Oh, these are some real real morons
[01:53.560 --> 01:56.540]  Oh, did you just stare for like an hour waiting for them to
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.280]  I had to close the window. I could not I couldn't get any work done my palms
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.520]  My palms my palms were sweating such that I could have cured the drought in California
[02:09.320 --> 02:12.280]  What were they doing? They're they're ripping up the
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.880]  Roof or something. I guess they're retiling the roof or something
[02:15.880 --> 02:18.120]  They're doing they're just doing work on the roof or whatever
[02:18.120 --> 02:20.120]  But the way that they are on these ladders
[02:20.680 --> 02:27.440]  Does not does not seem safe. No, it's not good. That's not OSHA standards. That's not to code
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.280]  The guy the one guy and he wasn't just straddling those two ladders for a second or two
[02:33.280 --> 02:34.320]  He
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.400]  Whatever he was doing up there was one foot on one ladder and one on another. I felt like I was watching a chaplain movie
[02:44.240 --> 02:46.240]  And my fear was I
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.360]  Was just feared for their lives and then apparently then then they started they got into an argument with apparently a rival contractor
[02:52.360 --> 02:59.200]  Who's doing? I what appears to be some other job on the same house, but there are they clearly not colleagues and
[03:00.040 --> 03:05.920]  And they got into an argument, but it's like the one group that's in the argument is 30 feet up in the air in a ladder
[03:05.920 --> 03:07.920]  I don't feel like that's the time to have an argument
[03:12.480 --> 03:16.120]  Yeah, they get into beefs those construction crews. They're
[03:17.600 --> 03:19.600]  It's very browy that culture
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.240]  We've had some work done on our house recently and
[03:25.320 --> 03:32.040]  If the crew doesn't like somebody on the you know, they'll do they'll do pranks. They'll do some fraternity shit
[03:35.640 --> 03:39.680]  For example, I don't know, you know like hiding the guy's keys
[03:39.680 --> 03:47.080]  For like hours, you know, not like and they're these are grown men. These are like men in their forties and fifties I
[03:49.520 --> 03:55.920]  I'm kind of glad that I don't work in an industry where it's it would be it's common place for people to hide your keys
[03:55.920 --> 03:59.120]  Excited I lose I lose my keys frequently enough on my own
[04:01.360 --> 04:03.360]  Yeah, that's just kind of permissible
[04:03.360 --> 04:10.520]  Adam so we talk about lots of stuff. We always talk about lots of stuff
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.480]  But I mean the big thing is Apple TV. So the last episode of this show I did it with Guy English
[04:17.040 --> 04:19.040]  was we were really just like
[04:19.760 --> 04:24.640]  I forget when we recorded Friday. Yeah, so I think we I definitely had it 24 hours and
[04:25.040 --> 04:30.720]  Guy had the dev kit one for a while, but it was really only hooked up like the dev kit thing really wasn't that useful
[04:30.720 --> 04:34.240]  Because the app store wasn't live in it or anything like that till Friday
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.040]  So in terms of like getting like a sense of the whole experience
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.040]  It was it was relatively new for both of us
[04:39.680 --> 04:42.240]  Right and and I've we've had another week
[04:43.200 --> 04:45.200]  Yeah, and I've been with it for about
[04:46.080 --> 04:48.080]  72 hours now
[04:48.480 --> 04:51.360]  So I've done my fair share of poking around
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.760]  Mostly part partially in prep for talking with you about I feel like that's I kind of have to go through the
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.640]  You know kick the tires and take it through it's run it through its paces right now
[05:02.640 --> 05:06.640]  I'm oh, I brought it into the office. I brought my Apple TV into the office
[05:06.640 --> 05:08.480]  And I have it hooked up to a TV here
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.960]  So I can go through all the UI as we talk about it and right now
[05:12.960 --> 05:14.960]  I'm doing like a little science experiment
[05:15.680 --> 05:17.680]  with the reflection
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.400]  As I you know in the in the in the in the icons
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.840]  What do you call the
[05:21.840 --> 05:27.040]  Refraction? I don't know what you call that well the the the reflection because there's a light source reflected
[05:27.040 --> 05:29.360]  right in the in the in the pain and
[05:30.000 --> 05:36.640]  It's striking me and I'm and I'm using a different reflective surface and that I got I'm using the reflective part of
[05:37.120 --> 05:42.560]  The of the remote of the real remote because I want to make sure okay. Yeah, it does it
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.600]  It didn't it like the way that when you turn the pain to the left or the right that the reflection
[05:50.640 --> 05:52.640]  goes off
[05:52.640 --> 05:54.160]  To you know
[05:54.160 --> 05:58.000]  It goes off to the left or the right the the way it would in the real world
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.400]  Obviously to mimic the physical universe
[06:00.880 --> 06:06.800]  You mean like when you just sort of jiggle your thumb on the touch pad a little bit just to make the currently selected item sort of
[06:07.840 --> 06:08.880]  Rotate around
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.360]  Exactly. Yeah, I get pivots it pivots slightly
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.880]  That's right. It pivots and it also sort of pans over. It's like really cool. Like however they rigged this
[06:17.440 --> 06:19.440]  It's almost like on a ball joint
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.160]  Yeah, that's a good way to put it right
[06:22.160 --> 06:25.440]  So like as if it's like sitting on a bowling ball and
[06:26.240 --> 06:32.720]  You push it back and forth and it reflects the light source behind you, which is sort of a soft light bank
[06:34.400 --> 06:40.000]  God that they're just getting really good at this stuff, you know mimicking the the physical universe
[06:40.240 --> 06:45.520]  In a way that of course it makes sense. We kind of had to like pull it back and go flat for a while
[06:46.560 --> 06:48.560]  while they got better
[06:48.560 --> 06:55.120]  at doing this kind of stuff this kind of visual effect kind of stuff because before you know you look at like aqua and
[06:55.920 --> 06:57.520]  it looked
[06:57.520 --> 06:59.520]  Kind of cool for the time, but it looked like
[07:00.080 --> 07:03.440]  You know relative to the physical world. It looked like garbage. It was dumb
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.360]  But this doesn't look dumb. I don't think no. I like it a lot
[07:08.560 --> 07:10.240]  I do like the way it looks
[07:10.240 --> 07:17.360]  But it's the feel of it that I really like and if there's anything that I feel is just I and I've read a lot more other people's
[07:17.360 --> 07:22.240]  Reviews of it since you know since I spoke about it in the last show and
[07:22.880 --> 07:28.440]  It does seem mixed. It seems like it to me a lot of people are it seems like I'm into minority
[07:28.440 --> 07:32.240]  It seems like a lot of the overall first-week feedback is a
[07:32.800 --> 07:39.840]  Lot more negative than I think it should be yeah, it's like way way more controversial than you would ever think it would be that it seems like a
[07:40.800 --> 07:46.880]  Minority that's that's actually just really like stoked about this thing. Yeah, definitely on your side
[07:46.880 --> 07:49.680]  I I think this is magical and I've been a
[07:50.240 --> 07:54.440]  Apple TV huge proponent of Apple TV since the first version
[07:55.480 --> 07:58.120]  So I've watched it, you know, I've owned a
[07:58.920 --> 08:00.920]  bunch of them I like
[08:00.920 --> 08:04.400]  For I've owned a I've owned oh, yeah, definitely a Vondall 4 and like
[08:05.600 --> 08:07.440]  one you know kind of to the point of
[08:07.440 --> 08:15.200]  Of a fixation where I like I would get one free they're cheap enough now you can get one for each TV
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.840]  And like you know we have to TV, you know two in the office and
[08:20.240 --> 08:22.240]  Or actually four in the office
[08:22.800 --> 08:30.600]  But Jesse Charlie reminded me today on Twitter that I was the guy who would when when the Apple TV first came out version one
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.120]  I would actually travel with it like if we were at all, you know come to to a conference
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.000]  We'd come to a conference in San Francisco
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.400]  And I would bring mine with me and hook it up to the hotel TV just in case
[08:43.400 --> 08:50.000]  And I kept my whole movie library on there because it wasn't nothing there was no real cloud service kind of stuff yet
[08:51.120 --> 08:53.320]  But I would I hacked mine
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.760]  Back then you used this what was it fire something?
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.240]  Do you remember what it was what was it was it not fire wire? No, there's um
[09:02.240 --> 09:09.560]  There's a there's a there's a company a software company that basically sold a hack for the Apple TV. Oh
[09:10.560 --> 09:13.560]  I know what you mean. I forget what it was called
[09:15.080 --> 09:17.080]  This is why we should have a live audience
[09:18.480 --> 09:25.480]  I know what you mean now and and the fact was really I would just say going back zoom out to the big you know big picture
[09:25.480 --> 09:27.480]  There's really only been three
[09:27.480 --> 09:33.480]  Apple TVs the first one which ran like it was like Mac OS X 10 10.4
[09:34.040 --> 09:36.200]  Under the hood it what didn't look like a Mac
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.440]  But if you took it apart and did the equivalent of jail breaking it you could figure out it was a an Intel
[09:42.360 --> 09:48.800]  x86 Mac more or less like a really low-end Mac mini running a version of OS X
[09:50.320 --> 09:52.720]  But with this custom TV interface
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.800]  And sometimes if something went wrong you had to surface like the
[09:57.600 --> 10:05.080]  The BDO S or whatever you could see yeah, yeah, you could you could see all the code running on it
[10:05.080 --> 10:07.600]  And it felt real main frame me in a weird way
[10:07.600 --> 10:11.840]  Then there's the second generation which is when they switched to a much smaller puck
[10:12.120 --> 10:19.480]  The little black puck and it was much simpler and it was under the hood running it was running a version of iOS
[10:19.480 --> 10:25.000]  The third generation is really sort of like 2.5 because it was just like I
[10:26.320 --> 10:33.080]  Forget what it added, but it it maybe that was when they added 1080p support. I forget but it was that that is true
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.880]  Yeah, I was 1080p and for some reason because I have both versions in the home in my in my home right now
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.200]  For some reason version two no longer runs YouTube
[10:42.520 --> 10:45.840]  Yeah, exactly no that I know why that is it long story short
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.680]  It's because at some point Apple stopped doing software updates for that second-generation one and
[10:51.680 --> 10:57.200]  YouTube like sometime within the last six months YouTube changed their
[10:58.200 --> 10:59.880]  API at
[10:59.880 --> 11:07.440]  To such that anything that hooked up to you poo YouTube needed some sort of update to keep active with YouTube and because the second-generation
[11:08.840 --> 11:12.500]  Apple TV isn't getting software updates anymore. It can't use YouTube
[11:13.240 --> 11:14.840]  right and so
[11:14.840 --> 11:21.720]  The second generation is still rolling running the old iOS, which is a awkward and and nasty and then
[11:22.200 --> 11:24.200]  version three iOS
[11:24.880 --> 11:27.720]  Looks pretty good, but nothing compared to this one
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.760]  But I I looked it up. It's called fire well now. It's called fire core that hack that that
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.840]  That hack that you could install and it back then it was called a TV flash
[11:37.440 --> 11:39.080]  ATV flash
[11:39.080 --> 11:45.120]  Yeah, you would buy this software you would use a USB stick to flash your Apple TV and
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.360]  Override the OS somehow and then you could do things like you know mount it
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.440]  On your Mac as an external hard drive copy your movie library onto there
[11:56.840 --> 12:03.880]  And I don't even remember how big the hard drive was but it was enough that I could you know and if you had like a bunch of standard deaf movies
[12:03.880 --> 12:05.680]  You could you could store them on there
[12:05.680 --> 12:12.280]  You could also like hook up an external drive and so really that was my oh, you could all you could you can install other apps like Plex
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.800]  I forget what else, but you know like those Xbox media center kind of media players
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.080]  Yeah, and really like that's the only I never jelbrooke my iPhone
[12:23.080 --> 12:25.080]  But I totally jelbrooke the
[12:25.320 --> 12:28.520]  Apple TV just so I could like do more stuff with it
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.480]  Well, so the original name was ATV flash and what's the new name fire fire core?
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.600]  The fire core fire core. Okay. I don't know what it does now because there's really no need for it
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.480]  Yeah, the first Apple TV. I mean this was I mean that was really I mean and you know
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.600]  That was really when it was a quote-unquote hobby for Apple
[12:49.600 --> 12:51.880]  But the basic idea with the first Apple TV again
[12:51.880 --> 13:00.520]  It wasn't like a Mac mini under the hood it had a spinning hard disk and more or less as I recall unless I'm forgetting something
[13:00.520 --> 13:06.880]  pretty much all it really was good for was watching movies that you had downloaded to the Apple TV somehow
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.480]  Like either from your I either from your iTunes on your computer
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.760]  You could like play a movie that you had downloaded or if you got or like rented or bought a movie from iTunes
[13:18.360 --> 13:22.160]  On your Apple TV you had to wait for the whole thing to download and then it would play
[13:22.840 --> 13:27.720]  Maybe it would start before finish, but you were still downloading it and it was like taking up space on a hard drive
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.640]  Exactly and in hindsight it makes total sense why they would call that a hobby because it didn't work that well
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.760]  It wasn't a good experience, you know consumer experience. There was no airplay
[13:39.320 --> 13:41.320]  there was
[13:41.320 --> 13:46.520]  There was very little you needed it to have a big hard drive just so you could like store the movies that you bought because they
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.120]  You weren't getting them any any other way. Yeah, and I think you know, and it's it was a you know
[13:52.120 --> 13:54.120]  It I think we forget how much
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.920]  It's at home bandwidth has improved in the last eight nine years
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.360]  Chis 2007 that first one came out that does it seems like a lot longer ago than that
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.960]  Yeah, and I think you know you go back in time to 2007 and you know run a speed test
[14:09.960 --> 14:13.320]  You probably have a lot most people would probably have a lot slower connection at home
[14:13.320 --> 14:19.160]  I remember I used to be a freak a common problem with that where you would get like ready to
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.960]  I do remember now that it definitely played before it completely downloaded a movie
[14:23.960 --> 14:30.040]  But it would give you like a ready to play and like for me like the best you ever got would be like ready to play in
[14:30.440 --> 14:31.880]  two minutes
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.040]  And you'd wait two minutes and you know, maybe go to the bathroom before the movie started
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.320]  Maybe go mix it drink or something like that
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.760]  And then it would go but then sometimes you would get it and be like ready to play 30 minutes
[14:43.160 --> 14:45.160]  Spin spin spin
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.440]  Or the work 31 minute you were if you had a bandwidth problem going on
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.640]  Ready to and you've got the popcorn popped and everything and then it's like ready to play 17 hours
[14:56.280 --> 14:58.280]  17 hours 43 minute
[14:59.960 --> 15:07.960]  As a part one as a as a modern dad that really it just it really felt like it really felt like I was just letting my family down
[15:08.920 --> 15:14.360]  Right, but you know you could always go to the blockbuster video and rent the DVD in the same amount of time
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.520]  Right like in the Norman Rockwell America where your dad is the guy who could like fix the chain on your bike
[15:20.520 --> 15:23.000]  You know like you bust the chain on your bike and your dad
[15:23.080 --> 15:30.320]  You know it would have like a bench is basement or the garage where you could like do whatever it takes to fix a busted bike chain
[15:30.440 --> 15:35.680]  Like my version of that is you know a large part of it involves
[15:35.680 --> 15:38.720]  You know ones and zeros and connecting the shirt and making them work
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.280]  And then you promise your family, you know like hey, let's watch the new Pixar and everybody's excited and like you said
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.200]  The popcorn's popped and it says ready to play in 17 hours and it just never goes on well
[15:50.200 --> 15:52.440]  And I know there are still times today
[15:52.440 --> 15:54.480]  I know that I don't know about what the new Apple TV
[15:54.480 --> 15:57.280]  I've never had a problem like that yet in a week that I've had the new Apple TV
[15:57.280 --> 16:03.760]  But I know that there are times where even with like the third generation Apple TV that just got superseded last week
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.040]  That people would get problems like that or just get a spinner that never stops
[16:08.040 --> 16:13.640]  You know, you'd for whatever reason. Yeah, those edge cases those edge cases where
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.360]  You wouldn't know what to do like where the Apple TV wouldn't know what to do just because something went wrong
[16:19.600 --> 16:22.000]  But it did not I like correct itself quickly
[16:22.000 --> 16:27.920]  I like like if you like iTunes can't download this purchase that kind of that that kind of error message that it wasn't really clear
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.680]  What the hell happened except that the thing that you bought won't won't play on your thing
[16:33.600 --> 16:35.600]  but yeah, there's no there's no
[16:35.600 --> 16:44.120]  Better example of what it what it of that domestic kind of uncomfortableness that happens when you and your
[16:44.760 --> 16:49.000]  You know your domestic partner your spouse are sitting down and
[16:50.280 --> 16:53.560]  She or he can't understand why you're so why why?
[16:54.120 --> 17:00.320]  A why you can't fix this thing because I'll she wants to do is watch a movie, but also
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.920]  Why you're spending so much time sweating it because like this is the future
[17:05.360 --> 17:09.200]  The thing that this thing that we hooked up to our computer is the future
[17:10.200 --> 17:16.640]  And just like give it time just be patient and she's like there's a VCR sitting right there like right there
[17:16.640 --> 17:18.640]  We've got a copy of Beetlejuice
[17:18.640 --> 17:20.640]  Ready to go
[17:20.640 --> 17:26.880]  When we used to watch them on disks DVDs or blue rays or even going even going back to the tapes
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.960]  Were the worst thing you could have with the tape is you'd have to wait for it to rewind even going back to that era
[17:31.960 --> 17:39.040]  At least once you know the worst case scenario is that you maybe maybe your DVDs and the shelf in the living room aren't
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.280]  Alpha-petized, you know, and it might take a minute or two like ever have that problem where it's like where the hell is the movie
[17:45.280 --> 17:46.280]  We're sure
[17:46.280 --> 17:53.760]  Yeah, because they're very thin boxes and we I mean sometimes a DV DVD scratches and it won't and it skips and it won't play
[17:54.840 --> 17:56.280]  VHS
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.320]  You take it out of the deck and you put it in your little thing like your little car rewinder
[18:02.360 --> 18:05.720]  You know, you little rewind VHS rewinder that's shaped like a car
[18:06.360 --> 18:13.360]  Wait for it. Maybe like two minutes to rewind. It seems like I guess the more complicated technology gets this is a real
[18:14.960 --> 18:16.960]  Armabombic observation
[18:17.760 --> 18:21.760]  The more complicated technology gets more of a pain in the ass it is
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.600]  It doesn't go over well when you get the you get the 17 hours until it's ready to play
[18:27.880 --> 18:33.120]  But not only that but my specialty was like a V stuff like I was a V guy in the family and
[18:33.880 --> 18:40.120]  Would always have every cable for everything and if my dad couldn't figure out I'd get the damn receiver to go to the
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.600]  DVD player then I would just like print out instructions and stuff but when it's in software
[18:45.600 --> 18:53.840]  It unless you're like a real smart person. You can't figure it out. There's no troubleshooting it. Yeah. He's got to hit the thing
[18:55.480 --> 18:58.560]  But it's this one seems pretty rock solid though
[19:00.320 --> 19:04.720]  The new app for me. Yeah, performance. I have I've had a couple of crashes that
[19:05.280 --> 19:07.640]  Not not system crashes, but out crashes
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.200]  The worst thing I've seen so far is that I've had a couple of times where
[19:12.200 --> 19:19.840]  It's like I turn my TV back on and this is not Apple TV's fault or at least it can't because my TV is sold
[19:20.160 --> 19:24.200]  That it doesn't have the it's called HDMI
[19:24.720 --> 19:26.720]  Dash CEC
[19:26.720 --> 19:33.040]  Which is the the way that if if your device is all speak see the HDMI CEC
[19:33.320 --> 19:37.240]  They can turn each other on and off and they can do things like
[19:38.240 --> 19:40.240]  change the HDMI input so
[19:40.240 --> 19:47.280]  And if with an ideal TV set in theory, you can just turn on your Apple TV and it will also turn on your TV
[19:47.280 --> 19:53.520]  And will switch the input on your TV to the Apple TV input so you just do one you know hit one button and it all goes on
[19:54.360 --> 19:57.920]  I don't have it my TV does isn't even supposed to do that
[19:58.760 --> 20:05.440]  So I have to turn a TV on first and then switch the input on the TV remote and then turn on the Apple TV or or vice versa
[20:05.440 --> 20:10.680]  But I've had twice so far in the last few days where the Apple TV turns on I see the little white light on it
[20:10.920 --> 20:15.400]  But it I don't have any I don't see anything on screen. It's just like black
[20:15.800 --> 20:23.240]  But it's also not like a no signal picture. It's it's just like still there. So what do you do you hit the menu button?
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.040]  What seems to fix it for me is switching to another HDMI this doesn't make any sense
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.960]  I don't even get how how this would fix it, but it seems like if I switch to another input on the TV
[20:36.080 --> 20:42.600]  Like to the TV and then go back to Apple TV and then hit menu or something or home. It'll it'll work
[20:42.600 --> 20:44.600]  But if I don't switch I
[20:45.240 --> 20:48.240]  Can just sit there and hit home or menu and it doesn't do anything
[20:48.360 --> 20:56.640]  Maybe and that seems like a placebo to me because switching the HDMI input on the TV shouldn't affect what the Apple TV is sending out at all
[20:56.640 --> 21:00.160]  Well, I think it just kind of rejiggers it a little bit
[21:01.160 --> 21:04.360]  I think that's what I if I'm right that it's not a placebo
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.040]  I do think that that's it that there's some kind of rejiggering like when you first switch
[21:09.040 --> 21:15.360]  I don't know anything about HDMI. I don't know how it works. Well, it is bi-directional right and so in other words
[21:15.360 --> 21:17.520]  I yeah, so the rejiggering might be like
[21:19.080 --> 21:25.760]  When I switch the TV's input to the TV and it's away from Apple TV it might tell the Apple TV
[21:25.760 --> 21:31.400]  Okay, I'm leaving and then when I switch back. It's like hey, I'm here again, and then it Apple TV somehow
[21:32.480 --> 21:35.600]  And I never had that problem with the old with my previous Apple TV
[21:35.600 --> 21:40.840]  And I can't help but think it's some kind of little silly bug and they will fix it and it's probably the type of bug
[21:40.840 --> 21:47.200]  That was easily slipped through because I'll bet that internally at Apple they weren't really testing on a lot of TV's is old as mine
[21:47.800 --> 21:52.520]  Right well, who knows I bet they have a warehouse full of every single TV
[21:52.520 --> 22:01.560]  In the last, you know, two decades since flat screens have have started been being made or since the HTML at HDMI standard came out
[22:01.560 --> 22:06.520]  I bet they breed it pretty they test them pretty extensively. They'd probably just don't put very much way to
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.520]  Wait into the making it work for perfectly well, and it doesn't happen every time and so I you know
[22:12.840 --> 22:19.880]  I'm not too concerned about it and it's you know once you're already I'm so used to the the little back and forth dance of
[22:19.880 --> 22:25.600]  I got to use like two or three different remotes turn on the sound turn on the TV turn the input on the TV turn on the thing
[22:25.640 --> 22:28.080]  But then once I have that set up then it once it's working
[22:28.080 --> 22:35.280]  I just use the Apple TV remote. I'm happy. Yeah, so we have a couple of these what we have a couple of these smart TVs at home
[22:37.080 --> 22:39.880]  And I heard you and you and Guy talking about this a little bit
[22:39.880 --> 22:42.600]  He said he has a TV with a Netflix app built into it. Yeah
[22:42.600 --> 22:47.320]  So Vizio makes season they're real cheap and they're smart TVs and they've got you know
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.120]  They've got most of the apps. They've got Netflix Hulu
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.560]  YouTube
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.360]  other ones Yahoo all of them the main
[22:56.080 --> 23:00.320]  streaming video apps and there's there's something so freeing about
[23:02.120 --> 23:08.040]  Like one of the TVs we have is 32 inches because it's just meant to go in like in the playroom basically
[23:08.120 --> 23:11.880]  There's something so freeing about unplugging it picking it up putting it somewhere else
[23:11.880 --> 23:18.760]  It's already on the Wi-Fi putting it down anywhere in the house and you just like launch the Netflix app and it'll play a video
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  without any other crap connected to it
[23:21.480 --> 23:22.920]  That's
[23:22.920 --> 23:26.200]  You know, that's like that that is the era of software in
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.760]  TV and I don't think most people have gotten to like really like really see that future all that much
[23:34.600 --> 23:37.720]  Just because we've the the development of
[23:37.720 --> 23:47.120]  Software in TV in this way that we're seeing an Apple TV has been really gone going on it's been going on concurrently
[23:48.080 --> 23:54.920]  Where smart where TVs themselves are getting smart, but also there's just every every hardware company out there is making its own
[23:55.080 --> 23:57.080]  Little box that you're supposed to plug in
[23:57.360 --> 24:01.320]  So it's really too row to roads at the same time and
[24:02.200 --> 24:05.160]  It's a matter of who's kind of getting there first and I
[24:05.160 --> 24:07.160]  For my money
[24:07.720 --> 24:11.720]  You know the Apple TV model is really really smart
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.520]  elegant, you know
[24:14.520 --> 24:16.520]  Box that holds everything is
[24:17.400 --> 24:19.720]  Probably the way that I would go instead of
[24:20.520 --> 24:24.040]  You know the other model, which is them making their own screen or whatever it is
[24:25.640 --> 24:30.600]  Did you see that I linked to I think the other Dan Daring fireball written by Abdell E-Bream?
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.720]  Yeah, I read that he's got his own blog. I've but he wrote this one at medium and more or less
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.240]  He's he's saying and this is after you know
[24:39.240 --> 24:45.160]  I get he got his hands on the new Apple TV that he still thinks Apple is gonna build a TV set with Apple TV built in
[24:45.160 --> 24:51.400]  You know sort of the the white whale of Apple TV sure sure and I do see I you know
[24:51.400 --> 24:56.360]  You can't help it see the appeal of that a little bit like even going back
[24:56.360 --> 25:03.240]  To my childhood. I mean it was probably before you were born. You're a youngster, but like when we first got
[25:03.880 --> 25:06.520]  our Atari 2600 and
[25:07.720 --> 25:14.040]  You'd hook it up to the TV like on that it was like the coaxial in I guess and our maybe it wasn't even coaxial
[25:14.040 --> 25:19.000]  No, it wasn't it was there was like this you screw them in you screw them in the little pins
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.840]  Yeah, like two little prongs like two little prongs and you'd screw them in
[25:22.840 --> 25:30.600]  Yeah, it was like to hook up your Atari 2600. You were like you were like a screwdriver. You're just gonna shock
[25:32.520 --> 25:34.760]  But there was also and I still to this day
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.600]  This is probably something I should look up because I've been curious about it since I was like seven
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.360]  Is you had the option between doing it on channel two or channel three and I was three or four was a three or four
[25:44.360 --> 25:48.440]  Whatever it was it was two of the lower channels, and I don't know why that was an option
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.240]  I there must have been some kind of case where where you did this
[25:53.240 --> 25:54.600]  Frequency interference. Yeah
[25:54.600 --> 26:00.600]  That like if you were got like a real strong signal from your local channel three station that channel four would be better for Atari or something
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.520]  Right or your microwave was on channel three. So you had to put your Atari on a channel four
[26:05.400 --> 26:08.840]  Yeah, something stupid like that, you know, just oh god analog
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.520]  The analog video world could not have gone away sooner as far as I'm concerned
[26:14.520 --> 26:20.440]  But even even that little once you had the thing hooked up and there was the two three thing and and I don't know
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.000]  Sometimes it would I don't even know why like maybe somebody would accidentally flip that switch because they thought they were
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.000]  Flipping the difficulty switch on the Atari and then you'd be like
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.640]  Your tarry you wouldn't it wouldn't come on. It would just be static and you'd be like turn to dial
[26:33.640 --> 26:38.440]  You know you turn to dial for and it's like anything like that is such it just seat feels
[26:39.640 --> 26:43.240]  Irritating it just feels like
[26:43.240 --> 26:47.080]  We're still in a race to get back to the simplicity of
[26:48.440 --> 26:55.160]  TV before there was anything you could ever plug into your TV where it was just a box that you turned on and there was a dial that had
[26:55.960 --> 26:57.960]  You know 14
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.600]  14 things on it, right? It was like two through 13 and UHF whatever that was
[27:03.240 --> 27:05.240]  and that was it
[27:05.240 --> 27:08.280]  You yes, you'd turn to dial to one of those 14 things and
[27:09.720 --> 27:12.120]  You could turn the thing on or off and that was it
[27:12.120 --> 27:17.240]  And there's a and there were there were four companies that are three companies out there
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.280]  Making everything that you could possibly need to watch. Well everything that you really wanted to watch
[27:22.920 --> 27:26.120]  Right all of the prime time stuff came from three different companies
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.720]  ABC NBC CBS. I don't know what they had around the world, but in the US that's what we had and we liked it
[27:34.360 --> 27:36.920]  Now obviously, you know, we don't want to go back to that
[27:36.920 --> 27:42.520]  But I feel like we we've spent 30 years trying to get back to that level of simplicity
[27:44.680 --> 27:51.080]  Absolutely, and I think where we're where we're getting there is this the the intelligence of discovery like the
[27:52.600 --> 27:56.760]  How software makes it so much easier even though there's literally exponentially
[27:59.640 --> 28:04.680]  Proud, you know thousands to hundreds of thousands of times more content out there
[28:04.680 --> 28:07.400]  Always available for us
[28:08.520 --> 28:13.400]  Then then and there used to be with just the three channel the foot, you know 14 channels
[28:14.680 --> 28:17.080]  The software is what made has made it available
[28:18.280 --> 28:20.680]  Has made it so that we could filter and find
[28:21.560 --> 28:26.680]  The equivalent of those three channels of stuff that we really want to watch at any given time at least that's
[28:27.240 --> 28:29.560]  The that's the theory right and it's
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.880]  It just can get confusing like I've been listening and I listened to some podcasts this week where people were talking about Apple TV and
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.200]  Like Jason Snell was saying that you know for years now
[28:40.200 --> 28:43.720]  Or at least the last few years he'd spent more his family spent more their time
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.280]  When they watch Netflix doing it through the t-vote and doing it through Apple TV and
[28:49.160 --> 28:54.920]  Like Netflix is the perfect example because Netflix really is everywhere. It's on any device that will take them
[28:54.920 --> 28:59.880]  And so I had a I first saw it on a Wii
[29:00.840 --> 29:02.840]  Yeah, I didn't even have a streaming
[29:03.400 --> 29:09.560]  I think Roku was maybe the first streaming box that got Netflix, but there you could you could get the disk for
[29:10.200 --> 29:12.200]  For the Wii and
[29:12.280 --> 29:17.960]  Launch that app from the disk and it would let you browse the Netflix streaming content and it was like it was miraculous
[29:19.000 --> 29:22.760]  It was even kind of better than the other like the Netflix
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.760]  Experience in the browser
[29:26.760 --> 29:30.040]  It's it's a but it's like there's so there's so many ways to do it
[29:30.040 --> 29:34.520]  You know I mean like you so you could use your t-vote. You could use your Wii. You could use your PlayStation
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.000]  I guess there's one for Xbox. I don't know. I don't have an Xbox, but sure
[29:41.560 --> 29:47.960]  Some of your TVs like we were just saying some of your TVs have Netflix built right in so you don't even need to have a box connected
[29:47.960 --> 29:53.960]  Or you could use your Apple TV or you could use the app on your phone or whatever and just
[29:54.760 --> 29:57.560]  You know airplane over to your Apple TV or something like that
[29:57.960 --> 30:04.280]  Mm-hmm, and it's all essentially just code. It's just right code that will do that's whose only purpose is to deliver you
[30:05.160 --> 30:13.240]  All that media that Netflix has available right but what I can see is I can kind of and that this is to me is gets to the heart of what
[30:13.240 --> 30:20.040]  I I feel like people miss I can kind of see how this new Apple TV could be the only thing on your TV
[30:21.480 --> 30:26.920]  Absolutely, that's what I would that's what I would like. I mean as soon as it can get me every single piece of TV content
[30:26.920 --> 30:31.080]  I could conceivably need. I do not want to switch to input too
[30:34.600 --> 30:36.600]  I
[30:36.600 --> 30:41.960]  And really like I used to think that Apple was gonna make a TV. I would agree with
[30:41.960 --> 30:44.280]  With Apple's assessment
[30:45.160 --> 30:47.160]  Like maybe a year or two ago
[30:47.880 --> 30:51.160]  I don't think it makes sense for them to do it anymore because
[30:52.440 --> 30:58.280]  They're able to iterate on this this box so much faster than people want to buy a new screen. I
[30:59.160 --> 31:01.160]  That's personally
[31:01.160 --> 31:05.560]  And I think you know and we've talked I've I think this is probably like that
[31:05.560 --> 31:12.840]  That knows you the most evergreen topic in the history of talking about Apple stuff because it's I mean
[31:12.840 --> 31:19.160]  We've been talking about this forever. I mean Dan Benjamin and I used to talk about this. I mean, and I was that was like 20 years ago, right?
[31:20.200 --> 31:22.200]  It was a long time ago
[31:23.000 --> 31:27.880]  And it you know like my old my old thinking will of course they'll do it is you know
[31:27.880 --> 31:35.880]  Why sell a hundred dollar box for a $2,000 TV instead of selling a $2,000 TV or for Apple at
[31:36.280 --> 31:37.880]  $3,000 TV
[31:37.880 --> 31:45.080]  And in the years since that basic thinking the average cost of a big flat screen modern TV is dropped away
[31:45.080 --> 31:48.760]  Well, you know, they're not $2,000 anymore. I mean you can buy one for two thousand
[31:48.760 --> 31:51.800]  But most people don't most people get them for just a couple hundred bucks
[31:51.800 --> 31:57.720]  So there's not that much more money there and maybe at some point they get to an equilibrium where the cost of the screen comes down
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.000]  So low
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.840]  Maybe to the to the point where it's the same cost as an iPhone and then the rest of it
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.280]  The cost is subsidized by all the media that you're going to buy right through it anyway
[32:08.520 --> 32:13.480]  Right and the other thing that in the makes me and I'm I linked to it and I'm optimistic because I'd still
[32:13.480 --> 32:17.240]  I'd like to kind of see it and I would like to buy it. It wouldn't matter what it cost
[32:17.240 --> 32:19.240]  I would like to buy the Apple branded TV
[32:22.120 --> 32:24.120]  I don't think that they'll make it though because
[32:24.120 --> 32:29.720]  I I feel like they would still have to make the box and keep it up to date because
[32:30.280 --> 32:33.560]  So many people have a TV that they don't want to pay to replace
[32:33.960 --> 32:36.760]  Yeah, because it's you know, they've just bought it in the last few years
[32:36.840 --> 32:40.840]  It's you know good enough and as much as the people like us who
[32:41.480 --> 32:45.160]  Obsessed about this and would just go if somebody said here's the Apple TV
[32:45.240 --> 32:47.640]  We're not going to even tell you the specs on it. Do you want to buy it or not?
[32:47.640 --> 32:49.640]  I of course I would just buy it
[32:49.640 --> 32:56.040]  Right, but we're not normal normal people and and it gets lost because people normal people do upgrade their phones a lot
[32:56.440 --> 33:02.840]  It's just the way that it is phones take a beating. They they you know a lot of totally normal non nerd people
[33:03.400 --> 33:08.120]  Upgrade their phone every two years and it every three years the the numbers even bigger
[33:08.760 --> 33:12.360]  Um people aren't like that with things like TVs and you know
[33:12.360 --> 33:18.440]  We might do it just because it's Apple but normal people wouldn't so it wouldn't wouldn't make sense to say the only way to get the current
[33:18.440 --> 33:22.600]  Apple TV and or fit, you know experience is to buy the entire Apple TV
[33:23.400 --> 33:24.200]  TV set
[33:24.200 --> 33:27.240]  So they still have to make the box and if they're still going to make the box
[33:27.640 --> 33:31.080]  Why not just make the box and just have that be it and hook it up to everybody's TV?
[33:31.560 --> 33:36.760]  Yeah, I think that's the way it's gonna it's gonna shake it shake out and there's a couple of other reasons
[33:36.920 --> 33:39.240]  I believe that now too and actually
[33:40.440 --> 33:45.080]  It's funny. I notice this phenomenon because you know when we shoot
[33:45.080 --> 33:51.720]  Commercials in locations a lot and like in people's real homes and a lot of the times we're looking for rich people homes
[33:52.440 --> 33:58.600]  And around LA a lot of people a lot of rich people will rent out their homes for locations and you can always see
[33:59.320 --> 34:01.320]  You can walk into a home
[34:02.200 --> 34:09.240]  Of any era and see when the owners made their money because you can tell when their TVs were installed like when their flash screens were
[34:09.720 --> 34:11.720]  purchased and installed
[34:11.720 --> 34:15.800]  On their walls because people don't replace their TVs that that often
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.880]  So a lot of times it's very common is go walk into like a two three million dollar house and all the flat screens are from
[34:22.600 --> 34:24.600]  You know 2006 or something
[34:25.160 --> 34:27.720]  With like super huge bevel, you know
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.120]  Edges on the you know flat screens didn't start getting attractive until very recently
[34:34.280 --> 34:37.880]  And that's the other reason that I don't think Apple needs to make a TV is because
[34:37.880 --> 34:45.720]  You know like I'm a big fan of Vizio TV's Vizio makes the bezel so small that you can barely see it
[34:45.720 --> 34:51.080]  And if it's any smaller, it's just a piece of glass and if Apple makes a piece of glass and I'll buy that but otherwise
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.720]  I'm fine. I don't need you know, I don't need to analyze aluminum or anything. Yeah, I've seen that too
[34:58.680 --> 35:03.160]  Looking at houses like a couple months ago. We were looking at maybe thinking about a
[35:03.640 --> 35:05.800]  Movement here and the place we looked at had
[35:05.800 --> 35:11.960]  It was a beautiful house overall didn't really work for us, but overall it was a beautiful house
[35:13.160 --> 35:15.160]  Almost more like
[35:15.160 --> 35:17.720]  So beautiful like beautiful for like taking
[35:18.360 --> 35:23.560]  Pictures of the house as opposed to actually living there sure as well. It had this big
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.160]  Living room kitchen sort of combination room with double-height ceilings
[35:29.400 --> 35:32.360]  It was more like a lobby than like a room
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.640]  It almost was like the look more like the lobby to like a boutique like a really boutique small hotel
[35:38.200 --> 35:45.240]  And they had a beautiful fireplace in the fireplace all the way from the ground to the ceiling above it was
[35:46.280 --> 35:48.280]  Like rocks set
[35:48.600 --> 35:51.240]  Together not quite bricks because they were like irregular
[35:51.240 --> 35:57.880]  But they did all the work of finding rocks that perfectly fit together to form a column going up to the ceiling and then set into
[35:57.880 --> 36:05.720]  The rocks above the fireplace was spaced to install your flat screen TV. Yeah, and it was like it was like maybe like 46 inches
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.560]  The I think right yeah, and that's what they had they had like a 46 inch TV in there
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.960]  And you know, we're in there as a family looking at this house and I just looked at Jonas and Jonas looked at me and he just
[36:17.960 --> 36:27.400]  Okay, he's disappointed right a bit like but also like they literally set the maximum size of a TV you could have in this room
[36:27.960 --> 36:33.560]  In stone. Yeah, oh, they literally set it in stone. Well, you can take the TV out
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.280]  But then the only logical place to put a TV in this room was there
[36:39.080 --> 36:44.840]  I mean you could put one and you can put a TV anywhere, but you know like there's certain rooms like a living room type thing where you go in and that's like
[36:44.840 --> 36:51.560]  You can just tell if we're gonna put a TV in this room the TV is gonna go there because it doesn't really you know for symmetry reasons or
[36:51.960 --> 36:53.000]  Other layout reasons
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.200]  The only real place to put it would be on the wall above the fireplace and it was set into the stone
[36:58.280 --> 37:03.080]  There was like a cutout where you would put your flat screen TV and I would say the maximum TV that would fit in there
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.280]  Was like maybe maybe 46 maybe even a little smaller. All right. Oh, that's a shame
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.120]  So you could just find you could just find out you could again like you said
[37:10.120 --> 37:12.440]  I bet I don't know what time what year the house was built
[37:12.440 --> 37:19.280]  But I'm sure you could figure it out by finding out what year a 46-inch TV was like the best model you could preview a model
[37:20.320 --> 37:23.920]  When that was the that was the model that costs like $5,000
[37:24.400 --> 37:26.960]  Exactly. That's what rich people will spend on a TV
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.080]  But and in the last point and you alluded to this, but I think I think it definitely bears repeating is
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.840]  If Apple sold it, let's say a $2,000 TV set it would be so awesome for a year and then 12 months later
[37:40.840 --> 37:46.720]  It's it would ever a 10 or a 11 whatever year your imagining Apple comes out with this
[37:46.720 --> 37:50.720]  It's a 10 system on a chip is all of a sudden outdated and
[37:51.400 --> 37:58.920]  Nobody is going to buy a new TV set every year people might buy a new Apple TV box that costs a hundred dollars every year
[37:59.120 --> 38:02.280]  Or every other year maybe just to keep up with you know
[38:02.440 --> 38:05.400]  We'll move the old one to the living room put a new one in it, you know
[38:05.400 --> 38:07.760]  Or old one to the bedroom and put a new one in the living room
[38:07.760 --> 38:15.240]  No one's gonna do that with actual TV sets. No, and I do feel I feel like there are tremendous advantages that Apple is going to bring to bear
[38:15.440 --> 38:22.480]  On this market and when it comes to games and stuff like that by having these a series chips that gets so much faster year over year
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.680]  And that only makes sense if Apple TV is a box not an actual TV set
[38:28.520 --> 38:32.240]  Yeah, and it's gonna be a while before this the actual screens themselves
[38:32.240 --> 38:38.000]  Have such a leap in technology that only one company is doing it and you have to go with that company
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.720]  Right something like stare, you know stereo without glasses or something like that otherwise higher resolution
[38:44.280 --> 38:47.680]  Fine, you know 4k TV. You can't really tell a difference
[38:48.680 --> 38:51.560]  From you know a certain distance away from it
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.480]  So the other ones are really are really good and they're very cost effective you can get
[38:56.480 --> 39:05.160]  It's just a really really good, you know 50 60 inch TV for four three four five hundred dollars. That's crazy
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.960]  Well, it's my mind. All right, hold on thought. I'd remind me when I'm gonna take a break here and thank a sponsor
[39:09.960 --> 39:13.560]  I want to talk about 4k when we got an owl forget
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.320]  But you were it's funny coincidence
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.480]  You were saying wouldn't it be great if Apple just made a TV that was a piece of glass without a frame well
[39:20.480 --> 39:22.160]  Guess what it doesn't play TV
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.360]  But our first sponsors fracture do that for your still photography
[39:28.520 --> 39:34.640]  You guys know fracture. They have sponsored this show for a long time now on a frequent basis. They're the company you send them
[39:35.080 --> 39:36.240]  You go to their website
[39:36.240 --> 39:41.040]  You give them your still photos and you pick a size and then they print them on the back
[39:41.200 --> 39:42.600]  Right on a piece of glass
[39:42.600 --> 39:44.480]  They just print the photo right on this glass
[39:44.480 --> 39:50.640]  And then they mail it to you in a really cool little package and then you hang this thing hang these pictures up all over your house
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.840]  And they're beautiful and they're really high-quality prints. It's not a piece of paper stuck to the glass
[39:55.840 --> 40:00.200]  It's not a frame. It's a piece of glass or and then they have some kind of
[40:01.480 --> 40:07.840]  proprietary technology they call it the factory down in beautiful Gainesville, Florida where they they print these things
[40:09.360 --> 40:13.720]  So great so convenient so beautiful. No border. You don't need a frame around this
[40:13.720 --> 40:19.800]  You don't need to put it in a frame. There is no frame around just a piece of glass border to border with your pictures on it
[40:19.800 --> 40:26.520]  Now they want to thank all of you. They want me to thank all of you. The reason they keep sponsoring our show is that
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.040]  You guys keep buying these these pictures from them. I don't blame you. They're great
[40:31.560 --> 40:34.320]  We buy them too. They want to thank you for your support
[40:35.040 --> 40:37.440]  But they want me to remind you that
[40:38.040 --> 40:43.280]  If you're gonna buy these as gifts for the holiday season and you should because these are
[40:43.920 --> 40:45.920]  just the best gifts if you've got
[40:45.920 --> 40:49.400]  kids or pets or something like that where you can just
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.560]  Give somebody in your life a picture of of you know people in your family great great gift really great
[40:56.640 --> 41:03.280]  They want you to go ahead. Just do it now take like half an hour find the best pictures you've taken in the last year
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.280]  And send them to fracture do it now in early November because
[41:09.080 --> 41:10.960]  They can you know they print these things fast
[41:10.960 --> 41:17.520]  But they fall behind in the holiday season because you know most of us procrastinate on buying our holiday gifts
[41:17.520 --> 41:21.360]  And they'll tell you when you go to the site whenever you're whatever day you're listening to this broadcast
[41:22.480 --> 41:25.080]  You can go there and they give you like an estimated
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.320]  Shipping date and if you do it now in early November it'll happen no problem
[41:29.320 --> 41:30.200]  You'll get it in a couple days
[41:30.200 --> 41:36.360]  But do it now because if you wait till like mid-December you're gonna run up to Wow, you know, maybe or maybe not
[41:36.360 --> 41:42.800]  It'll get to you before whatever holiday it is that you're hoping to get it delivered by so just do it now
[41:42.800 --> 41:47.080]  And what a relief it'll be to get it off, you know get it off your back that you've you know
[41:47.080 --> 41:51.920]  Got these all these people to get gifts for for the holiday season. It's an easy gift to buy
[41:52.400 --> 41:55.080]  It is a gift that makes people really happy
[41:56.280 --> 42:04.040]  But do it now, so here's the important part you remember this code daring fireball use that and you'll get 15% off if it's your first order and
[42:04.040 --> 42:07.280]  and go check them out at their website, which is
[42:07.800 --> 42:09.320]  fracture me
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.800]  Dot-com and remember that code daring fireball and you'll save some some dough on it
[42:14.600 --> 42:16.600]  Nice good segue
[42:17.480 --> 42:20.800]  Yeah, that was a great. They weren't even scheduled to sponsor the show. I just figured I'd
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.280]  Because when you said that I thought wouldn't that be cool if Apple? I was imagining in my mind
[42:27.880 --> 42:29.880]  an edge-to-edge
[42:29.880 --> 42:36.560]  Display with literally no bezel, which you wouldn't want on a hand to help device because you need something for your hands to rest your
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  Your fingers out better be cool on TV
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.600]  Absolutely, and it feels like you know we can all sort of envision a future where screens are
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.400]  So ubiquitous that the materials that make them are and the materials that make them are so
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  You know, so so
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  Negligibly cheap that
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.760]  It's like Blade Runner time and you know every single surface you look around at is glowing
[43:03.960 --> 43:07.560]  You were gonna talk and it's it's a race in time to
[43:08.120 --> 43:16.600]  To see whether that happens or whether we all have augmented reality displays on on our faces and and we don't even need physical screens anymore
[43:18.440 --> 43:21.280]  Friend of the friend of the show. Yeah, 4k friend of the show Todd
[43:21.280 --> 43:28.040]  Taziri who works as they say in the industry
[43:29.320 --> 43:31.800]  It does visual effects
[43:34.480 --> 43:40.600]  He is a listener of the show. He wrote in a guy and I were talking about 4k and and and I was you know
[43:40.600 --> 43:47.400]  Maybe in response to my link to Abdell's thing about me. Hey, maybe Apple will wait till there's this industry transition to 4k
[43:47.400 --> 43:54.680]  To make them move into it. Maybe if they do do a TV set that'll be the time they do it because people would be in a mood to upgrade or whatever
[43:55.720 --> 44:02.640]  Todd told me something. I did not know which is that an awful lot of movies even very recent ones are not
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Mastered in 4k
[44:05.320 --> 44:07.320]  And you probably know a lot about this
[44:08.840 --> 44:11.640]  Yeah, you know, we four k is a great
[44:12.440 --> 44:13.760]  capturing
[44:13.760 --> 44:17.680]  resolution and often you'll do it. You know, there are cameras
[44:18.800 --> 44:22.600]  That shoot 4k or 6k and oftentimes you'll shoot in 4k
[44:23.120 --> 44:25.800]  Just see have the extra resolution to play around with
[44:26.360 --> 44:33.200]  For in post like it makes it really easy to just push way in on a shot and get a close-up where you had and plan to close up
[44:33.200 --> 44:38.800]  You know, let me shot him, you know, medium. Right. In other words, you can crop the image and still have enough pixels to
[44:39.360 --> 44:42.160]  To get a totally usable quality picture out of it
[44:42.160 --> 44:48.000]  Right, but you're not actually mastering a 4k or finishing in 4k even or doing
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.720]  Post-work in 4k's because that's still really really really really render intensive
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.760]  So and especially, you know, most of the stuff that we do is for web anyway, so why would 4k really?
[44:59.760 --> 45:08.000]  I was vaguely aware of this, but I it never didn't really occur to me and the point of this being that if you're waiting for
[45:08.000 --> 45:13.040]  Everything to go 4k and have 4k in your living room and have 4k, you know, images
[45:14.320 --> 45:18.160]  Streaming and stuff like that. It's not even an issue of the bandwidth of streaming in the 4k
[45:18.160 --> 45:23.200]  It's that there's just not it just doesn't make a lot of it the stuff isn't 4k anyway
[45:24.560 --> 45:26.560]  Yeah, the trade-offs are
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.480]  The benefits outweigh the I think it's gonna it's inevitable that it'll happen eventually
[45:32.480 --> 45:39.600]  But but eventually it might be a long time and at the pipeline for the visual effects and stuff like that like doing everything in 4k
[45:39.840 --> 45:46.080]  Even if it like you said even if it was shot in 4k in camera doing everything for the effects and stuff like that in 4k
[45:46.080 --> 45:48.640]  It's too it's too much of a computational overhead
[45:49.680 --> 45:54.000]  Yeah, so so maybe on your breath for 4k TV sets
[45:54.400 --> 45:58.720]  Yeah, but maybe our eyes just need to evolve to be able to appreciate the resolution differently
[45:58.720 --> 46:05.040]  I know that when we go back and look at you know standard depth versus high depth, then there's a real mark remarkable difference
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.680]  And but but it feels like the the diminishing returns started at 10p
[46:12.160 --> 46:15.280]  I think so and you know and maybe it's you know
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.800]  So maybe in other words, don't get your hopes up for 4k everything everywhere
[46:18.800 --> 46:24.960]  And I think there's a lot of boo-hissing going on that the this new Apple TV doesn't support 4k
[46:24.960 --> 46:30.000]  And I just feel like that's it I sort of rolled rolled my eyes at it
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.120]  But now that I know a little bit more I'd do so even more like because there's no way that they could they can't feasibly
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.680]  Send all of the stuff you get from iTunes the iTunes you know movies and TV shows that you buy or rent or whatever
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.440]  They can't send them in 4k. So why what's the point?
[46:48.160 --> 46:51.360]  If you're just gonna be watching the scale 1080p stuff anyway
[46:51.360 --> 46:56.800]  I'm looking forward to when they support stereo stuff, you know 3d stuff
[46:57.360 --> 47:04.800]  Because I do I do enjoy that I do enjoy I have it I have a couple of the TVs are 3d
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.600]  I have a projector
[47:08.480 --> 47:15.920]  And it's a 3d projector and you know with glasses and the whole thing and and there are actually we like with these smart TVs
[47:17.040 --> 47:19.040]  There are apps out there that just
[47:19.040 --> 47:21.040]  You
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.640]  Serve 3d content or or stream 3d content or the like if you buy a Sony Blu-ray player
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.680]  You can put it on your Wi-Fi network and it'll go and grab 3d content and
[47:32.480 --> 47:38.160]  I know that 3d is sort of at a stand still right now. It peaked maybe a couple of years ago with the
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.840]  The number of movies that were being produced and distributed in 3d, but I don't know
[47:43.840 --> 47:50.080]  I think there's still a lot of opportunity there even looking I like I'm staring straight ahead at the the city the screen savers
[47:51.040 --> 47:54.640]  It's the one with the Ferris wheel. I don't even know what city it is that that's London
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.760]  That's the London high the the Ferris wheel right and it's beautiful
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.200]  It's a magic hour or something and I could see like this would look stunning in 3d
[48:07.440 --> 48:11.040]  But I you know the hunger isn't there yet. I hate 3d
[48:11.040 --> 48:13.040]  I do
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.840]  But I don't I don't I don't dispute that you like it and well, I do I mean
[48:20.160 --> 48:23.440]  But I part of that maybe I don't know if you're
[48:24.240 --> 48:31.280]  I know this it precedes itself is my my issue. I actually have not seen a 3d movie in the last
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.320]  Whatever nine months since I've had the the eye issues
[48:36.320 --> 48:42.840]  So I'm curious how that will actually work although we were at Disney and I'd watch oh that you know what?
[48:42.840 --> 48:44.840]  That's funny that you say that
[48:44.960 --> 48:50.520]  That's actually funny. I'd forgot I totally forgotten about this so we were at Disney in July and
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.360]  We were watching one of the attractions that was 3d. I got 3d movie
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.000]  I forget which one made it might have been fill our magic you guys have that on California
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.680]  No, it's a good one
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.880]  Well, but you know, it's like a little seven minute 3d movie and it's you know
[49:09.680 --> 49:12.480]  Not even that new. I know it's probably like 15 years old
[49:13.120 --> 49:23.280]  And at the time in July my you know the vision of my binocular vision combined, you know both my eyes open was really pretty crappy still
[49:23.280 --> 49:25.280]  It's still crappy, but it's gotten better
[49:27.440 --> 49:33.560]  It's funny I almost cried during the movie and I've seen this attraction like I don't know like 15 20 times over
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.880]  The years it was the best I've seen since since my I my left. I went bad
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.720]  It was weird, but I thought I actually went into it thinking about this is gonna. I bet I'm not even gonna see it in 3d
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.800]  And in fact, it was the opposite. It was actually the best I'd seen with both my eyes open
[49:50.920 --> 49:52.280]  period
[49:52.280 --> 49:54.280]  That's super cool. I
[49:54.280 --> 49:56.840]  Like I also had like you know this I
[49:56.840 --> 50:03.160]  I developed an eye problem in the same eye at the same time that you did my my retina kind of exploded and
[50:04.520 --> 50:09.640]  And it's like recuperating now, but you know still like almost a year ago this happened
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.360]  And that was one of the first things it came to mind was oh shoot. I'm not gonna be able to appreciate you know
[50:17.160 --> 50:23.560]  Stereo like 3d movies or yeah virtual reality just as it started and it come to the forefront
[50:23.560 --> 50:26.360]  But what's interesting about that is that you uh
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.120]  Because of where you put the display when you put a VR is VR headset on your face
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.600]  the display is literally like you know centimeters from your eye
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.960]  our millimeters and
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.480]  My vision is my my my my near focus vision is all like a lot better than it
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.720]  You know the distortion that happens from a retinal issue is a lot
[50:49.720 --> 50:53.720]  Worse in the distance than it is near near focus
[50:53.720 --> 50:55.720]  So I can actually probably see better
[50:55.720 --> 50:58.760]  Through virtual reality display than I can in actual
[50:59.400 --> 51:03.720]  Yeah, I have not tried a VR headset recently and I suspect that for me
[51:04.680 --> 51:09.400]  I've again, it's the show monthly devolves into an ophthalmology to show
[51:10.440 --> 51:17.320]  But but I have two I have two issues with my left eye one is I had a cataract and it was removed and so I have an
[51:17.320 --> 51:23.160]  Artificial you know like an old like what old people get in their eye as the focusing lens and it's completely inflexible
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.000]  Completely inflexible because it's just an artificial you know plastic lens
[51:27.640 --> 51:28.200]  um
[51:28.200 --> 51:29.480]  And so I
[51:29.480 --> 51:34.840]  When I have my contact lenses are my glasses on I can't focus on anything within arms length with that eye
[51:34.920 --> 51:39.160]  Because I need reading glasses because it's effective. I have like a 70 year olds
[51:39.800 --> 51:42.280]  Short vision if I take my glasses off
[51:42.440 --> 51:43.400]  I can see up close
[51:43.400 --> 51:48.840]  I can focus with it really close then the second problem is with the retina where everything is distorted when it is in focus
[51:48.840 --> 51:50.360]  It's distorted
[51:50.360 --> 51:56.360]  So my guess is for VR my guess is that it will work for me and maybe it'll work very well
[51:56.360 --> 52:01.000]  And just like watching 3D movies it might actually be the best the thing that I see period
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.320]  But I think I'll have to take my glasses off and I think if I'm wearing my contact lenses it it's not I'm not gonna be able to focus because it's so close
[52:09.320 --> 52:12.600]  Um, but we'll see. I don't know. I haven't tried it
[52:13.880 --> 52:18.360]  Yeah, it'll take some experimentation and you might I mean who knows if VR is
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.200]  Prevalent enough and they might be able to just customize my wonder
[52:22.680 --> 52:28.840]  A headset to your right or maybe there's some kind of calibration step I can go through that would that would handle that
[52:29.560 --> 52:35.400]  Because that actually has occurred to me too for VR because I did I had this same thing that's you and I've talked about this privately
[52:35.400 --> 52:39.880]  But we went through these issues where we had this you know both of us had one eye go bad around the same time
[52:40.360 --> 52:45.480]  And we're both sort of you know technology and movie and game enthusiast. We're not really game, but you know I mean
[52:46.120 --> 52:52.840]  Um, and it's like we're just getting to the point where VR headsets are gonna be commonplace and all of a sudden
[52:53.880 --> 52:56.360]  I might I might not be able to see 3D
[52:56.920 --> 52:59.640]  But I think I actually think it might be the opposite
[52:59.640 --> 53:02.200]  I actually think that I might be able to see better 3D
[53:02.200 --> 53:07.960]  It with a headset than I'd see in a real living breathing three-dimensional world 3D
[53:09.160 --> 53:15.320]  Yeah, yeah, I mean who knows just by biome biome mechanics might just catch up with
[53:16.840 --> 53:21.240]  Our physical failings as we age that would be I've said this before. I've said on the show
[53:21.240 --> 53:27.000]  I don't know if you've listened but my problem with 3D movies is that when I watch a 3D movie a 3D feature film
[53:27.000 --> 53:35.320]  Uh, I find it mentally exhausting in a weird way as though my brain is holding its breath through the whole thing
[53:35.320 --> 53:39.320]  And I walk out inevitably and I don't remember the second half of the movie
[53:40.600 --> 53:44.120]  And then when I said this there's you know, I got some links from people and of course
[53:44.120 --> 53:49.400]  I don't have them handy here, but that that's a real thing that that it's you know
[53:49.960 --> 53:54.760]  It does it taxes your brain in a way and some people for some people it's different than others
[53:54.760 --> 53:57.720]  You know, but for me, it's definitely the case and so that's why like
[53:58.360 --> 54:01.080]  At at like Disney World
[54:02.120 --> 54:05.000]  Going into an attraction where there's a seven minute 3D movie
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.440]  I love it and a lot of them
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.480]  I can watch them over you know over and over again every year
[54:09.800 --> 54:13.720]  And I enjoy it and I find the 3D to be you know
[54:13.880 --> 54:21.000]  exhilarating and fun and everything it's supposed to be and then for like watching an entire 90 minute two-hour feature film
[54:21.160 --> 54:23.160]  I I find it
[54:23.160 --> 54:29.720]  I just find it like like I go into like a blackout like I just come out and I'm like what the hell happened there
[54:30.840 --> 54:36.200]  Yeah, you know, you can't really think as well because the the light is being cut essentially in half and with
[54:36.600 --> 54:40.520]  It's like being a you know, you know how it's like I don't know
[54:41.400 --> 54:45.000]  If you're walking around outside and it's nighttime you're fine
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.400]  If you're walking around outside is daytime you're fine
[54:47.400 --> 54:53.560]  But if it's like that middle if it's if the sun if it's sundown and it's not quite day or night
[54:53.880 --> 54:59.240]  Then your brain is trying to figure out what they taught me in driver's ed that that's actually the most
[54:59.400 --> 55:01.880]  Common time of the day for car accidents by far
[55:02.440 --> 55:04.440]  Absolutely, right. Absolutely
[55:05.080 --> 55:07.640]  Like the way they you know like anything in driver's ed
[55:08.040 --> 55:09.720]  They scared the crap out of you
[55:09.720 --> 55:12.920]  They made it seem like if you're driving at sundown
[55:12.920 --> 55:20.440]  That you you will like most likely die. You probably won't you will be decapitated. That is when you will be that's the decay
[55:20.440 --> 55:23.720]  It's a combination of like you said like it's your eyes how
[55:24.440 --> 55:28.440]  Are like adjusted that your eyes are on daylight so they don't see so good
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.640]  We're supposed to like in the middle of the night when it's it's totally dark your eyes are fully dilated and
[55:34.280 --> 55:36.600]  Whatever else goes on in there to adjust to low light
[55:36.600 --> 55:39.000]  It's all set for low light and then the other factor
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.800]  They said was that lots of people don't turn their headlines on yet because they don't need the headlights to see
[55:44.440 --> 55:47.640]  But the headlights are there so you can see them and people don't know that
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.040]  Right, you know, so I I
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.200]  Went to you would definitely I went to this
[55:58.440 --> 55:59.480]  I went to a screening
[55:59.480 --> 56:06.840]  I think it was like the director's guild theater so here in LA and because John August was a part of this panel on like
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.720]  Technology and film or something. It was really cool and they showed a 3d projection
[56:12.440 --> 56:15.880]  I don't remember what it was. This is maybe the Star Trek movie that had just come out
[56:16.440 --> 56:21.800]  But the the projector that they have the system that they have in this theater is so advanced that it doesn't cut any of the light
[56:22.840 --> 56:28.520]  And that made all the difference in the world between good 3d like what 3d is supposed to be and
[56:29.080 --> 56:35.560]  What most of us think of it is which is you know periodically through the film you're like sort of taking the glasses off
[56:35.560 --> 56:42.680]  And looking at what what the pictures looks like for real and you realize how much brighter. It is that's coming out of the projector
[56:43.080 --> 56:46.040]  And you're like damn why can't it look like this? Why can't it be his bright?
[56:47.480 --> 56:53.080]  So who knows when that technology is going to advance to the point that it's not a terrible experience anymore
[56:53.880 --> 56:55.880]  Pretty so did you get tickets for Star Wars yet?
[56:57.480 --> 56:58.520]  I didn't
[56:59.160 --> 57:03.960]  But you know, I'm not really part of the the whole frenzy as much as I think
[57:03.960 --> 57:11.720]  You only just saw Star Wars the first time like handfulatives. Yeah, I might not have I might not have seen the whole
[57:12.120 --> 57:15.800]  Movies as an adult. I can't really be too sure
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.960]  I laugh because it for those of us who are really really looking forward to it
[57:20.120 --> 57:25.000]  It's like you have to like buy these tickets in advance or else you're like stuck weight in a week or two
[57:25.960 --> 57:27.960]  you know and
[57:27.960 --> 57:32.920]  Like on the ATP podcast John Syracuse an episode ago
[57:34.280 --> 57:36.280]  You know, he and his wife were
[57:36.840 --> 57:43.160]  Both trying to get these tickets for the opening day and his wife and the the fan dango website was
[57:43.400 --> 57:46.920]  Totally, you know, it was like the old days of the Apple story or like when you buy your iPhones
[57:46.920 --> 57:51.000]  It just crapped out. I mean, it just absolutely was it was like given like weird like
[57:51.640 --> 57:56.120]  PHP errors and and HTTP error codes that you never even see it was like
[57:56.120 --> 58:02.920]  You know HTTP error code 517 service server, you know
[58:03.640 --> 58:05.640]  Fainted
[58:05.640 --> 58:08.520]  You know, it's like I didn't know that was in the HTTP's fact
[58:11.080 --> 58:15.320]  It's you know HTTP error code 607 server went for a drink
[58:16.920 --> 58:21.800]  But anyways wife got through got some tickets, but they were 3d and it's like you don't want to you know
[58:21.800 --> 58:22.360]  It was like well
[58:22.360 --> 58:27.000]  She got what she could get, but it's like he didn't want to see 2d, but I heard him say it was actually pretty smart
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  I can actually see doing this where he's you know
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.800]  He's fixed it. He's rectified it so that like his opening weekend tickets for you know
[58:33.800 --> 58:36.600]  Taking his kids and then he's gonna go with some friends. They're all 2d
[58:37.960 --> 58:42.200]  But that he might go see if if the movie is any good if if it holds up
[58:42.200 --> 58:43.160]  And it was worth seeing again
[58:43.160 --> 58:45.880]  Then maybe if he goes see that third time he will go see it in 3d
[58:45.880 --> 58:51.720]  Because he's already seen it and I could see I could totally see doing that my feelings on 3d or such that if the star wars
[58:51.720 --> 58:54.600]  Movie is is good and we decide to go see it again
[58:54.600 --> 59:00.600]  I would go see it in 3d because I feel like that would also alleviate my I don't know what the hell's going on because I'll already know
[59:00.600 --> 59:02.600]  What's going on because I saw it in 2d?
[59:03.320 --> 59:07.080]  Yeah, that's interesting that 3d will get in the way of this story for you in a way
[59:07.720 --> 59:12.520]  It's totally counterintuitive. I would think it's the opposite that everybody's clamoring for the 3d
[59:12.520 --> 59:16.040]  Well, that's it's definitely the case that there are way more 3d showings
[59:16.040 --> 59:20.440]  Like the 2d is sort of the niche showing and it's funny because I mean some places I don't know
[59:20.440 --> 59:24.280]  I don't know if they always charge more for 3d. I know they charge more for iMacs and 3d
[59:25.880 --> 59:29.640]  So it's actually cheaper, but it seems like it's sort of the it's sort of the
[59:30.760 --> 59:32.760]  I don't know
[59:33.400 --> 59:39.720]  It's the one if you care you're going to the 2d like I've seems yeah the purest the star wars purest
[59:39.720 --> 59:43.640]  We'll go to 2d and you don't think that that scarcity is artificial. You don't think that
[59:44.200 --> 59:50.920]  They'll somehow miraculously open up of you know a few thousand more seats the day after it I don't know
[59:50.920 --> 59:56.040]  I wonder I do it. It just seems weird to me at it's like one of those things where it's like I don't go
[59:56.280 --> 1:00:01.080]  Ever since I had the kid I did I don't go to the cinema as much as I used to go
[1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:05.240]  You know it was like the default thing to do on any Friday or Saturday night is you know
[1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:10.920]  Let's go find a movie wasn't even like I knew what movies are out. It was like let's just go see the the movie in a theater
[1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:16.760]  That is looks like the most appealing at the moment. So we don't go to movies that off not much anymore. We watch a lot more of them at home
[1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:20.120]  Which of course we'll bring us back to Apple TV
[1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:25.640]  But it still seems weird to me to buy movie tickets in advance. It seems to me like if a movie is popular
[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:31.880]  It's and then this is I'm just being our car mudgeon, but it just feels to me like you should not be able to buy tickets in advance
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:33.880]  You should have to go wait in line
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:39.800]  Well, we do it here we do it here and then probably a lot of big cities with the arc later
[1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.360]  Stadium seating theaters because you
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:47.640]  Like I know exactly what seat and row. I want to sit in in the theater and so at the arc light
[1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.440]  You can pick your seat in advance, and that's always very
[1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:55.240]  Yeah, I feel like it should be one way to the other it should either be all the way to where you get reserved seats
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:58.520]  And we have we have two two sets of tickets for the Star Wars
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.760]  You know the first night. I think it's general seating and then we have another one
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:08.440]  Like a Saturday mat nay at a place with reserved seating, which I'm really looking forward to
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:14.120]  Because I'm kind of worried at the opening night one. We're not gonna get good seats, but I
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:18.680]  Love the idea of Syracuse had just in a you know
[1:01:19.080 --> 1:01:23.720]  Panic in a sweat panic that he can't get tickets and then he remembers
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:28.840]  Oh my god fending go has a watch out and then he just launches the watch out
[1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.400]  It shows him a movie
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:35.320]  And it's just like a big
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:38.040]  Big old fuck you to those movie
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:44.040]  Just as a quote
[1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:55.800]  Just like it's a quote from dum and dumber and a guy you know with his middle finger. All right, let me take another break here
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:00.680]  And we'll get back to talking about Apple TV and let me tell you about
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.360]  Automatic you guys know automatic that's another long-time sponsor of the show
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:08.360]  They make a really cool connected car adapter
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:11.640]  I call it a dingus. I think it's better to call it a dingus
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:15.720]  They call it an adapter. It plugs into your car's diagnostic port
[1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:21.160]  Every car since 1996 has one of these ports. It's a standard port
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:25.240]  It's like the car equivalent of like HDMI or USB or something like that
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:27.560]  Standard port
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:33.640]  Everybody at all these cars have him. I mean if your car's older than 96. I mean, you know, I guess I can't help you
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:42.040]  But anything since you just plug this thing in it pairs with your phone and then you use Bluetooth that connects to your phone and
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:47.400]  It makes your driving experience better. What does it do? Well, one thing it does is because it is a diagnostic port
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:51.240]  Anything that goes wrong with your car anything that puts like a get service, you know
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:54.840]  It's there's like service you know get you to overdo for service a3
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:57.240]  Well, you want to know what service a3 is
[1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:03.400]  The automatic will tell you what it is if like an engine light comes on instead of just like engine light go go get
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:09.240]  Help it'll tell you exactly what's wrong. So you can tell oh man. This is you know totally serious or oh this isn't that bad
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.400]  I can just you know wait till tomorrow. I'll take it in tomorrow in plain English
[1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:19.080]  It'll tell you exactly what's going on instead of just having like a honor off, you know check engine come on
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:21.320]  That's really cool
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:27.400]  It gives you a log of your trips. It tells you if you want how well you're driving in terms of your efficiency
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:29.480]  so you can set goals for
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:36.680]  What kind of fuel efficiency you're looking for and it can tell you live whether you're doing a good job or not or whether you're you know
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.240]  Little heavy on the gas
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:41.960]  It can even do things like
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:47.240]  Make emergency calls God forbid if you ever got into like a car accident or something like that and couldn't call yourself
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.720]  It can take care of that for you
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:53.320]  Because it has GPS or your phone has GPS at least
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:59.480]  It can do things like remind you where you parked your car. So go to like a big stadium or something like that
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:02.040]  And you can't remember where the hell your car is. It'll tell you where it is
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:05.960]  Really really convenient. They've added so much stuff
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:07.880]  Over the last year
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:13.480]  They call it they have like what they call the app store for automatic and they have over 20 apps available that you can get
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:18.040]  So here's an example nest you got a nest thermometer in your house
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:25.160]  Well, then you can connect it with your automatic and have it set to do something when you get within say
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:26.360]  10 miles of your house
[1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:27.880]  So you're driving home
[1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:33.880]  Have it set up so that when you're seven miles away turn the air conditioning off or on
[1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:36.760]  I guess it would be your turn to heat on in a winter or something like that
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:42.600]  Really cool stuff that you can do like that. They integrate with IFTT if this then that
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:47.880]  Which is a really cool website that gives you these recipes where you can hook things up to you know
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:49.480]  all sorts of things
[1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:52.040]  Really really cool great way to geek out with your car
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.680]  Really really fun. It's it everybody should have one of these things and
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:01.720]  Here's the best part. It's normally just a hundred bucks which is cheap in and of itself
[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:05.480]  There is no service fee you just buy this thing for a hundred bucks
[1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:08.200]  Stick it in your car or pair to your phone and you can use it
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:11.800]  Never have to pay another nickel, but here's the best part
[1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:18.600]  Um, use their code go here and go automatic.com the slash the talk show

[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:51.080]  All right, what else is on your mind with Apple TV?
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.960]  Well, you know, so like I mean to the bigger picture stuff
[1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:57.400]  um
[1:05:57.400 --> 1:05:59.240]  because this
[1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:07.080]  When you I think the most interesting thing to do with it is really to browse through the app store and figure out what it means to be an
[1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:09.080]  app in in the context of
[1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:11.080]  Of this device
[1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:17.640]  Because it's not the same as what an app means on the app store for IOS or for that for the iPhone or iPad
[1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:21.960]  It's not the same as a watch not same as the Mac app store. It's something new
[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:26.600]  And I think that people haven't really wrapped their heads around with yeah, and I think it was the true
[1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:29.640]  I think it was the most true with the iPhone
[1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:31.480]  Early on
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:37.560]  I don't think the iPad quite had this problem because by the time the iPad came out the basic idea of well
[1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:43.560]  It's a big iPhone was close enough that developers kind of got it and and it wasn't just period where people didn't know
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:47.480]  What an iPad app was but with the iPhone there definitely was and in the early days
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:53.960]  Um a lot of them are just sort of like I don't know like websites like websites that were packed onto a phone
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:06:57.720]  Yeah, it took a while because people could figure this out
[1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:04.760]  Yes, and and it's funny just because the what the first thing we always do with a new sort of medium
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:09.640]  is like try to translate the old medium to the new one. That that that goes for
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:15.480]  You know stage to screen and or stage to yeah movies to radio TV
[1:07:16.520 --> 1:07:20.920]  That's the way that when you look at like an old you know like a Jackie Gleason era TV show
[1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:24.280]  It really it just looks like they stuck a camera in front of a stage
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:29.240]  Exactly doesn't mean that they weren't funny and it doesn't mean that they weren't great performers
[1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:33.480]  But it just it they just hadn't really mastered the medium yet
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:38.760]  Because they haven't reframed it or they haven't re they haven't developed the new language around it yet
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:41.400]  um what was so one of the
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:45.800]  Revolatory things for me browsing through the app store when I got when I set it up
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:52.840]  Was like I saw oh there's a fireplace app and then you know skipped ahead a few pages
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.400]  There's another fireplace app and then there's just like this
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:07:58.920]  So downpour of like a fireplace app
[1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:03.720]  There's like a million of them already and it dawn on me that the fireplace app is really like the the fart app for the
[1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:08.680]  Except that it's charming
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:10.280]  It's meant to be charming
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:16.760]  Yeah, and soothing and put you in a good mood and and maybe let you and loved one relax and
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:21.960]  Just enjoy, you know, maybe it's something you put on your TV while you you both enjoy a novel or something like that
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:24.760]  That's right. It is romantic and
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:31.480]  Uh, you know, you can go to YouTube and and find channels that are all fireplace all the time or whatever aquariums
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:35.480]  There and everything but it tells you exactly what this device is for and it's for
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:38.440]  Very very passive activities and it's not
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:42.600]  It's not for anything else. It's not even it's it's not to be meant
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.240]  Nest to be meant like to be used as a soundboard. It's not for anything active. I cracked up when I saw that peacock at a
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:58.600]  At a giant giant apple TV out which is like who like okay? Who is really doing calculations on their on their TV?
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:01.640]  It's hilarious to me and it's it's it's almost like
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.320]  It's almost like it's it's an exercise
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:12.520]  Exercising absurdism to put a calculator app on it on a TV and I'm glad they did it. It's awesome
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:19.880]  Um, but you're not suppose you know what and it's there's he's under no impression that there are kids doing their homework in the living
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:23.880]  Diling the math in on the TV
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.680]  But it helps you like sort of redefine where
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:36.360]  Yeah, I guess redefine what an app is in this context and an app is a mechanism for delivering content like
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:43.800]  Very very passive content that um, I guess like cool cool content television is always supposed to be a
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.800]  Have been a cool medium in McLuhan terms. Um, yeah, I mean clue in terms
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:56.440]  Meaning you can sort of step away from it and you don't have to stare intently or be active while you're using it and
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:57.800]  Um
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:05.240]  So it's really like the most fascinating thing to me as a person who watches media evolve is seeing all the network
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  The major network apps
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:13.320]  Seeing that you know effects has a really cool app that all their shows are on or
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:19.640]  Fox or NBC and that all the networks are like now they're pretty much on board with this
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:22.920]  There are a couple that are dinosaurs and are late to the game and like
[1:10:23.640 --> 1:10:28.040]  Won't enable their content yet through streaming devices, but for the most part
[1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:30.840]  um, they're on there and
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:36.440]  You know what well you have to do is you have to subscribe to a cable provider
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:39.800]  Which I did when we when we moved into our house
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:43.880]  I set up a cable subscription at the lowest amount you could possibly
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:48.520]  buy into which is like I don't know 20 bucks a month or something 20 30 bucks a month
[1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:52.680]  Just so you can enter that code that unlocks the
[1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:55.720]  Channel in in the form of an app
[1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:59.800]  um, but the and that like so okay
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:06.360]  So that's fascinating that now we can get these these channels of content that used to be the big three
[1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:11.640]  They used to be the only thing on the whole televised media landscape. They're now accessible in this little box
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.760]  Time shifted for our enjoyment
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:18.760]  But that they're right next to any other possible
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:27.240]  At the channel of media, you know content that the kid next door could be making that literally anybody could make an app
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:34.600]  Set up a camera make content make make dumb YouTube videos put it in an Apple TV app and it's right there next to ABC's app
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  I think that's fast and
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:42.040]  Feels to me like people are missing that and and maybe there's other ways
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:45.960]  Maybe there's a way to do that on roku or roku. Whatever. I hope you pronounce it
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  uh
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:51.400]  I mean, yeah, that's been around for it's been around for a while
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:56.280]  We shouldn't like be around that that bush and pretend that these are that apples the first person to enable it
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.080]  but I feel like
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.640]  the way and and
[1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:06.440]  The experience that Apple has with apps with an app store and the
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:13.960]  Familiarity that anybody who's used an iPhone or an iPad has with the idea of okay, you go to the app store
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:15.960]  and you
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:23.000]  Tap a thing to buy a thing and it asks you sure and then it then there it is they get it and
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  Yeah, that anybody can build it and the only thing you're gonna get
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:31.320]  You know, the only thing that's gonna keep you out of it if you want to make your own app for Apple TV is you know
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:33.320]  Whether it's like inappropriate content
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:38.120]  You know, but anything that's just like a kid with a YouTube channel if you want to you know
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:42.360]  Also put you like you said you want to put your videos and do their own app and have an app on the home screen
[1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  There you are right next to HBO go
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:50.280]  Yeah, I don't think they I feel like they can't really censor content. Well, they'll you know
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:51.640]  I think I don't you know
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:58.920]  I saw one thing that got filtered out was there's a I forget what it's called like this something something computer club in
[1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:03.800]  Europe and it's like a hackers group and their videos are about like how to like
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:06.360]  jailbreak iPhones and
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:12.120]  You know, and maybe other device and other devices too and Apple rejected their Apple TV app and
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.440]  You know, and you know, that's not it's obviously it's not porno
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:22.040]  I mean, I don't even know what you know like there's the the argument that they're gonna censor stuff that would be more than
[1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:26.840]  Are rated for sexual content or something like that and I think clearly they would they would
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:33.080]  They would censor things for extreme violence, you know, and they're and famously you know
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:37.720]  This is a famous, you know, and it's like whoa, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if I agree with that like they've
[1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:42.840]  They have censored some apps over the years for
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:50.840]  I don't know how best to call out is it politics, but like like if they're if there's like an app that like
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:59.240]  There was like an app that tells you notify you every time that an American drone killed somebody somewhere in the world and
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:02.760]  And that Apple rejected that
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:08.760]  To incendiary. Yeah, it's like they just they just want to stay out of it, you know, and it's you know
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.200]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like that's gonna last very long. Well, but the idea on the media
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:20.120]  Well, maybe it will on Apple TV though because there is no one of the things about Apple TV is because it doesn't have a web browser
[1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:26.360]  There's no open way around it so like that the counter argue the the counter argument for something like the iPhone and okay
[1:14:26.360 --> 1:14:28.360]  They won't put the drone
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:32.120]  You know the the you know what of the US drones done today
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:33.880]  App in the app store
[1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:39.480]  But that's not keeping you from learning about it on your iPhone because you can just use safari and go to a website and
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:41.720]  See it, you know somewhere else
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:45.800]  You just can't have an app in their store that their store has some level of curation
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:50.840]  And they're gonna keep some objectionable stuff which is more than just sexual content
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:54.920]  And again, I think that's a debate to be had if I if it were up to me
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:59.800]  Apple would put the drone app in the app store and let you know let people didn't make their own decisions
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:01.880]  Absolutely, yeah
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:05.960]  I mean maybe they think of it differently because in a piece of software as a tool or
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:10.600]  You know an app in the context of the iPhone is a tool for delivering well
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  I think it's just that they want to stay away from
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:19.400]  I think bottom line is that it is politically charged and that you would say that basically it is
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:24.200]  More or less a left-leaning position to say
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:33.400]  To question the US is even just a question the US is use of drones around the world and it's more of a right-leaning
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:38.840]  Position to support it and say you know if there's some collateral damage
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:46.120]  That's that's what it costs to keep our country safe to you know to wrap up extremely complex issue into very basic things
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:50.040]  It is there is a sort of left-right divide on this and
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:53.240]  You know, I could just see why Apple wants to stay out of it. I
[1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:59.880]  Would I get it? I mean they they want to make the world a better place and they want to have play some role as
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:03.080]  the moral as the moral center for
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:08.120]  I would bet I in fact I would wager extremely heavily
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:13.000]  I would wager thousands of dollars that if somebody submitted an Apple TV app that
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  showed you know
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:23.800]  You know, I don't already on either side of it really I was but was devoted to say abortion politics that they're not going to put that in the
[1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:25.080]  App store
[1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:27.840]  And you know, it doesn't matter which side it was on
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:31.320]  I don't think they're gonna put it in because I don't think I think they're gonna say that's not the type of
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:34.240]  Content that the app stores for so it's more than just sex
[1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:41.040]  Yeah, I think a good rule of thumb would be like if your cable company lets it through the Apple Apple should let it in
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:44.280]  Maybe I don't know, but I think it's all edge cases
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:49.200]  I think for the most part though anything you might reasonably want to put on Apple TV
[1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:51.440]  You're gonna you could put on Apple TV if you want to do
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:55.040]  Yeah, I mean it's really just opens up a
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:02.760]  These apps are just portals for media and it should just open up a portal to whatever kind of media you want to dump in there
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:07.600]  It's it's I don't know why that kind of sucks if they're police
[1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:13.800]  If they're policing it like that. I don't feel I don't either but I I understand that there's some kind of line that has to be drawn
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:20.240]  At some place where Apple there is a line to be drawn that I can get behind I really you know, you remember the old
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:23.240]  Faces of death videos
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.240]  Sure
[1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.160]  Laughing as when I used to rent them as a teenager
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:32.400]  We did we just sat there and watched them and laughed and laughed and laughed but oh
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:36.760]  God I I was younger when we rented them for slower parties
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:40.500]  And we didn't laugh we shut up. Well, we did it first, but then once you know, there's
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:45.000]  As you as I progress as a teenager we went from like
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.480]  Ash and faced. Oh my god. I
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:49.200]  yeah
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:50.520]  to just
[1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:57.440]  Laughing and if you don't know I forget how many they made but there was a series of home videos called faces of death and
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:01.640]  They were effectively it's enough films and they had footage of
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:05.880]  You know terrible things happening to people and and but they
[1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:08.280]  Some of them were clearly fake though
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.240]  It was sort of like a mix of like oh my god that looked real
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.440]  I think that was actually a car accident that killed somebody and then the next one
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:22.280]  There was one where people were reading monkey brains and I you know, I think the monkey brains one was clearly you know
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:24.840]  Pro wrestling it was it was fake
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:29.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think the genre and I found this out recently
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.240]  The genre of that of faces of death the genre that
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:37.400]  Faces of death came out of was something like Mondo
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:44.720]  Mondo like sensationalist filmmaking where and I think it came like there was a lot of it being made in in Italy
[1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:48.720]  I I believe in the in like the in the 70s and early 80s
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:52.280]  Where they would just it was just a
[1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:55.240]  Just a
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:19:00.560]  Baca nal of sex and violence in these sort of pseudo documentaries like I
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:04.560]  Don't know everything to like think of in today's
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:10.040]  Media wherever you would go for the most the maximum amount of titillation of
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:13.120]  sex and violence and
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:19.400]  That's where they would get their rocks off back then is in movies like faces of death. I don't even remember whether there were
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:25.680]  You know boobs in faces of death that they're probably were there had to have been I don't remember I
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:30.800]  I didn't maybe they would do remember feeling a very weird like low-level
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:33.680]  Forming guilt after having watched them
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:39.240]  Absolutely, they were essentially snuff films. We just didn't know like they were very very fake
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:44.240]  You go back and watch it now and you can see all the seams and everything all the fake appendages
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:47.480]  But back then we didn't and they were definitely passed off as being real
[1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:56.560]  Yeah, absolutely, and I just I just remember I guess the guilt that I felt more or less was that it didn't really matter
[1:19:57.080 --> 1:20:04.720]  Whether they were real or not or it mattered because it was almost like I hope that they weren't real because it would be great to know that
[1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:10.360]  Nobody died in that arable way, but the guilt was that it didn't really matter because either way
[1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:16.520]  It's the fact that they I was thought some of them could be real and that I enjoyed
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:22.400]  I had I drew some kind of it. You're getting. Yeah, I found it entertaining. My friends and I were collectively
[1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:28.560]  You know having a good time watching them and it just felt like yeah, it made me a terrible person
[1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:32.840]  And that's how I feel when I watch a horror movie and I don't watch horror movies
[1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:36.720]  But that's absolutely how I feel is like why should I be getting entered any
[1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:45.000]  Entertainment value from this person's pain even it's even if you know it's fictional. Yeah, I just anyway. That's not getting on Apple TV
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:51.800]  No, it won't be oh just on YouTube. I guess
[1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:56.360]  But like do you ever have you stopped have you thought about?
[1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:59.360]  You know that the anecdote about
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:06.720]  Steve on in his on his hospital bed and basically is it like I forget what the line is but basically telling I
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:12.520]  Forget even Isaacson he told but I did he tell Isaacson. I think I cracked it
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:18.040]  Well, do you do you think that applied here? Does it do you think that had anything to do with Apple TV?
[1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:25.240]  I don't think so it's such a weird line and it's such a like
[1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:30.480]  It because it's so tempting right it's almost like
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:35.640]  And I don't doubt like what I have so many complaints about Isaacson's book, but I you know
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:37.640]  I do not for a second
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:43.280]  Question his integrity, so I'm sure that he says that's what jobs told him
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:47.040]  I think he said we and I don't think he said I but either way it was it was either
[1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:52.760]  First-person plural or first-person singular, but that we you know, we I think we finally cracked it
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:54.920]  maybe he said I I'm not sure but
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:22:00.760]  That's all he said he didn't tell him one damn thing about what cracking it meant
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:06.920]  and it's like could you craft a better like
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:13.040]  Yeah, that would just and then everybody can just fill that in with whatever their pet
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:21.080]  Dream of what Apple TV could be is whether it's whether it's you know the actual TV set or whether it's
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:29.680]  Apple replacing cable with the you know $15 a month bundle that lets you stream all the major all the major cable networks
[1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:31.680]  whenever you want
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:38.420]  Or this you know an app store type you know the future TV is apps type thing who knows you know what the hell
[1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:40.720]  I meant I don't think that this is it though
[1:22:41.720 --> 1:22:47.640]  I don't know I mean obviously it does feel like it was it was set in sort of a fever dream state or
[1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:52.840]  But I don't know there's another there's a part of me that idealizes this
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:23:00.600]  The device so much that thinks that it this might this might kind of be what he was talking about and I think
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:03.600]  my thinking is this that
[1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:10.480]  What is like what is the biggest problem that Apple seems to have had?
[1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:13.480]  in bringing
[1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:15.480]  Bringing media to us
[1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:24.240]  Like iTunes in itself as an invention was pretty influential is pretty impactful in the state of
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.400]  technology
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:28.400]  But people complain about iTunes
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.440]  Constantly and people complain about the iTunes store
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:37.160]  Constantly and it kind of sucks the whole process sucks and even with all of the
[1:23:37.160 --> 1:23:46.040]  Resources that Apple has they haven't really figured out how to do that very one simple elemental thing which is deliver us the media that we will
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:48.880]  Use to enrich our lives
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:54.120]  You know you can argue that they had nobody has figured that out very well the cable company's still on it
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:57.120]  still on the ecosystem for the most part
[1:23:57.960 --> 1:24:01.040]  There have been technology companies built up around
[1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:03.800]  delivering us media in
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:12.760]  Smaller channels and smaller formats, but for the most part not much of it is compelling. You could say that YouTube is has been the most
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:16.120]  influential
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.920]  You know, I guess network of
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:22.040]  delivering media to us
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:24.920]  Like on a really really large scale
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:31.520]  But in terms of like making an actual market for that and a marketplace for that where
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:38.760]  Anybody can be connected any audience member can be connected with the media that's going to enrich them the most and be
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.120]  Speak to them the most specifically and I believe that
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:48.000]  That the Apple TV might be the closest that they've come to that
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:55.000]  Everything else I feel like is a tool a tool for work a tool for productivity or play or
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:58.280]  Whatever it is, you know things that you use to do other things
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:05.440]  But I think this device specifically is used to enrich our lives because Steve if anyone knew the benefit of using the
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:11.760]  world's media and art and you know recorded art to enrich his life. I
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:14.960]  Can't help but think if I have to think what he meant by it
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:20.840]  Let's assume that it wasn't in in like a you know fever dream like you said that he really meant it
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:25.680]  I can't help but think that it's this other shoe that she had to drop which is in an
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:33.040]  Apple branded streaming video package pretty much. Let's like I guess like the doing for TV
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:43.800]  What Apple music does from music, which is that you pay a monthly fee and you get to watch all these shows from all these
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.520]  Participating cable networks, you know, and TV networks
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.560]  I don't disagree with you. I think that this is step one to that right and everybody
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:58.240]  I mean this and one reason and there's so much stuff that Apple does that is secret and you know
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.280]  And they try to keep everything completely secret
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:05.520]  But the stuff with the media and negotiations where they have to talk to all these TV networks
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:10.880]  It all leaks like a sieve because these TV network guys and the music people they don't keep anything secret
[1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:15.680]  And they just go but like probably like 30 seconds after Eddie Q leaves the room
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:19.920]  They're on the phone talking to people at the Wall Street Journal about the meeting. They just had with Apple
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:28.360]  I mean so it's it's it's not a fact that they're going to do it because who knows maybe they'll never quite pull it together
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:32.240]  But it's it's it's certain as a fact that they're trying to do it
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:36.160]  And I have heard and I know I'm not the only person but you know
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:43.000]  There's long you know a lot of people have heard that over the last year as they've clearly you know got closer and closer to being able to ship
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.200]  This Apple TV the one with the new remote and an app store and
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:54.360]  Not just built on iOS, but using these little quote-unquote apps that were just XML files to configure
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:27:00.640]  You know what the content was and just you know put a list on the left and preview on the right and up down left right
[1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:05.520]  And that's it but an actual honest to God iOS app, you know UI kit
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:11.160]  App store where you can do games and everything from games to content
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:23.520]  That there was debate within Apple as to whether they could or should ship that this Apple TV before they have the TV
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:28.080]  Content package in place, you know, and there were people
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:33.760]  And I don't want to say who I want to say the executive that Eddie Q was on one side and Phil Schiller was on the other
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:40.440]  But that effectively somewhere in their divisions were Eddie Q's team that does the you know negotiations with you know
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:43.440]  Like the the TV networks and stuff like that
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.880]  You know some of those people were the ones who were pushing for hey
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:49.400]  We you know, there's no you shipping this until we have this in place
[1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:52.560]  And then it was a product side people who are like this is really cool
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.560]  We've got a really cool thing here. We you know we can ship this and we can add the streaming thing
[1:27:58.480 --> 1:27:59.560]  when it's ready
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:00.920]  Yeah, and I
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:07.320]  100% agree with those people with the product people because they do they have and you got to lay the groundwork for something like that
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:17.240]  You cannot reinvent television with one product with one product launch. That's essentially in its version what 2 or 3 2.0 3.0
[1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:25.840]  Depending on how you look at the first iterations, but this this had to be a multi-decade project and
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:34.320]  Yeah, absolutely. It's so Apple to have released the device itself with the rudimentary version of the App Store
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:40.080]  You know to to just lay the groundwork and mentally prepare
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:49.160]  Prepare the consumer base for this so that enough people have them enough people understand what they are and
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:55.960]  Then they launch the service and then it's like oh thank god one box that has everything that I need
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:00.160]  Right, I totally agree with that and I really am
[1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:08.200]  Let's hold this thought I want to talk about it, but what have you I feel like people are selling the new remote control short
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:14.600]  Yeah, it's fantastic. Let's talk about the remote control next because this is like one of my complaints about what
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:18.480]  One weekend people's take on Apple TV, but I want to tell you about
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:22.080]  Another long-time sponsor of the show
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:25.680]  Honestly, it is it could be a great holiday gift
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:29.920]  Although it's the sort of gift that you cannot give somebody and not give them something else
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:34.080]  It's the sort of thing you should do for people in your family in addition to a regular gift
[1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:39.680]  And I'm talking about backblaze backblaze is online backup for your Mac
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:43.840]  Anyone can back update it is all sorts of
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:48.200]  Back-up services backblaze is the one and again
[1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:49.640]  There are a long-time sponsor of the show
[1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:55.400]  But if they had never sponsored the show it is still the one that I would use for me personally and the one that I would
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:57.920]  recommend for everybody in my family
[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:07.800]  Here's how it works you install their app on your Mac and it's written by former X or X Apple engineers
[1:30:07.800 --> 1:30:13.440]  This is truly native code. It's not some kind of thing that you have to run using Java and install a Java VM
[1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:21.480]  It's a real Mac code written, you know real Mac user interface you access it right through system preferences you install it
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:27.720]  There's a free trial period. You don't have to pay right away and what it does is it just backs everything on your Mac
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:33.160]  Up to backblazes servers everything and it doesn't matter. It's not just your startup drive
[1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:37.840]  If you have external drives connected, it'll back those up to there is no limit and there is no catch
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:42.920]  It's not like well you say there's no limit, but really the limits one terabyte and after a terabyte you got to pay more
[1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:43.720]  Nope
[1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:51.040]  The only real catch on size like let's say if you have eight terabytes of stuff on an external drive is that it'll take longer
[1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:57.000]  For the initial upload that's it. That's it. That's the only catch is that there's no way that they can magically make eight gigabytes
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:05.160]  Go from your Mac to their servers in the cloud faster than your internet connection. They can't do magic, but other than that
[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:10.760]  It works great and then once you have the full upload it just runs in the background
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:15.080]  You'll never notice it. It doesn't make your CPU run real fast or anything like that
[1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:20.160]  Just runs quietly silently in the background and just keeps and pushing your stuff up to the cloud
[1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:22.160]  and then when you need it
[1:31:22.840 --> 1:31:24.840]  like let's say disaster strikes and
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:31.160]  Your hard drive crashes, and that's it. That's your only backup. It shouldn't be your only backup
[1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:36.400]  But let's say it is well guess what you you don't have to download everything you could just order a USB hard drive from them
[1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:38.480]  They'll sell you the USB hard drive. It costs more or less
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:45.240]  You can get it overnighted and the next day you've got a USB hard drive delivered to your house that has everything from your backblays account
[1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:46.840]  right there
[1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:51.800]  But 25% of their restores 25% are just one file at a time
[1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:57.120]  So that's the situation where you're let's say in a meeting and you're away from your computer and then something comes up
[1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:00.600]  And say you've got a file on your Mac that would be perfect right now
[1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:02.680]  You if you had it it would be useful right now
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:09.280]  You can just log on to any computer with a web browser log into your backblays account and get one you know that one file that you need
[1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:11.880]  Right there from any computer anywhere in the world
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:14.960]  So 25% of the restores they do are exactly like that
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:21.080]  They have iPhone and Android apps that let you do the same thing access any of your files anywhere in the world
[1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:30.080]  They have backed up over 150 petabytes of total data and they have restored over 10 billion files for their customers
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:37.160]  It is a great service. It is great software and it will make you feel so much better having installed on your computer and
[1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:44.680]  If you install it, I like just when you go home for the holidays put it on your parents computer and just sign up sign your parents up for it
[1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:52.000]  You know, it's not going to sit you back that much. It's five bucks per month per computer for unlimited backup five bucks per computer
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:58.760]  That's the that's it. So just you know give it to your parents or you know somebody else in your family just sign them up pay for it
[1:32:59.320 --> 1:33:05.600]  And someday it's it they're going to thank you a lot because some you know eventually every hard drive goes bad
[1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:10.120]  So stop putting it off go get backed up at backblays.com
[1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:15.120]  slash the talk show the
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:17.840]  Free trial by the way does not require credit card
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:24.280]  I've got one more sponsor coming up. We'll talk a little bit about the remote
[1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:29.440]  I got one more sponsor. I'm very excited about the next sponsor. It's a new sponsor and it's it's going to be groundbreaking
[1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:34.280]  Because I have to I have to read a legal disclaimer
[1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:39.840]  Oh, you're gonna do it right now. No, not I just I wanted to set the stage and I have you know when I
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.000]  Groundbreaking and a legal display. It's disclaimer. I mean that's a good tease and I'm excited
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:46.400]  All right
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:49.960]  I have one complaint about the new remote and that is that I and
[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:54.480]  Thousands of people have made it. I think it's a mistake that it is symmetric
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:34:00.240]  Vertically too. I think it's a mistake and I do think that it looks better that way
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:05.760]  I think it looks great and I think that functionally it it is a bad idea and
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:12.800]  The bad idea for the obvious reason that people started saying I think it's a bad idea that this is symmetric vertically
[1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:17.720]  On September 9th when they first showed it to us and before people had ever even touched it
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:21.280]  Which is that you won't know which way is the right way to hold it in the dark?
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:28.160]  Yeah, and not only that even if you do know that which way is the right way up the buttons
[1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:35.380]  The the buttons are too similar like the circular buttons on the left are all identical
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:40.600]  You know to the touch. Yeah, and they didn't even put a little nipple on one of them
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:44.880]  So you could actually in the dark feel which one is a which one is serious?
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:50.320]  I don't even know. No, you know, I'm looking at it. It looks like the Siri button might have a little indentation
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:53.040]  No, I can't feel it. I can't feel it at all
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:54.640]  I didn't even know until I looked at it
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:35:00.960]  But they're there they identically sized circles and I can't tell you the number of times I've already in the last three days
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:03.920]  Hit Siri when I meant to hit menu
[1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:10.680]  Right, and that's so that's there's two problems there actually so the one problem is if you're holding it upside down
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:17.960]  You'll be swiping on a dead area, you know, because it's actually the bottom of it today and nothing happens
[1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:21.440]  And the other problem and for me
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:26.840]  This is actually more common because I'm I've gotten careful about putting it down facing the right way
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:32.800]  But right if you just take a guess and you just feel around button and you don't know if it's menu
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:36.040]  You have to like it the only way to be sure is if you feel around first and see
[1:35:36.040 --> 1:35:38.320]  Oh, I'm at the top of the buttons or at the middle of the buttons
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:42.240]  But with so few buttons each button should be like a different size or I didn't think about that
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:46.400]  But put like a little nipple on like they do on the f and jk's on the keyboard, right?
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:48.120]  Exactly
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:57.200]  Also, there's no the metaphor of like one side of the you know the bottom is glossy and the top is matte
[1:35:57.800 --> 1:35:59.800]  That doesn't really apply to any
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:07.240]  I don't know like mental model of which side should be a trackpad on which side is not active
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:13.040]  Well, and because the iPhone when you swipe the glossy part yeah, and yeah, I didn't think about that
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:15.040]  But that's true right
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:21.160]  That is actually I didn't even think about that, but that's an outstanding point where the glossy feel is what you swipe on an iPhone
[1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:22.960]  Yeah
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:24.880]  The other thing I thought of and this was a complaint
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:31.400]  I saw some people defending the symmetry of the remote which is that that tactile difference that if you're feel the
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:38.480]  Shiny, you know, it's upside down, you know to turn it around my problem with that is that if you just decide to go by touch of
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:49.280]  Of the is it glossy or matte if you have it held the right way and you start rubbing your thumb over the matte part something happens right away as soon as you touch it
[1:36:50.480 --> 1:36:53.160]  Something happens right away in always rub the bottom
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.920]  In general, but then if you have it upside down and rub the bottom and you have it backwards something will happen in other words
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:06.480]  You know, you'll you'll immediately start scrubbing forward or backward in the video stream or something like that now
[1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:12.440]  The fact that something happens as soon as you start touching it is actually to me part of and again
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:13.520]  I know it's an abused term
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:20.480]  But part of what makes it feel magic and so if you know you have it held in your hand the right way and you just want to
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:23.880]  Start scrubbing around fast forward or rewind in the video
[1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:31.640]  It is marvelous that you just touch it and just move and it just is instantly it feels live in a way and it really does
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:38.960]  Remind me of of the original iPhone and when you first just started moving up or down in a scrolling list or on a web page
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:45.960]  And it just moved instantly and just tracked your finger and it just felt like so much more alive than anything
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:51.080]  I'd ever scrolled before the this remote feels alive in a way that like nothing
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:55.360]  I've ever felt before because you just touch it and it and it affects what you see live
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:02.040]  But in terms of deciding whether the or the remote is in your hand the right way. It's it's terrible. Yeah
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:05.240]  Still unattractive remote though
[1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.800]  It really attractively designed
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:15.840]  Think back to the first the first version of the Apple remote the white one though the white chicklet I
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.600]  Remember it well, I remember it
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.440]  And it's still had the still had the innovation of the of the wheel
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:28.920]  You know like the the circular buttons. All right. It was it was really cleverly designed
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:30.160]  It just wasn't very attractive
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:30.560]  All right
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:36.040]  But the one thing that that design had my problem with the old remote was mainly the fact that it was IR
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:41.800]  And I hate IR and but if they had done a Bluetooth version of that it wouldn't be as good as this
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:46.080]  And I've heard some people say they could have just done a D-pad, you know up down left right
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:50.160]  And it would have been just as good as this and I totally disagree with that. I really do
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.480]  I feel like the momentum you can get from swiping
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:55.800]  I still like I'm feel still getting good at it
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:59.680]  I'm getting like my sea legs on on how fast to go and stuff like that
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:05.240]  But I'm already good enough that I it's so good and it's so much better than click click click click click to go over
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:09.280]  So much better so much better. It's it's not but it's um
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:16.520]  It just feels like multi-dimensional. It's just it feels like you're in you're in in volumetric space even though
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:21.960]  There's no 3d touch to it yet, but but the one thing about that old design is that you could never ever ever
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:24.920]  Forget which way it was the right way to hold it in the dark
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:26.600]  Sure
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:33.760]  somebody actually the Titans were at the top somebody tweeted me the other day and and you didn't have to worry about which button was which because
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:38.080]  The the placement was such that there was never any ambiguity to it
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:41.960]  There was one circle and then two buttons underneath and that's it
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:47.680]  Yeah, so you know you wouldn't even that it not just which way is it in your hand, but which button is which you'd never be confused either
[1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:50.200]  right
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:52.440]  You know it was it perfectly
[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:55.720]  Capable remote to use blindfolded
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:58.960]  As is one way to put it which is a good thing to be
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:04.120]  I I think somebody tweeted me the other day that I shouldn't be watching TV in the dark. That's bad for my eyes
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:09.560]  What that's so old-fashioned. Yeah, and I'm only supposed to watch TV in the dark
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:15.680]  And I was gonna say that that's crazy. I've you know, how else are you supposed to watch a movie and then I realized wait
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:19.920]  I can't I can't dispute you know, it'll it'll be bad for your eyes anymore
[1:40:21.320 --> 1:40:24.800]  You know, it's maybe that's the problem. Maybe the fact that I've spent you know
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:31.560]  30 some years watching TV and is in as dark a room as I possibly can is exactly what happened to me
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:32.920]  I don't know
[1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:36.320]  God remember when Phillips was making those TVs that would glow
[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:42.200]  The wall be it color behind you. Yeah. Yeah. What a dumb stupid idea
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:48.600]  I have this one TV that I bought a few years ago. It's I think LG made it and
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.760]  The remote for it was one of those space remotes that you hold in the like
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:58.160]  Well, it was like a Wii remote basically a Wii mode
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:03.720]  Where the cursor on screen would do like would be wherever you're pointing to it. Yeah
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:07.680]  Yeah, like you're sort of like such such such a delight on what you wanted
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:11.120]  Yeah, exactly and such a dumb idea. I was badly calibrated
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:17.200]  The actual shape of the remote itself didn't have a flat side so you couldn't set it down on a fun at table
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:21.440]  Just such a such a bad bad idea
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.040]  it's
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:29.480]  And we you know over the years I feel like I've tried all the universal remotes from radio shack
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:32.480]  Universal remotes to the Logitech Harmony remotes
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:37.440]  Always because it's it's always just been such a pain in the ass to
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:44.120]  You know switch inputs on eight different things to get the audio and video where you need them to be
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:47.440]  This is quite elegant
[1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:53.440]  I do wish I also feel I do I feel like in addition to being
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:01.000]  Asymmetric I it's funny that you brought up the nipple the other thing I thought is that it seems weird to me that they made the home
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.320]  Button not centered at the bottom
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:12.680]  Yeah, like on an iOS device cuz totally done perfect place for it. Yeah, and I even feel like the icon for it should be a
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:20.920]  Rectangle like the rectangle of the apps not a TV set and I even such a weird icon
[1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:26.120]  Yeah, it just seems weird to me because I've heard people on podcast talking about this
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:29.560]  And they don't even know what to call that button whereas if it was at the bottom
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:37.000]  Center and it doesn't have to be at the bottom of their moat, but just underneath all the other buttons centered with a rectangular icon
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:39.480]  Everybody would know exactly what it is. It's uh
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:42.280]  It's the home button and it takes you home
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:47.480]  And you double click it if once you think of it as the home button and you know it's the home button
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:52.520]  It makes all the sense in the world, but it's in such a weird spot and it has a weird icon
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:43:00.360]  The other thing I would like and I can't help but think it'll come eventually. I hope would be touch ID
[1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:05.080]  And it would you know in terms of a long run, you know like you know
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:06.440]  I don't know if it would come next year
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:11.560]  But if you know within the next two or you know one or two years if it came out with one of these remotes with touch ID
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:13.960]  It would solve an awful lot
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:17.080]  I would hope of these problems that people are complaining about with well
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:21.000]  I have to keep entering all you know passwords for this service for that service and stuff like that
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.440]  And you know get it and touch ID and I don't know
[1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:29.800]  Be some way to do it and then even then let's you could do things like you know like
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:35.720]  Just one example like everybody. I think sets up their iTunes so that you don't get asked for your password again
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:43.960]  I mean, that's what I did right your options are like ask every time ask once an hour or never ask again for your iTunes password
[1:43:44.760 --> 1:43:49.960]  So I have it set up to never ask again. I totally understand that there are some people depending depending on how
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:55.640]  Rambunctious your kids are that the you know, you maybe you don't want to leave it set like that because your kids
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:57.800]  Well download a lot of stuff
[1:43:58.120 --> 1:44:00.440]  So having touch ID in the room though wouldn't that be great?
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:05.320]  Then you could have it set so that you just use touch ID every time you want to buy something but then it's only got like
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.080]  The adult at the adults in the house thumbprints on it
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:17.160]  Sure, but I'm sure like they'll probably enable the remote app be and which you know on a device that has touch ID
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.640]  Available to it before they
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:22.520]  Before they redesign their remote with touch ID
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:28.920]  The remote let's talk about the the remote app the iOS app. Oh, I don't know that that might be going away
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:36.040]  Well, you have inside of no, I don't have inside information other than the fact other than the fact that that app
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:42.120]  Was never really a big part of their strategy or plan for how you would use
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:49.400]  You know anything it was sort of like the work of like one guy within the company who made it and
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:53.720]  Got it, you know, I was like I think we should ship this, you know, I think you know
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:58.920]  We can do some cool things, but it was so useful. It was so useful. Yeah, but the company was never behind it
[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:02.600]  Here's what I think and I do I did think about this in the last week
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:06.440]  Where for the last couple of years ever since hey there Apple you know
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:10.040]  The rumor that Apple is building a next generation Apple TV has been out
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:17.000]  Like one of the number one theories that people have tossed out on Twitter or written to me and email readers of the site
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:22.120]  Is the theory that it won't even come with a remote and you'll use your iPhone as the remote
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:27.320]  And I've always shot that down because you cannot sell a
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:30.840]  $100 or even a hundred and fifty dollar box
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:36.840]  That requires it needs a seven hundred dollar remote control and you cannot there's it's you know
[1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:43.640]  It doesn't matter how careful your kids are you can't have little kids you see using you know
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:46.600]  Even the iPod touch is like the cheapest thing you can get like a
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:51.240]  $200 thing with a glass screen as the remote control. It just does not fly
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:00.200]  But I think it's so funny that not only were they wrong that the Apple that an iPhone or an iPod touch would be the default
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:06.680]  Remote for the Apple TV, but that they've gone so far as to actually not let you use it as one with the remote
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:11.800]  App like it was like the worst it could not be have been a more wrong prediction
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:18.840]  Yeah, but it doesn't make it's not one that makes sense in any way like why if why not enable software from another
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:25.880]  Platform from another one of their devices that extends the capabilities of of this device. It's such an easy
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:34.280]  Not easy technically. It's probably really difficult. I really see conceptual. I don't know and and the one area where I feel like it really
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:35.720]  Would be useful
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:39.800]  Yeah, especially and everybody's complaining this week because of the first run where you know
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:41.000]  Yeah, and it ends up
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  I didn't know this but I learned that if you sign up for Netflix through iTunes
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:52.200]  That you don't have to enter your password again that it comes it is somehow included in your iTunes account
[1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:59.160]  But I don't know I think like most people I signed up for Netflix long enough ago that I I pay Netflix directly
[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:01.720]  And so yes, I had to enter our Netflix password
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:09.240]  But for entering passwords or anything you actually have to type being able to do it on the phone was it's such an
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.480]  Incredible convenience
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:16.320]  And it is odd I know and some people complain that guy and I kind of blew it off last week
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:22.920]  But it is kind of curious that the old Apple TV would let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard and it still lets you pair
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:29.640]  Bluetooth things you compare any Bluetooth like universal remote control and you compare universal or not universal
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:32.280]  You know Bluetooth game controllers
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:39.160]  And it's therefore very conspicuous that they won't let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard with it
[1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:44.680]  Which might only be useful or at least would be the most useful in like the first day or two
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.560]  That that you have the thing and you're setting up these accounts and entering your you know
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:51.480]  Comcast
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:53.480]  Email and stuff like that
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:48:00.200]  Mm-hmm. You know what I would have liked to have the option to do even though this would definitely be a power move or a power user move
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:04.200]  Is just used Siri to say the same my password out loud
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:07.640]  It sounds so stupid when I sit when I put it that way
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:13.040]  And because all my passions are like ten character passwords are ten character hashes from one password anyway
[1:48:13.240 --> 1:48:18.160]  But I would easily I would easily prefer saying capital a nine
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:24.000]  You know seven has to you know, yeah, and I could see how that would work in it
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:29.760]  If Siri was expecting you to spell it like if they said like if they it was like an option on screen that said
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:35.200]  Spell your password to Siri and so if Siri knew that it was listening for you to say
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:39.520]  Letters and numbers and like the word capital and uppercase
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:45.360]  It would I think that Siri would definitely be able to do that
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:52.280]  So you don't think it was a real scheduling thing that a development schedule thing that I think some of it might be
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:57.920]  I think I I think that the Bluetooth keyboard. I hold out hope still might be a scheduling thing, but
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:04.960]  Jason Snell on on the upgrade podcast. I just linked to it today. I thought it was a great episode with him in my early but
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:12.400]  Jason pointed out I didn't know this, but he at the September 9th event where they announced all this he
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:13.760]  I
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:15.760]  Stutely asked the question
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:22.120]  at the hands-on area. Hey, is this does this new one work with the remote app and
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:29.960]  He was sort of expecting either the answer. Yep. It'll work. You know, it'll work by the time it comes out or he was expecting
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:35.680]  What if it doesn't or they didn't yet or they didn't want to say or the person didn't even know that they would just give it a typical
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  Apple answer which is
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:43.800]  You know, we're not talking about that or we don't know and instead the answer was no
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.160]  And he was like no, it's not going to work and he ever like no, that's that's not going to work and
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:51.360]  That was that was a bit you know
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:55.440]  And he even said that was not I didn't expect that to be possible because I thought even if that was the answer
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:59.520]  They wouldn't say it, but instead they were already willing to tell people on September 9th of war
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:01.880]  I don't get it. I don't quite get why not
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:08.960]  Well, what was the functionality of the remote app did like we're free you did use the remote app only for type
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:16.600]  The old Apple I never used it to go up down left right because I found because it it the actual interface to me the mismatch between
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:19.120]  swiping
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.120]  and an interface that only had
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:30.600]  Didn't have any kind of analog it wasn't like you could swipe fast to go far like swiping to the right would just go over one to the right
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:36.360]  Whether you swiped a little to the right or a lot to the right or slow to the right or fast to the right
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:40.320]  It just went over one and that never felt right to me and that and I well
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:43.120]  That's every week so much more sense on this one though
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:48.160]  Because that's actually the meh of the I that's that's actually the interface
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:51.920]  I guess you're right and you know couldn't they just put up a fakie fake
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:59.760]  You know I would I would envision that a modern version of the remote app would look a lot like the remote where let's say the top
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:04.280]  But I instead of being 5050 I would just say like the top two thirds or top
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:10.160]  Maybe almost all of it would be a swiping zone and then at the bottom there'd be buttons for Siri and
[1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:14.120]  Play pause and plus minus for volume
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:17.760]  Yeah, I would use the remote app for navigation
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:23.200]  When the when the real remote app or when the real remote would disappear. Yeah, that's the time
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:30.240]  Sorry, and it constantly does right because I often stay up later than the rest of the family and then that's when I watch TV
[1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:35.440]  Or I watch movies that nobody else wants to share and oh what I noticed speaking it. Sorry. Sorry. Go ahead
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:37.440]  I have something
[1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:41.640]  There are times where I there are times where I will spend 10 minutes looking for the Apple TV remote
[1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:45.520]  Yeah, and then I say screw it because you know the hell with it
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:48.680]  I'll just use the remote app and it was always a nice fallback to have
[1:51:48.680 --> 1:51:53.480]  Yeah, and the watch app was pretty fun to use to tiny little trackpad
[1:51:54.280 --> 1:52:00.520]  What I was well, just let me say this I think I said did we say this last week that it's it does seem damn curious that even
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:04.920]  Tim Cook himself has been you know four months ago was talking about how he
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:08.680]  One of the favorite things he does with this Apple watches control his Apple TV
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:14.440]  Yeah, and now that doesn't work and it makes me I just assumed that Tim Cook was using the new Apple TV
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:18.680]  You know for like a year or something like that, but it I guess not I?
[1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:23.400]  But I bet they have something coming that's just different you know different from the remote app
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:25.320]  I they've got to be doing it. They've got to be
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:30.680]  What I was gonna say though is I also like you I I stay up late and
[1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:33.400]  We'll watch TV when the rest of the families asleep
[1:52:34.120 --> 1:52:37.240]  And so I have headphones for my my TV
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:42.440]  And I have the headphones when I first set up the out the new Apple TV and I realized how
[1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:44.440]  Stereophonically
[1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:48.520]  Like spatially cool the sound design is in the UI
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.960]  Like where you know the navigation really really heavily favors left or right
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:56.440]  Depending on where you are on the screen. It's very cool
[1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:01.480]  I don't know if anybody's picking up on that because most people don't watch TV through headphones. I
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:04.680]  Dang, make me want to try it
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:08.680]  That sounds awesome. I think the sound design of this thing is amazing
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:14.440]  I know some of the sounds are very similar to the old Apple TV, but there's subtle ways that they feel more alive
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:18.600]  Well, they're less percussive like just the the you know the
[1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:23.720]  The old Apple TV was full of like bings and bongs with hard sounds at the time
[1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:29.320]  You know at the top of the sound. Yeah, like just those like you know punk like kind of the t-vote kind of sounds
[1:53:29.320 --> 1:53:36.680]  But the new one is very very like soft sounds like round soft like just melodic sounds that are just really pleasing
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:40.760]  Hmm, yeah, that sounds exactly right to me, and it's a funny little
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:49.200]  It's a funny little contrast with the visuals which are that the the the icons and the posters are
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:57.280]  Sharp corner rectangles as opposed to the round rectangles and round squares that we've had on all these other iOS things for a while
[1:53:57.280 --> 1:54:04.400]  That's a great point. Yeah, there's just they they'll put sharp elements in places in soft elements
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:10.360]  In other places and I would say just the way that the like we were talking about before the way that the icons pivot and
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:15.680]  Sort of roll around is very soft. That's us. That's a very soft animated element
[1:54:15.680 --> 1:54:17.280]  Yeah, because I think the root
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:25.120]  I think to me the aesthetically how they get away with making these sharp corner rectangles for the app icons and for the you know
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:33.280]  movie and show posters poster images the way they make that work and have it feel lightweight is because it feels like they are
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:37.560]  Paper thin yeah, and the fact that they
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:42.320]  Pivot like you said like they're on a ball joint, which is exactly right is
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:55.440]  It just increases the sense that it's not just paper, but like really thin lightweight paper. Yeah, I I love that idea of weight in in UILans and
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:00.480]  That this somehow strikes a balance between like feeling like it has weight
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:07.440]  But feeling you know and rigidity, but but still that it's like it's got the lightness of digit of digital
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:15.520]  Elements yeah, and there is there is like and to me it speaks to the what makes me excited about what apps?
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:22.080]  People are gonna come up with and the games that people might come up with that maybe our games that aren't quite
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:28.200]  Wouldn't quite make as much sense on the iPhone or something like that. It'll make perfect sense here is the the
[1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:33.520]  That there's clearly just in the built-in interface a a sense of feel
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:40.520]  The connection between your thumb on the remote trackpad and what you see on screen and the way that look
[1:55:40.520 --> 1:55:44.320]  You know if you just move it your thumb so subtly it is
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:49.840]  reflected instantly in what you see in a very tangible way
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:56.120]  I know it's it's weird because it's not direct touch and it's you know
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:59.240]  That would be the stupidest thing in the world to have a TV that is actually a touch screen
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:04.780]  I mean other than certain weird context. I get a museum or something like that. Yeah, you know
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:11.400]  But to me it at that one of the things that this has that to me
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:16.400]  I've never seen on any other device is that it feels like I'm touching my TV. Yeah
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:21.240]  Well, you know, you know, you remember that like that's how the world is introduced to multi-touch
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:28.200]  Before the iPhone there was that everybody got fascinated by that Jeff Han the guys Jeff Han
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:32.960]  Yeah, the Jeff Han display that then CNN started using and everything like that. That's what we well
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:37.760]  That's what we think of or that's what we used to think of when we thought about touching and you know
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:42.280]  All that's Microsoft surface the original Microsoft. Sure. Yeah, the table. Yeah
[1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:46.840]  So I downloaded
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:52.000]  Lumenos City because the trailer is beautiful, but I could not figure out a plague
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:57.480]  I'm not a game guy and I feel like I felt like such an idiot trying to figure out what to do
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:01.560]  I didn't hear that lost Lumenos City. Lumenos City. It's like one of the featured apps
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:04.560]  It's just like gorgeous about a little girl. It's almost got that
[1:57:05.320 --> 1:57:09.960]  Monument Valley kind of papercraft feel to it. It's it's really beautiful
[1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:16.000]  So you know, I just put that up and I downloaded Nevins game space age. Yeah, which of course is super fun
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:22.400]  But I'm just I'm not gonna use this as a game device. I'm absolutely not. I don't use my iPhone as a game device
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:25.040]  I'm gonna use this to get
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:30.720]  Hopefully all of the content that I ever need to watch or want to watch. I don't know that I will have
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:35.120]  Spend a lot of time in the long run playing it as a game device, but like you know
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:40.400]  Jonas who is obsessed with video games to the point where it's you know, maybe a problem
[1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:47.040]  And hey, we have a ps4 so to me it's been an interesting litmus test
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:54.560]  And he's still interested in it as a gaming device. I mean and you know, and he knows what it is but
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:58:01.360]  Even somebody who like him who likes playing serious, you know, what do you call AAA title you know
[1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:05.920]  50-60 dollar games like you know, what's the one he's playing a destiny?
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:13.600]  You know destiny is a thing for the ps4, but he's in getting enjoyment out of some of these casual games, you know
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:18.920]  Like you know, maybe there's only 10 minutes before we expect to be eating dinner and he's got 10 minutes
[1:58:18.920 --> 1:58:21.520]  It's he's enjoying playing some of these Apple TV games
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:28.320]  I played a game last night, and it's the longest I've played a video game. I think in over a year or at least
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:33.120]  I can't even remember the last time I played a video game for an hour. It's this game game called
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.760]  Paco PA KO
[1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:45.600]  In the first level, I actually did play a couple other levels then I didn't enjoy any of them nearly as much as the first level
[1:58:46.080 --> 1:58:50.720]  I think I paid three dollars for it or four dollars. I got way more than four dollars of enjoyment from it
[1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.360]  I may not play it in a long run, but have you ever heard of this game PA KO?
[1:58:54.400 --> 1:59:00.080]  I'll put it in the show notes so the gist of it is you're in like a little isomorphic 3d
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:05.680]  Parking lot. I'm you're in a mall parking lot and I like go on and you were
[1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:10.080]  They don't tell you who you are, but I imagine that you're a teenager
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:16.240]  Driving like your parents car and you're just raised in hell. It's like a little like black hatchback like a
[1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:18.640]  VW rabbit type looking thing
[1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:24.800]  And you're in a parking lot and there is no way out of the parking lot and the cops are coming because there's been a report
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:30.480]  Somebody driving like a nut in the parking lot and your car it's as though the accept
[1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:34.880]  There is no break and the accelerator is down to the pedal and there's nothing you can do about it
[1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:36.880]  And all you can do is turn left or right
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:45.440]  That's so fun and all you do is drive around a parking lot for as long as you can until and the police are trying to smash into your car
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:50.560]  And so if you smash into anything you're done if the police smash into you you're done
[1:59:50.560 --> 1:59:56.320]  And that's it and there's no way to get extra lives. That's it. You're just drive around a parking lot raising hell
[1:59:57.360 --> 2:00:00.400]  as for as long as you can and
[2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:05.760]  It's hard and it's a hard game. It's like that definitely came to somebody in a dream
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:08.560]  Like that's a total anxiety dream
[2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:12.800]  And I might have even spoiled it a little bit here by
[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:17.440]  Telling you that you can't get out of the parking lot because I actually I actually didn't know
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:21.360]  I just saw this on the Apple TV and I'm in this mood of trying to figure out
[2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:25.120]  What's possible and what's available in this Paco game look cool, so I got it and
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:30.160]  Started playing and it doesn't really tell you what to do. It and it just says you know
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:34.720]  You know, it's almost like a TV news flash like the thing at the bottom of CNN
[2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:37.920]  It just says like reports of trouble at the mall parking lot
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:45.200]  And then it just says go and then you're at a car just goes and there's no way to make it slow down or stop and you just go left or right
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:52.480]  That's I spent like the first 15 minutes trying to find my way out of this parking lot until I figured out that there is no way out of the park
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:01:00.080]  God it's a neighbor right and there's like no way to win that you can't it's not like if I as far as I know
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:01.360]  I don't maybe there is a way to win
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:08.080]  I don't I had one where I got it over two minutes and that was my longest run by a long shot and it just you don't get any
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:10.320]  You don't get anything for it
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:12.040]  What other?
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:17.760]  What other game not non-game apps of you try it out download it used. What are your favorites?
[2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:24.240]  I mean think about non-game apps mostly just video content, you know, it's mostly a lot of the same stuff that I had on the old Apple TV
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.240]  But I find it, you know a lot easier
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:30.680]  I know one of the big common complaints is
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:37.880]  Over and over people. I see in these reviews people saying like they want the voice search to work in more places and I
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:45.680]  I just to me that is it absolute. This is a 1.0 and it's you know, it's coming I think and it's just a
[2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:49.880]  Beast yeah, I mean serious still pretty limited in an iOS in general
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.920]  Compared to what it can that will it should eventually do. Yeah. Have you what other apps have you seen it that caught your eye?
[2:01:56.600 --> 2:01:58.120]  I like
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:00.520]  Air video do you know the air video out?
[2:02:00.520 --> 2:02:05.080]  No, I'm writing it down. It's just really it's just really cool app where if you have like media on
[2:02:05.080 --> 2:02:07.560]  On on your on a server at home
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:16.200]  Oh, I've heard of this. Yeah, it's just basically a great like seamless and really really fluid way of getting of
[2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:18.320]  streaming
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:25.440]  media to your device and so like I have a Mac mini in the closet where the cable modem and everything is hooked up where my
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:33.120]  What why my airport router and everything is and it's got like movies and stuff that I don't want to keep on a laptop and
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.120]  and so
[2:02:36.240 --> 2:02:42.280]  The you can browse to that if you keep it in your iTunes library where your media server is you can
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:44.480]  Watch it through
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:49.440]  iTunes, but that's always been a pretty terrible experience. So air video makes it a not terrible experience
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:51.760]  That's very cool
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:03:00.680]  And it's also like they had pioneered. You know that that really really cool scrolling thing that the new Apple TV does where you get just a really like good real-time picture of
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:07.560]  Where in the timeline you are yes, you and guy talked about on the last episode
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:15.440]  Air video had that like already in their iOS app, and it's it's just really really really good like you
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:20.200]  It's just well engineered. It's one of those apps that you know third-party developers have made that
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.720]  Just feels like the engineers are just so smart. They should probably be acquired
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:34.240]  I mean it has figured some shit out for for Apple. It's just one of my one of my frustrations with the what people are saying about Apple TV and I
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:37.720]  forget if it was you
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:40.600]  Somebody else on Twitter was saying that's like
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:48.880]  90% of what's there is awesome and 10% is serious, you know problems that we can complain about and all everybody is talking about is the 10%
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:50.120]  That's problematic
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:56.560]  Yeah, and then not only that, but the 10% that represents the first your first hour with the device and then not anymore
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:01.480]  Right, I I feel like I want to I want to pay extra money
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:06.440]  And have it Apple give it to the team that made fast forward and reverse work like this
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:11.920]  Yeah, and it's the best fast forward and reverse. I've ever seen on any device and after a week with it
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:16.680]  I'm willing to say it's better than t-vos. It is the best that I've seen it is so good
[2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:22.400]  It is exact and again, I'm sure all computers will work like this someday
[2:04:22.400 --> 2:04:28.400]  But up until this point fast forwarding and reversing and scanning in video, especially streams
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:34.960]  It's been absolutely horrible. It's a crap shoot and this it's like you can go exactly to where you want and it's
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:37.240]  instantaneous, and it's amazing
[2:04:37.240 --> 2:04:42.640]  Yeah, and even the thumbnails to me are like higher resolution and bigger than any thumbnails I've ever seen before
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:45.560]  Yeah, they're great
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:47.560]  I I love that
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:51.840]  By default they didn't load a bunch of a crap
[2:04:52.680 --> 2:04:58.720]  In on in the home screen for me. Yeah. Yeah, you know because even the version three of the Apple TV
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:04.840]  You buy a new one you take it home and it's got all the Disney XD and all the Disney
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:09.400]  Crap and then it's got like crunchy roll. What the hell is crunchy roll? I don't need crunchy roll
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:12.480]  I don't need korea TV shirts. I don't need crunchy roll
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:14.480]  Yeah
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:19.040]  It's got all this crap that you end up resenting. It just feels like cruffed like an old we you know
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:25.240]  Oh windows windows box or something like and they didn't do any of that like Fox News financial UK
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:31.760]  Why is that on there? I don't need that and but that would have undermined the whole point of them
[2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:37.720]  Apple TV App Store if they had loaded anything besides just the very basic. Yeah, you know three
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:40.120]  there's movies TV and
[2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:44.040]  settings and I forget what what else they didn't even have YouTube
[2:05:45.080 --> 2:05:47.160]  Preloaded on there. Yeah, you have to do the work
[2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:51.200]  Go and find it and then your mind is blown by what else is available
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:57.400]  Yeah, and I thought it was there was a cool section of and I know that they didn't have top charts right away and people
[2:05:57.400 --> 2:06:04.360]  Complaint about it and I and they've already got them. They already have I really think it was the fact that because nobody had used the thing outside
[2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.360]  Apple they couldn't have top charts because
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:11.200]  Sure, nobody was there, but they had a cool thing that really helped me at first
[2:06:11.200 --> 2:06:13.280]  I thought and again overall
[2:06:13.280 --> 2:06:18.320]  Yes, the first run experience could use some help so that you don't have to enter so many passwords over and over again
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:24.360]  And some people are hitting weird snags where that they've got to jump through hoops to get their
[2:06:24.840 --> 2:06:29.880]  iTunes account so they can buy stuff you have to like go to it. You have to go to another device and go to
[2:06:29.880 --> 2:06:37.120]  Your Apple ID page and a web browser and verify your address or something like that didn't happen to me
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.960]  It doesn't seem to have happened to most people did happen to Jason. So that's a you know huge pain in the ass
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:48.720]  And whatever the problem is causing that they ought to look into it because you know Christmas morning that that's that's not a fun thing
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:53.240]  What what I would love to be able to change is that when I you know
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:56.920]  I keep like movies is top left of my home screen
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:01.840]  And they will show you your purchased movies in the in the you know the top header
[2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:09.040]  Yeah, first and then and then like the top movies on the store after that and I have purchased three things apparently
[2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:12.840]  One is frozen, which I've never watched but Roxanne is
[2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:17.200]  But Roxanne is niece and nephew were over and they wanted to watch frozen so I bought it
[2:07:17.200 --> 2:07:22.400]  The second one is real genius, which is my favorite movie and then the third one is Disney paper man
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:24.840]  Which I watched once and is is really nice
[2:07:24.840 --> 2:07:30.920]  But I don't need to see those those now represent my home screen and my experience way every experience with Apple
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:35.360]  You've only bought three movies from I know this can't that can't be true like if I go to
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:37.840]  like
[2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:43.440]  That absolutely can't be true, but it but that's what it looks like that's what it looks like because they only show you the three
[2:07:43.720 --> 2:07:51.000]  Let's see all movies. No, I have eight on here. You don't buy movies from iTunes. No, I rent them. Okay
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:57.040]  Yeah, and then the first movie I ever bought with iTunes right when the iTunes movie store launch was over
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:07:59.120]  There are our though, and that's still on here. I
[2:07:59.920 --> 2:08:04.280]  Have one called the happiest baby on the block, which was teaching us how to shish our baby
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:10.800]  Just leave and then cloud Atlas, which is my favorite movie also
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:19.180]  Do you buy a lot of movies I buy tons of movies I've got I've got like 300 items
[2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:24.460]  Well, why would you do that though? Because you can rent it any you know what because I kept running into the
[2:08:24.820 --> 2:08:30.140]  Problem where I'd rent the movie if they gave us 36 hours instead of 24 hours
[2:08:30.140 --> 2:08:37.220]  I would probably only own 100 movies instead of 300 but it got to the point where I had so many times where I'd
[2:08:37.220 --> 2:08:41.860]  Rended a movie and I was like I got to go to bed and I'd go to bed and then the next night
[2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:45.180]  It was already expired and then I'd have to rent it again
[2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:51.980]  And I share it out so Matt and even though the cost of two rentals is less than still less than the cost of buying it
[2:08:51.980 --> 2:08:57.340]  It's close enough that I just started buying and I yeah, I just buy whatever I want to watch for my tips
[2:08:57.340 --> 2:09:00.580]  And I get it and the hack around that was that you could pause it
[2:09:00.580 --> 2:09:06.900]  And just like leave your leave your Apple TV on and then just like you wouldn't be able to do anything else until you
[2:09:06.900 --> 2:09:10.700]  Unpause it that stopped working for me though, and I know it was still still yeah
[2:09:10.700 --> 2:09:15.740]  It was like I would just enter like an endless spinner where it would be like authorizing and the authorization would never stop
[2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:18.580]  So then you give up and hit menu and they're like this expired
[2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:28.260]  Yeah, so you know that's why if rentals had a bigger window like 48 hours or even I got I've always said 36 would do it
[2:09:28.260 --> 2:09:31.620]  Because 36 would let you watch the next night no matter when you start
[2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.580]  I'd have bought a lot if you were
[2:09:34.580 --> 2:09:40.180]  Do you happen to know what kind of a profit center is the rental is the movie rental store for Apple?
[2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:44.540]  I don't know exactly because they just lump it all together, but it's it is grown
[2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:52.380]  No, it is big like horse dead you is tracked how much it's it's just all lumped in together with the app store and stuff like and the music store and stuff like that
[2:09:52.380 --> 2:09:54.380]  But it's it is significant
[2:09:55.180 --> 2:10:01.860]  Anything that they do is insignificant compared to and I'm at this is great because I don't want to I'm not a financial guy
[2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:06.820]  You know like Apple did the finances last week in Guy and I didn't talk about him and you and I are going to talk about him
[2:10:06.820 --> 2:10:13.540]  But long story short the one thing that I think it's overlooked is everybody emphasizes that they're so lopsided in favor of
[2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:17.260]  The revenue from the iPhone because the iPhone is so humongous
[2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:27.900]  But the the the thing is is that everything else at Apple combined other than iPhone is has revenues that's more than the combined revenues of Facebook and Microsoft
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:36.700]  Well, so Apple's non iPhone business is huge and it just all of it any single part of that though
[2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:43.100]  Pales in comparison to the iPhone because the iPhone is like unfathomably big revenue and profit wise
[2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:46.220]  And I think that the iTunes stuff is definitely significant
[2:10:46.220 --> 2:10:49.420]  I don't think you know that nobody really talks about that being run as a
[2:10:49.940 --> 2:10:54.660]  Loss leader or break even anymore. I think it's pretty clear that they make money on that
[2:10:54.660 --> 2:10:59.340]  Yeah, I really hope that they can start breaking them out when they do do a cable packet
[2:10:59.340 --> 2:11:04.780]  You know a cable like package because that is an entirely separate business. I think if you're usurping a
[2:11:05.420 --> 2:11:07.420]  multi multi billion dollar
[2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:13.180]  Telecommunication's industry you should probably have to report the earnings from that I think so too
[2:11:13.180 --> 2:11:17.900]  But the the truth is even though is Apple even though Apple hides a lot of this stuff or not hides it
[2:11:17.900 --> 2:11:19.700]  But groups it all together so you can't break it down
[2:11:19.700 --> 2:11:26.660]  There's still a lot more transparent than some of their competitors like Amazon Amazon is just like we made money
[2:11:26.660 --> 2:11:34.180]  You know, here's how much screw Amazon for not having an app to let's hold hold a thought on that and let's let's let's come back to that
[2:11:34.180 --> 2:11:36.180]  I got to do this last
[2:11:36.180 --> 2:11:42.900]  This last sponsor and I'm very excited about this. I told you before brand new sponsor haven't sponsored us before it's a company called
[2:11:43.140 --> 2:11:45.140]  Wealthfront
[2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:47.140]  now Wealthfront is
[2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:54.540]  It's it's it's a way to make it easy for anyone to access world-class long term investment management
[2:11:54.700 --> 2:11:59.980]  It's an online automatic service that invests your money for you

[2:12:17.940 --> 2:12:23.580]  So in addition to charging one of the lowest fees in the industry and charging nothing at all for commissions
[2:12:23.660 --> 2:12:26.340]  It's always working to save you money
[2:12:27.540 --> 2:12:31.180]  To earn money on your investment and to save you money on your taxes
[2:12:31.340 --> 2:12:35.860]  It is transparent and accessible. You can view all of your accounts in one place
[2:12:35.860 --> 2:12:45.420]  Whether they are personal accounts joint accounts retirement accounts and you can see every trade that Wealthfront makes on your behalf in your dashboard
[2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:47.420]  Anywhere you go
[2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:52.140]  They've got all sorts of complicated, you know, they explain it. They go into detail about this
[2:12:52.140 --> 2:12:55.180]  I'm no investment. I just said that before almost by coincidence
[2:12:56.420 --> 2:13:00.460]  But here's the deal most of these places most places traditional places where you invest money
[2:13:01.540 --> 2:13:05.220]  Take at least one percent of whatever you invest with them as their fee
[2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:07.860]  A lot of them take up to three percent
[2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:13.220]  So with Wealthfront, here's what they take. It's just a flat one quarter of one percent
[2:13:13.780 --> 2:13:20.340]  That they call that 25 basis points. I didn't I didn't know what a basis point is before one quarter of one percent
[2:13:21.020 --> 2:13:26.020]  And it does not kick in until you have over $10,000 in there
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:29.860]  So you can do up to $10,000 in your Wealthfront account and they won't take anything
[2:13:29.860 --> 2:13:35.060]  They don't take any fees they only take one quarter of one percent on what's in there
[2:13:35.060 --> 2:13:37.060]  over $10,000
[2:13:37.300 --> 2:13:40.100]  Even better than that though for talk show listeners
[2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:47.060]  They have a promotion where if you go to Wealthfront.com slash the talk show
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:50.980]  And you sign up there you can even see it when you go to that page
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:53.780]  They have a special splash page go check it out for talk show listeners
[2:13:54.420 --> 2:13:59.980]  They up that to $15,000 so the first $15,000 you put your account no fees at all
[2:13:59.980 --> 2:14:02.460]  You don't pay anything no fees no commissions for life
[2:14:02.460 --> 2:14:05.140]  And then you only pay one quarter of percent after that
[2:14:06.740 --> 2:14:12.220]  They you know more or less they they have a strategy where they put all your money in index funds
[2:14:12.780 --> 2:14:16.540]  And a management they they move it around and try to be smart about it
[2:14:16.540 --> 2:14:18.500]  So it's not like they're you know putting it into you know
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.620]  Risky stuff. It's about as stable as it can be
[2:14:23.940 --> 2:14:29.300]  Sort of a conservative long-term growth strategy for your investment. I don't know shit about investments
[2:14:29.300 --> 2:14:31.300]  So this to me is very very intriguing

[2:15:25.540 --> 2:15:29.460]  Oh, seriously, I that's pretty much what they told me. Yeah
[2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:34.540]  Restrictions we one of their competitors in the robo advising
[2:15:35.140 --> 2:15:40.620]  Industry is our is a client of mine that FINRA SEC stuff is no joke man. Yeah
[2:15:41.300 --> 2:15:47.420]  Maybe I'd be funny if me and you went to prison together. I wouldn't mind it. I wouldn't mind it anywhere near as badly if you and I could go together
[2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:50.260]  Yeah, we would wear a matching eye patches
[2:15:50.260 --> 2:15:52.260]  I
[2:15:53.620 --> 2:15:58.380]  Feel like that's what you need to get through talking about Apple computers all day. Yeah, just to get through a stint
[2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:02.940]  Oh, I call her prison. I just need one buddy. Yeah. Oh God. I need a buddy
[2:16:05.940 --> 2:16:07.940]  What were we talking about before?
[2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:12.100]  Amazon Amazon those bastards
[2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:18.860]  Spiteful spiteful bastards. I feel like they've really up. They've taken it up a level by not doing it out
[2:16:18.860 --> 2:16:20.860]  Yeah, and it's funny because
[2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:23.860]  So I've got the Amazon prime
[2:16:25.060 --> 2:16:27.060]  Yeah, it's really
[2:16:27.060 --> 2:16:33.580]  It just feels spiteful and I knew it and I made sense to me before I had it the the fire the you have their their box
[2:16:33.580 --> 2:16:35.980]  No, I don't have their box and I don't want another box
[2:16:37.860 --> 2:16:43.220]  And and they didn't have a thing on the old Apple TV because the old Apple TV didn't really have an app store
[2:16:43.220 --> 2:16:44.540]  And they had to work out partnerships
[2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:50.340]  And I always just assumed that it's because they did the two companies don't like each other and they couldn't bear to work
[2:16:50.340 --> 2:16:51.100]  Something like this out
[2:16:51.100 --> 2:16:56.500]  But that once they had an app store Amazon would just build the app submit it to Apple and they wouldn't have to talk to Eddie
[2:16:56.500 --> 2:16:58.500]  Q or anything like that. There'd be no deal and
[2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:04.300]  And of course I would assume that they would set it up so that you can't sign up for Amazon prime
[2:17:04.380 --> 2:17:09.700]  Through your Apple TV because then they'd have to give Apple 30% you'd have to still have to go to Amazon
[2:17:09.700 --> 2:17:16.300]  dot com on some other device and sign up there to do the payment stuff and that if you wanted to buy a movie or something like that
[2:17:16.300 --> 2:17:18.620]  You'd have to do it on another device so that you don't
[2:17:19.220 --> 2:17:24.100]  You know Apple doesn't get their 30% totally understand that that level of spite
[2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:28.340]  But for the stuff that you get for free with your Amazon prime the fact that they don't have a cool app on this
[2:17:28.460 --> 2:17:34.740]  Makes me to make me angry and they've got really good content on their transparent was an amazing show
[2:17:34.740 --> 2:17:36.740]  And if there are a content studio
[2:17:36.740 --> 2:17:39.740]  If Amazon is a content studio
[2:17:39.740 --> 2:17:44.580]  Why the hell would they cut off a limb and not distribute it on? Probably the most
[2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:47.500]  viable content distribution mechanism
[2:17:48.260 --> 2:17:50.260]  that there is I
[2:17:51.700 --> 2:17:56.340]  Don't get it and I know that they want people to buy the fire TV and stuff like that
[2:17:56.340 --> 2:18:01.260]  And I'm sure people who are their most die hard users will and they have this great selling
[2:18:01.260 --> 2:18:04.820]  You know where they can promote it right on the home page of amazon.com and they do
[2:18:04.820 --> 2:18:11.740]  But I just don't see why they wouldn't want to be on on this device with an app
[2:18:11.740 --> 2:18:15.940]  Yeah, why are there die hard Amazon fans that will only buy Amazon?
[2:18:17.220 --> 2:18:19.220]  hardware and
[2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:21.820]  Use Amazon software. It doesn't make sense to me
[2:18:22.820 --> 2:18:30.860]  I don't know and the fact that you still can do it by going to your phone or your iPad and using the app that they do make for those devices
[2:18:30.860 --> 2:18:32.860]  And then airplane it to your Apple TV
[2:18:32.860 --> 2:18:37.860]  It's like you're not keeping me from watching it through my Apple TV
[2:18:37.860 --> 2:18:42.940]  You're just making me use a worse interface and a more brit one that you know
[2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:49.020]  Sometimes gets disconnected because it's you know, airplane is in his rock solid is just playing it right through an app on the device
[2:18:56.340 --> 2:19:00.780]  Yeah, I hate those apps where you have to actually keep this screen active
[2:19:00.780 --> 2:19:03.980]  In order to air play out
[2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:07.100]  It's so dumb who designed that
[2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:12.740]  And every time my every time you have TV turns on and the video stops
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:15.140]  I know I make someone throw my phone at the TV
[2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:19.700]  Exactly
[2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:23.540]  We have a couple minutes left. I want to bring up your newest thing
[2:19:24.140 --> 2:19:26.140]  Which is computer show
[2:19:26.140 --> 2:19:27.540]  Yes
[2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:34.060]  So you go to number one. This is a wonderful domain. You just go to computer.show. Sure
[2:19:35.500 --> 2:19:38.220]  It's almost like it's almost like the URL is
[2:19:39.100 --> 2:19:43.540]  Was like picked by somebody who doesn't understand the internet like how a web browser work?
[2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:53.580]  What's the host of computer show is the host name is Gary Fabert and he's played by played by an actor or comedian
[2:19:54.140 --> 2:19:56.140]  Yeah, Rob Betaker
[2:19:56.140 --> 2:19:58.140]  Who is amazing
[2:19:59.060 --> 2:20:02.180]  So I don't want to spoil too much. I want to be able to talk about this
[2:20:02.900 --> 2:20:07.260]  So you linked to it on on Daring Fireball. She's extremely awesome
[2:20:07.260 --> 2:20:12.580]  Well, and hopefully a lot of people who are listening have already seen it before we talk about it because it's some of it
[2:20:12.580 --> 2:20:15.100]  I feel like it that never would be spoiled
[2:20:15.100 --> 2:20:19.820]  But the basic premise though is that it's it's a show and I used to watch these shows
[2:20:19.820 --> 2:20:25.540]  It is like a PBS show from 1983 about computers
[2:20:25.940 --> 2:20:34.540]  Yeah, except that the companies and products who are on the show are real companies and products in today's computing world
[2:20:35.020 --> 2:20:37.180]  Yes
[2:20:37.180 --> 2:20:39.180]  That's the that's the high concept
[2:20:39.740 --> 2:20:41.740]  The high conceit of the show
[2:20:41.740 --> 2:20:49.340]  So you know, like you get to watch a host and co-host from a technology talk show from 1983
[2:20:49.980 --> 2:20:52.740]  Stumble through understanding a technology from today
[2:20:53.380 --> 2:21:00.700]  Which is a pretty simple like straightforward pitch, you know, but when you know executed but executed
[2:21:01.740 --> 2:21:04.540]  with an eye towards like detail and
[2:21:05.500 --> 2:21:07.740]  Authenticity, it's not just an SNL sketch
[2:21:07.740 --> 2:21:11.300]  We really wanted to make it feel like it was in that world and then Rob
[2:21:11.820 --> 2:21:18.220]  Betick or who brings life into that character like you wouldn't believe it just it just was really like a really fun
[2:21:18.700 --> 2:21:21.980]  It was a really fun thing. He's amazing and
[2:21:23.100 --> 2:21:28.220]  It the first episode premiered at XOXO last month
[2:21:29.340 --> 2:21:35.060]  It was after there was you guys had a live episode of you look nice today, which was great and the crowd was really into it
[2:21:35.060 --> 2:21:41.820]  And it was in good mood and then afterwards you premiered this and it I mean it
[2:21:41.820 --> 2:21:47.860]  I'm not just, you know blowing smoke up up your beautiful beautiful butt, but it blew the roof off the dump
[2:21:47.860 --> 2:21:50.460]  I mean, I mean people went nuts
[2:21:51.460 --> 2:21:56.500]  Is that the first time you did a you've had a thing premiere in front of a live audience?
[2:21:56.980 --> 2:22:01.620]  Definitely I mean yeah since film school like film school already had to show something in front of an audience
[2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:07.300]  But that was yeah, I never had to all my stuff goes out into the internet and into a vacuum and I never
[2:22:08.020 --> 2:22:10.980]  Really can accept for like Twitter as a sounding board, but
[2:22:12.420 --> 2:22:20.420]  It was just such a good experience. It was it was the perfect audience to premiere it for because they're right in that world of like tech slash
[2:22:21.220 --> 2:22:23.220]  having a sense of humor and and
[2:22:24.100 --> 2:22:26.500]  You know character. Did you feel pressure?
[2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:33.300]  Following up what I thought was very clearly a very very good live episode of you look nice today
[2:22:33.940 --> 2:22:38.500]  Totally, I could have like killed it. I could have like crushed the mood entirely
[2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:42.340]  And also like I felt a little bit bad that
[2:22:43.700 --> 2:22:47.060]  Because I was gonna I had asked the Andes if I could premiere
[2:22:47.860 --> 2:22:50.260]  If I could premiere the episode
[2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:55.460]  Out like their video, you know in one of the slots if there was an open slot for their video
[2:22:56.660 --> 2:22:58.660]  shorts program and
[2:22:58.660 --> 2:23:01.860]  Andy was so into the idea that he was like oh
[2:23:02.580 --> 2:23:05.380]  You could go right up. You could go up right after you look nice today
[2:23:05.380 --> 2:23:08.260]  And I felt really bad and I also felt there's a huge
[2:23:08.980 --> 2:23:10.660]  elevated stakes
[2:23:10.660 --> 2:23:15.380]  But yeah, it's it totally went well and it was you know so fun and but the reception
[2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:22.580]  From having shown them on the internet has been so positive that we're really like we're gearing up to do more of them
[2:23:22.980 --> 2:23:24.980]  What what is the hold up to do more?
[2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:28.980]  Well, they were actually quite, you know resource intensive to do
[2:23:30.340 --> 2:23:34.340]  To produce the three episodes that we did and one of them we've had to withhold because
[2:23:35.700 --> 2:23:40.660]  The the subject of the show that the guest on the show was not
[2:23:40.660 --> 2:23:45.780]  The PR person behind that company was not super amenable to
[2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:51.380]  How it went down? Yeah, well not not how it went down
[2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:54.660]  But just they were uncomfortable with the whole idea of the humor of
[2:23:55.940 --> 2:24:00.340]  Of the concept, but so we didn't know what they were getting into beforehand
[2:24:00.820 --> 2:24:02.660]  Yeah, it was weird, you know
[2:24:02.660 --> 2:24:04.660]  There's the backstory is that
[2:24:04.660 --> 2:24:10.260]  You know without giving away too much the backstory is that this person was uncomfortable a little bit or that
[2:24:11.140 --> 2:24:14.420]  The guest wasn't but the PR company was and so
[2:24:15.140 --> 2:24:17.140]  In order to get that person on as a guest
[2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:19.780]  to like follow through
[2:24:20.020 --> 2:24:25.380]  The PR company we basically said listen you have the right to pull the episode if you don't like it
[2:24:25.380 --> 2:24:27.380]  Because I was so confident that it would go well
[2:24:27.700 --> 2:24:31.380]  And then it went well and we made a really funny episode out of it and then PR company
[2:24:31.380 --> 2:24:36.020]  It you know when right before we launched the the show was just like no
[2:24:36.100 --> 2:24:38.740]  We're gonna we're gonna exercise that right and it's like
[2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:44.100]  Well, we'll we'll sit this round out and it really sucked someday. It'll see the light of day. Hopefully
[2:24:44.820 --> 2:24:48.420]  What I love about you. I love about you that you are you're such a
[2:24:49.780 --> 2:24:56.740]  I'm sure you might have gone through other emotions earlier, but you you say this and there's no sense of bitterness in your voice at all
[2:24:57.220 --> 2:24:59.780]  Well, you know because when something like this happens
[2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:01.780]  I just have the sense that they'll get
[2:25:02.740 --> 2:25:04.740]  Whatever
[2:25:06.740 --> 2:25:10.340]  I think we made something really good and they could have gotten a lot of benefit from it
[2:25:10.340 --> 2:25:14.580]  But if they choose to not participate in that benefit, then that's their deal
[2:25:14.980 --> 2:25:21.940]  But the important part is that we're making more of them. They were we're gonna get you know different partners on board and
[2:25:22.900 --> 2:25:24.900]  involve you know
[2:25:24.900 --> 2:25:30.900]  In involved different money people involve different start-ups and guests and corporate
[2:25:31.540 --> 2:25:38.180]  You know sponsors and things and so really like at this phase we're gearing up to do more episodes in if there are any
[2:25:38.900 --> 2:25:40.900]  You know I extend this
[2:25:40.900 --> 2:25:46.100]  To your audience if there are start-ups out there that feel like they're gonna be perfectly suited to
[2:25:46.740 --> 2:25:53.220]  Somehow being featured on the show then definitely get in touch. One of the things I love about it is that the premise is
[2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:55.220]  is
[2:25:55.220 --> 2:26:01.060]  Sort of the basic premise is very easy. It's modern technology as seen through the eyes of a
[2:26:01.620 --> 2:26:03.620]  1983 computer technology show
[2:26:04.740 --> 2:26:12.500]  But after that, it's all hand-wavy and there's never any explanation as to how this could be happening because
[2:26:13.540 --> 2:26:17.460]  The hosts of the show clearly haven't been around since 1983
[2:26:17.460 --> 2:26:22.420]  Right, I mean he looks like he's about my age, so he was about 10 in 1983
[2:26:24.820 --> 2:26:27.780]  There's no explanation and there's no no no argument
[2:26:27.780 --> 2:26:30.980]  There's no sense that there was some sort of time machine or anything like that
[2:26:31.060 --> 2:26:40.580]  It's just this inexplicable hand-wavy mismatch of a host and a show and and the set design and the camera angles
[2:26:40.580 --> 2:26:46.580]  Combined with modern technology and then the best part and this is again
[2:26:46.580 --> 2:26:52.340]  It speaks to the like you said like the production cost that go into this is that when like it's demo time
[2:26:53.140 --> 2:26:56.180]  The demos are done on like an Apple 2e
[2:26:58.340 --> 2:27:04.180]  Yeah, I think it would be this day like I am comfortable showing an iPhone in the world of computer
[2:27:04.180 --> 2:27:13.380]  A computer show. I would not be comfortable showing a MacBook or an iMac. Well, then there's a demo on an iPhone on the one episode and
[2:27:14.660 --> 2:27:16.660]  What's this a Gary right?
[2:27:16.660 --> 2:27:18.660]  Gary calls it a calculator
[2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:23.620]  Look at the racquetball in that tiny calculator
[2:27:26.180 --> 2:27:28.180]  And he's not that impressed by it
[2:27:28.180 --> 2:27:35.380]  That's that's what kills me is that he's really into computers and he's he's like an enthusiast as to the Apple 2e
[2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:43.140]  But when he sees an iPhone he's he's not impressed by it. That's right. I mean, it's like showing it's like the opening scene from 2001
[2:27:43.460 --> 2:27:44.980]  Like
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:48.580]  Ultimately how impressed are those apes gonna be why that monolith?
[2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:55.860]  Right or not that different or if you gave one of those apes an iPad pro they would just use it to
[2:27:55.860 --> 2:27:58.820]  feed over the hell out of the rival tribe
[2:28:00.340 --> 2:28:03.100]  Yeah, and I look see oh yeah, I mean you hit on that
[2:28:03.100 --> 2:28:06.980]  We never want to explain the the the mechanics of the world
[2:28:07.860 --> 2:28:15.060]  Because it's so much foot more fun not to but the way I think of it is like it's kind of like one of those a movie
[2:28:16.660 --> 2:28:18.660]  Plot where somebody
[2:28:18.980 --> 2:28:22.260]  magically gets transported into a TV show that they're watching
[2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:26.260]  Uh, you know, and they'll they'll appear into like in the
[2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:32.740]  In the fictional fictional world of the the TV show that they're watching right in a question how that happened
[2:28:32.980 --> 2:28:38.100]  It was just supernatural and so that's the that's kind of the same logic in this in this universe
[2:28:38.180 --> 2:28:42.180]  Your brain fills in the gaps with like a sort of touchy feeling well
[2:28:42.340 --> 2:28:48.980]  It's you know somehow somehow this happened and you accept it in a way that if it was explained your brain would be like what that makes no sense
[2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:55.140]  If you explained it your brain would reject the explanation as having made no sense because there's no way that this could make sense
[2:28:55.140 --> 2:29:00.740]  And if you don't explain it this is what makes this is what makes it funny to me is that your brain
[2:29:00.900 --> 2:29:02.900]  Just fills it in with okay, whatever
[2:29:02.900 --> 2:29:06.660]  I'll accept this for now. Where are they gonna do and then oh my god, this is hilarious
[2:29:07.220 --> 2:29:09.940]  Yeah, how did you make the graphics for the Apple 2e stuff?
[2:29:12.180 --> 2:29:16.100]  That was done by our editor Zena Gray who was
[2:29:16.100 --> 2:29:18.100]  um
[2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:21.300]  She was wonderful to work with and she she just did um
[2:29:22.180 --> 2:29:24.180]  Really cool just retro graphics
[2:29:24.820 --> 2:29:31.860]  And comped him in the screen convincingly and then all of the motion logos at the head of the show and everything
[2:29:32.180 --> 2:29:39.060]  We're done by just this guy found on the internet who I'd seen who had found on Vimeo his work was just so stellar and he did this
[2:29:39.620 --> 2:29:45.380]  The that arrow of graphics better than anybody else. I'd seen named Jared Hagerman and uh
[2:29:45.380 --> 2:29:50.900]  Like that's my favorite kind of thing collaboration where you just find somebody on the internet and you end up working with them
[2:29:50.900 --> 2:29:56.500]  For a really long time and you never actually meet them face-to-face. Is is he like a younger person who
[2:29:56.980 --> 2:30:04.180]  Just has a fondness for that era of motion graphics or was he somebody who is in the motion graphics business at the time?
[2:30:04.820 --> 2:30:06.820]  No, I'm pretty sure that he's just
[2:30:08.020 --> 2:30:10.260]  No, that he's a young person. I like I don't know
[2:30:10.260 --> 2:30:14.340]  But I'm pretty sure that he's a young person who just like gets the aesthetic like so well
[2:30:14.340 --> 2:30:19.620]  It's it is as somebody who grew up in that era and was like a media obsessive
[2:30:20.180 --> 2:30:25.700]  And I remember even thinking like with some of those old you know like the old CBS logo and stuff like that and the motion like that
[2:30:25.700 --> 2:30:31.940]  What was that CBS one like special presentation? Yeah, don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't yeah, right
[2:30:33.300 --> 2:30:35.300]  The special presentation thing
[2:30:35.940 --> 2:30:39.700]  I remember thinking like that maybe like once once I'd seen it a couple times
[2:30:39.700 --> 2:30:40.500]  I remember thinking wait
[2:30:40.500 --> 2:30:47.780]  How the hell did they make that right because it doesn't make any sense that anybody could make that by hand the way they do and draw an animation and
[2:30:50.100 --> 2:30:55.780]  The integrity of the that style of graphic and the computer show is just a hundred percent
[2:30:55.860 --> 2:30:57.860]  It is exactly
[2:30:57.860 --> 2:30:59.300]  If I didn't know better
[2:30:59.300 --> 2:31:03.380]  I didn't think that somehow you found it in in 30 year old footage
[2:31:03.700 --> 2:31:08.980]  Yeah, it would be fun to like go back and use all the tools that they did like the the chiron or
[2:31:08.980 --> 2:31:11.220]  There was something called a squeezoo
[2:31:12.020 --> 2:31:16.340]  With a joystick like broadcast stations would use something called a squeezoom
[2:31:16.340 --> 2:31:22.260]  Which was like a joystick where you could like basically just fly the rectangle of the video frame around in
[2:31:23.060 --> 2:31:25.060]  two-dimensional space and
[2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:27.940]  Do page peels and stuff like that
[2:31:28.180 --> 2:31:35.380]  But ultimately the way to reproduce it now is just you use after effects, but you do it like really like specifically in handcraft
[2:31:36.100 --> 2:31:37.780]  the look
[2:31:37.780 --> 2:31:42.180]  It's just it just feels exactly right and it doesn't come across as
[2:31:42.900 --> 2:31:47.140]  caricature it's not caricaturing the style. It is it is exactly
[2:31:48.660 --> 2:31:51.620]  lovingly in in the same serious tone
[2:31:52.740 --> 2:31:55.460]  Thank you. Well the the most fun for me is that
[2:31:56.260 --> 2:32:02.580]  The original program that we're referencing is called the computer chronicles and it was hosted and started by a guy named Stuart
[2:32:02.580 --> 2:32:08.900]  Shafe and he had you know, he had tweeted that he saw the show and I told him I asked him
[2:32:08.900 --> 2:32:11.300]  You know, would you be on some time and he said totally so
[2:32:12.020 --> 2:32:17.060]  That that will be a dream come true. Oh my god. That is so great. That's
[2:32:18.420 --> 2:32:23.860]  That is absolutely amazing. Are there episodes of the computer chronicles on YouTube? Oh, yeah
[2:32:24.100 --> 2:32:28.420]  Just search for it. There's the whole the whole catalog is there it went from 83 through
[2:32:29.380 --> 2:32:31.380]  mid 90s, I think
[2:32:31.380 --> 2:32:33.380]  Excellent
[2:32:33.780 --> 2:32:35.780]  Anything else that you want to promote
[2:32:36.740 --> 2:32:40.980]  No, no, just um, I won't promote you because you're my friend
[2:32:43.060 --> 2:32:45.060]  Everybody should listen to the talk show
[2:32:45.060 --> 2:32:46.580]  Redairy fireball
[2:32:47.140 --> 2:32:50.020]  Well, you know what people should do if I'm gonna take a moment of self-promotion
[2:32:50.020 --> 2:32:53.620]  Go into your overcast app if you're using overcast and
[2:32:54.260 --> 2:32:56.820]  What do you do that shows in there? You recommend them or something?
[2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:02.980]  I don't know. I don't well go in there and recommend the talk show or promote it or something
[2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:06.180]  You can do in there because it what makes the only thing that makes me mad is a couple weeks ago
[2:33:06.180 --> 2:33:10.340]  We're Marco and I were talking about this hello internet show with the
[2:33:10.900 --> 2:33:13.300]  CDP gray and and Brady
[2:33:14.900 --> 2:33:19.140]  Harren Iran I'm not quite sure how to pronounce his surname, but anyway next thing you know
[2:33:20.100 --> 2:33:23.380]  I got all these emails from people saying why I never heard of that show it is amazing
[2:33:23.380 --> 2:33:26.740]  I love it and next thing you know, it's like the number one show and overcast
[2:33:26.900 --> 2:33:29.940]  They even jumped ahead of ATP, but it jumped ahead of my show too
[2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:36.740]  I just I just feel like well, you know, how about we you know, how about we put the talk show up there. Yeah, I get a little love
[2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:39.140]  Yeah, for daddy
[2:33:39.140 --> 2:33:41.140]  everybody
[2:33:42.740 --> 2:33:50.100]  Anyway, Adam Lisa Gore. Thank you so much for your generous time. Thanks for having me. Oh, this is really fun
[2:33:50.100 --> 2:33:54.180]  When do you think when is there a is there a schedule for more computer shows or is it yeah?
[2:33:54.180 --> 2:33:59.380]  We're gonna we're gonna try to shoot them in like early next year like February and then spend a while
[2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:02.740]  You know, we're doing it like kind of more like closer to a real show
[2:34:03.780 --> 2:34:06.980]  So there's writing and pre-production post-production that
[2:34:07.940 --> 2:34:15.060]  Has to be done. Yeah, and so these are sort of like like in the modern era where shows are sort of you know
[2:34:15.060 --> 2:34:20.820]  They're not 30 30 minutes long. It's sort of like a two-episode pilot. Right. Yeah
[2:34:20.820 --> 2:34:27.460]  And now people know exactly what they're getting into yeah, and we'll extend that in different directions
[2:34:27.460 --> 2:34:31.540]  We'll come up with new segments and I don't know if there's any way I can help
[2:34:32.420 --> 2:34:37.540]  I would love that. I know why I need you to be on as a guest. Oh, it's my dream
[2:34:37.540 --> 2:34:44.180]  I'll just hang it up after I'm on the computer. We'll do it Adam. Thank you. Thanks, Sean
