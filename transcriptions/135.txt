[00:00.000 --> 00:02.780]  All right, Adam, before we get into the show proper,
[00:02.780 --> 00:05.100]  I'm gonna send you, right now,
[00:05.100 --> 00:08.820]  I'm gonna send you a photograph I took from my desk today.
[00:08.820 --> 00:11.580]  This was hours ago, you'll see it, it was daylight.
[00:11.580 --> 00:14.300]  This was the view from my desk at my home office.
[00:14.300 --> 00:15.140]  Okay.
[00:15.140 --> 00:16.900]  It's at the back of our house,
[00:16.900 --> 00:18.700]  it overlooks a little courtyard,
[00:18.700 --> 00:21.300]  and our rear neighbors across the courtyard
[00:21.300 --> 00:24.460]  were having some, are having some home repairs done.
[00:24.460 --> 00:25.280]  Okay.
[00:25.280 --> 00:26.280]  It's coming.
[00:30.840 --> 00:31.680]  It's coming.
[00:31.680 --> 00:32.520]  I'm so excited.
[00:34.320 --> 00:35.160]  It's going.
[00:35.160 --> 00:36.480]  It's going through Skype?
[00:36.480 --> 00:38.520]  No, no, no, I'm sending it as an iMessage.
[00:38.520 --> 00:39.560]  Oh, okay.
[00:39.560 --> 00:40.540]  Keep it secure.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.800]  All right, it says that it sent.
[00:45.960 --> 00:46.800]  There it is.
[00:50.240 --> 00:52.920]  Now, I need you to realize that the guy,
[00:52.920 --> 00:57.920]  the top guy is not, that is not a deck
[00:59.780 --> 01:00.860]  that is just a little,
[01:00.860 --> 01:03.340]  sort of like a little ledge outside the window.
[01:03.340 --> 01:04.180]  Yeah.
[01:05.340 --> 01:08.180]  Oh my God, what is he doing?
[01:08.180 --> 01:09.420]  That doesn't seem safe.
[01:09.420 --> 01:11.940]  It doesn't seem safe at all.
[01:11.940 --> 01:14.540]  This is, this is at least, I don't know,
[01:14.540 --> 01:17.220]  the third floor, the fourth floor, it's pretty high up.
[01:17.220 --> 01:18.620]  And the other guy's on two ladders,
[01:18.620 --> 01:20.380]  he's straddling two ladders.
[01:20.380 --> 01:24.420]  That's like a ripped pants Harold Lloyd gag in the making.
[01:26.900 --> 01:29.100]  There is, if you look, it's hard to see
[01:29.100 --> 01:30.980]  because it's like the iPhone kind of focused
[01:30.980 --> 01:31.940]  on the screen in my window.
[01:31.940 --> 01:34.620]  But if you look, there is sort of like a blue rope
[01:34.620 --> 01:37.220]  going to the roof of the house.
[01:37.220 --> 01:40.100]  But the rope is actually connected to the other ladder
[01:40.100 --> 01:41.260]  that isn't being used.
[01:41.260 --> 01:43.980]  So it's like, there's a ladder that has
[01:43.980 --> 01:46.980]  like a safety harness, but the guy does not.
[01:46.980 --> 01:47.820]  Oh God.
[01:47.820 --> 01:52.820]  Oh, these are some real, real morons.
[01:54.060 --> 01:55.840]  Oh, did you just stare for like an hour
[01:55.840 --> 01:57.000]  waiting for them to fall?
[01:58.680 --> 02:00.380]  I had to close the window.
[02:00.380 --> 02:01.900]  I could not, I couldn't get any work done.
[02:01.900 --> 02:06.040]  My palms, my palms, my palms were sweating
[02:06.040 --> 02:09.540]  such that I could have cured the drought in California.
[02:09.540 --> 02:10.420]  What were they doing?
[02:10.420 --> 02:13.940]  They're ripping up the roof or something.
[02:13.940 --> 02:16.180]  I guess they're retiling the roof or something.
[02:16.180 --> 02:17.740]  They're doing, they're just doing work on the roof
[02:17.740 --> 02:20.820]  or whatever, but the way that they are on these ladders
[02:20.820 --> 02:23.300]  does not, does not seem safe.
[02:23.300 --> 02:24.500]  No, that's not good.
[02:24.500 --> 02:26.780]  That's not OSHA standards.
[02:26.780 --> 02:28.620]  That's not the code.
[02:28.620 --> 02:30.100]  The guy, the one guy.
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.380]  And he wasn't just straddling those two ladders
[02:32.380 --> 02:33.360]  for a second or two.
[02:33.360 --> 02:36.100]  He, whatever he was doing up there
[02:36.100 --> 02:38.800]  was one foot on one ladder and one on another.
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.900]  I felt like I was watching a Chaplin movie.
[02:40.900 --> 02:45.900]  And my fear was, I was just feared for their lives.
[02:47.780 --> 02:49.580]  And then apparently, then they started,
[02:49.580 --> 02:51.340]  they got into an argument with apparently
[02:51.340 --> 02:54.540]  a rival contractor who's doing what appears
[02:54.540 --> 02:56.660]  to be some other job on the same house.
[02:56.660 --> 02:59.920]  But they're clearly not colleagues.
[02:59.920 --> 03:02.380]  And they got into an argument, but it's like
[03:02.380 --> 03:03.920]  the one group that's in the argument
[03:03.920 --> 03:06.100]  is 30 feet up in the air on a ladder.
[03:06.100 --> 03:11.100]  I don't feel like that's the time to have an argument.
[03:12.820 --> 03:15.740]  Yeah, they get into beefs, those construction crews.
[03:15.740 --> 03:19.940]  They're, it's very broey, that culture.
[03:20.840 --> 03:23.380]  We've had some work done on our house recently.
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.540]  And if the crew doesn't like somebody on the, you know,
[03:28.540 --> 03:30.220]  they'll do, they'll do pranks.
[03:30.220 --> 03:33.900]  They'll do some fraternity shit stuff.
[03:33.900 --> 03:36.880]  For example.
[03:37.900 --> 03:40.460]  I don't know, you know, like hiding a guy's keys.
[03:40.460 --> 03:43.760]  For like hours, you know, not like,
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.980]  and they're, these are grown men.
[03:44.980 --> 03:47.220]  These are like men in their 40s and 50s.
[03:49.860 --> 03:52.120]  I'm kind of glad that I don't work in an industry
[03:52.120 --> 03:54.960]  where it's, it would be, it's commonplace
[03:54.960 --> 03:56.140]  for people to hide your keys.
[03:56.140 --> 03:59.500]  Because I lose, I lose my keys frequently enough on my own.
[03:59.500 --> 04:03.540]  Yeah, that's just kind of permissible.
[04:06.200 --> 04:09.440]  Adam, so we talk about lots of stuff.
[04:09.440 --> 04:10.680]  We always talk about lots of stuff.
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.120]  But I mean, the big thing is Apple TV.
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.680]  So the last episode of this show, I did it with Guy English.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.960]  We were really just like, I forget when we recorded, Friday?
[04:21.960 --> 04:24.560]  Yeah, so I think we, I'd only had it 24 hours.
[04:24.560 --> 04:27.520]  And Guy had the dev kit one for a while,
[04:27.520 --> 04:28.880]  but it was really only hooked up.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.320]  Like the dev kit thing really wasn't that useful
[04:31.320 --> 04:33.080]  because the app store wasn't live in it
[04:33.080 --> 04:34.440]  or anything like that till Friday.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.900]  So in terms of like getting like a sense
[04:35.900 --> 04:37.200]  of the whole experience,
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.880]  it was relatively new for both of us.
[04:39.880 --> 04:40.720]  Right.
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.600]  And so we've had another week.
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.660]  Yeah, and I've been with it for about 72 hours now.
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.160]  So I've done my fair share of poking around,
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.920]  mostly partially in prep for talking with you about it.
[04:55.920 --> 04:58.800]  I feel like that's, I kind of have to go through the,
[04:58.800 --> 05:00.740]  you know, kick the tires and take it through its,
[05:00.740 --> 05:02.380]  run it through its paces.
[05:02.380 --> 05:05.160]  Right now I'm, oh, I brought it into the office.
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.720]  I brought my Apple TV into the office
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.580]  and I have it hooked up to a TV here
[05:08.580 --> 05:12.560]  so I can go through all the UI as we talk about it.
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.800]  And right now I'm doing like a little science experiment
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.520]  with the reflection as I, you know, in the icons.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.920]  What do you call the?
[05:21.920 --> 05:22.760]  Refraction?
[05:22.760 --> 05:23.880]  I don't know what you call that.
[05:23.880 --> 05:25.540]  Well, the reflection,
[05:25.540 --> 05:30.120]  because there's a light source reflected in the pain
[05:30.120 --> 05:33.160]  and it's striking me and I'm using
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.800]  a different reflective surface
[05:34.800 --> 05:39.020]  and I'm using the reflective part of the remote,
[05:39.020 --> 05:41.120]  of the real remote, because I want to make sure.
[05:41.120 --> 05:42.420]  Okay, yeah, it does.
[05:42.420 --> 05:47.420]  It didn't, like the way that when you turn the pane
[05:47.440 --> 05:52.040]  to the left or the right, that the reflection goes off to,
[05:52.040 --> 05:56.380]  you know, it goes off to the left or the right
[05:56.380 --> 05:58.580]  the way it would in the real world,
[05:58.580 --> 06:01.020]  obviously to mimic the physical universe.
[06:01.020 --> 06:03.100]  You mean like when you just sort of jiggle your thumb
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.620]  on the touch pad a little bit,
[06:04.620 --> 06:06.500]  just to make the currently selected item
[06:06.500 --> 06:08.980]  sort of rotate around?
[06:08.980 --> 06:09.820]  Exactly, yeah.
[06:09.820 --> 06:11.900]  Like it pivots, it pivots slightly.
[06:11.900 --> 06:14.580]  That's right, it pivots and it also sort of pans over.
[06:14.580 --> 06:17.540]  It's like really cool, like however they rigged this,
[06:17.540 --> 06:20.180]  it's almost like on a ball joint.
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.820]  Yeah, that's a good way to put it, right.
[06:22.820 --> 06:26.300]  So like as if it's like sitting on a bowling ball
[06:26.300 --> 06:29.120]  and you push it back and forth
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.060]  and it reflects the light source behind you,
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.140]  which is sort of a soft light bank.
[06:34.740 --> 06:37.100]  God, they're just getting really good at this stuff,
[06:37.100 --> 06:40.460]  you know, mimicking the physical universe
[06:40.460 --> 06:42.520]  in a way that, of course, it makes sense.
[06:42.520 --> 06:46.700]  We kind of had to like pull it back and go flat for a while
[06:46.700 --> 06:50.340]  while they got better at doing this kind of stuff,
[06:50.340 --> 06:52.460]  this kind of visual effect kind of stuff.
[06:52.460 --> 06:55.140]  Because before, you know, you look at like aqua
[06:56.020 --> 06:59.060]  and it looked kind of cool for the time,
[06:59.060 --> 07:00.660]  but it looked like, you know,
[07:00.660 --> 07:02.960]  relative to the physical world, it looked like garbage.
[07:02.960 --> 07:04.560]  It was dumb.
[07:04.560 --> 07:06.400]  But this doesn't look dumb, I don't think.
[07:06.400 --> 07:07.600]  No, I like it a lot.
[07:09.500 --> 07:10.340]  I do like the way it looks,
[07:10.340 --> 07:12.340]  but it's the feel of it that I really like.
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.900]  And if there's anything that I feel is just,
[07:14.900 --> 07:19.580]  and I've read a lot more other people's reviews of it
[07:19.580 --> 07:22.620]  since, you know, since I spoke about it on the last show.
[07:22.620 --> 07:24.020]  And it does seem mixed.
[07:24.020 --> 07:27.300]  It seems like, to me, a lot of people are,
[07:27.300 --> 07:28.500]  it seems like I'm in the minority.
[07:28.500 --> 07:31.780]  It seems like a lot of the overall first week feedback
[07:31.780 --> 07:34.820]  is a lot more negative than I think it should be.
[07:34.820 --> 07:37.080]  Yeah, it's like way, way more controversial
[07:37.080 --> 07:39.100]  than you would ever think it would be.
[07:39.100 --> 07:41.540]  It seems like a minority
[07:41.540 --> 07:45.660]  that's actually just really stoked about this thing.
[07:45.660 --> 07:47.040]  And I'm definitely on your side.
[07:47.040 --> 07:48.460]  I think this is magical.
[07:48.460 --> 07:51.660]  And I've been a Apple TV,
[07:51.660 --> 07:54.720]  huge proponent of Apple TV since the first version.
[07:55.820 --> 07:59.780]  So I've watched it, you know, I've owned a bunch of them.
[07:59.780 --> 08:00.620]  I like-
[08:00.620 --> 08:01.800]  Four, I've owned all four.
[08:01.800 --> 08:02.640]  I've owned all four.
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.180]  Yeah, definitely, I've owned all four.
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.580]  And like, you know, kind of to the point of fixation
[08:08.580 --> 08:12.500]  of fixation where like I would get one for,
[08:12.500 --> 08:15.660]  they're cheap enough now, you can get one for each TV.
[08:16.960 --> 08:18.720]  And like, you know, we have two TV, you know,
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.180]  two in the office and actually four in the office.
[08:23.180 --> 08:25.740]  But Jesse Char reminded me today on Twitter
[08:25.740 --> 08:28.340]  that I was the guy who would,
[08:28.340 --> 08:31.240]  when the Apple TV first came out, version one,
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.500]  I would actually travel with it.
[08:32.500 --> 08:35.800]  Like if we would all, you know, come to a conference,
[08:35.800 --> 08:38.200]  we'd come to a conference in San Francisco
[08:38.200 --> 08:39.500]  and I would bring mine with me
[08:39.500 --> 08:43.620]  and hook it up to the hotel TV just in case.
[08:43.620 --> 08:45.740]  And I kept my whole movie library on there
[08:45.740 --> 08:50.340]  because there was no real cloud service kind of stuff yet.
[08:51.480 --> 08:54.220]  But I hacked mine.
[08:54.220 --> 08:56.620]  Back then you used this, what was it?
[08:56.620 --> 08:58.460]  Fire something.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.300]  Firewire.
[08:59.300 --> 09:00.120]  Do you remember what it was?
[09:00.120 --> 09:00.960]  What was it?
[09:00.960 --> 09:01.800]  Was it Firewire?
[09:01.800 --> 09:02.620]  No, not Firewire.
[09:02.620 --> 09:06.140]  No, there's a company, a software company
[09:06.140 --> 09:09.740]  that basically sold a hack for the Apple TV.
[09:09.740 --> 09:12.580]  Oh, I know what you mean.
[09:12.580 --> 09:13.980]  I forget what it was called.
[09:15.500 --> 09:17.660]  This is why we should have a live audience.
[09:19.000 --> 09:19.940]  I know what you mean now.
[09:19.940 --> 09:22.780]  And the fact was, really, I would just say,
[09:22.780 --> 09:25.540]  going back, zoom out to the big, you know, big picture.
[09:25.540 --> 09:29.200]  There's really only been three Apple TVs.
[09:29.200 --> 09:31.440]  The first one, which ran like,
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.060]  it was like Mac OS X 10.4 under the hood.
[09:35.060 --> 09:36.420]  It didn't look like a Mac,
[09:36.420 --> 09:37.940]  but if you took it apart
[09:37.940 --> 09:39.420]  and did the equivalent of jailbreaking it,
[09:39.420 --> 09:43.980]  you could figure out it was an Intel x86 Mac,
[09:43.980 --> 09:47.220]  more or less like a really low-end Mac mini
[09:47.220 --> 09:49.240]  running a version of OS X,
[09:50.620 --> 09:53.700]  but with this custom TV interface.
[09:53.700 --> 09:55.580]  Right, and sometimes if something went wrong,
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.740]  you had to surface like the BDOS or whatever.
[09:59.740 --> 10:00.580]  You could see like the...
[10:00.580 --> 10:02.140]  Yeah, BSC, yeah.
[10:02.140 --> 10:05.100]  Yeah, you could see all the code running on it,
[10:05.100 --> 10:07.980]  and it felt real mainframe-y in a weird way.
[10:07.980 --> 10:09.320]  Then there's the second generation,
[10:09.320 --> 10:12.540]  which is when they switched to a much smaller puck,
[10:12.540 --> 10:13.660]  the little black puck,
[10:13.660 --> 10:15.380]  and it was much simpler,
[10:15.380 --> 10:17.300]  and it was under the hood running.
[10:17.300 --> 10:19.940]  It was running a version of iOS.
[10:20.820 --> 10:23.580]  The third generation is really sort of like 2.5
[10:23.580 --> 10:25.120]  because it was just like,
[10:26.500 --> 10:27.620]  I forget what it added,
[10:27.620 --> 10:30.740]  but maybe that was when they added 1080p support.
[10:30.740 --> 10:32.100]  I forget, but it was...
[10:32.100 --> 10:34.780]  That is true, yeah, it was 1080p,
[10:34.780 --> 10:35.740]  and for some reason,
[10:35.740 --> 10:39.340]  because I have both versions in my home right now,
[10:39.340 --> 10:42.840]  for some reason, version two no longer runs YouTube.
[10:42.840 --> 10:45.260]  Yeah, exactly, no, I know why that is.
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.700]  Long story short, it's because at some point,
[10:47.700 --> 10:49.340]  Apple stopped doing software updates
[10:49.340 --> 10:51.260]  for that second generation one,
[10:51.260 --> 10:55.380]  and YouTube, like sometime within the last six months,
[10:55.380 --> 10:59.020]  YouTube changed their API
[10:59.020 --> 11:03.180]  to such that anything that hooked up to YouTube
[11:03.180 --> 11:06.140]  needed some sort of update to keep active with YouTube,
[11:06.140 --> 11:10.300]  and because the second generation Apple TV
[11:10.300 --> 11:11.800]  isn't getting software updates anymore,
[11:11.800 --> 11:13.540]  it can't use YouTube.
[11:13.540 --> 11:16.280]  Right, and so the second generation
[11:16.280 --> 11:18.740]  is still running the old iOS,
[11:18.740 --> 11:21.440]  which is all awkward and nasty,
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.180]  and then version three iOS looks pretty good,
[11:26.180 --> 11:28.580]  but nothing compared to this one.
[11:28.580 --> 11:30.620]  But I looked it up, it's called Fire,
[11:30.620 --> 11:31.820]  well, now it's called Firecore,
[11:31.820 --> 11:35.220]  that hack that you could install,
[11:35.220 --> 11:37.520]  and back then it was called ATV Flash.
[11:37.520 --> 11:39.380]  ATV Flash.
[11:39.380 --> 11:41.580]  Yeah, you would buy this software,
[11:41.580 --> 11:45.620]  you would use a USB stick to flash your Apple TV
[11:45.620 --> 11:48.900]  and override the OS somehow,
[11:48.900 --> 11:52.380]  and then you could do things like mount it
[11:52.380 --> 11:54.520]  on your Mac as an external hard drive,
[11:54.520 --> 11:57.360]  copy your movie library onto there,
[11:57.360 --> 11:59.060]  and I don't even remember how big the hard drive was,
[11:59.060 --> 12:00.740]  but it was enough that I could,
[12:00.740 --> 12:04.100]  and if you had a bunch of standard deaf movies,
[12:04.100 --> 12:06.040]  you could store them on there,
[12:06.040 --> 12:08.140]  you could also hook up an external drive,
[12:08.140 --> 12:09.460]  and so really that was my,
[12:09.460 --> 12:12.940]  oh, you can install other apps like Plex,
[12:14.460 --> 12:15.340]  I forget what else,
[12:15.340 --> 12:19.760]  but those Xbox Media Center kind of media players,
[12:19.760 --> 12:21.400]  and really, that's the only,
[12:21.400 --> 12:23.140]  I never jail broke my iPhone,
[12:23.140 --> 12:26.140]  but I totally jail broke the Apple TV
[12:26.140 --> 12:29.500]  just so I could do more stuff with it.
[12:29.500 --> 12:31.300]  So the original name was ATV Flash,
[12:31.300 --> 12:33.820]  and what's the new name, Fire?
[12:33.820 --> 12:36.100]  Firecore, now it's called Firecore.
[12:36.100 --> 12:36.940]  Okay.
[12:36.940 --> 12:38.120]  I don't know what it does now,
[12:38.120 --> 12:39.620]  because there's really no need for it.
[12:39.620 --> 12:40.460]  Right.
[12:41.740 --> 12:43.220]  Yeah, the first Apple TV,
[12:43.220 --> 12:44.260]  I mean, this was,
[12:44.260 --> 12:45.340]  I mean, that was really,
[12:45.340 --> 12:47.820]  I mean, and that was really
[12:47.820 --> 12:49.700]  when it was a quote unquote hobby for Apple,
[12:49.700 --> 12:51.680]  but the basic idea with the first Apple TV,
[12:51.680 --> 12:55.340]  again, it was like a Mac Mini under the hood.
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.980]  It had a spinning hard disk,
[12:56.980 --> 12:59.100]  and more or less, as I recall,
[12:59.100 --> 13:00.940]  unless I'm forgetting something,
[13:00.940 --> 13:03.340]  pretty much all it really was good for
[13:03.340 --> 13:05.460]  was watching movies that you had downloaded
[13:05.460 --> 13:07.200]  to the Apple TV somehow,
[13:07.200 --> 13:11.060]  like either from your iTunes on your computer,
[13:11.060 --> 13:13.660]  you could play a movie that you had downloaded,
[13:13.660 --> 13:18.660]  or if you got or rented or bought a movie from iTunes
[13:18.800 --> 13:19.820]  on your Apple TV,
[13:19.820 --> 13:21.540]  you had to wait for the whole thing to download,
[13:21.540 --> 13:23.180]  and then it would play.
[13:23.180 --> 13:24.500]  Maybe it would start before it finished,
[13:24.500 --> 13:25.900]  but you were still downloading it,
[13:25.900 --> 13:28.840]  and it was like taking up space on a hard drive.
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.380]  Exactly, and in hindsight,
[13:30.380 --> 13:32.660]  it makes total sense why they would call that a hobby,
[13:32.660 --> 13:34.060]  because it didn't work that well.
[13:34.060 --> 13:37.880]  It wasn't a good consumer experience.
[13:37.880 --> 13:39.680]  There was no airplay.
[13:39.680 --> 13:42.460]  There was very little.
[13:42.460 --> 13:44.260]  You needed it to have a big hard drive,
[13:44.260 --> 13:46.220]  just so you could store the movies that you bought,
[13:46.220 --> 13:49.220]  because you weren't getting them any other way.
[13:49.220 --> 13:50.060]  Yeah.
[13:50.060 --> 13:50.900]  And I think,
[13:50.900 --> 13:53.420]  it was, you know, I think we forget
[13:53.420 --> 13:57.020]  how much just home bandwidth has improved
[13:57.020 --> 13:59.620]  in the last eight, nine years.
[13:59.620 --> 14:03.580]  Yeah, geez, 2007, that first one came out.
[14:03.580 --> 14:05.660]  It seems like a lot longer ago than that.
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.700]  Yeah, and I think, you know,
[14:06.700 --> 14:10.060]  you go back in time to 2007 and run a speed test,
[14:10.060 --> 14:10.900]  you probably have a lot,
[14:10.900 --> 14:12.020]  most people would probably have
[14:12.020 --> 14:14.020]  a lot slower connection at home.
[14:14.020 --> 14:17.420]  I remember it used to be a common problem with that,
[14:17.420 --> 14:19.800]  where you would get like ready to,
[14:19.800 --> 14:22.260]  I do remember now that it definitely played
[14:22.260 --> 14:24.060]  before it completely downloaded a movie,
[14:24.060 --> 14:26.180]  but it would give you like a ready to play.
[14:26.180 --> 14:28.500]  And like for me, like the best you ever got
[14:28.500 --> 14:32.380]  would be like ready to play in two minutes.
[14:32.380 --> 14:33.540]  And you would wait two minutes
[14:33.540 --> 14:35.100]  and you know, maybe go to the bathroom
[14:35.100 --> 14:36.140]  before the movie started,
[14:36.140 --> 14:38.860]  maybe go mix a drink or something like that.
[14:38.860 --> 14:39.700]  And then it would go.
[14:39.700 --> 14:40.540]  But then sometimes you would get it
[14:40.540 --> 14:43.260]  and it'd be like ready to play, 30 minutes,
[14:43.260 --> 14:46.220]  spin, spin, spin, ready to play.
[14:46.220 --> 14:47.060]  31 minutes.
[14:47.060 --> 14:49.940]  If you were, if you had a bandwidth problem
[14:49.940 --> 14:51.420]  going on, ready to,
[14:51.420 --> 14:53.620]  and you've got the popcorn popped and everything,
[14:53.620 --> 14:56.340]  and then it's like ready to play, 17 hours.
[14:56.340 --> 14:58.040]  17 hours, 43 minutes.
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.740]  Excellent part one.
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.040]  As a modern dad, that really,
[15:04.040 --> 15:05.900]  it just, it really felt like,
[15:05.900 --> 15:09.140]  it really felt like I was just letting my family down.
[15:09.140 --> 15:10.260]  Right, but you know,
[15:10.260 --> 15:12.100]  you could always go to Blockbuster Video
[15:12.100 --> 15:14.780]  and rent the DVD in the same amount of time.
[15:14.780 --> 15:17.460]  Right, like in the Norman Rockwell America
[15:17.460 --> 15:18.740]  where your dad is the guy
[15:18.740 --> 15:20.740]  who could like fix the chain on your bike.
[15:20.740 --> 15:22.460]  You know, like you bust the chain on your bike
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.780]  and your dad, you know,
[15:23.780 --> 15:26.280]  would have like a bench in his basement
[15:26.280 --> 15:27.940]  or the garage where he could like
[15:27.940 --> 15:30.820]  do whatever it takes to fix a busted bike chain.
[15:30.820 --> 15:33.900]  Like my version of that is, you know,
[15:33.900 --> 15:36.260]  a large part of it involves, you know,
[15:36.260 --> 15:39.340]  ones and zeros and connecting things and making them work.
[15:39.340 --> 15:40.940]  And then you promise your family, you know,
[15:40.940 --> 15:43.060]  like, hey, let's watch the new Pixar.
[15:43.060 --> 15:44.620]  And everybody's excited.
[15:44.620 --> 15:46.660]  And like you said, the popcorn's popped
[15:46.660 --> 15:48.980]  and it says, ready to play in 17 hours.
[15:48.980 --> 15:50.260]  And it just never goes on well.
[15:50.260 --> 15:52.600]  And I know there are still times today.
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.540]  I know that, I don't know about with the new Apple TV.
[15:54.540 --> 15:55.900]  I've never had a problem like that yet
[15:55.900 --> 15:57.360]  in a week that I've had the new Apple TV.
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.300]  But I know that there are times where even with like
[16:00.300 --> 16:02.000]  the third generation Apple TV
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.380]  that just got superseded last week,
[16:04.380 --> 16:06.160]  that people would get problems like that
[16:06.160 --> 16:08.380]  or just get a spinner that never stops.
[16:08.380 --> 16:11.100]  You know, for whatever reason.
[16:11.100 --> 16:15.500]  Yeah, those edge cases where you wouldn't know what to do,
[16:15.500 --> 16:17.580]  like where the Apple TV wouldn't know what to do
[16:17.580 --> 16:19.980]  just because something went wrong,
[16:19.980 --> 16:22.260]  but it didn't know how to like correct itself quickly.
[16:22.260 --> 16:25.320]  Like if you, like iTunes can't download this purchase,
[16:25.320 --> 16:28.380]  that kind of error message that it wasn't really clear
[16:28.380 --> 16:29.220]  what the hell happened,
[16:29.220 --> 16:30.900]  except that the thing that you bought
[16:30.900 --> 16:32.980]  won't play on your thing.
[16:33.980 --> 16:38.980]  But yeah, there's no better example of what it,
[16:38.980 --> 16:42.560]  of that domestic kind of uncomfortableness
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.080]  that happens when you and your domestic partner,
[16:47.080 --> 16:48.880]  your spouse, are sitting down
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.880]  and she or he can't understand why you're so,
[16:52.880 --> 16:56.760]  why, A, why you can't fix this thing
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.920]  because all she wants to do is watch a movie,
[16:59.920 --> 17:03.740]  but also why you're spending so much time sweating it.
[17:03.740 --> 17:05.800]  Because like this is the future.
[17:05.800 --> 17:08.560]  This thing that we hooked up to our computer
[17:08.560 --> 17:11.880]  is the future and just like give it time.
[17:11.880 --> 17:13.360]  Just be patient.
[17:13.360 --> 17:16.000]  And she's like, there's a VCR sitting right there,
[17:16.000 --> 17:16.880]  like right there.
[17:16.880 --> 17:19.900]  We've got a copy of Beetlejuice, ready to go.
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.120]  But I mean, like-
[17:22.120 --> 17:25.160]  And when we used to watch them on discs, DVDs or Blu-rays,
[17:25.160 --> 17:27.040]  or even going back to the tapes
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.680]  where the worst thing you could have with the tape
[17:28.680 --> 17:30.840]  is you'd have to wait for it to rewind.
[17:30.840 --> 17:33.440]  Even going back to that era, at least once,
[17:33.440 --> 17:35.480]  the worst case scenario is that you,
[17:35.480 --> 17:38.880]  maybe your DVDs in the shelf in the living room
[17:38.880 --> 17:40.720]  aren't alphabetized, you know?
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.440]  And it might take a minute or two,
[17:42.440 --> 17:43.920]  like you ever have that problem where it's like,
[17:43.920 --> 17:45.560]  where the hell is the movie we're looking for?
[17:45.560 --> 17:48.560]  Sure, yeah, because they're very thin boxes.
[17:48.560 --> 17:51.640]  And I mean, sometimes a DVD scratches
[17:51.640 --> 17:54.520]  and it won't, and it skips and it won't play.
[17:54.520 --> 17:58.060]  VHS, you take it out of the deck
[17:58.060 --> 17:59.800]  and you put it in your little thing,
[17:59.800 --> 18:01.640]  like your little car rewinder,
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.880]  you know, your little rewind,
[18:03.880 --> 18:06.680]  your VHS rewinder that's shaped like a car,
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.480]  wait for it, maybe like two minutes to rewind.
[18:09.480 --> 18:11.200]  It seems like, I guess,
[18:11.200 --> 18:12.880]  the more complicated technology gets,
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.880]  this is a real Irma Baumbach observation,
[18:18.220 --> 18:20.640]  the more complicated technology gets,
[18:20.640 --> 18:23.060]  the more of a pain in the ass it is.
[18:23.060 --> 18:26.860]  It doesn't go over well when you get the 17 hours
[18:26.860 --> 18:28.320]  until it's ready to play.
[18:28.320 --> 18:31.360]  But not only that, but my specialty was like AV stuff,
[18:31.360 --> 18:33.160]  like I was AV guy in the family,
[18:33.160 --> 18:36.340]  and would always have every cable for everything.
[18:36.340 --> 18:37.840]  And if my dad couldn't figure out
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.560]  how to get the damn receiver to go to the DVD player,
[18:41.560 --> 18:43.880]  then I would just like print out instructions and stuff.
[18:43.880 --> 18:46.600]  But when it's in software,
[18:46.600 --> 18:49.480]  unless you're like a real smart person,
[18:49.480 --> 18:50.560]  you can't figure it out.
[18:50.560 --> 18:52.280]  There's no troubleshooting it.
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.100]  Yeah, you just gotta hit the thing.
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.920]  But this one seems pretty rock solid though.
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.040]  The new Apple TV.
[19:02.040 --> 19:05.600]  Yeah, performances, I've had a couple of crashes,
[19:05.600 --> 19:08.200]  not system crashes, but app crashes.
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.060]  The worst thing I've seen so far
[19:10.060 --> 19:11.900]  is that I've had a couple of times
[19:11.900 --> 19:15.700]  where it's like I turn my TV back on.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.560]  And this is not Apple TV's fault,
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.920]  or at least it can't be,
[19:18.920 --> 19:22.640]  because my TV is so old that it doesn't have the,
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.040]  it's called HDMI-CEC,
[19:27.040 --> 19:31.040]  which is the way that if your devices all speak,
[19:31.040 --> 19:36.040]  the HDMI-CEC, they can turn each other on and off
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.000]  and they can do things like change the HDMI input.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.160]  So with an ideal TV set,
[19:43.160 --> 19:45.280]  in theory you can just turn on your Apple TV
[19:45.280 --> 19:47.560]  and it will also turn on your TV
[19:47.560 --> 19:50.800]  and will switch the input on your TV to the Apple TV input.
[19:50.800 --> 19:53.780]  So you just do one, hit one button and it all goes on.
[19:54.860 --> 19:56.080]  I don't have that.
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.180]  My TV isn't even supposed to do that.
[19:58.180 --> 20:01.080]  So I have to turn the TV on first
[20:01.080 --> 20:03.300]  and then switch the input on the TV remote
[20:03.300 --> 20:05.520]  and then turn on the Apple TV or vice versa.
[20:05.520 --> 20:07.680]  But I've had twice so far in the last few days
[20:07.680 --> 20:09.320]  where the Apple TV turns on,
[20:09.320 --> 20:11.240]  I see the little white light on it,
[20:11.240 --> 20:14.600]  but I don't see anything on screen.
[20:14.600 --> 20:16.180]  It's just like black.
[20:16.180 --> 20:18.800]  But it's also not like a no signal picture.
[20:18.800 --> 20:21.840]  It's just like still there.
[20:21.840 --> 20:22.680]  So what do you do?
[20:22.680 --> 20:23.640]  You hit the menu button?
[20:25.340 --> 20:27.080]  What seems to fix it for me
[20:27.080 --> 20:29.200]  is switching to another HDMI.
[20:29.200 --> 20:30.200]  This doesn't make any sense.
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.280]  I don't even get how this would fix it,
[20:32.280 --> 20:36.480]  but it seems like if I switch to another input on the TV,
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.680]  like to the TiVo and then go back to Apple TV
[20:38.680 --> 20:43.160]  and then hit menu or something or home, it'll work.
[20:43.160 --> 20:44.640]  But if I don't switch,
[20:45.520 --> 20:47.360]  I can just sit there and hit home or menu
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.680]  and it doesn't do anything.
[20:48.680 --> 20:50.720]  Maybe, and that seems like a placebo to me
[20:50.720 --> 20:52.840]  because switching the HDMI input on the TV
[20:52.840 --> 20:57.800]  shouldn't affect what the Apple TV is sending out at all.
[20:57.800 --> 21:01.400]  Well, I think it just kind of rejiggers it a little bit.
[21:01.400 --> 21:02.680]  I think that's what I,
[21:02.680 --> 21:04.680]  if I'm right that it's not a placebo,
[21:04.680 --> 21:05.880]  I do think that that's it,
[21:05.880 --> 21:07.840]  that there's some kind of rejiggering.
[21:07.840 --> 21:09.920]  Like when you first switch,
[21:09.920 --> 21:11.200]  I don't know anything about HDMI.
[21:11.200 --> 21:12.520]  I don't know how it works.
[21:12.520 --> 21:13.800]  Well, it is bi-directional.
[21:13.800 --> 21:15.900]  Right, and so in other words, yeah.
[21:15.900 --> 21:17.880]  So the rejiggering might be like
[21:19.520 --> 21:22.800]  when I switch the TV's input to the TiVo
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.400]  and it's away from Apple TV,
[21:24.400 --> 21:27.300]  it might tell the Apple TV, okay, I'm leaving.
[21:27.300 --> 21:30.040]  And then when I switch back, it's like, hey, I'm here again.
[21:30.040 --> 21:31.880]  And then the Apple TV somehow,
[21:33.120 --> 21:35.720]  and I never had that problem with my previous Apple TV.
[21:35.720 --> 21:36.880]  And I can't help but think it's some kind
[21:36.880 --> 21:39.320]  of little silly bug and they will fix it.
[21:39.320 --> 21:40.960]  And it's probably the type of bug
[21:40.960 --> 21:42.080]  that was easily slipped through
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.320]  because I'll bet that internally at Apple,
[21:44.320 --> 21:48.040]  they weren't really testing on a lot of TVs as old as mine.
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.740]  Right, well, who knows?
[21:49.740 --> 21:53.520]  I bet they have a warehouse full of every single TV
[21:53.520 --> 21:56.000]  in the last two decades,
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.240]  since flat screens have started being made
[21:59.240 --> 22:02.280]  or since the HDMI standard came out.
[22:02.280 --> 22:04.500]  I bet they test them pretty extensively.
[22:04.500 --> 22:07.560]  They probably just don't put very much weight
[22:07.560 --> 22:09.800]  into making it work perfectly.
[22:09.800 --> 22:11.420]  Well, and it doesn't happen every time.
[22:11.420 --> 22:14.640]  And so I'm not too concerned about it.
[22:14.640 --> 22:17.760]  And it's, once you're already, I'm so used
[22:17.760 --> 22:20.280]  to the little back and forth dance of,
[22:20.280 --> 22:22.100]  I gotta use like two or three different remotes,
[22:22.100 --> 22:23.800]  turn on the sound, turn on the TV,
[22:23.800 --> 22:26.120]  turn the input on the TV, turn on the thing.
[22:26.120 --> 22:28.160]  But then once I have that set up, then once it's working,
[22:28.160 --> 22:30.680]  I can just use the Apple TV remote, I'm happy.
[22:30.680 --> 22:33.080]  Yeah, so we have a couple of these,
[22:33.080 --> 22:35.780]  we have a couple of these smart TVs at home.
[22:37.520 --> 22:39.960]  And I heard you and Guy talking about this a little bit.
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.000]  He said he has a TV with a Netflix app built into it.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.020]  So Visio makes these and they're real cheap
[22:45.020 --> 22:48.540]  and they're smart TVs and they've got most of the apps.
[22:48.540 --> 22:53.540]  They've got Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, other ones, Yahoo,
[22:54.480 --> 22:58.100]  all of them, the main streaming video apps.
[22:58.100 --> 23:00.860]  And there's something so freeing about,
[23:02.580 --> 23:04.720]  like one of the TVs we have is 32 inches
[23:04.720 --> 23:08.540]  because it's just meant to go in the playroom basically.
[23:08.540 --> 23:10.480]  There's something so freeing about unplugging it,
[23:10.480 --> 23:12.320]  picking it up, putting it somewhere else.
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.920]  It's already on the wifi,
[23:13.920 --> 23:15.800]  putting it down anywhere in the house
[23:15.800 --> 23:17.680]  and you just like launch the Netflix app
[23:17.680 --> 23:19.260]  and it'll play a video
[23:19.260 --> 23:21.800]  without any other crap connected to it.
[23:21.800 --> 23:24.080]  That's, you know, that's like,
[23:24.080 --> 23:27.980]  that is the era of software in TV.
[23:27.980 --> 23:30.120]  And I don't think most people have gotten to like really,
[23:30.120 --> 23:33.180]  like really see that future all that much
[23:34.940 --> 23:39.940]  just because we've, the development of software in TV
[23:39.940 --> 23:43.100]  in this way that we're seeing in Apple TV
[23:43.100 --> 23:45.680]  has been really gone, going on,
[23:45.680 --> 23:47.460]  it's been going on concurrently
[23:48.400 --> 23:51.080]  where TVs themselves are getting smart,
[23:51.080 --> 23:54.180]  but also there's just every hardware company out there
[23:54.180 --> 23:57.680]  is making its own little box that you're supposed to plug in
[23:57.680 --> 24:02.020]  so it's really two roads at the same time
[24:02.020 --> 24:05.000]  and it's a matter of who's kind of getting there first.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  And I, for my money, you know, the Apple TV model
[24:10.460 --> 24:14.780]  is really, really smart, elegant, you know,
[24:14.780 --> 24:16.660]  box that holds everything
[24:16.660 --> 24:19.220]  is probably the way that I would go
[24:19.220 --> 24:21.780]  instead of, you know, the other model
[24:21.780 --> 24:24.580]  which is them making their own screen or whatever it is.
[24:26.140 --> 24:27.660]  Did you see that I linked to a thing the other day
[24:27.660 --> 24:31.600]  on Daring Fireball written by Abdel Ibrahim?
[24:31.600 --> 24:32.440]  Yeah, I read that.
[24:32.440 --> 24:33.540]  He's got his own blog,
[24:33.540 --> 24:35.020]  but he wrote this one at Medium
[24:35.020 --> 24:38.380]  and more or less he's saying,
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.540]  and this is after, you know,
[24:39.540 --> 24:41.020]  he got his hands on the new Apple TV
[24:41.020 --> 24:43.820]  that he still thinks Apple is gonna build a TV set
[24:43.820 --> 24:45.700]  with Apple TV built in, you know,
[24:45.700 --> 24:48.420]  sort of the white whale of Apple TV.
[24:48.420 --> 24:49.900]  Sure, sure.
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.500]  And I do see, you know,
[24:51.500 --> 24:54.080]  you can't help but see the appeal of that a little bit.
[24:54.080 --> 24:59.080]  Like, even going back to my childhood,
[24:59.460 --> 25:01.060]  I mean, it was probably before you were born,
[25:01.060 --> 25:02.180]  you're a youngster,
[25:02.180 --> 25:06.500]  but like when we first got our Atari 2600
[25:07.460 --> 25:09.460]  and you'd hook it up to the TV,
[25:09.460 --> 25:12.140]  like on the, it was like the coaxial end, I guess.
[25:12.140 --> 25:14.260]  And, or maybe it wasn't even coaxial end.
[25:14.260 --> 25:15.080]  No, it wasn't.
[25:15.080 --> 25:16.620]  It was, there was like this.
[25:16.620 --> 25:18.460]  You screw them in, you screw them in,
[25:18.460 --> 25:19.300]  the little pins that you screw in.
[25:19.300 --> 25:21.020]  Yeah, like two little prongs,
[25:21.020 --> 25:23.420]  like two little prongs and you'd screw them in.
[25:23.420 --> 25:24.620]  Yeah.
[25:24.620 --> 25:26.740]  It was like to hook up your Atari 2600,
[25:26.740 --> 25:28.460]  you were, you were like risking-
[25:28.460 --> 25:29.660]  You were getting a screwdriver.
[25:29.660 --> 25:33.780]  You were risking a shock, but there was also,
[25:33.780 --> 25:34.860]  and I still, to this day,
[25:34.860 --> 25:36.300]  this is probably something I should look up,
[25:36.300 --> 25:39.060]  because I've been curious about it since I was like seven,
[25:39.060 --> 25:40.780]  is you had the option between doing it
[25:40.780 --> 25:42.640]  on channel two or channel three.
[25:42.640 --> 25:43.860]  Oh, no, it was three or four, wasn't it?
[25:43.860 --> 25:45.180]  Or three or four, whatever it was.
[25:45.180 --> 25:46.920]  It was two of the lower channels.
[25:46.920 --> 25:48.820]  And I don't know why that was an option.
[25:48.820 --> 25:53.180]  There must've been some kind of case where this-
[25:53.180 --> 25:54.340]  Frequency interference.
[25:54.340 --> 25:57.020]  Yeah, that like if you got like a real strong signal
[25:57.020 --> 25:58.540]  from your local channel three station,
[25:58.540 --> 26:00.580]  channel four would be better for Atari or something.
[26:00.580 --> 26:02.600]  Right, or your microwave was on channel three,
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.380]  so you had to put your Atari on channel four.
[26:05.380 --> 26:06.220]  Yeah.
[26:06.220 --> 26:07.540]  Something stupid like that, you know?
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.860]  Just, oh God, analog,
[26:09.860 --> 26:13.060]  the analog video world could not have gone away sooner,
[26:13.060 --> 26:14.600]  as far as I'm concerned.
[26:14.600 --> 26:17.460]  But even that little, once you had the thing hooked up
[26:17.460 --> 26:19.140]  and there was the two, three thing,
[26:19.140 --> 26:21.340]  and I don't know, sometimes it would,
[26:21.340 --> 26:22.180]  I don't even know why,
[26:22.180 --> 26:24.220]  like maybe somebody would accidentally flip that switch
[26:24.220 --> 26:25.780]  because they thought they were flipping
[26:25.780 --> 26:28.260]  the difficulty switch on the Atari.
[26:28.260 --> 26:30.820]  And then you'd be like, your Atari,
[26:30.820 --> 26:32.460]  it wouldn't come on, it would just be static.
[26:32.460 --> 26:34.060]  And you'd be like, turn the dial, you know?
[26:34.060 --> 26:35.220]  And you turn the dial to four.
[26:35.220 --> 26:37.340]  And it's like, anything like that is such,
[26:37.340 --> 26:40.540]  it just feels irritating.
[26:40.540 --> 26:41.820]  It just feels- It is irritating.
[26:41.820 --> 26:45.260]  It just feels like we're still in a race
[26:45.260 --> 26:49.060]  to get back to the simplicity of TV
[26:49.060 --> 26:51.780]  before there was anything you could ever plug into your TV,
[26:51.780 --> 26:53.820]  where it was just a box that you turned on
[26:53.820 --> 26:56.460]  and there was a dial that had, you know,
[26:56.460 --> 26:59.460]  14 things on it, right?
[26:59.460 --> 27:02.900]  It was like two through 13 and UHF, whatever that was.
[27:04.060 --> 27:04.900]  And that was it.
[27:05.900 --> 27:08.780]  You'd turn the dial to one of those 14 things
[27:08.780 --> 27:11.580]  and you could turn the thing on or off.
[27:11.580 --> 27:12.980]  And that was it.
[27:12.980 --> 27:13.820]  And there was this-
[27:13.820 --> 27:16.020]  And there were four companies,
[27:16.020 --> 27:18.140]  there were three companies out there
[27:18.140 --> 27:20.820]  making everything that you could possibly need to watch.
[27:20.820 --> 27:23.420]  Well, everything that you really wanted to watch, right?
[27:23.420 --> 27:24.660]  All of the prime time stuff
[27:24.660 --> 27:28.420]  came from three different companies, ABC, NBC, CBS.
[27:28.420 --> 27:29.700]  I don't know what they had around the world,
[27:29.700 --> 27:31.060]  but in the US, that's what we had.
[27:31.060 --> 27:31.900]  And we liked it.
[27:34.540 --> 27:37.100]  Now, obviously, you know, we don't want to go back to that,
[27:37.100 --> 27:40.620]  but I feel like we've spent 30 years
[27:40.620 --> 27:42.860]  trying to get back to that level of simplicity.
[27:44.780 --> 27:45.620]  Absolutely.
[27:45.620 --> 27:47.660]  And I think where we're getting there
[27:47.660 --> 27:50.700]  is the intelligence of discovery,
[27:50.700 --> 27:54.340]  like how software makes it so much easier.
[27:54.340 --> 27:57.220]  Even though there's literally exponentially,
[28:00.300 --> 28:03.540]  thousands to hundreds of thousands of times
[28:03.540 --> 28:05.020]  more content out there,
[28:06.180 --> 28:10.060]  always available for us than there used to be
[28:10.060 --> 28:13.740]  with just the three channels, you know, 14 channels.
[28:14.860 --> 28:19.860]  The software has made it so that we could filter
[28:20.220 --> 28:24.060]  and find the equivalent of those three channels of stuff
[28:24.060 --> 28:26.260]  that we really want to watch at any given time.
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.740]  At least that's the theory.
[28:28.740 --> 28:31.820]  Right, and it just can get confusing.
[28:31.820 --> 28:32.660]  Like I've been listening,
[28:32.660 --> 28:34.160]  I listened to some podcasts this week
[28:34.160 --> 28:35.780]  where people were talking about Apple TV
[28:35.780 --> 28:39.580]  and like Jason Snell was saying that, you know,
[28:39.580 --> 28:42.420]  for years now, or at least the last few years,
[28:42.420 --> 28:44.540]  his family spent more of their time
[28:44.540 --> 28:46.740]  when they watched Netflix doing it through the TiVo
[28:46.740 --> 28:48.900]  than doing it through Apple TV.
[28:48.900 --> 28:51.180]  And like Netflix is a perfect example
[28:51.180 --> 28:52.900]  because Netflix really is everywhere.
[28:52.900 --> 28:55.140]  It's on any device that will take them.
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.220]  And so I had a, I first saw it on a Wii.
[29:01.540 --> 29:03.500]  I didn't even have a streaming,
[29:03.500 --> 29:05.580]  I think Roku was maybe the first streaming box
[29:05.580 --> 29:10.580]  that got Netflix, but you could get the disc for the Wii
[29:11.160 --> 29:13.780]  and launch that app from the disc
[29:13.780 --> 29:16.420]  and it would let you browse the Netflix streaming content.
[29:16.420 --> 29:19.140]  And it was like, it was miraculous.
[29:19.140 --> 29:21.740]  It was even kind of better than the other,
[29:21.740 --> 29:25.780]  like the Netflix experience in the browser.
[29:27.840 --> 29:30.180]  But it's like, there's so many ways to do it.
[29:30.180 --> 29:31.020]  You know what I mean?
[29:31.020 --> 29:32.520]  Like, so you could use your TiVo,
[29:32.520 --> 29:35.340]  you could use your Wii, you could use your PlayStation.
[29:35.340 --> 29:36.780]  I guess there's one for Xbox.
[29:36.780 --> 29:38.820]  I don't know, I don't have an Xbox, but.
[29:38.820 --> 29:39.660]  I'm sure.
[29:41.600 --> 29:43.420]  Some of your TVs, like we were just saying,
[29:43.420 --> 29:45.880]  some of your TVs have Netflix built right in.
[29:45.880 --> 29:48.000]  So you don't even need to have a box connected,
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.740]  or you could use your Apple TV,
[29:49.740 --> 29:53.700]  or you could use the app on your phone or whatever
[29:53.700 --> 29:56.900]  and just airplay it over to your Apple TV
[29:56.900 --> 29:58.620]  or something like that.
[29:58.620 --> 30:00.340]  And it's all essentially just code.
[30:00.340 --> 30:03.340]  It's just code that's whose only purpose
[30:03.340 --> 30:06.020]  is to deliver you all of that media
[30:06.020 --> 30:07.660]  that Netflix has available.
[30:07.660 --> 30:11.020]  Right, but what I can see is I can kind of,
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.020]  and this to me gets to the heart
[30:13.020 --> 30:15.220]  of what I feel like people miss.
[30:15.220 --> 30:17.900]  I can kind of see how this new Apple TV
[30:17.900 --> 30:20.280]  could be the only thing on your TV.
[30:21.580 --> 30:23.960]  Absolutely, that's what I would like.
[30:23.960 --> 30:25.340]  I mean, as soon as it can get me
[30:25.340 --> 30:29.300]  every single piece of TV content I could conceivably need,
[30:29.300 --> 30:31.400]  I do not want to switch to input two.
[30:36.740 --> 30:39.380]  And really, I used to think
[30:39.380 --> 30:40.860]  that Apple was gonna make a TV.
[30:40.860 --> 30:44.500]  I would agree with with Abdel's assessment
[30:44.500 --> 30:48.100]  like maybe a year or two ago.
[30:48.100 --> 30:50.740]  I don't think it makes sense for them to do it anymore
[30:50.740 --> 30:55.620]  because they're able to iterate on this box
[30:55.620 --> 30:58.320]  so much faster than people want to buy a new screen.
[31:00.080 --> 31:00.920]  Personally.
[31:02.420 --> 31:05.220]  And we've talked, I think this is probably
[31:05.220 --> 31:09.260]  like the most evergreen topic in the history
[31:09.260 --> 31:12.700]  of talking about Apple stuff because it's,
[31:12.700 --> 31:14.460]  I mean, we've been talking about this forever.
[31:14.460 --> 31:17.220]  I mean, Dan Benjamin and I used to talk about this.
[31:17.220 --> 31:19.460]  I mean, that was like 20 years ago, right?
[31:19.460 --> 31:21.600]  It was a long time ago.
[31:23.160 --> 31:26.860]  And my old thinking, well, of course they'll do it
[31:26.860 --> 31:31.860]  is why sell $100 box for a $2,000 TV
[31:33.060 --> 31:37.540]  instead of selling a $2,000 TV or for Apple a $3,000 TV.
[31:38.860 --> 31:41.120]  And in the years since that basic thinking,
[31:41.120 --> 31:44.240]  the average cost of a big flat screen modern TV
[31:44.240 --> 31:47.300]  has dropped way below, they're not $2,000 anymore.
[31:47.300 --> 31:50.220]  I mean, you can buy one for 2000, but most people don't.
[31:50.220 --> 31:51.900]  Most people get them for just a couple hundred bucks.
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.820]  So there's not that much more money there.
[31:53.820 --> 31:56.100]  And maybe at some point they get to an equilibrium
[31:56.100 --> 31:59.220]  where the cost of the screen comes down so low,
[31:59.220 --> 32:02.060]  maybe to the point where it's the same cost as an iPhone
[32:02.060 --> 32:04.420]  and then the rest of it, the cost is subsidized
[32:04.420 --> 32:08.620]  by all the media that you're gonna buy through it anyway.
[32:08.620 --> 32:10.900]  Right, and the other thing that makes me,
[32:10.900 --> 32:13.020]  and I linked to it and I'm optimistic
[32:13.020 --> 32:14.900]  because I'd like to kind of see it
[32:14.900 --> 32:17.340]  and I would like to buy it no matter what it costs.
[32:17.340 --> 32:19.820]  I would like to buy the Apple branded TV.
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.820]  I don't think that they'll make it though
[32:23.820 --> 32:28.220]  because I feel like they would still have to make the box
[32:28.220 --> 32:31.940]  and keep it up to date because so many people have a TV
[32:31.940 --> 32:34.300]  that they don't wanna pay to replace
[32:34.300 --> 32:36.980]  because they've just bought it in the last few years.
[32:36.980 --> 32:38.580]  It's good enough.
[32:38.580 --> 32:42.460]  And as much as the people like us who obsess about this
[32:42.460 --> 32:45.400]  and would just go, if somebody said, here's the Apple TV,
[32:45.400 --> 32:46.940]  we're not gonna even tell you the specs on it.
[32:46.940 --> 32:47.980]  Do you wanna buy it or not?
[32:47.980 --> 32:50.020]  Of course, I would just buy it, right?
[32:50.020 --> 32:51.680]  But we're not normal, normal people.
[32:51.680 --> 32:54.780]  And it gets lost because normal people
[32:54.780 --> 32:56.600]  do upgrade their phones a lot.
[32:56.600 --> 32:57.760]  It's just the way that it is.
[32:57.760 --> 32:58.960]  Phones take a beating.
[33:00.260 --> 33:03.500]  A lot of totally normal non-nerd people
[33:03.500 --> 33:05.420]  upgrade their phone every two years
[33:05.420 --> 33:08.480]  and every three years, the number's even bigger.
[33:09.660 --> 33:11.500]  People aren't like that with things like TVs.
[33:11.500 --> 33:14.100]  And we might do it just because it's Apple,
[33:14.100 --> 33:15.100]  but normal people wouldn't.
[33:15.100 --> 33:16.980]  So it wouldn't make sense to say
[33:16.980 --> 33:20.540]  the only way to get the current Apple TV experience
[33:20.540 --> 33:24.540]  is to buy the entire Apple TV set.
[33:24.540 --> 33:26.000]  So they'd still have to make the box.
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.740]  And if they're still gonna make the box,
[33:27.740 --> 33:29.980]  why not just make the box and just have that be it
[33:29.980 --> 33:31.660]  and hook it up to everybody's TV?
[33:31.660 --> 33:35.540]  Yeah, I think that's the way it's gonna shake out.
[33:35.540 --> 33:38.580]  There's a couple of other reasons I believe that now, too.
[33:38.580 --> 33:43.580]  And actually, it's funny, I notice this phenomenon
[33:43.620 --> 33:48.220]  because when we shoot commercials in locations a lot,
[33:48.220 --> 33:50.340]  in people's real homes, and a lot of the times
[33:50.340 --> 33:52.960]  we're looking for rich people homes.
[33:52.960 --> 33:55.340]  And around LA, a lot of rich people
[33:55.340 --> 33:57.600]  will rent out their homes for locations.
[33:57.600 --> 34:02.300]  And you can always see, you can walk into a home
[34:02.300 --> 34:05.500]  of any era and see when the owners made their money.
[34:05.500 --> 34:07.780]  Because you can tell when their TVs were installed,
[34:07.780 --> 34:10.300]  like when their flat screens were purchased
[34:10.300 --> 34:12.660]  and installed on their walls
[34:12.660 --> 34:16.220]  because people don't replace their TVs that often.
[34:16.220 --> 34:17.940]  So a lot of times it's very common
[34:17.940 --> 34:20.700]  is go walk into like a two, $3 million house
[34:20.700 --> 34:25.260]  and all the flat screens are from 2006 or something
[34:25.260 --> 34:30.260]  with like super huge edges on the,
[34:30.380 --> 34:32.500]  flat screens didn't start getting attractive
[34:32.500 --> 34:34.220]  until very recently.
[34:34.220 --> 34:35.780]  And that's the other reason that I don't think
[34:35.780 --> 34:38.400]  Apple needs to make a TV, is because,
[34:39.340 --> 34:42.140]  like I'm a big fan of Vizio TVs.
[34:42.140 --> 34:45.820]  Vizio makes the bezel so small that you can barely see it.
[34:45.820 --> 34:48.580]  And if it's any smaller, it's just a piece of glass.
[34:48.580 --> 34:50.580]  And if Apple makes a piece of glass, then I'll buy that.
[34:50.580 --> 34:52.200]  But otherwise, I'm fine.
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.300]  I don't need anodized aluminum or anything.
[34:56.300 --> 35:00.300]  Yeah, I've seen that too, looking at houses.
[35:00.300 --> 35:01.700]  Like a couple months ago,
[35:01.700 --> 35:04.300]  we were looking at maybe thinking about moving here
[35:04.300 --> 35:06.780]  and the place we looked at had,
[35:06.780 --> 35:08.380]  it was a beautiful house overall.
[35:08.380 --> 35:10.420]  It didn't really work for us,
[35:10.420 --> 35:13.300]  but overall it was a beautiful house.
[35:13.300 --> 35:16.580]  Almost more like, so beautiful,
[35:16.580 --> 35:19.480]  beautiful for like taking pictures of the house
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.580]  as opposed to actually living there.
[35:21.580 --> 35:25.820]  But it had this, it had this big living room,
[35:25.820 --> 35:29.420]  kitchen sort of combination room with double height ceilings
[35:29.420 --> 35:32.900]  it was more like a lobby than like a room.
[35:32.900 --> 35:35.220]  It almost was like the look more like the lobby
[35:35.220 --> 35:38.260]  to like a boutique, like a really boutique small hotel.
[35:38.260 --> 35:40.540]  And they had a beautiful fireplace
[35:40.540 --> 35:43.140]  and the fireplace all the way from the ground
[35:43.140 --> 35:48.140]  to the ceiling above it was like rocks set together.
[35:49.260 --> 35:51.380]  Not quite bricks, cause they were like irregular,
[35:51.380 --> 35:53.420]  but they did all the work of finding rocks
[35:53.420 --> 35:55.780]  that perfectly fit together to form a column
[35:55.780 --> 35:56.780]  going up to the ceiling.
[35:56.780 --> 35:59.420]  And then set into the rocks above the fireplace
[35:59.420 --> 36:02.680]  was space to install your flat screen TV.
[36:02.680 --> 36:06.020]  And it was like, it was like maybe like 46 inches.
[36:08.740 --> 36:09.640]  And that's what they had.
[36:09.640 --> 36:12.500]  They had like a 46 inch TV in there.
[36:12.500 --> 36:14.640]  And you know, we're in there as a family
[36:14.640 --> 36:16.700]  looking at this house and I just looked at Jonas
[36:16.700 --> 36:20.180]  and Jonas looked at me and he just shook his head.
[36:20.180 --> 36:21.620]  He was disappointed.
[36:21.620 --> 36:24.660]  But like, but also like they literally set
[36:24.660 --> 36:26.900]  the maximum size of a TV you could have
[36:26.900 --> 36:29.260]  in this room in stone.
[36:29.260 --> 36:30.580]  Yeah.
[36:30.580 --> 36:32.040]  Oh, they literally set it in stone.
[36:32.040 --> 36:34.060]  Well, you can take the TV out,
[36:34.060 --> 36:37.900]  but then the only logical place to put a TV in this room
[36:37.900 --> 36:39.160]  was there.
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.300]  And I mean, you can put one in it,
[36:40.300 --> 36:41.900]  you can put a TV anywhere, but you know,
[36:41.900 --> 36:43.940]  like there's certain rooms, like a living room type thing
[36:43.940 --> 36:46.180]  where you go in and it's like, you can just tell
[36:46.180 --> 36:47.620]  if we're gonna put a TV in this room,
[36:47.620 --> 36:50.060]  the TV is gonna go there because it doesn't really,
[36:50.060 --> 36:53.300]  you know, for symmetry reasons or other layout reasons.
[36:53.300 --> 36:55.220]  The only real place to put it would be on the wall
[36:55.220 --> 36:58.380]  above the fireplace and it was set into the stone.
[36:58.380 --> 36:59.980]  There was like a cutout where you would put
[36:59.980 --> 37:02.460]  your flat screen TV and I would say the maximum TV
[37:02.460 --> 37:04.760]  that would fit in there was like maybe 46,
[37:04.760 --> 37:06.220]  maybe even a little smaller.
[37:06.220 --> 37:07.320]  Right, oh, that's a shame.
[37:07.320 --> 37:08.940]  So you could just find, you could just find out,
[37:08.940 --> 37:10.520]  you could, again, like you said, I bet,
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.920]  I don't know what time, what year the house was built,
[37:12.920 --> 37:14.740]  but I'm sure you could figure it out by finding out
[37:14.740 --> 37:18.360]  what year a 46 inch TV was like the best model
[37:18.360 --> 37:19.580]  you could buy. The premium model.
[37:19.580 --> 37:20.420]  Right.
[37:20.420 --> 37:24.460]  Yeah, when that was the model that cost like $5,000.
[37:24.460 --> 37:25.300]  Exactly.
[37:25.300 --> 37:28.100]  Because that's what rich people will spend on a TV.
[37:28.100 --> 37:29.940]  But, and then the last point, and you alluded to this,
[37:29.940 --> 37:32.540]  but I think it definitely bears repeating,
[37:32.540 --> 37:37.540]  is if Apple sold, let's say, a $2,000 TV set,
[37:38.080 --> 37:41.580]  it would be so awesome for a year and then 12 months later,
[37:41.580 --> 37:45.660]  it's whatever A10 or A11, whatever year you're imagining
[37:45.660 --> 37:49.340]  Apple comes out with this, it's A10 system on a chip
[37:49.340 --> 37:51.520]  is all of a sudden outdated.
[37:51.520 --> 37:55.260]  And nobody is going to buy a new TV set every year.
[37:55.260 --> 37:57.620]  People might buy a new Apple TV box
[37:57.620 --> 38:00.840]  that costs $100 every year, or every other year, maybe,
[38:00.840 --> 38:03.580]  just to keep up with, you know, oh, we'll move the old one
[38:03.580 --> 38:05.460]  to the living room, put a new one in it, you know,
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.700]  or an old one to the bedroom
[38:06.700 --> 38:08.340]  and put a new one in the living room.
[38:08.340 --> 38:11.060]  No one's gonna do that with actual TV sets.
[38:11.060 --> 38:13.980]  And I do feel, I feel like there are tremendous advantages
[38:13.980 --> 38:16.740]  that Apple is going to bring to bear on this market.
[38:16.740 --> 38:18.740]  And when it comes to games and stuff like that,
[38:18.740 --> 38:20.800]  by having these A series chips
[38:20.800 --> 38:23.600]  that get so much faster year over year.
[38:23.600 --> 38:26.620]  And that only makes sense if Apple TV is a box,
[38:26.620 --> 38:27.900]  not an actual TV set.
[38:28.820 --> 38:30.140]  Yeah, and it's gonna be a while
[38:30.140 --> 38:33.140]  before the actual screens themselves
[38:33.140 --> 38:35.020]  have such a leap in technology
[38:35.020 --> 38:36.640]  that only one company's doing it
[38:36.640 --> 38:38.180]  and you have to go with that company.
[38:38.180 --> 38:39.020]  Right.
[38:39.020 --> 38:41.060]  Something like, you know, stereo without glasses
[38:41.060 --> 38:42.220]  or something like that.
[38:42.220 --> 38:45.780]  Otherwise, higher resolution, fine, you know,
[38:45.780 --> 38:49.020]  4K TV, you can't really tell the difference
[38:49.020 --> 38:51.900]  from, you know, a certain distance away from it.
[38:51.900 --> 38:54.280]  So the other ones are really good
[38:54.280 --> 38:55.980]  and they're very cost effective.
[38:55.980 --> 39:00.020]  You can get just a really, really good, you know,
[39:00.020 --> 39:04.660]  50, 60 inch TV for three, four, $500 now.
[39:04.660 --> 39:06.360]  That's crazy, blows my mind.
[39:06.360 --> 39:07.200]  All right, hold on a thought.
[39:07.200 --> 39:09.120]  It'd remind me when I'm gonna take a break here
[39:09.120 --> 39:10.340]  and thank a sponsor.
[39:10.340 --> 39:13.820]  I wanna talk about 4K when we come back and I'll forget.
[39:13.820 --> 39:16.460]  But it's a funny coincidence.
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.600]  You were saying, wouldn't it be great
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.580]  if Apple just made a TV
[39:18.580 --> 39:20.340]  that was a piece of glass without a frame?
[39:20.340 --> 39:21.180]  Well, guess what?
[39:21.180 --> 39:22.580]  It doesn't play TV.
[39:22.580 --> 39:24.780]  But our first sponsor is Fracture.
[39:24.780 --> 39:27.680]  Do that for your still photography.
[39:28.980 --> 39:29.820]  You guys know Fracture.
[39:29.820 --> 39:32.540]  They have sponsored this show for a long time now
[39:32.540 --> 39:33.460]  on a frequent basis.
[39:33.460 --> 39:34.300]  They're the company.
[39:34.300 --> 39:36.380]  You send them, you go to their website,
[39:36.380 --> 39:39.100]  you give them your still photos and you pick a size
[39:39.100 --> 39:41.580]  and then they print them on the back,
[39:41.580 --> 39:42.820]  right on a piece of glass.
[39:42.820 --> 39:45.100]  They just print the photo right on this glass
[39:45.100 --> 39:46.280]  and then they mail it to you
[39:46.280 --> 39:47.620]  in a really cool little package
[39:47.620 --> 39:49.180]  and then you hang this thing,
[39:49.180 --> 39:51.140]  hang these pictures up all over your house
[39:51.140 --> 39:52.220]  and they're beautiful
[39:52.220 --> 39:54.060]  and they're really high quality prints.
[39:54.060 --> 39:56.140]  It's not a piece of paper stuck to the glass.
[39:56.140 --> 39:57.180]  It's not a frame.
[39:57.180 --> 39:58.900]  It's a piece of glass
[39:58.900 --> 40:02.780]  and they have some kind of proprietary technology.
[40:02.780 --> 40:04.100]  They call it the fractory
[40:04.100 --> 40:06.120]  down in beautiful Gainesville, Florida
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.180]  where they print these things.
[40:09.580 --> 40:11.620]  So great, so convenient, so beautiful.
[40:11.620 --> 40:12.540]  No border.
[40:12.540 --> 40:13.820]  You don't need a frame around this.
[40:13.820 --> 40:15.220]  You don't need to put it in a frame.
[40:15.220 --> 40:16.140]  There is no frame around.
[40:16.140 --> 40:17.260]  Just a piece of glass,
[40:17.260 --> 40:20.260]  border to border with your pictures on it.
[40:20.260 --> 40:21.680]  Now they wanna thank all of you.
[40:21.680 --> 40:23.360]  They want me to thank all of you.
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.940]  The reason they keep sponsoring our show
[40:25.940 --> 40:30.100]  is that you guys keep buying these pictures from them.
[40:30.100 --> 40:30.920]  I don't blame you.
[40:30.920 --> 40:31.940]  They're great.
[40:31.940 --> 40:32.780]  We buy them too.
[40:32.780 --> 40:34.580]  They wanna thank you for your support
[40:35.500 --> 40:37.320]  but they want me to remind you
[40:37.320 --> 40:40.580]  that if you're gonna buy these as gifts
[40:40.580 --> 40:41.620]  for the holiday season
[40:41.620 --> 40:45.380]  and you should because these are just the best gifts.
[40:45.380 --> 40:48.940]  If you've got kids or pets or something like that
[40:48.940 --> 40:51.900]  where you can just give somebody in your life
[40:51.900 --> 40:54.840]  a picture of people in your family,
[40:54.840 --> 40:57.060]  great, great gift, really great.
[40:57.060 --> 41:00.040]  They want you to go ahead, just do it now.
[41:00.040 --> 41:01.220]  Take like half an hour.
[41:01.220 --> 41:03.820]  Find the best pictures you've taken in the last year
[41:04.940 --> 41:06.140]  and send them to Fracture.
[41:06.140 --> 41:07.940]  Do it now in early November
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.220]  because they print these things fast
[41:11.220 --> 41:13.540]  but they fall behind in the holiday season
[41:13.540 --> 41:17.740]  because most of us procrastinate on buying our holiday gifts
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.820]  and they'll tell you when you go to the site,
[41:19.820 --> 41:22.940]  whatever day you're listening to this broadcast,
[41:22.940 --> 41:23.760]  you can go there
[41:23.760 --> 41:26.740]  and they give you like an estimated shipping date
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.460]  and if you do it now in early November,
[41:28.460 --> 41:29.420]  it'll happen, no problem.
[41:29.420 --> 41:30.460]  You'll get it in a couple of days
[41:30.460 --> 41:33.240]  but do it now because if you wait till like mid-December,
[41:33.240 --> 41:36.580]  you're gonna run up to, wow, maybe or maybe not,
[41:36.580 --> 41:39.220]  it'll get to you before whatever holiday it is
[41:39.220 --> 41:41.920]  that you're hoping to get it delivered by.
[41:41.920 --> 41:44.040]  So just do it now and what a relief it'll be
[41:44.040 --> 41:46.380]  to get it off your back
[41:46.380 --> 41:48.180]  that you've got all these people
[41:48.180 --> 41:50.060]  to get gifts for for the holiday season.
[41:50.060 --> 41:52.760]  It's an easy gift to buy.
[41:52.760 --> 41:57.540]  It is a gift that makes people really happy but do it now.
[41:57.540 --> 41:58.460]  So here's the important part.
[41:58.460 --> 42:00.520]  You remember this code, daring fireball.
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.660]  Use that and you'll get 15% off if it's your first order
[42:04.660 --> 42:06.980]  and go check them out at their website
[42:06.980 --> 42:10.620]  which is fractureme.com
[42:10.620 --> 42:12.380]  and remember that code, daring fireball
[42:12.380 --> 42:14.980]  and you'll save some some dough on it.
[42:14.980 --> 42:16.620]  Nice, good segue.
[42:17.900 --> 42:18.720]  Yeah, that was a great.
[42:18.720 --> 42:20.260]  They weren't even scheduled to sponsor the show.
[42:20.260 --> 42:21.780]  I just figured I'd.
[42:21.780 --> 42:23.460]  You just threw one in.
[42:23.460 --> 42:24.820]  Because that's exactly when you said that.
[42:24.820 --> 42:26.240]  I thought, wouldn't that be cool if Apple,
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.000]  I was imagining in my mind an edge to edge display
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.660]  with literally no bezel
[42:32.660 --> 42:34.580]  which you wouldn't want on a handheld device
[42:34.580 --> 42:35.940]  because you need something for your hands
[42:35.940 --> 42:39.120]  to rest your fingers on but it would be cool on a TV.
[42:40.260 --> 42:41.980]  Absolutely and it feels like,
[42:41.980 --> 42:43.660]  we can all sort of envision a future
[42:43.660 --> 42:47.340]  where screens are so ubiquitous
[42:47.340 --> 42:49.820]  that the materials that make them are
[42:49.820 --> 42:51.980]  and the materials that make them are so,
[42:54.140 --> 42:59.140]  so negligibly cheap that it's like Blade Runner time
[42:59.460 --> 43:03.060]  and every single surface you look around at is glowing.
[43:03.060 --> 43:05.260]  You were gonna talk.
[43:05.260 --> 43:09.680]  And it's a race in time to see whether that happens
[43:09.680 --> 43:12.580]  or whether we all have augmented reality displays
[43:12.580 --> 43:15.580]  on our faces and we don't even need
[43:15.580 --> 43:16.880]  physical screens anymore.
[43:18.720 --> 43:20.460]  Friend of the show, yeah, 4K.
[43:20.460 --> 43:21.800]  Friend of the show, Todd.
[43:24.540 --> 43:25.360]  Todd Ziri?
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.320]  Todd Ziri, who works, as they say, in the industry.
[43:28.320 --> 43:32.140]  He does visual effects.
[43:34.840 --> 43:36.360]  He is a listener of the show.
[43:36.360 --> 43:38.800]  He wrote in, Guy and I were talking about 4K
[43:38.800 --> 43:41.960]  and I was maybe in response to my link
[43:41.960 --> 43:44.400]  to Abdul's thing about hey, maybe Apple will wait
[43:44.400 --> 43:47.680]  till there's this industry transition to 4K
[43:49.160 --> 43:50.320]  to make their move into it.
[43:50.320 --> 43:51.800]  Maybe if they do do a TV set,
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.880]  that'll be the time they do it
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.040]  because people would be in a mood to upgrade or whatever.
[43:56.040 --> 43:57.720]  Todd told me something I did not know
[43:57.720 --> 43:59.840]  which is that an awful lot of movies,
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.580]  even very recent ones, are not mastered in 4K.
[44:05.760 --> 44:07.720]  And you probably know a lot about this.
[44:09.200 --> 44:14.200]  Yeah, 4K is a great capturing resolution
[44:15.560 --> 44:17.920]  and often you'll do it, there are cameras
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.480]  that shoot 4K or 6K and oftentimes you'll shoot in 4K
[44:23.480 --> 44:26.520]  just so you have the extra resolution to play around with
[44:26.520 --> 44:28.520]  for in post.
[44:28.520 --> 44:31.180]  Like it makes it real easy to just push way in on a shot
[44:31.180 --> 44:33.280]  and get a closeup where you hadn't planned a closeup
[44:33.280 --> 44:35.440]  and you only shot a medium closeup.
[44:35.440 --> 44:36.960]  In other words, you can crop the image
[44:36.960 --> 44:38.680]  and still have enough pixels
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.320]  to get a totally usable quality picture out of it.
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.840]  Right, but you're not actually mastering in 4K
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.080]  or finishing in 4K even or doing post work in 4K
[44:50.080 --> 44:51.520]  because that's still really, really, really,
[44:51.520 --> 44:53.020]  really render intensive.
[44:53.020 --> 44:57.120]  And especially most of the stuff that we do
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.160]  is for web anyway, so why would 4K really matter?
[45:00.160 --> 45:02.520]  Right, I was vaguely aware of this
[45:02.520 --> 45:05.480]  but it didn't really occur to me.
[45:05.480 --> 45:07.860]  And the point of this being that if you're waiting
[45:07.860 --> 45:10.820]  for everything to go 4K and you have 4K in your living room
[45:10.820 --> 45:15.640]  and have 4K images streaming and stuff like that,
[45:15.640 --> 45:17.200]  it's not even an issue of the bandwidth
[45:17.200 --> 45:19.920]  of streaming in the 4K, it's that there's just not,
[45:19.920 --> 45:21.760]  it just doesn't make a lot of,
[45:21.760 --> 45:23.480]  the stuff is in 4K anyway.
[45:24.600 --> 45:26.580]  Yeah, and the trade-offs are,
[45:28.760 --> 45:30.000]  the benefits outweigh the costs.
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.420]  I think it's gonna, it's inevitable
[45:31.420 --> 45:33.520]  that it'll happen eventually.
[45:33.520 --> 45:35.040]  But eventually it might be a long time
[45:35.040 --> 45:37.080]  and that the pipeline for the visual effects
[45:37.080 --> 45:40.080]  and stuff like that, like doing everything in 4K,
[45:40.080 --> 45:41.040]  even if it, like you said,
[45:41.040 --> 45:43.160]  even if it was shot in 4K in a camera,
[45:43.160 --> 45:46.600]  doing everything for the effects and stuff like that in 4K,
[45:46.600 --> 45:48.940]  it's too much of a computational overhead.
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.200]  Yeah.
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.640]  So maybe don't hold your breath for 4K TV sets.
[45:54.640 --> 45:56.700]  Yeah, but maybe our eyes just need to evolve
[45:56.700 --> 45:58.880]  to be able to appreciate the resolution differently.
[45:58.880 --> 46:00.040]  I know that when we go back
[46:00.040 --> 46:03.000]  and look at standard depth versus high depth,
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.440]  then there's a real remarkable difference.
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.960]  But it feels like the diminishing returns
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.280]  started at 1080.
[46:12.280 --> 46:13.120]  I think so.
[46:13.120 --> 46:16.680]  And maybe it's, so maybe in other words,
[46:16.680 --> 46:18.900]  don't get your hopes up for 4K everything everywhere.
[46:18.900 --> 46:21.980]  And I think there's a lot of boo-hissing going on
[46:21.980 --> 46:25.260]  that this new Apple TV doesn't support 4K.
[46:26.120 --> 46:27.920]  And I just feel like that's,
[46:27.920 --> 46:30.120]  I sort of rolled my eyes at it,
[46:30.120 --> 46:31.360]  but now that I know a little bit more,
[46:31.360 --> 46:32.540]  I do so even more.
[46:32.540 --> 46:34.080]  Like, cause there's no way that they could,
[46:34.080 --> 46:39.080]  they can't feasibly send all of the stuff
[46:39.080 --> 46:42.320]  you get from iTunes, the iTunes movies and TV shows
[46:42.320 --> 46:44.200]  that you buy or rent or whatever.
[46:44.200 --> 46:45.820]  They can't send them in 4K.
[46:45.820 --> 46:48.400]  So why, what's the point?
[46:48.400 --> 46:49.440]  If you're just gonna be watching
[46:49.440 --> 46:51.580]  upscale 1080p stuff anyway.
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.020]  I'm looking forward to when they support stereo stuff,
[46:56.020 --> 46:57.480]  you know, 3D stuff.
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.440]  Cause I do, I do enjoy that.
[46:59.440 --> 47:04.440]  I do enjoy, I have a couple of the TVs are 3D,
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.240]  I have a projector and it's a 3D projector
[47:10.240 --> 47:12.640]  and you know, with glasses and the whole thing.
[47:12.640 --> 47:17.080]  And there are actually with like, with these smart TVs,
[47:17.080 --> 47:22.080]  there are apps out there that just serve 3D content
[47:22.940 --> 47:25.180]  or stream 3D content or the,
[47:25.180 --> 47:27.140]  like if you buy a Sony Blu-ray player,
[47:28.120 --> 47:29.720]  you can put it on your wifi network
[47:29.720 --> 47:32.200]  and it'll go and grab 3D content.
[47:32.200 --> 47:35.640]  And I know that 3D is sort of at a standstill right now.
[47:35.640 --> 47:37.960]  It peaked maybe a couple of years ago
[47:37.960 --> 47:40.680]  with the amount, the number of movies
[47:40.680 --> 47:42.840]  that were being produced and distributed in 3D.
[47:42.840 --> 47:43.880]  But I don't know,
[47:43.880 --> 47:45.960]  I think there's still a lot of opportunity there.
[47:45.960 --> 47:49.200]  Even looking, like I'm staring straight ahead at the city,
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.500]  the screen savers, it's the one with the Ferris wheel.
[47:52.500 --> 47:53.880]  I don't even know what city it is, is that the town?
[47:53.880 --> 47:55.480]  Yeah, that's London.
[47:55.480 --> 47:58.280]  That's the London Eye, the Ferris wheel.
[47:58.280 --> 48:00.080]  Right, and it's beautiful.
[48:01.560 --> 48:02.880]  It's at magic hour or something.
[48:02.880 --> 48:05.520]  And I could see like, this would look stunning in 3D.
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.280]  But I, you know, the hunger isn't there yet.
[48:10.280 --> 48:11.260]  I hate 3D.
[48:12.400 --> 48:15.840]  I do, I don't, I don't, but I don't,
[48:15.840 --> 48:18.360]  I don't dispute that you like it.
[48:18.360 --> 48:19.200]  And.
[48:19.200 --> 48:22.300]  Well, I do, I mean, but I, part of that maybe,
[48:22.300 --> 48:24.680]  I don't know if your eye issue.
[48:24.680 --> 48:27.780]  No, it precedes that, because my eye issue.
[48:27.780 --> 48:30.480]  I actually have not seen a 3D movie
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.640]  in the last, whatever, nine months
[48:33.640 --> 48:36.840]  since I've had the eye issues.
[48:36.840 --> 48:39.000]  So I'm curious how that'll actually work.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.080]  Although we were at Disney and I'd watched,
[48:42.080 --> 48:45.280]  oh, you know what, that's funny that you say that.
[48:45.280 --> 48:46.120]  That's actually funny.
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.280]  I'd forgot, I had totally forgotten about this.
[48:48.280 --> 48:52.200]  So we were at Disney in July and we were watching
[48:52.200 --> 48:55.680]  one of the attractions that was 3D, like a 3D movie.
[48:56.600 --> 48:59.160]  I forget which one, it might've been Fill Our Magic.
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.040]  Do you guys have that out in California?
[49:02.040 --> 49:03.160]  No, it's a good one.
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.400]  Well, but you know, it's like a little seven minute
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.040]  3D movie and it's, you know, not even that new.
[49:11.040 --> 49:13.240]  I was probably like 15 years old.
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.360]  And at the time, in July, my, you know,
[49:16.360 --> 49:19.920]  the vision and my binocular vision combined,
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.400]  you know, both my eyes open, was really pretty crappy still.
[49:23.400 --> 49:25.920]  It's still crappy, but it's gotten better.
[49:27.920 --> 49:30.640]  It's funny, I almost cried during the movie.
[49:30.640 --> 49:32.320]  And I've seen this attraction like, I don't know,
[49:32.320 --> 49:34.580]  like 15, 20 times over the years.
[49:34.580 --> 49:39.220]  It was the best I've seen since my left eye went bad.
[49:40.200 --> 49:42.320]  It was weird, but I thought, I actually went into it
[49:42.320 --> 49:43.400]  thinking, I'll bet this is gonna,
[49:43.400 --> 49:45.320]  I bet I'm not even gonna see it in 3D.
[49:46.200 --> 49:47.440]  And in fact, it was the opposite.
[49:47.440 --> 49:48.860]  It was actually the best I'd seen
[49:48.860 --> 49:51.720]  with both my eyes open, period.
[49:52.720 --> 49:53.680]  That's super cool.
[49:53.680 --> 49:56.720]  I also had like, you know, this,
[49:56.720 --> 49:59.800]  I developed an eye problem in the same eye
[49:59.800 --> 50:01.600]  at the same time that you did.
[50:01.600 --> 50:06.600]  My retina kind of exploded and it's like recuperating now,
[50:06.720 --> 50:09.960]  but you know, still like almost a year ago this happened.
[50:09.960 --> 50:13.080]  And that was one of the first things that came to mind
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.120]  was, oh shoot, I'm not gonna be able to appreciate,
[50:16.120 --> 50:21.040]  you know, stereo, like 3D movies or virtual reality
[50:21.040 --> 50:23.640]  just as it started and it come to the forefront.
[50:23.640 --> 50:26.360]  But what's interesting about that is that you,
[50:27.800 --> 50:29.560]  because of where you put the display,
[50:29.560 --> 50:32.680]  when you put a VR headset on your face,
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.280]  the display is literally like, you know,
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.000]  centimeters from your eye or millimeters.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  And my vision is, my near focused vision
[50:44.080 --> 50:46.480]  is like a lot better than, you know,
[50:46.480 --> 50:49.200]  the distortion that happens from the retinal issue
[50:49.200 --> 50:53.840]  is a lot worse in the distance than it is near focus.
[50:53.840 --> 50:55.760]  So I can actually probably see better
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.460]  through virtual reality display than I can in actual,
[50:59.460 --> 51:00.300]  in the world.
[51:00.300 --> 51:02.440]  Yeah, I have not tried a VR headset recently
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.880]  and I suspect that for me, again,
[51:05.880 --> 51:10.520]  the show monthly devolves into an ophthalmology show.
[51:10.520 --> 51:14.120]  But I have two issues with my left eye.
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.680]  One is I had a cataract and it was removed
[51:16.680 --> 51:18.160]  and so I have an artificial, you know,
[51:18.160 --> 51:21.800]  like what old people get in their eye is the focusing lens
[51:21.800 --> 51:24.600]  and it's completely inflexible, completely inflexible
[51:24.600 --> 51:27.360]  because it's just an artificial, you know, plastic lens.
[51:28.600 --> 51:31.960]  And so when I have my contact lenses or my glasses on,
[51:31.960 --> 51:35.080]  I can't focus on anything within arm's length with that eye
[51:35.080 --> 51:36.840]  because I need reading glasses because it's,
[51:36.840 --> 51:41.200]  effectively I have like a 70 year old's short vision.
[51:41.200 --> 51:43.600]  If I take my glasses off, I can see up close,
[51:43.600 --> 51:45.200]  I can focus with it really close.
[51:45.200 --> 51:46.840]  Then the second problem is with the retina
[51:46.840 --> 51:48.000]  where everything is distorted.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.720]  When it is in focus, it's distorted.
[51:50.720 --> 51:54.940]  So my guess is for VR, my guess is that it will work for me
[51:54.940 --> 51:56.680]  and maybe it'll work very well
[51:56.680 --> 51:58.280]  and just like watching 3D movies,
[51:58.280 --> 52:01.380]  it might actually be the best thing that I see, period.
[52:02.560 --> 52:04.920]  But I think I'll have to take my glasses off
[52:04.920 --> 52:06.720]  and I think if I'm wearing my contact lenses,
[52:06.720 --> 52:08.320]  it's not, I'm not gonna be able to focus
[52:08.320 --> 52:11.920]  because it's so close, but we'll see.
[52:11.920 --> 52:14.120]  I don't know, I haven't tried it.
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.680]  Yeah, it'll take some experimentation and you might,
[52:16.680 --> 52:20.200]  I mean, who knows if VR is prevalent enough
[52:20.200 --> 52:23.520]  and they might be able to just custom speak a headset
[52:23.520 --> 52:24.360]  to your eyesight.
[52:24.360 --> 52:26.000]  Right, or maybe there's some kind of calibration step
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.920]  I can go through that would handle that.
[52:29.920 --> 52:32.160]  Cause that actually has occurred to me too for VR.
[52:32.160 --> 52:34.080]  Cause I did, I had this same thing that,
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.560]  you and I have talked about this privately,
[52:35.560 --> 52:38.160]  but we went through these issues where we had this,
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.480]  both of us had one eye go bad around the same time.
[52:40.480 --> 52:42.920]  And we're both sort of technology and movie
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.280]  and game enthusiasts.
[52:44.280 --> 52:47.040]  We're not really game, but you know what I mean.
[52:47.040 --> 52:49.440]  And it's like, we're just getting to the point
[52:49.440 --> 52:51.960]  where VR headsets are gonna be commonplace
[52:51.960 --> 52:56.960]  and all of a sudden I might not be able to see 3D.
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.800]  But I think, I actually think it might be the opposite.
[52:59.800 --> 53:03.080]  I actually think that I might be able to see better 3D
[53:03.080 --> 53:06.640]  with a headset than I see in a real living breathing
[53:06.640 --> 53:08.200]  three-dimensional world 3D.
[53:09.320 --> 53:11.880]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, who knows?
[53:11.880 --> 53:15.200]  Just biomechanics might just catch up
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.140]  with our physical failings as we age.
[53:19.140 --> 53:19.980]  That would be pretty cool.
[53:19.980 --> 53:20.800]  I've said this before.
[53:20.800 --> 53:22.160]  I've said on the show, I don't know if you've listened,
[53:22.160 --> 53:24.520]  but my problem with 3D movies is that when I watch
[53:24.520 --> 53:27.340]  a 3D movie, a 3D feature film,
[53:29.200 --> 53:32.760]  I find it mentally exhausting in a weird way.
[53:32.760 --> 53:34.760]  As though my brain is holding its breath
[53:34.760 --> 53:35.580]  through the whole thing.
[53:35.580 --> 53:38.440]  And I walk out inevitably and I don't remember
[53:38.440 --> 53:39.840]  the second half of the movie.
[53:40.880 --> 53:43.760]  And then when I said this, I got some links from people
[53:43.760 --> 53:45.400]  and of course I don't have them handy here,
[53:45.400 --> 53:50.400]  but that's a real thing that it taxes your brain in a way.
[53:52.480 --> 53:55.280]  And for some people it's different than others.
[53:55.280 --> 53:56.800]  But for me, it's definitely the case.
[53:56.800 --> 54:01.800]  And so that's why at Disney World,
[54:01.800 --> 54:04.400]  going into an attraction where there's a seven minute
[54:04.400 --> 54:05.840]  3D movie, I love it.
[54:05.840 --> 54:08.440]  And a lot of them, I can watch them over and over
[54:08.440 --> 54:09.920]  and over again every year.
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.720]  And I enjoy it and I find the 3D to be exhilarating
[54:14.720 --> 54:17.400]  and fun and everything it's supposed to be.
[54:17.400 --> 54:20.040]  And then for like watching an entire 90 minute,
[54:20.040 --> 54:22.560]  two hour feature film, I find it,
[54:24.080 --> 54:27.640]  I just find it like I go into like a blackout.
[54:27.640 --> 54:28.960]  Like I just come out and I'm like,
[54:28.960 --> 54:31.000]  what the hell happened there?
[54:31.000 --> 54:32.720]  Yeah, you can't really think as well
[54:32.720 --> 54:35.680]  because the light is being cut essentially in half.
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.680]  And it's like being, you know how it's like, I don't know,
[54:41.520 --> 54:44.520]  if you're walking around outside and it's nighttime,
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.360]  you're fine.
[54:45.360 --> 54:47.040]  If you're walking around outside and it's daytime,
[54:47.040 --> 54:47.880]  you're fine.
[54:47.880 --> 54:51.160]  But if it's like that middle, if it's sundown
[54:51.160 --> 54:54.000]  and it's not quite day or night,
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.560]  then your brain is trying to figure out
[54:55.560 --> 54:56.400]  what sense to make of the world.
[54:56.400 --> 54:59.040]  They taught me in Driver's Ed that that's actually
[54:59.040 --> 55:02.520]  the most common time of the day for car accidents by far.
[55:02.520 --> 55:03.360]  Absolutely.
[55:03.360 --> 55:04.200]  Right, absolutely.
[55:05.320 --> 55:08.160]  The way they, you know, like anything in Driver's Ed,
[55:08.160 --> 55:09.760]  they scare the crap out of you.
[55:09.760 --> 55:13.800]  They made it seem like if you're driving at sundown
[55:13.800 --> 55:16.440]  that you will like most likely die.
[55:16.440 --> 55:17.400]  You probably won't be.
[55:17.400 --> 55:18.640]  You will be decapitated.
[55:18.640 --> 55:20.880]  That is when you will be, that's the decapitation.
[55:20.880 --> 55:22.720]  It's a combination of like you said,
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.680]  like it's your eyes are like adjusted,
[55:25.680 --> 55:28.920]  your eyes are on daylight so they don't see so good.
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.560]  Whereas opposed to like in the middle of the night
[55:30.560 --> 55:33.560]  when it's totally dark, your eyes are fully dilated
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.800]  and whatever else goes on in there to adjust to low light.
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.120]  It's all set for low light.
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.200]  And then the other factor they said was that
[55:40.200 --> 55:42.200]  lots of people don't turn their headlines on yet
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.640]  because they don't need the headlights to see
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.880]  but the headlights are there so you can see them
[55:46.880 --> 55:48.240]  and people don't know that.
[55:49.440 --> 55:50.280]  Right.
[55:50.280 --> 55:55.280]  You know, so I went to, you definitely will.
[55:55.560 --> 55:56.560]  I went to this,
[55:56.560 --> 55:59.600]  I went to a screening,
[55:59.600 --> 56:02.000]  I think it was like the Director's Guild Theater
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.760]  so here in L.A.
[56:03.760 --> 56:06.480]  Cause John August was a part of this panel
[56:06.480 --> 56:08.280]  on like technology and film or something.
[56:08.280 --> 56:09.340]  It was really cool.
[56:09.340 --> 56:12.560]  And they showed a 3D projection
[56:12.560 --> 56:13.400]  and I don't remember what it was.
[56:13.400 --> 56:16.560]  It was maybe the Star Trek movie that had just come out.
[56:16.560 --> 56:18.040]  But the projector that they have,
[56:18.040 --> 56:19.600]  the system that they have in this theater
[56:19.600 --> 56:22.200]  is so advanced that it doesn't cut any of the light.
[56:23.040 --> 56:25.020]  And that made all the difference in the world
[56:25.020 --> 56:28.400]  between good 3D, like what 3D is supposed to be
[56:28.400 --> 56:30.600]  and what most of us think of it is
[56:30.600 --> 56:33.400]  which is, you know, periodically through the film
[56:33.400 --> 56:35.640]  you're like sort of taking the glasses off
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.320]  and looking at what the picture looks like for real.
[56:39.320 --> 56:41.320]  And you realize how much brighter it is
[56:41.320 --> 56:43.160]  as it's coming out of the projector.
[56:43.160 --> 56:44.880]  And you're like, damn, why can't it look like this?
[56:44.880 --> 56:46.380]  Why can't it be this bright?
[56:47.520 --> 56:50.520]  So who knows when that technology's gonna advance
[56:50.520 --> 56:53.940]  to the point that it's not a terrible experience anymore.
[56:53.940 --> 56:54.780]  Pretty soon.
[56:54.780 --> 56:56.320]  Do you have any tickets for Star Wars yet?
[56:57.520 --> 57:00.760]  I didn't, but you know,
[57:00.760 --> 57:02.960]  I'm not really part of the whole frenzy
[57:02.960 --> 57:05.000]  as much as I think most people are.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.240]  You only just saw Star Wars the first time,
[57:07.240 --> 57:08.440]  like a handful of years.
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.440]  Yeah, I might not have seen the whole movies as an adult.
[57:14.560 --> 57:16.480]  I can't really be too sure.
[57:16.480 --> 57:18.280]  I laugh because for those of us
[57:18.280 --> 57:20.000]  who are really, really looking forward to it,
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.360]  it's like you have to like buy these tickets in advance
[57:23.360 --> 57:26.360]  or else you're like stuck waiting a week or two.
[57:26.360 --> 57:27.400]  Yeah.
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.440]  And like on the ATP podcast,
[57:31.440 --> 57:33.320]  John Siracusa, an episode ago,
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.900]  he and his wife were both trying to get these tickets
[57:38.900 --> 57:40.960]  for the opening day and his wife,
[57:40.960 --> 57:43.840]  and the Fandango website was totally,
[57:43.840 --> 57:45.600]  you know, it was like the old days of the Apple store
[57:45.600 --> 57:47.980]  or like when you buy your iPhones, it just crapped out.
[57:47.980 --> 57:49.640]  I mean, it just absolutely was,
[57:49.640 --> 57:53.080]  it was like given like weird like PHP errors
[57:53.080 --> 57:55.840]  and HTP error codes that you never even see.
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.000]  It was like, you know, HTP error code 517,
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.360]  server, you know, fainted.
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.000]  You know, it's like, I didn't know that was any HTTP spec.
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  Uh, you know, HTP error code 607, server went for a drink.
[58:17.320 --> 58:19.160]  But anyways, wife got through, got some tickets,
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.540]  but they were 3D.
[58:20.540 --> 58:21.940]  And it's like, you don't want to, you know,
[58:21.940 --> 58:23.560]  it was like, well, she got what she could get,
[58:23.560 --> 58:25.120]  but it's like, he didn't want to see 3D.
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.120]  But I heard him say it was actually pretty smart.
[58:27.120 --> 58:29.080]  I can actually see doing this where he's, you know,
[58:29.080 --> 58:31.600]  he's fixed it, he's rectified it so that like
[58:31.600 --> 58:34.680]  his opening weekend tickets for, you know, taking his kids,
[58:34.680 --> 58:35.960]  and then he's going to go with some friends,
[58:35.960 --> 58:39.520]  they're all 2D, but that he might go see
[58:39.520 --> 58:42.380]  if the movie's any good, if it holds up
[58:42.380 --> 58:43.320]  and it was worth seeing again,
[58:43.320 --> 58:44.760]  then maybe if he goes see it a third time,
[58:44.760 --> 58:48.080]  he will go see it in 3D because he's already seen it.
[58:48.080 --> 58:49.760]  And I could see, I could totally see doing that.
[58:49.760 --> 58:52.120]  My feelings on 3D are such that if the Star Wars movie
[58:52.120 --> 58:54.760]  is good and we decide to go see it again,
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.940]  I would go see it in 3D because I feel like
[58:56.940 --> 58:58.620]  that would also alleviate my,
[58:58.620 --> 58:59.840]  I don't know what the hell's going on
[58:59.840 --> 59:01.200]  because I'll already know what's going on
[59:01.200 --> 59:02.360]  because I saw it in 2D.
[59:03.480 --> 59:05.720]  Yeah, that's interesting that 3D will get in the way
[59:05.720 --> 59:07.920]  of the story for you in a way.
[59:07.920 --> 59:09.420]  It's totally counterintuitive.
[59:09.420 --> 59:10.720]  I would think it's the opposite,
[59:10.720 --> 59:12.560]  that everybody's clamoring for the 3D.
[59:12.560 --> 59:14.360]  Well, that's, it's definitely the case
[59:14.360 --> 59:16.160]  that there are way more 3D showings.
[59:16.160 --> 59:18.280]  Like the 2D is sort of the niche showing.
[59:18.280 --> 59:20.240]  And it's funny because I mean, some places,
[59:20.240 --> 59:21.640]  I don't know, I don't know if they always charge more
[59:21.640 --> 59:24.640]  for 3D, I know they charge more for IMAX in 3D.
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.480]  So it's actually cheaper, but it seems like it's sort of
[59:28.480 --> 59:31.520]  the, it's sort of the, I don't know.
[59:33.600 --> 59:36.800]  It's the one that if you care, you're going to the 2D.
[59:36.800 --> 59:37.900]  Like it seems.
[59:37.900 --> 59:40.800]  Yeah, the purest, the Star Wars purest will go to 2D.
[59:40.800 --> 59:43.160]  And you don't think that that scarcity is artificial.
[59:43.160 --> 59:46.480]  You don't think that they'll somehow miraculously open up
[59:46.480 --> 59:50.480]  a few thousand more seats the day after it premieres?
[59:50.480 --> 59:51.880]  I don't know, I wonder.
[59:51.880 --> 59:54.320]  I do, it just seems weird to me.
[59:54.320 --> 59:55.480]  It's like one of those things where it's like,
[59:55.480 --> 59:58.440]  I don't go, ever since I had a kid,
[59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.680]  I don't go to the cinema as much as I used to.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.340]  I used to go, it was like the default thing to do
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.520]  on any Friday or Saturday night is, let's go find a movie.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.120]  Wasn't even like, I knew what movies are out.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  It was like, let's just go see the movie in a theater
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.660]  that looks like the most appealing at the moment.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.620]  So we don't go to movies that often, not much anymore.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.420]  We watch a lot more of them at home,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.880]  which of course will bring us back to Apple TV.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.400]  But it still seems weird to me
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.120]  to buy movie tickets in advance.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.840]  It seems to me like if a movie's popular,
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.960]  and then this is, I'm just being a curmudgeon,
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.760]  but it just feels to me like you should not be able
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.000]  to buy tickets in advance.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.240]  You should have to go wait in line.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.080]  Well, we do it here and in probably a lot of big cities
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.680]  with the arc light or stadium seating theaters,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.480]  because you, like I know exactly what seat and row
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.120]  I wanna sit in in the theater.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.880]  And so at the arc light, you can pick your seat in advance.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.720]  And that's always very important.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.560]  Yeah, I feel like it should be one way or the other.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.960]  It should either be all the way
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.400]  to where you get reserved seats.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.940]  And we have two sets of tickets for the Star Wars.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.960]  The first night, I think it's general seating.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.440]  And then we have another one, like a Saturday matinee
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.240]  at a place with reserved seating,
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.040]  which I'm really looking forward to.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.320]  Because I'm kind of worried that the opening night one,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.760]  we're not gonna get good seats.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.000]  But, hmm.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.920]  I love the idea of Siracusa just in a panic,
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.880]  in a sweat panic that he can't get tickets.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.320]  And then he remembers, oh my God, Fandango has a watch app.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.520]  And then he just launches the watch app.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.320]  And it just shows him a movie quote.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.080]  And it's just like a big fake,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.440]  it's a big old fuck you to those movie fans.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.440]  It just has a quote.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.560]  Just like, it's a quote from Dumb and Dumber
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.800]  and a guy with his middle finger.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.000]  All right, let me take another break here.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.760]  And we'll get back to talking about Apple TV.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.840]  And let me tell you about Automattic.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840]  You guys know Automattic,
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.840]  that's another long time sponsor of the show.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.320]  They make a really cool connected car adapter.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.360]  I call it a dingus.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.800]  I think it's better to call it a dingus.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.160]  They call it an adapter.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.060]  It plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.280]  Every car since 1996 has one of these ports.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.320]  It's a standard port.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.600]  It's like the car equivalent of like HDMI or USB
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.240]  or something like that.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.800]  Standard port.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.640]  Everybody, all these cars have them.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.600]  I mean, if your car's older than 96,
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.800]  I mean, I guess I can't help you.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.720]  But anything since, you just plug this thing in,
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.120]  it pairs with your phone,
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.760]  and then you use Bluetooth that connects to your phone.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.960]  And it makes your driving experience better.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.800]  What does it do?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.800]  Well, one thing it does
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.500]  is because it is a diagnostic port,
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.880]  anything that goes wrong with your car,
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.360]  anything that puts like a get service,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.560]  it serves like service,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.480]  get you overdue for service A3.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.920]  Well, you wanna know what service A3 is,
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.380]  the Automattic will tell you what it is.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.000]  If like an engine light comes on,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.040]  instead of just like engine light, go get help.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.360]  It'll tell you exactly what's wrong.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.960]  So you can tell, oh man, this is totally serious
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.340]  or oh, this isn't that bad.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.500]  I can just wait till tomorrow and I'll take it in tomorrow.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.020]  In plain English, it'll tell you exactly what's going on
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.120]  instead of just having like a on or off,
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.000]  check engine, come on.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.760]  That's really cool.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.400]  It gives you a log of your trips.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.240]  It tells you if you want how well you're driving
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.600]  in terms of your efficiency.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.880]  So you can set goals for what kind of fuel efficiency
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.520]  you're looking for and it can tell you live
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.760]  whether you're doing a good job or not
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.680]  or whether you're a little heavy on the gas.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.680]  It can even do things like make emergency calls.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.840]  God forbid, if you ever got into like a car accident
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.800]  or something like that and couldn't call yourself,
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.440]  it can take care of that for you.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.440]  Because it has GPS or your phone has GPS at least,
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.400]  it can do things like remind you where you parked your car.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.600]  So go to like a big stadium or something like that
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.200]  and you can't remember where the hell your car is,
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.860]  it'll tell you where it is.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.600]  Really, really convenient.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.240]  They've added so much stuff over the last year.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.960]  They have like what they call the App Store for automatic
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.100]  and they have over 20 apps available that you can get.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.920]  So here's an example, Nest.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.440]  You got a Nest thermometer in your house.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.420]  Well, then you can connect it with your automatic
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.280]  and have it set to do something when you get
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.680]  within say 10 miles of your house.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.020]  So you're driving home, have it set up so that
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.640]  when you're seven miles away,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.760]  turn the air conditioning off or on I guess it would be
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.340]  or turn the heat on in the winter or something like that.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.000]  Really cool stuff that you can do like that.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.160]  They integrate with IFTTT, If This Then That,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.720]  which is a really cool website that gives you these recipes
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.540]  where you can hook things up to all sorts of things.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.420]  Really, really cool, great way to geek out with your car.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:55.220]  Really, really fun.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.420]  Everybody should have one of these things.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.680]  And here's the best part.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.280]  It's normally just 100 bucks,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.240]  which is cheap in and of itself.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.560]  There is no service fee.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.120]  You just buy this thing for 100 bucks,
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.600]  stick it in your car, pair it to your phone
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.900]  and you can use it.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.440]  Never have to pay another nickel.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.040]  But here's the best part.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.920]  Use their code, go here and go automatic.com
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.160]  slash the talk show, spell it out, the talk show.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.000]  And you'll save 20% off, that's 20 bucks
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.040]  just for being a listener of this show.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.960]  Ships in two business days
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.960]  and they have a 45 day return policy.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.700]  No questions asked.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.980]  So buy it for 80 bucks.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.600]  You have 45 days to decide if it's worth it or not.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:40.900]  And if it's not, just send it back,
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.460]  but you won't send it back, it's that cool.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.680]  So my thanks to Automattic,
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.260]  go check them out at automatic.com slash the talk show.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.680]  All right, what else is on your mind with Apple TV?
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.720]  Well, you know, sort of like I'm into the bigger picture
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.720]  stuff because when you, I think the most interesting thing
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.880]  to do with it is really to browse through the app store
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.480]  and figure out what it means to be an app
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.520]  in the context of this device.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.280]  Because it's not the same as what an app means
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:17.280]  on the app store for iOS or for the iPhone or iPad.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280]  It's not the same as a watch,
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.240]  not the same as the Mac app store.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.080]  It's something new.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.200]  And I think that people haven't really
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.400]  wrapped their heads around what it means.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.240]  Yeah, and I think it was the most true
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.780]  with the iPhone early on.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.160]  I don't think the iPad quite had this problem
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.420]  because by the time the iPad came out,
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.680]  the basic idea of, well, it's a big iPhone
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.380]  was close enough that developers kind of got it.
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.680]  And there wasn't this period where people didn't know
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.040]  what an iPad app was,
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.800]  but with the iPhone there definitely was.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.920]  And in the early days,
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.760]  a lot of them were just sort of like,
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.900]  I don't know, like websites,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.240]  like websites that were packed onto a phone.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.240]  And it took a while before people could figure this out.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.920]  Yes, and it's funny just because the first thing
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.520]  we always do with a new sort of medium
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.480]  is try to translate the old medium to the new one.
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.720]  That goes for stage to screen,
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.880]  or stage to movies, to radio, to TV.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.680]  That's the way it works.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.040]  When you look at an old Jackie Gleason-era TV show,
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040]  it really just looks like they stuck a camera
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.700]  in front of a stage.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.420]  Exactly.
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.280]  It doesn't mean that they weren't funny,
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.680]  and it doesn't mean that they weren't great performers,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.640]  but they just hadn't really mastered the medium yet.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.880]  Because they haven't reframed it,
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.040]  or they haven't developed the new language around it yet.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.440]  So one of the revelatory things for me,
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.140]  browsing through the App Store when I set it up,
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.360]  was like, I saw, oh, there's a fireplace app.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.400]  And then skipped ahead a few pages.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.600]  Oh, there's another fireplace app.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.080]  And then there's this downpour of fireplace apps.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.720]  There's like a million of them already.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.320]  And it dawned on me that the fireplace app
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.480]  is really like the fart app for the Apple TV.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.780]  Except that it's charming.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.600]  It's meant to be charming and soothing
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.740]  and put you in a good mood and maybe let you
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:18.120]  and a loved one relax and just enjoy.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.480]  Maybe it's something you put on your TV
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:22.960]  while you both enjoy a novel or something like that.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.800]  That's right.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.620]  It is romantic.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.300]  And you can go to YouTube and find channels
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.040]  that are all fireplace all the time or whatever,
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.380]  aquariums and everything.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.940]  But it tells you exactly what this device is for.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.020]  And it's for very, very passive activities.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.480]  And it's not for anything else.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.480]  It's not meant to be used as a soundboard.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.440]  It's not for anything active.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:52.440]  I cracked up when I saw that Peacock had a giant Apple TV app
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.680]  which is like, okay, who is really doing calculations
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.440]  on their TV?
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.400]  It's hilarious to me.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.400]  And it's almost like an exercise in absurdism
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:10.400]  to put a calculator app on a TV.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.080]  And I'm glad they did it.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.560]  It's awesome.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.720]  But you're not supposed to,
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.060]  he's under no impression that there are kids
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.600]  doing their homework in the living room.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.020]  Yeah.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.540]  Dialing the math in on Peacock on the TV.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.160]  But it helps you like sort of redefine where,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.780]  yeah, I guess redefine what an app is in this context.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.240]  And an app is a mechanism for delivering content,
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.460]  like very passive content.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.520]  I guess like cool content.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.840]  Television is always supposed to have been a cool medium.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.840]  In McLuhan terms, right?
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.380]  Yeah, in McLuhan terms,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.400]  meaning you can sort of step away from it
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.800]  and you don't have to stare intently
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.500]  or be active while you're using it.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.500]  And so it's really like the most fascinating thing to me
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.180]  as a person who watches media evolve
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.500]  is seeing all the network, the major network apps.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.840]  Seeing that FX has a really cool app
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.200]  that all their shows are on or Fox or NBC
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.960]  and that all the networks are like now
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.040]  they're pretty much on board with this.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.680]  There are a couple that are dinosaurs
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.580]  and are late to the game
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.360]  and like won't enable their content yet
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.920]  through streaming devices.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.440]  But for the most part, they're on there.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.880]  And what you have to do
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.560]  is you have to subscribe to a cable provider,
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.900]  which I did when we moved into our house.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.200]  I set up a cable subscription
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.280]  at the lowest amount you could possibly buy into,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.440]  which is like, I don't know,
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.600]  20 bucks a month or something, 20, 30 bucks a month.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.680]  Just so you can enter that code
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.120]  that unlocks the channel in the form of an app.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.860]  But the, and then like, so, okay.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.360]  So that's fascinating
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.740]  that now we can get these channels of content
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.520]  that used to be the big three,
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.840]  that used to be the only thing
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.220]  on the whole televised media landscape.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.320]  They're now accessible in this little box.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.460]  Time shifted for our enjoyment,
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:20.460]  but that they're right next to any other possible channel
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:25.220]  of media content that the kid next door could be making.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.760]  That literally anybody could make an app,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.400]  set up a camera, make content,
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.520]  make dumb YouTube videos,
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.960]  put it in an Apple TV app,
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.080]  and it's right there next to ABC's app.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.880]  I think that's fascinating.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.720]  That's evolution.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.640]  It feels to me like people are missing that.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.160]  And maybe there's other ways,
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.000]  maybe there's a way to do that on Roku or Roku,
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.360]  whatever, how do you pronounce it?
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.600]  Roku, yeah.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.400]  I mean, yeah, that's been around for,
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.500]  it's been around for a while.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.660]  We shouldn't like beat around that bush
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.400]  and pretend that Apple's the first person to enable it.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.400]  But I feel like the way and the experience
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.640]  that Apple has with an app store
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.040]  and the familiarity that anybody who's used an iPhone
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.720]  or an iPad has with the idea of,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.720]  okay, you go to the app store
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.200]  and you tap a thing to buy a thing
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.160]  and it asks you, are you sure?
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.400]  And then there it is.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.640]  They get it.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.000]  And that anybody can build it.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.440]  And the only thing you're gonna get,
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.840]  the only thing that's gonna keep you out of it
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.880]  if you wanna make your own app for Apple TV
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.560]  is whether it's inappropriate content.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.360]  But anything that's just like a kid with a YouTube channel,
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.240]  if you wanna also put, like you said,
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.200]  you wanna put your videos into their own app
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.520]  and have an app on the home screen,
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.460]  there you are right next to HBO Go.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.160]  Yeah, and I don't think they,
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.120]  it feels like they can't really censor content
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.440]  for that long. Well, they'll,
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:54.520]  I think, I saw one thing that got filtered out was,
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.440]  there's a, I forget what it's called,
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.200]  like this something, something computer club in Europe.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.880]  And it's like a hacker's group.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.520]  And their videos are about like how to like
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.320]  jailbreak iPhones and maybe other device,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.720]  and other devices too.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.180]  And Apple rejected their Apple TV app.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.680]  And that's not, it's obviously, it's not porno.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.620]  I mean, I don't even know what.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.060]  There's the argument that they're gonna censor stuff
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.080]  that would be more than R-rated
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.200]  for sexual content or something like that.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.600]  And I think clearly they would censor things
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.280]  for extreme violence.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.760]  And famously, this is a famous,
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.160]  and it's like, ooh, I don't know.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.320]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.320]  Like they have censored some apps over the years
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.040]  for, I don't know how best to call that.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.960]  Is it politics?
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.300]  But like, if there's like an app that like,
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.480]  there was like an app that tells you,
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.520]  notified you every time that an American drone
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.120]  killed somebody somewhere in the world.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.040]  And that Apple rejected that.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.520]  Too incendiary or something.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.800]  Yeah, it's like they just wanna stay out of it.
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.000]  And it's, you know.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.520]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like that's gonna last very long.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.680]  Well, but the idea.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.800]  On the media.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.400]  Well, maybe it will on Apple TV though.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.720]  Cause there is no, one of the things about Apple TV
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.260]  is because it doesn't have a web browser.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.220]  There's no open way around it.
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.880]  So like the counter argument for something like the iPhone.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.880]  And okay, they won't put the drone, you know,
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.080]  what have the US drones done today, app in the app store.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.160]  But that's not keeping you from learning about it
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.000]  on your iPhone.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.440]  Cause you can just use Safari and go to a website
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.840]  and see it, you know, somewhere else.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.760]  You just can't have an app in their store.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.360]  That their store has some level of curation
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.660]  and they're gonna keep some objectionable stuff.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.760]  Which is more than just sexual content.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.840]  And again, I think that's a debate to be had.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.400]  If it were up to me, Apple would put the drone app
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]  in the app store.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.880]  And let, you know, let people make their own decisions.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.040]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.680]  I mean, maybe they think of it differently
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.880]  cause in a piece of software as a tool or, you know,
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.480]  an app in the context of the iPhone is a tool
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.480]  for delivering information to you.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.880]  Well, I think it's just that they wanna stay away from.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.600]  I think bottom line is that it is politically charged.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.960]  And that you would say that basically,
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.960]  it is more or less a left leaning position to say,
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.040]  to question the US's, even just to question the US's
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.780]  use of drones around the world.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.640]  And it's more of a right leaning position to support it
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.960]  and say, you know, if there's some collateral damage,
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.800]  that's what it costs to keep our country safe.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.080]  To, you know, to wrap an extremely complex issue
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.760]  into very basic things.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.860]  It is, there is a sort of left right divide on this.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:52.120]  And, you know, I could just see why Apple
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.320]  wants to stay out of it.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.640]  I would.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.460]  I get it.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.240]  I mean, they wanna make the world a better place
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.240]  and they wanna play some role as the moral center for.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.120]  Right, I would bet.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.140]  In fact, I would wager extremely heavily.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.000]  I would wager thousands of dollars
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.880]  that if somebody submitted an Apple TV app
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.880]  that showed, you know, had, or on either side of it,
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.560]  really, but was devoted to say abortion politics,
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.480]  that they're not gonna put that in the app store.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.920]  And, you know, it doesn't matter which side it was on.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.840]  I don't think they're gonna put it in
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.580]  because I don't think, I think they're gonna say
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:33.320]  that's not the type of content that the app store's for.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.720]  So it's more than just sex.
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.800]  Yeah, I think a good rule of thumb would be like
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.360]  if your cable company lets it through,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.920]  then Apple should let it through.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.280]  Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.600]  But I think it's all edge cases.
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.280]  I think for the most part, though,
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.260]  anything you might reasonably want to put on Apple TV,
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.820]  you're gonna, you could put on Apple TV if you wanted to.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.300]  Yeah, I mean, it really just opens up a,
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.600]  these apps are just portals for media
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.680]  and it should just open up a portal
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.840]  to whatever kind of media you wanna dump in there.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.280]  It's, I don't know why.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.480]  That kinda sucks if they're policing it like that.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.320]  I don't feel too good about that.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.760]  I don't either, but I understand
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.000]  that there's some kind of line that has to be drawn
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.740]  at some place where Apple,
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.720]  there is a line to be drawn that I can get behind.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.700]  I really, you know.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.540]  You remember the old Faces of Death videos?
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.380]  Sure.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.760]  I mean, I laugh when I used to rent them as a teenager.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.360]  We did, we just sat there and watched them
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.880]  and laughed and laughed and laughed, but.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.120]  Oh, God, I was younger when we rented them
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:37.580]  for slumber parties and we didn't laugh.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:38.420]  We shot our pants.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.400]  Well, we did it first, but then once, you know,
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:43.920]  there's, as I progressed as a teenager,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.400]  we went from like ashen-faced, oh my God,
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.800]  to just laughing and if you don't know,
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.020]  I forget how many they made,
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.300]  but there was a series of home videos
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.640]  called Faces of Death and they were effectively snuff films
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.240]  and they had footage of, you know,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.920]  terrible things happening to people.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.920]  And, but they, some of them were clearly fake though.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.120]  It was sort of like a mix of like,
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.480]  oh my God, that looked real.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.480]  I think that was actually a car accident
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.560]  that killed somebody.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.720]  And then the next one,
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.840]  there was one where people were eating monkey brains
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.800]  and I, you know, I think the monkey brains one
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.520]  was clearly, you know, pro wrestling.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:24.760]  It was fake.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.280]  I think the genre, and I found this out recently,
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.800]  the genre of that, of Faces of Death,
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.640]  the genre that Faces of Death came out of
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.840]  was something like mondo, mondo like sensationalist
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.520]  filmmaking where, and I think it came,
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.880]  like there was a lot of it being made in Italy,
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.120]  I believe in the, in like the, in the seventies
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.480]  and early eighties where they would just,
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.480]  it was just, just a, a bacchanal of sex and violence
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.120]  in these sort of pseudo documentaries.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.480]  Like, I don't know, everything to like,
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.640]  think of in today's media, wherever you would go
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.800]  for the most, the maximum amount of titillation
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.200]  of sex and violence.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.720]  And that's where they would get their rocks off back then
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.120]  is in movies like Faces of Death.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.200]  I don't even remember whether there were, you know,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.680]  boobs in Faces of Death, but there probably were.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.840]  There had to have been.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.080]  I don't remember.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.880]  I do remember feeling a very weird,
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.800]  like low level form of guilt after having watched them.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.680]  Absolutely, they were essentially snuff films.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.480]  We just didn't know, they were very, very fake.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.640]  You go back and watch it now and you can see all the seams
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.360]  and everything, all the fake appendages.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.680]  But back then we didn't know.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.480]  And they were definitely passed off as being real.
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.200]  And I just, I just remember, I guess the guilt
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.380]  that I felt more or less was that it didn't really matter
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.400]  whether they were real or not, or it mattered
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.520]  because in a sense it was almost like
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.880]  I hoped that they weren't real
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.640]  because it would be great to know
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.920]  that nobody died in that horrible way.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.700]  But the guilt was that it didn't really matter
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:14.580]  because either way, it's the fact that I thought
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.040]  some of them could be real and that I enjoyed,
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.960]  I drew some kind of a, yeah, I found it entertaining
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.000]  and my friends and I were collectively, you know,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  having a good time watching them.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.640]  And it just felt like it made me a terrible person.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.840]  And that's how I feel when I watch a horror movie
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.040]  and I don't watch horror movies,
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.920]  but that's absolutely how I feel is like,
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.260]  why should I be getting any entertainment value
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.080]  from this person's pain, even if it's a fictional person?
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.120]  Even if you know it's fictional.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.280]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.120]  I just don't enjoy it. Well anyway,
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.400]  that's not getting on Apple TV.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.240]  No.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.600]  No, it won't be.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.200]  Just on YouTube, I guess.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.820]  No, but like, do you ever, have you thought about,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.680]  you know, the anecdote about Steve on his hospital bed
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.480]  and basically like, I forget what the line is,
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.920]  but basically telling, and I forget even-
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.920]  Isaacson. He told, but did he tell Isaacson,
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.860]  I think I cracked it?
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.800]  Well, do you think that applied here?
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.440]  Do you think that had anything to do with Apple TV?
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.120]  Um, I don't think so.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.640]  It's such a weird line and it's such a, like,
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.880]  cause it's so tempting, right?
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.680]  It's almost like, and I don't doubt,
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.020]  I have so many complaints about Isaacson's book,
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.020]  but I do not for a second question his integrity.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.840]  So I'm sure that if he says that's what Jobs told him,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.680]  I think he said we, and I don't think he said I,
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.000]  but either way, it was either,
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.960]  first person plural or first person singular,
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.320]  but that we, you know, we, I think we finally cracked it.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.920]  Maybe he said I, I'm not sure, but that's all he said.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.520]  He didn't tell him one damn thing
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.180]  about what cracking it meant.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.800]  And it's like, could you craft a better,
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.880]  like, yeah, that would just,
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.960]  and then everybody can just fill that in
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.840]  with whatever their pet dream of what Apple TV could be is,
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:20.160]  whether it's, whether it's, you know, the actual TV set
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.480]  or whether it's Apple replacing cable
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.400]  with the, you know, $15 a month bundle
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  that lets you stream all the major,
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.800]  all the major cable networks whenever you want,
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.680]  or this, you know, an app store type, you know,
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.320]  the future of TV is apps type thing.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.440]  Who knows, you know, what the hell he meant.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.160]  I don't think that this is it though.
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:42.980]  I don't know.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.960]  I mean, obviously it does feel like it was,
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.480]  it was set in sort of a fever dream state,
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.640]  but I don't know, there's a part of me
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.360]  that idealizes this, the device so much
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.560]  that thinks that this might kind of be
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.000]  what he was talking about.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.680]  And I think my thinking is this,
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.320]  that what is, like, what is the biggest problem
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.320]  that Apple seems to have had in bringing media to us?
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.400]  Like iTunes in itself as an invention
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.600]  was pretty influential, it was pretty impactful
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.740]  in the state of technology.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:29.580]  But people complain about iTunes constantly
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.040]  and people complain about the iTunes store constantly
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.780]  and it kind of sucks, the whole process sucks.
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.680]  And even with all of the resources that Apple has,
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.860]  they haven't really figured out how to do that
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.840]  very one simple elemental thing,
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.560]  which is deliver us the media
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:49.240]  that we will use to enrich our lives.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.280]  You know, you can argue that nobody
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.720]  has figured that out very well.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.920]  The cable companies still own it,
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.440]  still own the ecosystem for the most part.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.360]  There have been technology companies
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.080]  built up around delivering us media
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.020]  in smaller channels and smaller formats,
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.760]  but for the most part, not much of it is compelling.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.260]  You could say that YouTube has been the most influential,
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.440]  you know, I guess network of delivering media to us,
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.920]  like on a really, really large scale.
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.640]  But in terms of like making an actual market for that
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.340]  and a marketplace for that,
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.960]  where anybody can be connected,
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.200]  any audience member can be connected with the media
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.600]  that's gonna enrich them the most
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.280]  and speak to them the most specifically.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.240]  And I believe that the Apple TV might be the closest
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.180]  that they've come to that.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.280]  Everything else I feel like is a tool,
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.920]  a tool for work, a tool for productivity or play
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.700]  or whatever it is, you know,
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.920]  things that you use to do other things.
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:01.360]  But I think this device specifically is used
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.040]  to enrich our lives because Steve,
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.040]  if anyone knew the benefit of using the world's media
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.360]  and art and, you know, recorded art to enrich his life.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.400]  I can't help but think,
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.400]  if I have to think what he meant by,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.160]  let's assume that he wasn't in like a fever dream,
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.280]  like you said, that he really meant it.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.620]  I can't help but think that it's this other shoe
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.680]  that's yet to drop,
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.040]  which is an Apple branded streaming video package.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.000]  Pretty much, I guess like doing for TV
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.320]  what Apple Music does for music,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.440]  which is that you pay a monthly fee
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.920]  and you get to watch all these shows
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.080]  from all these participating cable networks,
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.840]  you know, and TV networks.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  I don't disagree with you.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.600]  I think that this is step one to that.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.120]  Right, and everybody, I mean this,
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.100]  and one reason, and there's so much stuff
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.520]  that Apple does that is secret
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.720]  and they try to keep everything completely secret.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.440]  But the stuff with the media negotiations
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.660]  where they have to talk to all these TV networks,
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.880]  it all leaks like a sieve
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.640]  because these TV network guys and the music people,
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.960]  they don't keep anything secret
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.280]  and they just go probably like 30 seconds
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.240]  after Eddy Cue leaves the room,
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.700]  they're on the phone talking to people
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.060]  at the Wall Street Journal about the meeting
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.320]  they just had with Apple.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.320]  I mean, so it's not a fact that they're going to do it
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.780]  because who knows, maybe they'll never
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:31.380]  quite pull it together, but it's certain as a fact
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:32.460]  that they're trying to do it.
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.260]  And I have heard, and I know I'm not the only person,
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:39.940]  but a lot of people have heard that over the last year
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.200]  as they've clearly got closer and closer
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.700]  to being able to ship this Apple TV,
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.180]  the one with the new remote and an app store
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.260]  and not just built on iOS, but using these little
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:53.880]  quote unquote apps that were just XML files
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.340]  to configure what the content was
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.600]  and just put a list on the left and preview on the right
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.500]  and up, down, left, right, and that's it.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:06.500]  But an actual honest to God iOS UI kit app store
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.860]  where you can do games and everything
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.480]  from games to content.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.480]  That there was debate within Apple
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.480]  as to whether they could or should ship this Apple TV
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:26.560]  before they have the TV content package in place.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.180]  And I don't want to say at the executive level
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.700]  that Eddy Cue was on one side
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.260]  and Phil Schiller was on the other,
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.280]  but that effectively somewhere in their divisions
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.900]  where Eddy Cue's team that does the negotiations
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:43.700]  with the TV networks and stuff like that,
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.780]  some of those people were the ones
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.460]  who were pushing for, hey, there's no use shipping this
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:49.700]  until we have this in place.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.060]  And then there was a product side,
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.860]  people who were like, this is really cool.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.420]  We've got a really cool thing here.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.860]  We can ship this and we can add the streaming thing
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.940]  when it's ready.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.760]  Yeah, and I 100% agree with those people,
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.260]  with the product people, because they do.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.440]  And you gotta lay the groundwork for something like that.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.160]  You cannot reinvent television with one product,
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.140]  with one product launch that's essentially
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:17.560]  in its version, what, two or three, 2.0, 3.0,
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.500]  depending on how you look at the first iterations.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.860]  But this had to be a multi-decade project.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:28.660]  And yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.300]  It's so Apple to have released the device itself
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.660]  with the rudimentary version of the App Store
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:40.500]  to just lay the groundwork and mentally prepare
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:45.500]  the consumer base for this so that enough people have them,
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.280]  enough people understand what they are,
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.540]  and then they launch the service and then it's like,
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:56.280]  oh, thank God, one box that has everything that I need.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.960]  Right, I totally agree with that.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.340]  And I really am, let's hold this thought.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.540]  I wanna talk about it, but have you,
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:09.140]  I feel like people are selling the new remote control short.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.780]  Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:12.260]  Let's talk about the remote control next,
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.260]  because this is one of my complaints
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:17.540]  about what one weekend people's take on Apple TV.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.940]  But I wanna tell you about
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.900]  another longtime sponsor of the show.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.940]  Honestly, it could be a great holiday gift,
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:27.580]  although it's the sort of gift
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.820]  that you cannot give somebody
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:30.180]  and not give them something else.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.240]  It's the sort of thing you should do
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.260]  for people in your family in addition to a regular gift.
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.380]  And I'm talking about Backblaze.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:40.060]  Backblaze is online backup for your Mac.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:46.460]  Anyone can backup data, there's all sorts of backup services.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.320]  Backblaze is the one, and again,
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.780]  they're a longtime sponsor of the show,
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.420]  but if they had never sponsored the show,
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.680]  it is still the one that I would use for me personally
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.420]  and the one that I would recommend
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.180]  for everybody in my family.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:00.960]  Here's how it works.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.120]  You install their app on your Mac,
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.900]  and it's written by former ex-Apple engineers.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.500]  This is truly native code.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.380]  It's not some kind of thing that you have to run
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.540]  using Java and install a Java VM.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.280]  It's real Mac code, real Mac user interface.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.840]  You access it right through System Preferences.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.260]  You install it.
[01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:23.620]  There's a free trial period.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.140]  You don't even have to pay right away.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.140]  And what it does is it just backs everything on your Mac
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:31.320]  up to Backblaze's servers, everything.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.340]  And it doesn't matter, it's not just your startup drive.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.860]  If you have external drives connected,
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.220]  it'll back those up too.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.220]  There is no limit, and there is no catch.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.020]  It's not like, well, you say there's no limit,
[01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.620]  but really the limit's one terabyte,
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.200]  and after a terabyte, you gotta pay more.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.100]  Nope.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.980]  The only real catch on size,
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.900]  like let's say if you have eight terabytes of stuff
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.140]  on an external drive,
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.460]  is that it'll take longer for the initial upload.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.300]  That's it.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:54.960]  That's the only catch is that there's no way
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.260]  that they can magically make eight gigabytes
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:01.140]  go from your Mac to their servers in the cloud
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.140]  faster than your internet connection.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.500]  They can't do magic.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.300]  But other than that, it works great.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.220]  And then once you have the full upload,
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:10.980]  it just runs in the background.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:11.980]  You'll never notice it.
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:14.540]  It doesn't make your CPU run real fast
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.380]  or anything like that.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.460]  It just runs quietly, silently in the background
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.960]  and just keeps pushing your stuff up to the cloud.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:22.260]  And then when you need it,
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:28.220]  like let's say disaster strikes and your hard drive crashes,
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.060]  and that's it, that's your only backup.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.100]  It shouldn't be your only backup, but let's say it is.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:34.380]  Well, guess what, you don't have to download everything.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.460]  You could just order a USB hard drive from them.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.980]  They'll sell you the USB hard drive at cost, more or less.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:40.260]  You can get it overnighted.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.460]  And the next day, you've got a USB hard drive
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.260]  delivered to your house that has everything
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:47.180]  from your Backblaze account right there.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:52.100]  But 25% of their restores, 25% are just one file at a time.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.980]  So that's the situation where you're,
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:55.920]  let's say in a meeting and you're away from your computer
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:57.380]  and something comes up and say,
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:00.340]  you've got a file on your Mac, that would be perfect.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.120]  Right now, if you had it, it would be useful right now.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.780]  You can just log on to any computer with a web browser,
[01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:07.100]  log into your Backblaze account,
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:10.460]  and get that one file that you need right there
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.540]  from any computer anywhere in the world.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:16.020]  So 25% of the restores they do are exactly like that.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.620]  They have iPhone and Android apps
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:18.860]  that let you do the same thing,
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.640]  access any of your files anywhere in the world.
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:26.080]  They have backed up over 150 petabytes of total data,
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.380]  and they have restored over 10 billion files
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:30.380]  for their customers.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.660]  It is a great service, it is great software,
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.700]  and it will make you feel so much better
[01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.460]  having it installed on your computer.
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.000]  And if you install it, just when you go home
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.660]  for the holidays, put it on your parents' computer
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.260]  and just sign your parents up for it.
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:46.560]  It's not gonna set you back that much.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.700]  It's five bucks per month per computer for unlimited backup.
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.620]  Five bucks per computer, that's it.
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.500]  So just give it to your parents
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.520]  or somebody else in your family.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.900]  Just sign them up, pay for it.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.100]  And someday they're gonna thank you a lot
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.020]  because eventually every hard drive goes bad.
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.580]  So stop putting it off.
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:12.580]  Go get backed up at backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:18.100]  The free trial, by the way, does not require a credit card.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.120]  I've got one more sponsor coming up.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.380]  We'll talk a little bit about the remote,
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.300]  but I got one more sponsor.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:26.660]  I'm very excited about the next sponsor.
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:27.980]  It's a new sponsor.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.580]  And it's gonna be groundbreaking
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:34.560]  because I have to read a legal disclaimer.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.100]  Oh, you're gonna do it right now?
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:37.940]  No, I'm not.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:40.580]  I just wanted to set the stage and have, you know, I wanna.
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:41.820]  That's awesome.
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.580]  Groundbreaking and a legal disclaimer.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.420]  That's a good tease and I'm excited.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.460]  I have one complaint about the new remote
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.920]  and that is that thousands of people have made it.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.900]  I think it's a mistake that it is symmetric vertically.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:56.740]  Me too.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.560]  Me too. I think it's a mistake.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:00.420]  And I do think that it looks better that way.
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:01.400]  I think it looks great.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:06.060]  And I think that functionally it is a bad idea.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:08.740]  And the bad idea for the obvious reason
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.180]  that people started saying, I think it's a bad idea
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:14.940]  that this is symmetric vertically on September 9th
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.020]  when they first showed it to us
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.900]  and before people had ever even touched it,
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.700]  which is that you won't know which way
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:22.500]  is the right way to hold it in the dark.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.340]  Yeah.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.540]  And not only that, even if you do know
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:28.700]  which way is the right way up, the buttons,
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.500]  the buttons are too similar,
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.020]  like the circular buttons on the left
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.500]  are all identical, you know, to the touch.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:39.340]  Yeah.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.640]  And they didn't even put a little nipple on one of them
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.100]  so you could actually in the dark feel which one is,
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:44.940]  which one is Siri?
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.540]  I don't even know.
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.120]  No, you know, I'm looking at it,
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.260]  it looks like the Siri button
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.620]  might have a little indentation.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.100]  Oh, I can't feel it.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.220]  I can't feel it at all.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.780]  I didn't even know until I looked at it,
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:57.820]  but they're the identically sized circles
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.280]  and I can't tell you the number of times
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.300]  I've already in the last three days
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.460]  hit Siri when I went to hit menu.
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.300]  Right.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.740]  And so there's two problems there actually.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.740]  So one problem is if you're holding it upside down,
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:15.300]  you'll be swiping on a dead area, you know,
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.140]  because it's actually the bottom.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:16.980]  I did that today.
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.300]  And nothing happens.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.540]  And the other problem, and for me,
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.100]  this is actually more common
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:26.140]  because I've gotten careful about putting it down
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:26.980]  facing the right way.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.060]  But right, if you just take a guess
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.620]  and you just feel around button
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.860]  and you don't know if it's menu,
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.580]  you have to like, the only way to be sure
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.100]  is if you feel around first and see,
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:37.340]  oh, I'm at the top of the buttons
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.420]  or I'm at the middle of the buttons.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:39.580]  But with so few buttons,
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.280]  each button should be like a different size
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.340]  or I didn't think about that,
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.540]  but put like a little nipple on
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:46.300]  like they do on the F and JKs on the keyboard.
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.920]  Right, exactly.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:52.320]  Also, there's no, the metaphor
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.540]  of like one side of the, you know,
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:58.060]  the bottom is glossy and the top is matte,
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.020]  that doesn't really apply to any,
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.000]  I don't know, like mental model
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.220]  of which side should be a trackpad
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.480]  and which side is not active.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.300]  Well, and because the iPhone,
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.700]  when you swipe the glossy part.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:11.540]  Yeah.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.080]  Yeah, I didn't think about that, but that's true.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:14.920]  Right.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.780]  That is actually, I didn't even think about that,
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:18.980]  but that's an outstanding point
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.160]  where the glossy feel is what you swipe on an iPhone.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.420]  Yeah.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.260]  The other thing I thought of,
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.680]  and this was a complaint I saw some people
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.280]  defending the symmetry of the remote,
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.520]  which is that tactile difference,
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.720]  that if you feel the shiny, you know,
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.520]  it's upside down, you know, to turn it around.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.360]  My problem with that is that if you just decide
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.560]  to go by touch of the, is it glossy or matte,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.320]  if you have it held the right way
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.440]  and you start rubbing your thumb over the matte part,
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.200]  something happens right away.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.560]  As soon as you touch it, something happens right away.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.180]  Always rub the bottom, always rub the bottom.
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:56.460]  In general, but then if you have it upside down
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.200]  and rub the bottom and you have it backwards,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.440]  something will happen.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.280]  In other words.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.680]  You're screwed, okay.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.520]  You'll immediately start scrubbing forward or backward
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.360]  in the video stream or something like that.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.560]  Now, the fact that something happens
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:11.200]  as soon as you start touching it is actually, to me,
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.640]  part of, and again, I know it's an abused term,
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.680]  but part of what makes it feel magic.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.960]  And so if you know you have it held in your hand
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:22.200]  the right way and you just want to start scrubbing around,
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.080]  fast forward or rewind in the video,
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.680]  it is marvelous that you just touch it and just move.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:31.080]  And it just is instantly, it feels live in a way.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.680]  And it really does remind me of the original iPhone.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.280]  And when you first just started moving up or down
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.160]  in a scrolling list or on a webpage
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:42.740]  and it just moved instantly and just tracked your finger.
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:45.360]  And it just felt like so much more alive
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.080]  than anything I'd ever scrolled before.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.360]  This remote feels alive in a way
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.000]  that like nothing I've ever felt before
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.760]  because you just touch it and it affects what you see live.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.320]  But in terms of deciding whether the remote
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.720]  is in your hand the right way, it's terrible.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.520]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.320]  Still an attractive remote, though.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.520]  Really attractively designed.
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.520]  Think back to the first version of the Apple remote,
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.920]  the white one, the little white chiclet.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.480]  I remember it well, I remember it.
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.160]  It still had the innovation of the wheel,
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.640]  like the circular buttons.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.020]  It was really cleverly designed,
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:30.880]  it just wasn't very attractive.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.000]  But the one thing that that design had,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.340]  my problem with the old remote was mainly the fact
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:37.560]  that it was IR and I hate IR.
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.700]  But if they had done a Bluetooth version of that,
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:42.120]  it wouldn't be as good as this.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.400]  And I've heard some people say they could have just done
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.520]  a D-pad, you know, up, down, left, right,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.920]  and it would have been just as good as this.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:50.300]  And I totally disagree with that, I really do.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.160]  I feel like the momentum you can get from swiping,
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:56.060]  I feel like I'm still getting good at it,
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:59.160]  I'm getting like my C-legs on how fast to go
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.880]  and stuff like that, but I'm already good enough
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.300]  that it's so good and it's so much better
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.820]  than click, click, click, click, click to go over.
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:07.560]  So much better, so much better.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:12.560]  It's not, it just feels like multidimensional.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.180]  It feels like you're in volumetric space,
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:19.320]  even though there's no 3D touch to it yet, but.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.820]  But the one thing about that old design
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.840]  is that you could never, ever, ever forget
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.880]  which way was the right way to hold it, in the dark.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:26.840]  Sure.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.680]  Somebody actually tweeted.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.840]  The buttons were at the top.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.920]  Somebody tweeted me the other day,
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:33.480]  and you didn't have to worry about which button was which,
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:36.820]  because the placement was such that there was never
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.200]  any ambiguity to it.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.480]  There was one circle and then two buttons underneath,
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.760]  and that's it.
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.600]  So you wouldn't even, not just which way is it in your hand,
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.800]  but which button is which, you'd never be confused either.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.640]  Right.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.920]  It was a perfectly capable remote to use blindfolded,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.840]  is one way to put it, which is a good thing to be, I think.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.960]  Somebody tweeted me the other day
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.080]  that I shouldn't be watching TV in the dark.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.200]  That's bad for my eyes.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.040]  What?
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.360]  That's so old-fashioned.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.200]  Yeah, and then I-
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.000]  You're only supposed to watch TV in the dark.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.480]  And I was gonna say that that's crazy.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.680]  How else are you supposed to watch a movie?
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.360]  And then I realized, wait, I can't dispute your,
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.520]  it'll be bad for your eyes anymore.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.160]  Who knows?
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.140]  Maybe that's the problem.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.440]  Maybe the fact that I've spent 30-some years
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.080]  watching TV in as dark a room as I possibly can
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.740]  is exactly what happened to me.
[01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.240]  I don't know.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:35.840]  God, remember when Phillips was making those TVs
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.080]  that would glow-
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.480]  The ambient color behind you?
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.480]  What a dumb, stupid idea.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.160]  I have this one TV that I bought a few years ago.
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.720]  I think LG made it.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.680]  And the remote for it was one of those space remotes
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.880]  that you hold in the air.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.080]  It was like a Wii remote, basically, a Wiimote,
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.680]  where the cursor on screen would do,
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:03.520]  would be wherever you're pointing to it.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.760]  Like you're sort of shining a flashlight
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.160]  on what you wanted.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.280]  And such a dumb idea.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.840]  It was badly calibrated.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.640]  The actual shape of the remote itself
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.760]  didn't have a flat side,
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.360]  so you couldn't set it down on a table.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.840]  Just such a bad, bad idea.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.280]  And we, over the years,
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.320]  I feel like I've tried all the universal remotes
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.920]  from Radio Shack universal remotes
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.920]  to the Logitech Harmony remotes.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.300]  Always because it's always just been such a pain in the ass
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.020]  to switch inputs on eight different things
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:44.420]  to get the audio and video where you need them to be.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.460]  This is quite elegant, though.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:50.980]  I do wish.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:55.300]  I also feel, I feel like in addition to being asymmetric,
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.980]  it's funny that you brought up the nipple.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:00.100]  The other thing I thought is that it seems weird to me
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.720]  that they made the home button
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.720]  not centered at the bottom, like on an iOS device.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.320]  Totally, that would be a perfect place for it, yeah.
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.620]  And I even feel like the icon for it
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.260]  should be a rectangle,
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:19.140]  like the rectangle of the apps, not a TV set.
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:19.980]  And I've even-
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.180]  That's such a weird icon.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:22.820]  Yeah, it just seems weird to me
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:26.260]  because I've heard people on podcasts talking about this
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.860]  and they don't even know what to call that button.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:31.260]  Whereas if it was at the bottom, centered,
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:32.700]  and it doesn't have to be at the bottom of the remote,
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.700]  but just underneath all the other buttons,
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.200]  centered with a rectangular icon,
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.780]  everybody would know exactly what it is.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:42.700]  It's the home button and it takes you home.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.260]  And you double-click it.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.500]  Once you think of it as the home button
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:47.940]  and you know it's the home button,
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:49.900]  it makes all the sense in the world,
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.760]  but it's in such a weird spot and it has a weird icon.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.700]  Right.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.700]  The other thing I would like,
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:58.260]  and I can't help but think it'll come eventually,
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:03.260]  I hope, would be Touch ID and in terms of a long run,
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.540]  I don't know if it would come next year,
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.380]  but within the next one or two years,
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.140]  if they came out with one of these remotes with Touch ID,
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.760]  it would solve an awful lot, I would hope,
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.960]  of these problems that people are complaining about with,
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.660]  well, I have to keep entering passwords for this service,
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.660]  for that service, and stuff like that.
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:25.300]  And get it in Touch ID and, I don't know,
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.500]  there'd be some way to do it.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.340]  And then even then-
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:28.380]  Yeah, let's-
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:31.700]  You could do things like, just one example,
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.700]  everybody, I think, sets up their iTunes
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:37.100]  so that you don't get asked for your password again.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.160]  I mean, that's what I did, right?
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.500]  Your options are like ask every time,
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.980]  ask once an hour, or never ask again
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.940]  for your iTunes password.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.900]  So I have it set up to never ask again.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:49.340]  I totally understand that there are some people,
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:52.460]  depending on how rambunctious your kids are,
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.780]  that maybe you don't wanna leave it set like that
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:58.380]  because your kids will download a lot of stuff.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:01.100]  So having Touch ID in the remote, wouldn't that be great?
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.180]  Then you could have it set so that you just use Touch ID
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:04.260]  every time you wanna buy something.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:07.780]  But then it's only got the adults
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.060]  in the house thumbprints on it.
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:13.740]  Sure, but I'm sure they'll probably enable the remote app,
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:18.180]  which, on a device that has Touch ID,
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:21.980]  available to it before they redesign the remote
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:23.560]  with Touch ID.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:24.400]  The remote app?
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.340]  What about the remote app, the iOS app?
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:29.540]  Oh, I don't know, that might be going away.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.660]  You have insight information.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.300]  No, I don't have insight information,
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:36.900]  other than the fact that that app
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:41.180]  was never really a big part of their strategy or plan
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.900]  for how you would use anything.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:47.800]  It was sort of like the work of one guy within the company
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.980]  who made it and got it.
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:53.220]  It was like, I think we should ship this.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.700]  I think we can do some cool things.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.980]  Yeah, but it was so useful, it was so useful.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.180]  Yeah, but the company was never behind it.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.120]  Here's what I think, and I did think about this
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.720]  in the last week, where for the last couple of years,
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:07.800]  ever since, hey, the rumor that Apple is building
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.700]  a next generation Apple TV has been out,
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.740]  like one of the number one theories
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:14.900]  that people have tossed out on Twitter
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.460]  or written to me in email, readers of the site,
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:20.420]  is the theory that it won't even come with a remote
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:23.900]  and you'll use your iPhone as the remote.
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.900]  And I've always shut that down,
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:30.900]  because you cannot sell a $100 or even $150 box
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.860]  that requires a $700 remote control.
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:38.620]  And you cannot, it doesn't matter
[01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:41.140]  how careful your kids are, you can't have little kids
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:45.900]  using, even the iPod touch is like the cheapest thing
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.140]  you can get, like a $200 thing with a glass screen
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.600]  as the remote control, it just does not fly.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:56.020]  But I think it's so funny that not only were they wrong
[01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:59.120]  that the Apple, that an iPhone or an iPod touch
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.160]  would be the default remote for the Apple TV,
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:05.300]  but that they've gone so far as to actually not let you
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.460]  use it as one with the remote app.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:10.740]  Like, it was like the worst, it could not have been
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:12.040]  a more wrong prediction.
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.260]  Yeah, but it doesn't, it's not one that makes sense
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:19.340]  in any way, like why not enable software
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:21.180]  from another one of their devices
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:24.820]  that extends the capabilities of this device?
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:28.420]  It's such an easy, not easy technically,
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.740]  it's probably really difficult,
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.460]  but easy conceptually thing to do.
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:33.920]  I don't know, and the one area where I feel like
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.460]  it really would be useful, especially,
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:37.940]  and everybody's complaining this week
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.460]  because of the first run, where, you know,
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.780]  and it ends up, I didn't know this,
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:44.140]  but I learned that if you sign up for Netflix
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.900]  through iTunes, that you don't have to enter
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:49.500]  your password again, that it comes,
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:52.480]  it is somehow included in your iTunes account.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.940]  But I don't know, I think like most people,
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.600]  I signed up for Netflix long enough ago
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.780]  that I pay Netflix directly, and so yes,
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:02.360]  I had to enter our Netflix password.
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.140]  But for entering passwords, or anything you actually
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:08.100]  have to type, being able to do it on the phone
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:11.920]  was such an incredible convenience.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.260]  And it is odd, I know, and some people complain
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.460]  that Guy and I kind of blew it off last week,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.760]  but it is kind of curious that the old Apple TV
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.540]  would let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard,
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.820]  and it still lets you pair Bluetooth things.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.140]  You can pair any Bluetooth, like universal remote control,
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.400]  and you can pair universal, or not universal,
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:32.660]  you know, Bluetooth game controllers.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:36.780]  And it's therefore very conspicuous that they won't
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:40.120]  let you pair a Bluetooth keyboard with it,
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.380]  which might only be useful, or at least would be
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:45.280]  the most useful in like the first day or two
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.700]  that you have the thing, and you're setting up
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.140]  these accounts and entering your, you know,
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.260]  Comcast email and stuff like that.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.060]  You know what I would have liked to have the option to do,
[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:59.380]  even though this would definitely be a power move,
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:02.260]  or a power user move, is just use Siri
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:05.020]  to say my password out loud.
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:08.100]  It sounds so stupid when I put it that way,
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:12.140]  and because all my passwords are like 10 character hashes
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.660]  from one password anyway, but I would easily prefer
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.660]  saying capital A nine, you know, seven hash, you know.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:24.020]  Yeah, and I could see how that would work
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:26.660]  if Siri was expecting you to spell it.
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:29.420]  Like if they said, it was like an option on screen
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:32.220]  that said spell your password to Siri.
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.740]  And so if Siri knew that it was listening for you
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.940]  to say letters and numbers, and like the word capital
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.940]  and uppercase, it would, I think that Siri
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.680]  would definitely be able to do that.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.460]  So you don't think it was a scheduling thing,
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:51.580]  a development schedule thing that they left out
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:52.500]  their note out? I think some of it might be.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:56.180]  I think that the Bluetooth keyboard, I hold out hope,
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.700]  still might be a scheduling thing.
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:02.000]  But Jason Snell on the Upgrade podcast,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.420]  I just linked to it today, I thought it was
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.860]  a great episode with him and Mike Early,
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:08.480]  but Jason pointed out, I didn't know this,
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.740]  but at the September 9th event,
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.180]  where they announced all this,
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:17.180]  he astutely asked the question at the hands-on area,
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.780]  hey, does this new one work with the remote app?
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.900]  And he was sort of expecting either the answer,
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:28.660]  yep, it'll work by the time it comes out,
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:32.180]  or he was expecting if it doesn't, or they didn't yet,
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.300]  or they didn't wanna say, or the person didn't even know
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.340]  that they would just give the typical Apple answer,
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:40.020]  which is, you know, we're not talking about that,
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.140]  or we don't know.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:44.180]  Instead, the answer was no.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:47.180]  And he was like, no, it's not going to work,
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.860]  and they were like, no, that's not going to work.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:52.820]  And that was a very, and he even said that was not,
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.180]  I didn't expect that to be possible,
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.500]  because I thought even if that was the answer,
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.660]  they wouldn't say it, but instead,
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:58.620]  they were already willing to tell people
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:59.720]  on September 9th, it won't work.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.140]  I don't get it, I don't quite get why not.
[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:06.100]  Well, what was the functionality that the remote app did?
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.340]  Like, did you use the remote app?
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:09.540]  Only for typing the old Apple.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.500]  I never used it to go up, down, left, right,
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:15.180]  because I found, because it, the actual interface,
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:18.020]  to me, the mismatch between swiping
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:21.640]  and an interface that only had,
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:25.660]  didn't have any kind of analog,
[01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.900]  it wasn't like you could swipe fast to go far,
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.220]  like swiping to the right would just go over one
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:33.160]  to the right, whether you swiped a little to the right,
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.580]  or a lot to the right, or slow to the right,
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.940]  or fast to the right, it just went over one.
[01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.420]  And that never felt right to me.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:41.260]  And I, every once in a while.
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:44.340]  It makes so much more sense on this one, though,
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:48.500]  because that's actually the interface.
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:52.220]  I guess, right, and couldn't they just put up a fakey-fake,
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:56.540]  I would envision that a modern version of the remote app
[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:58.980]  would look a lot like the remote, where,
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:01.540]  let's say, the top, but instead of being 50-50,
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.940]  I would just say, like, the top two-thirds,
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:07.180]  or top, maybe almost all of it, would be a swiping zone,
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:10.660]  and then at the bottom, there'd be buttons for Siri,
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:14.380]  and play-pause, and plus-minus for volume.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:18.260]  Yeah, I would use the remote app for navigation
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:20.500]  when the real remote app,
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.340]  or when the real remote would disappear.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:23.180]  Yeah, that's the times I had to use it.
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:24.900]  It's tiny, and it constantly does.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:26.980]  Right, because I often stay up later
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.260]  than the rest of the family,
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:31.260]  and that's when I watch TV, or I watch movies
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.100]  that nobody else wants to watch.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:34.700]  Sure, ooh, what I noticed, speaking of,
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.940]  sorry, sorry, go ahead, I have something.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:38.300]  But there are times where I,
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:40.300]  there are times where I will spend 10 minutes
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:42.500]  looking for the Apple TV remote,
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:45.060]  and then I say, screw it, because, you know,
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:47.180]  to hell with it, I'll just use the remote app.
[01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:49.740]  And it was always a nice fallback to have.
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:52.340]  Yeah, and the watch app was pretty fun to use, too.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:54.060]  Tiny little track pad.
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.460]  Yeah, well, just let me say this.
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.060]  I think I said, did we say this last week?
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.180]  That it does seem damn curious
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:02.620]  that even Tim Cook himself has been,
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:05.620]  you know, four months ago was talking about how he,
[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.660]  one of the favorite things he does with his Apple Watch
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:11.260]  is control his Apple TV, and now that doesn't work.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:13.220]  And it makes me, I just assumed that Tim Cook
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.980]  was using the new Apple TV, you know,
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:16.180]  for like a year or something like that,
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.420]  but I guess not.
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:22.100]  I bet they have something coming that's just different,
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.860]  you know, different from the remote app.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:26.140]  They've gotta be doing it, they've gotta be.
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:28.540]  What I was gonna say, though, is that I also,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:32.220]  like you, I stay up late and will watch TV
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.180]  when the rest of the family's asleep.
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:38.180]  And so I have headphones for my TV,
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.420]  and I had the headphones when I first set up
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:44.500]  the new Apple TV, and I realized how stereophonically,
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:49.660]  like spatially cool the sound design is in the UI.
[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:52.180]  Like, you know, the navigation really,
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:54.500]  really heavily favors left or right,
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.100]  depending on where you are on the screen, it's very cool.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.340]  I don't know if anybody's picking up on that,
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:01.940]  because most people don't watch TV through headphones.
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:05.660]  Dan, you make me want to try it.
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:06.620]  That sounds awesome.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:09.020]  I think the sound design of this thing is amazing.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.760]  I know some of the sounds are very similar
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:13.380]  to the old Apple TV, but there's subtle ways
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.220]  that they feel more alive.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.580]  Well, they're less percussive.
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:20.900]  Like, just the, you know, the old Apple TV
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.340]  was full of like bings and bongs with hard sounds
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:25.340]  at the top, you know, at the top of the sound.
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.820]  Like, just those like, you know, pong,
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.420]  like kind of the TiVo kind of sounds.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.460]  But the new one is very, very like soft sounds,
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:35.540]  like round, soft, like just melodic sounds
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.220]  that are just really pleasing.
[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:39.740]  Hmm, yeah, that sounds exactly right to me.
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:41.200]  And it's a funny little,
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:45.460]  it's a funny little contrast with the visuals,
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:49.060]  which are that the icons and the posters
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.900]  are sharp cornered rectangles,
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.020]  as opposed to the round rectangles and round squares
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.540]  that we've had on all these other iOS things for a while.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:58.660]  That's a great point.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:02.900]  Yeah, there's just, they'll put sharp elements
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.940]  in places and soft elements in other places.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:07.300]  And I would say, just the way that the,
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.660]  like we were talking about before,
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:12.380]  the way that the icons pivot and sort of roll around
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:15.860]  is very soft, that's a very soft animated element.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.380]  Yeah, because I think the,
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.180]  I think to me the aesthetically how they get away
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.760]  with making these sharp cornered rectangles
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:25.820]  for the app icons and for the movie
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.460]  and show posters, poster images,
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.260]  the way they make that work and have it feel lightweight
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:35.260]  is because it feels like they are paper thin.
[01:54:35.260 --> 01:54:36.300]  Yeah.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:39.940]  And the fact that they pivot, like you said,
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:43.220]  like they're on a ball joint, which is exactly right,
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:48.220]  is, it just increases the sense that it's not just paper,
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.860]  but like really thin, lightweight paper.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:55.360]  Yeah, I love that idea of weight in UI elements
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.780]  and that this somehow strikes a balance
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:01.340]  between like feeling like it has weight,
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:05.200]  but feeling, and rigidity, but still that it's like,
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.000]  it's got the lightness of digital elements.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.380]  Yeah, and there is, there is like,
[01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:14.720]  and to me it speaks to the, what makes me excited
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.520]  about what apps people are gonna come up with
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.740]  and the games that people might come up with
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:22.800]  that maybe are games that aren't quite,
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.800]  wouldn't quite make as much sense on the iPhone
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.000]  or something like that, it'll make perfect sense here,
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  is that there's clearly just in the built-in interface
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:36.380]  a sense of feel, the connection between your thumb
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:39.500]  on the remote track pad and what you see on screen
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.380]  and the way that, you know, if you just move your thumb
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:47.380]  so subtly, it is reflected instantly in what you see
[01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:50.340]  in a very tangible way.
[01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:55.420]  I know it's weird, because it's not direct touch
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:57.120]  and it's, you know, that would be the stupidest thing
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.660]  in the world to have a TV that is actually a touchscreen.
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.300]  I mean, other than certain weird context,
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.300]  like in a museum or something like that, I mean, or, you know.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:10.300]  But to me, one of the things that this has that,
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:13.240]  to me, I've never seen on any other device
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:16.260]  is that it feels like I'm touching my TV.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.100]  Yeah, well, you know, you remember that,
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.700]  like, that's how the world was introduced to multi-touch.
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:25.060]  Before the iPhone, there was a,
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:26.920]  everybody got fascinated by that.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:27.760]  Jeff Hahn.
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:29.580]  The guy's Jeff Hahn, yeah, the Jeff Hahn display
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.140]  that then CNN started using and everything like that.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:34.380]  That's what we think of,
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:35.780]  or that's what we used to think of
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:36.900]  when we thought about touching a screen.
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:39.540]  And, you know, Microsoft Surface,
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:40.660]  the original Microsoft Surface was tabletop.
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.600]  Sure, yeah, the tabletop, yeah.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:48.080]  So I downloaded Lumino City,
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.580]  because the trailer is beautiful,
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.220]  but I could not figure out how to play it,
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.900]  because I'm not a game guy, and I feel like,
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:57.700]  I felt like such an idiot trying to figure out what to do.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.820]  I didn't hear that last, Lumino City?
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.740]  Lumino City, it's like one of the featured apps.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.820]  It's just, like, gorgeous, it's about a little girl.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:06.420]  It's almost got that Monument Valley
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.860]  kind of papercraft feel to it.
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:11.020]  It's really beautiful.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.380]  So, you know, I just put that up,
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.860]  and I downloaded Nevin's Game Space Age,
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.360]  which, of course, is super fun.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:19.860]  But I'm not gonna use this as a game device.
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:20.860]  I'm absolutely not.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.220]  I don't use my iPhone as a game device.
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.000]  I'm gonna use this to get, hopefully,
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.460]  all of the content that I ever need to watch
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:29.640]  or want to watch.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.220]  I don't know that I will have spent a lot of time
[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.260]  in the long run playing it as a game device.
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:38.180]  But, like, you know, Jonas, who's obsessed with video games
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:40.740]  to the point where it's, you know, maybe a problem.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.620]  And hey, we have a PS4.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:47.540]  So to me, it's been an interesting litmus test.
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:52.580]  And he's still interested in it as a gaming device.
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:54.420]  I mean, and, you know, and he knows what it is.
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:59.420]  But even somebody who, like him, who likes playing serious,
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:01.180]  you know, what do you call them, triple-A title,
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.660]  you know, you know, 50, $60 games.
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.420]  Like, you know, what's the one he's playing now?
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:06.260]  Destiny.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:09.420]  You know, Destiny is a thing for the PS4.
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:12.220]  But he's getting enjoyment out of some
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:13.940]  of these casual games, you know.
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:16.420]  Like, you know, maybe there's only 10 minutes
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.080]  before we expect to be eating dinner.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.660]  And he's got 10 minutes.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.620]  He's enjoying playing some of these Apple TV games.
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.600]  I played a game last night,
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.680]  and it's the longest I've played a video game,
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.020]  I think, in over a year.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.880]  Or at least, I can't even remember the last time
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:31.780]  I played a video game for an hour.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:36.260]  It's this game called Paco, P-A-K-O.
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.940]  And the first level, I actually did play
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.060]  a couple other levels then.
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.900]  I didn't enjoy any of them nearly as much
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:46.300]  as the first level.
[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.540]  I think I paid $3 for it, or $4.
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.860]  I got way more than $4 of enjoyment from it.
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:51.920]  I may not play it in the long run.
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:54.020]  But have you ever heard of this game, P-A-K-O?
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:54.860]  No.
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:56.160]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:58.280]  So the gist of it is you're in, like,
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:01.780]  a little isomorphic 3D parking lot.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:03.700]  You're in a mall parking lot.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.900]  I, like, go on.
[01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.740]  And you're, they don't tell you who you are,
[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:10.980]  but I imagine that you're a teenager
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:12.580]  driving, like, your parents' car,
[01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:14.020]  and you're just raising hell.
[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:16.020]  It's like a little, like, black hatchback,
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:19.560]  like a VW Rabbit-type looking thing.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:20.620]  And you're in a parking lot,
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.540]  and there is no way out of the parking lot.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:24.940]  And the cops are coming because there's been a report
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:28.100]  of somebody driving, like, a nut in the parking lot.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:30.620]  And your car, it's as though the,
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:33.780]  there is no brake, and the accelerator is down to the pedal,
[01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:35.060]  and there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:37.500]  And all you can do is turn left or right.
[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:38.340]  That's so fun.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.220]  And all you do is drive around a parking lot
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:43.100]  for as long as you can until,
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:46.300]  and the police are trying to smash into your car.
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.900]  And so if you smash into anything, you're done.
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:51.560]  If the police smash into you, you're done.
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.400]  And that's it.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:53.620]  And there's no way to get extra lives.
[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:54.460]  That's it.
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:57.540]  You just drive around the parking lot, raising hell,
[01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:59.860]  this is, for as long as you can.
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:02.740]  And it's hard, and it's a hard game.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:03.800]  It's like-
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.820]  That definitely came to somebody in a dream.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.540]  Like, that's a total anxiety dream.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.660]  And I might've even spoiled it a little bit here
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:15.700]  by telling you that you can't get out of the parking lot,
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.580]  because I actually didn't know.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.380]  I just saw this on the Apple TV,
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:21.460]  and I'm in this mood of trying to figure out
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.860]  what's possible and what's available.
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:25.660]  And this Paco game looked cool, so I got it.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:27.900]  And I started playing, and it doesn't really
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.180]  tell you what to do.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:33.500]  And it just says, it's almost like a TV news flash,
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:34.820]  like the thing at the bottom of CNN,
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:38.740]  it just says, reports of trouble at the mall parking lot.
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:40.220]  And then it just says, go.
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:42.180]  And then your car just goes,
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:44.180]  and there's no way to make it slow down or stop,
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:46.620]  and you just go left or right.
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.500]  And I spent the first 15 minutes
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:50.460]  trying to find my way out of this parking lot
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.540]  until I figured out that there is no way out of the parking lot.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.500]  Oh God, it's a nightmare.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.540]  Right, and there's like no way to win.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:00.180]  You can't, it's not like if, as far as I know,
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:01.500]  I don't know, maybe there is a way to win.
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.940]  I don't know, I had one where I got it over two minutes,
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:06.660]  and that was my longest run by a long shot.
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.820]  And it just, you don't get anything for it.
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:15.820]  What other non-game apps have you tried out,
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:18.220]  downloaded, used, what are your favorites?
[02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:20.000]  Let me think about non-game apps.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.660]  Mostly just video content.
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.060]  It's mostly a lot of the same stuff
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.300]  that I had on the old Apple TV,
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.460]  but I find it a lot easier.
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:31.140]  I know one of the big common complaints is,
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.960]  over and over, people, I see in these reviews,
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.780]  people saying they want the voice search
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:37.540]  to work in more places.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:42.140]  And I just, to me, that is an absolute, this is a 1.0,
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.380]  and it's coming, I think, and it's just a basis.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:50.460]  Yeah, I mean, Siri is still pretty limited in iOS in general
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.300]  compared to what it can and should eventually do.
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:57.020]  Yeah, what other apps have you seen that caught your eye?
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:59.140]  I like Air Video.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.820]  Do you know the Air Video app?
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.060]  No, I'm writing it down.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:04.940]  It's this really cool app where if you have media
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.960]  on a server at home.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.180]  Oh, I've heard of this.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:13.460]  Yeah, it's just basically a great, seamless,
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:16.580]  and really, really fluid way of getting,
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:20.420]  of streaming media to your device.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.180]  And so I have a Mac Mini in the closet
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:25.180]  where the cable modem and everything is hooked up,
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:28.860]  where my airport router and everything is,
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:30.900]  and it's got movies and stuff
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.860]  that I don't wanna keep on a laptop.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:38.300]  And so you can browse to that,
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.900]  if you keep it in your iTunes library
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.060]  where your media server is,
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:45.260]  you can watch it through iTunes,
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:47.260]  but that's always been a pretty terrible experience.
[02:02:47.260 --> 02:02:49.800]  So Air Video makes it a not terrible experience.
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:51.940]  That's very cool.
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.980]  And it's also, they had pioneered,
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:56.260]  you know that really, really cool scrolling thing
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:57.420]  that the new Apple TV does
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:00.640]  where you get just a really good, real-time picture
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:04.340]  of where in the timeline you are?
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.180]  Yes.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:08.700]  You and Guy talked about it on the last episode.
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:12.300]  Air Video had that already in their iOS app,
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:14.900]  and it's just really, really, really good.
[02:03:16.260 --> 02:03:17.380]  It's just well-engineered.
[02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:20.160]  It's one of those apps that third-party developers have made
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:23.700]  that just feels like the engineers are just so smart
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:25.300]  they should probably be acquired.
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:29.620]  I think it does figure some shit out for Apple.
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:31.580]  It's just one of my frustrations
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:34.420]  with what people are saying about Apple TV,
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:39.420]  and I forget if it was you or somebody else on Twitter
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:43.060]  was saying that it's like 90% of what's there is awesome,
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:45.740]  and 10% is there's serious problems
[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:46.620]  that we can complain about,
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:48.160]  and all everybody is talking about
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.420]  is the 10% that's problematic.
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.600]  Yeah, and then not only that,
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.260]  but the 10% that represents your first hour with the device,
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:56.900]  and then not anymore.
[02:03:56.900 --> 02:04:01.900]  Right, I feel like I want to pay extra money
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.020]  and have Apple give it to the team
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:07.360]  that made fast-forward and reverse work like this,
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.500]  and it's the best fast-forward and reverse
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:10.940]  I've ever seen on any device,
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:12.020]  and after a week with it,
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.060]  I'm willing to say it's better than TiVo's.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.900]  It is the best that I've seen.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.700]  It is so good.
[02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:20.380]  It is exact, and again,
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.500]  I'm sure all computers will work like this someday,
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:23.660]  but up until this point,
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:27.540]  fast-forwarding and reversing and scanning in video,
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:30.580]  especially streams, it's been absolutely horrible.
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:32.220]  It's a crapshoot, and this,
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:34.700]  it's like you can go exactly to where you want,
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.500]  and it's instantaneous, and it's amazing.
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:40.780]  And even the thumbnails, to me, are higher resolution
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:43.920]  and bigger than any thumbnails I've ever seen before.
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.920]  Yeah, they're great.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:49.920]  And I love that, by default,
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.100]  they didn't load a bunch of crap
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:54.820]  in the home screen for me.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:59.460]  Because even the version three of the Apple TV,
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.720]  you buy a new one, you take it home,
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.920]  and it's got all the Disney XD and all the Disney crap,
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.300]  and then it's got Crunchyroll.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:08.580]  What the hell is Crunchyroll?
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:09.440]  I don't need Crunchyroll.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:10.740]  I don't need Korea TV.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:14.140]  You sure as shit don't need Crunchyroll by default.
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:17.220]  Yeah, it's got all this crap that you end up resenting.
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:20.940]  It just feels like cruft, like an old Windows box
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:23.180]  or something, and they didn't do any of that.
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:25.620]  Like Fox News Financial UK.
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.940]  Yeah, exactly, why is that on there?
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.340]  I don't need that.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.540]  But that would have undermined the whole point
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:34.560]  of the Apple TV app store if they had loaded anything
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:38.420]  besides just the very basic three,
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.180]  there was movies, TV, and settings, and I forget,
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:46.260]  what else, they didn't even have YouTube preloaded on there.
[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:48.540]  You have to do the work, go and find it,
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.460]  and then your mind is blown by what else is available.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:54.420]  Yeah, and I thought there was a cool section of,
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:57.060]  and I know that they didn't have top charts right away,
[02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:58.620]  and people complained about it,
[02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:00.060]  and they've already got them.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:00.900]  They already have them.
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:02.340]  I really think it was the fact
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.860]  that because nobody had used the thing outside Apple,
[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:08.960]  they couldn't have top charts because nobody was there.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.480]  But they had a cool thing that really helped me at first,
[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:13.660]  I thought, and again, overall, yes,
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:16.100]  the first run experience could use some help
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:17.740]  so that you don't have to enter so many passwords
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:18.700]  over and over again.
[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:21.700]  And some people are hitting weird snags
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:23.740]  where they've gotta jump through hoops
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:26.900]  to get their iTunes account so they can buy stuff.
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.620]  You have to go to another device
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:34.460]  and go to your Apple ID page and a web browser
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:36.500]  and verify your address or something like that.
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:37.340]  Didn't happen to me.
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:38.820]  It doesn't seem to have happened to most people.
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:40.600]  It did happen to Jason Snell.
[02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:42.260]  That's a huge pain in the ass,
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:43.860]  and whatever the problem is causing that,
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.700]  they oughta look into it,
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:49.300]  because Christmas morning, that's not a fun thing.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:50.300]  Yeah.
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.340]  What I would love to be able to change
[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:57.340]  is that movies is top left of my home screen,
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:06:59.980]  and they will show you your purchased movies
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:03.140]  in the top header first,
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:06.640]  and then the top movies on the store after that.
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:09.900]  And I have purchased three things apparently.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:12.140]  One is Frozen, which I've never watched,
[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:15.620]  but Roxanna's niece and nephew were over,
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:17.680]  and they wanted to watch Frozen, so I bought it.
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.260]  The second one is Real Genius, which is my favorite movie,
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.620]  and then the third one is Disney Paperman,
[02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:25.000]  which I watched once and is really nice,
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.660]  but I don't need to see those.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:29.140]  Those now represent my home screen and my experience,
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:30.940]  my every experience with Apple.
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:33.020]  You've only bought three movies from iTunes?
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:34.980]  No, that can't be true.
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:35.820]  If I go to,
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:39.420]  that absolutely can't be true,
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:41.420]  but that's what it looks like?
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.260]  That's what it looks like
[02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:44.100]  because they only show you the three.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:45.460]  Let's see, all movies.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.520]  No, I have eight on here.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.460]  You don't buy movies from iTunes?
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:50.680]  No, I rent them.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:52.140]  Okay.
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:54.900]  Yeah, the first movie I ever bought with iTunes
[02:07:54.900 --> 02:07:56.660]  right when the iTunes movie store launched
[02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:00.080]  was Oh, Brother of Our Art Thou, and that's still on here.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.540]  I have one called The Happiest Baby on the Block,
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:06.340]  which was teaching us how to shush our baby to sleep,
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:10.980]  and then Cloud Atlas, which is my favorite movie, also.
[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:16.180]  Do you buy a lot of movies?
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.380]  I buy tons of movies.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.180]  I've got like 300 iTunes movies.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:21.460]  Well, why would you do that, though?
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:22.540]  Because you can rent it anytime.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:23.380]  You know what?
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.620]  Because I kept running into the problem
[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:27.300]  where I'd rent the movie.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:30.460]  If they gave us 36 hours instead of 24 hours,
[02:08:30.460 --> 02:08:33.700]  I would probably only own 100 movies instead of 300,
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.100]  but it got to the point where I had so many times
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:38.900]  where I'd rented a movie, and then I was like,
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:40.740]  I gotta go to bed, and I'd go to bed,
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:44.060]  and then the next night, it was already expired,
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.700]  and then I'd have to rent it again, and I felt so mad,
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.900]  and even though the cost of two rentals
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:52.060]  is less than, still less than the cost of buying it,
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.660]  it's close enough that I just started buying them,
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:57.780]  and now I just buy whatever I wanna watch from iTunes.
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:59.460]  I get it, and the hack around that
[02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:02.020]  was that you could pause it and just like
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:05.020]  leave your Apple TV on, and then just like,
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:06.540]  you wouldn't be able to do anything else
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:07.620]  until you unpaused it.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:09.180]  That stopped working for me, though,
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:10.500]  and I know it was still supposed to.
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:11.940]  Yeah, it was like I would just enter
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.340]  like an endless spinner where it would be like authorizing,
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.860]  and the authorization would never stop.
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:16.700]  Oh, that sucks.
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:17.580]  Then you give up and hit Menu,
[02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:19.180]  and they're like, this expired.
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.700]  So that's why, if rentals had a bigger window,
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:28.340]  like 48 hours or even, I've always said 36 would do it,
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:30.660]  because 36 would let you watch the next night
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.980]  no matter when you start.
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:34.620]  I'd have bought a lot fewer.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:37.540]  Do you happen to know what kind of a profit center
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.460]  is the movie rental store for Apple?
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:41.380]  I don't know exactly,
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:43.140]  because they just lump it all together,
[02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:45.620]  but it is grown, though, it is big.
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.660]  Like Horace DeGioia's tracked how much,
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:50.300]  it's just all lumped in together with the app store
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:52.460]  and stuff like, and the music store and stuff like that,
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.160]  but it is significant.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.340]  Anything that they do is insignificant compared to,
[02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:00.940]  and this is great, because I don't wanna,
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:02.380]  I'm not a financial guy.
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.000]  You know, like Apple did the finances last week,
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.500]  and Guy and I didn't talk about them,
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:07.300]  and you and I are gonna talk about them.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:08.900]  But long story short,
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:10.340]  the one thing that I think gets overlooked
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:12.860]  is everybody emphasizes that they're so lopsided
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:15.980]  in favor of the revenue from the iPhone,
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.740]  because the iPhone is so humongous.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:22.160]  But the thing is is that everything else at Apple combined,
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.820]  other than iPhone, has revenues
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.740]  that's more than the combined revenues
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:28.840]  of Facebook and Microsoft.
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:33.140]  So Apple's non-iPhone business is huge.
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:36.860]  And it just, all of it, any single part of that, though,
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:38.740]  pales in comparison to the iPhone,
[02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:42.020]  because the iPhone is like unfathomably big,
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:43.500]  revenue and profit-wise.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:46.300]  And I think that the iTunes stuff is definitely significant.
[02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:48.060]  I don't think, you know, nobody really talks
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:52.580]  about that being run as a loss leader or breakeven anymore.
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:55.220]  I think it's pretty clear that they make money on that.
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:57.500]  Yeah, I really hope that they can start breaking them out
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:00.980]  when they do do a cable-like package,
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.180]  because that is an entirely separate business.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:07.740]  I think if you're usurping a multi, multi-billion dollar
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:09.420]  telecommunications industry,
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:12.500]  you should probably have to report the earnings from that.
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.660]  I think so too, but the truth is,
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:17.260]  even though Apple hides a lot of this stuff,
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:18.920]  or not hides it, but groups it all together
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.040]  so you can't break it down,
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:21.440]  they're still a lot more transparent
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.820]  than some of their competitors, like Amazon.
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:27.220]  Amazon is just like, ah, we made money.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:28.260]  Here's how much money.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:31.300]  Screw Amazon for not having an app too, I hate that.
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:32.580]  Let's hold a thought on that,
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:34.300]  and let's come back to that.
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:37.660]  I gotta do this last sponsor.
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:39.980]  I'm very excited about this, I told you before.
[02:11:39.980 --> 02:11:42.180]  Brand new sponsor, haven't sponsored us before,
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.660]  it's a company called Wealthfront.
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:50.160]  Now Wealthfront, it's a way to make it easy
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:52.280]  for anyone to access world-class,
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.100]  long-term investment management.
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:57.740]  It's an online automatic service
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:00.700]  that invests your money for you.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:02.380]  Here's what you do, you sign up for an account
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:05.580]  at wealthfront.com, takes just a few minutes,
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:09.060]  and you put some money in there,
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:11.000]  and then they invest the money for you.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.500]  Their software optimizes your investments
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:18.040]  for the best risk-adjusted return net of taxes and fees.
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.540]  So in addition to charging one of the lowest fees
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.820]  in the industry, and charging nothing at all
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:26.800]  for commissions, it's always working to save you money,
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.460]  to earn money on your investment,
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:31.740]  and to save you money on your taxes.
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:33.820]  It is transparent and accessible,
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:36.440]  you can view all of your accounts in one place,
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:39.000]  whether they are personal accounts, joint accounts,
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.380]  retirement accounts, and you can see every trade
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:44.660]  that Wealthfront makes on your behalf
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:46.420]  in your dashboard anywhere you go.
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.940]  They've got all sorts of complicated,
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.220]  they explain it, they go into detail about this,
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:54.260]  I'm no investment, I just said that before,
[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:55.480]  almost by coincidence.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.300]  But here's the deal, most of these places,
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:01.820]  most places, traditional places where you invest money,
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:04.700]  take at least 1% of whatever you invest with them
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:08.640]  as their fee, a lot of them take up to 3%.
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:10.300]  So with Wealthfront, here's what they take,
[02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:14.160]  it's just a flat 1 quarter of 1%,
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:16.300]  that they call that 25 basis points,
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:18.620]  I didn't know what a basis point is before.
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:23.620]  1 quarter of 1%, and it does not kick in
[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.100]  until you have over $10,000 in there.
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:28.980]  So you can do up to $10,000 in your Wealthfront account,
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:31.020]  and they won't take anything, they don't take any fees,
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:34.300]  they only take 1 quarter of 1%
[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:37.540]  on what's in there over $10,000.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:40.500]  Even better than that though, for talk show listeners,
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:45.300]  they have a promotion where if you go to wealthfront.com
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:49.620]  slash the talk show, and you sign up there,
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:51.100]  you can even see it when you go to that page,
[02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:52.440]  they have a special splash page,
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.780]  go check it out for talk show listeners,
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:56.800]  they up that to $15,000.
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:59.340]  So the first $15,000 you put in your account,
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:01.020]  no fees at all, you don't pay anything,
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:02.980]  no fees, no commissions for life,
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:05.460]  and then you only pay 1 quarter of 1% after that.
[02:14:08.140 --> 02:14:10.580]  More or less they have a strategy
[02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:13.300]  where they put all your money in index funds,
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:16.580]  and they move it around and try to be smart about it.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:21.140]  So it's not like they're putting it into risky stuff.
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.880]  It's about as stable as it can be.
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:27.300]  Sort of a conservative long-term growth strategy
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:28.140]  for your investment.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:29.380]  I don't know shit about investments,
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.820]  so this to me is very, very intriguing.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.340]  So go check them out, wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:38.540]  More or less they just wanna manage your money for you.
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:39.780]  Sounds intriguing to me,
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:42.580]  I'm absolutely gonna check them out.
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:44.500]  And this is it, this is the best part.
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:46.940]  This is a required disclosure I have to read to you.
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:49.280]  For compliance purposes, I have to tell you
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:50.700]  that Wealthfront Incorporated
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:53.400]  is an SEC registered investment advisor.
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:55.580]  Brokerage services are offered
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:57.540]  through Wealthfront Brokerage Corporation,
[02:14:57.540 --> 02:15:02.220]  member F-I-N-R-A and S-I-P-C.
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:05.660]  This is not a solicitation to buy or sell securities.
[02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:07.620]  Investing in securities involves risks,
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:10.180]  and there is the possibility of losing money.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:12.380]  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:17.200]  Please visit wealthfront.com to read our full disclosure.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.900]  Apparently, if I didn't read that,
[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:22.260]  I would be going to prison.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:24.100]  Yeah, big old SEC violation.
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:26.300]  Yep, I would go right to jail.
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:29.260]  Oh, seriously, that's pretty much what they told me.
[02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:31.620]  Yeah, there's all kinds of restrictions.
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:35.620]  One of their competitors in the robo-advising industry
[02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:37.060]  is a client of mine,
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:40.460]  and that FINRA SEC stuff is no joke, man.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.640]  Yeah.
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:43.780]  Maybe it'd be funny if me and you went to prison together.
[02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:44.620]  I wouldn't mind it.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:46.300]  I wouldn't mind it anywhere near as badly
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.060]  if you and I could go together.
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:50.560]  Yeah, we would wear matching eye patches.
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:51.400]  Yeah.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:55.780]  I feel like that's what you need to get through.
[02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.340]  Let's talk about Apple computers all day.
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:59.300]  Yeah, just to get through a stint in a white collar prison,
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:00.660]  you just need one buddy.
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:01.880]  Yeah.
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.580]  Oh, God, I'd need a buddy, yeah.
[02:16:05.020 --> 02:16:06.280]  Can't even imagine.
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:07.860]  What were we talking about before?
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:10.020]  What was our last name?
[02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:10.860]  Amazon.
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.220]  Amazon, those bastards.
[02:16:13.220 --> 02:16:15.600]  Spiteful, spiteful bastards.
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.980]  I feel like they've taken it up a level
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:20.100]  by not doing it at Apple.
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:22.300]  And it's funny because...
[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.000]  So I've got the Amazon Prime.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:27.200]  Yeah, it's really...
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:28.120]  It just feels spiteful.
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:30.980]  And I knew it, and it made sense to me before I had it.
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:33.740]  The Fire, you have their box?
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:34.860]  No, I don't have their box,
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:36.480]  and I don't want another box.
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.400]  And they didn't have a thing on the old Apple TV,
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.360]  because the old Apple TV didn't really have an app store,
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:44.720]  and they had to work out partnerships.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:47.800]  And I always just assumed that it's because
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.300]  the two companies don't like each other,
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:51.240]  and they couldn't bear to work something like this out,
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.720]  but that once they had an app store,
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:55.480]  Amazon would just build the app, submit it to Apple,
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:56.920]  and they wouldn't have to talk to EdiQ
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.420]  or anything like that, there'd be no deal.
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:02.140]  And of course, I would assume that they would set it up
[02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:04.640]  so that you can't sign up for Amazon Prime
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.720]  through your Apple TV, because then they'd have
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.280]  to give Apple 30%, you'd still have to go
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:11.200]  to Amazon.com on some other device
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.160]  and sign up there to do the payment stuff.
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.840]  And that if you wanted to buy a movie
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.120]  or something like that, you'd have to do it
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.600]  on another device so that Apple doesn't get their 30%.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.240]  Totally understand that, that level of spite.
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:25.620]  But for the stuff that you get for free
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.520]  with your Amazon Prime, the fact that they don't have
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:30.780]  a cool app on this, it makes me angry.
[02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:32.540]  And they've got really good content on there.
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.860]  Transparent was an amazing show.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:37.320]  And if they're a content studio,
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.980]  if Amazon is a content studio, why the hell
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:43.620]  would they cut off a limb and not distribute it
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:48.500]  on probably the most viable content distribution mechanism
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:49.580]  that there is?
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:54.240]  I don't get it, and I know that they want people
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:56.440]  to buy the Fire TV and stuff like that,
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.740]  and I'm sure people who are their most diehard users will,
[02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:01.740]  and they have this great selling, you know,
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.420]  where they can promote it right on the homepage
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:05.160]  of Amazon.com, and they do.
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:09.960]  But I just don't see why they wouldn't wanna be
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:12.400]  on this device with an app.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:14.540]  Yeah, are there diehard Amazon fans
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:19.140]  that will only buy Amazon hardware
[02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:20.500]  and use Amazon software?
[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:22.060]  It doesn't make sense to me.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:26.580]  I don't know, and the fact that you still can do it
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:28.660]  by going to your phone or your iPad
[02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:31.000]  and using the app that they do make for those devices
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.460]  and then air playing it to your Apple TV,
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:37.180]  it's like you're not keeping me from watching it
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.260]  through my Apple TV.
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:41.340]  You're just making me use a worse interface
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:44.340]  and one that sometimes gets disconnected
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:46.820]  because AirPlay isn't as rock solid
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:49.460]  as just playing it right through an app on the device.
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:59.180]  Yeah, I hate those apps where you have to actually
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:04.180]  keep this screen active in order to AirPlay out.
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:06.460]  That's so dumb.
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:07.580]  Who designed that?
[02:19:08.460 --> 02:19:12.900]  And every time your TV turns off and the video stops,
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:15.480]  it makes me wanna throw my phone at the TV.
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:18.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.140]  We have a couple minutes left.
[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:24.460]  I wanna bring up your newest thing,
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:26.580]  which is Computer Show.
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.860]  Yes.
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:31.760]  So you go to, number one, this is a wonderful domain.
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:33.740]  You just go to computer.show.
[02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:34.580]  Sure.
[02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:40.900]  It's almost like the URL was picked by somebody
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:42.400]  who doesn't understand the internet,
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:44.340]  like how a web browser works.
[02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:46.500]  What's the host of Computer Show?
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.220]  The host's name is Gary Fabert.
[02:19:50.220 --> 02:19:51.700]  And he's played by?
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:55.720]  Played by an actor or comedian, yeah, Rob Baedeker.
[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:58.320]  Who is amazing.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:01.080]  So I don't wanna spoil too much.
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:03.240]  I wanna be able to talk about this.
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:06.120]  So you linked to it on Daring Fireball,
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.440]  which is extremely awesome.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.640]  Well, and hopefully a lot of people who are listening
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.800]  have already seen it before we talk about it,
[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:13.880]  because some of it, I feel like,
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:15.320]  it's not never gonna be spoiled,
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:18.600]  but the basic premise, though, is that it's a show,
[02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:20.520]  and I used to watch these shows.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:25.520]  It is like a PBS show from 1983 about computers,
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:31.560]  except that the companies and products who are on the show
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:35.320]  are real companies and products in today's computing world.
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:36.160]  Yes.
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:42.220]  That's the high concept, the high conceit of the show.
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:47.280]  So you get to watch a host and co-host
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.000]  from a technology talk show from 1983,
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.720]  stumble through understanding a technology from today,
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:56.680]  which is a pretty simple, straightforward pitch,
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:01.680]  but when executed with an eye towards detail
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:08.160]  and authenticity, it's not just an SNL sketch.
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:10.600]  We really wanted to make it feel like it was in that world,
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:14.000]  and then Rob Baedeker, who brings life into that character,
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.400]  like you wouldn't believe,
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.360]  it just was like a really fun, it was a really fun thing.
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:25.360]  He's amazing, and the first episode premiered
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:28.580]  at XOXO last month.
[02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:32.460]  It was after you guys had a live episode
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:34.080]  of You Look Nice Today, which was great,
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:34.920]  and the crowd was really into it,
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.580]  and everybody was in a good mood,
[02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:40.040]  and then afterwards, you premiered this,
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:43.860]  and I mean it, I'm not just blowing smoke up
[02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:45.360]  your beautiful, beautiful butt,
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:48.520]  but it blew the roof off the dump.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:50.840]  I mean, people went nuts.
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.740]  Is that the first time you've had a thing premiere
[02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.080]  in front of a live audience?
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:59.120]  Definitely, I mean, yeah, since film school.
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:00.920]  Film school, we had to show something
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:03.400]  in front of an audience, but that was, yeah,
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:05.920]  I never get to, all my stuff goes out into the internet
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:08.840]  and into a vacuum, and I never really,
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.880]  except for Twitter as a sounding board,
[02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:14.680]  but it was just such a good experience.
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.000]  It was the perfect audience to premiere it for,
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.320]  because they're right in that world of tech slash
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.640]  having a sense of humor and character.
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:28.840]  Did you feel pressure following up
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.920]  what I thought was very clearly
[02:22:30.920 --> 02:22:34.000]  a very, very good live episode of You Look Nice Today?
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.680]  Totally, I could have killed it.
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:38.800]  I could have crushed the mood entirely,
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:42.700]  and also, I felt a little bit bad that,
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:46.200]  because I was gonna, I had asked the Andes
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:50.480]  if I could premiere, if I could premiere the episode
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:54.000]  at their video, in one of the slots,
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.400]  if there was an open slot for their video shorts program,
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:01.700]  and Andy was so into the idea that he was like,
[02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:05.480]  oh, you could go up right after You Look Nice Today,
[02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:07.520]  and I felt really bad, and I also felt
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:10.920]  there was a huge elevated stakes,
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:14.560]  but yeah, it totally went well, and it was so fun,
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:18.960]  but the reception from having shown them on the internet
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.240]  has been so positive that we're really like,
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:23.080]  we're gearing up to do more of them.
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:26.080]  What is the holdup to do more?
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:28.720]  Well, they were actually quite resource intensive
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:32.560]  to do, to produce the three episodes that we did,
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:34.040]  and one of them we've had to withhold
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:39.040]  because the subject of the show,
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:41.040]  the guest on the show was not,
[02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:44.360]  the PR person behind that company
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.440]  was not super amenable to...
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.440]  How it went down.
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:51.580]  Yeah, well, not how it went down,
[02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:54.040]  but just they were uncomfortable with the whole idea
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:57.920]  of the humor of the concept.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:00.760]  But didn't know what they were getting into beforehand?
[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.880]  Yeah, it was weird.
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.680]  The backstory is that, without giving away too much,
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:08.200]  the backstory is that this person
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:10.000]  was uncomfortable a little bit,
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.060]  or that the guest wasn't, but the PR company was,
[02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:17.920]  and so in order to get that person on as a guest
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:21.080]  to follow through, the PR company,
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.720]  we basically said, listen, you have the right
[02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:25.560]  to pull the episode if you don't like it,
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:27.840]  because I was so confident that it would go well,
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.200]  and then it went well, and we made a really funny episode
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.200]  out of it, and then the PR company,
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:35.160]  when right before we launched the show,
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.320]  was just like, no, we're gonna exercise that right,
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:41.320]  and it's like, we'll sit this round out,
[02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:42.360]  and it really sucked.
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:44.920]  Someday it'll see the light of day, hopefully.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.000]  This is what I love about you.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.860]  I love about you that you are, you're such a,
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:52.520]  I'm sure you might have gone through other emotions earlier,
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:56.000]  but you say this, and there's no sense of bitterness
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.320]  in your voice at all.
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:59.940]  Well, you know, because when something like this happens,
[02:24:59.940 --> 02:25:03.360]  I just have this sense that they'll get whatever.
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:06.680]  They'll get what's coming to them eventually.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.600]  No way, I think we made something really good,
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:10.440]  and they could have gotten a lot of benefit from it,
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:13.720]  but if they choose to not participate in that benefit,
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.560]  then that's their deal, but the important part
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.480]  is that we're making more of them.
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:21.880]  We're gonna get different partners on board
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:26.880]  and involve different money people,
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:30.120]  money people involve different startups and guests
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.300]  and corporate sponsors and things,
[02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:35.400]  and so really, at this phase,
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.540]  we're gearing up to do more episodes,
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:42.540]  and if there are any, I extend this to your audience,
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.100]  if there are startups out there
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.020]  that feel like they're gonna be perfectly suited
[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:48.820]  to somehow being featured on the show,
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.820]  then definitely get in touch.
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:53.580]  One of the things I love about it is that the premise
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:58.060]  is sort of, the basic premise is very easy.
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:00.620]  It's modern technology as seen through the eyes
[02:26:00.620 --> 02:26:03.960]  of a 1983 computer technology show,
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.740]  but after that, it's all hand-wavy,
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:09.620]  and there's never any explanation
[02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:12.220]  as to how this could be happening,
[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:15.700]  because the hosts of the show clearly
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:18.740]  haven't been around since 1983, right?
[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:20.660]  I mean, he looks like he's about my age,
[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:25.660]  so he was about 10 in 1983, and there's no explanation,
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:28.620]  and there's no argument, there's no sense
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.220]  that there was some sort of time machine
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:31.220]  or anything like that.
[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:34.340]  It's just this inexplicable hand-wavy mismatch
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:39.340]  of a host and a show, and the set design
[02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:44.620]  and the camera angles combined with modern technology.
[02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:46.700]  And then the best part, and this is, again,
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:48.300]  it speaks to, like you said,
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.300]  the production costs that go into this
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:53.300]  is that when it's demo time,
[02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:56.660]  the demos are done on an Apple IIe.
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:01.340]  I think it would be a mistake.
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:03.160]  I am comfortable showing an iPhone
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:05.700]  in the world of a computer show.
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:09.700]  I would not be comfortable showing a MacBook or an iMac.
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:13.320]  Well, there's a demo on an iPhone on the one episode,
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:16.860]  and what is it, Gary, right?
[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:19.180]  Gary calls it a calculator.
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:22.820]  Yeah, yeah, and I look at the racquetball
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:24.100]  on that tiny calculator.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:28.860]  And he's not that impressed by it.
[02:27:28.860 --> 02:27:32.740]  That's what kills me, is that he's really into computers,
[02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:35.500]  and he's like an enthusiast as to the Apple IIe,
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:39.300]  but when he sees an iPhone, he's not impressed by it.
[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:41.260]  That's right, I mean, it's like showing,
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:43.500]  it's like the opening scene from 2001.
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:47.500]  Ultimately, how impressed are those apes gonna be
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:49.740]  by that monolith?
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.580]  It's not that different.
[02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:54.660]  Or if you gave one of those apes an iPad Pro,
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:57.980]  they would just use it to beat over the hell out
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.140]  of the rival tribe.
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:03.420]  Yeah, and I love, so yeah, I mean, you hit on that.
[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:07.740]  We never wanna explain the mechanics of the world
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:10.140]  because it's so much more fun not to,
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:12.540]  but the way I think of it is like,
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:17.220]  it's kinda like one of those, a movie plot
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:20.540]  where somebody magically gets transported
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:22.540]  into a TV show that they're watching,
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.700]  and they'll appear into, like in the fictional world
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.020]  of the TV show that they're watching.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:33.100]  You never question how that happened.
[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:34.820]  It was just supernatural.
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:38.260]  And so that's kind of the same logic in this universe.
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:40.100]  Your brain fills in the gaps
[02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:42.420]  with like a sort of touchy feely, well,
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.620]  it's somehow this happened and you accept it
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:47.340]  in a way that if it was explained,
[02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:49.820]  your brain would be like, well, that makes no sense.
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.740]  If you explained it, your brain would reject
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:53.660]  the explanation as having made no sense
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:55.300]  because there's no way that this could make sense.
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.020]  And if you don't explain it,
[02:28:57.020 --> 02:29:00.060]  this is what makes it funny to me
[02:29:00.060 --> 02:29:03.180]  is that your brain just fills it in with, okay, whatever.
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:04.380]  I'll accept this for now.
[02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:05.300]  What are they gonna do?
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.980]  And then, oh my God, this is hilarious.
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:10.620]  How did you make the graphics for the Apple IIe stuff?
[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:15.620]  That was done by our editor, Zena Gray,
[02:29:15.700 --> 02:29:20.100]  who was, she was wonderful to work with.
[02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:25.100]  And she just did really cool, just retro graphics
[02:29:25.140 --> 02:29:28.020]  and comped them in the screen convincingly.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:30.620]  And then all of the motion logos
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:32.340]  at the head of the show and everything
[02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:35.300]  were done by just this guy I found on the internet
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.220]  who I'd seen, who I'd found on Vimeo.
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.660]  His work was just so stellar.
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:41.580]  And he did that era of graphics
[02:29:41.580 --> 02:29:44.900]  better than anybody else I'd seen named Jared Hagerman.
[02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:47.420]  And that's my favorite kind of thing,
[02:29:47.420 --> 02:29:49.900]  collaboration where you just find somebody on the internet
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.860]  and you end up working with them for a really long time
[02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:54.340]  and you never actually meet them face to face.
[02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:58.700]  Is he like a younger person who just has a fondness
[02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:01.020]  for that era of motion graphics?
[02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:03.700]  Or was he somebody who was in the motion graphics business
[02:30:03.700 --> 02:30:04.660]  at the time?
[02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:07.180]  No, I'm pretty sure that he's just,
[02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:09.420]  no, that he's a young person.
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:11.980]  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that he's a young person
[02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:14.620]  who just gets the aesthetic so well.
[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:17.980]  It is, as somebody who grew up in that era
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:20.660]  and was a media obsessive,
[02:30:20.660 --> 02:30:22.820]  and I remember even thinking with some of those old,
[02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:24.980]  you know, like the old CBS logo and stuff like that
[02:30:24.980 --> 02:30:27.060]  and the motion, what was that CBS one,
[02:30:27.060 --> 02:30:28.500]  like Special Presentation.
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:29.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:31.740]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:32.580]  Right.
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.540]  The Special Presentation thing,
[02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:39.260]  I remember thinking like maybe once I'd seen it
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:40.180]  a couple times, I remember thinking,
[02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:42.020]  wait, how the hell did they make that?
[02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:42.860]  Right.
[02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:43.900]  Because it doesn't make any sense
[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:45.620]  that anybody could make that by hand
[02:30:45.620 --> 02:30:47.460]  the way they do hand drawn animation.
[02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:53.220]  And the integrity of that style of graphic
[02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:55.940]  in the computer show is just 100%.
[02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:59.380]  It is exactly, if I didn't know better,
[02:30:59.380 --> 02:31:01.540]  I wouldn't think that somehow you found it
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:03.740]  in 30 year old footage.
[02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:05.900]  Yeah, it would be fun to like go back
[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:07.460]  and use all the tools that they did,
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:12.220]  like the Chiron or there was something called a squeezoom
[02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.820]  with a joystick, like broadcast stations
[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:16.460]  would use something called a squeezoom,
[02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:18.700]  which was like a joystick where you could like
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:21.660]  basically just fly the rectangle of the video frame
[02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:25.180]  around in two dimensional space
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:28.260]  and do page peels and stuff like that.
[02:31:28.260 --> 02:31:31.020]  But ultimately the way to reproduce it now
[02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:32.740]  is just you use After Effects,
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.780]  but you do it like really like specifically
[02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:37.900]  and hand craft the look.
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:40.860]  It just feels exactly right.
[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:43.940]  And it doesn't come across as caricature.
[02:31:43.940 --> 02:31:45.620]  It's not caricaturing the style.
[02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:50.620]  It is exactly lovingly in the same serious tone.
[02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:53.860]  Thank you.
[02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:56.300]  Well, the most fun for me is that
[02:31:56.300 --> 02:31:58.340]  like the original program that we were referencing
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.820]  is called the Computer Chronicles
[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:02.260]  and it was hosted and started by a guy named
[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:07.020]  Stuart Shafay and he tweeted that he saw the show
[02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:10.300]  and I asked him, would you be on sometime?
[02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:11.180]  And he said, totally.
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:14.820]  So that'll be a dream come true.
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.700]  Oh my God, that is so great.
[02:32:18.580 --> 02:32:19.780]  That is absolutely amazing.
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:23.460]  Are there episodes of the Computer Chronicles on YouTube?
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:24.980]  Oh yeah, just search for it.
[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:26.900]  There's the whole catalog is there.
[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:31.620]  It went from 83 through mid 90s, I think.
[02:32:31.620 --> 02:32:32.460]  Excellent.
[02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:36.260]  Anything else that you wanna promote?
[02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:40.300]  No, no, just I won't promote you
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:41.460]  cause you're my friend.
[02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:45.060]  Everybody should listen to the talk show.
[02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:46.300]  Read Daring Fireball.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.340]  Well, you know what people should do
[02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:50.060]  if I'm gonna take a moment of self-promotion.
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:53.420]  Go into your Overcast app if you're using Overcast
[02:32:53.420 --> 02:32:55.780]  and what do you do to shows in there?
[02:32:55.780 --> 02:32:57.380]  You recommend them or something?
[02:32:58.660 --> 02:32:59.820]  I don't know.
[02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:01.820]  Well, go in there and recommend the talk show
[02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:03.700]  or promote it or there's something you can do in there
[02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:05.500]  because the only thing that makes me mad
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:07.020]  is a couple of weeks ago where Marco and I
[02:33:07.020 --> 02:33:09.900]  were talking about this Hello Internet show
[02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:13.700]  with CGP Gray and Brady.
[02:33:15.100 --> 02:33:16.780]  Haran, Haran, I'm not quite sure
[02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:17.740]  how to pronounce his surname.
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:19.580]  But anyway, next thing you know,
[02:33:20.660 --> 02:33:22.020]  I got all these emails from people saying,
[02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:22.900]  wow, I never heard of that show.
[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:24.180]  It is amazing, I love it.
[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:25.220]  And next thing you know,
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:27.020]  it's like the number one show in Overcast.
[02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:28.700]  It even jumped ahead of ATP,
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:30.580]  but it jumped ahead of my show, too.
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:34.780]  And I just feel like, well, how about we put
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:35.900]  the talk show up there?
[02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:38.100]  Yeah, get a little love for Daddy.
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:39.900]  Everybody.
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:45.660]  Anyway, Adam Lisagor, thank you so much
[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:48.100]  for your generous time.
[02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:50.260]  Thanks for having me, this was really fun.
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:52.360]  When do you think, is there a schedule
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:54.140]  for more computer shows or is it?
[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:57.400]  Yeah, we're gonna try to shoot them in early next year,
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:33:59.740]  like February, and then spend a while.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.260]  You know, we're doing it kind of more
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:03.920]  like closer to a real show.
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:06.260]  So there's writing and pre-production
[02:34:06.260 --> 02:34:09.220]  and post-production that has to be done.
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:11.500]  Yeah, and so these are sort of like,
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:15.180]  in the modern era, where shows are sort of,
[02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:17.340]  they're not 30, 30 minutes long,
[02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:20.100]  it's sort of like a two-episode pilot.
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:20.940]  Right, yeah.
[02:34:20.940 --> 02:34:23.540]  And now people know exactly what they're getting into.
[02:34:23.540 --> 02:34:27.620]  Yeah, and we'll extend that in different directions,
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:30.580]  we'll come up with new segments, and I don't know.
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:32.580]  If there's any way I can help.
[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:33.580]  I would love that.
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:37.060]  Well, I need you to be on as a guest, of course.
[02:34:37.060 --> 02:34:38.260]  It's my dream.
[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:41.140]  I'll just hang it up after I'm on the computer.
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:42.500]  We'll do it.
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:43.700]  Adam, thank you.
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:53.700]  Thanks, Sean.
