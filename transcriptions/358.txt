[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I don't have that much content. Let's do an ad right now. Let's
[00:04.000 --> 00:09.760]  start with an ad. All right, we can talk about Squarespace. We
[00:09.760 --> 00:12.160]  could do that we can do we can definitely start with an ad
[00:12.160 --> 00:15.200]  Paul and I can tell you right now right off right off the
[00:15.200 --> 00:18.280]  start. I can tell you that in fact, Squarespace is is a
[00:18.280 --> 00:22.080]  sponsor of the show there. Nail up. You've probably heard of
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.320]  them. Squarespace is all joking aside. Seriously, it's it is the
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.360]  number one place that I recommend. I honestly recommend
[00:30.400 --> 00:35.120]  that people would go to set up create, modify, continue editing
[00:35.160 --> 00:39.280]  and publishing a new website. Everything is built in. They've
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.240]  got analytics, they've got templates to choose from.
[00:42.680 --> 00:45.400]  They've got the content management tools you need for
[00:45.400 --> 00:48.320]  like if you want to keep a blog going on your Squarespace site,
[00:48.320 --> 00:52.320]  you could do that. You want to sell stuff online store, of
[00:52.320 --> 00:55.440]  course they do that you name it, they've got it everything you
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.120]  need all in one including domain name registration. So where do
[00:59.120 --> 01:02.320]  you go to find out more and let them know you're you've got

[01:24.840 --> 01:29.920]  One down, one down five to go. Maybe only four to go. Are you
[01:29.920 --> 01:33.720]  following the the home run race? Some I'm he's still stuck at 60
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.240]  right? Yeah, he had as we record as we record today on Wednesday,
[01:39.280 --> 01:42.040]  the 28th. Now, by the time people listen to us, he might
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.400]  have already have Jared jizz. We're talking about Aaron judge
[01:44.400 --> 01:48.080]  from the New York Yankees. He's at 60 home runs. The American
[01:48.080 --> 01:51.120]  League record is 61. That's what people are talking about. I
[01:51.120 --> 01:54.480]  want to I'll come back to that. By the time people listen to us,
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.080]  he might be at 61. He might be at 62. He could could be at 63.
[01:58.080 --> 02:01.160]  Who knows? He more than that. Yeah. Right. But last night, he
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.800]  went, he went, did he even have a plate appear? Or did he even
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.400]  have enough bad he got? He got four walks, I heard he had four
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.920]  walks last night against the Toronto Blue Jays with that's
[02:08.920 --> 02:11.360]  part of that's part of the game, right? And it's, you know, I
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.000]  mean, the Blue Jays are in it. So right, you know, they, it's
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.360]  legitimate for that, because the night before he got intentionally
[02:16.360 --> 02:19.480]  walked, and they won the game, the Blue Jays won the game,
[02:19.480 --> 02:22.680]  which they needed. So you can't fault them for that. Right?
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.120]  Right. There's, there's no, whatever reluctance any team has,
[02:27.160 --> 02:32.400]  and any pitcher might have to be the team and the pitcher to give
[02:32.400 --> 02:36.120]  up a record breaking remembered home run. You don't have to be a
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.600]  sports psychologist to to get that nobody really wants to be
[02:39.600 --> 02:41.800]  that pitcher. The Blue Jays are definitely trying to win.
[02:41.880 --> 02:44.240]  They're not walking them for that reason. I listened to the
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.320]  the Keith Olbermann has brought back his old TV show countdown
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.000]  is now a podcast. And it's, I just love it. It's literally
[02:53.240 --> 02:56.440]  with with overcast speed ratings. I get through in about
[02:56.440 --> 02:58.920]  half an hour. It's like a half hour a day, like a daily news
[02:58.920 --> 03:01.920]  podcast. But of course, Keith Olbermann, while the main focus
[03:01.920 --> 03:06.200]  of his show is US National Affairs, for lack of a better
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.200]  term, he's a big, big base on a sports sports band. Yeah, he
[03:10.200 --> 03:14.600]  used to used to be a ESPN SportsCenter. That's probably
[03:14.600 --> 03:18.160]  where most people in the 90s got to know him. Certainly came to
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.560]  national Dan Patrick, right, right. The sort of still famous
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.360]  as like, maybe is it nostalgia? I don't know, probably my mind,
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.920]  the seminal duo, who ran SportsCenter, my favorite running
[03:28.920 --> 03:35.040]  gag of the era was they were the 90s of the the Dan Patrick
[03:35.080 --> 03:39.960]  Keith Olbermann SportsCenter was every weekend, they were
[03:39.960 --> 03:43.080]  doing SportsCenter. And there's a NASCAR race on they would tell
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.760]  you who came in first who came in second who came in third, and
[03:46.760 --> 03:53.720]  where Dick Trickle finished. Of course. Dick Trickle was a NASCAR
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.520]  racer with a very amusing name. And they would never say why but
[03:59.520 --> 04:02.440]  they would just say so and so came in first second and here
[04:02.440 --> 04:07.160]  was third and Dick Trickle finished 21st. And they wouldn't
[04:07.160 --> 04:09.320]  laugh, they wouldn't giggle, but they would always tell you where
[04:09.320 --> 04:12.560]  Dick Trickle finished. Anyway, my favorite, I think it was
[04:12.560 --> 04:15.080]  Olbermann was they were talking, they must have been talking
[04:15.080 --> 04:18.280]  about a baseball game. And he said, that's a that's an E7, an
[04:18.280 --> 04:20.680]  error on the on the left fielder. That's an E7 if you're
[04:20.680 --> 04:27.560]  scoring at home, or even if you're alone. That's a little
[04:27.560 --> 04:31.320]  bit of a thinker. You gotta it takes a second, but it does. So
[04:31.360 --> 04:34.480]  anyway, I Olbermann has been talking about the home run race
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.800]  and there are so many weird, baseball is such a weird sport.
[04:37.800 --> 04:43.000]  And I we have nerd stuff to talk about. But it everyone loves
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.480]  when we talk about baseball. Absolutely definitely do. But
[04:45.480 --> 04:49.240]  but the very strangest thing about baseball in the US at
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.080]  least is that it predates all the other major sports by
[04:54.080 --> 04:57.320]  decades that the history of Major League Baseball goes back
[04:57.320 --> 05:02.120]  to like the 1870s 1860s. I mean, we're talking like when
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.440]  Lincoln's assassination was fresh news, fresh. And the rules
[05:07.440 --> 05:11.960]  were very different. And like I know some of this, but I forget
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.160]  it over time, just how different some of the rules are. But you
[05:15.160 --> 05:20.280]  know, at one point, it was five balls to get a walk. Okay, there
[05:20.280 --> 05:23.840]  was one season, the the all time Major League record, I don't
[05:23.840 --> 05:26.720]  have it offhand here in front of me. But the all time Major
[05:26.720 --> 05:29.880]  League record for batting average, if you just go through
[05:29.880 --> 05:32.840]  every season and pick the player who finished a season with the
[05:32.840 --> 05:36.520]  highest batting average is not the record that most people
[05:36.520 --> 05:39.560]  generally most people go to Rogers Hornsby, who I think
[05:39.560 --> 05:44.920]  batted 420 something in 1920 might have been 420 in 1920. But
[05:44.960 --> 05:47.800]  that's not the highest recording batting average in Major League
[05:47.800 --> 05:52.480]  Baseball, some guy in like 1871 hit 497 or something like that.
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.440]  But but what was different? They count was a walk a walk was a
[05:56.440 --> 05:59.880]  hit. Yeah, I thought I think I knew that for one season. So it
[05:59.880 --> 06:04.600]  was in today's terms, is on base percentage, which is still a
[06:04.600 --> 06:08.360]  very, very, very good on base percentage. But so now now I'm
[06:08.360 --> 06:13.200]  looking up what was bonds is OBP in that year when he broke the
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.000]  walk record, and it was six Oh, it'd be Yeah, 609, which is
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.680]  crazy, just insane to think in that sport where it's so
[06:21.680 --> 06:25.640]  notoriously difficult to to get on base get on base. It wasn't
[06:25.640 --> 06:28.480]  even close that he was on base. He was on base three out of five
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.160]  times. Yeah. I'm trying to think what else the gist of it is
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.560]  people, there's sort of two sides on this home run record
[06:37.560 --> 06:42.840]  where to sort of stay above the fray, people are talking about
[06:42.840 --> 06:45.400]  the American League, the American League, which is 61.
[06:45.400 --> 06:48.520]  And then there's a nice number. And it's near and dear to Yankee
[06:48.520 --> 06:52.520]  fans hearts because the original record holder in the American
[06:52.520 --> 06:56.440]  League was Babe Ruth 1927. And then the first player to beat it
[06:56.440 --> 07:01.840]  was also a Yankee Roger Maris in what was it 1961 61 because it
[07:01.840 --> 07:04.440]  was 61 and 61 is easy to remember, right, sort of like
[07:04.440 --> 07:08.840]  the Rogers Hornsby 420 in 1920, which I might be I might be
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.920]  wrong about. But it sounds good. I know it for Maris. It's
[07:12.920 --> 07:17.120]  definitely Yeah, 61 and 61. But there's a lot of fans. Do you
[07:17.120 --> 07:19.760]  don't have to be a Yankee fan. There's a lot of fans who view
[07:20.360 --> 07:27.440]  all of the season home run marks above 61 as being a bit suspect
[07:28.080 --> 07:29.000]  because of the
[07:30.200 --> 07:33.720]  was there was there something unusual in the 90s in baseball
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.840]  drive the the single season home run record above. Here's what
[07:38.840 --> 07:44.000]  they are. So tied at 10th is Babe Ruth at 59 in 1921. I
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.920]  forgot that John Carlos Stanton hit 59 in 2017. Babe Ruth is 60
[07:48.920 --> 07:53.240]  was 1927 Aaron judges already tied with him, then Roger Maris
[07:53.240 --> 07:58.520]  61 and 61. And now you get to the late 90s. Number six is Sammy
[07:58.520 --> 08:07.520]  Sosa 99 was 63. Sosa in 2001 hit 64 Mark Maguire hit 65 and 99.
[08:08.080 --> 08:15.200]  Sammy Sosa hit 66 in 98. Mark Maguire hit 70 in 98. And then
[08:15.200 --> 08:20.400]  in 2001, Barry Bonds hit 73 and three, right. So Maguire is on
[08:20.400 --> 08:26.800]  there a couple of times. So says on there 123 times 9098 99 in
[08:26.800 --> 08:30.200]  2001. I don't know what happened to him in 2000. Yeah, they're
[08:30.240 --> 08:31.400]  they're all bunched together.
[08:33.320 --> 08:37.320]  And everybody knows that it was the steroid era performance
[08:37.320 --> 08:41.160]  enhancing drugs era of baseball. But there's no asterisks next to
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.880]  any of those records, because no, it wasn't technically
[08:44.880 --> 08:47.960]  against the rules. People. I mean, it's a very complicated
[08:47.960 --> 08:53.560]  area, right? Nobody they did. In the backlash to it did set some
[08:53.560 --> 08:56.040]  none of those guys are in the Hall of Fame, right? None of
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.720]  those guys are in the Hall of Fame, but none of them are
[08:57.720 --> 09:00.440]  banned from like Pete Rose is literally banned from being in
[09:00.440 --> 09:02.360]  the Hall of Fame. They're not the voters don't even get to
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.160]  vote for him. Because baseball determined that he broke this,
[09:06.160 --> 09:08.720]  that and the other rule and as a lifetime suspension from
[09:08.720 --> 09:12.720]  baseball. None of these guys got suspended. None of these guys
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.880]  are banned. These are the records. It's the way it was.
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.400]  Right. So so yeah, when people say the legitimate home run
[09:20.400 --> 09:23.640]  record, I don't know this, these things happened. I remember the
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.520]  home run races between the McGuire and Sosa and bonds is
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.440]  ridiculous season they happen. Those are the numbers. So I
[09:31.440 --> 09:33.720]  think I think focusing on the American League record makes
[09:33.720 --> 09:35.240]  more sense. Just calling it that way.
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.960]  Yeah, and the fans, the fans, I think the fans sort of have the
[09:39.960 --> 09:44.760]  right attitude or the fans if he gave if he gets to 61 or even 62
[09:44.800 --> 09:47.520]  then the fans will certainly Yankee fans will be happy. But I
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.000]  think baseball fans in general want to see it happen. And if
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  people want to consider it the the legitimate home run record,
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.560]  that's that's up to them. It doesn't really it doesn't make
[09:57.560 --> 09:58.800]  that big a difference, really.
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.360]  Well, do you know that until I think like until the 90s, there
[10:02.360 --> 10:07.240]  was an asterisk on Maris's record? Yeah, because he did it
[10:07.240 --> 10:13.040]  in 162 games, Babe Ruth hit 60 in 154 games. And so judge did
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.640]  60 and 154. And the sort of the hope was that he would break 60
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.960]  in 154 or fewer. And obviously, he just tied that. But yeah,
[10:21.960 --> 10:25.080]  there's that. I mean, it's all it's all meaningless. Anyway,
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.560]  ultimately, there's not any money attached to this. There's
[10:27.560 --> 10:30.640]  not any directly anyway. It's just it's just fun numbers to
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.880]  debate. And so you can have a nice bar debate over who should
[10:33.880 --> 10:36.080]  be considered the greatest home run hitter or whatever.
[10:36.200 --> 10:38.800]  So what? Let me get personal, though. Now you're a Red Sox
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.640]  fan. What? I am. Yes. So how even this season? How? How does
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.440]  how does that? Where does that put you in terms of how do you
[10:48.440 --> 10:51.440]  like, are you seeing judge do that? Yeah. Were you hoping he'd
[10:51.440 --> 10:54.800]  get stuck on 59? Because screw me as a Yankee? Or are you like,
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.080]  well, but the other guys are Yankees anyway. Right. So like,
[10:58.080 --> 11:00.040]  Aaron judge seems like a nice enough guy. I have no problem
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.120]  with him. He's not like, usually you pick one guy on the other
[11:03.120 --> 11:05.640]  team that you don't like. And for a while was Brett Gardner,
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.520]  who's no longer on the team. And for no good reason anyway, but
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.680]  what you don't like who you didn't like. You didn't like
[11:10.680 --> 11:14.960]  Brett Gardner? No, no, I hated Brett Gardner. Hated him. Just
[11:14.960 --> 11:16.920]  for no good reason. Like I said, all right. I don't know. Well,
[11:16.920 --> 11:19.360]  he was on the team forever. So that was part of it. But yeah, I
[11:19.360 --> 11:22.360]  don't know. Like I don't. Well, the thing was judge, he had a
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.440]  shot at doing it before they faced the Red Sox. Then they
[11:25.440 --> 11:28.120]  played the Red Sox for four games this past weekend. And so
[11:28.120 --> 11:30.720]  the concern was he would do it against the Red Sox. So I guess
[11:30.720 --> 11:33.240]  like that I was rooting for him to not do it this past weekend.
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.520]  Right. But yeah, if he if he hits, I'll tell you what I would
[11:36.520 --> 11:39.680]  love I would have liked to have seen him hit 74 then we don't
[11:39.680 --> 11:42.760]  have to have this debate about the steroids. And so hopefully
[11:42.760 --> 11:46.640]  somebody some year legitimately hit 74 home runs. I don't know
[11:46.640 --> 11:48.640]  if it'll if it'll ever happen. But you know, I don't have a
[11:48.640 --> 11:51.080]  negative opinion about it. I don't I don't think I think at
[11:51.080 --> 11:53.640]  this point, he's probably going to do it and good for him. And
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.600]  I'll tell you what, you might be upset because next year, he
[11:55.600 --> 11:56.640]  might be a New York Met.
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.760]  I don't know. I don't want to think about it. Exactly. It
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.400]  would have been better if they'd signed him before the season.
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.400]  Yes, before. Before he had one of the greatest seasons of all
[12:06.400 --> 12:09.200]  times in a contract here. Yeah, I think that would have been
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.480]  better for them. He did do he did the thing that Derek Jeter
[12:12.480 --> 12:15.120]  used to always do, you know, and then Jeter stay to Yankee his
[12:15.120 --> 12:17.560]  whole career, but you get towards the end of your career
[12:17.560 --> 12:20.200]  and you get shorter and shorter contracts and you kind of it
[12:20.200 --> 12:23.520]  comes up more often. It's like one time in the prime of your
[12:23.520 --> 12:26.240]  career where you sign like a 10 year deal, and then you don't
[12:26.240 --> 12:29.440]  have to, you don't have to renegotiate for a decade. But
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.000]  when when Jeter's contracts are up, he'd always refused to we
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.240]  can either make a deal before the season starts or after that
[12:36.240 --> 12:39.360]  season. But I'm not I'm not I'm not going to spend even one
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.800]  minute thinking about this during the season, which isn't
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.960]  an unreasonable position. And I think also a lot of players do
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.400]  that. Yeah. And I think it's sort of it creates a deadline
[12:49.400 --> 12:52.000]  for the team to make their best offer before the season. It's
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.120]  it's not a bad negotiating tactic either, in addition to
[12:55.120 --> 12:58.920]  being a way to stay focused on the game and compartmentalize
[12:58.920 --> 13:01.800]  it. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Before we leave the subject, I
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.480]  will bring up the fact that the over the weekend, the the Friday
[13:05.480 --> 13:10.600]  night baseball game on Apple TV was the Sox Yankees game, right?
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.240]  And because of Aaron judge being at 60, it almost had to
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.440]  Apple, it doesn't release Ben Thompson. And I talked about
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.840]  this on dithering, but I'll go over it here. That the weird
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.840]  thing about these streaming services like Apple TV plus and
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.680]  Amazon Prime, compared to traditional TV, is that in
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.720]  traditional TV, networks love to brag about the ratings. And for
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.000]  my whole lifetime decades, and they'd be like, Oh, last
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.080]  night's Monday Night Football game was the highest rated 39
[13:44.080 --> 13:47.080]  million people watch. Yeah, 39 million people watch it was the
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.160]  highest rated regular season NFL game in seven years or something
[13:51.160 --> 13:54.320]  like that. They'd love to say stuff like that. And instead,
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.400]  what everybody does now is effectively I think gives out
[13:57.400 --> 14:00.720]  the Bezos numbers, which is 200% more than last week. Yeah, it
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.240]  was it was 1.3 times as bad Apple hasn't I don't think said
[14:04.240 --> 14:06.600]  anything like that about it. But if they did, surely they would
[14:06.600 --> 14:10.040]  give a number like it was 1.6 times higher than the second
[14:10.040 --> 14:13.120]  rated Friday Night Baseball game of the year. But without a
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.720]  baseline, you don't know what that means. But so wait, did
[14:15.720 --> 14:17.600]  they say anything? No, I don't. I don't think they said
[14:17.600 --> 14:20.080]  anything. You're just assuming it was it was well watched. But
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.280]  it was the fact that it was on it was the first time to my
[14:24.320 --> 14:28.360]  record recognition all season, where my worlds have collide. I
[14:28.360 --> 14:30.400]  think you and I talked about this when you were on six months
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.720]  ago at the outside. Right? Yep. Right. When they started
[14:32.760 --> 14:36.040]  right broadcast, because they just announced the Apple had the
[14:36.040 --> 14:39.880]  Friday Night Baseball deal. And you and me being baseball fans,
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.160]  we talked about it. This was the first time that I'm aware of
[14:43.160 --> 14:46.960]  that Friday Night Baseball was somewhat controversial, because
[14:47.680 --> 14:50.360]  it was a game everyone wanted to watch. And people don't know how
[14:50.360 --> 14:53.280]  to watch stuff on streaming. Right, right. Are people
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.000]  confused by it? Does it make it worse? Do people think, hey, I
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.880]  don't even own any Apple products. So I can't watch this
[14:59.880 --> 15:03.640]  right? I have an Android phone. I don't I don't have I use a PC.
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.680]  Why? How am I supposed to watch Apple TV? Do are people confused
[15:07.680 --> 15:12.440]  by the fact that the service is called Apple TV, and they have a
[15:12.440 --> 15:15.160]  product product, a physical hardware product called Apple
[15:15.160 --> 15:21.120]  TV. And then when you're in the TV OS, the app you use to watch
[15:21.120 --> 15:27.120]  the sports is called TV. It are I'm confused by it just trying
[15:27.120 --> 15:30.440]  to describe it to my audience who I know, knows this very
[15:30.440 --> 15:33.120]  well. No, it's been bad naming for a couple years, and they
[15:33.120 --> 15:36.120]  have not made it better. But well, I'll tell you what, I
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.360]  think it's interesting that obviously, this finally happened
[15:38.360 --> 15:40.280]  that there was a game where people wanted to check it out.
[15:40.280 --> 15:44.600]  And I think it's good for for the service because it, somebody
[15:44.600 --> 15:47.360]  explained it to, like their parents, they said, Oh, you want
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.640]  to watch this game. Here's how you do it. And right now they
[15:49.640 --> 15:51.800]  know how to do it. And that's I think that's exactly what Apple
[15:51.800 --> 15:55.200]  wanted was was more of these marquee games where people would
[15:55.200 --> 15:58.320]  tune in just for that and learn how to use the service. Right
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.560]  people. People will complain about anything on Twitter and
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.320]  the internet as a whole. So I tried not to ever take it too
[16:05.600 --> 16:09.200]  personally or get too annoyed by it. But there I what I saw last
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.440]  week leading up to that game, especially probably in the day
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.880]  before when it was clear from the night before that he hadn't
[16:15.880 --> 16:18.800]  already broken the record. Was there people saying that what
[16:18.800 --> 16:24.200]  Apple should do is let let the the Yankees network Yes, that's
[16:24.200 --> 16:27.840]  their traditional regional sports network. Let them
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.440]  broadcast the game too. So that people who are used to Yankees
[16:31.440 --> 16:33.400]  fans are who are used to watching them. And yes, can
[16:33.400 --> 16:40.200]  catch it on Yes, as well. Oh, no. Right? No. I mean, just
[16:40.200 --> 16:45.720]  obviously, no. Can you even imagine if that reached any cues
[16:45.720 --> 16:50.720]  desk? Like how do you would react to that? Like, he might
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.240]  still be laughing now. Now, five days later, he might still be
[16:55.240 --> 16:55.760]  laughing.
[16:56.440 --> 16:59.800]  I mean, like, I get the I get the request that Oh, I want it
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.560]  to be easy, whatever. But watching Apple TV is not
[17:02.560 --> 17:05.560]  actually difficult. You need to figure something out. You need
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.640]  to either you can do it in a browser, can't you? Yeah, yeah.
[17:08.680 --> 17:10.880]  Right. So so you don't need any hardware, you just need a
[17:10.880 --> 17:13.960]  computer, whatever. If it were actually something where you
[17:13.960 --> 17:15.920]  know, oh, people aren't going to be able to watch it for
[17:15.920 --> 17:18.480]  whatever reason, then this could make sense. But no, the
[17:18.480 --> 17:20.480]  whole reason they made the surface and the whole reason
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.680]  they got Friday Night Baseball was to get people to come watch
[17:22.680 --> 17:26.040]  the game. Right? They want to give away the most important one
[17:26.040 --> 17:28.720]  of the year. It'll be nice, not nice gesture.
[17:29.360 --> 17:32.400]  And even if it was just for the New York Yankees fans, it's
[17:32.400 --> 17:35.640]  still who's the most? Who's the most likely fan base in
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.840]  baseball? Right. And if I think I think that a big reason that
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.200]  Apple is edging its way into sports, Amazon is to is to
[17:45.240 --> 17:48.720]  increase. It's not that sports in itself itself is all that
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.120]  valuable. It's that it gets them to expand the user base, right?
[17:54.120 --> 17:58.520]  So you are Netflix already has the stranger things people
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.200]  right. And HBO has already got people who love Game of Thrones,
[18:03.240 --> 18:05.760]  Game of Thrones or whatever. Yeah. So you get people who love
[18:05.760 --> 18:08.720]  shows like certain things, and you can already get them. But
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.240]  how do you expand and get a new audience and maybe the audience
[18:12.240 --> 18:15.600]  who just wants to watch the game of the week of baseball is
[18:15.600 --> 18:18.400]  different than the sort of people who watch shows like Ted
[18:18.400 --> 18:22.040]  lasso and severance on already have Apple TV. But it's so funny
[18:22.040 --> 18:26.560]  because I wanted to ask you about this, but we just got we
[18:26.560 --> 18:29.400]  just got a thing in the mail today. It's like a postcard from
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.880]  Amazon and was addressed to my wife to Amy and just says how to
[18:33.880 --> 18:39.320]  watch Thursday Night Football on the wall. And it says, so step
[18:39.320 --> 18:42.960]  one, open or download the prime video app on your TV, computer,
[18:42.960 --> 18:46.200]  phone or streaming service. Sign in with your Amazon Prime
[18:46.200 --> 18:50.160]  account or sign up for a 30 day free trial. In the prime video
[18:50.160 --> 18:55.400]  app, select quote, Thursday Night Football. Step four, press
[18:55.400 --> 18:59.640]  watch game on. It's not hard, right? That makes sense. And I
[18:59.640 --> 19:02.240]  think people who listen to this show know what it's like to sign
[19:02.240 --> 19:05.360]  up for a new streaming service. And depending on your device,
[19:06.480 --> 19:10.560]  whether it's an app store thing for your phone or tablet, or
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.920]  your Apple TV box, or it's a go to the web and just search for
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.520]  I'm sure if you go to Amazon, Amazon's all about the football
[19:19.520 --> 19:22.040]  and of course, the Lord of the Rings show they have on but it
[19:22.040 --> 19:29.480]  is it is different than just saying go to turn on the TV to
[19:29.520 --> 19:34.120]  and go and go to go to channel 850. Yeah, no, that I mean,
[19:34.120 --> 19:36.280]  there's there's a couple extra steps. But now wait, I want to
[19:36.280 --> 19:39.360]  back up. This was addressed to Amy, I assume you you your
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.080]  family has a prime account. Yes, we do. And it Do you know is it
[19:43.080 --> 19:45.880]  under her name? I actually don't know. I'm not quite sure if
[19:45.880 --> 19:49.720]  they sent this to her because she is her account or but they
[19:49.720 --> 19:53.360]  say sign in with your Amazon prime account or sign up for a
[19:53.360 --> 19:55.920]  30. Yeah, but that could just be a catch all right. I'm not quite
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.600]  sure if she got it because she's the I don't even know I've had
[20:00.600 --> 20:03.400]  an Amazon account for so long. And we've had prime for so long
[20:03.440 --> 20:07.160]  that it's right. It's prehistoric in my brain who
[20:07.160 --> 20:10.120]  signed up for it first or who's well just because it's strange
[20:10.120 --> 20:12.760]  for that to be sent to her instead of you. Well, maybe I'll
[20:12.760 --> 20:15.400]  get mine to knowing the two of you. She doesn't care about
[20:15.400 --> 20:17.840]  football and you at least somewhat do right. And then the
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.680]  flip side of the card is the schedule where they just tell
[20:20.680 --> 20:23.520]  you all the upcoming games that are on Thursday Night Football.
[20:23.560 --> 20:25.840]  The other thing Ben and I talked about, and I do think it's an
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.160]  interesting point. But I think it's more about the Sunday
[20:29.200 --> 20:33.240]  football experience. For me streaming services make flipping
[20:33.600 --> 20:36.720]  way more difficult, right? Like if your habit when you're
[20:36.720 --> 20:40.400]  watching baseball on regular TV, is that when the commercials
[20:40.400 --> 20:44.280]  come on, you flip to another game, flip to another game or
[20:44.280 --> 20:47.280]  flip to something else, just flip to the news, just something
[20:47.280 --> 20:51.920]  so you're not watching TV. But you you don't, maybe you either
[20:51.920 --> 20:54.880]  you do or do not have a DVR where you can fall behind and
[20:54.880 --> 20:57.440]  then skip them. But a lot of times for sports fans, they
[20:57.440 --> 20:59.800]  don't want to be behind, they want to be live because you
[20:59.800 --> 21:02.480]  don't, you don't want to accidentally check Twitter when
[21:02.480 --> 21:05.560]  you're bored and find out that there's a home run coming up in
[21:05.560 --> 21:08.560]  five minutes that you didn't get to yet. But the flipping is
[21:09.040 --> 21:12.760]  instrumental to my lifetime of watching quote unquote, regular
[21:12.760 --> 21:16.960]  TV, cable TV, when I was a real little kid before, I was just
[21:16.960 --> 21:18.920]  gonna say you're young enough. I'm sorry, you're old enough
[21:18.920 --> 21:21.560]  that you didn't have a remote early on, right? Right. We did
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.440]  not have a remote control when I was a little kid. And we only
[21:24.440 --> 21:28.560]  had you were the remote control. Right. And, and I don't remember
[21:28.560 --> 21:31.360]  how old I was when we got cable, but I'm gonna say I was around
[21:31.360 --> 21:36.200]  seven or eight. So like around 1980 1981. But I certainly
[21:36.200 --> 21:41.920]  watched TV in the 70s as a wee little kid. And you literally
[21:41.920 --> 21:45.440]  had a dial. I know this really makes me sound ancient. Well,
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.800]  no, there were two dials on the TV. And the one didn't do
[21:48.800 --> 21:51.360]  anything. And I've never I still don't understand it. It's like
[21:51.360 --> 21:53.560]  these are the UHF channels. I was gonna say wasn't that for
[21:53.560 --> 21:56.520]  UHF? Yeah, but there was never anything on them. All right. We
[21:56.520 --> 21:59.160]  definitely were getting them over the air with an antenna
[21:59.160 --> 22:02.240]  that was on the roof of our house. It was fine. And I'm sure
[22:02.280 --> 22:06.000]  that to my eyes now if I looked at the way Sesame Street looked
[22:06.040 --> 22:08.680]  over the air, I'd be like, I can't believe how staticky this
[22:08.680 --> 22:12.040]  is. This is ridiculous. But you literally would just get up and
[22:12.160 --> 22:16.080]  turn a dial to change it. But I remember when we got cable, you
[22:16.080 --> 22:18.440]  know what a game changer it was and you needed I mean, it was
[22:18.440 --> 22:21.680]  like the cable box came with its own remote, right? Because it
[22:21.680 --> 22:25.480]  had at that point 2030 40 channels, right? And the TVs
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.000]  didn't get cable without the cable box, all of the it's the
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.520]  it took a while for the TV sets to get there. It wasn't like you
[22:32.520 --> 22:35.560]  needed a box just to get like the premium channels like HBO,
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.480]  you needed a cable box for everything, because your TV just
[22:39.480 --> 22:43.840]  didn't didn't crock cable. So the TV cable company would give
[22:43.840 --> 22:46.800]  you your own remote. And I remember it was pretty decent
[22:46.800 --> 22:49.360]  remote because it didn't have to do everything else. It didn't
[22:49.360 --> 22:52.120]  have to control the TV. So it was just sort of like a number
[22:52.120 --> 22:55.280]  pad and enter button and just to switch channels, right. And you
[22:55.280 --> 22:59.280]  could I think it's always been sort of the UI for lack of a
[22:59.280 --> 23:02.200]  better description, the user interface for flipping between
[23:02.200 --> 23:05.400]  the two most recent channels on most remotes is just just
[23:05.400 --> 23:08.960]  press enter without entering the number first and it'll go back.
[23:08.960 --> 23:12.600]  So you could put two games on, like on a Sunday afternoon to
[23:12.600 --> 23:15.880]  watch football, and you could have the AFC game on one channel
[23:15.880 --> 23:18.680]  and the NFC game on the other. And if you didn't particularly
[23:18.680 --> 23:20.880]  care about one game, because it's not your favorite team,
[23:20.880 --> 23:23.840]  and you're just sort of having a lazy Sunday afternoon watching
[23:23.840 --> 23:27.840]  football. What I would do is just watch till we got to a
[23:27.840 --> 23:30.760]  commercial flip to the other one. And it wasn't in a
[23:30.760 --> 23:33.160]  commercial hope it wasn't in a commercial and watch that one
[23:33.160 --> 23:36.120]  until it got to a commercial. And then if one of the games was
[23:36.120 --> 23:39.360]  a blowout, and one was exciting and close, maybe stick with that
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.560]  one, actually watch a commercial, see what happens.
[23:41.560 --> 23:44.720]  Sure. But so you're now you're thinking about streaming
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.720]  services where you're much more locked in.
[23:47.760 --> 23:51.040]  Because you're you lose your place, right? I mean, you can't
[23:51.040 --> 23:54.360]  just switch between like, if Apple, let's just say, in the
[23:54.360 --> 23:57.120]  future of Apple has a baseball game at the same time that
[23:57.120 --> 23:59.760]  Amazon has a baseball game, how do you flip between the two?
[23:59.760 --> 24:02.640]  No, you can't, because the I mean, even if you can load them
[24:02.640 --> 24:06.240]  both up in the apps, I think it'll pause or right. Yeah, I
[24:06.240 --> 24:09.880]  don't. Yeah, I think that's, I well, to me, that sounds like a
[24:09.880 --> 24:13.720]  feature for to the developers of these apps, because it means
[24:13.720 --> 24:15.200]  you're not going to flip away from them.
[24:15.240 --> 24:21.840]  Right. But it's it. It's irritating. And contrary to the
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.080]  mindset of the sports fan, in my opinion, right?
[24:25.120 --> 24:28.400]  Yeah, I'll give you that. And I support sports is something you
[24:28.400 --> 24:32.520]  don't watch 100%. At least I don't focused on, especially a
[24:32.520 --> 24:34.560]  baseball game, like I'll have in the background while I'm making
[24:34.560 --> 24:37.520]  dinner or something. Right. So yeah, flipping away from a game
[24:37.560 --> 24:40.280]  during a commercial. And if you missed the first, the next 30
[24:40.280 --> 24:42.920]  seconds of the game, whatever, it's no big deal. But yeah, with
[24:42.920 --> 24:44.720]  the streaming services just not really an option.
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.720]  And I just think that there's there's a weird consumer
[24:50.720 --> 24:57.320]  psychology play here, where if your Apple or your Amazon
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.680]  or anybody else who wants to get into sports, like if Netflix
[25:00.680 --> 25:03.800]  decides to get into sports, but it seems so far like it's Amazon
[25:03.800 --> 25:07.160]  and Apple in the US who are sort of focusing the streaming on
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.520]  sports. Yeah. You don't want to make people angry. And sports
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.160]  fans will get angry about anything like it. Like we talked
[25:14.160 --> 25:16.400]  about, people will get angry about what's home run records,
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.200]  the real home run record. But like, when the baseball
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.440]  playoffs switch, TNT now has the American League Divisional
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.000]  Series, and it used to be on ESPN. And so you just plug a
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.880]  different number, or you go to your guide on your TV, they
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.040]  usually put the channels that carry sports somewhat close to
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.320]  each other, find the one that says MLB postseason and hit, hit
[25:40.320 --> 25:42.600]  the button on that. And now you're watching it. And your
[25:42.600 --> 25:45.280]  biggest complaint might be that you don't like the announcers,
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.800]  right? Of course. But it wasn't it when you know that there's a
[25:49.800 --> 25:52.480]  playoff game on you want to watch it, you just you're going
[25:52.480 --> 25:55.360]  to find it and you just go up and down the guidebook. And
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.920]  oh, there it is. It's on it's on TBS this week. So boom, I'm
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.800]  watching it. Whereas this, this is even with these easy steps,
[26:04.840 --> 26:08.280]  go here, sign in. Or if you don't have an account, sign up
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.200]  for a 30 day free trial, and then find the thing and hit
[26:12.200 --> 26:18.160]  watch. I don't know, I feel like there's an alienation effect of
[26:18.160 --> 26:20.400]  this. Well, I mean, what what do you think they should do
[26:20.400 --> 26:22.400]  differently? I don't think there's anything they can do
[26:22.400 --> 26:25.360]  different. Yeah, that's it. I think they're right to get into
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.680]  sports. I think it's one of those disruptive ideas. This
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.880]  transition from linear cable to streaming streaming service. But
[26:33.880 --> 26:36.800]  I also the other thing I think that they really need to do.
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.720]  Here's the one thing I think they could do technically, and I
[26:39.720 --> 26:42.920]  haven't watched the Amazon's Thursday Night Football yet this
[26:42.920 --> 26:45.440]  season. I think there's only been one or two games and I've
[26:45.440 --> 26:49.480]  been busy on Thursday nights. But I do think that they should
[26:49.480 --> 26:53.600]  that they should optimize their technical stack to make it as
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.040]  much like cable as possible so that there's the least amount of
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.400]  lag. And that if you do switch to another app, or switch your
[27:02.400 --> 27:05.280]  input or something like that on your TV temporarily and come
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.840]  back to keep it going in the background, if they can, I was
[27:09.840 --> 27:12.080]  gonna say I'm not even sure if they can, I won't say that they
[27:12.080 --> 27:15.720]  can write it very well could be the the device right has the
[27:15.720 --> 27:18.360]  control over that as opposed to the app, right? Like TV, like
[27:18.360 --> 27:21.160]  even if you're watching on Apple TV, but if it's the Amazon app,
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.040]  it has to follow by the rules of the tv OS platform, right? And
[27:26.040 --> 27:29.800]  they don't just keep streaming and and when you're watching
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.120]  most stuff in a streaming app, like Game of Thrones or Stranger
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.720]  Things on Netflix or whatever else, and you switch away, you
[27:37.720 --> 27:40.840]  don't want it to keep playing, right? You want to pause, right?
[27:40.840 --> 27:43.720]  You want it to pause automatically. Whereas live
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.240]  sports are different. I feel like it's an unsolved problem.
[27:49.240 --> 27:53.080]  Computers can obviously do this, right? It's this is not
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.720]  something that can't be solved. But it's a very different. It's
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.800]  fascinating to me how different it is. Whereas, like, I'll go
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.200]  back to TBS. And sometimes they show old movies. And sometimes
[28:08.200 --> 28:14.280]  they show live sports. But the guy running the console at TBS
[28:14.280 --> 28:17.640]  headquarters just is making sure that the right thing is being
[28:17.640 --> 28:20.600]  broadcast over the cable wire at the right time. And that's it.
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.880]  And it doesn't matter to him whether it's live sports or a
[28:23.880 --> 28:26.440]  replay of Raiders of the Lost Ark or something like that.
[28:27.800 --> 28:30.280]  Whereas for the streaming services, I think they kind of
[28:30.280 --> 28:32.840]  need two different implementations. And the other
[28:32.840 --> 28:35.480]  place I'm going with this is this rumor that Apple might be
[28:35.480 --> 28:39.880]  interested in getting the NFL Sunday ticket, which is all
[28:39.880 --> 28:43.000]  about switching the whole point. Nobody buys Sunday ticket if
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.040]  they're not watching multiple games at the same time on either
[28:46.040 --> 28:49.640]  on multiple TVs, or like dividing one big TV up into four
[28:49.640 --> 28:52.840]  squares and having four games at once. And I never really
[28:52.840 --> 28:55.960]  thought about it. I don't have you have to have direct TV to
[28:55.960 --> 28:58.920]  get it at this point. I've never had that. But apparently,
[28:58.920 --> 29:01.400]  they've made it very, very easy to
[29:01.400 --> 29:05.080]  Well, well, but for something like that, they can do, you know,
[29:05.080 --> 29:11.000]  a split screen kind of thing within the app. Does the MLB
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.080]  app right now let you do two games at once?
[29:13.080 --> 29:13.960]  I don't know.
[29:13.960 --> 29:14.680]  I think it does.
[29:16.680 --> 29:19.240]  I'd have to look at this again, because I haven't paid that
[29:19.240 --> 29:22.040]  much attention to sports at all this year, because it's been
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.000]  terrible here in Boston. But the split screen stuff is really
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.880]  the way to do this is like, especially if they have Sunday
[29:27.880 --> 29:31.640]  ticket and you say, okay, in slot one, play the NFC game and
[29:31.640 --> 29:34.600]  in slot two, play the AFC game, whatever, all within the app.
[29:34.600 --> 29:37.400]  And then you're just flipping between them. The app is
[29:37.400 --> 29:39.720]  controlling it. I guess at that point, you know, you couldn't
[29:39.720 --> 29:43.320]  do that in a browser as easily. But there's at least ways to
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.880]  solve it for one thing like that, for within just within the
[29:47.880 --> 29:50.360]  app. Because, again, for several years, they've done March
[29:50.360 --> 29:54.120]  Madness, like CBS, the CBS app has had some sort of split
[29:54.120 --> 29:56.440]  screen where you could be watching multiple NCAA
[29:56.440 --> 29:59.400]  basketball games at once. That's like the perfect example
[29:59.400 --> 30:01.160]  of when you want to switch because you don't care about any
[30:01.160 --> 30:01.800]  of these teams.
[30:01.800 --> 30:04.120]  Yeah, just show me one where it's a one point lead.
[30:04.120 --> 30:06.920]  Where it's close or like where my seed is going to win
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.640]  whatever. And that I think has been the solution is just
[30:09.640 --> 30:10.280]  split screen.
[30:11.480 --> 30:14.040]  Yeah. And I would say that I'm glad you mentioned it because
[30:14.040 --> 30:17.320]  I've been a typical March Madness fan who doesn't really
[30:17.320 --> 30:19.800]  watch that much. I used to watch tons of college basketball
[30:19.800 --> 30:24.120]  when I was a young man with seemingly infinite time on my
[30:24.120 --> 30:27.000]  hands. But yeah, I've used that app for years. And I have to
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.680]  say it is actually a very good app.
[30:29.240 --> 30:31.480]  Right. That's what I remember from using it was that it worked
[30:31.480 --> 30:33.560]  the way you're describing of being able to flip between
[30:33.560 --> 30:35.080]  things and focus on the one that you want.
[30:35.800 --> 30:39.800]  The last thing I'll touch on is with the Apple TV Plus. With
[30:39.800 --> 30:42.680]  Amazon Prime, I think the deal is a little bit more clear.
[30:43.400 --> 30:47.240]  I wonder how much of a problem it is for Apple that the...
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.080]  Do I have to pay for this question is so ambiguous for
[30:53.080 --> 30:54.120]  Apple TV?
[30:54.120 --> 30:57.000]  I was going to ask you for the... Has the baseball been free
[30:57.000 --> 30:57.480]  all year?
[30:57.480 --> 30:59.000]  I believe it has been free all year.
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.520]  I thought so. It was initially they said free through June or
[31:02.520 --> 31:04.920]  July, whatever. And then it was a question of whether they
[31:04.920 --> 31:06.920]  were going to start charging or next year they'll start
[31:06.920 --> 31:09.480]  charging, whatever. But I think that's correct that these
[31:09.480 --> 31:12.280]  games are all free. So anyone who was saying like, oh, I want
[31:12.280 --> 31:14.520]  to watch this game and they should give it back to yes. All
[31:14.520 --> 31:17.560]  they had to do was go to, I don't even know, but Apple TV
[31:17.560 --> 31:20.760]  dot com and they don't even need to pay for it.
[31:21.320 --> 31:24.440]  Right. I believe you probably can go to Apple TV dot com. I
[31:24.440 --> 31:28.520]  think you can also go to TV dot Apple com. But I think people
[31:28.520 --> 31:33.320]  have it in their head. Yeah. If you go to Apple TV dot com, it
[31:33.320 --> 31:36.760]  redirects you somewhere with all of them. They're trying to
[31:36.760 --> 31:40.040]  sell you stuff. All of Apple's various things called Apple TV,
[31:40.680 --> 31:47.000]  Apple TV, 4k, Apple TV, HD, Apple TV app, Apple TV plus.
[31:47.640 --> 31:51.240]  And then I guess TV dot Apple dot com gets you to Apple TV
[31:51.240 --> 31:53.160]  plus, which is their streaming service.
[31:53.160 --> 31:56.040]  Right. I just wonder though, how much of it is in the back of
[31:56.040 --> 31:58.440]  people's heads where this is where they're going to get me.
[31:58.440 --> 32:01.640]  Right. And people are rightfully, I'd like to come
[32:01.640 --> 32:04.360]  back with this at the end of the show, talking about rogue amoeba
[32:04.360 --> 32:07.720]  and subscriptions, subscription fatigue is a real thing, right?
[32:07.720 --> 32:12.360]  Like it is a huge thing. It's, it's been a shift for content
[32:12.360 --> 32:16.680]  that you consume. It has been a shift in the software industry.
[32:16.680 --> 32:19.480]  So for people who actually pay for their professional software
[32:19.480 --> 32:23.000]  tools, it's at some level, it'd be very surprising to find
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.120]  anybody who's considered themselves a computer professional
[32:26.120 --> 32:30.040]  who doesn't subscribe to some kind of some service service or
[32:30.040 --> 32:37.560]  app or something like that. And it people realize, and they're
[32:37.560 --> 32:40.840]  right. I think that this is one of those cases where the person
[32:40.840 --> 32:44.040]  on the streets attitude is right, where you kind of do want
[32:44.040 --> 32:46.920]  to, Hey, every couple months, you should like, just take a
[32:46.920 --> 32:49.400]  look at your credit card bill and look at every single monthly
[32:49.400 --> 32:53.560]  subscription that's on there. And maybe circle a couple of
[32:53.560 --> 32:56.120]  them that that you haven't watched in a while. Like I
[32:56.120 --> 32:58.920]  don't, has anybody watched anything on Hulu in months? I
[32:58.920 --> 33:02.680]  don't know. It's easier to cancel than, than cable TV was
[33:02.680 --> 33:05.320]  back in the day where you don't used to have to drive down to a
[33:05.320 --> 33:08.280]  sketchy part of town and take your equipment in and where
[33:08.280 --> 33:10.280]  they were at least at least around here, they had
[33:10.280 --> 33:15.240]  bulletproof glass, which always amused me now. Now Xfinity has
[33:15.240 --> 33:18.360]  their like cell phone looking stores. But back in the early
[33:18.360 --> 33:21.240]  2000s, they had bulletproof glass. And I always joked that
[33:21.240 --> 33:24.600]  even the DMV doesn't have bulletproof glass, which is how
[33:24.600 --> 33:27.000]  much we hated our cable company. Because there were times too,
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.360]  where I had to move like when I moved up to Massachusetts and
[33:30.360 --> 33:33.800]  for two years back 20 years ago, I had to get new cable
[33:33.800 --> 33:36.040]  service. So I wasn't just moving across town in
[33:36.040 --> 33:38.600]  Philadelphia, and I could take my cable box, I had to go down
[33:38.600 --> 33:41.400]  there and so you had to return one and then you had to go pick
[33:41.400 --> 33:45.240]  up another one right at another place, which was also full of
[33:45.240 --> 33:48.280]  bulletproof glass. And one of those, what do you even call
[33:48.280 --> 33:51.560]  it, like a lazy Susan? Well, where they can rotate, you can
[33:51.560 --> 33:54.040]  put down your box and then they can rotate it under the glass.
[33:54.040 --> 33:56.360]  Right, but that it was still a protective layer of
[33:56.360 --> 33:59.000]  bulletproof glass between them at all times.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.800]  Basically is like a lazy, like you see that at really bad
[34:01.800 --> 34:03.880]  convenience stores and at the cable company.
[34:05.480 --> 34:08.360]  But you know, and they talk about it in the streaming world
[34:08.360 --> 34:11.640]  churn, right? That people, they'll watch their face and
[34:11.640 --> 34:15.480]  that maybe this has come back to bite Netflix now that the
[34:15.480 --> 34:19.320]  overall world is way more competitive and that Netflix is,
[34:19.320 --> 34:25.880]  hey, we don't suffer. Churn was hubris fueled by the era where
[34:25.880 --> 34:29.400]  Netflix was so dominant and then and yeah, there weren't so
[34:29.400 --> 34:32.120]  many other options, right? And now that there's Disney plus
[34:32.120 --> 34:35.480]  and HBO has a very good service and people are like, you know
[34:35.480 --> 34:38.200]  what? I'm done with Stranger Things and they thank you,
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.160]  Netflix for releasing it all at the same time all at once.
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.000]  Yeah. So I watched the whole season in 10 days and now I'll
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.560]  just turn off my Netflix subscription until you come out
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.960]  with something else I want to watch. It's just a different
[34:51.960 --> 34:54.120]  mindset to me. Anyway, I thought it was interesting. I
[34:54.120 --> 34:57.240]  thought the play on sports gave us an excuse to nerd out on
[34:57.240 --> 34:57.720]  sports.
[34:57.720 --> 35:02.280]  Sure, absolutely. Rogers Hornsby was 424 in 1924.
[35:02.280 --> 35:05.800]  Okay. So you had the you had the you had the it matched the
[35:05.800 --> 35:07.880]  year, but it was it was four years later than you thought.
[35:07.880 --> 35:08.200]  Thank you.
[35:08.200 --> 35:11.320]  And he was not the MVP that year. No, who was not sure who
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.080]  was that? Let's see if I can Dazie Vance, who I've never heard
[35:15.080 --> 35:20.440]  of never nor nor have I but you guys a pitcher 262 strikeouts.
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.880]  Okay, you have to admit great baseball name. It's true. It's
[35:23.880 --> 35:27.320]  true. All right, let me speaking of commercials and not skipping
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.800]  don't skip this one. I want to tell you about our good friends
[35:29.800 --> 35:33.800]  at ship station. Now I love this company because they've got in
[35:33.800 --> 35:36.840]  my opinion, the best slogan of any sponsor of this podcast
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.040]  ever, whether you're starting small or scaling up ship station
[35:40.040 --> 35:44.520]  makes ship happen. I like it. I like it. I love it, but I'm
[35:44.520 --> 35:48.040]  always worried that I've got to botch it. I mean, you're not
[35:48.040 --> 35:51.400]  doing the show live. I guess we could don't let them be a live
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.960]  sponsor. Well, ship station helps you ship products. It's
[35:55.960 --> 35:58.840]  that simple. And they set you up for growth by directly
[35:58.840 --> 36:01.640]  integrating with every shopping cart and storefront. So your
[36:01.640 --> 36:04.360]  products are easier to find easier to manage easier to get
[36:04.360 --> 36:07.560]  into the hands of your happy customers. Don't wait until
[36:07.560 --> 36:10.360]  you're drowning in orders to find the right shipping solution
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.160]  upgrade to ship station today. So you don't have to limit your
[36:15.160 --> 36:17.560]  business to one store. They integrate with everything
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.160]  Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Shopify, et cetera. So if you sell your
[36:21.160 --> 36:24.440]  products, if you ship stuff from a diverse number of platforms,
[36:24.440 --> 36:28.440]  you can integrate it all through ship station with minimal
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.880]  effort. You can compare carriers rates and delivery times to get
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.400]  the most out of every package you send and you get the same
[36:35.400 --> 36:38.760]  discounted shipping rates as fortune 500 companies, whether
[36:38.760 --> 36:41.960]  you're sending just a stack or a whole truck full of products
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.080]  because ship station let you the small business piggyback on
[36:47.080 --> 36:51.240]  them as a major, major shipping producer. So they get these
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.760]  bulk rates that you yourself would never get directly from
[36:54.760 --> 37:00.120]  the individual carriers. You can join over 130,000 companies who
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.520]  have grown their e-commerce businesses with ship station.
[37:02.520 --> 37:06.280]  98% of companies that use ship station for one year become
[37:06.280 --> 37:10.680]  customers for life. That's really impressive memory. So

[37:43.320 --> 37:47.160]  you get the iPhone 14? I've got it. I got the pro right in
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.000]  front of me. Which color did you get? What is the who's at the
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.400]  deep purple? Deep purple. But it's in a case. So I got myself
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.120]  a nice I usually get like a gray or a black case and I got
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.920]  myself a nice blue case. And that's so to me, this phone is
[38:00.920 --> 38:03.720]  blue. Last year's phone was blue in a black case. So I never
[38:03.720 --> 38:06.600]  saw the blues. It occurs to me for the first time. I didn't
[38:06.600 --> 38:10.120]  put it in my review, but it occurred to me. And it's very
[38:10.120 --> 38:12.680]  obvious. And I guess I'd thought of it, but I just had
[38:12.680 --> 38:16.840]  never thought about this. The obviousness of it that what
[38:16.840 --> 38:20.600]  Apple does with these with the iPhones every year is they come
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.080]  out with limited edition colors. They don't call them
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.800]  limited edition colors. But if tradition serves, it doesn't
[38:27.800 --> 38:31.080]  matter how popular deep purple is. It won't be there next year.
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.040]  It won't be there next year. It wasn't there last year. And no
[38:34.040 --> 38:37.000]  matter how much you liked the I forget what they called the
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.520]  blue one last year. Was it Pacific blue? Yeah, something
[38:40.520 --> 38:43.400]  like that. And then there was a green one a couple of years ago
[38:43.400 --> 38:46.680]  that was that was sort of like a Boba Fett colored green sort
[38:46.680 --> 38:50.600]  of they're all as I joked in my review. And as my wife, Amy,
[38:50.600 --> 38:53.320]  put in her entire iPhone review, which she tweeted out.
[38:54.600 --> 38:57.000]  They're all just different colors of gray. That's it.
[38:57.000 --> 39:02.840]  That's the review. Sierra blue, Sierra Sierra blue. But it is
[39:02.840 --> 39:05.240]  interesting. I never really thought about them as they don't
[39:05.240 --> 39:08.120]  call them limited edition colors, but they clearly are.
[39:08.120 --> 39:12.840]  And what I guess clarified it for me is I sort of really gave
[39:12.840 --> 39:17.160]  it an extra thought this year in my review about the fact that
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.520]  the iPhone 14 Pro models don't stick around for additional
[39:22.520 --> 39:25.240]  years. So it's not just that they're not going to come out
[39:25.240 --> 39:30.360]  with an iPhone 15 in deep purple next year. The that you
[39:30.360 --> 39:33.800]  won't be able to even buy this one, right? The 14 pros go away
[39:33.800 --> 39:39.720]  and it's it's somehow it it snuck up on me over the years
[39:39.720 --> 39:42.680]  because in the early years of the iPhone, that was what they
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.400]  did is they would keep the three G when the three GS came
[39:47.400 --> 39:51.240]  out, sell it at a lower rate and then keep the three GS at a
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.440]  lower price when the iPhone four come out, so on and so
[39:54.440 --> 39:57.480]  forth with one new iPhone per year and the older ones
[39:57.480 --> 40:02.040]  sticking around. And they still do that with the non pro ones,
[40:02.040 --> 40:04.120]  right? You could still buy I believe I think they're still
[40:04.120 --> 40:07.080]  selling the iPhone 11 or maybe they've gone up to 12. But I
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.200]  think but you can go but even though Apple might not list the
[40:10.200 --> 40:14.280]  iPhone 11, you can go to like Verizon or AT&T and still buy
[40:14.280 --> 40:18.120]  still get one. Yeah, but you can't buy the iPhone 13 Pro
[40:18.120 --> 40:21.240]  anymore. Now there might be stock in the in the channel or
[40:21.240 --> 40:23.480]  something like that. But at this point, not for long, not for
[40:23.480 --> 40:28.760]  long. They so that's it's interesting to me from at a
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.200]  consumer level that no matter how popular a color is, that's
[40:32.200 --> 40:35.400]  it. This is your one chance and only to get it. Well, I guess
[40:35.400 --> 40:37.960]  the I guess the question is, is that true? I mean, yes, it's
[40:37.960 --> 40:40.120]  been true with this green with the blue and probably with the
[40:40.120 --> 40:43.480]  purple. But like if they had one that suddenly that was the one
[40:43.480 --> 40:46.200]  that sold so much more Do you think? I mean, I don't think
[40:46.200 --> 40:49.640]  that they would be reluctant to keep the color around if they
[40:49.640 --> 40:52.040]  discovered a color that that people loved. I think they'd
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.320]  probably keep it around. Yeah, and that's probably the sort of
[40:55.320 --> 41:01.720]  thing that they could do on relatively short notice, right?
[41:01.720 --> 41:05.080]  Like most I like to, and I've heard this from so many people
[41:05.080 --> 41:08.040]  at Apple, but most of the hardware decisions in like a new
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.960]  iPhone were made a year or two, two or two years ago, at least
[41:11.960 --> 41:15.160]  that much, if not more, right? No, no. But john, I read these
[41:15.160 --> 41:18.760]  rumor sites. And I hear that Apple at the last second decided
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.400]  to drop the fourth camera on the on the new iPhone. Yeah, that
[41:23.400 --> 41:26.280]  doesn't happen. But I would imagine that that ad saying we
[41:26.280 --> 41:29.000]  should go back, we should keep the purple for a second year is
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.960]  something that they could decide to actually do. Right. And they
[41:31.960 --> 41:35.400]  could probably if it's if it is going to be that popular, they
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.080]  probably know it already from the initial sales, they could
[41:39.080 --> 41:43.560]  already get the gears turning to coat the steel bands with the
[41:43.560 --> 41:48.200]  deep purple and produce more of the deep purple back glass.
[41:48.200 --> 41:50.120]  Well, wait, so there's an interesting question briefly,
[41:50.120 --> 41:52.200]  though, if let's say the hardware decisions for the
[41:52.200 --> 41:56.200]  iPhone 16 Pro are already made or about to be made, but when
[41:56.200 --> 41:59.880]  does next year's phone the 15 Pro, when does production on
[41:59.880 --> 42:03.400]  that actually start? That's like a month or two, right? Yeah,
[42:03.400 --> 42:06.680]  because because high level production seems like something
[42:06.680 --> 42:10.680]  that really only gears up right at the very end. Yes. And I
[42:10.680 --> 42:13.720]  would think that the colors would be much closer to that
[42:13.720 --> 42:16.520]  than to putting another camera or whatever. Yeah, so I don't
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.760]  know, it might be too late. It really might even the color.
[42:18.760 --> 42:21.080]  No, no, I'm saying I think they've got enough time. Yeah,
[42:21.080 --> 42:23.560]  I'm saying with you that that in in June of next year, that's
[42:23.560 --> 42:26.200]  when they need to say these are the colors. Yeah, probably I
[42:26.200 --> 42:30.120]  would bet because and I'm sure they do testing with the actual
[42:30.120 --> 42:34.520]  colors to get them to come out right. And then it it must be
[42:34.520 --> 42:37.080]  so fast. It's like one of the great secrets of the whole
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.600]  Apple world that they just deliberately don't ever shine a
[42:40.600 --> 42:46.600]  light on is how many engineers at Apple and designers are
[42:46.600 --> 42:50.840]  spending so much time so long in advance just to make sure
[42:50.840 --> 42:54.760]  that the deep purple steel looks the right color issue,
[42:54.760 --> 42:57.080]  right? And then there's somebody else. I don't know. It could
[42:57.080 --> 42:59.480]  be. It might be this one person does all the colors. I don't
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.680]  know. But maybe there's somebody else who's in charge of making
[43:02.680 --> 43:05.880]  sure space black is as black as we think it's going to be,
[43:06.440 --> 43:09.800]  along with all of the other engineering issues of Okay, this
[43:09.800 --> 43:12.440]  seems right. These things are passing their quality tests.
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.680]  And then somebody over there is like, and they're like, Okay, so
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.120]  we're gonna say go and you're gonna start making like, 3
[43:20.120 --> 43:23.160]  million of these a week. And they're like, Yeah, yes. Yes,
[43:23.160 --> 43:26.840]  the purple will work. Well, and and as you said, they've
[43:26.840 --> 43:29.640]  changed every year. So that I mean, maybe the process is not
[43:30.280 --> 43:32.600]  as complicated as we think, or maybe changing the color is
[43:32.600 --> 43:35.720]  not that complicated. But yeah, they they have not stuck with
[43:35.720 --> 43:39.400]  one. So they're obviously doing well in terms of well, because
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.080]  because what what phone was it that the white took forever and
[43:43.080 --> 43:47.000]  then wasn't very good? And was that the five or what? No, I
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.920]  forget or, or was it the four? I think might have been the
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.160]  iPhone four. The white iPhone four was was where they did
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.960]  they announce it on day one, but yes, coming next year, and
[43:57.960 --> 43:59.560]  then next year took forever.
[44:00.920 --> 44:03.640]  Yeah, I think what happened in the iPhone
[44:05.880 --> 44:10.360]  four was the last one that was introduced in June, and was the
[44:10.360 --> 44:14.440]  antenna gate phone. And they announced it probably at WWDC.
[44:15.080 --> 44:18.920]  And Steve Jobs did the introduction was one of the last
[44:18.920 --> 44:21.720]  phones might have been the last phone he introduced.
[44:21.720 --> 44:24.680]  Yeah, it was the four and it was 2011. So yeah, yeah.
[44:24.680 --> 44:29.960]  And it was a weird it was the most unusual cycle in all of
[44:29.960 --> 44:32.840]  iPhone history, because it was the one where they decided we're
[44:32.840 --> 44:36.680]  going to shift it to the fall. But they also came off off cycle
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.200]  with the Verizon Verizon iPhone, right, which was like
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.360]  February of the next year. And then I think the white iPhone
[44:44.360 --> 44:47.800]  fours started actually shipping in like May.
[44:48.440 --> 44:50.920]  You know, I'm sorry, I just I just pulled this up. So June was
[44:50.920 --> 44:52.840]  when they introduced the four, they said, we're gonna have
[44:52.840 --> 44:57.480]  black and white. And the white just did not show up until April
[44:57.480 --> 45:00.840]  of 2011. The end of April. Right.
[45:00.840 --> 45:03.640]  Which so like that, like something obviously got screwed
[45:03.640 --> 45:05.640]  up internally for that to happen.
[45:06.200 --> 45:12.280]  Yeah. And I remember being, I think, at the antenna gate event.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.600]  Which would have been earlier than this.
[45:14.600 --> 45:15.480]  Oh, way earlier.
[45:15.480 --> 45:16.520]  Yeah, much earlier.
[45:16.520 --> 45:19.800]  But it was still at a time where Apple was sort of mum on
[45:19.800 --> 45:22.440]  the fact that white hadn't shipped. And I believe it was a
[45:22.440 --> 45:27.720]  source of marital stress in my household. Because because
[45:27.720 --> 45:31.320]  we've always been everybody gets a new iPhone every year,
[45:31.320 --> 45:34.680]  we'll trade the old one in or I keep them on a shelf and Amy
[45:34.680 --> 45:37.320]  trades them in, but she wanted to get the white one. So she
[45:37.320 --> 45:40.840]  ordered the white one, but so she never didn't come. I mean,
[45:40.840 --> 45:43.720]  I did. It wasn't like they held her money. It was like,
[45:44.440 --> 45:46.120]  she was planning on it, because I don't even think you can
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.600]  order it. I think it was just, it just didn't exist. Yeah,
[45:48.600 --> 45:51.240]  it just didn't exist. But I remember when I went out to
[45:51.240 --> 45:56.520]  Cupertino to the old town hall, band box auditorium. I mean,
[45:56.520 --> 45:59.960]  it's being generous calling it an auditorium, but and being
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.280]  on campus and seeing Apple employees walking around with
[46:04.280 --> 46:04.840]  white iPhone.
[46:04.840 --> 46:06.120]  Oh, they had the white ones?
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.760]  Yeah, it was like, Whoa, what the hell? I was like, Oh, we're
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.680]  at Apple. So yes, there are people, there were people at
[46:12.680 --> 46:15.400]  Apple who had them, but they were not on sale. I don't think
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.000]  we ever got a straight answer, of course, because Apple
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.520]  doesn't want to explain what was clearly an embarrassing
[46:23.560 --> 46:26.360]  radical issue with the production of the way I forget
[46:26.360 --> 46:30.280]  what it was, or what the rumors were, if it was like that,
[46:30.280 --> 46:34.760]  that in production, it was yellowing, or if it was somehow
[46:34.760 --> 46:37.960]  the white back cracked easier or something, because that was
[46:37.960 --> 46:40.520]  when the first one that had a glass back. So it wasn't
[46:40.520 --> 46:42.920]  plastic. If it had been plastic, I'm sure it would have been
[46:42.920 --> 46:45.800]  no issue. But something about making the white plastic was
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.440]  or the white glass was a hold up. Very strange. Well, the
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.080]  other thing I wanted to say, though, and I do find all this
[46:53.080 --> 46:56.040]  talk about color. It's obviously the color of the iPhones
[46:56.040 --> 46:59.480]  is always featured in the ads, the billboards. I think
[46:59.480 --> 47:02.600]  they've made commercials to mention the color of the year,
[47:02.600 --> 47:06.760]  like Deep Purple this year. And what do 98% of people do as
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.200]  soon as they get their iPhone? Put it in a case. Do you think
[47:10.200 --> 47:13.240]  I'm right? What percentage of iPhone users do you believe?
[47:13.240 --> 47:16.840]  Yeah, we've talked about this, like, I don't know. Yeah, I
[47:16.840 --> 47:20.280]  don't know a number, but certainly more than 75%. And I
[47:20.280 --> 47:24.840]  would not be surprised if it's over 90, 95, close to 98%. It's
[47:24.840 --> 47:29.080]  the vast, vast majority. And my sort of trivia question for
[47:29.080 --> 47:32.040]  people or thinking question for people is, can you think of
[47:32.040 --> 47:35.960]  another product that you buy, and then immediately sort of
[47:35.960 --> 47:40.200]  transform? Like, I mean, it speaks to the, as durable as
[47:40.200 --> 47:42.280]  modern smartphones are, it speaks to the lack of
[47:42.280 --> 47:45.560]  durability. Like, Apple could design a phone that did not
[47:45.560 --> 47:48.360]  require a case. Like, most people don't put a case on their
[47:48.360 --> 47:51.240]  Apple Watch and their Apple Watch Ultra, which is designed
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.720]  to take hammer blows. But the phone is still left fragile
[47:55.720 --> 47:59.960]  enough that everyone puts a case on it. And I can't think
[47:59.960 --> 48:02.440]  of another product like that than besides smartphones, not
[48:02.440 --> 48:04.920]  just the iPhone. I think it's most smartphones. And I think
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.360]  at this point, it's too ingrained. I think that they
[48:08.360 --> 48:09.880]  really could. Right, like, I don't even know that I really
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.960]  need this case as much. Yeah, and they've, over the summer,
[48:13.960 --> 48:16.600]  they had an ad campaign. Actually, I think it was for the
[48:16.600 --> 48:19.560]  watch. But it was curious because there were rumors that
[48:19.560 --> 48:22.280]  what we now know is the Ultra was coming out, but Apple made
[48:22.280 --> 48:24.840]  a commercial over the summer for the Series 7 regular
[48:24.840 --> 48:29.160]  watches, showing them getting hit with soccer balls and other
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.560]  action type sports and swimming and just sort of emphasize
[48:33.560 --> 48:36.200]  like, hey, your Apple Watch, you can actually wear it. It's
[48:36.200 --> 48:39.240]  tough. It can handle this. Yeah, I see a fair number of
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.680]  people, though, with I don't know if you'd call it some kind
[48:42.680 --> 48:45.640]  of wrapper on their Apple Watch. Of course, there definitely
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.680]  are buffers. And there are cases for them. But I it's not.
[48:48.680 --> 48:51.720]  I don't know what percentage, but it's way, way, way lower
[48:51.720 --> 48:54.360]  than phones and way lower than if it's double digits, I'd be
[48:54.360 --> 48:57.160]  surprised. I think I think I almost exclusively see naked
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.680]  Apple Watches. And I almost exclusively see cased phones,
[49:00.680 --> 49:04.200]  right? And you do see people like there are cases for iPads,
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.960]  but tip, I typically only see them or notice them for
[49:07.960 --> 49:11.880]  children for the obvious, like an actual like, like hard case,
[49:11.880 --> 49:15.080]  right, like a hard case. And otherwise, with iPads, people
[49:15.080 --> 49:18.600]  just buy the magnetic covers, and they sort of, there's a
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.240]  little bit of protection there. And yeah, yeah, like the cover
[49:21.240 --> 49:24.680]  gives you scratch protection, which is what I care most about
[49:24.680 --> 49:26.680]  with an iPad, because I'm just at some point, I'm going to put
[49:26.680 --> 49:29.240]  it in a bag and carry it around with other stuff. And I don't
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.960]  want the glass getting scratched. But you don't really
[49:31.960 --> 49:35.400]  need a case. And there are other products like you could, I
[49:35.400 --> 49:38.520]  guess somebody maybe for like the education market, there are
[49:38.520 --> 49:44.760]  cases for Mac books. I don't know it. But I at this point, I
[49:44.760 --> 49:48.200]  don't know what they could do with the phone. I think that
[49:48.200 --> 49:51.880]  they could, they could just beg people, they could make it an
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.960]  entire hour of the September event next year, emphasizing how
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.040]  durable the new iPhone 15 Pro is, and that you can hit it with
[50:00.040 --> 50:03.160]  a hockey puck, and you can drop it and you could do this and you
[50:03.160 --> 50:06.200]  could do that and it won't scratch. And I think everybody
[50:06.200 --> 50:08.840]  would just nod their head and then they'd buy a case and then
[50:08.840 --> 50:09.480]  go buy a case.
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.040]  I don't know. I mean, I agree. I think it like it's very
[50:14.040 --> 50:17.160]  ingrained. And I didn't wait to get the phone to get a case. I
[50:17.160 --> 50:20.760]  got a case and came the same day the phone did. But if they, I
[50:20.760 --> 50:25.160]  don't know, if they talked up the display being so
[50:25.160 --> 50:29.640]  shatterproof, the same way like the Ultra Watch is, I might at
[50:29.640 --> 50:30.920]  least be willing to consider it.
[50:30.920 --> 50:34.600]  Yeah, and I'd like to not need a case or not feel like I need a
[50:34.600 --> 50:35.080]  case.
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.480]  I actually I don't even remember what happened. I
[50:37.480 --> 50:43.560]  actually it was on the trip to Cupertino to go to the event
[50:44.200 --> 50:49.400]  earlier this month. And somehow I noticed that the back of my
[50:49.400 --> 50:52.920]  personal iPhone 13 Pro, the back had now had a crack in the
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.520]  corner. And I didn't remember dropping my phone. I don't know
[50:56.520 --> 50:58.840]  when it happened. And it's like somehow my phone knows.
[50:58.840 --> 51:00.760]  Knows that I'm here to pick up a review.
[51:01.400 --> 51:03.400]  You're getting a brand new phone. So whatever.
[51:03.400 --> 51:06.360]  Right. And it like spitefully cracked itself or something. But
[51:06.360 --> 51:06.840]  it was on the back.
[51:06.840 --> 51:09.320]  Well, that was that's that's what I've always thought about
[51:09.320 --> 51:12.920]  Apple executives. You famously asked if if any of them used a
[51:12.920 --> 51:16.120]  case and they all held up their phones naked. Right. And it's
[51:16.120 --> 51:19.080]  like, great, you've got a barrel of iPhones, you can just grab a
[51:19.080 --> 51:23.320]  brand new one. The average person and honestly, the repairs
[51:23.320 --> 51:26.920]  on it are not terribly bad for like getting I think you've done
[51:26.920 --> 51:30.760]  it once or twice. Right. You've three times repaired. Yeah. And
[51:30.760 --> 51:31.960]  it's what like 50 bucks?
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.240]  Oh, no, it varies. It's okay. And apparently the back is
[51:37.240 --> 51:40.120]  actually super expensive. This is put it this ties into the
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.640]  news that came out last week from I fix it teardown that the
[51:43.640 --> 51:48.760]  regular non pro iPhone 14 have an all new internal engineering
[51:48.760 --> 51:53.160]  design. That's easier to repair, right? Because there's, there's
[51:53.160 --> 51:57.000]  two ways to get to it, right? Oh, you can you could get to if
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.240]  you just need to fix the screen, you could take off the screen.
[51:59.240 --> 52:02.280]  Whereas I believe it's the case that for the last few years,
[52:03.400 --> 52:06.360]  the only way to get anywhere is to go through the screen. And so
[52:06.360 --> 52:10.520]  if like your camera's broken, or the back glass is broken so bad,
[52:10.520 --> 52:14.200]  you want to get it fixed. It literally has to be almost
[52:14.200 --> 52:18.360]  completely disassembled. And I say it's like a $500 or $400
[52:18.360 --> 52:21.480]  repair for like the pro model. It's shockingly close to half
[52:21.480 --> 52:25.960]  the price of the phone. Whereas the display is cheaper, but the
[52:25.960 --> 52:28.120]  display is not that much cheaper because they're expensive
[52:28.120 --> 52:30.680]  displays, especially if you get the pro model, but that's a big
[52:30.680 --> 52:35.880]  change for the non pro iPhone 14. But the pros still have the
[52:35.880 --> 52:39.960]  same repairability issues now. So I don't buy. I don't typically
[52:39.960 --> 52:42.600]  use a case I buy a couple cases a year. Last year I went
[52:42.600 --> 52:45.800]  overboard I bought I bought way too many cases for somebody who
[52:45.800 --> 52:49.000]  doesn't use a case. And I had it in my head that it was
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.040]  justified because I would either write a big article talking
[52:52.040 --> 52:55.080]  about here's my favorite as a non case iPhone person who
[52:55.080 --> 52:59.880]  occasionally uses one like on vacation to get a better grip in
[52:59.880 --> 53:03.960]  a like a Disney World or something like that. And it
[53:03.960 --> 53:07.480]  might be rainy might be slippery. I want to put my phone
[53:07.480 --> 53:10.760]  in a case to give it more grip. Anyway, it's just all very
[53:10.760 --> 53:13.720]  unusual to me that we obsess about these iPhone colors Apple
[53:13.720 --> 53:16.040]  clearly obsesses about them, they make them the focus of
[53:16.040 --> 53:21.240]  their marketing campaigns and billboards. And I think it's the
[53:21.240 --> 53:25.160]  reason why people so many people seemingly 95% of people
[53:25.160 --> 53:28.680]  instantly put their brand new iPhones into a case as soon as
[53:28.680 --> 53:32.280]  they get them is they want to protect them. Because they like
[53:32.280 --> 53:36.040]  the way they look naked, but never actually enjoy it. And
[53:36.040 --> 53:40.120]  it's it. I mean, you get to see it. I until they till they take
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.680]  it out of the case when they send it back when they get a
[53:42.680 --> 53:46.120]  trade in in a two years or three years. And look how nice it
[53:46.120 --> 53:49.560]  looks that right. I just find it endlessly fascinating that
[53:49.560 --> 53:53.800]  people care about the color and the case and the condition of
[53:53.800 --> 53:55.880]  their iPhone but never actually enjoy it.
[53:57.080 --> 53:59.320]  Well, but that's so you asked what color I got, I got the
[53:59.320 --> 54:01.560]  purple because I thought if I don't like it, I'm not gonna see
[54:01.560 --> 54:04.440]  it. And if I do like it, well, I'm not gonna see it. So I don't
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.440]  know, you do see it through the buttons, though, because you
[54:06.440 --> 54:09.880]  like to buy a case where the buttons, the case doesn't have
[54:09.880 --> 54:13.320]  buttons, you actually poke that's right, that's right. So
[54:13.320 --> 54:15.400]  you do get to see your deep purple buttons.
[54:16.280 --> 54:19.400]  I do see some buttons, they mostly look gray, Amy is
[54:19.400 --> 54:24.040]  correct. Looking at the cameras on the back, there's like a hint
[54:24.040 --> 54:27.960]  of purple, it's mostly gray. The other thing I also find
[54:27.960 --> 54:31.000]  interesting, I probably say this every year, too, is that I
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.280]  do find it interesting to that I see almost nobody with Apple
[54:34.280 --> 54:39.880]  branded cases. You see, I see, I see a decent amount of those,
[54:39.880 --> 54:43.400]  I shouldn't say none. But I you don't, you don't see that many,
[54:43.400 --> 54:47.640]  in my opinion. I don't know. I don't know if I mean, there's
[54:47.640 --> 54:51.080]  there are so many cases, the Apple ones are fairly expensive,
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.880]  you can get a cheaper case, right that if you don't care
[54:53.880 --> 54:57.320]  that much about the aesthetics, a $20 case is just as good as
[54:57.320 --> 55:00.120]  a $50 case, it might even be better in terms of protection.
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.600]  So yeah, I feel like those cases are sold, they're certainly
[55:04.600 --> 55:07.800]  sold at a premium, an Apple premium. And so yeah, I'm not
[55:07.800 --> 55:09.160]  surprised they're not super popular.
[55:10.680 --> 55:14.680]  Well, it's just endlessly fascinating, as I said. All
[55:14.680 --> 55:17.240]  right, let me take another break here and thank our next
[55:17.240 --> 55:21.000]  friend of the show. It's our good friends at Linode. Linode,
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.160]  that's where I host Staring Fireball, they've got a new
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.440]  product release, they call it, it's their their database
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.120]  product. You can go to linode.com slash products
[55:30.120 --> 55:35.400]  databases and find out more. They've got MySQL, MongoDB,
[55:35.400 --> 55:38.360]  PostgresQL. I think I'm pronouncing that right.
[55:38.360 --> 55:40.440]  Somebody that's how I guessed the last time and a bunch of
[55:40.440 --> 55:42.920]  readers said that is how you pronounce Postgres. I believe
[55:42.920 --> 55:46.040]  you can also know that one's right. You can leave off the
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.120]  PostgresQL. You can just call it Postgres. But anyway, what
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.600]  is it? It's a fully managed database service for those
[55:52.600 --> 55:56.520]  databases. And it is simple and reliable. You can easily
[55:56.520 --> 56:00.680]  deploy high performance database clusters. Managed databases
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.560]  allow you to quickly deploy a new database and defer
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.080]  management tasks like configurations and manage high
[56:07.080 --> 56:10.600]  availability, disaster recovery, backups, data replication
[56:10.600 --> 56:13.880]  with managed databases. Here's what you get from Linode.
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.360]  Simple and fast deployment, secure access, daily backups
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.880]  are included, and they have flexible plans. Look, they've
[56:21.880 --> 56:25.480]  got award-winning technical support, 24 hours a day, seven
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.240]  days a week, 365 days a year. You need technical
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.120]  support on New Year's Day, you can get it. And it's clear why
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.840]  developers have been trusting Linode for projects, both big
[56:34.840 --> 56:37.400]  and small, really small. You can do really small things at
[56:37.400 --> 56:39.880]  Linode for a really great price, and you can build really,
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.120]  really big things at enormous scale at a great price for an
[56:44.120 --> 56:47.400]  enormous scale. Linode makes cloud computing fast, simple,
[56:47.400 --> 56:50.200]  and affordable, allowing you to focus on your projects, not
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.360]  your infrastructure. Go to Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E, Linode.com
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.760]  slash the talk show. And by using that URL, Linode.com
[56:58.760 --> 57:02.040]  slash the talk show, you can create a free account using
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.120]  your Google or your GitHub accounts to sign into Linode or

[57:09.640 --> 57:13.320]  you get 100 bucks in credit, $100 just for going to Linode.com
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.320]  slash the talk show. Here's a camera. I want to talk on
[57:17.320 --> 57:19.960]  before we leave the iPhone 14. I wanted to talk about a camera
[57:19.960 --> 57:22.920]  issue. I sort of punted, and I've been doing this for years
[57:22.920 --> 57:26.200]  now where it's, I don't feel like I'm an expert photographer,
[57:26.200 --> 57:29.160]  and I feel like the people who are better than me at
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.800]  photography can do better, let them focus on the camera parts
[57:33.800 --> 57:37.960]  of their review. Camera-focused reviews. Yeah. And the curious
[57:37.960 --> 57:39.880]  thing, I mean, not curious, but the most interesting thing
[57:39.880 --> 57:42.120]  about the iPhone 14 Pro camera this year is that the
[57:42.120 --> 57:46.120]  quote-unquote main camera, which is for both 1x and 2x, now
[57:46.120 --> 57:50.760]  has a 48 megapixel sensor, and it's using something called
[57:50.760 --> 57:55.160]  pixel binning to treat each little square 2x2 square of four
[57:55.160 --> 58:01.080]  pixels as one pixel to make a 12 megapixel image. And by using
[58:01.080 --> 58:06.840]  four real pixels as one virtual pixel, it's a way to have an
[58:06.840 --> 58:13.720]  effective 12 megapixel sensor that greatly reduces noise. And
[58:13.720 --> 58:16.360]  everybody seems to agree to take a picture with the new
[58:16.360 --> 58:20.280]  iPhones in low light, and you look at, for the noise, you see
[58:20.280 --> 58:23.160]  a lot less noise, and that's great. But it is technically a
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.200]  48 megapixel sensor, and the only way to shoot 48 megapixel
[58:28.200 --> 58:34.920]  images is to shoot the ProRAW format. And I did play with this
[58:34.920 --> 58:37.480]  in my review before I wrote. I forget if I even mentioned it,
[58:37.480 --> 58:41.320]  but when you do shoot ProRAW, you get the option, do you want
[58:41.320 --> 58:47.560]  to shoot RAW 48 megapixel or RAW 12 megapixel? And you might
[58:47.560 --> 58:47.720]  think...
[58:47.720 --> 58:51.320]  Okay, so it's like the video where you can do 30, 60 FPS,
[58:51.320 --> 58:52.280]  that sort of thing.
[58:52.280 --> 58:55.160]  Right. Or, you know, like 1080, maybe a better comparison is
[58:55.160 --> 58:57.960]  1080p to 4K, because it's just resolution.
[58:57.960 --> 58:58.280]  Right.
[58:58.280 --> 59:00.680]  Well, why would you want to do that if you're shooting RAW?
[59:00.680 --> 59:04.920]  Don't you just want the RAW sensor data? And the answer is
[59:04.920 --> 59:08.840]  that it takes about a second for each shot. If you're shooting
[59:08.840 --> 59:14.200]  the 48 megapixel RAW images, you press the shutter in the
[59:14.200 --> 59:17.880]  iPhone camera app, and I don't know if it's a full second,
[59:17.880 --> 59:20.920]  but it feels like a second before it's available to shoot
[59:20.920 --> 59:21.640]  the next picture.
[59:21.640 --> 59:26.120]  So that's obviously suboptimal. And that's why they offer,
[59:26.120 --> 59:29.080]  even if you do want to shoot RAW to do all your development
[59:29.080 --> 59:32.520]  and editing with the RAW image, you could still shoot it as
[59:32.520 --> 59:33.480]  12 megapixels.
[59:33.480 --> 59:36.600]  But anyway, what I'm seeing in the reviews, Jason Snell's
[59:36.600 --> 59:39.880]  review, Mark Spoonhour at Tom's Guide had a good review and
[59:39.880 --> 59:44.600]  a lot of side-by-side images is, boy, there is a lot of your
[59:44.600 --> 59:47.480]  intuitive sense. And Apple's marketing, I think rightly so,
[59:47.480 --> 59:51.080]  has been away from megapixel wars for years and years.
[59:51.080 --> 59:56.360]  And that megapixels as a primary concern for somebody
[59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.920]  buying a new camera or buying a phone to use as a camera,
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.680]  it's probably not the biggest concern you have.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.080]  There's so many other factors in image quality.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.440]  But all that said, still more megapixels are better at some
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.680]  level. And it does seem like there's a lot of detail that
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.920]  the 48 megapixel sensor is capable of in a lot of light.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.880]  So that pixel binning to treat the 48 megapixel sensor as a
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.800]  12 megapixel sensor really makes the most sense in low light
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.560]  or even medium light. But with a lot of light like outdoors,
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.600]  there's plenty of light to just treat it as a 48 megapixels
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.080]  sensor. And the one thing you don't have the option of is to
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.480]  treat it as a 48 megapixel sensor shooting JPEG. You can
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.240]  shoot raw and get 48 megapixel. But now you've got these big,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.720]  huge 80 megabyte files each image, and you have to develop
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.840]  it manually like whatever software you use to edit one
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.440]  that uses to edit raw images. Wouldn't it be nicer if you
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.400]  could just say, I don't want to shoot raw, but I want the 48
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.240]  megapixel sensor size when there's plenty of light and just
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:08.280]  let me shoot JPEG or the HEIC. Do we pronounce that? Do you
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.720]  know? Or do we spell it out? I have no idea on that. I always
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:17.320]  forget it, too. JPEG, I'll never forget. But somehow HEIC, I'm
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.680]  always like, is it H-E-C-I-H-E-I-C? Whatever it is.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.360]  Yeah, I see that frequently, and it still hasn't stuck in my
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.640]  head. JPEG's been around forever. So when I say JPEG, I
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.600]  mean compressed images, and I'll just use it as shorthand for
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.560]  all of them. There is no option. You can't dig into settings
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.400]  and say, I would like to shoot JPEG and have the iPhone do the
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.600]  development of the raw image for me. And because it'll be
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.200]  compressed, I would guess that that means you could shoot at
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.080]  48 megapixels, and it wouldn't take a second for each shot
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:53.320]  because it's not moving that huge raw image. It's doing the
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.600]  processing before it moves it over to storage. But they don't
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.000]  offer that option. And I think I see why, but I'm just curious
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.280]  if you have thoughts on it, where as someone who designed
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.640]  software, sometimes you don't want to give users an option
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.600]  because you just don't want them to shoot themselves in the
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.960]  foot, right?
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.800]  Right. I mean, that's  so I'm just fiddling with this right
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.200]  now as you were talking about it. And when you take a raw in
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.120]  48 megapixels, it puts a little spinner on the screen, and it
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.480]  it's over a full second before that's done, before you can
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.120]  take another photo. But I'm looking at all the controls and
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.600]  there's  because there's controls for video too, where you
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.080]  can adjust 120 FPS versus 240 for slow-mo. But I don't think
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.280]   and they all have these little, what I call tiny text,
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.280]  under the control. And it says a minute of video will be
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.880]  approximately 45 megs for this, 65 megs for this, 100 megs for
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.440]  this. So you were talking about moving the file. Do you think
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.320]  that's what the delay is, or is it the processing?
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.160]  I don't know. I don't know enough about it. But it seems to
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.920]  me like it must  because at some level, it is using the
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.600]  whole 48 megapixel sensor to shoot the 12 megapixel images.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.200]  So at some point, I'm not quite sure. Maybe it's possible that
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.640]  even if they allowed you to shoot 48 megapixel JPEGs, that
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:19.960]  it would still take a second, because that's not where this
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.840]  takes a long time comes into play. I don't know.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.400]  Right.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.400]  But they don't even make it an option.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.800]  Right. My thought would be that if you're shooting in raw, you
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.320]  have to go turn the raw option on. So that's not even visible
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.440]  by default. If you're doing that, you either have decided
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.320]  to screw around with this or you know what you're doing. And
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.960]  so shooting in that 48, it being a little slow, that'll be
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.520]  acceptable to you. Whereas if you're just someone shooting
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.480]  normal camera shots, I think that delay would just be too
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.440]  much. And that'd be my guess for why it's not enabled.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.280]  Yeah. But it's like you don't want to. And I know there are
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.760]  times when Apple makes the mistake of seemingly babying
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.760]  users too much. I don't think this is a case. I think this
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.000]  is a case where they've a situation where they're enabling
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.240]  as much as they can for people who really do want to use
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.240]  their phones as pro cameras, which is what raw shooting is.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.080]  You need some kind of professional photo editing software
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:26.920]  to develop them properly. So they're making it possible, but
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:31.560]  they really don't want someone to accidentally think that, oh,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.680]  I've got the 512 gigabyte version. I can shoot. I'm not
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:39.960]  worried about the image size. I'll shoot 48 because 48 sounds
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.840]  four times bigger than 12. Sounds so much better. Sure.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.360]  Right. And then all of a sudden, they're in a situation
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.680]  where, yeah, that would work great in lots of light, but it
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.120]  doesn't work great. It doesn't work well at all in low light.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.160]  And now the whole point of the pixel binning strategy of
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.840]  shooting 12 megapixel images on a 48 megapixel sensor goes out
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.680]  the door. If the user just has like a yellow button at the top
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.520]  of the camera button to say 48 and they leave it on, they
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.800]  leave it on in the dark because it's a manual control that
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.960]  they've enabled. And I could just see how this is a very
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.920]  complicated dance for Apple internally to sort of whiteboard
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.200]  out the, okay, these are the options we will let people
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.720]  choose. These are the options we won't let them choose. And
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.200]  then these will be the defaults. I think if you step back, it's
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.880]  more, you're absolutely right, but it doesn't matter that it's
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.200]  a 48 megapixel camera. It's just we have, the iPhone 14 Pro
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.640]  now has a better camera. And that's what most people need to
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.800]  know that every year the camera gets better. And this year it's
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.240]  particularly better because of this pixel binning. And I think
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.840]  most people won't even be aware that, oh, there's a way that
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.000]  this could shoot a much bigger 48 megapixel image, but it's not
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.240]  letting me do it. I think almost nobody will be aware of it.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.960]  It's definitely a wonky kind of, you'll read about it in tech
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.440]  reviews, but not when you're using it. So to me, it definitely
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.080]  seems like the right call. If there's a downside, if there are
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.320]  these downsides, which it seems like there would be, then just
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.640]  don't even allow this option because most people aren't going
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.040]  to need it. Almost no one's going to need it. The people that
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.400]  do want it can do it in RAW. You've covered everybody who can
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.680]  take advantage of this pretty well.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.560]  Yeah, I would say so. And it kind of exemplifies the sort of
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.480]  feature that Apple will dive kind of deep into during the
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.360]  keynote, but then they're never going to mention it in their
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.000]  advertising.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:33.880]  In the ads, yeah.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.560]  They're not going to have these 48 megapixel sensor ads. And
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.080]  then people are like, why am I still shooting 12 megapixel
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.960]  images? And Apple is like, okay, we're going to need to make
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.520]  a longer ad. No, it's like, no, you don't want to explain this
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.240]  to people. I think you're right. Basically, you just open the
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.480]  camera app, you hit the shutter, you're going to get better
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.200]  looking pictures than you did last year or two years ago.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:56.600]  Exactly.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.240]  And the information is out there if you really want to dig
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.360]  into it and find out more.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:01.720]  Yeah.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.560]  So one of the open questions that I've had at least, and it
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.360]  seems like a lot of the other people who reviewed the iPhone
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.920]  14 Pro, it didn't bother them or it didn't obsess them like
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.120]  me, is, okay, if you've got any of the other phones, including
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.520]  the new regular iPhone 14s, brand new, just came out. The
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:25.080]  14 Plus isn't even out yet, right? It comes out next week.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.200]  Right, next month.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.040]  And you don't have the Dynamic Island. Where do your live
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.680]  activities show up other than your lock screen, right? Okay,
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.920]  everybody, I understand everybody's phone gets them on the
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.560]  lock screen, but you're just using your iPhone 14, but
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.960]  there's a live activity. Where does it show up if you don't
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:47.480]  have a Dynamic Island? And the developer documentation before,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.840]  and I think it's just one of those things where Apple being
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.040]  Apple and keeping things secret, and they successfully kept
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.440]  the Dynamic Island very secret, right? People knew.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.760]  Absolutely, yeah. Nobody knew about it until the announcement.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.600]  I would say it was one of the biggest secrets that they've
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.520]  kept under wraps in recent years. Nobody had any idea. People
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.400]  knew about the holes that were punched in the display, but
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.080]  everybody just assumed it would be a permanent oval shape. And
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.600]  I think, well, how do you keep it secret? You keep things
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.440]  secret by not telling people, right? It's the most obvious
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.920]  thing in the world. You keep a secret by never telling your
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.640]  secrets, but therefore the developer docs for live
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.400]  activities were all, I think even to some people inside
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.520]  Apple, they were in the dark about why are we being cagey
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.360]  about this? There's some obvious questions, but we're
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.480]  starting to get more answers. And one of them is that the
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.640]  the human interface guidelines now say, having been updated,
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.080]  having been updated a couple of times, they've been clarified,
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.040]  but they now say on devices that don't support the Dynamic
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.040]  Island, the system can display live activity update in a
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.320]  banner that appears briefly while people view the home
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:59.320]  screen or use another app, but only if the app determines that
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.840]  the update is important enough to interrupt people. Which is
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.560]  such a, that that last clause is so bizarre to me because
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.160]  like, it's basically saying like, but only if you think you
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.960]  should. And it's like, well, great. I'm developing whatever
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.400]  nonsense app that is interrupting people. I think I should
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.360]  interrupt people.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.360]  Well, I guess, I guess part of it is you're only going to get
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.800]  live activities when you've asked for them. So like, if you
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:37.320]  if you order food from the DoorDash app, and I think you
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.160]  have to I think, well, maybe not, I guess, or you hail a ride
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.000]  from Uber, it'll just become a live activity. But you're the
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  one who hailed the ride, right? So how frequently do you want
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.680]  updates about where your driver is, who's delivering your food
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.840]  or is coming by to pick you up to take you to the airport or
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.440]  whatever? It is the little ambiguous.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.560]  Yeah. Well, and so I don't know, like I mentioned something
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.360]  tangential to this, but they're talking about the, about
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.120]  putting ads in this space in live activities. And the
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.080]  language there was even worse. It said avoid using a live
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.680]  activity to display ads and promotions. Live activities help
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:27.480]  people stay informed. So it's important to display only
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.760]  information that's related to those events or tasks. Avoid
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.960]  using a live activity to display ads is so wishy washy. How
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.000]  about you just say it is forbidden to use a live activity
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.360]  to display ads?
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.800]  Yeah, and then you, it's, Neelay Patel brought this up on the
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.600]  last episode of my show, and he asked Apple about it and did
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.200]  not get a straight answer.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:48.920]  Of course not.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.480]  From them. And again, I think it's like one of those things
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.200]  where like a normal person, like me, doesn't even think
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.840]  about putting ads in the dynamic island. I'm just thinking
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:10:59.960]  that that's not the problem.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.960]  I know the problem is all of the abnormal people who are in
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.840]  product marketing at various companies and who are like,
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.160]  wait, we have a new area where we can put an ad and it's
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.960]  always visible no matter what it'll pop up. Right. Exactly.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:15.480]  No matter what other app, it's sort of like the holy grail of
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.560]  counting engagement is wait, we can still keep the ad up
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.960]  there. Even when they've left our app, they've left the app,
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.640]  but the ad can stay. Exactly. So, I mean, obviously the
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.280]  worst abuses of this, people will uninstall the app.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.640]  They'll delete the app. They'll complain about it, whatever.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.080]  But I mean, if you look at notifications, notifications,
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.320]  push notifications on your phone are not supposed to be
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.040]  used for promotions, for advertising, whatever. And I
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.840]  haven't looked at what the language is around that, but
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.920]  they are used that way. And there are various apps that I
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.320]  have that I either have turned off notifications or I've
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.920]  deleted because, oh, Lyft will say like, oh, for the next
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.960]  six hours, you can get 20% off on your next ride. And it's
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.400]  like, I don't care. I wasn't taking a ride. Stop bothering
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.440]  me. But that's an app where I want the notifications for
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.240]  like, your driver is three minutes away, so I can't turn
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.400]  off the notification. Most apps, I just turn off the
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.720]  notifications. I don't ever let them have the notifications
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.040]  and so I don't worry about it. But there's certainly some
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.200]  where they're abusing this and it's something that I don't
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.480]  have enough control over to say, don't show me the scammy
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.440]  ones, only show me the ones that I need. And both of these
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.840]  things are ambiguous enough or not restrictive enough that
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.320]  I'm concerned about how this is going to play out.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.600]  Yeah, and Uber and Lyft both have a lot of pure ads, not
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.560]  like, I'm not sure if this is really an ad or not. They've
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.320]  got all sorts of stuff in their apps for ordering food.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.280]  Like all I wanted was a ride to the airport. But now, you
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.000]  know, while I'm waiting and checking on where the car is,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.200]  I'm being told how do I can order Uber Eats and stuff like
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.640]  that. Get yourself some tacos. And I really don't want that
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.960]  in in the dynamic island. Like I'm, I love live views. Yeah.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.840]  And I said this on the last episode and I keep thinking
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:07.000]  about it. To me, the ride hailing app is on its way is
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.480]  the, to me, the best example of the dynamic island I can
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.800]  think of because whenever they're on their way to pick me
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.760]  up, it's always a couple more minutes than they told you it
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.520]  was going to be. It's like, yeah, we'll be there in four
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.160]  minutes. And then you say okay, and then you double click to
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.200]  pay with Apple Pay. And then they're like finding you a
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.600]  ride. Finding. Yeah. And it does a whole bunch of unnecessary
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.840]  animations to make you think something is happening. Yep.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.880]  Yep. It'll it'll flip. It'll twist. There's all sorts of
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.040]  it's like, Oh, now it's done. Nope, it's still looking. We're
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.560]  triangulating. Look at this. And then you find out it's nine
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.040]  minutes. And it's like, it's still again, it's like the the
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.840]  Louis CK bit about being in an airplane with Wi Fi and
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.360]  airplane and complaining about it. It's like you just dialed
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.400]  up a nice ride to go somewhere. So you don't need to take your
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.640]  own car. Just by poking your fingers at a phone. It's we're
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.200]  living in the future. This is great stuff overall. Why
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.240]  complain about the extra five minutes? But what do I do in
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.120]  those nine minutes while the car is on its way I spend time
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.240]  dicking around on my phone. And then I, I lose track of how much
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.200]  time has gone by. And I'm like, Oh, I bet the guys outside the
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.920]  Dynamic Island telling me Nope, there's still four minutes
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.440]  away. There's three minutes away. That seems like just what
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.720]  the doctor ordered. And I really do. I look forward to
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.200]  having that always on screen, no matter what else I'm doing
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.000]  with the phone for the nine or 10 minutes. I'm waiting for
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.240]  them to show up. But I, I will find it so annoying if they
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.520]  start showing me ads for Taco Bell. Your driver driving a
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.280]  silver Tesla Model Three is five minutes away. And by the
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.160]  way, you can get tacos at Taco Bell. That's
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:59.160]  get yourself a Mexican pizza. Right? It's so I, I guess we'll
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.400]  find out how it plays. But I'm, I'm, I'm the more I think about
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.920]  it, the more worried I am that we're gonna see ads up there
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.120]  from some of these are just nonsense in general. Yeah. Yeah,
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.520]  nonsense in general. Maybe you could say that's not
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.800]  technically an ad, but it's also nonsense. But it's from an
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.000]  app, you definitely want to have permission to send you this
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.480]  stuff. You can't just delete it or to have it stop sending
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.200]  notifications. The the non Dynamic Island story of this
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.800]  the what do people see? My guess was that it would be more or
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.400]  less like maps turn by turn directions. And that's sort of
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  the the best experience I can think of. I think it's that the
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.040]  if you have turn by turn directions on your phone, and
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.760]  there's some kind of change, like, Oh, you're getting your
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.880]  180 feet from where where the directions say make a left,
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.640]  then it comes back up. And then you make the left in the GPS
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.520]  tells you sees that you did it. And your next turn isn't for a
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.040]  couple miles, then it just appears disappears. And then it
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.880]  appears again, when it'll say something like not this light,
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.680]  but two lights from now make a right. That's pretty much
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.880]  exactly the experience for all of the live activities. But now
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.000]  you're asking all of these companies from sports companies
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.520]  to, I don't know, I don't know who else is going to use the
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.480]  Dynamic Island, but anybody sending sports scores to
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.800]  determine how often to interrupt you? Yeah. Like baseball, it's
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.280]  like every time a run scored, you can you should tell me about
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.520]  it football, every time points are scored, you should tell me
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.760]  about it from basketball, you certainly don't want that.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.760]  Right. If you're so interested in the football game that you
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.480]  really want to see every single play, you're probably shouldn't
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.600]  be following it in the dynamic in the in the live activity.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.040]  Yeah, exactly. So I don't know, we'll see how it goes. It's
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.160]  like, on the one hand, I still think it's going to be a great
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.120]  experience overall. I still think it's also think it's very
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.080]  very interesting that it's a major part of the iOS
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.280]  experience that is for this year, at least exclusive to the
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.800]  very newest pro model phones only. I think it'll turn out
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:10.120]  okay. But as we wait for the live activities APIs to become
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.480]  live, and third party developers to actually be able
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.480]  to ship apps that use them, so that we can see more of what
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.160]  the Dynamic Island can do. On the other hand, it's like,
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.080]  there's a part of me that's dreading it a little.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.720]  Well, it's interesting because it is, you talked a bunch about
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.280]  this in your review of the phone, just how it's new and how
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.520]  it's different. It is a new UI playground. It's small relative
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.680]  to the whole screen, but it's a new paradigm to think about
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.160]  like, how should my app interact with this? And what should I
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.720]  do with it? And obviously, these guidelines are helpful.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.720]  But there's all sorts of different apps that might do
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.920]  something there. And I can't even envision them yet, but I'll
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.880]  be very interested to see them. But yeah, there's certainly
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.600]  also the vague sense of dread with anything new these days
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.200]  where it's like, all right, how's somebody going to screw
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.440]  this up for me? In a way that I never would have guessed,
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.400]  right? Right. Because like you said, I'm a normal person and
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.200]  I'm not evil. Right. Like I'm sitting here worried about
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.080]  Taco Bell ads from Uber. And meanwhile, if there's anybody
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.680]  out there from like Uber, the type of team at Uber who puts
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.080]  these things in there, they're like, that's the dumbest idea
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:18.520]  ever. We've got 20 other that are way worse, way worse, but
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.680]  we're going to make way more evil than that. Come on, we can
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.760]  do better than that. All right, let's take a break here. We'll
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.720]  move on from the iPhone unless you have more on the iPhone.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.400]  But no, you know, it's it's a new iPhone. It looks a lot like
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.040]  the old iPhone. It seems pretty good. I don't know. All right,
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.960]  let me take a break here. Thank our next sponsor. It's our good
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.760]  friends at Retool, R-E-T-O-O-L. Internal tools, any custom
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.480]  software you build to help your employees operate better can
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.760]  dramatically impact every part of your business. But building
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.680]  internal tools from scratch and maintaining them requires a lot
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.680]  of engineering time and tedious work. Retool is a much faster
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:55.720]  way to build internal tools. They offer a complete library
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.320]  of over 90 fully integrated accessible UI components that
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.920]  you just drag and drop into any interface that you want to
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.520]  design. It's one platform to build your interface, connect to
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.160]  any data source or API and publish employee facing apps in
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.760]  record time. So you do the deployment right through Retool.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.200]  It is also incredibly flexible. You can write custom code
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.920]  nearly anywhere to customize how your app looks and works and
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.040]  app environments, SSO permissions and other critical
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.720]  app functionality are all available right out of the box.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:32.760]  The result is that you can build production grade internal

[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.160]  not 14, Apple Watch Ultra came out since the last I've yet to
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:12.280]  see one. You've you've got one wearing this right now or
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.960]  you've got one. I've I've still wearing mine. I haven't taken
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.400]  it off since the or so we're using it as my main watch,
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.520]  although I'm curious. I actually should have maybe tried
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.640]  going back to my regular series seven from last year before the
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.520]  show to see if I feel like it's tiny, but I'm curious what you
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.680]  say. You haven't like popped into an Apple store to see one
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.760]  yet. Not yet now. I'm I'm interested to look at it. Your
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.680]  review had some good notes on sizing and saying like the the
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.560]  gist of it was that if if it looks bad to you, then don't get
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.720]  it obviously, but if you're worried that other people are
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:46.040]  going to think it looks bad that they'll think the watch
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.480]  looks bad, not you and I think that is very true. But to me, I
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:52.120]  have worn the smaller watch size for a long time. I like the
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.080]  smaller watch size and that everything that I see makes it
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.960]  look enormous. So, I'm interested to try it on, but I'm
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.480]  not terribly interested in the product. Right and I you and I
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.720]  are pals and I've seen you. You've had a couple other
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.360]  watches over the years. What was the one you had that was
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.920]  solar powered? Wasn't it a Seiko? No, it was kinetic
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.480]  powered. Yeah, yeah, but it was a Seiko. Or kinetic powered, but
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.600]  yeah, I know you've had other watches and you're not as big a
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.400]  watch nerd as I am, but you know you have some. But in
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.640]  recent years, I don't know. I can't remember the last time I
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.400]  saw you without your Apple Watch on. Oh yeah, I would say a
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.680]  devoted Apple Watch user. You're also a fitness enthusiast.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.720]  You're a runner and so the fitness features play right play
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.880]  into that. I don't think though you're you to my knowledge, you
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:39.240]  don't really do anything impacty for lack of a better
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.440]  word. Do you dive? Well, something that you would say, oh,
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.160]  I need the ultra because I keep smashing my Apple Watches.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.920]  Right, right, right. No, yeah, I haven't knocked wood. I
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.640]  haven't broken any of the faces or anything. I mean, some of
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:56.200]  the running stuff, I do longer races where the battery life
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.600]  does play into it a little bit or it has to be considered.
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.240]  Like if you run a marathon, even with the most recent Apple
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.040]  Watches, you at least need to be concerned about the battery
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.840]  life and figure out some ways to alleviate some of the
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.800]  pressures on it. But yeah, the the pitch that they have for
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.320]  doing a doing 100 mile race or scuba diving or whatever,
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.840]  that's none of that is directly appealing to me anyway.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.560]  Yeah. So the biggest appeal to you would be the battery life.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.680]  Battery life. And yeah, I think so. I think so. Yeah.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.640]  Combined with the fact that you can do the battery life and
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.440]  have more accurate GPS tracking, right? The GPS, I saw
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.840]  that that was more accurate. And I've used the Apple Watch,
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.240]  I've run with it for seven years now. And I don't know how
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.520]  inaccurate it is. I know it's not perfect. But when I go out
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.360]  and I do a six mile run, if that's 5.9 miles or if that's
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.080]  6.1 miles, it doesn't really matter. So I'm not that
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.680]  concerned with the with the GPS being super precise.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.760]  Yeah, it seems to me from what I can gather, and again, Apple,
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.520]  it's one of those things where they're not going to throw the
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.400]  other Apple Watches under the bus and say, yeah, the GPS
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:05.560]  really kind of sucks. But so it's it's always an interesting
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.240]  dance for me to watch is how do they say this one has much
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:12.280]  better GPS tracking, but there's nothing wrong with the
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.680]  GPS on the other. But everything in the old ones is fine, of
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.120]  course. Yeah, the ones we're still selling anyway. I get the
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.960]  opinion that basically they figured out that there's a
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:26.440]  there's a sub market of runners and cyclists and maybe other
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.320]  activities but who really, really want the GPS to be
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.080]  precise, whether they need it to be or not. I get it. Like I get
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.360]  caring about details like that, right? Like that it uses
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.720]  Helvetica instead of aerial or something that most people
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:44.360]  would consider superficial. Who cares? Most people would
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:48.280]  think if you're if you're running through downtown Boston
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.920]  makes it look like you cut through a building at one point
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.280]  around the corner. You know where you ran if you look back
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.000]  at the track and you're like, Oh, that's the time I ran this
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.680]  way. And that that it looks like it cut through a corner
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.400]  doesn't bother you. Whereas other people, it bothers them
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.440]  and I get it right, right. And and I think also there are
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:11.000]  other competing GPS watches that that don't have the problem.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.600]  And so I can also definitely see how if you're already wearing
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.920]  something from Garmin or one of these other companies and when
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:22.680]  when you wear that watch and you go on a bike ride, the GPS is
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.400]  completely accurate or as accurate as you think is
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.840]  reasonable for GPS. And then you've tried an Apple Watch and
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.160]  it's mostly accurate, but cuts off corners around skyscrapers
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.000]  and stuff like that. That's a hard switch because you're
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.200]  already used to the one that's more accurate. It's always hard
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.680]  to go backwards, right? Once you've switched to something
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.000]  with a retina display, nobody ever complained about the
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.160]  retina, the non retina displays on MacBook Airs until all the
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.160]  other products right until until all their iPhones and iPads
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.120]  had retina displays. And here's this MacBook with these giant
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.720]  pixels that didn't bother you until three years ago. But now
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:02.200]  you got used to it. Well, once you're used to the fine grain
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.960]  GPS accuracy seems hard to go back. The battery life seems to
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.200]  me, though, like the one of the killer features that might lead
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.800]  if the Apple Watch Ultra turns into a bigger hit. I don't know
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.960]  now that I'm expecting but maybe then people's if it hits
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.080]  the over on the over under for what people's gut feeling is for
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.080]  how popular it'll be battery life could be the biggest one
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.160]  because it it affects almost everybody especially fitness
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.880]  people right like people who do two hour workouts if you've got
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.200]  the watch tracking your fitness the whole time it definitely
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.200]  takes a hit on the other ones whereas with the ultra it it's
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:44.920]  the difference in battery life is just it's hard to you can
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.040]  list the numbers but it's it's very different in practice it's
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.640]  like wait I haven't charged that I've been wearing this other
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.240]  than in the shower for a day or two and I haven't charged it
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:59.240]  and it's still at 50% that that doesn't it like totally breaks
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:03.000]  my mind with how I think of an Apple Watch. But the thing the
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.640]  thing to me is that so I used to wear a non smartwatch and I
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.880]  didn't have to charge it at all literally walking around
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.160]  charged it and so I never took it off I didn't think about it
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.960]  whatever I had a pebble for a little while and I can't
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.440]  remember I think I had to charge that like once a week
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.160]  maybe every three or four days but when I got the Apple Watch
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.320]  every night I had to take it off I had to charge it and that
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.960]  just became the routine and so the thing for me is that if if
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.240]  the Apple Watch lasted two days instead of one day it really
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.840]  wouldn't do me any good because I'm still just gonna I either
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.040]  have to charge it every other day which is a weird schedule or
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.880]  I'm just gonna throw it on the charger every night and I'm
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.120]  never gonna get below 50% so for for an actual activity if
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.280]  you're out there doing an ultra marathon you're running 100
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.800]  miles and you're you need that battery to to last that whole
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.680]  time it makes perfect sense but in terms of like day to day
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:58.040]  usage my watch is now two plus years old and I usually run in
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.040]  the morning and I'll play tennis at night or something
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:02.920]  like that and either I don't have to charge it at all or
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.920]  I'll throw it on the charger for a few minutes during the
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.040]  day but it's not something where like when I got it it was
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.760]  certainly good for the entire day and I just charge it every
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.320]  night and I never thought about it so a little bit more
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:16.760]  battery even if it's a whole even if it's 100% more battery
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.800]  to me wouldn't really change the way I wore it so I find that
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.440]  interesting that that like some of the garments they talk about
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.000]  literally weeks of using this actively using it with that
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.960]  without needing to charge it and that is then you change the
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.000]  way you use it entirely but an extra day doesn't really do
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.400]  anything for me I found the longer I wear it now that my
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.480]  reviews out and I'm I guess two weeks in or almost two weeks
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.120]  into wearing it for me as somebody who's not as active as
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.920]  I should be perhaps and even if I were more active my level of
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.120]  of exercise wouldn't wear out the battery on a regular Apple
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:59.240]  watch not running marathons so I can't say I need it and I the
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.920]  other thing is that having two effectively two day battery life
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.800]  maybe more than two I think it's possible that I could be
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.920]  getting more than two days of battery life from this watch
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:12.120]  that's sort of like an uncanny valley of battery life where
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.000]  you're right that's what I'm saying yeah yeah and and and it
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.680]  almost works against you because I've grooved over the
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:24.200]  last few years the idea that I charge my Apple watch cuz I do
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.280]  like wearing it to sleep so ever since they've done the
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.080]  sleep tracking which I wanna talk to you about I do the
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:32.360]  sleep tracking and I like I really like wearing my Apple
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.280]  watch as I I've always worn a watch to bed cuz I just like
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.560]  right having a watch on my wrist but it's really hard to
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.480]  read all of my mechanical watches in a dark room and they
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.840]  don't all of my watches aren't the type that have like a
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.560]  they're not they're mechanical so there's no button to hit to
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.840]  make light yeah right so it's like a somebody who just wants
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.760]  to vaguely see is this is it like it's still dark is it
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.800]  three in the morning is it five in the morning what time I just
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.920]  wanna glance at it the Apple watch is fantastic cuz it's and
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.280]  they do a really nice job of keeping the screen really dim so
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.760]  it's not like you're staring at something but I I've just
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.760]  grooved that I whenever I take a shower I charge the watch and
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.560]  in the morning when I make coffee I charge my watch in the
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.280]  kitchen and that's usually the one that gets the biggest
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.920]  charge and I cuz I'll just sit there and read the news and
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.520]  stuff after I've started drinking coffee and just let the
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.400]  watch keep charging until my phone says hey the watch is
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.680]  fully charged and then I take it off and I'm good to go. Oh
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.120]  does it does it ping you? It does on your phone. Huh I've
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.680]  never seen that because like I said I just I throw it on the
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.880]  bedside charger overnight and in the morning I put it on it's
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.600]  already at 100% my phone's been asleep so it hasn't it hasn't
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.360]  told me that it's charged. Interesting I did not know that
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.600]  it did that. Yeah and it probably just eats that
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.640]  notification when it knows that it's charging overnight. It's
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:53.880]  like you don't even need to worry about this. You've got
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.160]  enough stupid. You have enough stupid notifications to deal
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:01.240]  with. Right. Now the do not it always feels like that's your
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.960]  iPhone's worst news of the day is when you turn off your
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.160]  overnight focus whatever you wanna call it. And then it pops
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.480]  up on a bunch of crap that happened. It's like while you
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.120]  were in do not disturb here you go and it's like you're you're
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.080]  all of a sudden you're like a busy executive and you have a
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:18.520]  personal assistant who's got like a stack of those. Sir sir
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.000]  sir. Yeah. You got this call and that call and you're ten
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.160]  o'clock is here. Right. The last thing you needed to hear
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.280]  was that your watch was fully charged at seven in the morning.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.760]  Right. You're like of course it was. I left it on overnight.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.680]  But it not charging every day like charging every other day
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:36.120]  is no way to groove a habit. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. It
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.960]  doesn't it so I think I would just still charge it every day
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.680]  because that's been my habit and it would still be necessary
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.280]  every other day. So yeah I think I think I need a week. I
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.400]  need two weeks before I would change the way that I wore
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.600]  this. Yeah. And I've the other thing one of the questions I've
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.480]  gotten since my review came out is does it take longer to
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:58.280]  charge? Yes, it definitely does because there's like two
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.560]  charging cables now and you could tell which one is higher
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:05.960]  speed because it has USB-C on the the charger end on on the
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:11.000]  okay the brick end and then the old Apple watch charger cable
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.720]  has the USB-A on the other end and it's I don't know 7.5 volts
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.120]  instead of five or watts. I don't know but it's faster and I
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:23.400]  definitely notice how much faster it is with my series
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.200]  seven which I think was the first watch that I had that
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.480]  had the newer cable. Like it seems like all of a sudden my
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.440]  morning charge my Apple watch routine it goes by really fast
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:35.800]  but now with this one when I look at it and it's like low
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.280]  it's like oh it's all the way down at like for this watch
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.720]  it's like 29% feels low. It does. Okay. It takes a long time
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:45.160]  to charge to get up to 100% but then I think to myself well
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.520]  why even why am I even charging it 200%? Who cares? But like
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:53.800]  yeah it's it's a very it's the battery life of it breaks so
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.520]  many little habits I've developed over the years with
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.320]  Apple watch is what I'm trying to say where I because I've got
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.720]  it in my head that at the if I am going to charge my Apple
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.080]  watch I should definitely charge it to 100 because battery life
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.960]  is one day at best whereas with this one I don't know if if I
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.280]  knew I was going to be able to charge it every morning
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.880]  charging it to 50 or 60 percent would be fine. More than enough
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.000]  yeah so I don't know. I guess before we move on I did want to
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.640]  say that's the other thing and I don't think I talked about it
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.360]  maybe in my review enough where I emphasize that maybe you can
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.200]  get one can get away man or woman small-wristed big-wristed
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.960]  you might be able to get away with a much bigger watch than
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.920]  you think just because you're not used to wearing a big
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:38.440]  watch. It'll look really weird to you and your first person
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.800]  perspective it's sort of like you've got like a fisheye lens
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.920]  because your wrist is only 12 to 18 inches away from your
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:49.320]  eyes whereas everybody else who sees you wearing a watch is
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:53.000]  several feet away from you. Oh no I get my wrist all up in
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.680]  people's faces John so I that's I gotta size it the same way
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:01.480]  yeah but so I hopefully did a good job of it of
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:05.240]  encouraging people who might be ultra curious to just give it a
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.960]  try if you really think oh I'd love to do it but boy I just
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.080]  don't know that I could pull off that that thing you should
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.200]  probably try it but on the other hand are people like I
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.360]  know so many people like you I think Marco wears the smaller
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.040]  size 3841 millimeter Apple Watch size. I know lots of men
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.400]  who prefer the smaller Apple Watch size and for me it's
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:32.600]  always been I mean I'm tall-ish I'm 6'2 but I've got fairly
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.800]  skinny wrists so it's always been right from the first one
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.880]  it always seemed borderline to me which one looks best on my
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:45.800]  or and which I prefer on my watch the smaller or bigger and
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.000]  I think it's been such such a tremendous success for Apple
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.360]  that they're they've never been branded as the men's and women's
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.400]  and women's yeah 100%. I remember I remember the first
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.680]  year I got the larger one and then I can't remember if it was
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.880]  the second or or I had I've had the zero the two the four and
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.160]  the six I can't remember if I switch with the two or the four
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.440]  but I remember at the time thinking like well you know this
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.480]  it's the smaller one but whatever and I tried it on and
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.720]  it fit well and no one's ever going to look at it and think
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.680]  like oh you're wearing a women's watch whereas certainly
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.960]  some mechanical watches some other wristwatches are very
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.440]  clearly pink or I don't even know what sort of frills they
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:29.560]  would have but are very clearly aimed at women right and would
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.440]  look strange wearing it as a man who doesn't want to be
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440]  wearing a women's watch and yeah you're absolutely right
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:38.120]  that it's just two sizes and whatever feels right to you is
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:42.280]  totally fine and and there's not any gender or anything to it
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.640]  right and there might be there are some gender oriented
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.080]  designs and have been from the get-go with certain of the
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.000]  straps right sure and there have been both like not just
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.440]  talking about the the truly high-end Hermes ones but even
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.640]  the ones from Apple most of the straps are available in both
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.760]  sizes of the watch but then there'd be certain leather ones
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.960]  that were only available for the small one and they did have
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.280]  more of a female oriented design language and some bigger
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.760]  ones that seemed more inherently masculine but in in
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.560]  none of the cases are the ones from Apple seemingly more than
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.080]  a gentle hint at a gender and it's always been the exception
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.920]  not the norm most of the straps are exactly the same for both
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:31.160]  sides of the watch sure I've always thought that was it was a
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.200]  big part of the appeal and it's something that very few other
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:37.000]  companies I think could have pulled off no I think it was
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.760]  very well done and and and still to this day like none of
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:43.560]  it is branded that way and and again whatever whatever you
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.520]  like is is fine yeah but I do think but anyway I guess where
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.480]  I was going with this is that as much as I tried to talk some
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.120]  people into at least considering the big chunky ultra and maybe
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.400]  it'll work for you in a way you didn't expect I also know that
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.600]  there are people who really like a smaller watch you being
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.600]  among them and if that's you it's probably the ultra is
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.480]  probably gonna make you laugh when you try it on because right
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.720]  no I I'm interested to try it on and I I have no intention of
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.680]  buying it and I can't imagine being convinced that I should
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.600]  buy it and I think I'm gonna look at it and say yep that's
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:20.520]  enormous and I don't want it and that'll be the end of it. I
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.400]  think that a lot of people over the next couple of months when
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.200]  they finally go into an Apple store to to check it out are
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.960]  gonna have that same experience where as much as I tried to
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.280]  talk people into it the single biggest reason most people
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.800]  won't get it well price maybe if if because it starts at 800
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:40.520]  bucks but the size alone will keep an some number of both men
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.080]  and women from wearing it. When they introduced it I was
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.960]  interested to to know about it as an Apple product but I said
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.920]  yep that's a huge watch and I've never had one of the giant
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.640]  Garmin GPS watches. I've I've always had a relatively small
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:56.760]  watch and that's what I want and so this is almost a non
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.160]  starter for me. If it were if it were any other company I
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.480]  would just not even be interested at all in here. It's
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.880]  just like I'll try it on and and that'll be the end of it.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.240]  So alright, let me take another break here and thank our next

[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.800]  from a smaller competitor of theirs, so I won't name them.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.120]  But I'll tell you what, it's very nice. Getting a custom
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.560]  suit, they, they fit you and it feels good. So I don't know
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.960]  enough about this particular sponsor, but I know that the
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.920]  general concept is something worth doing. It seems like
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.600]  something that it's for men of a certain generation like me
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.160]  sort of fell out of favor. It's like, you don't know how I
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.400]  don't, I never really learned how to buy a suit. And it's
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.800]  like, yeah, you know what? You really, you want a suit that,
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.960]  that meant to fit you. That fits properly. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  I did not write a review. I've had the AirPods Pro 2 second
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.120]  generation since the Apple event, which is slightly
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.160]  unusual now. Yeah. So meta commentary on it. It's slightly
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:37.720]  unusual for Apple to seed products more than a week and a
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:41.160]  half of their availability to the public. Reviewers, in my
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.760]  experience, almost never get them. They, we were, the
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.880]  embargo for them was not until last week. I think the same or
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:51.240]  the day after the, the Apple watch ultra reviews came out.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.040]  The embargo date for the reviews was around the same time
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.640]  as Apple watch ultra, but they didn't let us, we didn't leave
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.600]  to my knowledge, none of us who got Apple watch ultra to
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.800]  review. We didn't leave Cupertino with them back on
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.240]  September 7th or whatever the date of the event was. They
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.960]  sent them the next week because they weren't coming out till
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.840]  the next week after that. So they, but they gave you the
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.320]  headphones, right? They did give us the headphones because
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.280]  they, they said they wanted us to pair them with the iPhone 14.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.320]  I will say though, having Switch and I've been an AirPods Pro
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:27.320]  user since they came out. Okay. In 2019. Late 2019. Big, big
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.000]  fan. I don't think I wear, other than to podcast where I
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.640]  wear these big over the ear things, I never wear any other
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:39.000]  kind of headphones. I enjoyed the review unit AirPods Max
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.560]  that they sent me and I was like, wow, these really sound
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.360]  interesting, but I don't go, there's no part of my life
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.640]  anymore where I would wear headphones like that. Yep. I
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.480]  even on air, that's the, the, the last barrier for me would
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.360]  be like wearing them on an airplane, but AirPods Pro, I
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:59.400]  find so much better on an airplane because they, they
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.120]  don't make my ears sweat. They're way more comfortable if
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.760]  I do manage to doze off, right? Nothing can wake you up more
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.080]  than when your head hits your shoulder, but you've got big
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.560]  over the ear, giant over the ear headphone. Right. And it
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.600]  feels like somebody just boxed you in your ear. And the noise
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.280]  canceling is just great. It's, it's been a great product. I,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.880]  and I typically though, wear them my, by far and away, my
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.000]  most overwhelming, commonly common use case of wearing my
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.760]  AirPods Pro is as a pedestrian here in center city,
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.720]  Philadelphia, where I will leave the house. I put them in,
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.520]  I put a podcast on and run some errands or just take a walk
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.480]  center city, Philadelphia, as a pedestrian wearing them. And
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.720]  the second generation ones are for a product that looks almost
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.480]  the same. It's really quite different. So the one thing that
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.600]  was a real game changer for me, going from old AirPods, the
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:00.120]  non-pro ones that didn't have noise cancellation, all the way
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:06.920]  back to wired earbuds and iPods and 20 years of, of that style
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.520]  of, of, and you as a fellow East coaster, it's like, we get
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.560]  spoiled by technology, but it's like, as somebody else on the
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.640]  East coast, like who likes to listen to audio once in a while,
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:22.360]  the winter time, trying to snake the cable of your wired
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.920]  earbuds around your winter coat and whatever other layers of
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.880]  clothing, it was, Oh, what a pain in the ass it was, but I
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.840]  did it anyway for years and years. And now it feels like
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.400]  number one reason I couldn't go back. So I liked the original
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.680]  AirPods that didn't have noise canceling too, just to get rid
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.800]  of the cable. But the noise cancellation of the first
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.200]  generation AirPods pro was game-changing for me. It spoke
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.440]  to me when I first started wearing them. Cause I felt a
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.760]  little unsafe crossing streets because I use my ears. I do look
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:57.240]  both ways before crossing the street, but as a pedestrian in
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.840]  the city, you use all of your available senses and it's good
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.120]  to hear a truck or a bus that's coming down to down the street
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.280]  and noise cancellation was so good. It sort of freaked me
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.120]  out, but I got used to it. And I, I think they dialed it over
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.680]  the certain gender versions of the AirPods firmware and they
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:21.880]  tweaked it to the point where with my first gen AirPods pro,
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.480]  I almost always had them in noise cancellation mode over
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.280]  the last year or two while out and about walking around the
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.880]  city, because it does cancel out things like a bus that goes
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.720]  by. Whereas for years past, if a bus went by and I'm listening
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:39.480]  to a podcast, now I'd have to, I'd hear the bus coming. I'd
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.320]  pause the podcast for until the bus went by and then turn it
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:47.560]  back on. You don't need to do that anymore. The weird thing
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:52.120]  about the AirPods pro second generation is the noise
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.680]  cancellation is definitely better. Apple says up to two
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.480]  times better. I believe it. It, it is downright spooky at
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:03.720]  times. It is freakish. How little of your surrounding noise
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.680]  you hear to the point where I don't, I, I still, I feel the
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:09.480]  same way I did with the original ones as a pedestrian in the
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.280]  city. I feel like this is dangerous. I should not be
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.160]  crossing the street while I can't hear anything. But the
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.760]  weirder thing, cause I don't think I, I actually watched this
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:21.800]  section of the keynote again. It was the whole part of the
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.600]  keynote where they had the, the woman who was doing the
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:29.880]  introduction walk from a subway car to a jackhammering guy to a
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:33.880]  noisy cafe. She was talking about transparency mode. She
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:38.920]  was talking about both forms of algorithmic audio adjusting
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:42.920]  that the AirPods. It's much more clear to me now though,
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.760]  having used them, how much she and Apple were trying to
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.720]  emphasize that transparency mode really helps you in a
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.160]  noisy situation. You don't have to turn on noise cancellation
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.280]  to walk around the city and have a bus go by or something
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.720]  noisy go by and not be able to still hear the podcast you're
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:04.040]  listening to or the music that you're listening to.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:09.000]  Right. So, so you're describing using noise canceling all the
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.520]  time and I, I live in a city, I live in Boston and I run a lot
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.560]  and I almost never use the noise canceling for the exact
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.640]  reason you were describing of like, I want to be able to
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.640]  hear a bus, hear whatever. Running, it's, it's certainly
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.480]  more dangerous because I have less time to react if
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.440]  something's coming. So I've almost always used transparency
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.120]  mode with the AirPods Pro first generation where it's
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.160]  actually feeding some of the outside audio into my ears to
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.480]  make up for the fact that your ears are plugged by these,
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.960]  these buds. And it's worked pretty well. Like I get good
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.680]  audio from whatever music I'm listening to, whatever. But
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.040]  the, the biggest pain for me was when you, you mentioned a
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.080]  bus, I always, for me, it's fire trucks. Fire trucks will
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.560]  scream by with their sirens going. And I don't know how
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.400]  much the AirPods are doing to recognize and figure
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.400]  anything out, but mostly it felt like it was feeding that
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.640]  directly into my brain. And so you're, you're talking about
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.800]  the transparency mode on the second one, second generation
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.960]  where it's, what do they call it? Adaptive transparency
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.400]  mode. Right. And, and the idea is that it will say, okay,
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.640]  this is a noise you need to hear. This is maybe somebody
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:12.040]  talking to you. You should feed that into their ear, but
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:14.920]  here's a fire truck. Don't feed that into their ear. In fact,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.360]  cancel it out a little bit. Right. And I'm, I'm super into
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.240]  this idea. I definitely want to, I'm very interested in
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.760]  upgrading to these. It works so much better than I expected
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.360]  it to be possible to work. I don't know why that is because
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.640]  it seems like noise cancellation is the more
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.960]  challenging technical problem. I don't know. But, and I just,
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.080]  I took transparency mode for granted to some degree with the
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:44.280]  Air, my first AirPods Pro, but with the new one, I kept
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.960]  finding myself over and over again. Like I'd get, I'd go out
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.720]  and go to a neighborhood coffee shop to get an afternoon iced
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:56.280]  coffee. And, and, and I want to hear the baristas. And so I
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.320]  paused the podcast and then I would always think to myself,
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.680]  well, I also have to turn off transparency or turn on
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.400]  transparency so I can hear the surrounding. Right. And then
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.720]  I'd realize I was already in it and I'd gotten all the way
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:10.360]  from my house to there thinking I was in noise cancellation
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:14.200]  mode. Not because the noise sounded canceled, but because I,
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.280]  I guess the bottom line is you just don't even notice, right?
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.320]  All you hear is the content you're trying to listen to on a
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:25.720]  podcast. And the way that it adaptively plays your
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:29.320]  surroundings without getting, letting it get so loud that you
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.640]  can't hear the last 10 seconds of the conversation. It just
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:36.600]  disappears, right? It's like that camera feature we were
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.160]  talking about an hour ago where people just want to point their
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:41.640]  camera at a thing and hit a button and a nice looking
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:44.920]  picture shows up. You just hit play and transparency mode and
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.320]  you're in a noisy city. It, it really works. Now, is it a
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.600]  surefire upgrade at 250 bucks, right? That's what they cost.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.800]  They're 250 bucks to 49 for somebody who's first gen airpods
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.400]  pro still have fine battery life. I that's, that may not be
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.080]  a surefire upgrade for a lot of people, but if you can find a
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.000]  home, somebody else who, you know, isn't grossed out by your
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.480]  old AirPods pro, you know, take some alcohol and get some new
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.440]  tips for them. Those are cheap. Yeah. Just the tips. That's
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:23.640]  right. End joke right there. No, just get them some new tips.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.200]  And if they're still credible, but I think that somebody who
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:30.280]  really enjoys it, it, it feels like an upgrade. So for me, this
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.280]  is something where when they announced this, I thought that
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.520]  sounds really interesting. I've had these pros since late 2019,
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.000]  fall of 2019. I use them when I run. I use them around town.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.800]  So they've gotten plenty of use. They've been great. And I'm
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:46.840]  interested in the new ones. But yeah, the, the fact that you
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.000]  can't, I think you can trade them in, but you're not going to
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.440]  get much money. So the fact that they still work makes me say
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.520]  like, all right, today, I'm not going to buy them the day they
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:57.480]  come out. But you know, we got, we got some holidays coming up.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:00.440]  Maybe somebody will gift them to me or something. We'll see.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.560]  But the one, the one thing holding me back besides the fact
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:08.520]  that my current ones work is the case, because this is still,
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.760]  it's still a lightning case. And it seems very clear that
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:16.600]  everything's going to USB-C in a year or two. The iPad has gone
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.280]  USB-C. My MacBook Air sitting in front of me is USB-C. And
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.400]  having traveled a little bit in the past few months for the
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.040]  first time in a while, it's been really annoying. And it's
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.880]  such a, it's such a minor complaint, but it's been really
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.440]  annoying to say like, oh, I got to have this USB-C cable for
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.760]  this. And I got to have this lightning cable for this. And
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.720]  even just looking at my desk, I've got a couple USB-C cables,
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:38.360]  and then I've got a lightning cable over here where the only
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.400]  reason I have it is for the AirPods and for the phone. And
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:44.520]  the phone, I'm on an annual, I'm on their upgrade program. So
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.040]  if it's USB-C next year, I'll have a USB-C iPhone. But the
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.840]  the AirPods Pro, if I buy them now, and next year they have a
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.480]  USB-C case, it's, I'm going to be annoyed.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.960]  It's because it'll be the one thing holding you back from the
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:58.520]  all the USB-C travel lifestyle.
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:49:59.080]  Exactly.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.360]  Yeah, I thought about that when they announced it and said it's
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.440]  lightning again, my thought was if they said, okay, and here's
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.680]  the new case, and it charges with USB-C,
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.040]  then you'd know everything's going USB-C next year.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.960]  That's what I would say. That's a surefire sign that the next
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.760]  version of everything is going to have USB-C. And this is just
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:21.960]  the first one. So who knows if there's going to be a new Apple
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.120]  TV hardware product this fall, but if there is, and it has a
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.840]  new updated remote, if the AirPods Pro case had been USB-C,
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:34.040]  then I would guess that the remote would be USB-C too.
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:37.320]  And now they'll start doing one at a time. The fact that it's
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.120]  still lightning doesn't to me prove the otherwise. It just
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:45.720]  means that they're not going to tip their hand yet. And then
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.680]  all of a sudden, if the iPhone 15 comes out next year and does
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.680]  have USB-C, they'll just update the case with USB-C and all of
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:56.360]  us who bought it in the first year as carrying around a
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:01.720]  lightning cable till the headphones wear out. Which
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.760]  actually does seem more like the Apple way of doing it. Don't
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:08.760]  tip the hand with the case that we're shifting everything to
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:13.880]  USB-C. We'll just release a new case and annoy people in a
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:18.840]  year. Pretty much, yeah. And that's one, as you said, I think
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.560]  that would be my last, I guess I've got a keyboard in front of
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.280]  me that's lightning, but I charge that once a month. That I
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.320]  can hold a lightning cable on, hold on to a lightning cable
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:30.360]  for. I would have a new phone that was USB-C. All my device
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:33.560]  would be USB-C. And I honestly think I would buy the new case
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.720]  at that point. If I got the headphones and then there was a
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:41.160]  USB-C case. That'd be such an annoying like $60 purchase, but
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:44.840]  I think I would do it. Oh, I'm annoyed just thinking about it.
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:49.240]  So the other fun thing with the case, have you seen this, that
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:53.560]  if you get your case custom engraved, now when you flip open
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.160]  the case to like check it, check the battery life with your
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:01.320]  iPhone and that panel appears. If you have a custom engraving,
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:04.760]  the custom engraving will appear on the case. It shows on
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.880]  that screen. I haven't seen that. I mean, that's like a
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:10.920]  perfect little Apple touch that's exactly the sort of thing
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:15.000]  they do. And I know that it's a Tim Cook-ism to say only Apple
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.400]  can do blank, but there are certain things that it seems
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.040]  like only Apple could do, and it really does. It's not just the
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  integration of hardware and software. It's also the Tim Cook
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:30.680]  Jeff Williams expertise of operations where you can imagine
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:32.920]  how this feature came up. Somebody had the idea and they
[01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:35.800]  were like, wouldn't it be cool if you got a case looked the
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:39.800]  way that it does. Yeah. And somebody who heard that was
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:44.680]  like, you know, we could embed that engraving in the, yeah,
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:47.000]  absolutely. And then all of a sudden they're in touch with
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.120]  somebody and Jeff Williams team and all of a sudden they're
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.880]  talking in the factory and they're like, well, it's an all
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.840]  new case anyway, so we need a new production line and we could
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.160]  just add an extra step after the engraving is done. I'm
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:04.920]  imagining that they somehow flash it into the firmware.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.800]  You know, yeah, it's got to be in the, in the, in the cases
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:10.440]  firmware. Right. And that they just connect it to, or maybe
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.320]  it's already connected to a lightning cable as it moves down
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:16.600]  the line. And then after the engravings made at the same,
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:19.080]  maybe at the same time, they're flashing their engraving at
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.480]  they're also saying, Hey, now you're engraved with this.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.520]  Yeah. But that is a very fun feature and this is very much
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:27.080]  Apple. So did you, yours weren't engraved though, right?
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:30.040]  No, no. Cause the review units are just plain. So yeah. So you
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.360]  just, you've just seen this on Twitter or something. Yeah. It
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:35.880]  was a MacRumors head of story. I haven't seen this. My case
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.000]  does show up on screen exactly as it looks. It's just plain,
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.960]  plain plain case, right? Now I don't know what to do with my
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.680]  custom engraving. My custom engraving from my personal
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:50.440]  AirPods Pro first gen I'm very pleased with, but I don't, I
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:53.800]  don't think I want to duplicate it on the, on a, if I get myself
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:56.760]  a new pair because I want to be able to tell them apart and the
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.440]  engraving would be how I tell them apart.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:02.120]  What did you do for, what did, was the first one, did you
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:04.760]  manage to get a, like a dairy fireball looking star? Is that
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.240]  right?
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.080]  No, no. I looked at, I tried also. I spent a whole afternoon
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.960]  on it. Of course. Sure. No, I got, I got mine engraved with
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:15.720]  the words Jerk Store Brand.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.880]  Okay. Okay. And I included the brand because when you, when
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.440]  you made the string a little longer like that, it printed it
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.280]  in a smaller font, which I think looks better. Okay. So mine are
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.320]  Jerk Store Brand AirPods. AirPods. And it amuses me almost
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:37.560]  every day. I, no, that's great. I don't know. I make my, it's a
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.440]  joke that I find probably funnier than anybody else for
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:44.120]  some stupid reason, but in the way that you can be your own
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.920]  audience for your own joke, getting something funny
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.720]  engraved on your AirPods case is a good way to do it.
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:53.320]  No, that's, that's, I think I've told you this, but I like to,
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:56.040]  when I get something shipped to me and I can do a gift
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:55:00.360]  receipt, Past Paul sends Future Paul a little note. It's just,
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.800]  you know, they enjoy these new pants, Paul. It's the same
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.600]  kind of dumb, stupid thing that I enjoy and nobody else ever
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:07.560]  sees. And it's perfect.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.840]  Anyways, before we go, I wanted to congratulate you on 20
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:13.400]  years at Rogue Amoeba Software.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.920]  Well, thank you. I have to congratulate you as well for 20
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:20.040]  years because Daring Fireball started a month or two before
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.560]  we did. So we're both, we're both into our third decades now.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.920]  Serendipitous.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:25.720]  Absolutely.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:29.160]  So I did link and congratulate you at a nice post that you
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.560]  wrote. I would say it's fair to say, I think we talked about
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.800]  last time you were on the show earlier in the year, but Audio
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.000]  Hijack is your flagship product. You know, you love all
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.040]  of your products, but...
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:41.080]  Yeah, no, flagship, we've used that word for years, and I
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:43.400]  think it's a great word because it doesn't, it doesn't mean
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:46.440]  our best. It doesn't mean our most popular. It means like
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.200]  our most well-known, which is, I think, true anyway.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.560]  I don't know if you strategically planned to appeal to my
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.120]  desire to get two links in a row to the same thing and sneak
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.840]  in a speaking of, which I love to do. But you guys had a
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:05.640]  nice post talking about the redesign, the new design of
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.880]  Audio Hijack 4. One of the things, one of the changes in
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:14.520]  Audio Hijack 4 is that the icon is now a lot less fun.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.160]  I would agree, yes. I liked the old icon, but others within
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.040]  the company did not.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:27.080]  It's, but it's the way that people love, I've always said
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:33.080]  this, that people love to gripe and complain about app icons
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:33.560]  because...
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.520]  Oh, so much.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:40.600]  The stakes are so low and the definition is so concise,
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.080]  right? It is just one little picture that represents the
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:51.560]  app. And as much as all these other details of Audio Hijack
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:55.880]  are incredibly complicated user interface problems to
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.000]  solve, right? It's such a lovely app. I want to come back
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.840]  to the detail that goes into how intricate some of these
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:05.960]  things are. But basically, for anybody who hasn't used
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:08.600]  Audio Hijack, it is, well, how would you describe it?
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:12.040]  The simplest slogan is record any audio on your Mac. So
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:14.440]  an audio recorder for your Mac, but it does a whole lot
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:15.160]  more than that.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:20.440]  Right. So like for podcasts, you can have a session defined
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:26.200]  that takes your local microphone input on one path and
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.200]  maybe writes like an uncompressed WAV file out, but also
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.680]  takes the source input from the app you use like Skype or
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:39.000]  Zoom or FaceTime or whatever it is and records that on a
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.480]  different path. And you put these nodes into a session and
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:47.640]  they have a path that goes from here to here. And, you know,
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:50.440]  you've got so many features, but you can do things like
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:54.920]  filtering passes. You get as many output options as you
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.720]  want for writing it to a file. And it's described visually
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:03.560]  exactly like a flowchart. And there are so many complexities
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.360]  to that and the ways that you can do. And one of the neat
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:10.840]  new features, I think it's new, is the actual animation is
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:14.680]  definitely new. But like as it's actually running and you're
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.640]  doing the recording, there's this beautiful animation that
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.840]  shows the pathways that they're active because there's an
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.160]  animation showing it's going from your microphone to this
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.200]  WAV file. Anybody who really wanted to get into the
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.600]  intricacies of all of the user interface of Audio Hijack, I
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.320]  mean, we'd be here for another three hours talking about it.
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.120]  Whereas if we just want to complain about the trend of
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.880]  application icon design, boy, that's just a neat little,
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:43.720]  literally a button that you can focus a lot of attention on.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:47.720]  And that's what I sort of read in the post from Neil, your
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:49.880]  lead designer, only designer?
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.560]  Sole designer, but yeah, lead designer, sure.
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:55.880]  Yeah, give him the credit. It's an upbeat post to talk about
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.360]  all the things he's proud of in what's new in Audio Hijack.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.480]  And there's so much to talk about. I detected a bit of a
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:05.400]  sanguine note about the icon.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:10.040]  Well, it was something where, so I think the sort of, if
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:13.080]  there's any sadness to it, it's that I'm looking at it right
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:15.800]  now. The line was many of us inside of Rogue Amoeba lament
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.600]  the recent flattening of app icons on the Mac and the
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.160]  attendant loss of personality. And I think that summarizes
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.200]  it very well that Apple, geez, I can't even remember which
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:27.160]  version of OS X it was, but they basically iPhoneed the
[01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:30.440]  app icons and they flattened them all. This was two or three
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.600]  or four years ago at this point. I can't even keep track.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.120]  Yeah, it was coincident with the rise of, what's it called,
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:39.800]  where you can make your iPad app run on the Mac.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:40.680]  Catalyst, right.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.480]  And Apple doesn't like to explain itself, but it seems
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.280]  pretty obvious that they didn't want the catalyst apps that
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:48.920]  just had the iPad style icon to stick out.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:55.560]  So, to avoid that, they took the personality out of all of
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:58.200]  their system apps and made them all flat and made them all
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:02.120]  squirkels. And to your point, the old Audio Hijack 3 icon
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:06.440]  was a little bottle and it had a cork on top of it and it
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:09.640]  had a little level meter. And the idea that some people
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:11.720]  got, some people didn't, it didn't really matter if you
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:13.960]  didn't get it because it's just an app icon, but it's a
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:17.560]  bottle of audio because sound obviously has no visual to
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:20.760]  it. So, we had to come up with some way to represent audio.
[02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:23.400]  And this was like a potion jar that you'd see in like a
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.800]  wizard's workshop and you've captured this audio into a
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.880]  glass bottle. And that was the version 3 icon, which, as I
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:34.840]  said, some people loved, some people didn't really like,
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:38.920]  literally within the company. And the version 4 icon is a
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:42.440]  simpler squircle and we've got a microphone on there, so
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.080]  it's got a little bit more personality, but it's got a
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.320]  waveform. So, it's simpler than it used to be and it's not
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.600]  quite as fun, as you said.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:55.400]  Yeah, it looks right at home on the dock. And I think that's
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:59.000]  the big complaint. I can't speak inside the debate inside
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.840]  Rogue Amoeba. But what I've noticed overall in the three
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:06.440]  years or however long it's been since Apple sort of set
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:09.240]  the tone by changing all of its own first party apps to
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.320]  follow this style, that people who want other third party
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:18.680]  apps to follow this new flat squircle style will often say,
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:22.520]  I agree it doesn't look as cool, but it drives me crazy to
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.320]  have this one app in my dock that is different than all the
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.280]  others, right?
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.400]  That sticks out.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.880]  Right. I totally, I do get that, right? There is the, even
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:34.920]  when you disagree with the overall trend that Apple has
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:40.040]  set, that consistency still, there's merit to it even when
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.160]  you disagree with it.
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:46.600]  A lot of companies very rapidly updated their icons. I think
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:50.280]  Adobe did. And that was something where, to me, I only
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.240]  want to change an app icon at a major version. I don't want
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.840]  to just randomly change it because while the app icon
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:59.480]  doesn't matter that much, once you recognize it, you'll open
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.600]  the app, you'll be all set. I think changing it frequently
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:05.880]  or gratuitously is a negative because that's the face of
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:10.520]  that app that people most recognize. And so I was hesitant
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.520]  to do it. Several of our app icons still are not following
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.600]  that pattern, the Apple pattern. And for AudioHijack, which
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:22.040]  we only did that with version 4 because that felt like a
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.600]  time to make a change like that. So yeah, it was something
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:27.320]  where, as you said, definitely people say, oh, I just want
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.560]  them all to look the same and that'll be fine. And that's
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.400]  what I want, even though it's not as good. But we weren't
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:34.120]  willing to go that far with it. It's something where in the
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.080]  future, if we have another update, like Piezo has an icon
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.960]  that is not matching that style. If that has a major update,
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.520]  the icon might get changed. But before that, we're just
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.440]  going to leave it the way it is. And probably once a month,
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:47.320]  we get somebody upset about the icon and I can live with
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.560]  that. With the exception of stuff like t-shirts and the
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.720]  plush animated version of your mascot, the company mascot,
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:58.520]  the Amoeba, I'm trying to make an excuse here that you're
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:01.880]  totally a software company, but you've shipped hardware,
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.280]  technical hardware. Wow. Yeah, we've shipped merch, not
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.600]  actual hardware. Right. Right. Merch. So there is, software
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.400]  is such a weird thing. And effectively, I'm in the
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.600]  software business, right? What am I shipping? HTML and
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.680]  JavaScript? Everything's digital. Yeah. Right. It's just
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.400]  ones and zeros. Whether you're listening to my voice on this
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.600]  podcast or reading Daring Fireball, it's all ones and
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:27.400]  zeros going to you. And so it's weird to speak about
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.400]  packaging. But to me, that's one of the neat things about
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.800]  an application icon is it is the package for the whole app.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.520]  It is, it's the closest you get in software. Yeah, I think
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:42.120]  that's a good comparison. And so to me, I can't quite
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.480]  explain the thinking of why I think this way, but I feel it
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:49.240]  to my bones that an app should not do a major update to
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.200]  its icon unless there's a major update to the app itself.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:55.560]  I don't know why I feel that way. Yeah, no, and that's
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:59.000]  exactly how I felt about it. Right. You could tweak it a
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.360]  little. It is something where you recognize it, and that's
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:06.680]  good. Right. Well, and it's definitely, it's the functional
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.480]  purpose of the app icon is that you could recognize it in
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.360]  the dock or your command tab switcher or something like
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.240]  that. Right. So when you change that gratuitously, that's
[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:17.400]  you're causing people a little bit more friction for a
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:22.600]  while. So you talked about fun on the icon there. In that
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:24.920]  article that you mentioned, there are, that you linked to,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:28.120]  there are two notes of fun that I really liked. One was
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:31.640]  that the microphone is, it's got the year 2002 etched on
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:33.640]  it, representing the 20 years that we've been in business
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.720]  when the company started. But what I really liked that
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:38.600]  Neil and I worked on was that the waveform that it uses is
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:41.800]  just a simplified version of the word hijack. So nobody
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.880]  would ever know that unless we tell them, which is why
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:46.120]  I'm mentioning it. But we did, we did try to throw a little
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:48.600]  bit of whimsy in there and not have it be too devoid of
[02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:51.240]  personality. Yeah. And that's a funny little thing. I
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.800]  mean, I don't know if you tried other waveforms, you know,
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.800]  hijack is obviously a good one. It's fun that it came out
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.880]  as a pleasant looking waveform too, right? Like you write
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:04.680]  the shape of it, right? Like, so if you had the idea and you
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:06.760]  thought, maybe we should try saying the word hijack and
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:09.800]  make it a shape of that. And then you, you do it and the
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:13.080]  waveform for the word hijack looks stupid. You're like, ah,
[02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.560]  we need a better word, but it's fun that the word actually
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:19.880]  looks good. Then we got to find another word. Yep. So before
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.120]  the one thing I wanted to come back to was the, we were
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.840]  talking about subscriptions earlier and there was a stat
[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:28.200]  in your write up about the 20 years. We've shipped an
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:34.440]  astonishing 898 software releases since 2002 with 888 of
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:40.280]  those being free updates. That's 98.9%. So did we talk, I
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.200]  forget, did we talk about this the last time you were on the
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:46.120]  show, the subscription pricing trend in India? I mean, I've
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.000]  talked about this for years at this point, so it's possible,
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.880]  but well, we can podcasts are meant to repeat yourself. That
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.440]  means you've only had 10 paid upgrades in 20 years. I mean,
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:00.840]  somehow, if not, I've, I need to go back to basic arithmetic
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:06.120]  class, work on your math, but that's, that's sort of, I mean,
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:08.760]  I know that that's, I know rogue amoeba and I've been
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.560]  friends with you for a long time and following you became
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:15.480]  aware of you very early in the daring fireball era. And I
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:18.280]  known in the, and I've used, I use your products. So I know
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:22.920]  that paid upgrades are few and far between, but that's fewer
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:26.760]  and further between than I would have thought for a
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:32.280]  successful, continually thriving software concern. The fact
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.840]  that we're, we're only now at the 20th anniversary talking
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:39.480]  about audio hijack four, right? There's a lot of other, a lot
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:44.760]  of other apps gain inversion numbers at a higher rate than
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:50.760]  getting to four in 20 years. Well, so, so that I can,
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.000]  Audio Hijack Pro 2 lasted for, I just, I was just talking
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:59.400]  about this, it lasted for 11 years and like 2.5 really
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:02.840]  should have been three. And I think like 2.7 also had a
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:05.480]  major feature or two that could have made it version three
[02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:08.440]  or version four. So we were definitely a little stingy, I
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.000]  think, with, with version numbers in part because we had
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.280]  the idea that we've pretty much followed. There may be one
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:16.440]  or two exceptions, but basically if it gets a new version
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:19.880]  number, that will be a paid upgrade. And so our version
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:21.880]  numbers have not gone up that much because we have not had
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:24.840]  that many paid upgrades. So the, the obvious first question
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.120]  is, have we left money on the table? And the answer is
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.440]  probably yes. It's almost certainly yes. We have a pretty
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.000]  good article on our website and it's called Our Upgrade
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.480]  Philosophy. It's not our upgrade policy, it's our
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:38.600]  philosophy on what upgrades should be. And I don't remember
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.920]  the exact wording I wrote this years ago, but it's basically
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:44.360]  bug fix updates are free. We don't charge for OS updates.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:48.280]  If we need to support a new OS, to this point, we have not
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:50.840]  charged just for that. But when we add substantial new
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:53.720]  functionality, that is making the product better and that's
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.880]  something that you should have to pay for and it's fair to
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:59.160]  charge for and it's fair for you to have to pay for it. And
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.240]  so that's, that's sort of how we've thought about it from
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:03.560]  the get-go was that if there's, if there's going to be major
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:06.040]  new functionality, we'll charge for that. But when we do
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:08.920]  smaller updates, we'll provide that for free and it adds
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.560]  value to the product and it makes it more reasonable to
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:15.400]  charge a fair price from the beginning. So, you know, when
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:18.040]  I look at that number, I wrote this and I did the math and
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:19.640]  I looked at that number and I said, yeah, we probably
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:22.600]  should have charged for a few more of those upgrades and
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:25.080]  made a little bit more money. But at the same time, we get
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.320]  a ton of people who say, oh, I've been using this for years
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:30.760]  and it's great and I tell all my friends. And when the new
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.680]  version does come out that's a paid upgrade, they say, you
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:34.920]  know, I bought it immediately. I knew that there was going
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:38.440]  to be good value there. And I didn't have to be convinced
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.920]  to upgrade. So I don't need to, we don't need to ring every
[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.720]  single penny that we can out of this. I try and run a good
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.440]  business and we've been, as you said, thriving for 20
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:51.240]  years. But if there's a little bit more money we could be
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.120]  making by annoying people by charging more often, to this
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.520]  point, we've been content with the paid upgrades that we've
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.400]  had. And with the other thing is that, especially when we
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:02.440]  started, there were millions upon millions, tens of millions
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.200]  of Mac users, and almost none of them had our product. And
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.400]  at this point, there's tens of millions of Mac users and
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:12.360]  still hundreds of thousands or a few million, a couple
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:15.480]  million have our products. But we have complimentary
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:18.760]  products, we have paid upgrades, and we still have a huge
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.960]  swath of people that can find our products and purchase
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:24.440]  them for the first time and hopefully see that there's a
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:27.640]  lot of value there. So it's something where even if we hit
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:30.920]  10% of Mac users, there's still a huge number of people
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:33.320]  out there who aren't using our products and can be new
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.400]  customers. And that's where we've, our initial prices are
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.960]  not super expensive. They're not hundreds of dollars, but
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.000]  they're not cut rate pricing. So I think we've always tried
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.640]  to charge a fair price and then have a fair upgrade policy.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.840]  But if we haven't optimized for getting every single penny
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:50.600]  we could, I'm okay with that, because we've been doing
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.240]  pretty well.
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:54.120]  Yeah, it's hard to, I was gonna say it's hard to put a price
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.000]  on customer loyalty. And I would say, I guess it's
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.640]  impossible. You can't really assign a direct price. There's
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.320]  no way to make a column in a spreadsheet where you've,
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:07.880]  you've pegged the exact value of loyalty that somebody
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:11.400]  had loyalty, right? Somebody who's been a user of your
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.920]  product since 18 years ago or something like that. This
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.760]  person has upgraded three times because there have been
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:22.200]  three paid upgrades over that time. They appreciate the
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:24.920]  fact that they, they know that they're getting a significant
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.640]  new version when they upgrade and the old version isn't
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.520]  going to just stop working, right? There's always a limit
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:33.240]  to how, how long an old version is going to keep working.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:35.320]  And there's all sorts of transitions that are outside
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.240]  your control, like the move to Apple Silicon and, and going
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:42.680]  back, you know, just OS updates in general. Yeah, right.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:46.040]  64-bit transition and all of a sudden 32-bit versions of
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.600]  apps, you know, instead of getting a recommendation to ask
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.160]  the developer for an update, they just stop working, right?
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:56.120]  All of a sudden it just doesn't work. So there's things
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:59.080]  like that, but for the most part, the traditional way of
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.360]  selling software to customers and making a business out of
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:06.040]  creating third-party applications is here's the price.
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:10.520]  And when we come out with a new version, we'll have an
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:14.600]  upgrade price for existing users. And if you like the
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.000]  sounds of it, you could try it, but install the new version
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.080]  and see if you like the new features. And if you like it,
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.240]  buy it. And if you want to stick with your old version,
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.040]  you can stick with it for some amount of time. But that,
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:28.360]  that way of selling software is definitely, I'm not saying
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:31.960]  it's going away, but it has so clearly been, it's not the
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:37.800]  norm now, right? It's, are you worried that it, like, I know
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:40.760]  that you like this method of software. And I know that there
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:43.720]  are a lot of users out there who prefer buying their
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.440]  software this way. But is there, has it occurred to you
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.120]  that as the, as the industry moves on and subscription
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.320]  pricing becomes the norm, that people will start thinking
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.920]  your software is priced weirdly?
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:59.400]  I mean, so subscription pricing for software is, has been
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.560]  fairly mainstream for, I don't know what I want to say,
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:04.520]  at least five years. And longer before that, Adobe and
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:06.920]  Microsoft were trying to do it and people really hated it.
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:09.960]  But it, they stuck with it and businesses loved it because
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.680]  they could say, oh, I'm not making a new purchase. I'm just
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.880]  subscribing to Photoshop for 50 bucks a month. And they
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.800]  don't have to justify anything. You just put it on a credit
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.600]  card and it goes forever. And so there were a lot of
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.680]  reasons why that took off. But for, for a good long period
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:26.760]  of that time, people were saying, oh, this is one way you
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:30.920]  can do it. And it's, it's, maybe you should consider it.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:33.960]  And I feel like that's still the case is that if you're in
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.080]  the App Store, especially on iOS, you can't have a free
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.600]  trial. So you need to have a low price up front or no price
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:44.760]  up front, and then collect money after the fact, often with
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.160]  a subscription. On the Mac, we can say, you know what, you
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:49.560]  don't need to pay anything up front. It's zero dollars.
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:53.160]  Try it out. You'll be able to use every single feature. And
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:56.280]  then if you realize that this is useful for you, you'll pay,
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:59.480]  you know, not two dollars, you're going to pay 50 bucks.
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:01.160]  But you're only going to pay that once and it's going to
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.360]  work for months or years before you're ever going to need
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.680]  to pay again. And so I like the model, as you said. Am I
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.080]  worried that people will think it's strange or not
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.000]  understand it? I mean, I wasn't until you mentioned it. But
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.960]  I think it's something, I think it's something where we have
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.800]  the ability, if everybody went to subscriptions and we were
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:24.760]  the last ones not doing it and people said, oh, why am I
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.880]  paying 50 bucks up front? I just want to pay three bucks and
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:31.320]  I'll use it for 10 months or I'll use it for 20 months. If
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  I use it for 20 months, you're going to make even more money
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:35.480]  than you would have. At a certain point, we might say,
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:39.000]  okay, we need to switch to this method. But right now, it is
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.680]  not the case that people are terribly confused. It's not the
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.080]  case that people don't understand paying for an upgrade.
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:48.040]  There's, as you said, it's an older style of selling
[02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:51.240]  software and the company is 20 years old. And in 2002, this
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.280]  was the way to sell software on the web. You make a version,
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.600]  you sell it, and then you have a discounted upgrade later and
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.840]  get some additional revenue from people who are already
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:03.080]  using it. Now, it's not as common, but it still works, is
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:06.840]  what I would say. And we have talked about and kicked around
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.160]  the idea of subscription pricing for years. And every day
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:13.560]  we get people who say, oh, thank you for having a one-time
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.520]  purchase and I don't want to have another subscription. So
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:19.880]  that's indicative of the idea that not everyone wants this.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:22.680]  It's not something that everyone thinks we're doing wrong. In
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.360]  terms of making more revenue or in terms of eventually being
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.880]  so weird that people don't get it, it's possible, but I'm not
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:31.960]  worried that we can't transition if we need to.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.240]  Yeah, that makes sense. And I do think, too, that this method,
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.040]  the traditional method of selling versions that the
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:41.080]  customer owns a license to for years to come and gets to
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:44.440]  choose whether they upgrade at a loyalty discount, for lack of a
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.920]  better word, when a major new version comes out years down
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:53.240]  the road. More and more, the apps that are left are
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.680]  professional tools. I mean, I suppose that if you put games
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:01.880]  aside, well, then what are any of the apps people have been
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:05.400]  using on the Mac for years, 30, 40 years, right? We're almost,
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:11.240]  we're 38 years into the Mac. Well, of course, the software
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:14.280]  people pay for is more likely to be something that is, quote,
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.440]  unquote, a professional tool.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:19.720]  Something that's making them money or that they're using at
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:20.440]  a job, yeah.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:25.000]  Right. But it just seems more like this is, my job depends on
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  this, and I like buying my tools.
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:30.760]  Yep. Yeah, no, I think that's right. Yeah, like a carpenter
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:32.120]  isn't renting a hammer.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:34.360]  Right. I've seen that analogy.
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.120]  He's buying a saw and he uses it.
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:40.520]  I generally prefer your method just because I tend to, the
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:44.360]  software I tend to buy, I use for years and years. BB Edit and
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:48.040]  Mars Edit and Audio Hijacked, a lot of the apps I use on the
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:51.080]  Mac, the stuff from Omni Group are apps that have been around
[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:54.920]  for decades plus, or decades, like in the Omni Group's case,
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:57.560]  or now in your case, right? It's decades.
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.280]  BB Edit, yeah.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:01.160]  Right. And BB Edit goes back to 1992.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:06.920]  And so I prefer it, but I'm also ambivalent about it.
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:08.680]  I see which way the trend is going.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.160]  And I know how it's nicer to have regular monthly revenue
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:16.600]  than big bursts of revenue when you have a major update.
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  And you guys, I understand you run a tight ship over there
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:26.920]  as the CEO and co-founder, but the one problem, some
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:29.080]  companies, and we don't have to throw anybody under the bus,
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:31.560]  but some companies have gotten in trouble over the years
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:36.920]  where if your business model is that you only sell to your
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.440]  existing base when there's a major new update and you've
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:44.840]  sort of saturated the market or close to it where upgrade
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:49.080]  revenue is way more important than, or is at least essential
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:52.040]  to the company's business compared to brand new license
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:58.120]  sales. And a major upgrade gets delayed in engineering, right?
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.960]  It was supposed to come out in the summer.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:04.440]  Here we are six months later, and now it's starting to look
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:07.880]  like maybe next summer is a question mark, right?
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:11.560]  That we really underestimated this or that engineering
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:16.520]  challenge. Companies have gotten in trouble in that case.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:21.080]  As long as you've still got people who aren't canceling
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.720]  their subscriptions, if people are just paying every month,
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:25.160]  it's much more regular.
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.880]  No, it's certainly something that I definitely see that
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:32.600]  downside. And as you said, we've seen that happen and it
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.480]  has caused companies to go out of business even. But for us,
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:38.520]  the upgrade revenue has never been, we've only had these 10
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:41.160]  upgrades that we've charged for. So obviously, it can't be
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.200]  too much of our business. It's two things. As I said early on,
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:48.920]  it can't be that important, right? As I said early on, we've
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.040]  been able to grow the customer base just because the Mac has
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.720]  been getting larger and we started out very small. But the
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:00.120]  other thing is that we have a lineup of audio products. And
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:04.680]  so when we made Loopback, for instance, we advertised that
[02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:08.040]  to all of our users and a ton of them said, oh, that is a
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:11.400]  utility I can use. And they bought that for full price. I
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:13.640]  think we might have had a small discount, but it wasn't an
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:16.600]  upgrade. It was a brand new product. And now they own two
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:20.280]  of our products. And over the years, we'll have twice as many
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.800]  upgrades because it's over owning just one of them. So it's
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.360]  something where having complementary products has been
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:29.800]  really useful in terms of generating more revenue. And the
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:33.160]  other thing is we've only ever grown organically. Instead of
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.960]  saying, oh, we want to be twice the size we are now, let's just
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.120]  ramp up and hire people and then we'll need to find the
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:41.160]  revenue. We've said, okay, we've got enough excess revenue
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.600]  that we can hire a new person to either make a new product or
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:47.400]  develop this one further than we've been able to do so far.
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.640]  And obviously, that's limiting. We're never going to be
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:52.760]  Facebook, Uber, some giant software company, but it has
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.600]  served us pretty well. And we're more than a lifestyle company
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.960]  where someone just is making just enough money to live their
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:03.400]  life. And we've got employees, we've had a double digit staff
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.360]  for many years now. And it's worked pretty well. And again,
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:08.280]  like I said, if we've left some money on the table, that's
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:11.480]  okay. But we've been fortunate enough to not make any huge
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:14.680]  mistakes where we were having a revenue gap that we needed to
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.320]  worry about.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:21.160]  Yeah, the other thing I'll just before we call it a show is it
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.960]  no longer even seems to be a topic of conversation amongst a
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:30.920]  lot of indie Mac companies I know of, of whether or not
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:35.080]  they're even going to try another attempt at iPhone
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.760]  software, or iPad software for that call. Gosh, and I'm just
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.520]  curious where, where you see that at right where in the early
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:45.880]  days of the iPhone to make a very long story very short, when
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:49.400]  they first said, Hey, this is the new iPhone is it is iPhone
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:54.440]  and it's built on OS 10. And it uses cocoa. And it looks so
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:59.080]  cool. And it was at the height of indie Mac software having
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:03.720]  sort of the likable user interfaces. And here's a device
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:06.440]  where it looks even better than on the Mac, because the screen
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:10.360]  is as smaller pixels. And there was so much enthusiasm of now
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:13.400]  we can, instead of making Mac software, we'll make iPhone
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:16.920]  software too. And if the iPhone is more popular than the Mac,
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:20.680]  which is funny to think, it was a question at any time, right?
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:24.840]  It could be huge, right? And Steve Jobs, when he introduced
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:26.840]  it was like, I think, you know, we're going to try to sell 10
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:29.240]  million in our second year. And it's like, well, that would be
[02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:32.280]  a lot of phones at a time when Apple I think around that time,
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:36.200]  they were selling like 2 million Macs a quarter. So he was
[02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:39.960]  already thinking that the iPhone might in its second year, out
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:43.560]  sell the Mac in units. And it's like, Oh, this is this exciting
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:47.000]  new frontier. There are obviously a lot of people whose
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.880]  career for a decade plus has been making iOS software. But
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:55.800]  it doesn't seem like it's in the style. Nobody even really
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:21:00.280]  talks about it anymore of indie Mac, or indie iPhone software
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:03.320]  tools like Rogomedia developers. Yeah, indie developers.
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:08.840]  I mean, the one, the obvious one that comes to mind for me is
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:12.520]  Omni group, because they have iOS versions of most of their
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:16.360]  products, right? Yeah, we in 2008, when you could start
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:19.880]  selling an iPhone app, we made a version of one of our
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:23.560]  products. And we tried to sell it for $10, which was way
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:26.280]  cheaper than anything we had on the Mac at the time where
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:30.840]  everything was $20, $30, $40, $50. And despite the fact that
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:34.360]  the iPhone had millions upon millions of users, none of them
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:38.280]  wanted to pay $10 for a product, especially that they couldn't
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.600]  use without paying for it. They couldn't try it out first.
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:45.160]  So very early on, we were dissuaded from much iOS
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:48.200]  development. And then over the years, just dealing with
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.480]  various App Store challenges and product review challenges,
[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:54.360]  submission reviews that Apple does, and it scared us away
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:58.920]  from it. And the Mac never saw a downturn on the Mac where
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:01.320]  people, it's not something where people said, Oh, I'm not
[02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:04.040]  buying software on the Mac anymore. I'm using the iPhone.
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:05.720]  It's something where people said, Oh, I'm using both of
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:09.320]  these things. So the Mac was still a profitable place to be
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.200]  making software. And it was a place where you could say this
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:15.400]  piece of software is deep, and it has a whole lot of
[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:18.360]  functionality and you're going to use it a lot. And therefore
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:22.360]  it should cost $50 or $100 because it is deep. And because
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.600]  we can give you a trial of it and you can say, you know what,
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:27.560]  I am going to use this. This is worth that kind of outlay in
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:30.840]  terms of cash. On the iPhone, we tried to make a relatively
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:33.800]  deep application, much shallower than our Mac apps, but
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:37.240]  certainly deeper than a lot of iPhone apps. And we priced it
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:41.000]  accordingly. And $10 was a fairly high price. And it just
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  didn't get any traction because that price was too high. I
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.200]  mean, I think going back to Vesper, you can relate to this
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:49.960]  somewhat that that was a more in-depth app than a lot of apps
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:53.880]  out there. And what was the price range on that? Did it go
[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:55.640]  from like $3 to $10 over time?
[02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:59.480]  $2.99 to $4.99, I think. I forget what the highest was.
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:01.160]  Okay. So $3 to $5.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:06.760]  It kind of hovered in the $3 to $5 range. But even that is
[02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:08.120]  expensive for the iPhone.
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:11.240]  Yeah. And we really do a lot of volume too.
[02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:15.240]  Yeah. We really figured out. I mean, I don't want to turn this
[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:19.240]  into a whole side note about Vesper, but the timing in
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:24.520]  hindsight was terrible because it was right at the cusp of when
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:29.800]  subscription pricing was going to be, was going to become a
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:33.160]  thing. And that's how you do iPhone apps, but it wasn't there
[02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:39.480]  yet. And yet the, the, we don't have deep analytics. You don't
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:42.360]  get deep analytics like this, but it was pretty clear. What
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.600]  was happening in hindsight is that when people were looking
[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:48.360]  for a notes app on the app store, they would start by
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:51.080]  installing the ones that were free, whether they had in-app
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:54.600]  purchases or not. But if you could install it for free, they
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:58.440]  would start by installing the ones for free. And then at some
[02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:01.080]  point they'd either find one that they thought was good
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:04.920]  enough, or they would just give up, but they never got to the
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:07.560]  point where they're like, well, let me try this one with all
[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:11.880]  the good ratings that looks really cool for $5. It's like
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:12.840]  they never got there.
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.600]  That lack of trials, I think it's still there. The alternative
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:19.400]  is you have a free version with in-app purchase, but I always
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.880]  point to that on the Mac that I can say we can charge a
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:25.000]  reasonable price because you get a chance to try it out
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.960]  before you ever put down any money. And I don't, I mean,
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:30.520]  like, I don't want to buy an app on the iPhone for $10
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.360]  unless I get a recommendation from a friend, or I can play
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.320]  with it on their phone is even better. But if there's a free
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:39.560]  alternative, that is the one I'm going to try. And I'm
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:42.520]  someone who sells software. So I have no problem paying for
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:44.600]  software, but I have a problem paying when I can't try it out
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:45.240]  first.
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:47.320]  Right. Well, and the other difference between people like
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:50.120]  me and you and even everybody who probably listens to my
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.520]  show here is we follow other sources of information like,
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:58.520]  Oh, I saw Gruber mentioned a new Mercury weather app on
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:02.200]  Daring Fireball. So I'll check it out. Right. Exactly. Whereas
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:05.960]  the to really be that that market isn't big enough, though,
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:09.160]  the number of people who would come to a new rogue Amoeba
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:13.160]  iPhone app just by reading Jason Snell's coverage of it and
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.800]  John Gruber's coverage of it. You too many people just go to
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:20.920]  the App Store and the App Store is their recommendation engine
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:23.640]  and the App Store was telling people you should try this for
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:26.440]  all these free apps first. I mean, effectively telling them
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:29.080]  that. And I know that's counterintuitive because every
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.120]  you know, Apple's in so much regulatory pressure right now
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:36.680]  over the 30 and 15% cuts they take of the money. Obviously,
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:40.600]  Apple likes to make money from the their control and their
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.680]  revenue cut of the App Store. But so it's not that they were
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.080]  telling people explicitly, don't buy, don't pay for apps in the
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:52.920]  App Store. But implicitly, that was the message you still get
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:57.240]  from the App Store experience. You type notes app, and you see
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:02.200]  these some options say install and others say buy and I'd
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:05.240]  rather install something for free than buy it before trying.
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:09.080]  Absolutely. Yeah. The other advantage you guys have is by
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:13.160]  by eking out this ownership, not ownership exclusively, but
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:16.360]  you know that you guys make audio apps. I mean, you know,
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.200]  who knows, maybe someday you'll come out with something that's
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:22.120]  not an audio app. But now but we have a niche. Right. And
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:25.160]  you're known for it. It's easier to cross sell, right? You
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:27.960]  mentioned we didn't mention for ago, but it's frog is your
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.080]  soundboard app. And so I don't put gimmicky sounds on my
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.880]  podcast. But if I did, I know that I would use for ago to do
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:36.360]  it, right? It's why I wouldn't even look at anything else. And
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:38.840]  that you could cross out that you've got so many people who
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:42.280]  were doing things where that app makes sense, who were already
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:45.720]  using audio hijack or something else that you're semi
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:49.080]  occasional, don't abuse the mailing list, mailing message
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:51.560]  would say, Hey, we've got a soundboard app now. That's
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:54.840]  like, Oh, well, I love your other app. So I'll buy that or
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:58.200]  I'll at least try it. Absolutely. Yeah, there's there's
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:01.320]  huge value there. Yeah. And the other thing too, about having
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:07.560]  this audio niche is there's no compatibility story between the
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  devices. So like, all right, I'm using audio hijack. And it's
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:15.080]  how I record my podcasts. And it's a very important tool to
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:18.760]  me. I don't need access to audio hijack on my phone, right?
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:22.040]  Because I don't do the podcast recording on my phone. And so
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:26.200]  there's no interrupt, whereas that I'm not even saying it's a
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.800]  problem for the Omni group. But you could see with their apps,
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:33.960]  people are like, Well, I need my to do list on my phone too.
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.360]  And I needed my iPad, I keep my whole brain in Omni outliner.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:41.160]  And I need that I when I have a new idea that I want to add to
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:45.480]  my outline, I got to do it from my phone. And so again, I'm not
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.760]  saying they absolutely had to, but you could see how with their
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:53.240]  apps, and the sort of things people do with their apps, the
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.680]  idea that people would only still be using them on their Mac
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.520]  was probably that they probably were right, that they had to
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:03.560]  fully embrace iPhone and iPad OS multiple platforms for it.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.720]  Yeah, no, and our tools are much more of a sit down at your Mac
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:10.680]  and use them and you'll get an audio file, which you can do
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:13.560]  whatever you want with. But yeah, you don't need to have it
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:16.680]  on your on your phone or your iPad. Yeah, that's exactly it.
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:21.000]  Your interop format is the audio file that gets produced by the
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.640]  various tools and they just work. You can just take weld it
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.000]  emits mp3 file one that you could play the mp3 file on your
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.880]  phone. That's probably what you wanted to do. Yep. All right.
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.720]  I'm gonna call it a wrap. Thanks, Paul.
[02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:38.040]  Can I just can I can I throw my plug in for you? Of course,
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:40.920]  mentioned, you mentioned owning the audio space and whether we
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:44.760]  own it or not, we do own the domain macaudio.com, which is
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:48.680]  which is where people should go to to to find our product. So I
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:51.480]  like having that domain because it at least makes it seem like
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:55.240]  we own the audio space. And I think we have mentioned that
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:58.920]  before, but you do like to macaudio.com and then it gets
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:01.960]  you out of anybody's confusion over to how to spell the word.
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:04.760]  How to spell rogue or amoeba. Yeah. Which one do you think is
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:09.320]  more is more misspelled? Well, misspelled in terms of getting
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:12.840]  to us amoeba, because amoeba has three different, at least
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:16.840]  three different valid spellings. And I don't I don't remember
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:19.480]  which of them we own. We own the one that we use, but I'm not
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:22.200]  even sure we own either of the other common spellings of it.
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:25.000]  So yeah, amoeba is definitely the the more problematic of the
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.560]  two, I think. Yeah, I think if you really wanted to cover all
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.400]  of your possible bases for misspellings of rogue amoeba.com,
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:35.240]  you'd have to you'd need at least 20. Yeah, it's it's it's
[02:29:35.240 --> 02:29:38.360]  double digits domains. Yeah, exactly. Anything else you
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:40.280]  wanted to mention? I think we've I think we've covered it,
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:43.160]  though. Congrats on 20 years. I'll at least have you on once
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:47.880]  more before you get to 30 years. Okay, I appreciate that sometime
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:50.200]  in the next 10 years. Yeah, sometime in the next 10 years. I
[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:53.880]  will have you back on the show. No, no, it's I mean, I'm glad to
[02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:56.440]  be on. I appreciate it. And it's been fun celebrating this a
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:58.840]  little bit. The best thing is that it's made people talk
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:00.760]  about how they use the products. And that's the most
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:03.000]  interesting thing to me is that, you know, we make these
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.200]  products and we have an idea of how they'll be used. But we've
[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:09.320]  heard from hundreds of different podcasts that said, oh,
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:11.800]  congratulations, I couldn't make my podcast without you.
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.160]  It's a podcast I've never heard of on some topic I've never
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:18.520]  even thought of. And it's it's very cool to be a part of
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.480]  something without without even knowing it and and to finally
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:24.920]  see that. So that's it's just been really interesting to see
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:27.560]  so much feedback from people. Yeah, that's it's always one of
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:30.440]  the best parts about making tools is that if it's a tool of
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.440]  any kind, creative people are going to find ways that the
[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:38.200]  toolmaker never thought never thought would have been a use
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:31:04.760]  case, but they're going to find them. Absolutely.
