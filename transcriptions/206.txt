[00:00.000 --> 00:07.880]  I will just say this my Sixers are coming on. I'm gonna be a Sixers fan. I like this young team. Yeah, it's it's unfortunate the
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.400]  Unfortunate that they're doing well
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.600]  No, so the the Milwaukee Bucks have had 20 years of just incompetent ownership and bad bad
[00:15.600 --> 00:19.080]  but so the big problem with the Bucks in a nutshell is a
[00:20.680 --> 00:22.860]  Focusing too much on like the near term and not enough
[00:22.860 --> 00:26.240]  I'm like having a long term plan like that's been that it's always what's next
[00:26.240 --> 00:30.080]  Let's let's optimize for this coming year and you end up making decisions and doing something
[00:30.080 --> 00:35.000]  So you're not building for the future and the problem is they have this superstar and it's been clear is gonna be a superstar
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.240]  for a while and
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.360]  And it's like well finally can we actually build for the future instead of always building for next year?
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.320]  And of course over the last three summers that hasn't really happened and then this past summer
[00:44.960 --> 00:49.120]  our GM job opened for for various complicated reasons and
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.200]  We had this terrible process with ownership fighting with each other also
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.520]  We end up promoting like this told this like random guy who'd been the front office for like ten years in the middle
[00:57.520 --> 01:00.320]  And who'd been there for all kinds of bad decisions, you know
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.080]  He's not the GM and all that aside at the press conference the owner who?
[01:06.120 --> 01:07.600]  hired him
[01:07.600 --> 01:12.520]  Whether or not he had the agreement the other owners questionable which goes back to the team's kind of inherent dysfunction
[01:12.640 --> 01:16.200]  But he said something the effect of well those guys in Philadelphia talked about the process
[01:16.200 --> 01:23.920]  and what we care about here is results and it was like it was painful because that's always been the problem of the Bucks is
[01:24.040 --> 01:27.560]  focusing on near-term results and not thinking about the process and
[01:28.560 --> 01:33.840]  The whole point of what Philadelphia's gone through the past few years is to have be in this position where they have multiple
[01:34.800 --> 01:39.440]  like potential stars going forward and and then
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  Hilariously just to kind of bring it home. They now have a better record and a better point differential in the Bucks this year
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  So if you care about results, then it's also not so great and it's not looking great going forward
[01:50.000 --> 01:50.720]  so I mean
[01:50.720 --> 01:51.560]  So, you know
[01:51.560 --> 01:56.600]  The reason I go is because the Sixers and the Celtics are the queer sort of and Bucks are kind of the queer
[01:56.880 --> 01:59.680]  class of the Eastern Conference once LeBron leaves and
[02:00.280 --> 02:06.160]  Both those teams are in a much better place than the Bucks are because they focus on process and not results anyhow
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.120]  It's it's frustrating but we have Yanis and he's amazing and and so we'll just you know
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.440]  and as always we'll just have to cross our fingers and hope for the best because
[02:17.240 --> 02:18.760]  There's not
[02:18.760 --> 02:22.040]  There there's not a process. That's that's easy to see
[02:25.440 --> 02:26.840]  Sixers are winning
[02:26.840 --> 02:32.280]  Sixers have a strange history where the Sixers their their quote-unquote process was to purposefully lose his I mean
[02:32.280 --> 02:34.280]  this is gonna sound crazy to people in Europe who
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.940]  maybe aren't familiar with US sports and
[02:37.480 --> 02:41.480]  Especially the NBA but it was the Sixers decided it was to their
[02:41.480 --> 02:47.860]  strategic benefit to lose as many games possible for about three or four years to rack up high draft picks and then
[02:48.340 --> 02:53.740]  Even as they were accumulating those draft picks lose until they felt like they had a good enough team to try to start winning
[02:54.300 --> 02:59.700]  And it was no that's it. What's that's exactly what I mean the thing with basketball is in basketball
[03:00.340 --> 03:04.380]  Having a great having great players matters more than any other sport
[03:04.380 --> 03:04.780]  Yeah
[03:04.780 --> 03:09.700]  because there's there's only five players on the court and the the level of
[03:09.700 --> 03:14.740]  differentiation like there's a lot of like sort of replacement level players and there's a fair number of like
[03:14.740 --> 03:19.180]  You know decent guys, but the guys that actually matter that actually move the needle
[03:19.180 --> 03:22.740]  There's like five or six of them in the league or you may be ten at most
[03:22.740 --> 03:23.220]  and
[03:23.220 --> 03:29.100]  and so to you have to have at least one to win like the history the NBA shows that and you probably have to have
[03:29.100 --> 03:35.140]  Two and the thing with the NBA is the number of teams that have won championships is remarkably limited
[03:35.140 --> 03:41.380]  Like only about half the team has ever won period right and I think five of the teams account for 70% of the championships
[03:42.020 --> 03:47.740]  And it's because they've had the best players and you know the Lakers the Bulls the the Celtics and and and the Warriors
[03:48.780 --> 03:50.780]  and the problem is
[03:51.260 --> 03:54.180]  Once you have the best players you have the best players for like, you know
[03:54.180 --> 03:59.460]  Seven to eight years and and you're gonna rack up rack up titles and it's it's a very unbek
[03:59.460 --> 04:06.140]  It's an inherently unbalanced sport just because the best player matters so much more than any other sport. Yep
[04:07.540 --> 04:10.860]  It's funny. I don't know if I mean you're really really tuned in the NBA
[04:10.860 --> 04:15.620]  So you might be aware of this but the Sixers right now, even though they're still not really a top-tier team
[04:15.620 --> 04:17.020]  They're just a winning team
[04:17.020 --> 04:21.760]  With with their best years ahead of them a winning team with young players with their best years ahead of them
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.340]  The Philadelphia 76ers right now are a tougher ticket and play before a fuller house
[04:27.340 --> 04:35.420]  than any previous Sixers team ever including the Iverson era teams and the well the one that's most surprising is the
[04:36.340 --> 04:38.260]  Absolutely, great
[04:38.260 --> 04:43.500]  Dr. J era teams from the early 80s. Yeah. Well, it's funny because I it's almost a reap
[04:43.500 --> 04:48.460]  I think it's gonna be a repeat of the 80s where if you're if you recall back the Celtics won the most
[04:48.460 --> 04:54.100]  But the Sixers beat them sometimes and then the Bucks always lost in the second round of the playoffs to one of those two teams
[04:54.100 --> 04:58.660]  And it's it's shaping up to be like a direct replay of the 80s, which is very depressing
[04:58.660 --> 05:02.880]  I mean, I actually do think the Bucks will have the best player of all three teams
[05:03.100 --> 05:03.940]  but again
[05:03.940 --> 05:09.020]  It's the it's the supporting cast and and both the Celtics and the Sixers are shaping up to have multiple
[05:09.460 --> 05:13.100]  top players in the way, you know, the the Bucks are not and
[05:14.060 --> 05:18.540]  and that's the other thing with the NBA that's really tricky is the NBA because of the salary cap and
[05:18.540 --> 05:26.060]  Contracts are guaranteed you to get to line up the salaries is really difficult because what happens is once your best player
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.540]  On the rookie deal
[05:27.540 --> 05:32.620]  So the NBA is all about you have to get access value you get access value by having rookies because there's a pay scale
[05:32.620 --> 05:37.060]  And so you have to get a rookie that produces about his pay scale and max guys. There's max contracts
[05:37.280 --> 05:41.000]  The best players are worth so much more than their max contract
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.700]  And so there's there but the problem is all those guys in the middle guys who aren't on rookie deals and who aren't max players
[05:46.700 --> 05:52.380]  you will at best pay them what they're worth and so the problem is that where teams get in trouble like the Bucks is they
[05:52.380 --> 05:54.540]  Pay too many guys what they're worth or overpay them
[05:54.740 --> 05:59.080]  And and they don't have enough on those two extremes where they're generating excess value
[05:59.080 --> 06:04.100]  and so part of the trick of the whole tanking you want to take multiple years in a row is you want to have all
[06:04.100 --> 06:06.100]  these guys in the same sort of
[06:06.100 --> 06:10.740]  The same level as far as income goes because the other thing is once you have a great player
[06:10.780 --> 06:16.620]  You can't get another great player because one you don't have the space and and great players rarely become available in free agency
[06:16.620 --> 06:22.020]  Until like their 10th year in the season when they're declining and and to you're too good to get a good draft pick
[06:22.020 --> 06:25.020]  And so you have to like you the timing is really really tricky
[06:25.020 --> 06:30.960]  It really does take a five to ten year plan to build a team to sort of like have one just happened
[06:30.960 --> 06:36.920]  It just doesn't work that way which is exactly how the NFL works our Football League where that you know
[06:37.340 --> 06:42.540]  Atlanta Falcons are struggling they were in the Super Bowl last year and every year there's always like one or two teams in the
[06:42.540 --> 06:48.740]  playoffs who who were like awful the year before but they just make one or two of the right moves in the offseason and
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.940]  Anyway, anyway, that's enough sports. We got real stuff to talk about
[06:55.740 --> 07:00.100]  Now I got follow-up though I have follow-up from previous episodes this is important stuff
[07:00.100 --> 07:03.420]  So this is episode 206 episode 203
[07:03.420 --> 07:08.580]  so three episodes go Serenity Caldwell was on and I was talking about how I ran into
[07:08.580 --> 07:14.580]  To me the crazily arbitrarily arbitrary limit of 100 VIPs and Apple mail
[07:15.340 --> 07:19.540]  Because my system of getting notifications for email is that I don't want any notifications
[07:19.540 --> 07:22.740]  but then there's the people who I do and then I just make them a VIP and
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.740]  Lo and behold a few weeks ago
[07:24.740 --> 07:28.820]  I got an error when I tried to add somebody as a VIP that says you're only allowed to have a hundred
[07:29.340 --> 07:34.820]  Which seems so I don't know if you listen to the show, but it just seems so crazily obvious that
[07:34.820 --> 07:42.060]  When somebody was engineering the VIP feature they were like, well, we might as well have a limit. I don't know what 100
[07:42.060 --> 07:46.140]  Okay, 100 if VIPs is a hundred then give an error
[07:47.140 --> 07:51.340]  It seems so stupid and I complained about the fact. Anyway, this is the follow-up aspect
[07:51.340 --> 07:54.220]  I complained about the fact that I couldn't find a way
[07:55.460 --> 07:57.460]  to I
[07:58.060 --> 08:04.760]  Could not find a way to manage my VIPs other than like randomly going through one by one and trying to find VIPs in
[08:04.760 --> 08:08.540]  Unstar of the star but it turns out there are ways to manage your VIPs
[08:08.660 --> 08:14.140]  The other problem I had is I tried to do it in context because I would I thought of VIPs is something related to context
[08:14.140 --> 08:21.360]  But it's not context. It's only in mail. So on Mac if you go to the VIPs magic mailbox and toggle the
[08:22.220 --> 08:28.780]  Disclosure triangle to the next of it. It will list all of your VIPs one by one and then you can
[08:29.480 --> 08:32.480]  control click on any one of them and remove from VIPs
[08:32.480 --> 08:33.740]  so
[08:33.740 --> 08:35.740]  there's no way to select I
[08:36.580 --> 08:43.620]  Don't think actually you can select multiple and delete at once and then on iOS you go to do your VIPs
[08:43.620 --> 08:49.500]  and there's a little eye and a circle button the info button and then you can tap that button and
[08:49.660 --> 08:54.940]  It will again show you a list of VIPs and you can manage them from there. So now I've
[08:55.660 --> 08:57.660]  kept forgetting to
[08:57.680 --> 08:59.680]  to talk about this
[08:59.680 --> 09:01.680]  I
[09:01.800 --> 09:03.120]  Just
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.880]  What I've what I do is anyone who is important to hear from I connect to them on some sort of messaging platform
[09:09.880 --> 09:14.440]  And that's the way to reach me. So if you if and that's actually true for me, too
[09:14.440 --> 09:16.760]  I mean, when's the last time you and I sent email to each other?
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.120]  I get a daily email from you, but it's a newsletter
[09:19.680 --> 09:24.480]  But you and I if you and I communicated by email, I would have I would have said hey
[09:24.480 --> 09:27.400]  Why don't you be on my show next week? And then like in December you'd be like, oh
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.760]  Shit I missed it. How about next week? And then like January would come and you'd be like
[09:33.680 --> 09:35.680]  What the hell happened? I thought he wanted me on a show
[09:39.880 --> 09:41.600]  Yeah, I
[09:41.600 --> 09:46.500]  It's funny because when back when I first, you know was when I was wasn't doing trajectory
[09:46.500 --> 09:51.480]  I think was mg siegler would just always complain about email on Twitter all the time
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.860]  I thought it was just so freaking annoying. Yeah, like okay, we get it
[09:54.860 --> 09:58.800]  You get a lot of email and now that I get a lot of hell
[09:58.800 --> 10:00.800]  I'm like I one I
[10:00.800 --> 10:06.200]  Can understand why he was complaining so much because it's really overwhelming it. I mean just what once you get at a certain volume
[10:06.200 --> 10:08.860]  It's not engineered for for sort of high
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.760]  Because you don't mean it's an asynchronous relationship and you have no control over what comes in so I can relate
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.280]  But I kind of refused to complain about it because I was so grumpy about him complaining about it. I would feel totally
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.040]  Disingenuous to to complain about it now. So so lips lips sealed. Yeah
[10:27.480 --> 10:30.100]  Except I just complained about it. All right, somebody else wrote in
[10:31.600 --> 10:37.880]  Guillermo around Rambo and I know I'm butchering his name and I'm sorry. I mispronounced everybody's name
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.320]  I I even mispronounced Ben Thompson's name probably
[10:42.920 --> 10:45.760]  But he's this is a guy who's one of the top iOS
[10:45.760 --> 10:51.000]  Sort of backwards engineers out there operating. He's sort of out there with Stephen trout and Smith
[10:52.160 --> 10:54.920]  He confirmed on Twitter the speculation
[10:54.920 --> 11:01.000]  I had that the iOS calculator app is written in Swift now along with I think a couple of the other sort of you
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.600]  like widget II type apps like
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.920]  Stocks and stuff like that. So Apple apps actually is in iOS 11 using Swift
[11:09.880 --> 11:13.720]  but it's probably true that rewriting it and Swift was what led to the
[11:13.720 --> 11:19.100]  Unfortunate type 1 plus 2 plus 3 quickly and you end up with 24 bug
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.600]  Yeah, the
[11:22.600 --> 11:28.520]  iOS 11 is I don't know it's always hard to remember like it does seem like every year it's like oh
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.280]  This is the worst update ever
[11:30.280 --> 11:32.940]  so I'm a little hesitant, you know, cuz
[11:33.640 --> 11:36.880]  Do look back and look back fondly at something. I mean I've been as fun
[11:37.040 --> 11:40.940]  But yeah, it's been it's been a I mean battery life has been the biggest thing for me
[11:40.940 --> 11:48.260]  I'm just it just obliterated battery life, but also on the phone. You're talking you're yeah on the phone
[11:49.140 --> 11:53.620]  My on my iPhone 7 and then the the cover of everything was weird
[11:53.620 --> 11:57.340]  the one that's really gotten me was I was using the timer and
[11:57.700 --> 12:03.500]  The timer would go off or would finish and then like 20 seconds later. The notification would come
[12:05.980 --> 12:10.020]  The reason the reason it's a problem is because I like to watch basketball games on the treadmill
[12:10.020 --> 12:14.900]  I mean and so I have the big iPad set up with a treadmill and I had my phone off to the side it may
[12:14.900 --> 12:16.900]  Because the phone's busy because it's also I'm using
[12:17.540 --> 12:19.940]  What's the what's the word reuse the phone as for the internet?
[12:20.780 --> 12:22.500]  Tethering. Yeah
[12:22.500 --> 12:25.980]  but what happened was I would be doing like intervals on like the treadmill and
[12:26.100 --> 12:32.340]  The problem was I using the timer and the interval would end and then I would change the speed of the treadmill and then like
[12:32.340 --> 12:33.740]  15 seconds later 20 cents later
[12:33.740 --> 12:34.260]  I
[12:34.260 --> 12:39.960]  Have already restarted the timer for the new interval and then the notification come in after like grab my phone and turn the location
[12:39.960 --> 12:46.900]  Off and it was absolutely bizarre and it's I don't know. So one that's really weird to on the on ATP a few weeks ago
[12:47.140 --> 12:51.540]  Casey was talking about that. He was getting notifications on his watch for a local notification
[12:51.540 --> 12:55.980]  Even though he wasn't connected to I heard that and I was like, wait a minute. Is that true for me, too?
[12:55.980 --> 13:00.380]  I thought maybe it was and then and then ever since that episode of ATP. It's never happened to me again
[13:00.380 --> 13:07.300]  And and I I don't know what happened, but I do remember I don't know so I like like I don't understand
[13:07.300 --> 13:13.060]  How a phone could take 25 seconds or 20 seconds or however long it is to have a local notification
[13:13.060 --> 13:18.040]  So I'm actually really curious if there is something being sent up to the cloud and and the delay is
[13:18.640 --> 13:24.420]  You know that it's being sent up to to Apple's notification service and it's coming back down even though it's local notification
[13:24.420 --> 13:29.500]  And there's and there's some sort of because I'm far away generally stuff's more leggy for me in general
[13:29.500 --> 13:33.620]  I don't think Apple Apple doesn't have a data center here in Taiwan. Yeah, I think you're right and
[13:33.620 --> 13:37.440]  So it might it might confirm
[13:38.320 --> 13:44.740]  Casey's hypothesis and would explain why it's happening but from user experiences perspective. It's it's abysmal
[13:44.740 --> 13:49.280]  It's like how can that how can that be? How can that be how you experience a timer?
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.520]  I mean timer is like the most basic functionality like a computer. All right
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.080]  I've got an anecdote to share from a little birdie who listens to the show
[13:57.080 --> 14:03.820]  I just wanted to here's an email I got I just wanted to share an anecdote that has made me laugh in recent days
[14:04.040 --> 14:07.120]  Back in I'm just gonna say a couple of handful of years ago
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.400]  This this guy was asked to interview
[14:11.060 --> 14:17.000]  For a QA job at Apple. He was gonna be a QA engineer at Apple quality assurance
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.980]  Yep, and he had ten interviews which is a lot. He had ten interviews and in two out of the ten interviews
[14:22.980 --> 14:29.660]  He was I was at I'll read from his email I was asked how I would QA the calculator app
[14:30.220 --> 14:37.460]  During the second one the interviewer gave examples of what he'd do including repetitive entry and sequential entry the examples
[14:37.460 --> 14:40.860]  he used for one plus one plus one and
[14:41.460 --> 14:43.460]  one plus two plus three
[14:45.060 --> 14:50.420]  The fact that this bug got into iOS 11 is ridiculous because it's literally what seemed like a standard
[14:50.420 --> 14:53.600]  Screening question for QA positions at Apple yikes
[14:54.540 --> 14:59.940]  Right my next to this little birdie for sharing this anecdote and permitting me
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.460]  Permitting me to share it here and I'll just say this for all those of you who are listening
[15:04.460 --> 15:05.820]  I wrote back to this
[15:05.820 --> 15:11.140]  To this listener to the show and asked that thanked him for the email and I asked him if I could if I could
[15:11.300 --> 15:15.220]  Share it here stripping the identifying details, you know
[15:15.220 --> 15:20.420]  So anybody out there who's thinking about selling me sending me certain similar stories if you don't want me to share them
[15:20.420 --> 15:22.420]  You can of course trust me not to
[15:22.660 --> 15:24.660]  But this one I thought was pretty
[15:25.180 --> 15:29.260]  Pretty bad. It's funny you the the like sharing or not sharing stuff
[15:29.340 --> 15:31.980]  Well, you it when I first started to tech retreat
[15:31.980 --> 15:34.060]  It was so jarring when we talked and so I would say oh by the way
[15:34.060 --> 15:37.420]  This is off the record and I'd be like, of course is off the record. Yeah, but I'm like, oh, yeah, I guess
[15:37.940 --> 15:41.060]  Like I guess I'm a quote-unquote media member now, but it's interesting
[15:41.060 --> 15:46.660]  I always tell them like I'm not a reporter right like so for especially for what I do. There's occasionally times
[15:46.660 --> 15:52.780]  I do know stuff and I like I don't I actually almost don't like knowing it because then like it
[15:53.100 --> 15:58.340]  Obviously will shade what I write but I almost like the purity of like I'm just I'm reacting the same thing you are
[15:58.340 --> 16:04.020]  but even then it's like I I don't want to be known as being someone that breaks news and for me getting the you know,
[16:04.020 --> 16:09.100]  You know just talk like I would my presumption is off the record just because that's not what I do
[16:09.100 --> 16:14.180]  But it is always the it's something that I have to remember to tell people I don't don't worry
[16:14.180 --> 16:17.340]  You know, it's it's all good and it's like it's like there's anything scandals going on
[16:17.340 --> 16:21.860]  It's just like to your point sometimes, you know, usually it's in response to something I write
[16:21.860 --> 16:22.580]  It's like well, you know
[16:22.580 --> 16:27.660]  There's a little more a little more color to this and what I write is based on on my own analysis, right?
[16:27.660 --> 16:32.540]  And then sometimes people will respond to that. I'm not writing what people sort of leaked to me or whatever. Well, for example
[16:34.780 --> 16:39.060]  I'm not accusing anybody who is a quote, you know puts on their business card that they're a reporter
[16:39.060 --> 16:43.340]  I've ever doing this but I know it happens sometimes where so for example this email that I got
[16:44.500 --> 16:47.540]  Didn't stay anything like this is off the record
[16:47.540 --> 16:52.740]  it just was an email from somebody who shared the email and you know, somebody who
[16:53.260 --> 16:56.600]  operated under the principle that anything was on the record by default might
[16:57.980 --> 17:00.220]  Read the person's name on the air, you know
[17:00.220 --> 17:04.780]  And I would never do that and I certainly wouldn't do it for somebody at a low level
[17:04.780 --> 17:07.940]  But I wouldn't want to do it for somebody at an executive level either. I
[17:07.940 --> 17:11.000]  I yeah, and and I have no objection like reporters doing that
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.120]  I mean, I think it like that that whole thing happened with like Steve Bannon and emailing the guy. Yeah
[17:15.780 --> 17:17.420]  at the New York or Ryan Lisa
[17:17.420 --> 17:23.500]  but like that that's like if you're a if you're a high-level political operative and you're dealing with a
[17:23.880 --> 17:30.480]  National political reporter like it it's quite clearly the rules of the game that everything's on the record unless it's plus explicitly otherwise
[17:30.700 --> 17:33.900]  And so it's funny. It's just weird. It was always weird to me to
[17:34.500 --> 17:36.500]  like fall in like I
[17:36.500 --> 17:39.020]  Kind of some people will will then put me there
[17:39.020 --> 17:39.680]  I'm like well
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.580]  Am I like I'm in the media
[17:41.580 --> 17:46.800]  But I don't really think of myself as a reporter at all. And so for me the ground rules for me are different
[17:47.260 --> 17:51.640]  That's not to say the ground rules are wrong. But I don't know this is totally inside baseball, but it's
[17:52.900 --> 18:00.820]  Reminded me of it. I don't know to me to me. It's like the the traditional media and the reporting rules are little
[18:00.820 --> 18:08.860]  on the gotcha you side where it's sort of like by it it always defaults to every conversation defaults to on the record until
[18:09.100 --> 18:12.460]  The subject flips the switch and says this is off the record
[18:14.540 --> 18:18.000]  Whereas I prefer to operate where everything defaults to a neutral position
[18:18.160 --> 18:23.880]  Where if there's any chance that what we're about to discuss might be professionally interesting to me or newsworthy in any way
[18:24.260 --> 18:26.260]  Let's stop and clarify
[18:26.260 --> 18:33.140]  What what's going on here? Let's not even you know before you even tell me anything. Let's clarify. This is on or off the record. I
[18:33.660 --> 18:38.380]  Don't like the idea that it always defaults to on the record until you say otherwise
[18:39.100 --> 18:43.380]  It just seems yeah, it just seems I'm just not comfortable with it personally
[18:44.620 --> 18:49.260]  Right, and again, I can understand it from a more sort of reporter perspective
[18:49.260 --> 18:51.260]  Like that's what that's what they do
[18:51.260 --> 18:56.440]  It but you know, the implicit trade-off is you know, are you actually getting?
[18:57.060 --> 19:02.740]  Genuine answers versus are you getting sort of PR PR boilerplate and on the flip side?
[19:02.740 --> 19:07.140]  That's sort of like you want to take the opposite view. It's like are you
[19:07.860 --> 19:09.500]  carrying water for
[19:09.500 --> 19:15.900]  Whoever it might be versus being you know objective and honest with your readers and transparent and so it's very easy
[19:15.900 --> 19:20.740]  You can critique either side depending on on what perspective you want to take. All right, let me take a break here
[19:20.740 --> 19:23.980]  It's a good time as any to thank our first sponsor and start good friends at Casper
[19:24.540 --> 19:31.260]  Casper is the sleeper and it continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience
[19:31.780 --> 19:33.780]  one night at a time
[19:34.820 --> 19:38.900]  Look my family loves their Casper mattresses. I've said it before I will say it again
[19:40.500 --> 19:43.220]  We come home from like a nice vacation at a nice hotel
[19:43.660 --> 19:49.020]  Where they have nice beds and instead of saying oh man, my bed isn't like that in a nice hotel
[19:49.020 --> 19:54.920]  My son comes home and jumps in his bed and says I so glad to be back in my bed really is true
[19:56.860 --> 20:04.500]  At Casper mattresses are perfectly designed for humans and they're engineered to soothe and cradle your natural geometry and are also designed to
[20:06.100 --> 20:11.460]  Get your body heat away from the mattress so you have a nice cool sleep and you don't get the don't get the night sweats
[20:12.300 --> 20:15.420]  Look, you spend one third of your life sleeping. I spend
[20:15.420 --> 20:20.780]  A quite a bit more than one third of my life slipping. So you should be comfortable. I know it's a canard
[20:20.780 --> 20:24.480]  It's it's a cliche that because you spend quote unquote 130 of your life sleeping
[20:24.480 --> 20:26.700]  You should spend a lot of money, you know spend good money on
[20:26.980 --> 20:32.380]  On a good mattress and good pillows and good sheets and stuff like that, but it's true. It really is true
[20:32.380 --> 20:35.400]  And I think that this idea I think the idea some people have that well you're asleep
[20:35.400 --> 20:41.240]  So who cares if you're sleeping on scratchy sheets and a rickety old mattress, you'll feel miserable in the morning
[20:41.240 --> 20:43.280]  Just because you're sleeping doesn't mean you're not enjoying it
[20:43.280 --> 20:45.040]  But
[20:45.040 --> 20:49.340]  Casper mattresses provide all the support the human body needs in the right places
[20:50.180 --> 20:53.980]  Casper's mattresses combine multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface
[20:54.520 --> 21:01.240]  their breathable design helps you sleep cool regulate your body temperature throughout the night and their design developed and
[21:01.720 --> 21:04.360]  assembled right here in the US
[21:05.160 --> 21:12.200]  They've got over 20,000 reviews and an average of 4.8 stars across Casper's own website Amazon and Google
[21:12.200 --> 21:14.680]  And Casper is becoming the Internet's favorite mattress
[21:16.800 --> 21:22.120]  Look here's the thing. You don't know what it feels like if you haven't seen one before you don't know if I'm
[21:23.200 --> 21:27.120]  Telling the truth or you know, you don't know if your personal taste in a mattress matches
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.920]  What mine do?
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.200]  They've got a no hassle return policy. This is the thing. This is true. This is absolutely true
[21:34.200 --> 21:36.800]  This isn't some kind of thing like when you try to cancel your cable
[21:36.800 --> 21:40.040]  And the guy won't let you off the phone and he's trying to keep you on board or whatever
[21:40.040 --> 21:45.400]  They have a hundred night sleep then if you're not happy after three months
[21:45.560 --> 21:47.440]  Just call them up or go to the website
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.240]  If you don't want to call go to the website say I want to return they'll schedule a pickup
[21:52.240 --> 21:54.560]  they'll come get the mattress out of your house and
[21:57.080 --> 21:59.080]  Give you all your money back
[21:59.280 --> 22:04.040]  And that's cool because I'll tell you what the mattresses would be a lot harder to get out of your house than to get in
[22:04.040 --> 22:06.280]  Because they ship it in in this vacuum sealed
[22:06.280 --> 22:11.880]  It doesn't matter what size or what type of mattress you get it comes in this little box like it like they call it a
[22:11.880 --> 22:14.440]  How do they do that sized box really is kind of amazing?
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.040]  And they have free shipping and returns in the US and
[22:20.120 --> 22:24.920]  Canada it's only in the US and Canada. Where do you go to find out more and buy your mattress go to?
[22:25.760 --> 22:28.460]  casper.com slash the talk show
[22:29.240 --> 22:31.240]  casper.com slash the talk show
[22:31.460 --> 22:34.240]  One of my favorite sponsors. I can't believe I'm selling mattresses
[22:34.240 --> 22:36.660]  So I forgot to tell this story
[22:36.660 --> 22:41.300]  I had Jim d'Arundel on last week, and we were both it was like the day after the iPhone embargo dropped
[22:41.300 --> 22:45.060]  And so we had sort of a first impressions of the iPhone 10
[22:46.300 --> 22:51.060]  Show I completely forgot to tell the story that the day before on Monday
[22:51.620 --> 22:55.400]  So last we recorded last Tuesday, and that's when the embargo dropped on Monday morning
[22:56.220 --> 23:00.500]  Around Monday around noon. I had a briefing in New York City with Apple where they were
[23:00.500 --> 23:05.580]  Gonna, give me my iPhone 10 review unit, and I take the Amtrak
[23:06.220 --> 23:10.100]  Up to New York. Do you know this you know this story right you know what I'm gonna
[23:10.100 --> 23:13.460]  Tell you I do I get up. I saw your I saw your picture
[23:13.460 --> 23:17.920]  I I get up it in New York well most places most cities
[23:17.920 --> 23:22.980]  I've been to the train station is sort of underground you have to go up like a flight of stairs or an escalator or something
[23:22.980 --> 23:25.740]  like that so I come up the escalator into Penn Station and
[23:25.740 --> 23:29.740]  And immediately right there at the top of my
[23:31.100 --> 23:36.420]  They don't call them terminals. I forget what they call them track right at the top of my the exit for my track
[23:38.500 --> 23:43.540]  Is Bill de Blasio the the mayor of New York City who was at time running for re-election
[23:44.340 --> 23:49.260]  And a handful of security seemed like security people and a handful of media people to not a big crowd
[23:49.460 --> 23:54.860]  But there he is and you can't miss him because Bill de Blasio is about I think he's around six five six six
[23:54.860 --> 23:56.580]  Maybe taller
[23:56.580 --> 24:00.380]  But there's he's surrounded by people, but you see his head sticking above them
[24:00.380 --> 24:03.560]  There's no missing it, and I thought well. That's something you don't see every day
[24:03.560 --> 24:06.120]  I've never seen the mayor of New York in Penn Station
[24:06.120 --> 24:08.180]  And then it occurred to me like well
[24:08.180 --> 24:13.980]  I wonder what he's waiting for and I turn around and literally like like five people behind me on the escalator is
[24:14.420 --> 24:16.100]  Bernie Sanders
[24:16.100 --> 24:21.980]  And he didn't seem to have any kind of it he had people with him, but it didn't seem like he had security
[24:22.820 --> 24:24.180]  and
[24:24.180 --> 24:29.860]  And I realized oh there had there's probably for de Blasio's re-election campaign. He's drumming up support
[24:29.860 --> 24:31.860]  he's got Bernie Sanders up in New York to
[24:34.080 --> 24:36.020]  You know I guess have some kind of event
[24:36.020 --> 24:39.900]  But I had I had to get I had to get downtown to where Apple has has these events
[24:41.180 --> 24:44.360]  They bought you know the Apple has bought some sort of mansion down in
[24:46.220 --> 24:48.380]  Downtown Manhattan and and
[24:48.820 --> 24:52.060]  It's really magnificent, but they have it just to hold media events
[24:52.060 --> 24:54.980]  And I guess I don't know what else they do throughout the year, but it's really quite a thing
[24:55.660 --> 24:57.660]  But it's I don't know a 20-minute subway ride
[24:57.900 --> 25:03.280]  So I quick I I go there infrequently enough that I never remember how to get there
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.780]  So I bring up Apple Maps on my phone and do the transit thing and the transit thing tells me
[25:08.780 --> 25:10.820]  I could either take the a train or the C train
[25:11.100 --> 25:14.060]  And this is where Apple Maps is maybe I don't know maybe not as good
[25:14.060 --> 25:14.940]  Maybe I shouldn't use it
[25:14.940 --> 25:19.540]  But it Apple Maps seemed to suggest to me that either train would be just as good
[25:19.540 --> 25:23.460]  And I figured out now that the a train is actually better
[25:25.460 --> 25:31.260]  It takes four stops to get to where you go whereas the C train stops a couple more times you get like six stops
[25:31.500 --> 25:32.900]  So a trains the way to go
[25:32.900 --> 25:38.220]  But I just randomly picked a train for that trip because I thought I don't what's six of one half
[25:38.220 --> 25:42.380]  It doesn't matter so anyway. I head towards the a train. I'm not quite. I'm not quite sure where I'm going
[25:42.380 --> 25:45.980]  I think I obviously took some kind of circuitous route
[25:45.980 --> 25:50.920]  Right because by the time I got to the platform for the a train
[25:51.140 --> 25:56.540]  There's de Blasio and Sanders standing there already. I had to presumably build de Blasio's people know
[25:57.060 --> 25:58.960]  No, they're waiting another subway better
[25:58.960 --> 26:05.000]  Well at least they know Penn Station Penn Station is meandering where without ever leaving or stepping above ground
[26:05.660 --> 26:10.240]  You can there's an entire train station for Amtrak for the Eastern corridor
[26:10.240 --> 26:16.260]  There's an entire train station for New Jersey Transit, which is commuter trains that go through New York and New Jersey
[26:16.720 --> 26:18.920]  But are completely unrelated to Amtrak
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.680]  And then there's a did also that at least five of the subway lines
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.020]  It may be more but at least five of the subway lines stop underground at Penn Station
[26:30.020 --> 26:35.980]  So I I obviously took the wrong way because I passed them before I left them before they greeted each other and by the time
[26:35.980 --> 26:37.980]  I got up there there they were again
[26:37.980 --> 26:43.200]  And so I figured what the hell this time. I'm not gonna try to avoid him and I squeezed into the car
[26:43.980 --> 26:47.080]  With Bernie Sanders and and build de Blasio and took a picture
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.740]  I posted to Instagram where it was just a couple feet away from Bernie and he was he was looking at me smiling
[26:51.740 --> 26:55.820]  It's pretty cool. Yeah, he's great. He's gritting like so did he do you're taking his picture
[26:55.820 --> 26:56.500]  Yeah, I think so
[26:56.500 --> 27:02.380]  It seems like it I took a bunch and that this is my the lesson to be learned from this is a take the train
[27:02.380 --> 27:03.540]  You never know what's gonna happen
[27:03.540 --> 27:09.860]  but B it's the old adage about photography where just take a bunch of photos take a bunch cuz I took I
[27:10.620 --> 27:14.860]  Probably should have taken more but I took about eight photos trying to get a picture of Bernie
[27:16.420 --> 27:19.040]  And when I went back and looked through them when it was all over
[27:19.380 --> 27:23.820]  There was only one of them that was any good but it was great and the other ones
[27:23.820 --> 27:27.860]  No, it's the other ones were like happens like the first three or four if I had stopped
[27:27.860 --> 27:31.500]  It was sort of like you would have had to take my word that that's Bernie Sanders
[27:31.500 --> 27:36.100]  Like you can see de Blasio cuz he's so tall but the white-haired man next to him
[27:36.260 --> 27:39.440]  You'd have to take my word that that was Bernie Sanders. You couldn't even see his face
[27:40.740 --> 27:46.660]  What's funny is in the show notes here. You have this link to a New York Post article about the trip. Yeah
[27:47.460 --> 27:48.980]  and
[27:48.980 --> 27:51.820]  There's like I just have to Sanders has this thing
[27:52.700 --> 27:54.660]  He's talking about the subway when you ride on the subway
[27:54.660 --> 27:58.780]  He's like he's he was complaining about the subway when you run in the subway. You should ride in comfort
[27:58.780 --> 28:01.940]  You should ride in the subway car where you can sit and where you know, where the train is coming
[28:02.020 --> 28:04.100]  That's not a radical idea existed on the world
[28:04.100 --> 28:09.760]  And I mean, I'm all for the subways being better and American infrastructure improving
[28:09.760 --> 28:15.660]  But this picture it looks very crowded in that subway car and I'd imagine is very crowded
[28:15.660 --> 28:18.540]  It is like half as crowded as like a Tokyo
[28:18.540 --> 28:25.380]  I've seen it or I mean I type a it's pretty crowd to buy me Tokyo is insane if you're gonna he's like and
[28:26.140 --> 28:30.540]  And their infrastructure is the Japan Japanese infrastructure is unbelievable
[28:30.540 --> 28:32.540]  It's incredible and all the trains are on time famously
[28:32.700 --> 28:36.220]  But believe me you are not getting a place to sit like that
[28:36.220 --> 28:39.020]  So I'm on board with some of the complaints
[28:39.060 --> 28:44.500]  But that is not a valid complaint even looking at this picture was looks very crowded and relative to the rest of the world
[28:44.500 --> 28:46.500]  Is not crowded at all. Yeah
[28:46.500 --> 28:51.580]  Anyway, it was a very very exciting trip before I even got the iPhone 10
[28:55.900 --> 28:58.820]  So it's funny we talked about doing the
[28:59.580 --> 29:04.700]  Doing the podcast last week and I told you that I was not gonna have an iPhone 10 because my order was delayed
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.460]  I over the weekend. I came across a
[29:08.420 --> 29:13.700]  Opportunity to acquire one sooner than I might have otherwise for a for a reasonable
[29:13.700 --> 29:15.500]  A
[29:15.500 --> 29:19.300]  reasonable surcharge that wasn't it was honestly it's very very small a less than hundred dollars and
[29:20.620 --> 29:26.460]  So I got one and I had no actually intention of writing about Apple or the iPhone this week
[29:26.500 --> 29:30.100]  But I have to say and you mentioned this when you when you first got it
[29:30.100 --> 29:32.020]  And I kind of not sure I completely believed you
[29:32.020 --> 29:38.180]  I've I was pretty I was pretty and continued to be pretty blown away by it and and maybe just be in part because
[29:38.500 --> 29:40.300]  I've always been a whittle
[29:40.300 --> 29:45.180]  Skeptical of it from the beginning in part because that button seems so key and then also the whole PR thing
[29:45.180 --> 29:47.700]  Which I know you've talked about but it was so bizarre
[29:47.700 --> 29:53.820]  Like are they trying to hide something like maybe it's because they my expectations had been sufficiently ratcheted down that
[29:54.380 --> 30:01.220]  It's been a it's been a it's been an experience with a new Apple product that that it's except for AirPods
[30:01.220 --> 30:03.220]  I feel like I haven't had in a long time
[30:03.220 --> 30:07.300]  yeah, it almost seems like and there have been a couple of good podcasts talking about the the
[30:07.300 --> 30:10.820]  new PR strategy of not
[30:12.380 --> 30:16.220]  Starting the PR blitz with a bunch of embargoed reviews from
[30:16.900 --> 30:20.660]  well-known reviewers of technical products and doing something else
[30:22.060 --> 30:24.720]  And I think that the strategy actually works both ways
[30:24.860 --> 30:30.060]  I think if you think about it where if they do feel like they have something to hide like let's say a face ID actually
[30:30.060 --> 30:34.280]  Was they they expected like oh my god, they're gonna kill us over the way this works
[30:34.280 --> 30:39.720]  Then they better not seed review units first and get something else to get the media started first
[30:39.880 --> 30:44.080]  But then if it is actually good if there's nothing to hide which I think is truly the case
[30:44.080 --> 30:46.080]  And again, we can get into some of these details
[30:46.080 --> 30:50.000]  There's there are things that complain about but nothing that you would make you say I don't love this phone
[30:52.960 --> 31:00.520]  They're so confident in that case that they don't have to they don't have to worry if people think that they didn't seed reviews early
[31:00.520 --> 31:05.620]  Because they have something to hide because they they know that the quality of product is gonna win out in the end
[31:05.620 --> 31:08.900]  Anyway, like either way they can do it. They can do it the same way
[31:10.040 --> 31:16.280]  Yeah, and the whole thing I think you you mentioned on during fireball that I'm not sure if you talked about on the on the
[31:16.280 --> 31:17.160]  on the podcast earlier
[31:17.160 --> 31:23.340]  But that they were they felt burned by the by the watch reviews and focusing on on that bug
[31:23.340 --> 31:28.840]  I mean the problem with that is one like I can you you mentioned there's like a perfect storm about how that bug happen
[31:28.840 --> 31:35.360]  but at the end of day they shipped a really bad bug like it is the fact that the early press around the
[31:35.840 --> 31:38.880]  LTU Apple watch was about a bug is Apple's fault
[31:38.880 --> 31:40.040]  It's not the press's fault
[31:40.040 --> 31:44.880]  like they if you don't want to have that sort of coverage don't ship that sort of bug and if you didn't cover that bug
[31:44.880 --> 31:47.940]  Because your QA was a part of it. Like why is the QA like that?
[31:47.940 --> 31:48.160]  well
[31:48.160 --> 31:53.320]  because Apple is so secretive in part because of like the there wasn't a
[31:53.320 --> 31:59.880]  No one was bringing in like the normal consumer use case and we are normal people could connect to like Starbucks Wi-Fi all the time
[31:59.880 --> 32:06.680]  And that's on Apple. That's Apple's fault that that happened and the fact that they seem appeared to have
[32:07.280 --> 32:10.960]  Decided the lesson to take away is to kind of lash out against the the tech press
[32:10.960 --> 32:18.680]  I mean in a passive-aggressive sort of way to me is it's it's it's almost more disturbing than the fact that they they had this
[32:18.680 --> 32:24.280]  Weird you like they won't change your strategy. That's fine. And I actually wrote a thing saying like yeah, I think it's great
[32:24.280 --> 32:28.680]  I love I think the vloggers are awesome. I love the idea that if you think about it
[32:29.240 --> 32:35.040]  It's it's funny because you were the kind of the one guy that spoke out about like the strategy like what's going on here
[32:35.200 --> 32:40.600]  And you're if anything you are actually much closer to the vloggers anyone else because you're a one-man sort of show
[32:40.760 --> 32:45.340]  That's built your own brand by virtue of the internet the internet makes it possible for you to do what you do
[32:45.340 --> 32:51.680]  Whereas you go back to the original iPhone the reason they got those review units is first and foremost because of the publications
[32:51.680 --> 32:57.260]  They work for and even going forward like I think Neelay Patel is a great reviewer
[32:57.260 --> 33:00.980]  I thought his iPhone video review was was excellent and definitely worth watching
[33:01.100 --> 33:05.260]  But at the end of the day if it was just Neelay Patel and he didn't work for The Verge
[33:05.260 --> 33:11.500]  Which to his credit he has built into a meaningful brand, but if he didn't have that publication brand attached to him
[33:11.500 --> 33:16.300]  It's still like sort of a publication sort of thing where these YouTube guys like they're coming up from nothing, right?
[33:16.300 --> 33:21.100]  They're literally just throwing up videos on YouTube and building an audience in the most sort of organic way possible
[33:21.100 --> 33:26.860]  And and to see those kind of folks be rewarded with this sort of attention to me
[33:26.860 --> 33:29.420]  It's very like sort of gratifying in someone in a similar situation
[33:30.220 --> 33:33.700]  And so to me it's it's great that they did this but to have this
[33:34.100 --> 33:38.660]  With the right hand is doing this cool thing and the left hand is kind of like doing this
[33:38.660 --> 33:45.500]  This sort of like vindictive sort of well screw you guys and we'll give you, you know, 12 hours with the phone is
[33:46.380 --> 33:48.500]  It's unfortunate and I think it's um
[33:48.500 --> 33:52.740]  I think a little more introspection on Apple side would have been a better would have been a better
[33:52.980 --> 33:55.740]  Would have been a better response to the the watch thing
[33:57.980 --> 34:02.080]  Part of it I was I had the wrong impression at first
[34:03.380 --> 34:06.380]  And if I had anything to take anything back
[34:06.380 --> 34:10.180]  It would be some of the YouTube some of the snide comments I made about the YouTube reviews
[34:10.180 --> 34:15.540]  I might have done differently because I I was under the impression that they'd had the phone for a couple of days
[34:15.540 --> 34:17.420]  And this is what they came up with
[34:17.420 --> 34:24.460]  but really what they did was the equivalent of a second round of the hands-on area after the event and
[34:24.700 --> 34:26.180]  and in fact
[34:26.180 --> 34:28.980]  all of those videos the ones that came out on
[34:29.900 --> 34:31.900]  Monday
[34:31.900 --> 34:37.380]  The day before like panzerinos full review dropped and the
[34:38.020 --> 34:41.820]  Goofy 10-hour period that the rest of us got to review the phone
[34:42.380 --> 34:44.380]  dropped
[34:44.420 --> 34:46.680]  They were all shot at that
[34:47.860 --> 34:51.980]  At that that that that I was gonna say place you into a place
[34:51.980 --> 34:54.780]  I went to in New York it was I think it used to be a home
[34:54.780 --> 34:59.480]  It's I don't think anybody lives there now, but it's it's hard to describe but it's sort of like a I don't know
[34:59.480 --> 35:04.520]  Some kind of just this sort of mansion that could only exist in Manhattan, you know
[35:04.520 --> 35:07.480]  Like it wouldn't you wouldn't call it a mansion in the countryside
[35:07.480 --> 35:10.760]  but in terms of square footage and the beautiful sunlight and everything
[35:10.760 --> 35:13.680]  but if you look around at those videos, you can get a sense of the I
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.400]  Think the top two floors of that building that Apple now bones or I don't know if they own the whole building. They might only own
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.120]  Top no make sense. Yeah
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.640]  I mean like if you're if you if you're buying a mansion in New York
[35:24.640 --> 35:27.000]  You're buying a condo on like the the top of it
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.100]  But if you watch those videos again, and I'll put the links in the show notes
[35:30.100 --> 35:32.560]  You can see actually which I didn't pick up on it first
[35:34.160 --> 35:37.900]  Because I was trying to concentrate at first on what these people said about the iPhone 10
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.520]  But if you look at the videos, you can see that they were all shot in the same place
[35:43.640 --> 35:47.660]  And I also do think and it's I'm not even this isn't even criticism
[35:47.880 --> 35:54.980]  It's not even criticism, but I I actually do think that the youtubers deliberately framed the videos to
[35:54.980 --> 35:56.420]  To
[35:56.420 --> 35:58.300]  Sort of disguise that fact
[35:58.300 --> 36:01.780]  I'd like to sort of make this seem like their access was a little bit more
[36:01.980 --> 36:09.340]  Exclusive than it actually was that they weren't all just in a big hands-on room by them, you know with each other, right? Right
[36:10.940 --> 36:17.260]  And so they didn't get more than like minutes with the phone which is partly why their videos seemed so shallow
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.320]  Right because well, of course they were shallow they they you know
[36:21.320 --> 36:25.900]  they had the phone for like I don't know half an hour an hour or something and
[36:26.700 --> 36:32.100]  To answer people's questions like a couple of podcasts this week said like well, even if you were gonna go with YouTube
[36:32.820 --> 36:33.980]  youtubers
[36:33.980 --> 36:35.980]  Why in the world wouldn't you have like?
[36:36.500 --> 36:42.320]  MKB HD or I just teen or some of the ones who were you know, the top tier ones and that's because
[36:43.940 --> 36:47.060]  Those I got just teen and and MKB HD
[36:47.060 --> 36:51.340]  they were at the event in September and they were at the regular hands-on area and
[36:52.820 --> 36:55.460]  I'm guessing got seated. I don't know
[36:55.460 --> 36:55.940]  Yeah
[36:55.940 --> 37:01.180]  I'm guessing that they got well a couple a couple of these a couple of these youtubers were at the event in
[37:01.580 --> 37:04.400]  Were they September also? Yeah a couple of them referenced it
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.580]  I think but I think the thing is is that is that those the youtubers you just referenced they're on the same
[37:09.700 --> 37:11.700]  They're in the same audience as the verge
[37:11.700 --> 37:15.520]  They're in the same audience as as you they're in the same audience as tech crunch
[37:15.520 --> 37:20.740]  And I think this was clearly an attempt to reach a new and different audience
[37:20.740 --> 37:25.380]  It was probably also a bit of an experiment. And so that that was a reason to maybe do
[37:25.980 --> 37:27.180]  a
[37:27.180 --> 37:29.180]  different a different set of a
[37:29.440 --> 37:34.580]  Relative audience speaking smaller set then then maybe they'll do in the future me the future
[37:34.580 --> 37:37.860]  They will really blow out the sort of YouTube thing and spread it out broadly
[37:37.860 --> 37:39.740]  And again, I think I think it's a great idea
[37:39.740 --> 37:41.280]  But I think we both you know
[37:41.280 --> 37:46.440]  We're on the same page. It would have made so much more sense to have it be additive as opposed to subtractive
[37:46.440 --> 37:50.240]  Like it's not like they're short on units. I mean, that's a that's a broader story, too
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.740]  I'm they're making they're clearly making more of these than I think, you know people people expected in general
[37:55.740 --> 37:57.820]  But that would never affect the number of units
[37:57.820 --> 38:02.400]  Anyway, like if there there's a difference between like 15 review units and 30 review units
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.380]  they're not actually producing a phone because that's that's not a I mean Apple is at such scale like that's not a
[38:08.380 --> 38:13.140]  A concern even if and we now know that since pre-orders went out
[38:13.660 --> 38:20.840]  That they had millions of millions of phones certainly far more than the quote one or two million that Ming Chi quo quoted
[38:21.780 --> 38:26.060]  You know, there's no question that there are more than one or two million iPhones at launch
[38:26.940 --> 38:29.920]  And they're doing pretty well like they're still you know
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.660]  even now as we record they still if you ordered a phone right now as we speak you still could get a
[38:34.660 --> 38:41.120]  December ship date and a lot of the people who had mid-november and December ship dates have since gotten
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.560]  Updates that their ship date has moved up. So they're you know, they're doing well
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.740]  but even in the worst-case scenario like there's no way that they they only had
[38:52.200 --> 38:54.200]  They couldn't get 30
[38:54.640 --> 38:56.880]  30 phones and had to settle for 15
[38:57.840 --> 38:59.360]  they're
[38:59.360 --> 39:06.920]  polished gemstones being like there's one guy one guy right in the on the assembly line who knows how to put these things together and
[39:06.920 --> 39:09.680]  He's spending all day making them like a handmade watch
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.480]  Yeah, I mean this scale is the scale is so hard to comprehend
[39:14.480 --> 39:14.700]  I mean
[39:14.700 --> 39:20.440]  I know you've it's funny like I guess is one thing that I almost took for granted because I know you you've written and
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.840]  noted in the last few weeks about the fact that these decisions had to be made in November and I guess I
[39:25.840 --> 39:28.760]  I of course they had to be in November
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.120]  I mean they are making tens of millions of phones and I like I you sometimes see these weird comments where I'm like
[39:34.120 --> 39:41.600]  Oh, it took Apple six months to copy Samsung on this like no like if any two features happen simultaneously on two phones
[39:41.920 --> 39:48.840]  Within like a year and that's pushing it then they were decisions made independently separately of each other
[39:49.040 --> 39:52.560]  and the other thing though to note is it clearly there is
[39:52.560 --> 39:59.400]  The reporting wasn't that said the party wasn't wrong if the iPhone 10 is clearly supply constraint
[39:59.400 --> 40:06.560]  You can tell by looking at Apple's results because if you if you go through their results and you measure and you presume
[40:06.640 --> 40:14.120]  If you look back what what's the expectations for iPad? What's the expectations for the Mac? What's the expectations for their wearables division?
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.920]  What's the expectations for services and you take that out and you subtract that to me?
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.240]  I'm predicting those categories will be about twenty five point six billion in revenue next quarter
[40:23.240 --> 40:27.120]  so if you take twenty five point six billion away from the
[40:27.720 --> 40:30.400]  what they're predicting in total revenue that actually
[40:30.800 --> 40:38.280]  that the amount that's left for the phones is like about sixty billion and that either means that ASP is going down or
[40:38.640 --> 40:42.040]  it means that their units are going to be down and
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.840]  And that suggests that there's going to be excess demand
[40:46.840 --> 40:48.840]  that's not being met by supply because
[40:49.400 --> 40:55.280]  Unless you believe that units is gonna fall significantly or that ASP is gonna fall which given the fact they're selling much more expensive phones
[40:55.280 --> 40:57.880]  if that seems highly unlikely to say right like like
[40:59.920 --> 41:03.940]  Unit for unit comparing this year's iPhone 8 and 8 plus
[41:04.280 --> 41:11.200]  Models to last year's iPhone 7 models the prices have come down a little bit, you know, so if you wanted a 256
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.840]  I've
[41:13.840 --> 41:20.840]  256 gig iPhone 7 plus last year it was actually a little bit more expensive than the iPhone 8 plus with the maximum
[41:21.120 --> 41:26.920]  Storage this year, but not by much but the like 30 bucks. Yeah, but like the idea that the I've the
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.400]  1149 and 999
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.280]  iPhone 10 aren't going to raise the ASP. It seems a little nutty
[41:35.280 --> 41:41.160]  I think it well also the 64 gigabyte iPhone 8 is more expensive. Yes $50 because last year's was 32, right?
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.760]  Right, exactly. No, no, no, not just that. No, I think it was 64, but it started at 649 this year
[41:46.760 --> 41:52.360]  It starts at 699. Oh, so and the other thing driving this this is kind of an interesting point
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.600]  apples
[41:54.600 --> 41:56.200]  memory prices have
[41:56.200 --> 41:58.320]  exploded in the last in the last year or so
[41:58.320 --> 42:05.440]  I mean actually the company that's really killing right now is Samsung and a few years ago and and I wrote about this at the
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.320]  time as Samsung clearly pivoted not pivoted, but as Samsung's always been the best at
[42:11.840 --> 42:13.840]  components and and they've been the best by just
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.640]  Sheer force of will and massive investment where they that's how the wheatfrog Sony and build it in memory and stuff like that
[42:19.640 --> 42:23.480]  and and then they and the other Japanese companies and then they they just they
[42:23.480 --> 42:28.720]  Used all the revenue that was throwing off these operations to invest more and more and more to always kind of be on the cutting
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.480]  edge and when a few years ago when you know, the their smartphones were really starting to
[42:34.480 --> 42:40.960]  Hit the rough sort of rough patch that they did they made a kind of clear decision, too
[42:40.960 --> 42:42.720]  We're gonna double down on components again
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.800]  and they made this they built this massive factory a couple of massive factories one the OLED screens and to the
[42:48.920 --> 42:52.480]  On memory and it is paying off in a massive way right now
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.220]  I mean they they are so profitable right now
[42:54.220 --> 42:58.360]  And do you see they're charging Apple like 150 bucks per OLED screen or something like that?
[42:58.360 --> 43:03.580]  I did not see and so but I did see I saw I saw a couple of pieces though that the consensus seems almost
[43:03.580 --> 43:11.420]  Unanimous that Samsung makes more profit on an iPhone or at least on an iPhone 10 than they make on their own high-end phones
[43:12.660 --> 43:18.540]  Yeah, I mean, I I don't I'm not sure about that, but I it wouldn't surprise me. But yeah, they're charging
[43:20.540 --> 43:24.740]  Yeah, there's a I'll send you the links and put in the show notes well you could put it in the show notes yourself
[43:24.740 --> 43:33.700]  I could you could so so Apple is charging Apple a hundred ten dollars per unit for the OLED display
[43:33.700 --> 43:34.820]  I'm sung is that Apple?
[43:34.820 --> 43:37.700]  Yeah, and this is the IHS estimates which Tim Cook says all those aren't right
[43:37.700 --> 43:43.840]  But I mean, that's the best thing we have. So there there's it says there Apple's paying a hundred ten units for a display
[43:43.980 --> 43:46.700]  Whereas for the eight plus they they're paying fifty dollars a unit
[43:46.700 --> 43:54.240]  Yeah, and would for the regular LCD display and it also has internal charges like Samsung charges themselves
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.380]  Internally eighty five dollars per screen. So they're basically
[43:58.440 --> 44:05.520]  They're there make Apple's paying like a $25 premium just because Samsung's the only company that can produce screens to the quality
[44:06.120 --> 44:10.040]  Through the quality Apple wants and so they really have them over a barrel here
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.160]  So what's interesting is if these numbers are correct, correct these IHS numbers
[44:14.800 --> 44:20.120]  Apple even though the iPhone 10 is searching $1,000 Apple's margin
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.280]  II on a percentage basis is actually less on the iPhone 10 that is in the iPhone 8 so
[44:26.000 --> 44:33.100]  It's not. Yes. It's more expensive than get more revenue, but it's not a pure cash grab like they to maintain their margins
[44:33.100 --> 44:37.340]  They literally had to charge $1,000 for the phone. Yeah Apple emphasized
[44:39.080 --> 44:41.960]  In my briefing and I saw it in
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.240]  Parroted and a bunch of the reviews I read so it was obviously something that they mentioned in every
[44:48.240 --> 44:52.700]  single briefing for everybody who got a review unit of the iPhone that
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.020]  The OLED display in the iPhone 10 is not a Samsung design
[44:57.020 --> 45:03.300]  It is entirely from beginning to end an Apple design that Samsung said just manufacturers
[45:03.300 --> 45:08.700]  It is the equivalent in displays to the a11 chip in
[45:09.660 --> 45:16.220]  CPUs where nobody else has a display like this now whether it's as much far ahead as of
[45:16.220 --> 45:17.780]  of competing
[45:17.780 --> 45:22.840]  Products as the a11 is versus like the high-end Snapdragon chips. I don't think that's true
[45:22.840 --> 45:27.240]  It seems to me like like there's a case to be made and that that display mate guy
[45:28.340 --> 45:30.340]  You know familiar with that guy
[45:31.040 --> 45:33.040]  No, I don't think so
[45:34.140 --> 45:36.140]  I'll put a link in the show notes
[45:37.140 --> 45:39.400]  It's this guy. Dr. Raymond somebody
[45:39.400 --> 45:45.360]  a display mate you go to display mate calm just
[45:47.360 --> 45:51.860]  Go to display mate calm and see why I'm a little exasperated here
[45:54.280 --> 45:57.920]  I find his website to be a bit of a jumble to read
[45:59.480 --> 46:03.080]  Which is ironic, but he does reviews of
[46:03.920 --> 46:05.920]  you know displays and
[46:05.920 --> 46:10.760]  It seems like he really is on the up-and-up in so far as that
[46:11.320 --> 46:14.200]  Unlike DXO the company that rates cameras
[46:15.040 --> 46:17.040]  and also coincidentally
[46:17.740 --> 46:22.280]  offers their services for consulting to the makers of smartphone cameras and
[46:24.360 --> 46:30.660]  May or may not give better reviews and higher priority reviews to those who hire them
[46:30.660 --> 46:36.180]  This guy doesn't seem to do anything like that. There doesn't seem to be any kind of shakedown to get a rating from him
[46:36.180 --> 46:38.940]  He just I don't know what else he does. He might be a consultant in some way
[46:38.940 --> 46:43.960]  But you know, anyway, he his review of the iPhone X display or iPhone 10 display
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.060]  I should say was glowing and he called it the best display ever made
[46:47.340 --> 46:53.780]  and has all sorts of technical reasons for showing and proving, you know, not just like it looks better, but like
[46:54.860 --> 46:58.240]  putting them under electron microscope and measuring the actual
[46:58.240 --> 47:00.880]  and knit units coming out of the display
[47:01.760 --> 47:05.780]  Ways that are measurable and objective that it's a better display, right?
[47:05.780 --> 47:06.720]  That's totally fine
[47:06.720 --> 47:14.740]  And I believe Apple that it is their design but it's funny that they mentioned manufacturing competency is is a very real thing
[47:14.740 --> 47:21.000]  Oh, it's a very real thing in a in a in this it's interesting because people get so focused on Apple strategy where Apple sells
[47:21.440 --> 47:25.680]  Differentiated products that people will pay a premium for but that that's like not the only viable
[47:25.680 --> 47:30.900]  Strategy, right? I mean one is just is to have a superior cost structure
[47:30.900 --> 47:37.780]  Which and which amp which Samsung does in their manufacturing components where they're at such scale and they're so far ahead in their processes
[47:37.820 --> 47:41.420]  Relative to other companies that they can just produce this stuff cheaper than everyone else
[47:41.420 --> 47:46.260]  Which means if they sell stuff at the same price as everyone else their their margins are actually much greater
[47:46.260 --> 47:51.660]  It's like it's like the Apple strategy flipped over on its head and in the case of OLED displays
[47:51.660 --> 47:58.640]  What seems to be the case is not only to Samsung have their usual sort of scale and cost structure advantages the actual
[47:58.860 --> 48:04.740]  Pure capability of making the screen to Apple specification. They're the only ones that can do it. And so
[48:05.700 --> 48:09.820]  They're they are profiting very nicely from that and and you know, it is so
[48:12.260 --> 48:14.260]  It's probably not purely coincidental
[48:14.260 --> 48:20.240]  It's just instructive I suppose because I think the reasons that Google decided to do what they did weren't coincident
[48:20.240 --> 48:25.660]  I think it was because they wanted they knew that I that Apple was moving to OLED with their flagship phone and
[48:25.900 --> 48:27.900]  Wanted to stay there
[48:28.220 --> 48:35.500]  So they moved the new that they're the new pixel twos both have OLED displays and the smaller one has a Sam a Samsung
[48:35.500 --> 48:41.380]  OLED display and the larger one has an LG display and the LG display is literally a disaster like
[48:42.140 --> 48:43.860]  it
[48:43.860 --> 48:47.380]  it has a horrible color shifting and it suffers from
[48:47.380 --> 48:51.220]  Image retention after about a week of use or at least on some units
[48:51.780 --> 48:56.260]  So there's a lot of things there and it just is funny. What I'm saying though is it just shows that
[48:57.380 --> 49:01.020]  LG's OLED capable manufacturing capabilities are not
[49:01.660 --> 49:08.580]  anywhere close to Samsung's that you really it's the proof that to me is the proof that Samsung is the only company of
[49:09.100 --> 49:11.100]  capable of producing
[49:11.180 --> 49:14.700]  Manufacturing whatever you want to say that displays up to Apple's standards
[49:14.700 --> 49:20.300]  yeah, and this is why Apple is is spending, you know spends tons and tons of money to
[49:20.820 --> 49:26.260]  Help basically help other companies build off this capability like so Apple played a big role in
[49:26.820 --> 49:31.820]  Acquiring Toshiba's memory unit for example, right because it'd be they want to build that up
[49:31.820 --> 49:38.020]  So there's more supply in the market so they can pay more because their scale is so massive that they'll do these
[49:38.580 --> 49:41.780]  multi-billion dollar investments where they're practically giving money to
[49:41.780 --> 49:46.820]  Suppliers to build up their capabilities so that Apple can then in return buy more stuff from them
[49:46.820 --> 49:50.660]  But but at a lower sort of unit unit cost if you think about it if Apple sells
[49:51.540 --> 49:52.420]  like
[49:52.420 --> 50:00.500]  100 100 million iPhone iPhone 10s and that premium is is really $60 like that article says I mean
[50:00.500 --> 50:05.780]  That's like that's just a huge. That's what 100 100 million times 60. It's 60 six
[50:05.780 --> 50:12.340]  Six billion dollars like it pays off right to to bring on these suppliers online and it's a really great example of why
[50:12.340 --> 50:18.620]  Yeah, do you remember there was a story probably about ten years ago where Apple had locked in a long-term price on?
[50:19.340 --> 50:20.700]  memory
[50:20.700 --> 50:28.900]  memory chips and lo and behold the prices shot up and because Apple had signed this long-term contract, you know, I
[50:29.940 --> 50:32.180]  Guess more or less in anticipation. That's fine
[50:32.180 --> 50:38.460]  I guess more or less in anticipation that for some reason or somewhere within that Apple supply chain and
[50:39.940 --> 50:42.100]  You know the Tim Cook's, you know
[50:44.260 --> 50:45.940]  Operating division they figured out
[50:45.940 --> 50:51.020]  you know that either it was going to happen or it was likely enough to happen that it would be worth making the bet to
[50:51.020 --> 50:53.020]  lock the prices and now and
[50:53.780 --> 50:55.780]  It was I think it was mostly for iPods
[50:55.780 --> 51:00.980]  I think the chip that's why that's why I thought that's probably why they knew to make the decision right Apple was gonna be the
[51:00.980 --> 51:07.620]  Primary driver of memory demand. I think they understood how much iPod is gonna grow is gonna engender competitors
[51:07.740 --> 51:10.300]  Yeah, there's what that's one of the all-time great business deals
[51:10.300 --> 51:16.140]  Like it's I mean, it's I think Apple sort of people follow the company closely remember it but broadly speaking
[51:16.140 --> 51:22.660]  I mean, it's it's it is a deal that was worth billions of dollars in profit. Even it wasn't
[51:23.180 --> 51:26.100]  Earned by again. It wasn't earned by driving up revenue
[51:26.100 --> 51:28.260]  It was earned on the opposite side by by limiting cost
[51:28.260 --> 51:31.340]  But that doesn't make it at the end of the line from a bottom line perspective
[51:31.340 --> 51:36.820]  It was just as impactful however hard other companies found it to make competing media players
[51:37.620 --> 51:41.260]  With the iPod once that they were priced out of the memory market
[51:41.260 --> 51:48.020]  it was almost like they couldn't like it wasn't even whatever product marketing and branding and design and
[51:48.900 --> 51:50.900]  the lack of an iTunes
[51:50.900 --> 51:57.540]  Interface to get music onto the device, you know that
[51:58.180 --> 52:01.000]  They just couldn't even price the chips competitively, right?
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.580]  Well, they didn't even have a cost advantage
[52:02.580 --> 52:07.040]  Like you would hope that at least if you're gonna build a a quote unquote inferior product
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.860]  You could at least make it cheaper, but but they could and this is it
[52:09.860 --> 52:13.140]  This is a long-standing advantage of Apple in general
[52:13.140 --> 52:15.140]  I mean you've talked about how
[52:15.140 --> 52:21.140]  The scale of the iPhone makes its challenging to bring new technologies to market because you have to be able to produce it in the you
[52:21.140 --> 52:27.400]  Know tens of millions about hundreds of millions within a year and if that that's a really really hard on the flip side though
[52:27.900 --> 52:29.900]  Apple can get to a
[52:31.020 --> 52:37.980]  position where they have so much leverage over over component prices and and and because all the investments that goes into these lines to
[52:37.980 --> 52:44.860]  Say build out the capability to make a particular sort of component or to build the capability to to like with the unibody thing
[52:44.860 --> 52:49.740]  Like there was this report about they had a prototype machine that can make it and but they couldn't figure out how to manufacture it
[52:49.740 --> 52:51.900]  So Apple basically bought every prototype machine in the world
[52:51.900 --> 52:55.820]  It's put it on the assembly line or that there may be a bit apocryphal
[52:55.820 --> 52:58.500]  but the idea is why could they do that because
[52:58.740 --> 53:06.060]  They they're selling so many units that they can spread out that capital investment over over that many more units and that gives them
[53:06.060 --> 53:08.060]  a genuine price and
[53:08.820 --> 53:12.220]  Advantage a cost advantage relative to their competition, even though they're also
[53:12.220 --> 53:18.620]  Selling the most expensive phone. So it I mean scale is just so impactful on on both sides of the equation
[53:18.620 --> 53:23.260]  I remember some sort of story about Southwest Airlines having an advantage on
[53:23.860 --> 53:28.820]  Like about a decade or so ago or longer where they had somehow made some kind of fuel hedging
[53:30.300 --> 53:35.700]  Bet where they locked in long-term fuel prices before fuel went up for the rest of the airlines and
[53:35.700 --> 53:43.580]  And Southwest got it then got there by got away with charging insanely lower airfares for a couple of years versus anybody even other
[53:43.780 --> 53:45.820]  discount quote-unquote discount carriers
[53:46.500 --> 53:49.260]  Yeah, but I think I believe I I believe that is right
[53:49.260 --> 53:50.820]  But I think the same thing happened
[53:50.820 --> 53:55.780]  But opposite a few years ago when fuel prices dropped and I think it was Southwest
[53:55.780 --> 53:58.500]  But it was one you know, I was locked into higher price. It might have been mine
[53:59.540 --> 54:01.900]  and so what goes around comes around it's
[54:01.900 --> 54:04.340]  It's definitely difficult
[54:04.340 --> 54:06.860]  I had a thought I was gonna say a couple of minutes ago
[54:07.140 --> 54:11.100]  When we were talking about the review embargoes and I had been thinking for a while
[54:11.100 --> 54:17.340]  If they wanted to come out like let's have to have the real reviews the in-depth reviews come out Tuesday morning
[54:17.620 --> 54:25.480]  but they wanted Monday to start with these just to build up enthusiasm and have and and reach a new audience have these
[54:25.940 --> 54:27.940]  You know YouTube hands-on
[54:28.580 --> 54:30.580]  You know quick takes
[54:30.580 --> 54:35.420]  Why not? Why why why did they have to give the reviewers the phones the day before?
[54:35.420 --> 54:38.940]  Why couldn't they give us the phones a week before with the Tuesday embargo?
[54:38.940 --> 54:45.940]  Give us a week to write in-depth reviews and have these other reviews shipped first. I and I exactly we should be totally reasonable
[54:45.940 --> 54:48.860]  All right. All right. I've had that thought in my head ever since this happened
[54:49.140 --> 54:54.900]  I mean, it's I've been you know for ten like ten days now that's been my thought and just
[54:54.900 --> 55:02.260]  That's the problem that they half-assed the vindictiveness right? Well, if you're gonna actually be vindictive don't give you or don't give people review phone
[55:02.260 --> 55:09.300]  All right to give them at 12 hours before is like you're you're giving them an opportunity to write a view before the embargo
[55:09.300 --> 55:10.980]  It's just gonna be a crappy review
[55:10.980 --> 55:15.620]  But if you actually want to punish people don't give them a review phone if you're gonna give them review phone then give them time
[55:15.620 --> 55:16.640]  Time to use it. All right
[55:16.640 --> 55:21.860]  Well, here's the thought though that just occurred to me about why they might not have done that now vindictive vindictiveness
[55:21.860 --> 55:29.300]  might be the entire explanation, but here's the thought I believe I can't I can't name names, but I believe that there are
[55:30.300 --> 55:33.660]  a few publications that have a policy that
[55:34.380 --> 55:40.100]  If if they agree to an embargo and any competing publication breaks the embargo
[55:40.460 --> 55:43.660]  they will break the embargo immediately as well and
[55:44.660 --> 55:50.280]  Oh, so they wanted they don't want to get handed out until after the YouTube reviews dropped right out of I wonder
[55:50.280 --> 55:55.740]  I just wonder if Apple was concerned that some of the I wouldn't have you know
[55:55.740 --> 56:02.420]  but I do wonder if other publications that let's say if they had had the phone for six days and they were
[56:03.020 --> 56:05.920]  Gearing up to publish on Tuesday morning the seventh day
[56:05.980 --> 56:11.240]  But these other reviews dropped Monday and they were all like what the hell that they would immediately
[56:11.700 --> 56:15.100]  Finish up whatever they were working on and hit publish to get him out the door
[56:15.100 --> 56:19.980]  Which wasn't yeah, but wanted strategically. I would not be surprised if that had entered their mind. No
[56:22.340 --> 56:26.900]  Regardless it'll be interesting if they do next time I suspect it will be different. I do wonder I wonder
[56:29.220 --> 56:35.420]  All right, let me take another break and thank our next sponsor I don't know if you've ever heard of this company been
[56:36.700 --> 56:38.420]  It's a company called
[56:38.420 --> 56:40.060]  Squarespace
[56:40.060 --> 56:45.780]  Squarespace is a sponsor that sponsor of the New York Knicks. I
[56:46.980 --> 56:48.980]  Don't know if that's a good or bad
[56:52.020 --> 56:55.340]  Yeah, it was funny when it when it happened because if the NBA has
[56:55.580 --> 56:58.800]  Advertise your patches on their jersey this year, which for the record. I'm totally fine with
[56:59.820 --> 57:02.220]  And the Bucks have Harley Davidson, which is kind of cool
[57:02.260 --> 57:04.420]  But when it came out of like, you know
[57:04.420 --> 57:09.900]  You know trying for podcasters everywhere like this big podcast advertisers now sponsoring gonna be a team and then immediately occurred to me
[57:09.900 --> 57:11.900]  But it's the New York Knicks
[57:13.260 --> 57:15.260]  I mean the Knicks look good this year
[57:15.300 --> 57:20.860]  They're exciting porzingis is amazing. So maybe it's because of Squarespace. Maybe Squarespace is Squarespace makes stars
[57:21.380 --> 57:23.900]  That should be their slogan and you know
[57:24.120 --> 57:29.060]  Madison Square Garden is for as long as the Knicks have been bad or are is are still arguably the palace of
[57:29.260 --> 57:34.900]  professional basketball and it's certainly the one that has the most history left in it now that I know like Boston Gardens closed and
[57:34.900 --> 57:36.900]  the old LA Forum is is
[57:36.900 --> 57:41.020]  Is Chicago Stadium? Yeah, right. Anyway Squarespace is you're all-in-one
[57:42.460 --> 57:44.060]  Website
[57:44.060 --> 57:46.060]  hosting building
[57:46.340 --> 57:49.140]  Selling anything you need to do with a website
[57:49.700 --> 57:52.700]  You could do a Squarespace literally you want to build a store?
[57:52.700 --> 57:56.820]  You have something to sell you want to sell online you could build your store with Squarespace anything
[57:56.820 --> 57:59.280]  Oh, well, that would have pain in the ass. That would be then I have to handle the you know
[57:59.280 --> 58:05.220]  The SSL cert or hook up a credit card processor or something. Nope. You can do all of that through Squarespace
[58:05.220 --> 58:07.220]  They handle all the hard stuff
[58:08.260 --> 58:10.260]  All the easy stuff too, frankly
[58:11.260 --> 58:16.580]  You want to host a blog you want to host a podcast you could do that with Squarespace you would a designer
[58:16.580 --> 58:19.380]  You want to build an online portfolio showing your work?
[58:19.380 --> 58:22.480]  You could do it with Squarespace anything you want to do with a website
[58:22.700 --> 58:27.700]  You can do a Squarespace and you do not need to be a coding expert
[58:27.700 --> 58:33.060]  If you don't know the difference between CSS and HTML doesn't matter. You won't need to know it
[58:33.060 --> 58:39.380]  You could do it with Squarespace if you do if you do know CSS if you do know how to how JavaScript works
[58:39.380 --> 58:44.820]  You can you have the ability as a technical user to get in there and modify stuff like that
[58:44.820 --> 58:47.420]  So it doesn't it doesn't keep you from going under the hood
[58:47.560 --> 58:50.120]  But you never need to go under the hood if you don't want to
[58:50.280 --> 58:54.640]  It's that type of system and they handle everything from domain name registration
[58:55.620 --> 58:58.880]  to choosing templates to modifying templates to
[58:58.880 --> 59:04.080]  The actual publishing and hosting of the site with a super high high performance website
[59:04.300 --> 59:06.900]  Squarespace sites are super fast super available
[59:07.780 --> 59:10.460]  You never have to worry about the site going down or anything like that
[59:12.340 --> 59:19.460]  It really the sites look so professional everything is so intuitive and easy to use you would be surprised if you can't get it
[59:19.460 --> 59:21.460]  I would be surprised if you can't get a new website
[59:21.700 --> 59:24.460]  Pretty much ready to go within an hour a couple of hours
[59:24.460 --> 59:29.940]  Or at least convince yourself within an hour or two that this is the way to go to build your next website
[59:29.940 --> 59:34.220]  So when you do decide to sign up, here's what you do. Make sure to use the offer code talk show

[59:49.700 --> 59:51.700]  So there you go. My thanks to Squarespace
[59:51.700 --> 59:54.340]  go to squarespace.com and
[59:57.140 --> 59:59.140]  Get started today I
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.140]  Had it so there is what
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.700]  There's something that came up
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:12.740]  Earlier that that I think is really interesting and I've kind of hinted at it a couple times this week, but I'm I
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.940]  Think you agree and I'm interested in your take on it
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:22.660]  What's been really striking is kind of the context of bugs, right? We have we talked about the calculator bug and stuff like that
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:29.180]  And the various other flaws and apples in Apple software and products that that are there and you can question
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.680]  Are there more than before they are they less than before?
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.820]  I think there's probably always an aspect of the past always seems better than it actually was but
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.860]  There's also the aspect of Apple's products are so much more complicated now particularly now that they have
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:48.700]  cloud components and stuff that more bugs and user interface problems are inherent and there's the issue of just a company getting bigger and
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:53.940]  Larger and the old guard kind of retiring and going away that maybe the standards aren't aren't what they used to be
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.100]  But what's been so?
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:04.780]  regulatory for me about the iPhone 10 is the fact that the iPhone 10 is far less perfect than
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.040]  the iPhone 7 was
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.440]  All right, let's I know where you're going. Why don't we just read I have it quoted in the notes
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.380]  Do you want to read it or should I should I read it?
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.660]  It's an excerpt from your daily update this week
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:21.040]  Or do you want it? Do you want to start the preface before go now? You can read it. You can read it
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040]  It's fine. All right, this is a
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.300]  This is from one of Ben's daily updates this week to subscribers of strip strip tech hurry
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.240]  Strategery, it's true. It's actually you had it
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:38.400]  It after like 10 episodes there it goes is is wonderful subscription newsletter. All right, and I it
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.920]  Alright, here's the quote. I'm gonna read it
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.600]  There is though a place beyond perfection and I alluded to that in yesterday's article
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:53.920]  Delight, I like cars and whiskey as an analogy often the perfect car or whiskey is well
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.740]  Perfect. What makes the sow that makes the soul sore though are
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:07.100]  imperfections the car that stirs emotion even though it breaks down constantly or rides too rough the whiskey that is ever so slightly off or
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.060]  variable by bottle but absolutely intrigues
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.820]  To that end what has been revelatory
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:19.960]  About the iPhone 10 is the fact that its imperfections are not the cause for frustration, but a rather
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.180]  Casually tossed aside because the core experience is just so well fun
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:33.260]  It is dare. I say far more akin to the original iPhone than it is to the iterated perfection of the iPhone 7
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.460]  There are rough edges sure, but the rough edges exist not because of sloppiness
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:43.900]  but because of ambition and that makes them far more benign and experienced than they perhaps deserve to be I
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.060]  Wish that I had written that I really I mean that's the highest compliment I can pay to it because I
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.380]  agree completely including the analogies
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:03:02.340]  Well, we've actually discussed I think those particularly in terms of whiskey anyway that that exact idea because we the
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.380]  the context is I think was Japanese whiskeys right where
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:14.100]  They're they're so perfect and they even down to the bottle like they have a screw top like I'm sorry, but but
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.660]  Whiskey, we should have a screw top
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:21.280]  It shouldn't have a cork that that disintegrates and then falls into the whiskey and ends up paying the rear end
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:27.280]  And it's only there for tradition doesn't actually add benefit unlike say like, you know red wine or something like that questionable seal
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:33.300]  I think compared to a screw top a tightly tightly attached screw top I to me try trust to be more
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:40.700]  Closer to 100% airtight than a cork to top because whiskey ages whiskey ages and cast doesn't age in bottles
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:46.180]  It's not it's not wine and to have a cap to have a cork is yeah, it's it's it's not as good
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:52.020]  Yeah, I believe it's true of Japanese products in general. I think it's certainly true
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.260]  And and again the cars are the other one. I think Japanese cars are I
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:05.860]  Don't even know if it's an opinion. I think I think it's almost it's almost quantifiable by consumer product surveys far more reliable than
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.940]  Like say German cars, you know that if you buy
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:15.260]  it or American cars or any other cars, you know that well for sure American cars
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:21.000]  You know if you buy a Lexus or an Acura or an infinity
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.860]  You're gonna get a more reliable car than a Mercedes or an Audi
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:33.060]  Or even a BMW maybe even especially BMW. Yeah, I think I think Mercedes are more reliable
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.800]  Yeah, Mercedes might be might be the the somewhat of an exception to that
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.000]  But you're also going to get a car
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.680]  That's probably less fun in certain ways and maybe sort of inspires less
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.920]  Love or passion if you will it's it's so hard to talk about because it's not really quantifiable
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.400]  All right
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:00.960]  Like how do you how do you articulate the sort of thrill that comes like the first time you sort of mash down?
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.960]  I'm like a BMW accelerator
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.360]  relative to
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.760]  Relative to a Lexus even though they may even accelerate the same speed like there's just there's like it was like I you almost feel
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.920]  Stupid saying it even though kind of broadly we all kind of know it's there's something there
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.700]  But because it's so indefinable and hard to articulate you feel dumb saying it but it but it's a thing
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.700]  I mean if you act if you bought cars based on
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:30.720]  Feeds and speeds as it were based on on specs and that includes reliability includes all the other things
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.280]  Well, the Japanese the Japanese are already fantastic in a fantastic business is building cars
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.720]  But they'd be even more dominant than they are and again, this isn't a this isn't a stereotypical thing
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.760]  You just look at the numbers look at look at the consumer reports. Look at the sales numbers and and
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.660]  But they're they don't have it all they don't have the entire market and why not and I would compare it directly
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.600]  And I'm not trying to say it's on the same level
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.640]  But I think it's the same part of the brain and the same part of human psychology to
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:06.600]  Trying to explain how it is that you develop a crush on a significant other what it is, you know that it
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:15.240]  How do you explain it how do you explain how it is when you fall head over heels in love with somebody and you find
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.680]  yourself
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.840]  Wildly attracted to them and looking over all looking over all the flaws, right? Right, you know that
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.440]  You know ninety nine point nine nine percent of us
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.040]  aren't
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:35.480]  going out with or married to a supermodel, you know, it's you know,
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:43.400]  That's just the way it is. But I you know, we fall in love nonetheless head over heels wildly passionately can't obsessively in love
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.400]  You can't explain it really and that's the way it is with some of these products
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:55.080]  and I you know and again that analogy to the whiskey is interesting too because the Japanese whiskey you and I both agree is is
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:02.440]  Arguably, perfect or it yeah, it's Yamazaki, right? Well, there's like there there's it's it's flawless
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.000]  it's flawless and it's always exactly the same and
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.280]  You can't complain about any aspect to it
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.360]  But there's something about like a wildly
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.880]  uneven
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:21.960]  Whiskey like a lagavulin, you know lagavulin is like a whiskey like the guy at the gym who only works on his arms and doesn't
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:28.920]  Work on his legs and he's got toothpick legs and these crazy strong arms. It's like that's what lagavulin is like with the the pettiness
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.320]  It's like this is out of control like sometimes you wonder like like I remember the first time I had lagavulin
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.680]  I was with guy English. It was of course who who introduced me to it and I honest to god my first sip
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.120]  I thought he was maybe I thought maybe this is like a gag. You know what I mean? Like
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.680]  Like he's been telling me John you gotta go out gonna you're gonna you know
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.320]  You're gonna drink this you're gonna love it and I took the first sip and I really thought that he was pulling my leg
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.960]  I I really did and then I fell in love with it
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.000]  Yeah, I I just when I tried earlier this year a Buna Buna haban
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.160]  I'm not I'm sure I'm saying it wrong, but same idea like every time I drink it. I feel like absolute shit the next morning
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:15.640]  About it like and usually that comes from imperfections like that's what that's the stuff that makes you feel feel unfortunate
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.160]  But it it's so like there's it's so
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:27.720]  It's intriguing like there it's so it's so enjoyable like that feeling in your mouth in a way that like the you know
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:31.400]  Yamazaki, which is my favorite whiskey just just isn't and
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.040]  No, and again and what so what's so intriguing about this though?
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.000]  and I actually like the the point you made about relationships and looking over flaws is
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.960]  The the fundamental problem with software in particular is there is always going to be flaws
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.840]  It's it's this entire
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.520]  Rickety sort of idea built on top of rickety foundations this ricketyness all the way down
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.480]  Where people are literally putting together these concepts in and there's going to be bugs
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.360]  There's going to be holes and there's gonna be weird interactions. It's just gonna happen all the time and I mentioned earlier the more
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.680]  Complex this software gets particularly starts interacting with the cloud and you're introducing tons of new variables. There's going to be problems
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:18.840]  There's going to be imperfections and the natural response to deal with imperfections is to try to get rid of them all
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.040]  The problem is that it's an impossible job. It's it's the pushing the rock up the hill
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.840]  you're never going to get rid of all bugs and
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.600]  What the what the tenants really remind me of in a way that it's been easy to be down on the ground
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.240]  But the tenants really remind me of in a way that it's been easy to be down on apple for bugs
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.560]  And I thought apple supposed to be perfect and the integration hardware software all that sort of stuff. What's been so
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  striking to me about the 10 is
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.800]  How that feeling of delight makes the bugs are still there and the and the i-10 does just have bugs
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.920]  There's like literally legitimate sort of use issues around some of the things that that are that are challenging
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.040]  But it just doesn't matter like it's fine. Like I I
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.360]  I I it's i'm nearly, you know
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.960]  It's a week in here and I still feel delighted using this phone and it makes all those bugs like oh, that's fine
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.320]  That's a bug
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.880]  And it and that's that's how you deal with bugs you deal with bugs by putting people in such a good mood
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.720]  When they're using your product that build. Oh, it's okay. I'm sure it'll get better
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.920]  It's I I really I feel like that's iphone 10 and iphone
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.520]  eight
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.080]  And I really think it makes sense to me
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:31.240]  the as the time goes on with iphone 10 in my hand and in my pocket it
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:39.560]  It makes sense to me strategically why it debuted alongside the almost technically equivalent iphone 8
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.760]  family
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.480]  And I don't think like like in the back of my head ever since this it became clear they were going to do this
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.480]  I wondered whether
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.800]  It was sort of like well the iphone 10 can be ready a year of head of schedule
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.420]  So here it is and I know that there was talk of that with the interviews that like panzerino
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.480]  And the others had that, you know, maybe originally it was sort of the 28 2018 product
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.640]  But why not cancel the iphone 8 instead?
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.160]  And part of it is is the number they could produce but I think even if if it were less even much less
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.800]  Constrained I still think it would have debuted alongside the iphone 8
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.200]  I think they needed to have a new product at a top tier at those price points
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.400]  Which they couldn't sell this one at because like you said just for example, the the oled screen is more than double the price
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.560]  but I also think
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.560]  from a
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.880]  A customer perspective and and how do you deal with?
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.520]  A customer base that measures in the hundreds of millions like iphone does
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:49.880]  Uh, how do you move to something that's as as much new and introduces as many imperfections as iphone 10?
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.160]  Uh
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  I I think it could paralyze most companies. I think it's I think it's sort of to me
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:03.800]  It's sort of what happened to microsoft with windows is that they they got they built such a massive user base of normal people
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.720]  who have
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.360]  not just no enthusiasm for radical changes to the experience but
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.000]  But are outright hostile to the idea of major changes to the experience
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:23.100]  And so I really think strategically it makes sense that they introduced it alongside again an almost technically equivalent
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  Product with the same a11
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.320]  processor
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320]  almost the same camera system
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.400]  um
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  But I mean
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:41.000]  A user experience that is like you as you said iteratively refined year after year after year from that original iphone
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.000]  Yeah, I think I completely agree I and and I think your point about
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:52.680]  This gives them more permission to make this sort of radical change if that makes sense
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.080]  Because you know what you're buying for and you're paying more for it
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.840]  So if you if you don't like the iphone 10's interface, it's like it's your own damn fault
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.560]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:06.200]  And there's this we talked about this a few like when I was on the podcast previously in the context of alexa and siri
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.720]  where
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.440]  I I talked about the fact that yes siri is trying to be more in depth and you can
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.840]  Use natural language and they'll figure it out
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.740]  Whereas alexa is very prescriptive and formulaic
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:25.080]  And I I told you at the time and and maybe you've come around my position now is I actually think the alexa approach is better
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:30.120]  In that when when alexa doesn't work you as a user feel like it's your fault
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:35.960]  But not in a bad way not and I feel bad. It's in a oh this cool interface isn't quite working
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.920]  I guess I did it wrong. Let me figure it out and i'll do it again as opposed to siri which way over
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.120]  Promises and under delivers like there's there's this aspect of like if you're going to be dealing with something
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.160]  That's going to be buggy and problematic. It's almost better
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.360]  You you don't want to say you're going to be great and then not be great because the expectations get all messed up
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.520]  whereas like my expectations for
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.280]  alexa and siri when it comes to like that sort of interaction are very different and it's it's
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:07.720]  Fascinating that actually the technically superior product and i'm sorry alexa is so much better than siri
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:11.720]  If you think about the technical aspects of accuracy and speed like it just blows it out of the water
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.160]  but but even
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.360]  The fact that siri is quote unquote more capable as far as like interpreting the commands
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:26.440]  That's actually a bad thing and and to me the iphone 10 is the anti-siri like siri is the one tech product in my life that
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:33.980]  Consistently makes me like enrages me not in a like like in a where it triggers that visceral reaction
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.960]  And it's usually when it screws up and it says something cutesy. It's like
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:45.080]  Look, just just screw up. Don't be cutesy about it. You know what I mean? And it makes the flaws worse
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:51.320]  Whereas the iphone 10 by triggering the opposite emotion that emotion of oh, this is so cool that that happiness emotion
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:56.760]  It it over it. It smooths over the flaws in a way. I'm willing to tolerate them in a way
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.600]  I don't tolerate them with siri at all
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:04.280]  So we could we could spend the rest of the show arguing about this and my typical way of arguing with you on this
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.280]  Point is is
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.880]  is to get
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:12.920]  technical or detailed and have specific examples and and tell you the times when I asked
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.360]  Alexa for
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.520]  The betting line on a sports game and she couldn't do it and siri could and blah blah blah
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:24.360]  But I think that your point and i'm listening to you and I think you have a point here where I think me arguing that
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:31.800]  Would be talking right over your argument, which is that if siri infuriates you and makes you angry and alexa doesn't it's all
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.640]  That's all the really the argument that there is you know, and I trust that you're given both an honest try and that you haven't
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640]  Just prejudged it
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.680]  You know because you're a homer for amazon, which I can't see why anybody would ever think that you are
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.280]  But you know what? I mean? Like I don't have any suspicion that you are and therefore I think that the points already made
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.520]  you know what I mean, and and it's sort of like if you
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.080]  had a you know
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.680]  Brand x automobile and I think brand x automobiles are are
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:04.920]  Terrible because they're supposed they're always breaking down. Everybody I know has one is has to get it fixed twice a year
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.920]  And you're telling me how much you love it
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.480]  It doesn't mean that you're wrong. Right? You still might love it. It's you know, the emotional
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:19.560]  Reaction these products give us are should be considered part of the experience if not the maybe the primary part of the experience
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.280]  Yeah, I mean I
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:28.680]  Previously i've always had the technical argument with you where I think that you have to measure these services again based on accuracy and speed
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.720]  And whereas like getting a specific answer wrong
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.160]  That's almost more a function of did they bother to probe the program that in or not or has you know as the algorithm sort of
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:43.000]  Figured it out and I think but that's easy to see it's easy to see. Oh siri screwed up this answer. Well, okay, that's fine
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.760]  I'm more concerned that siri took two seconds to respond. Whereas alexa took half a second
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:53.640]  If that makes sense and the fact that you know, alexa always understands me, but you're right the part the argument making now is actually a step
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.800]  Beyond that when alexa gets something wrong. She just she's just like, uh,
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.240]  I can't do that or I don't know or it is very short and brief and it's like and she it's very straightforward
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:07.080]  It's like I don't know how to do that or I I don't get that or if I say alexa
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.640]  I use it for the lights all the time alexa turn off the living room
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.240]  And it says okay, and then the lights don't turn off
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.680]  Like it's like then I just say it again alexa's trying to live your man. It's annoying but whatever I I quickly forget about it
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:24.840]  Whereas siri's like siri, please do this like oh don't forget like setting a timer, right?
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.040]  It's serious that time for one minute. Okay, I set a timer for two minutes. Remember a watched pot never boils
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.080]  Some crap like that and it's like it's like if you had just screwed up
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.920]  It would have been okay or if you put the fat if you tell siri to cancel the timer
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.920]  She'll be like, okay, but don't forget
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.480]  oh, I know it's
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:48.120]  it is infuriating especially because when I whenever I tell siri to cancel a timer it's usually because
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.760]  Siri screwed up setting the timer in the first place
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.720]  And it's it's almost like and I think but I can understand why apple did this because it's like
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.360]  It's a high risk high reward game like the iphone 10 is a big risk and in reaching for delight
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.240]  And I think it's clear to see that series cutesy answers is a reach for delight
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.240]  The problem is if it goes wrong
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.260]  It goes really wrong in a way that a sort of more sort of like functional utilitarian
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:20.300]  approach does not and I think the the balance is and where apple screw this up is you take that approach you take that high-risk
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.420]  approach of reaching for a delightful experience
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:29.340]  You have it works much better in something where you control almost every aspect and you can ensure it's great
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:31.020]  And that's why I was getting at this week
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.260]  Well about the the hardware and software integration still matters because apple controls so much about the iphone 10
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.740]  They can get it far more easily than the iphone 10
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:45.660]  But if they don't control so much about the iphone 10 they can get it far enough down the competency curve
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:49.740]  That the delight can take over and the problem with siri is not that apple doesn't control the pieces
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:54.380]  It's that the inherent to cloud services because there's so many variables. There's so many things going on
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:19:02.140]  They can never control it sufficiently to deliver the level of experience such that it delights like it can only be bad
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:07.980]  It's either it's either good enough or it's bad. Whereas whereas when they control everything it can be good enough
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:13.660]  Great, and and I think for apple learning to draw that distinction about when they should go for it when they should go for delight
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.460]  Versus when they should seek to be competent
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.260]  Like that gets at sort of the challenges the differences between services and between products
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.620]  Uh, that's a great point
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.900]  uh, I think part of the delight in the iphone 10
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.700]  is the
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:34.400]  thoughtfulness quality implementation of the animations
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:39.760]  Um, yes, no that yes, that's exactly it. It's not like I talk about face id, but no, I I just want sorry
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.800]  I sorry you you go first and I well, I already completely agree with you. I
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.080]  I I can't even articulate it. I don't have
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.600]  You know, there's there's fade in and fade out animations for bounces and stuff. I think you know, i'm not
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.560]  I have to like look up that lingo but just you know
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.040]  What accelerates when you pull it down at what rate when you when you pull up?
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.120]  When you pull up?
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.480]  On the notifications and you like you only see the most recent one and you just pull up on the screen a little bit
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.480]  To see the earlier today section and just the way that they fade in
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.800]  um
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.640]  certainly the way the big one I I and it's essential to the to the interface of getting rid of the the
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:25.200]  The essential button the home button and replacing it with this swipe up gesture
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.520]  on a home indicator
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.440]  Every single thing you do with that animation is just perfect. I mean
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.760]  I guess I wouldn't be surprised to find out that they could improve it even further on what I thought was perfect
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.600]  it was in fact, you know could still be improved further but
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.640]  Uh, it just feels perfect
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.640]  it just seems so right the way that the difference between flipping up quickly to go back to the home screen and flipping up slowly
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.640]  to go to the card interface for switching
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.880]  every aspect of it and the haptic feedback that you get when you get to the uh,
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.960]  The card switching mode it there. I I don't know. I I didn't really
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.080]  This is the whole thing. You can't articulate it. You can only feel it right and I don't I don't know what is
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.720]  I don't know. What is actually superior hardware and what is uh
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.200]  Just good timing on the software part like for example, like I said when you get to the
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.280]  When you get to the card interface when you're swiping up you're in an app
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.600]  You're in safari and you pull up a little bit to the card interface. There's this tiny little bit of haptic feedback
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.160]  and it's
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.120]  It's so little that I didn't even I didn't really even think about it for like a day or two after I had the phone
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.120]  I'm playing with it and it like i'm looking I was so visually obsessed with it
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.440]  I didn't really think about that bit of haptic feedback
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.720]  And then once I thought about it and kept playing it with it over and again
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.200]  it's just the just the right amount and it just feels like
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.160]  It just feels like an essential part of that experience and I don't know
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:59.520]  If there's a better more fine-grained haptic engine taptic engine, whatever they call it in this phone
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.280]  or if they've just it's the same as in the iphone 8 and it just
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.800]  They were just using it in a way that is perfectly timed in software
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.520]  But either way it's you know, it's the experience that matters and it's perfect
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.560]  So I have a small point and a big point. The small point is apple's demos of multitasking are really bad
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.760]  Yes, it took me a while to figure out how to do how to do it
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.520]  What is all you have to do is to exit the app?
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.200]  You just swipe up and your thumb naturally leaves the screen to enter multitasking. Just hold your thumb on the screen, right?
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.760]  And and and so it's the exact same motion. You don't have to change that do this weird like
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:38.480]  Rotational thumb gesture that they suggest in their videos you just hold up and keep your thumb on the screen and then you what happens?
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.360]  Is you feel that haptic feedback you're referring to and the moment you feel the haptic feedback. You're now in the card interface
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.520]  You can let go your thumb and it becomes like once you figure out how to do it. It's super natural
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:54.960]  But it's almost like apple's demos actually let them down here and and it it works out very well. That's a small point
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.040]  the large point is what this bit about the like the
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.160]  Responsiveness of touch has to be so utterly perfect on this phone for it to work
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.360]  The only way the interface works is that the the response was just it has to absolutely nail it and even little stuff like
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:16.160]  I've reached ability enabled where you have to swipe on like the bottom like a portion of the bar on the bottom
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.520]  Which sounds really complicated?
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:24.480]  But I do it flawlessly every time like the the level of accuracy and responsiveness is just it has to be perfect and you think back
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.920]  What's the number one thing that drives I buy a new Android phone every year?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.080]  What's the number one thing that drives me absolutely batty about Android and has from the day Android came out to the latest pixel phone?
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.840]  It's the responsiveness of touch
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.120]  Yeah, the responsiveness and particularly scrolling in these sort of gestures and it's it's infinitesimal
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:47.120]  But you feel it just in the normal interface and like it's it's very difficult
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.680]  I'm sure someone on Android is gonna build face ID like that that's going to happen and I'm sure it'll work fine
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.760]  I'm sure it'll probably Samsung like Samsung is a very capable company, but to
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.640]  to deliver this sort of interface in a way that is not
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:07.040]  Frustrating but is actively fun is actively delightful. We're just literally just using this phone is fun
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.760]  like that's really something that only Apple Apple can do and and
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  Again, it's been so revelatory like when they're in a situation where they can control it all their strengths can so come to the forefront
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:25.120]  In a way that that that when we thought I suspect I mentioned about looking backwards. It was seemed so wonderful
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]  I suspect it never really was wonderful
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:34.400]  we were just so delighted at the time that we overlooked a huge ton of bugs and over the last couple years as the
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.720]  Experience is kind of stagnated
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.880]  Those bugs have become so much more
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.040]  Central in sort of like your experience of using the phone not because they're necessarily more or worse although they might be
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.040]  but just because what else is going on yeah, and then the
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.800]  Joyfulness of this gestural interface
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:00.320]  To me again to draw that connection to the original iPhone is the modern equivalent of
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.720]  the
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.240]  The GUI that way yeah that that no, but the textured
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:15.520]  I'm trying to avoid the s-word, but I'll just say it the skeuomorphic elements of the the original iPhone interface the the leather for the calendar
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.360]  the
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360]  three-dimensional
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:25.200]  Shading and coloring of the buttons just you know the texture and the the depth within an app
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.320]  Just had a playfulness and a joyfulness to them of oh my god look at how beautiful this is right
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.360]  It's this the hardware was this incredibly
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.600]  stark
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.920]  You know glass steel aluminum
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.600]  Thing with this software that was
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:52.160]  So, you know lickable, you know with these buttons that glowed blue and and had 3d texture and stuff to me
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.880]  this gestural thing is the equivalent of that with the
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760]  you know post ios 7 interface
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.120]  And almost makes me think if that was part of the inspiration for the ios 7
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.760]  Redesign that they wanted to go to more of us, you know
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.880]  Put the joy in a different aspect of it
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.720]  Like i'm not saying that this would be I don't know that they made but they and you think about it
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:20.480]  That's when they add in more of these sort of like swipe to go to to uh, or yeah
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.520]  I could see that but they didn't really deliver on it until
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.800]  Until this do you find yourself switching between apps just by swiping left and right on the home indicator?
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.360]  So that's one of my complaints
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.000]  so the problem I have with it is
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.800]  If you switch quickly
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.320]  Then it's actually left and right so you go left to the previous app and then right to the app you're in if you delay
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:48.240]  More than five seconds or so in the app you switch to then your previous app is now to the left of where you are
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:55.600]  Yeah, so if spatially it's very problematic like I I can see the challenge like I would prefer that they're always in the same places
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600]  So I know where I am at all times
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.280]  But at the same time if you pick up the phone later
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.480]  Like it's kind of weird if you're in the middle of the stack. You're not at the very front of it
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:09.360]  It's weird the fact it's weird if most recently used is not not on top or or right right most if you if you prefer
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.800]  But the problem is is that it should be either one
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:20.560]  They need a bigger like it's just weird that literally 10 seconds after 10 seconds the placement of your previously used app will be different
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.480]  So if you're if does that make sense
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.680]  So if you're in an app and then you swipe left and immediately swipe right you go back to your original app
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.280]  And then you swipe left and immediately swipe right you go back to your original app if you're in an app and you swipe left
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.280]  And you wait
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.800]  Five to ten seconds and then you try to swipe right the apps gone
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.160]  It's actually now to the left of that app if if that makes sense
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:42.560]  Yeah
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.480]  and and if you think about it it actually what they've implemented an iPhone 10 for the switching is
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.000]  Although it left to right is flipped. It's exactly like command tab switching
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.720]  where
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.280]  when you open command tab and just keep holding down the command button and
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.920]  that's you see the switcher and you can switch and go to the fourth app the fifth app the sixth app and
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.840]  It's selected but you still haven't let go of the command key
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.080]  you can add the shift key to do a shift command tab and it goes to the left one like if you overshoot and
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.600]  That's the logic of what they've done
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:25.480]  So if you swipe from left to right on the home indicator to go to the most recent second swipe swipe swipe swipe to get
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.840]  To the fourth most recent app
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:32.640]  But you realize you've overshot by one you can swipe the other way and go back to the one that you just overshot
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.680]  But once you wait just like letting go of the command key and command tab switching it
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.160]  Resets and whatever you just selected becomes the new leftmost app most recently used app
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.880]  But the way the reason that it that so logically it works like command tab switching
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.360]  but the reason that nobody complains about command tab switching and the reason why I agree with you that the way this works is
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:01.800]  problematic is that command tab switching is completely visual you see the whole command tab switcher while your command tab switching and
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:06.160]  Then the command tab switcher once you've made a selection and let go of all the keys
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:09.560]  It goes away and you understand that at that point
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:13.600]  It's been reset and whatever you just selected is leftmost
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.640]  Whereas when you're swiping left and right you don't really get like an overview like that to give you a visual sense of
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.360]  What the current order is and when that order is going to switch. Yep. That's that's exactly right
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:34.640]  I think my I would probably prefer they go back to the previous version where it's just like it's always the same order or
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.640]  Now I always say more but whatever app you're in is always the rightmost app. Like I just think conceptually
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:46.660]  Even though it's it's very neat when you're switching back and forth to go left and right and you it feels very visceral and very
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:52.160]  Like because you're in a spatial sort of frame, right? It's like the original Mac OS like that's very spatially oriented
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:59.120]  The problem is the that transition to okay, you're no longer in a spatial place. You're in a like list place
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.740]  It's just it's too it's too hard to keep track of where you are in your head
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:08.620]  I would prefer to standardize even if it's even if the that one use case is not as good as it could be
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:13.200]  But to have it always be that leftist previous app, whatever that whatever that might might have been
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.680]  Yeah, I do find myself using it a lot though
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:23.360]  But I find myself most happy when I'm switching to what I know was my most recently used app like two or three apps
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:27.080]  You know within that switcher and then for anything more than that
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.660]  I
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.640]  My instinct right? I feel like the habit I have to get out of if I want to fish a
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:37.120]  Not quite recently used app, but I know it's in there somewhere
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.520]  I got to get my train myself to go to that
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:45.400]  Switcher where you can see them as opposed to just swiping on the thing at the bottom, but do you hear what you just said though?
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.680]  I
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:51.160]  Can't let go of the lack the Syria argument. Okay said you're going to train yourself to do it
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:56.080]  And and if you think about it objectively, why would you ask your user to train themselves?
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.740]  That sounds very, you know, like you should make it easy for them very simple, etc. And that's the sort of like
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.320]  That's that makes sense at a sort of basic level
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.280]  But what this is what's so great with the iPhone 10 you are going to train yourself
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:14.800]  Like if that sounds terrible, but you don't feel bad about that, right? You're you're like, oh, I'll figure this out
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.280]  Well and to me that's that's a great place
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:23.440]  That's a that's a great place to be from a product where your users are putting in work to figure out your product
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.200]  But it doesn't feel like work to them. It feels like something that that this is what I'll do
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.560]  Yeah, and I don't you know
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.320]  It's mostly about I feel like trying to figure out the way that I'm supposed to use the system
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:42.680]  Instead of fighting and my favorite analogy to this is Mac OS 10 the switch from classic Mac OS to Mac OS 10
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.180]  Was so humongous from the user interface perspective and so many things that used to work
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.680]  one way now worked another and
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:55.920]  I honestly believe even to this day you and Syracuse the lost your mind
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:02.760]  Well, we didn't either of us lost our mind it but a lot of people I think who are less analytical than Syracuse
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:04.760]  and I are
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.680]  lost their minds
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  and I think that I
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.400]  Could go down the list
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:17.640]  But I think that Syracuse and I could win every single argument about the ways that classic Mac OS had a better
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.640]  system wide interface than Mac OS 10
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:22.680]  But
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:26.080]  Here's my point though. My point though is even though I believe that that was true and
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:30.800]  and there was a whole cottage industry in the early days of Mac OS 10 of
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:37.200]  You know, we call utilities taxis, you know at low-level system hacks that hacked the system to make things more like
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.360]  Mac OS 9 and you could get the window shade and you could you know where you used to be where you double-click the top
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:50.600]  Of a window and everything but the the title bar of the window would disappear so you could quickly go to something underneath it
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:55.760]  And then double-click that that window again, you know a window shade the whole window would just zap up into the top bar
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.520]  And Mac OS 10 got rid of that
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.400]  Well, there was a hack see that could restore it and if you could get down the list dozens and dozens of things
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:08.840]  My colleague I was at bare-bones offer at the time Steve Kalkwarf
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.320]  Who was it's felt as strong as strongly as I did about a lot of these things about Mac OS 9 said
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:16.640]  If you really want to be happy with Mac OS 10
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.280]  the way you and he used to work at Apple he worked at Apple and left for bare-bones and
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.480]  But his to his argument was you should try to at least at least
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:30.740]  Use it long enough to figure out how they want you to use it before you start adding the hacks
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:32.740]  Don't just look at it and in an hour
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.800]  Add as many hacks ease as you can to go back to what you're familiar with
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.840]  Use it as it ships as they intend you to use it and try to figure out and again
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.920]  It's not like something that typical user is going to do is try to figure out how a software designers at Apple meant to you
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.560]  To use it
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.360]  but if you're the type of person who can do that you should try to figure out how it's supposed to be used and
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.040]  Then make up your mind later and a lot of times and over the years, you know
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:02.280]  I at least I I've you know found that it was better to stop fighting the fighting it and go in even if I thought
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.760]  It was the wrong decision
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.960]  Yeah, because there's so much about about software in general
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:09.000]  This applies to businesses where you know
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:16.160]  The very underlying underpinnings of OS 10 were so different from Mac OS right and and Mac OS was very much a sort of you
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:21.600]  Know an integrated product in many respects all from the from the from the foundation of the software and not just hardware and software
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.060]  But how the very operating system was put together
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:30.400]  All the way up to the interface and you know, what was the big was the big fundamental technical fault with OS with Mac OS
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.800]  Like unprotected memory right and all like all these applications were using the same shared memory space of one crash
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.760]  The whole thing would go down. Well, if you think about it, that was almost like the interface too, right?
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.480]  It was this really fully
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.920]  Integrated sort of experience and OS 10 if you think about the technical level
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.280]  It was much like separate processes and all these things were separated and different and it was much more there was more structure
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.920]  Imposed on on it from a technical perspective and that actually happened in the interface as well
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.880]  There was a much more structure put around it and I actually think if anything the attempts to tack on
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.680]  Mac OS user interface conventions were some of the worst parts of early OS 10 like OS 10 was so in part
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.560]  This is I used to be a Windows user so it was easier for me
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.920]  OS 10 was so much better and enjoyable if you just embrace like opening the finder and it's a folder view as opposed to
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.520]  Trying to preserve like spatialness, right?
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.960]  Because in in why did that spatialist always fall apart and I know you and this is one of the favorite complaints of both you
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.120]  And Sir Q so it was like, you know
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:32.000]  It's always different every time if you change this or change that it's because they were trying to put on something that was fundamentally
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:39.040]  Misaligned with the underlying structure. I made that and hack it right? It would have been better argument. Well like a
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880]  15 or 6. Oh, yeah
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.440]  I've read almost everything you've written. It's inevitable
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.560]  No, but my argument was if they wanted to have a browser file browser style interface
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.160]  Then it should have been entirely a file browser and there shouldn't have been any attempt to mimic
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:55.820]  I agree with you, but I think the same is true of of iPhone
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:02.040]  10 and I think it's why again just go back to my point from a couple minutes ago of why they're selling this alongside the
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.040]  familiar iPhone 8
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:08.480]  I think a typical customer once this thing is out of supply constraints and you can just go into the Apple Store and
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.540]  Buy an iPhone 10 or any iPhone 8 you want in any color you want?
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.440]  When you're you know, your contracts up or your old phone broke and you come in and you say well
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.720]  I'm intrigued by this
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.720]  iPhone 10 I've heard it's awesome and
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:26.480]  the salesperson you pick it up or maybe you know, maybe the salesperson isn't there and you pick it up and you tap home and
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.300]  Nothing happens and you're like what the hell and they're like, oh, yeah now you have to swipe and there's in you're like
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:37.440]  Well, how do you get to multitasking? Do you double tap down there? And they're like, oh no, it's an all new thing
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.520]  you have to you know do the swipe and
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.400]  I think there's an awful lot of people and they're like, well would they have to do that with iPhone 8 and they're like
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:50.160]  Nope, iPhone 8 acts works exactly the way you're used to I think that that person is like give me an iPhone 8. I
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.920]  Really do a great point because because Apple's Apple's customer base is so large at this point and the point I made previously
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.480]  There's this famous sort of like framework from like a long time ago
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:06.800]  But it's very well known in tech about called crossing the chasm and this idea there being sort of early adopters and and and technical
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.000]  inclined people and then there's a chasm which you get to the normal users and
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.920]  The laggards and stuff like that and a point that I've always made it. I think a mistake that's made people applying this is
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:25.520]  To presume that only the people at the head of the curve want the expensive product. That's not necessarily that's not necessarily true
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.320]  The people behind the curve aren't seeking to be cheap per se they're seeking to not have problems
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.880]  I think they don't they don't want to deal with they just want it to work, right? It's a phone
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.640]  they just wanted to function and what I think something that's been underappreciated about Apple is accomplished with the iPhone is
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.360]  For sure. They have a huge portion of early adopters
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.680]  But if anything that's where Android is the most competitive particularly high-end Android right because people those people like to fidget
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.220]  They like all they like to be able to adjust everything have total control and to have that sort of seamless integration with with
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:57.200]  Google services and all that sort of things which is which is genuine
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.260]  I mean Google using Google services is way better on an Android
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:04.360]  that's by far the best thing about using an Android if you're if you're a regular Google user, but
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.120]  Apple's also has this huge base in this in this sort of
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.640]  Conventional user that just wants their phone to work and and I think that's the point you're making is for that base
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:21.760]  Man, the iPhone 8 is a way better product than than the iPhone 10 is. Yep. I really do think so
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.680]  I I did the longer I've had this the more sir more I think that that's true
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.080]  All right, I want to thank our next sponsor it's our
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.720]  Good friends at fracture
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.320]  fracture makes photo prints and
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:44.040]  They are thoughtful unique gifts. You take photos you have photos. They're all on your phone. They're in your iCloud account
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.520]  They're they're all digital digital digital
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.880]  you could take them send them to fracture and
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.060]  They will print them directly on glass. Now. These guys have sponsored the show for a long time
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.840]  You've heard me say before I'm gonna say it again
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.240]  these make
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:08.160]  Fantastic gifts. This is maybe the best tip. I'm gonna give you your good friend John Gruber a daring fireball
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.160]  I'm gonna give you this tip right now
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:17.880]  Fracture prints make great gifts. Now. This show is being recorded on November 8th, probably air
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:21.160]  November 9th, November 10th mid-november
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:29.160]  Fracture has just sent me an update before this show is recorded where they literally say this is a word from fracture
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.360]  We are experiencing some pretty high volume already for the holidays
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:38.600]  So you may want to encourage folks to place their orders early to make sure they get them in time for the holidays. I
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:45.200]  Can't emphasize enough. They can't keep up. These things are handmade in Gainesville, Florida from US source materials
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:52.480]  They can't just up the volume in mid-december or maybe even early December to keep up with holiday demand
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.480]  So you're gonna kick yourself if you ignore me if you're thinking hey
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.700]  My folks would love some pictures of the grandkids. My wife would love
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.320]  Some photos of the dog
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:11.800]  Everybody in our family might love if I get some fracture prints of the great vacation. We took last summer
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:18.700]  Anything you could do to please the members of your family your friends that you could do with a fracture print
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.340]  Go do it now take some time
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:28.660]  Right now or tonight or tomorrow, but not don't put it off. Don't put it off until later because you might end up too late
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:33.020]  For the holidays and I'm telling you these things are absolutely
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.660]  fantastic products
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:39.600]  Fantastic quality prints and the ordering process could not be more simple
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.420]  it's a simple fun way to order a print and
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:49.980]  Everything you need comes in the package ready to go out of the box. They even include the wall hanger
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:56.200]  Also, you can feel good about this sort of purchase because fracture is a green company operating a carbon-neutral factory

[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.720]  Ben are you back? Oh, sorry. I hadn't you turned on
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.000]  To the benefit of everyone I think we've covered the big picture on this well enough
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.880]  I think we should get into some of our grapes about this phone and these imperfections that we alluded to before
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.140]  I'm imagining that there are some people out there who don't have their iPhone 10 yet
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.040]  Who've literally not paid attention to a word we've said in the last
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:10.840]  45 to 50 minutes from when we brought up the serious imperfections and we haven't really mentioned them yet. Well
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:17.240]  We did we did talk about the the I think the multitasking isn't fully thought out in both both dimensions
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:22.040]  So one we already talked about that left right swipe is kind of is kind of weird and that it how it changes
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.400]  I think that needs to be fixed and then just even though I explained that getting to the cards is
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.700]  That swipe up and then you keep your finger on the screen
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:34.780]  It's too slow and I just find myself using multitasking far less than I did before
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:38.180]  Like I'm back to the iPhone close the app open the app
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:44.840]  I want to go to sort of thing and that's it's a little frustrating cuz I was a massive heavy sort of multitasking user before
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:52.200]  Can I say this that I I think multitasking in general is one of those things where I think the iOS in particular
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.300]  But even Android I think that the touch-based
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.640]  mobile
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.380]  revolution has made personal computing so much more relevant to
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:07.920]  more people around the world's whether they were felt, you know thought that they were
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:12.780]  Technically lost using Windows or Macs or whether they previously loved Windows or Macs
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:16.280]  but even love this more and the reason why you see things like
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:26.220]  I think with Facebook in particular you it's like they don't even talk about the mobile desktop split because the desktop side is like
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.700]  irrelevant it they could have you know
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:33.540]  They could only count the mobile use and that's all that matters and it's not just because people have their phones with them
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:39.580]  It's just it's just better for most people most aspects of touch-based iOS and Android style computing
[01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:46.900]  It's just cognitively better for most people. But the one thing that no mobile platform. I think has gotten right yet is
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.220]  Multitasking and that's the one thing that desktop systems do get right. I
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:57.620]  I I just feel like the the way you switch apps and the way you tell what's running and and
[01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:01.500]  What's doing what and how do you get back to the other app is?
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.680]  Invisible on the Mac and it's
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:08.700]  It has it's not just that they've changed it
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:13.380]  It's that they had no aspect in iOS since they even had multitasking have they had gotten it, right?
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:21.460]  Yeah, I mean, but but I think it's actually but the thing is I agree and it's also worse now like it that double-click
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:28.020]  and immediately go into that card view it because it you get that visual component that you talked about in terms of command tab and
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.500]  You get it really fast
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:36.220]  the problem now is you either have the fast switching which is this the left right swipe where you have no visual components and
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:42.060]  It's confusing or you can get the visual component, but it takes too long. It's just an action
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:48.820]  I find myself not doing very often because it just it I mean it takes too long as a matter of microseconds
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:54.620]  but it's it's meaningful and and maybe I will do more once I'm more used to the gesture, but I
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:45:00.460]  I'm actually you kind of mentioned this before in terms of doing the iPhone 10 first. I'm actually
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:07.000]  Super duper interested in what iOS 12 is going to be like because I think so much of the interface
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:08.180]  You know
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:12.940]  Needs to be rethought not just because the screen size because the plus has been around for a while and I think there's changes that
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:20.220]  Have been needed be made for a while to accommodate that but just in general particularly this focus on gestures as the controlling element
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:26.780]  I'm really interested to see if that leads to a sort of new overhaul in iOS and it's funny because
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:35.960]  it's obviously a very deliberate choice on Apple's part to require a gesture either just the swipe on the home indicator or the
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960]  Swipe up to go to the card interface
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:43.380]  Because they could have allowed you to double tap the indicator to get to multitasking mode
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:48.300]  In a way and I can kind of see why they didn't do that for the home screen
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:54.980]  but I I'm not quite sure why they didn't do it for getting to the multitasking switcher and you can prove that it could be
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:46:01.100]  Happened because every time you tap just tap on the home indicator it bounces a little so that knows you're tapping on it
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:05.620]  So you could just tap twice on it and see it do two very subtle little bounces
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.500]  I
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:13.580]  Don't know I kind of I kind of agree with you that just to get to the card switcher if I could double tap on
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:15.580]  That little capsule it might be better
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:21.020]  Yeah, that's I never noticed a little bounce, but it's a good point. I'm gonna predict
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:29.300]  That you're not happy about the change in control centers trigger location. Oh man, like I was I
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:33.060]  I I mean, this was a talk about fulfilling expectations
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:38.540]  I was already very perturbed when I heard the news because so I use it's funny
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:44.140]  I I tweeted about this about a left being a person. I worded the tweet very carefully
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:50.200]  I'm said I said I'm a person who uses the iPhone with my left hand and the reason I did that is because I knew I'd
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.200]  get an outpouring of
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:58.500]  Solidarity from people who are actually left-handed like all us poor left-handed users and I do say I'm actually right-handed
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:03.600]  So I I hear about your pain, but I can't empathize but in this one case, I totally get it
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:07.240]  I use the iPhone my left hand and I used to use control center all the time
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.340]  Particularly. I mean I just use it constantly
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:14.880]  It's one of my most used things on the phone by far and it is utterly and completely unusable now
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.600]  I mean, yes and be like, oh you can trigger a reach ability and then swipe down like that's a ridiculous gesture
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.820]  I have to do this little gesture on the bottom and this reach across the top three down. Yeah control center is a big problem
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:32.200]  Sorry, that was a very that was a very unstructured complaint because I because I feel so strongly about how bad it is
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:41.680]  I'm a right-handed iPhone user when I'm using it one-handed and even I have to I generally I often have to regrip the phone
[01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:42.300]  meaning
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:49.020]  you know shimmy up the shimmy up your phone so my thumb can get there and as as you know, you know you I mean
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.780]  I I'm not you
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:56.900]  Humongous human being but I'm six foot two and if anything I have slightly larger than average
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.660]  fingers if not hands
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:04.800]  We should I should ask our friend of the show Craig Hockenberry whether he's able to one-handedly reach
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:10.420]  Control center at all times should ask Bill de Blasio. Yeah, I should have I wonder if he had an iPhone
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:15.780]  so the the other thing that is a little frustrating about the whole control center thing is
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:23.020]  The control center is a very narrow part of the top like it's only that top ear. Whereas the rest of the top is
[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:30.500]  Is the notification and I I just don't bring up notifications when I'm in the I love notifications
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:35.220]  And actually this gets another completely to a moment. I like notification on the lock screen is one of my favorite things
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:37.900]  Or I use it all the time
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:45.660]  but the the fact that notifications it dominates the top of the screen and control center is very small when I use control center way
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:48.740]  Maybe I'm just alone in this. I mean Apple has Apple has these sorts of numbers
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.140]  They know how much particular things are used
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:52.140]  but it just seems weird that
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:57.380]  That's only that little bit and even if it had to be at the top if you could make control center larger and switch to
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:01.700]  The left side it would be it would definitely be be more tolerable to answer
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:06.700]  what I know is a very frequently answer question because I get asked it on Twitter and stuff like that for people who are
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:11.420]  still on the fence about their iPhone 10 or have their iPhone 10 pre-order still in the
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:19.220]  It pending mode and so they haven't used it is that the the notch is a touch target
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:23.780]  so for anything you can do at the top of the screen like
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:29.200]  The tap at the top of the screen to scroll up to the top of any scroll view
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:31.780]  You can do that by just tapping the notch
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:36.620]  You don't have to tap one of the ears to do that and to pull down for notification center
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.180]  You can do it right from the middle and it works because the notch even though it's not a display area
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:43.500]  Is a a tappable area?
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:45.620]  and
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:52.420]  So the way that it's divided is that it's the notch plus the left ear is where you can scroll down for tap
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:59.860]  You know pull down to get notification center and it's that right ear where you can get control center and and the thinking clearly
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:02.500]  I mean, I haven't spoken to the person who made this decision
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:05.800]  but it's very obvious to me that the thinking behind it is that it makes
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:13.400]  They they convince themselves. It makes sense because that's the place where the little icons for Wi-Fi and your self
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:19.360]  Strength and your battery life are like so those are the little control center
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.080]  You know, those are parts of control center like turning on Wi-Fi and turning on cellular networking
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:25.920]  and
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.040]  So, you know, I think the end, you know, there's a little you know
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.200]  There's even a little battery button in control center where you can turn on low power mode
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.980]  So that's their thinking is oh, well
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:40.740]  That's where the little things that you the the few things from control center that live in the status bar
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.020]  Permanently are up in the top, right? So that's where you pull down to do it. I
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:52.020]  It doesn't feel like it makes sense to me it feels arbitrary and to me it's because both
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:56.380]  Things it doesn't feel to me like you're pulling down on the Wi-Fi icon to get there
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:01.980]  It just right it just pops into place. It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't slide down like which is which is very weird
[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:07.340]  It it feels like an edge gesture not a tap on this element of the screen gesture
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:10.860]  So the fact that those elements of the screen happened to be in the top, right?
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.720]  Don't really it don't really affect my sensibility of this and of all the habits
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:23.420]  That I've had to change to get used to iPhone 10 the single one that I I'm still making now. Let me think about this
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.300]  nine days in
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:31.980]  The one that I still can't break is swiping up from the bottom on the lock screen to get control center
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:34.740]  For some reason when if I'm actually in the phone
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:38.220]  And using an app and I want to get the control center
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.980]  I'm more likely to remember I have to do it from the top, right?
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.580]  But when I want to just turn on the flashlight or well
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:46.960]  I guess the flashlight you can get from that button now, but something in control center
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.420]  Start turning off Wi-Fi. That's one because I was
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:56.460]  Like when I was on the train, I didn't want the Amtrak Wi-Fi that I was already connected to
[01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.440]  I wanted to just use the cellular networking which should be faster
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.700]  I'm from the lock screen. I
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:09.260]  Can't stop pulling up from the bottom which instead takes me to the home screen because it unlocks with face ID
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.380]  Yeah
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:16.340]  It's clear that they didn't know where to put it like if you think about it. They ran out of edges
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:19.100]  Yeah, they're out of edges. It's stuck in the corner. The animation is wrong
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:24.180]  Like just everything about it is wrong and it and I I'm hopeful. I mean, I don't
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.740]  Not a project at Apple, so I don't know where they should what they should do with it
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:34.020]  But it is a queer sort of like step backwards in functionality and it's actively not better
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:39.500]  right and what I mean from running out of edges is from the top you get notification center and
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:42.340]  Or at least everywhere but the lock screen
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.020]  But they can't have the lock screen
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:51.580]  Control Center be somewhere else than it is in the interface you pull in from the left edge you get the I think they call
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.840]  It today view where you have all your widgets and if you swipe in from the right side you jump to the camera
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.380]  And so there was there's no edge left to just devote to it. I
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:10.140]  Don't know I tend to think maybe what they could have done is swipe in from the right edge and have that work anywhere
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:16.000]  But then there's things like when you're swiping on a row and mail and you want to get those little buttons to archive flag
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.180]  And delete and stuff. I don't know on the home screen doesn't work either because you're I mean well
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:25.380]  They could get they could get rid of the camera swipe and just have that button for camera access in the camera
[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:28.860]  Which camera slip Oh
[01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:34.460]  From the home screen when you swipe from the right you jump right to the camera. I'm not the home screen
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.860]  Oh, you're right on screen. You can do it, right? Yeah. I know the home screens a problem. Yeah
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:42.500]  I was missing home screen locks. I actually didn't I I didn't know that about the lock screen that you could slip in the camera
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:47.420]  I I there's a button there. So I assumed you had to press the button. No, yes, that's worked for years, by the way
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.300]  Intend you didn't know right exactly. Yeah, it's funny
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:59.540]  I never even thought well, you know why though because I always watch the camera from from control center
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:05.300]  Well, you just haven't and so yeah, which I mean it's funny. I just don't yeah
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.140]  It's it's that that one's very frustrating the other thing that kind of goes with this
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:13.680]  Oh, so we should talk about face ID. So face ID is it's incredible
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.460]  Like it works it works and when it works. Well, it's amazing in that bit
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:21.500]  I put in my article where a notification just says you have a notification
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:21.700]  Yeah
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:27.060]  and then when you look at it and the location expands to say what the location actually is so that no so like you get this
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:30.200]  additional layer of privacy for your notifications
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:35.440]  Which which is it's always been a sort of a hang-up right because it's better to have your notifications say something
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:40.440]  But at the same time you've practically compromised all your like for example two-factor identification
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.260]  For those barbaric services like quitter or whatever. We still have to use SMS
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:48.120]  Like it would literally pop up on your notifications what the what the number is
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.760]  Like which is no good and so the and so that's that's a great it's great
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:02.720]  It's like you it's an additional layer of privacy that you didn't even realize was lacking and now it's there and it's it's incredible
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.040]  It's the bet it's computing at its best. So for anybody who bends a little quip there
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.960]  it's a perfect example, but if that blew right past you imagine somebody steals your phone and
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.160]  They're trying to change your Twitter password, but they can't unlock your phone
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.620]  They could go to twitter.com and and do something that triggers it
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:22.480]  Well, you know and let's say they stole your password too and they want to change it
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.320]  Basically use SM that if you're using SMS for trophy instead of an app, which you should use an app
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:32.020]  But some services still you have to use SMS as long as they have your phone in your hand
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:34.960]  They don't have to unlock it the text message that comes with the code
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.480]  They you need the six digit code
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:40.440]  You need to type in it just shows up on the lock screen in the default
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:44.880]  You can turn that off in the old, you know on the iPhone 8 and the earlier funds you can turn that off
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.840]  Most people surely don't know you can turn that off and there's a reason why you're losing
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:54.020]  You're losing all the benefit of the notification screen, which is you can quickly see all the notifications that you got, right?
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:56:01.460]  and even even the fraction of a second where it takes the notifications to change from being private to
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.600]  Unfurling to show you the details of it
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:09.860]  It's it's fast enough where it's not annoying and the fact that you see it happen adds to the joy
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:14.120]  It's like oh, yeah, my happy little iPhone know who's knows who I am and trust me
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:19.440]  So so that's amazing. So face ID and it works. Well, and the other thing about face at face ID
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.240]  That's that's just spectacular is face ID in apps
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:27.700]  So for me like one password is a great example of this where it used to be if you have you know
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:32.520]  If you go you could open one password if it put in you had put in your password and touch ID and then you open
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.900]  A specific account you also have to do it
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:37.480]  I mean you can again something you can turn off but if you want a higher level of
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.600]  Sort of protection and in this case
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.880]  It just happens because you don't have to do the even though it's literally just putting your thumb on the sensor
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:53.320]  It requires some degree of active thought and what's so different about face ID relative touch ID. Is that sort of active?
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:59.560]  That explicit action is eliminated. It's the same thing is happening, but it's totally implicit
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.360]  It's happening without you even knowing about it and it's it's just a great experience
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.360]  I'm and this is one where the people who've been using an iPhone
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.280]  7
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:11.840]  Plus
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:18.300]  Or when did the two camera system come in? I guess with the success success success plus
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.880]  people who've been in the plus Club for a while or like hey dummy, that's why we've been telling you to get a get a
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.720]  plus the
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:32.000]  The camera the pictures that I got over this last weekend with the telephoto lens and portrait mode
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.900]  Some of them in telephone. I just shot portrait mode a lot of the time even when it wasn't technically a portrait
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:45.420]  For shooting human subjects are just phenomenal and I was I was on a weekend trip with my dad
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:47.420]  My dad's turning 80 later this year
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:51.860]  and so I took him on a trip as an early birthday present with my brother-in-law and
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:55.740]  We had an absolute great weekend
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:58:00.820]  We actually we actually did I tell you this we took him to see the Dallas Cowboys
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.780]  My dad's also had like me as a Dallas Cowboys fan had never seen a game in person in Dallas
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:12.780]  Which by the way is is a good thing for you to reveal because it puts your Dallas Cowboys fandom in a little more favorable light
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:16.760]  Still it's not completely favorable, but but a little bit a little bit more
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:21.760]  But it was a beautiful weekend in Dallas a little hot. We got there Friday the game was Sunday
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.960]  We had a just a fantastic time. It's a beautiful city. I'd never been there before we had a great time
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:31.040]  I and I thought before I left should I take a real camera or not?
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:36.820]  This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Well, it doesn't have to be we could go back but you know first time he went trip
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:44.380]  I'm gonna want good pictures. I would be willing to lug around the real camera, you know on a strap or in my pocket
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.080]  all day
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:54.000]  But I thought you know, I trust the iPhone 10 and honest to god the pictures I took they they're as good as the pictures
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  I take with my $2,500
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:02.880]  Canon kit which would say he is a huge camera and a huge huge
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:10.600]  50 millimeter f 1.2 lens or my beloved and honestly more used than my Canon in recent years
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:18.400]  Fuji x100 s which is a great camera and I know is technically better and it's still I even know in certain ways is
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.880]  Better a lot better than the iPhone 10
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:25.540]  But the my keepers the photos like the 20 or 30 really great photos I got out of this are
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.040]  indistinguishable from the pictures I get out of those cameras, it's it's truly phenomenal and
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.680]  having that telephoto lens to get that that
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.480]  truly
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.480]  Natural perspective where it's not wide-angle and it's not super zoomed in and flattened
[01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:48.360]  It's it's just one of my favorite focal lengths. It makes the most difference for humans by far
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:53.240]  Like yeah, you because it doesn't just change and people who aren't photographers may not may not appreciate it
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.320]  Doesn't just yeah, you could zoom in on a 20 millimeter lens lens
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:02.180]  But the like the face is gonna be flatter like there's there's like you're gonna get less definition just by virtue of it
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:05.520]  But the reason the reason though did not just not to go backwards
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:12.280]  But the reason why I praise face ID is because there are also parts of using face ID. That's very frustrating. Okay?
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.320]  What's frustrating?
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:18.960]  So one example is in this there's a little bit of the watch II aspect to this
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:26.680]  Where with the watch like that having to raise to wake if you're not when you're standing it's perfectly acceptable
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.040]  But if you're in different positions like weighing on the couch or in bed or whatever
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:36.320]  To have to move your arm to wake it up or reach over and press a button is it's a pain
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.680]  It's really annoying and you get that with face ID
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:40.040]  sometimes like
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:45.440]  The rise to the rise to wake where the screen just turns on face ID is triggered and it's scanning for your face
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.320]  If you're standing up or sitting up it works great. It doesn't always work if you're in a prone position
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.920]  Shall we say and so you you you can work around it?
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.660]  You can reach over and press the button or you can purposely flip the phone
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:02.680]  But it's adding in this layer of annoyance that was not there with two or in the car
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:04.680]  for example, the cars a great example where
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:07.400]  You have to you have to reach over and press the button again
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:10.620]  I had a stoplight not saying you're moving or anything, but if it's in there like a holder
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:17.280]  There's an aspect where there's much more friction than there was previously. The other thing too is with the
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:26.000]  It it works almost all the time. But if you're like in the dark, I've had a little bit more mixed experience and
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.680]  in particularly like early in the morning or something them alarm goes off and I'm reaching over and I grab it or whatever might be
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:33.520]  or wait at night and
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:39.200]  Where it just it sometimes just doesn't go you're not sure why and that it does happen
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:45.460]  I found it only happens in sort of when it's dark, but in my experience it particularly in bed
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:47.520]  I know I should be using my phone in my bed, but basically
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:52.920]  Bed is where my problems are which don't take that quote out of context, but
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.740]  That's right. Most the frustration has come for me
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.600]  I've found the same thing
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:03.920]  first thing in the morning at least two of the days since I've used this face ID didn't work for me while I was laying
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:09.300]  In bed, and I don't know how much of it is because I'm still laying and my face is sideways and the phone isn't oriented
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.240]  right
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:13.480]  Yeah, I think it was your face being smushed up
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:18.080]  It doesn't work and also I'm also use I'm extremely nearsighted
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:23.240]  So my eyes are just are really bad and so when I don't have my contacts in I hold the phone very close to my
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.160]  Face and I think it's almost too close for face ID
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:32.360]  And so I pull it out and then I almost wonder if I have the problem where my eyes like aren't focused enough because I'm so
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.080]  Blind that is like it's not registering the I'm not sure what's going on
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.200]  But for it's like it it's interesting
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.160]  I should weigh in bed with like contacts in and I'm curious if it might work better if there's something
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:48.240]  To just the way I'm holding the phone to compensate for my terrible eyesight that is triggering these problems
[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:51.000]  But it's definitely a consistent sort of thing
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  And then and then the problem is when you do encounter a problem
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.920]  You have to reach up and hit the side button
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.520]  like there's not that to have that button right there already under your thumb is
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:03.840]  Like it's more effort to overcome a failure if that makes sense
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.440]  It rarely fails
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.880]  But when it does fail the effort to overcome the failure is greater than then then it was I never use the side
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:13.280]  But you don't find that the tap to screen is all you need
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.080]  Does that oh
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:21.900]  Yeah, I didn't even know I didn't didn't even realize then there you go. That's made it worth appearing on the show
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:26.740]  This is why they added this feature. They've added it is new is this new this year. It's new in the 10
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:31.520]  It does not work you on the iPhone 8 either and I don't know if that's I don't know if it's cuz it's expensive
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.040]  And I don't know but I'm telling you it's it's a game changer Ben. No, it's like the watch
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:35.280]  No
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.360]  That is a game teacher is that that actually solves a huge number of issues because the other thing is with the notifications
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:46.600]  The problem is when the notifications are up. I want them to unfurl. I don't want to swipe up
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.920]  I want to stay on the notification swing. I may just I'm just so used to using an iPhone
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.120]  I'm just I'm used to using that. I love that notification screen
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:56.720]  I love knowing everything that happened because again, I mentioned the whole messaging thing like that's the way get a hold of me
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:01.780]  So like basically everything I need to respond to always comes up to notifications and I have email notifications totally turned off
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:06.180]  So the problem is to swipe up it dismisses notifications and then yes
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:11.400]  I can reach up and bring them back down but but particularly if I'm already in an app all those
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.000]  notifications disappear from the list and then it's kind of a mess so
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:20.900]  Waking up the phone and making it do face ID without me having to swipe up and trigger face ID
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:23.720]  Is has been a big problem so that actually might fix it
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:26.680]  Yeah, it's in the best way to think of it is exactly like to watch
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:33.000]  It's like it's like there might be some other examples, but it's like a watch ISM that has come to to iPhone 10
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.640]  But it's only on the 10 and I've gotten used to it because I I don't know where I don't know if it stuck out
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:39.840]  To me in the keynote or what?
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:44.580]  I think it maybe it stuck out to me during Schiller's bit in a keynote where I was like, you know
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:46.120]  I've had that thought before
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.880]  Where once I got used to the watch I I was like, why can't I wake my phone that way?
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.920]  Why why can't I just tap the screen if the watch can do it?
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.920]  And so I was intrigued by it and had it in mind
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.880]  And so I've been using it ever since they gave me the iPhone 10, but anybody out there is in the same boat as Ben
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:03.080]  I'm telling you it's a game changer. You don't need that side button
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:07.880]  Yeah, the situation in the car in particular. I can see that being really useful. Yeah
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:14.200]  Just tap the screen you look at it. I found Apple pay. I have found Apple pay so far to be
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:19.200]  It's fine. If anything, I think I like it better. I was at Trader Joe's today and
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.200]  At some stores, you know at some stores
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.400]  It's like you can do the face ID or not the face ID that the Apple pay you can do it while they're still ringing
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:33.960]  You up, you know what? I mean? Like let's say you've bought 15 items and once they start scanning it
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:38.160]  You could just do your do your transaction and even if you're using a credit card
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.700]  You could like run the credit card in advance to get it ready and then you you know
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:49.920]  At Trader Joe's their their POS system seems like it only allows you to even do it once it is
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:56.240]  Final but I had since I was doing it while he was do I I double click the side button to put it into
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:58.240]  the mode and
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:01.560]  Then once he was done and beep it was the total
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.920]  It was already
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:07.640]  It was already recognized because I was like looking at the phone in front of the thing
[02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:12.920]  Like it's it. I don't know for some reason it seemed to me like an awful lot of the face ID skeptics
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.560]  Were anticipating that Apple pay in particular would be way less
[02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:21.720]  Ergonomic and I'm not finding that to be the case at all. Yeah, I was worried about that
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:24.280]  I haven't used it yet, but but I've heard the same thing from phone
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:26.280]  and the other thing too is that it
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:33.520]  Unifies the language with the design language with the watch where the watch you initiate the same way by double-clicking the side button to put
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:35.520]  It into the mode
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.460]  And I actually think that that's like a good bit of the old-fashioned Apple
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:46.120]  What's the word
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:48.120]  when like things are like
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:54.480]  Consistent alignment consider no consideration. Yeah consistency was the word that sort of went out the window and some of the years of Apple
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:01.120]  Well and and and is one of the more frustrations I think with their software like where different apps just have stuff in different places
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:02.760]  or
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:05.280]  Federico, did you put something on I'm sorry
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:10.760]  I forgot the name wrong on Twitter today where inconsistent capitalization in the App Store like I mean
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:13.720]  It's like stuff like that and that's sort of the frustration of being a big company
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:19.360]  Like you either like you either care about that or you don't and it's frustrating but that's the story examples
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:24.840]  That's the sort of thing that old old Apple like 90s era Apple never got wrong like yep there
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:28.320]  But on the other hand that was a much smaller surface area
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.160]  There were fewer things to to make sure we're title cased
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:39.540]  similarly one other thing I really like about about this transition to the iPhone 10 relative to the iPhone 6 in particular is I
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.520]  Really like how 10 handles old apps
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:48.040]  I maybe this is people like old apps look so bad on the iPhone 10. I actually think they're totally fine
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:52.680]  It just looks like a normal iPhone and the critical thing is that the keyboard position?
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.900]  With old apps is the exact same as the keyboard position with new apps and so people complain about this sort of like
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:03.480]  Why is the keyboard higher up? I think a big part of that is avoiding that bottom part
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:05.400]  So if you hit space you don't accidentally close the app
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:06.560]  I also
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:12.480]  Suspect they wanted to unify that because that was such a problem with the iPhone 6 transition because they had different keyboards in different apps
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.960]  And whereas here it's it's it's consistent
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:20.240]  And it's it's so much I think this transition for apps is a million times better than the ones they've done previously
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.280]  Yeah, it feels a little bit like wasted space
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:28.840]  But I feel like ergonomically it's right and I've happened to hear from some people who would know why the keyboard is done
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.000]  The way it is
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:37.640]  And it's exactly what you just said that that having some separation between the spacebar and the home indicator was actually important
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:43.720]  Usability wise and that testing proved it that people trying to get the home indicator were instead
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:48.320]  you know and swipe up or instead typing spaces and or vice versa and
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:52.640]  I think that I think you're exactly right that this transition with an app
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:58.220]  Unupdated apps is by far the easiest on the eyes. In fact, I sometimes don't even notice right away
[02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:02.520]  I'm almost like oh, whoa, I guess this one's not updated. It just sort of I
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:05.000]  you know
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:10.200]  By far like the jump with retina to rot non retina was it was horrendous like on
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:16.360]  Non retina apps on a retina iPhone 4 was immediate delete the app from my home screen didn't matter which app it was
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.360]  Yeah, I couldn't use it anymore
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:21.760]  The one but that reminds me. Oh, sorry
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:22.560]  I didn't interrupt you
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:27.780]  Well the one when they when they first made the screen bigger and the apps just ran in the middle right the screen and the
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.780]  Keyboard was an inch higher
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.260]  Well, not just that it was different the spacing between the keys was different
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.400]  It was it was really hard, but that reminds me
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:38.440]  I think another reason why the the apps that aren't running work
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:41.960]  So well is because old ads is like black is true black, right?
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:49.200]  Cuz it's right it's X it's not actually lit up the pixel unlike unlike LCDs the so two thoughts on that number one
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.280]  I I wouldn't be surprised and I hope iOS 12
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:58.520]  goes back to the original dark like it's a black interface and
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:04.000]  And apps that have dark mode like Twitter for example has a dark mode, but it's very dark blue
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:06.720]  It would if you have a dark mode in your app
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:13.020]  It should be black because it just looks so much better than than any other color in my estimation, but number two
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:21.920]  One more frustration. I know Apple has the best OLED screen in the industry the the the color shifts still bothers me like
[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.900]  It's apparent all the time
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:29.360]  I'm sure it's it's better than the pixel, but it's still there and all the apps that have dark mode
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.240]  I'm changing them just because I find I still find it distracting and if anything
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.160]  You can see it all the time. Even if you have the phone perfectly in front of your face
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:37.240]  I don't know what the math is
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:41.880]  But I'm gonna say it's like a 40 degree angle if you look at the app at anything at a 40 degree angle or more
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:45.560]  Everything on screen looks blue and the lighter it is the more pronounced it is
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:51.600]  So black doesn't change at all and white changes to a decidedly bluish tint and it right
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.240]  But even if you have it even if it tilted like 15 degrees
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:59.340]  The top of this the screen in the bottom of the screen have different hues like it's very very slight
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:05.080]  But it's definitely different and that's like the the full tilt. Okay, like that's it. That's okay with me
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:10.400]  It is a good point that minor tilt that is really that is definitely distracting. Yeah
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:15.640]  Yeah, the white at that if you could just go to an app like mail where it's mostly white it tilted a little
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:15.940]  Yeah
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:20.720]  You get white at the bottom and sort of a or white at the top and sort of blue at the bottom if you tilt
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:26.600]  It away from you. Yeah, I read OLED is not it's a great screen overall and I'm very happy and I don't regret that
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.840]  They went with it
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.640]  But it is not a clear win across the board from the LCDs and the iPhone 8
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.160]  Yep, I agree
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:39.760]  I I prefer I prefer the old ones even though I know all the benefits of OLED and I think what I think that's why
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:41.820]  I think they're gonna go with a much dark with like a black
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:46.840]  Interface in the future because I really like black looks incredible like it looks so good
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:51.040]  Well, it's sort of like the way on Apple watch. You can't really tell where the edge of the screen is. Yeah
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:51.360]  No, exactly
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.400]  I mean and so I have some apps that have a pure black mode and they just in they will
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.680]  Even the old ones that aren't updated
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.680]  They they almost look they don't look they totally fit in because the top and bottom you can barely tell the scenes at all
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:09.360]  So anyhow, but I think that's one of those things but this it gets back at the sort of delight thing
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:15.080]  Just to take a full circle like all that all these little errors. It's okay. I feel confident
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:16.840]  they're gonna be fixed because
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:23.600]  I'm still so I'm enjoying using this so much. It's it is. All right, Ben. Thank you for so much for your time
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.720]  Everybody can check out your work at Stratechery
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:31.280]  calm and
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.960]  There's a weekly daily newsletter
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:41.200]  You can sign up for which is one of my favorite reads every single day and then on Twitter you are at Ben Thompson
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:48.640]  And also at no tech Ben if you enjoyed the opening minutes of basketball talk
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.680]  The problem is I made no tech Ben because I like to be very vociferous on Twitter
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:57.200]  So so I want to be able to tweet like during a game and like be super annoying about it
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:01.160]  The problem is so like some people like follow me like man, you don't shut up. Do you I'm like
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:04.600]  That's why I made a separate account. You can't complain about my making a separate account
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.560]  I like if you want to complain about main account, I get it
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.520]  That's why I made a separate one but for good lord, like I'm already doing you a favor here
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:37.760]  Yeah, I should register jackass John
