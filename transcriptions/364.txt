[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  don't have World Cup fever. I'll just say that. I'd like to, you know, I wish I had World Cup
[00:04.800 --> 00:09.600]  fever, I guess. I don't know. I got so soured on professional sports because of baseball.
[00:10.880 --> 00:14.800]  This is what happens when your team is not so great.
[00:15.600 --> 00:17.680]  Yeah, but the Mariners have gotten good.
[00:17.680 --> 00:20.800]  Yeah, they've gotten better. They've gotten better for sure. But it's been a while, though.
[00:21.600 --> 00:27.840]  It only took 20 years to get back to the playoffs. That's not exactly something that draws your
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.800]  constant attention.
[00:28.800 --> 00:33.040]  You know, it's funny, when we were growing up, when you and I were growing up, the two big
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.560]  losers were the Cubs and the Red Sox, right? The teams that, you know, hadn't won
[00:39.840 --> 00:46.880]  since, like, before World War I, the Great War. And they've both since gone on in recent years
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.960]  and decades to win World Series, so they've ended it. But it is funny, though. It's like,
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.840]  you grow up and it's just in the air. It's just, you know, oh, the Cubs. Well, they never,
[00:55.840 --> 00:59.760]  you know, Cubs and Red Sox, oh, they never win, you know. They'll break your heart if
[00:59.760 --> 01:03.360]  you're the fan. They'll get close. Once every 10 years, they'll get close, and then they'll,
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.960]  you know, some weird, weird will happen.
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.120]  Yeah, some guy will touch a ball in the outfield.
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.040]  And I just accepted it, you know, that, oh, well, you know, those, you know, especially
[01:13.040 --> 01:17.040]  Red Sox fans, they just love, you know, they love to lose. They're like pigs in mud. They
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.920]  just wallow in it, and that's, they just, you know, that's what they want. But then you get
[01:21.920 --> 01:24.800]  older, you hit middle age, and you realize, you know.
[01:24.800 --> 01:25.840]  Yeah.
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.320]  You don't get many 20-year stretches in life, you know, I mean.
[01:30.320 --> 01:30.960]  Right.
[01:30.960 --> 01:32.160]  You run out of them.
[01:32.160 --> 01:35.600]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, that must have been like, you know, I mean,
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.720]  think about how many people grew up and died with those teams being just really not great at all.
[01:42.720 --> 01:43.220]  I know.
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.480]  I, that's, that's so, that's so thankless. Yeah, and I, so I just didn't, you know,
[01:48.480 --> 01:51.360]  and I didn't want to be, I stopped paying attention to, because I did, like,
[01:51.360 --> 01:56.160]  I didn't want to be that person, right? I didn't want to be sitting there year after year, and I
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.520]  love the game. That's the thing. I love the game, but it's just like, you know, and you've got
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.400]  management that really just doesn't seem to give a crap.
[02:03.280 --> 02:09.280]  I do know, I know several baseball fans. I know them who, no, but who really love the game,
[02:09.280 --> 02:15.840]  and baseball is an interesting sport to me, because you can really love the game and go to
[02:15.840 --> 02:21.520]  see minor league baseball, and, you know, you pay like seven bucks, you get a great seat. The
[02:21.520 --> 02:28.960]  hot dogs and sodas and beer don't cost, you know, $15. And you get to watch a really, you know,
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.680]  if you just like sitting in a ballpark watching a game, you can pay a lot less money, get a much
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.640]  better seat, and you get a really high quality product. Yeah, particularly now. I mean, we
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.680]  started going to the Rainier's game. We have a great fun anyway, and they actually play pretty
[02:43.680 --> 02:50.480]  well. I think they've won the PCL a number of times and the Rainier's here in town in Tacoma.
[02:51.120 --> 02:53.760]  And we used to take Hank all the time when he was a kid, cause they, they would let,
[02:53.760 --> 02:56.640]  they lean on in the middle, you know, they do all these wacky promotions, you know,
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.240]  they like roll these big dice down the netting and into the field. And then they,
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.160]  in the seventh inning stretch, they let the kids out on the field to run the bases with the mascot.
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.160]  Oh, that's wild. Yeah. So he and I went, you know, we go out on the field and run around the bases.
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.120]  Yeah. So yeah, so this is super fun. Oh, and then in one year we, you know, you can afford to get
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.120]  box seats. You know what I mean? Like, it'll be a little bit expensive, but you can sit right next
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.880]  to the, you know, right on the, we sat on the right on the third baseline one time.
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.840]  And the, you know, I just, as a joke, the visiting, one of the visiting pitchers dugout
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.480]  was right there. Cause it was, you know, or, you know, not the dugout, a bullpen. And
[03:30.480 --> 03:38.080]  the, one of the, the visiting pitchers leaned over and pretended he was grabbing my beer.
[03:38.080 --> 03:41.600]  Like, you know, we're, we're like that close cause I'm sitting there and I'm talking to my,
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.440]  I'm talking to Karen and my friends and we're, and, you know, Karen goes, Hey,
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.120]  Hey, Hey, she's like looking over my shoulder. Hey, Hey, Hey. And I turn and look and this guy's
[03:49.120 --> 04:00.560]  reaching for my beer. It's like, get out of here. Oh, that's funny. There's it's funny because I'm
[04:00.560 --> 04:04.240]  looking for stuff to laugh at because I'm looking at everything on my list here of things to talk
[04:04.240 --> 04:08.640]  about. One more thing. I wanted to plug this because I, I just came up. I forget. I forget.
[04:08.640 --> 04:16.160]  It's not me. It's this, have you seen sleep baseball.com? No, it's a podcast. That is
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.080]  fake baseball announcements, you know, to, to fall asleep to. So it's a game and they do it as if
[04:22.080 --> 04:26.160]  it's a, you know, like it's a real game, but it's not real teams or anything. And the players are
[04:26.160 --> 04:32.000]  all made up. And it's just guy, this guy who speaks like this. Well, here comes Johnson
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.680]  and he takes one loan inside and it's just, you listen for like two and a half, you know,
[04:37.680 --> 04:40.720]  it's a game that's like two and a half, three hours, something like that. And it's just to
[04:40.720 --> 04:46.480]  fall asleep to. And it's great. It's so good. And they have, they have, you know, they have crazy ads.
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.600]  Like, you know, one of the players will say, hi, this is Brett McConskey. And when I was young,
[04:53.600 --> 04:59.920]  we used to do all kinds of crazy things like stand on our heads. But now some of my friends
[04:59.920 --> 05:05.840]  have gotten in trouble with drugs. This, this has been Brett McConskey. And that's like the whole
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.960]  thing. That's the whole ad bit, the whole interlude. And then they go back to the game.
[05:10.960 --> 05:17.840]  Anyway. Oh, man. It's fun. I always thought golf, the golf announcement, you know, just,
[05:17.840 --> 05:23.600]  just take out the commercials and just regular golf announcement. Yeah. Just have Jim Nance.
[05:23.600 --> 05:27.440]  Well, they're, they're whispering anyway. Yeah. That's, that's why it's so great. I think that
[05:27.440 --> 05:33.440]  I think it could help. I think even a golf fan could, you know, fall asleep to listen into golf.
[05:33.440 --> 05:43.120]  Just get some guy with a Scottish accent. Oh man. Lots going on. Why don't I just start,
[05:43.120 --> 05:48.640]  I'll start. I'm going to start by taking a break. I love this. This is, this is sponsored. They
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.120]  sponsored the website a couple of weeks ago, and I really, I've fallen in love with this app.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.520]  It's called Sofa. S O F A. Just spell it the regular way. All right. What do you do when
[05:59.520 --> 06:05.280]  you hear about a great new TV show, a movie, a book, or even a podcast? We just talked about
[06:05.280 --> 06:11.120]  a podcast. What do you do? You probably scribble it down in your notes or to do app and you might
[06:11.120 --> 06:18.560]  forget about it instead. Throw it in sofa. Sofa is a dedicated app that lets you create lists
[06:18.560 --> 06:25.040]  of almost anything, but it's meant for stuff like podcasts, apps, books, board games, even movies,
[06:25.040 --> 06:31.520]  TV shows, music albums. You can then use these lists to decide your next book to read movie,
[06:31.520 --> 06:37.360]  to watch or video game to play. The design is inspired by some of today's best productivity
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.560]  apps, but focused on helping you to be more intentional with your downtime. You think about
[06:42.560 --> 06:48.080]  it, the tools we use for managing our downtime are designed for work. This includes like to do
[06:48.080 --> 06:53.360]  apps and notes, apps, calendar apps. These are all designed for work. Sofa is deliberately designed
[06:53.360 --> 06:59.840]  for, guess what? When you're on the sofa. It's actually a great name. It's a really, really
[06:59.840 --> 07:04.480]  cleverly designed app and it does because it's meant, you can make lists of anything literally,
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.280]  but because it knows that you might want to enter stuff like TV shows and movies and books,
[07:09.280 --> 07:14.800]  when you go to enter a movie or TV show or book, it can auto complete the list from like internet
[07:14.800 --> 07:20.000]  movie database source or something like that, where it knows what's the name of a movie,
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.640]  what's the name of a TV show, stuff like that. The majority of sofa is completely free to use.
[07:26.640 --> 07:30.480]  So you could just interrupt the podcast right now, go to the app store, search for sofa and
[07:32.320 --> 07:38.400]  start using it for free. You can create unlimited lists, sync your data with iCloud,
[07:38.400 --> 07:43.680]  which means it syncs across devices and it's completely private, track your activity and more.
[07:43.680 --> 07:48.800]  If you're looking for a little more power, you can upgrade to super sofa with super sofa.
[07:48.800 --> 07:52.720]  You get the ability to customize lists with cover images and descriptions.
[07:52.720 --> 07:57.520]  You can add sticky notes to your items, personalize the look and feel with over
[07:57.520 --> 08:04.160]  100 different themes. And trust me, I went down this rabbit hole when they sponsored my site,
[08:04.160 --> 08:10.640]  there went an afternoon and a whole lot more. It is available for the iPhone,
[08:10.640 --> 08:16.560]  iPad and Apple Silicon Macs. If you want to start organizing your downtime, head over to
[08:16.560 --> 08:27.600]  sofa HQ, S-O-F-A-H-Q, sofa HQ.com slash the talk show, sofa HQ.com slash the talk show.
[08:27.600 --> 08:34.000]  Download it today. I thank sofa for supporting the talk show. And seriously, I'm telling you this,
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.080]  it is absolutely, sincerely a great native app that you should check out if you're
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.600]  actually enjoy entertaining yourself with stuff like TV and movies. I swear, go check it out.
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.520]  I would recommend this app even if they weren't sponsoring the show. It's that good. Go get it.
[08:49.520 --> 08:57.760]  Sofa HQ.com slash the talk show. In the news this week. Oh my God, it's usually there's no
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.560]  news around Thanksgiving. And thanks to our good friend, our very good friend of the show,
[09:02.560 --> 09:10.960]  friend of the show, Mr. Elon Musk, avid listener,
[09:13.040 --> 09:20.560]  a topic that has already been in my sights. Cause I am a long time Twitter user. I don't know if,
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.400]  if you recall that. And I enjoy Twitter and I'm very interested in Twitter. So I've been
[09:26.400 --> 09:33.120]  following it and as more or less, he has more or less single-handedly steered the entire
[09:33.120 --> 09:36.000]  Twitter saga directly into the John Gruber wheelhouse.
[09:37.520 --> 09:43.280]  Yeah, it's weird that it's taken this turn at this point, right? That it first, first,
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.400]  it was just some guy coming in, you know, what's he going to do? And then it's, Oh,
[09:46.400 --> 09:53.200]  this guy is ruining this thing that I've loved for 15 years. And now it's like, Oh, now he's like
[09:53.200 --> 09:57.600]  driving straight into the Apple's lane, come in the opposite direction.
[09:57.600 --> 10:04.480]  I did predict this. My predictions on this are clearly across the map in terms of how,
[10:05.120 --> 10:10.240]  how good these bets look given my infamous, I'm more optimistic than ever about Twitter.
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.760]  Which, you know, it's our good friend cable Sasser, you know,
[10:15.760 --> 10:19.200]  admitted when he was making fun of me and threatening to make t-shirts with the quote
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.800]  that my very next sentence was, but of course it's also very likely might something to the
[10:24.800 --> 10:30.880]  effect of that. He might just steer Twitter right into a ditch, but right. I did predict though.
[10:30.880 --> 10:38.000]  I predicted last week though, that the app store is going to be a problem for him with the way
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.480]  he's going for sure. And in two ways, and of course, like I will give him credit. At least
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.920]  he doesn't waste time. You know, that's true. I really actually mean this. I would have thought
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.120]  it would have taken a lot longer, but we're here already. I, you know, and, and a man who has gone
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.320]  from co-founding PayPal, which I get, all right, let's, let's, let's say that's a long time ago.
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.920]  Cause that's like the nineties, but has since made the premier electric car company in the world,
[11:07.920 --> 11:11.920]  or, you know, I know he didn't found that company, which I think is actually important.
[11:11.920 --> 11:17.520]  He has a rocket company that actually has real rockets that do amazing things that no other
[11:17.520 --> 11:26.480]  rockets can do. Now he's supposedly started a tunnel company called the boring company, which
[11:26.480 --> 11:29.840]  the, the wall street journal. I don't know. Did you see that story yesterday where they,
[11:29.840 --> 11:37.600]  they sort of had a, Hey, they're not really doing anything except, except getting municipalities
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.760]  around North America to stop planned high-speed rail. Yeah. They're like, no, no, no. I wonder
[11:43.760 --> 11:47.840]  why they want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Guy who owns a car company wants them to stop. Oh,
[11:50.560 --> 11:59.600]  exactly. And I, I do think it's unfortunate. I think it's just a, I think that I think most
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.000]  people who work in local municipal government are very, they're doing it for the right reasons
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.160]  for the most part. I don't think that these are overly political hacks on either side of the
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.760]  spectrum. They're just trying to get stuff done, but I think they're in over their heads on tech,
[12:13.760 --> 12:18.320]  on technology. And I don't, I'm reading that wall street journal story about how
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.200]  the boring company convinced various municipalities to stop these high speed rail
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.920]  programs. It really seems like they're like, wow, this must be real because it's, you know,
[12:27.920 --> 12:33.760]  Elon Musk, you know, yeah, here's this highly successful person. And it's not based on any
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.760]  sort of expertise at the viability of the actual tunneling projects they said they would build and
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.880]  the costs, you know, so like the one they had was Ontario, California, which I've never heard of.
[12:44.880 --> 12:52.240]  It's apparently in the San Bernardino area, but it's an airport that was long been used for freight,
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.600]  very busy, but it's starting to grow significantly in commuter traffic, you know, personal air travel
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.960]  and they wanted to build, they have a rail station for public transit, but it's four miles away from
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.840]  the airport. And they thought, well, this so far makes total sense. We could get more people to go
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.280]  to this airport if we connect that rail station with the airport, with public transportation.
[13:15.840 --> 13:22.800]  Sounds good to me. And it was doing it as high speed rail might cost a billion to 1.5 billion.
[13:23.440 --> 13:27.600]  Significant expenditure, I think, for any municipality and, you know, especially one
[13:27.600 --> 13:32.400]  that's not a super mega city. And then the Boring Company came in and said, we can build a tunnel
[13:32.400 --> 13:42.960]  for $50 million. So I look at that and I don't know, I am not a civil engineer. I had roommates
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.600]  in college who were civil engineers. That's about as close to civil engineering expertise
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.400]  as I've gotten. I read Dr. Drang's site. I'm not an expert. But you tell me that a project that was
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.800]  that the traditional way is one to 1.5 billion. And then the new way is 50 million.
[14:02.240 --> 14:08.640]  I immediately think, where's my wallet? Yeah, I'm putting my hand on my pocket.
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.560]  Well, and the problem it creates, of course, is that, you know, he's telling everybody
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.160]  these things. Right. And so when he says something like that in public, a lot of people will just say,
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.360]  well, why are we building this thing? That's, you know, even if it doesn't make any sense,
[14:21.360 --> 14:25.360]  even if it doesn't make any sense, people are saying, why would we build this thing
[14:25.360 --> 14:28.640]  that's billion dollars when Musk says we can build this thing for 50 million?
[14:29.200 --> 14:36.560]  Exactly. So you have no political cover. Right. Other than, you know, I guess
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.880]  going against Elon Musk and I get it. It's tough because then all of a sudden what happens if he
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.080]  starts making fun of you on Twitter, you know, even before he owned the place. No, you know what
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.920]  I mean? Like that. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you have, I mean, he has a,
[14:51.920 --> 14:58.880]  he has a very loyal fan base and reminds me of somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Really. I saw,
[14:58.880 --> 15:02.960]  I don't want, I don't want to name any names. I don't want to give these people
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.280]  any more popularity. But there was, you know, the whole thing with Tim Cook came up the other day
[15:09.280 --> 15:18.160]  and somebody added at Musk, I was just having to look at a thread and it was a picture of Tim Cook.
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.120]  And the point of the, the point of the image or the some sort of meme point of the image was
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.080]  why not? Why not? Hey, Elon, why don't you just buy Apple and fire Tim Cook?
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.280]  That's like, yeah, that's not how math works.
[15:33.280 --> 15:39.440]  Well, usually he's, he is very wealthy, but he cannot buy Apple. No, there were, I remember
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.720]  years ago, several, I don't know who knows these days, how many years, but you know, there were
[15:44.720 --> 15:52.800]  people, I, I guess this is one of those things, circa 2013, right? 2013 was sort of the bad year
[15:52.800 --> 16:01.520]  for Apple, where that was the, the height of the Apple can't innovate, right? Like,
[16:01.520 --> 16:07.360]  of the Apple can't innovate anymore. Samsung phones are bigger and that's what people want.
[16:08.320 --> 16:14.800]  And Apple clearly, you know, it was, it's a disaster to name the operations guy, the new CEO
[16:14.800 --> 16:18.320]  there, you know, every, you know, we were right to Apple can't, you know, here we are two years
[16:18.320 --> 16:23.920]  after Steve Jobs died that they need somebody like that. So Apple should buy Tesla and then name
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.520]  Elon Musk, the CEO. Right. That was, I mean, you could, I don't have to even Google it. There's
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.320]  dozens and dozens of hot takes like that. And I would say they were all, I'll bet the date on all
[16:34.320 --> 16:41.280]  of them is 2013. Because what, you know, clearly what you all, you know, the only thing any company
[16:41.280 --> 16:47.680]  needs is a hot head. That's it. That's the thing that made Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs is that he,
[16:47.680 --> 16:51.760]  he was a hot head. I mean, there was a huge misconception about,
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.760]  Musk though, that he was, you know, big product guy and came up with all these ideas when he
[16:57.760 --> 17:04.720]  really did not. I don't have a link to it handy, but somebody, I don't know if it was on Medium
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.640]  or what. I should look it up and try to get it in the show notes. I actually should try to link to
[17:08.640 --> 17:14.480]  it from Daring Fireball. But the gist of it was that the question that I think is on a lot of
[17:14.480 --> 17:21.600]  people's minds right now is, wait, watching this man manage Twitter in public. And, you know,
[17:21.600 --> 17:25.920]  one thing we could say about him is his management style so far has not been in secret.
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.960]  Watching him manage Twitter, how in the world does he have, does he run two successful companies,
[17:30.960 --> 17:36.080]  Tesla and SpaceX? And somebody answered, somebody who worked at one of the companies,
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.960]  I think it was on Medium, answered and said more or less that, that these companies, A,
[17:40.960 --> 17:46.400]  they existed before he came in and sort of had a thing in place. And, you know, he didn't found
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.920]  either, he bought them and took over, but that they've both evolved company cultures and
[17:53.920 --> 18:03.280]  structures that sort of isolate. It's like shock absorbers in a car, right? That it's, okay,
[18:03.280 --> 18:03.840]  we know—
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.440]  work around his eccentricities.
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.080]  And impetuousness. And so there are people, you know, he can come in and say X, Y, Z,
[18:12.080 --> 18:16.400]  and they know that he might just randomly come in and demand X, Y, Z, which don't make any sense.
[18:16.400 --> 18:22.240]  And they have a system in place to more or less placate him. And then meanwhile, they're
[18:22.240 --> 18:28.720]  continuing to actually do things like land, you know, launch satellites into space, and then
[18:28.720 --> 18:36.160]  land the rocket back on a launch pad in the ocean, and continuing to make cars that are very popular
[18:36.160 --> 18:42.480]  and continue to sell in ever-increasing numbers. So he's like, yeah, I'm doing a great job. But
[18:42.480 --> 18:44.960]  they've more or less got systems in place to keep him—
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.920]  The companies, the companies are continuing to be successful despite him rather than because—
[18:49.920 --> 18:54.960]  And that they've set up a hierarchy of management that is meant for that,
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.160]  whereas he came into Twitter and there is no buffer.
[18:59.760 --> 19:08.400]  There are no competent, actually competent executives surrounding him who are insulating
[19:08.400 --> 19:12.800]  the company from his impetuousness. This is his management style. And then I sort of think,
[19:12.800 --> 19:17.600]  going back to my comment on the Boring company, that's another one that he seemingly launched
[19:17.600 --> 19:22.720]  on a whim. And it is a real company with a huge amount of funding from reputable VC firms, you
[19:22.720 --> 19:28.880]  know, and the CEO, I forget his name, but he was hired away from SpaceX. I guess I don't even know
[19:28.880 --> 19:36.640]  if you call that hired away when the same guy transferred over from Elon's SpaceX division to
[19:36.640 --> 19:42.240]  the Boring company. And I hope they work. Again, it's another weird thing about Elon Musk is,
[19:42.240 --> 19:49.360]  even as I grow to dislike him more personally, I do root for his ventures, right? If this hyperloop
[19:49.360 --> 19:55.040]  thing ever came to be and you could go up and down the East Coast from New York to Washington
[19:55.040 --> 20:01.440]  at 700 miles an hour underground or the similar—I know everybody wants the one between LA and San
[20:01.440 --> 20:07.920]  Francisco—that would be fabulous, right? Who would root against that, right? It's right out of—
[20:07.920 --> 20:13.520]  That's the one, though, that seems based on everything that I've seen is more smoke and
[20:13.520 --> 20:20.320]  mirrors, right? I mean, I think the Wall Street Journal piece points that out. Whereas the other
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.920]  two are actual things that are actually—whereas this one is like, no, we're going to make a bunch
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.800]  of noise about this just to stop high-speed rail. So that seems like that's more the purpose of that
[20:32.800 --> 20:40.560]  company as opposed to actually making the thing. Yeah, it seems like it. So we're starting to form
[20:40.560 --> 20:46.240]  at least a hypothesis, right? Let's not say it's proven, but there's a hypothesis for how
[20:46.240 --> 20:52.720]  two of these companies are thriving and actually innovative. And these others, it's more or less,
[20:52.720 --> 20:58.240]  is he actually running the company, is the hypothesis. And if the answer is yes,
[20:58.240 --> 21:07.520]  it may not be a good result. But I did predict this Twitter-Apple drama. And I don't think I
[21:07.520 --> 21:13.120]  deserve even one of my famous being right points because I think on both fronts, it was so
[21:13.120 --> 21:23.840]  incredibly obvious, especially the App Store Commission front, the 30-70 split Apple takes
[21:23.840 --> 21:29.680]  for the first year of any subscription and 85-15 afterwards. Clearly, the small business—well,
[21:30.560 --> 21:37.280]  who knows? Maybe he'll eventually get Twitter down to the under 1 million a year small business
[21:40.080 --> 21:47.280]  threshold. He's working on it. So he might be able to go 85-15 right from the start if he keeps going
[21:47.280 --> 21:58.640]  with Twitter the way he's going. That was clearly going to be a conflict because by all reports,
[21:58.640 --> 22:05.600]  many of his plans for adding additional stools to Twitter's revenue, which is primarily advertising
[22:05.600 --> 22:10.880]  right now, involves subscriptions. And subscriptions mean selling stuff to your users.
[22:10.880 --> 22:18.640]  And if your users mostly use mobile apps, which is true for Twitter, that means you're going to have
[22:18.640 --> 22:24.960]  to pay the app stores, Apple and Google. And you just knew that wasn't going to sit well with them.
[22:24.960 --> 22:32.880]  And then on the other front is the content moderation loosening at Twitter or whatever
[22:32.880 --> 22:40.160]  you want to call what he's doing by letting previously banned people back on today as we
[22:40.160 --> 22:47.840]  record. They officially rescinded their COVID misinformation rules, which that's one where
[22:48.720 --> 22:56.960]  I actually feel that the COVID rules—I personally feel that Twitter and maybe even Facebook misplayed
[22:56.960 --> 23:05.920]  that. I think the rules they had in hindsight, I think they were well-meaning. And I do think
[23:05.920 --> 23:12.400]  that they actually used actual scientific consensus to guide them. But there's two
[23:12.400 --> 23:17.440]  problems with that. I think that even if the scientific consensus throughout the whole COVID
[23:18.160 --> 23:26.480]  drama, 2020 and 2021, had been accurate or almost completely accurate, I still feel
[23:26.480 --> 23:34.800]  that a complete ban on the other stuff only feeds into the exact sort of thinking that leads people
[23:34.800 --> 23:41.520]  to the conspiracy theories. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, so what's the difference between
[23:41.520 --> 23:46.560]  that and political? I mean, why do you think that's different from saying that the election
[23:46.560 --> 23:54.080]  was stolen? I'm not sure it should be. I don't know that it should be against Twitter's rules
[23:54.080 --> 24:00.480]  to tweet, I think the election is stolen. I don't think it should be. I think hate speech
[24:00.480 --> 24:07.680]  clearly needs to be banned, something that threatens people personally. And I think outright
[24:07.680 --> 24:16.640]  racism, racial slurs. I mean, all of this stuff is famously—and everybody's written
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.200]  about it since he took over Twitter. I mean, Nilay Patel had a great piece. But content
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.200]  moderation is the product, ultimately, right? It's the tweets. It's not really a software product.
[24:27.200 --> 24:32.800]  It's the actual tweets you see on Twitter are the product. And whether you see them on their
[24:32.800 --> 24:37.440]  website or in an app or in a third-party app like Twitterrific or Tweetbot, the product is
[24:37.440 --> 24:44.800]  the tweets. And therefore, the content moderation is the actual product they make. So I'm—I don't
[24:44.800 --> 24:49.200]  know. I don't think it worked out well. The other problem with the COVID stuff is that the
[24:49.200 --> 24:56.000]  scientific consensus was largely wrong throughout it, right? There was the, infamously, the
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.120]  don't-wear-masks, don't-wear-masks, save them for our front-line responders. Masks don't matter.
[25:01.760 --> 25:05.680]  You know, wash your hands and scrub all your groceries as they come in the door.
[25:05.680 --> 25:07.200]  Hey, you laugh. I mean, we all did it.
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.360]  No, I know. I remember watching that video, that doctor scrubbing all of the groceries
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.600]  and looking at that and thinking, oh my god.
[25:13.600 --> 25:15.600]  Oh shit, I'm just giving him a rinse.
[25:16.080 --> 25:23.360]  Yeah, right, right. Like, is this going to be my life for the next, you know, however long?
[25:23.360 --> 25:29.520]  We were rinsing. We were rinsing everything, but we were like, oh shit, we're not doing that. Oh.
[25:30.160 --> 25:30.640]  Yeah.
[25:30.640 --> 25:32.400]  You know, it was a lot—
[25:32.400 --> 25:33.520]  Bleach my oranges.
[25:34.080 --> 25:36.560]  There was a lot of stuff that turned out to be wrong.
[25:36.560 --> 25:38.160]  Yeah, that's true.
[25:38.160 --> 25:43.840]  And I don't know that people tweeting—I just don't think that the rules did much. I don't
[25:43.840 --> 25:54.960]  know that they helped. And I think it's all—there's two sides to it. At the low end, Joe random
[25:56.160 --> 26:02.800]  Twitter user tweeting, I don't trust this vaccine. I don't trust any vaccine that was developed in
[26:02.800 --> 26:09.200]  only 12 months or something like that. You know, obviously a lot of the anti-vaccine stuff was
[26:09.200 --> 26:19.040]  even worse. I don't know that that was the problem as much as the fact that the main Twitter timeline
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.080]  is algorithmically generated.
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.200]  I think it's both, right? Because if you have less of that misinformation,
[26:27.200 --> 26:31.440]  the algorithm is going to promote it less. And the other thing that I think that happens is that
[26:31.440 --> 26:38.400]  people who are bad actors tend to go after that stuff and try to promote it further, and then the
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.480]  algorithm recognizes that as something like, oh, people are talking about this. I'm going to keep
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.960]  displaying this. And so, you know, it's a snowball effect.
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.240]  So I'm not pretending like I have an answer. Maybe Twitter played it perfectly. I'm actually
[26:52.240 --> 26:59.040]  amenable to the fact that maybe Twitter's COVID policy was, like talking about democracy and
[26:59.040 --> 27:05.440]  capitalism, the worst system ever, except for all the other ones. Well, yeah, I think that's true.
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.520]  I mean, at least these were people who were legitimately trying to solve the problem,
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.040]  as opposed to people who were trying to exploit it for political purposes.
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.640]  Right. But regardless, you know, we know that he's loosening up the rules, their rules for
[27:18.640 --> 27:27.280]  content moderation, and fewer topics are banned, and more people who were banned are coming back.
[27:27.280 --> 27:36.720]  And in my opinion, none for the better. But it's going to run into Apple probably more so than
[27:36.720 --> 27:49.520]  Google, but both of them have content moderation rules surrounding the apps. And it all opens up
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.720]  the entire gigantic, I was going to say can of worms, but it's more like one of those,
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.040]  uh, like those water towers, right? It's like a giant water tower full of worms
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.960]  that's supposed to, you know, giant 10 million dollars.
[28:04.960 --> 28:07.280]  Why do they store the worms in there? Nobody knows.
[28:07.280 --> 28:13.920]  Nobody knows of Apple and Google's influence over everything we see because of their control over
[28:13.920 --> 28:22.960]  their respective app stores. But Parler is a good example. Parler, P-A-R-L-E-R. If you've never
[28:22.960 --> 28:28.480]  heard of it, you're lucky. Parler. I mean, that name just cracks me up every single time because
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.640]  when I first saw it, I didn't hear the, you know, I don't listen to TV news, so I didn't hear
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.440]  anybody say it. And I, you know, my first thing was, you know, because I did years of French was
[28:37.440 --> 28:43.760]  this Parler. And then, and then like, not like five minutes later, it hit me like who the people
[28:43.760 --> 28:50.960]  who made this site were, and then I suddenly knew, no, it's not, it's Parler. They just found a way
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.160]  to spell it that was original. But I do think there was a thing, I think they actually did have
[28:56.160 --> 29:00.240]  a thing going on, though, where the site was Parler, even though in French it would be
[29:00.240 --> 29:05.680]  pronounced Parlay, but they were calling their posts Parlays, I think. And then I think they
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.240]  gave up on it because they're like, this is just confusing people. Because they were spelling it
[29:10.240 --> 29:16.960]  in the English way, P-A-R-L-A-Y, you know, for the posts. We'll get back to this when we talk about
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.680]  Mastodon later. But you got to, you know, rule one of these things is you got to have a cutesy
[29:21.680 --> 29:32.080]  name for your posts. But with Parler, Apple, I guess I was after January 6, 2020, or no,
[29:32.640 --> 29:42.400]  2021, where 2020 was the pandemic year. That's right, John. That's right. 2021 was the, the
[29:42.400 --> 29:46.240]  sitting president of the United States led an insurrection against the federal government.
[29:46.240 --> 29:52.800]  That's that was that was 2021. I'm getting my seasons mixed up. No, but Apple removed
[29:52.800 --> 29:57.360]  Parler from the App Store early in the year. I think they were off. I looked it up the other
[29:57.360 --> 30:03.040]  day. It was like three months, but for content for lack of content moderation, and that people
[30:03.040 --> 30:08.960]  were posting things that Apple thought were over the line, and that the company did not have any
[30:08.960 --> 30:16.880]  sort of infrastructure to moderate it. And therefore, it was removed. Google did too.
[30:16.880 --> 30:22.720]  And I actually think, even though I was just saying that Apple might be more stringent than
[30:22.720 --> 30:27.920]  Google, I believe, I don't even know Google get it first, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And I
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.560]  think they were off longer. I'm not even sure if they're back. No, it looks like it's back. But
[30:32.560 --> 30:39.520]  yeah, Google Parler returns to the Google Play Store. That was September. Yeah. So Google kept
[30:39.520 --> 30:45.520]  Parler off their store longer than Apple did. So maybe not. But Parler is the perfect example,
[30:45.520 --> 30:52.000]  though, where it was it leaned, for lack of a better word, leaned right, in terms of who was
[30:52.000 --> 30:58.160]  attracted to the platform. Because people on the right in the US, at least, I think worldwide,
[30:58.160 --> 31:03.520]  I think worldwide, but especially in the US, politically are obsessed, absolutely
[31:05.840 --> 31:12.080]  obsessed with the idea that Twitter, Twitter's users, the blue check people,
[31:12.800 --> 31:18.160]  the people inside the company, the people running the content moderation, the previous leadership
[31:18.160 --> 31:23.600]  of the company, from top to bottom, all the way down to the users were all Democratic operatives
[31:23.600 --> 31:31.360]  and out to sabotage Republicans and conservatives in the US in any way possible.
[31:32.080 --> 31:37.120]  As opposed to the Occam's razor, you know, what's the simplest explanation? No, it's
[31:40.720 --> 31:47.440]  you who sucks. Yeah. I saw, you know, people like this, there's some kind of thing where you when
[31:47.440 --> 31:52.240]  you give to political as an individual, not a company, but as an individual, and you contribute
[31:52.240 --> 31:58.400]  to politicians and political campaigns, I don't know if you have to say your employer, I think
[31:58.400 --> 32:03.120]  you do. Maybe, maybe that's part of it. I don't know. I think, yeah, my wife does all the political
[32:03.120 --> 32:09.600]  giving in our household. So God only knows what she fills in there. But but, you know,
[32:09.600 --> 32:15.840]  then there's records of this and all of these Silicon Valley companies overwhelmingly employee
[32:15.840 --> 32:22.240]  donations it well into the high 90 percentile give to Democrats instead of Republicans. And I think
[32:22.240 --> 32:28.320]  the again, the Occam's razor explanation is that people honestly, I know that, you know, it's true,
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.440]  people who live on the coasts tend to be more liberal. I mean, California is a blue state.
[32:33.440 --> 32:39.280]  That's where these companies are located. People with higher level degrees of education tend to be
[32:39.280 --> 32:45.360]  liberal. And people who are smarter tend to vote Democratic. And these companies are full of smart
[32:45.360 --> 32:49.920]  people. And I'm not, you know, this is not any kind of blanket statement that people who vote
[32:49.920 --> 32:55.040]  for Republicans are dumb and people who vote for Democrats are smart. It's just, I don't think it's
[32:55.040 --> 33:01.280]  surprising demographically at all that 90 plus percent of individual donations from companies
[33:01.280 --> 33:07.040]  like Apple and Google and Twitter went to Democrats in it. It's not a conspiracy. And I
[33:07.040 --> 33:15.520]  honestly think that Twitter let conservatives post anything short of hate, you know, and, and,
[33:15.520 --> 33:20.320]  you know, insurrection, you know, these are things that seem like they should be banned and aren't
[33:20.320 --> 33:28.160]  really against against your general political leanings. I but anyway, so parlor drew. So what
[33:28.160 --> 33:33.760]  happened, though, is where I'm going with parlor is that these alternative, Twitter like services,
[33:33.760 --> 33:38.160]  private services, there's parlor was the one that got a lot of headlines because they got kicked
[33:38.160 --> 33:44.560]  off. There was one called gab, that I think was even worse. And it was actually run by an outright
[33:44.560 --> 33:51.360]  white nationalist neo Nazi. And I happen to know this because he got involved. Percy was like a top
[33:51.360 --> 34:00.960]  advisor to Doug Mastriano, who was the right wing Nazi sympathizer, who was the republic was last
[34:00.960 --> 34:07.680]  month, the republican nominee for governor here in Pennsylvania and lost, thankfully, in a 20 as
[34:07.680 --> 34:13.600]  he is still not conceded, he is still not conceded, he's never going to concede. And I love the guy
[34:13.600 --> 34:20.240]  who won. Shapiro, Shapiro, his response. They're like, hey, what do you still hasn't called to
[34:20.240 --> 34:26.640]  concede? And I love his response. Who cares? Who cares? Just don't give him oxygen. It is it
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.280]  honestly, it's like it's it's like parenting advice. It's like when your kid is throwing a
[34:31.280 --> 34:38.080]  tantrum, don't pay attention to them. Right? It's the number one way to stop a tantrum with a small
[34:38.080 --> 34:43.440]  child is don't pay attention. That's what they want is the attention. So don't drop everything,
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.400]  just ignore them. It'll drive them nuts. And then they'll stop. It turns out that this is an
[34:50.400 --> 34:56.800]  important skill for dealing with Republican candidates for governor. And President and President
[34:56.800 --> 35:02.320]  and President just don't don't pay attention. And you know, the up the new CEO of Twitter, just
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.840]  don't don't pay attention as we devote half the show. Really, I know. We're not doing very well,
[35:07.840 --> 35:14.640]  are we? There was gab, which was even right or wing. But anyway, Apple did take parlor off the
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.920]  store for three months, Google took it down for, I guess, half a year for content moderation.
[35:19.920 --> 35:27.360]  And to whatever degree the content that is now allowable on Twitter has changed under Musk's
[35:27.360 --> 35:34.640]  leadership, it is more in the direction of parlor and gab, right is more friendly to right wing
[35:35.200 --> 35:45.200]  things, people who post the the peppy peppy meme on ironically, yeah, that sort of stuff is to
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.280]  some degree, small or large, I don't, I'm not sure I don't see it. But you know, I use tweetbot. And
[35:51.280 --> 35:58.960]  I follow people who I want to follow. And so my Twitter content, if I, if I had a filter to, to
[35:58.960 --> 36:04.400]  block the meta discussion of Twitter itself, and Elon Musk, which, you know, those of you who do
[36:04.400 --> 36:09.280]  have such filters, and you know, that you don't feel a professional need to stay up to date on it,
[36:09.280 --> 36:15.760]  I'm so jealous. My Twitter feed has not changed significantly. I don't think I would know,
[36:15.760 --> 36:20.480]  you know, anything different. Yeah. And that was the that was, well, I mean,
[36:20.480 --> 36:24.320]  I had several breaking points. One was one was him, you know, bringing Trump back. That was the
[36:24.320 --> 36:30.400]  big one. And so I have not I've stopped posting, and I'm still and I'm winnowing down my followers,
[36:30.400 --> 36:39.120]  just so that I'm less inclined to go into tweetbot and read. But I'm down to not, you know,
[36:39.120 --> 36:47.200]  my, my feed now is a is sort of a trickle. But but that's the the idea that he would cut off
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.960]  third party apps was the other breaking point. Like if he had if he had not taken, you know,
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.720]  not put Trump back, but then cut off third party apps, there was no way I was ever going to go to
[36:56.720 --> 37:05.040]  the website and read this. Right. I Yeah, I'm so I'm a tweetbot man myself. But I Yeah, if he cut
[37:05.040 --> 37:10.400]  off third party apps, I don't know, I don't know that I completely stopped. But it would, I've
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.120]  really stopped checking Instagram regularly, maybe like once a week, it's over on my third home
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.040]  screen at this point. I think Twitter would sort of fall into that category. Maybe, I guess I'd
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.520]  still look at my mentions in the regular Twitter app. But I probably I it's hard to predict. But
[37:27.520 --> 37:35.280]  without tweetbot, I would probably just look at my mentions as opposed to looking at the main feed.
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.280]  And I know I've talked to people at Twitter, some some people it's not luckily I don't root for for
[37:41.280 --> 37:47.120]  layoffs. But because because so many people have have left or been laid off from Twitter recently,
[37:47.120 --> 37:54.480]  there are a lot of an unusual number of people willing to tweet or speak to reporters on the
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.680]  or post blog posts on the record with their name of their experience working at Twitter,
[37:59.680 --> 38:05.520]  right. And it's, you know, I don't have to point to one specific example, many, many people I've
[38:05.520 --> 38:11.680]  talked to privately, and I've seen tweets publicly have said that it was an ongoing never ending
[38:12.960 --> 38:19.440]  discussion with Apple over content moderation on Twitter. For years, this is not like a new thing
[38:19.440 --> 38:26.320]  under Elon Musk, and all of a sudden, in the last four weeks, and now Apple is putting its eye of
[38:26.320 --> 38:33.040]  sore on on the content that's on Twitter. It has been never ending throughout the entire history
[38:33.040 --> 38:41.280]  of the App Store that Apple has, you know, and and random, you know, a famous famously, you know,
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.480]  Twitter's one of these many, many companies whose release notes for an update is always bug fixes
[38:46.480 --> 38:54.240]  and improvements, right. But it's just another random, whatever version point three update with
[38:54.240 --> 38:59.200]  some bug fixes and improvements, and it sales right through and then a week later, they've got
[38:59.200 --> 39:04.240]  the point four version, which is just more bug fixes and improvements. And it's really no major
[39:04.240 --> 39:10.240]  new features or changes. But all of a sudden, now it's held up an app review. And app review gets
[39:10.240 --> 39:16.560]  back to them and says something like I typed in hashtag boobs, and look at, you know, and then
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.440]  there's screenshots of, you know, and there is there's actually, there's actual pornography,
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.480]  if you go looking for it, there is pornographic or at least nude, nude content on Twitter.
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.560]  And yeah, every once in a while, they would I would do a search for something, you know,
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.280]  somewhere, it's a weird thing. And then it'd be like, Whoa, I mean, you get you get things that
[39:35.280 --> 39:42.400]  come up, you know, like, sometimes you get unexpected results. And it's, it was like,
[39:42.400 --> 39:46.400]  God, I really don't feel like there's a whole other use for this site that I'm not taking
[39:46.400 --> 39:55.200]  advantage of. Right. It is it's actually tumblr cultivated that did an entire significant subculture
[39:55.200 --> 40:02.480]  on on tumblr is related to adult content. You know, I don't know if it I guess it used to be
[40:02.480 --> 40:08.160]  anyway. And now they're, you know, I think they I don't know if they timed it for this, or I think
[40:08.160 --> 40:14.000]  it's, it's funny that that, you know, pretty much a few days after Musk took over, and these things
[40:14.000 --> 40:22.240]  started happening, tumblr changed its policy to allow nudity. But there was a lot of a lot of the
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.640]  reaction to that when when Apple said, Look, you know, you can't have your we're not gonna allow
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.640]  your app in the App Store if you have this content. And the app is so important to tumblr
[40:30.640 --> 40:35.680]  that they actually had to concede to Apple and say, Okay, we're going to change our rules for
[40:35.680 --> 40:42.640]  this content tumblr wide, just to make sure that our apps can stay in the App Store. And the I
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.640]  would say the number one response to that from people who were on tumblr side, not Apple side
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.840]  was, well, wait, what about Twitter, you can search for some of the same terms, you're saying
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.840]  I search for term, whatever, again, hashtag boobs on tumblr. And I get this. But if I search for the
[40:59.840 --> 41:06.080]  same hashtag on Twitter, I get very similar stuff. And there's no problem with Twitter. Again,
[41:06.720 --> 41:12.720]  Apple's policies with the App Store are inscrutable externally. And that inscrutability
[41:12.720 --> 41:23.040]  is perhaps the biggest problem with with the App Store. But I guess from the outside, my guess is
[41:23.040 --> 41:31.440]  that Twitter was across a certain too big to fail line that tumblr wasn't in Apple's eyes. And
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.560]  because of their size and importance that they, you know, could get away with more that a smaller
[41:39.200 --> 41:47.120]  app or network couldn't, I think it's very certain that an upstart app, like a parlor or a gab that
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.920]  had the same content under hashtag boobs, that Twitter did would get flagged and held up and
[41:53.920 --> 41:58.640]  said, you know, yeah, that Twitter, but anyway, over the years, many, many times, though,
[41:58.640 --> 42:04.640]  there were times where, you know, hashtag boobs would flag an App Store review and an update
[42:04.640 --> 42:13.360]  would be held for weeks, you know, it people who run really big apps, you know, from companies
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.000]  that you've heard of major, major apps, have war stories about minor updates being held.
[42:20.560 --> 42:28.160]  And sometimes it is, for obvious reasons, like a tweak to like the Netflix, what happens if you
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.680]  don't have a Netflix account, and you want to sign up and net, you know, famously, several years ago,
[42:33.680 --> 42:39.760]  Netflix stopped taking in app signups, so they don't have to pay Apple, any commission. And what
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.520]  are arguing over the exact language of what's on that page to comply with Apple's weird,
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.200]  you're not allowed to talk about the rules. And you know, I wrote about this years ago,
[42:49.200 --> 42:54.320]  it's one of my favorite things ever, where Netflix had a phone number, and you could call the phone
[42:54.320 --> 43:00.640]  number and talk to a real human being and ask, Hey, I don't have a Netflix account, but I'm using
[43:00.640 --> 43:05.520]  the iPhone app, how do I get an account? And then they said, Oh, you need to go to a computer and
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.760]  then go to the netflix.com website, and you need to sign up there. And they, they can't put those
[43:11.760 --> 43:17.520]  words on the screen in the app. But they can put a phone number in the app, and you can, they can
[43:17.520 --> 43:23.360]  make it a tappable link, you know, like when you automatically dial it automatically dials, and
[43:23.360 --> 43:30.080]  then they have the money to have people answer the real people answer the phone, and tell you exactly
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.040]  what to do to get an account, which I thought was a very weird loophole, you know, and obviously not
[43:35.040 --> 43:42.720]  available to smaller companies. Unless you like imagine like me and you and a couple of pals,
[43:43.280 --> 43:46.320]  just put my phone number on there. Just put molten phone number in there.
[43:49.600 --> 43:52.080]  And every five minutes, you're just answering your phone, you know,
[43:52.080 --> 43:54.880]  like in the middle of dinner, and you're like, yeah, just go to our website.
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.600]  Chewing. Yeah. Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, sure. Here's what you're gonna do.
[44:01.600 --> 44:11.200]  So that's been happening. And so anyway, what what Musk is alleging, and it's in the news today,
[44:11.200 --> 44:16.320]  as we record, it sure will still be in the news tomorrow. But it's and it's sort of changing the
[44:16.320 --> 44:23.040]  narrative with the big publications that are on the anti big tech crusade, like the Washington
[44:23.040 --> 44:28.720]  Post and the New York Times, where all of a sudden now they're on Twitter and Elon Musk's side,
[44:28.720 --> 44:33.680]  because Apple is the clear, you know, in this battle, Apple's against anybody,
[44:33.680 --> 44:37.760]  pretty much Apple's Goliath, right? There's only a handful of companies where you could say that
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.600]  they're picking on somebody their own size, right? There's Google, Microsoft, even meta
[44:43.600 --> 44:49.760]  at this point has been reduced, right? But when Apple first instituted the app tracking
[44:49.760 --> 44:56.160]  transparency rules that apparently so adversely affected Facebook's ad revenue, they would be
[44:56.160 --> 45:02.080]  considered a peer to Apple, Twitter is not a peer to Apple in any way, size, revenue, whatever.
[45:03.600 --> 45:11.840]  But it the coverage I've seen today seems clearly on the it, they're taking Elon Musk at his word,
[45:11.840 --> 45:19.920]  and, and the slant is clearly that Apple's control over the App Store is problematic,
[45:19.920 --> 45:23.440]  you know, which it might be, right? It's this is the debate. You know, it really,
[45:23.440 --> 45:30.160]  I'm not saying it isn't, I'm just saying, I think it requires tremendous nuance. And they're taking
[45:30.160 --> 45:36.960]  the sort of it just, it is clear, you know, what I don't know what the legal term is, but,
[45:36.960 --> 45:42.560]  you know, true on its face, that it's just a huge problem that Apple has this control over
[45:42.560 --> 45:48.000]  Twitter's content. Musk is alleging that they're threatening to remove Twitter from the App Store.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.360]  I don't know that that's true. I don't believe anything he tweets.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.520]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, so I wouldn't,
[45:53.520 --> 46:01.920]  I wouldn't be surprised if what he's learning is that their updates get held up. And I wouldn't,
[46:01.920 --> 46:07.840]  I would actually be surprised if their recent updates and I know I actually install my updates
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.840]  manually. I don't have automatic App Store updates, just so I like to keep track of
[46:12.720 --> 46:16.560]  what's being updated. And then, you know, I just scroll through the list, and then I hit update
[46:16.560 --> 46:21.600]  all. I don't do it one by one. But I've noticed, you know, there have been Twitter app updates for
[46:21.600 --> 46:28.880]  iOS in recent weeks, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're seeing longer than usual delays while
[46:28.880 --> 46:35.040]  Apple has discussions over the content moderation. And, you know, and Musk's take is that Apple
[46:35.040 --> 46:40.400]  should have no say in Twitter's content moderation, and, you know, nor should Google. You know,
[46:40.400 --> 46:48.880]  that's his definition of free speech that that is one take. Yeah, it's weird, right? Because
[46:48.880 --> 46:57.360]  I mean, it in both of like this this case, and then we have epic, like nice app store rules are
[46:57.360 --> 47:09.360]  arcane and real dumb. But in large cases, but we have these two champions of breaking up the rules.
[47:09.360 --> 47:16.560]  And I don't like either. It they're both demi they're both doing for nefarious reasons,
[47:16.560 --> 47:22.320]  seemingly to me, right? I don't know that the epic was not the most sympathetic. Yeah,
[47:22.320 --> 47:28.000]  I mean, epic doesn't care about anybody, but epic, of course. Right. And, you know, they
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.040]  clearly sandbagged Apple by clearly violating the rules. Right. And so I saw even Tim Sweeney
[47:35.040 --> 47:41.760]  jumping into Twitter, you know, that's the CEO of epic CEO and co founder or founder of epic games,
[47:41.760 --> 47:48.000]  but you know, certainly the face of their public and legal battle against Apple over the app store
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.800]  rules was Tim Sweeney. You know, and I'll get you know, I don't agree with his angle. I don't agree
[47:52.800 --> 47:59.760]  with epics tactics. But I'll certainly give him credit for, you know, sticking his chin out,
[47:59.760 --> 48:06.560]  right on something that most companies seem very fearful. Nobody wants to people are fearful of
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.040]  Apple. And so people don't speak out about it, right? It's there's other, you know, certainly,
[48:11.920 --> 48:18.720]  you could make a phone book probably of companies with complaints about the way Apple manages the
[48:18.720 --> 48:23.760]  app store, the review process, and certainly the commission structure and the rules, the rules
[48:23.760 --> 48:30.800]  around routing around it by steering people to the web to pay without giving Apple a commission.
[48:31.520 --> 48:36.560]  And that's long been my take just to put it reiterate, you know, is that I think what Apple
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.760]  should have done long ago, they're doing it ever so slightly, like with the Japan Trade Commission
[48:41.760 --> 48:47.840]  agreement for a certain class of apps, their their, quote, unquote, reader apps, I just think
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.880]  they should open it up to anybody and let people say you can buy here, right here in the app right
[48:52.880 --> 49:00.640]  now. And it goes through Apple and Apple gets the cut, or click this link, and it opens in Safari
[49:00.640 --> 49:06.960]  outside the app, and you can pay there. And if you know, I think that that that that should just be
[49:06.960 --> 49:13.200]  something apps can do. And if you don't even want to offer the in app purchase, I think, you know,
[49:13.200 --> 49:17.920]  like Netflix, I think Netflix should just instead of a friggin phone number, they should just say
[49:17.920 --> 49:24.960]  sign in. Or if you need to sign up, tap, click this button, tap this button, and it'll go to
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.080]  the web, and you'll sign up there and then come back to the app and sign in with the account you
[49:30.080 --> 49:36.560]  created on the web. You know that the if the convenience of doing the commerce in app is so
[49:36.560 --> 49:42.480]  great, then let let there be a link to the web to prove it and you keep keep your cut in the app and
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.880]  do it for all classes of apps. And there you go, you know, and then it would solve so many problems,
[49:48.880 --> 49:55.120]  you know, and I get I and I also believe that it's fine if Apple opened that up like that to not
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.720]  allow it to be a browser that's in the app, you actually have to leave the app. And I know that
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.360]  many, many millions of people are confused about where they are. But at least people who know
[50:05.360 --> 50:11.280]  what's going on, would be able to see that they've left the app. And now they're in Safari, or
[50:11.280 --> 50:16.000]  whatever other, you know, whatever their default iOS browser is, because Apple did open that up
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  several years ago, where you could set Chrome or DuckDuckGo or any number Firefox or any number of
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.480]  third party browsers as you're, you know, just go but you're in your browser, you're out of the app
[50:26.480 --> 50:34.240]  in the browser, sign up there. And then the last leg of this conflict is Apple as an advertiser
[50:34.240 --> 50:41.680]  on Twitter. And this is sort of what prompted Elon Musk's foray. Apple has this tweet yesterday.
[50:41.680 --> 50:47.280]  It's a two tweets, but it could have been one. Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter.
[50:47.280 --> 50:53.520]  Do they hate free speech in America? What what's going on here at Tim Cook?
[50:57.120 --> 51:01.280]  What's the betting line on Tim Cook responding to that on Twitter?
[51:01.280 --> 51:06.720]  It's, it's got to be pretty tremendous. I'm gonna say it's no line. I think I think that
[51:06.720 --> 51:11.120]  could be it. You see it in game a lot. So now that that sports betting is legal, and there's
[51:11.120 --> 51:15.040]  these apps, and I don't know if you know this, but I like to I like to gamble occasionally. Oh,
[51:15.040 --> 51:21.280]  really? Yeah, you can bet during the game. So like, if you know, the Dallas Cowboys are playing
[51:21.280 --> 51:26.960]  the Minnesota Vikings like the other week, and is everybody expected a close game. But all of
[51:26.960 --> 51:33.920]  a sudden, it's not a close game. And Dallas is up 33 to three, you can still place bets. But it's
[51:33.920 --> 51:39.040]  like, at a certain point, maybe when it gets to 33 to three, or whatever the score was, at some
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.720]  point, they stop letting you bet that Dallas is going to win the game. They won't even offer like
[51:44.720 --> 51:50.240]  10,000 to one odds, you know, like that bet $10,000 to win $1, they won't even offer it,
[51:50.240 --> 51:55.280]  they just take it off. They're like, no, because I would say the odds of Tim Cook responding to
[51:55.280 --> 52:00.720]  this engaging on Twitter itself. We're off the board. Do you you couldn't even get like a 10,000
[52:00.720 --> 52:05.600]  to one odds on it? Yeah. Do you remember that? It was a few years ago, they did it. They did a
[52:05.600 --> 52:12.640]  joke at the beginning of an event where they were looking for a remote. Right? Yes. Yeah. He tweeted
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.240]  he tweeted, you know, it looked like he tweeted an accidental tweet. Yeah, we get it here quickly.
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.200]  Yeah. When it was just like it was a promo, you know, like a lead in for the, the event.
[52:23.200 --> 52:27.280]  Yeah, I do remember that. That was very funny. Yeah, that's the wildest thing that he's ever
[52:27.280 --> 52:31.680]  that he's ever tweeted. I mean, everything else is very by the numbers. And there's yeah,
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.920]  there's no way he's responding. Yeah, for like a 10am Pacific keynote kickoff at like 956
[52:37.920 --> 52:42.480]  at Tim Cook tweeted something weird like, has anybody seen it? You know, bring it to me on
[52:42.480 --> 52:47.280]  stage. And yeah, right, right. I think it's Can you get it here quickly? I have a screenshot of
[52:47.280 --> 52:51.440]  it. Because at the time, I was like, what the hell is this? What's going on? And I was like,
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.040]  what the hell is this? What's going on? And then and then like, you know, watching the event like,
[52:55.040 --> 53:01.600]  oh, it's a gag. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I'd say the odds were zero. And it makes
[53:03.360 --> 53:09.840]  Elon Musk look a little thirsty. There's a there's a certain there's a low all of this has
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.680]  there's a low energy vibe to it, though. Right. Josh Marshall, who writes the great,
[53:15.680 --> 53:20.240]  or founded and is still writes the editors blog at talking points memo, one of my favorite political
[53:20.240 --> 53:25.520]  sites, was tweeting about it and called it real low energy vibes and was laughing at it.
[53:27.040 --> 53:33.840]  I heard from somebody I and I reported I guess I you know, I don't don't claim to quote unquote
[53:33.840 --> 53:38.960]  report much but reported a day or two ago, that some source who had previously worked in Twitter's
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.920]  ad group told me that Twitter or Apple had been until recently, Twitter's number one advertiser
[53:45.920 --> 53:51.040]  by spend and the Washington Post today put a number on it and said that in the first quarter
[53:51.040 --> 53:57.520]  of the year, Apple spent $48 million, which made them the number one and it was 4% of Twitter's
[53:57.520 --> 54:08.160]  ad revenue. So not like essential, but, you know, 4% is what like one out of 22.
[54:08.160 --> 54:13.120]  And I was surprised that they were the largest. Yeah, I don't think I didn't really think about
[54:13.120 --> 54:18.560]  it very much. But I'm so surprised that Apple would be the one who was spending the most.
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.200]  Yeah, and they've, you know, but in hindsight, I guess it makes sense because I know that when
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.680]  they have product announcements, they'd like to buy those hash flags, they call them where,
[54:27.680 --> 54:33.760]  you know, you can get a custom hashtag and then it has like an animation that goes with it that
[54:33.760 --> 54:40.800]  you can buy a custom like button that makes the like button and Apple logo or the the logo,
[54:40.800 --> 54:46.080]  the logo, you know, the Apple likes to make a custom logo for each event announcement,
[54:46.080 --> 54:52.560]  you know, with the theme. So Apple has tends to promote their events like that. I don't know what
[54:52.560 --> 54:57.440]  else they do. I don't because I use tweet bots, so I don't see a lot of ads. Yeah, right. Yeah.
[54:57.440 --> 55:01.040]  On Twitter, that's probably why I mean, I probably would have seen lots of them when I was looking at
[55:01.040 --> 55:08.240]  the web, but and you know that unsurprisingly, they've cut their ad spend, according to Musk,
[55:08.240 --> 55:15.840]  almost entirely. And they're not alone. No, that post article listed quite a few major
[55:16.400 --> 55:20.400]  companies that have been coming back. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's a well known category brand
[55:20.400 --> 55:26.240]  advertisers, right? It is companies, you know, Apple's certainly a big one. But who else was
[55:26.240 --> 55:31.680]  on the list? I don't have it in front of me. But wasn't Ford one of them? Yeah, I think so.
[55:31.680 --> 55:39.200]  You know, it's major American brands, the type of brands that advertise in mass market,
[55:39.840 --> 55:46.480]  like on TV sports, right, who advertises during big football games, those type of companies
[55:46.480 --> 55:52.240]  have pulled their Twitter ad spend. And it makes sense. advertisers are incredibly conservative,
[55:52.240 --> 55:57.120]  not conservative in the political sense, but conservative. It just in the plain meaning of
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.320]  the word conservative, and they don't want controversy. They want and they Yeah, and so
[56:02.320 --> 56:07.920]  yeah, not surprisingly, a lot of these are like blue chip, sort of, yeah, AT&T, American Express,
[56:07.920 --> 56:15.520]  Chevrolet, Chipotle, Citigroup, CNN, Dell, goes on and on. Yeah, but did you know, think about
[56:15.520 --> 56:20.560]  what unites those brands, they're big companies with with established brands, and they don't want
[56:20.560 --> 56:29.280]  their brand associated with, say, not Nazis, right wing, you know, white nationalism? No,
[56:29.280 --> 56:35.280]  yeah, probably don't want my hashtag, hashtag, you know, anywhere near that, or in people's minds.
[56:35.280 --> 56:44.880]  They also value tremendously predictability, right? And, you know, so like, when you
[56:44.880 --> 56:53.840]  say you want to promote the iPhone 14, and you're gonna have your jaws, and you're thinking about
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.280]  where are we going to spend our December ads on TV? And you're like, we should put some on 60
[56:59.280 --> 57:05.120]  minutes. And it's like, you don't need to call CBS and say, like, hey, what's going to be on 60
[57:05.120 --> 57:10.880]  minutes on the December, you know, 11th episode, you kind of know what you're going to get, you
[57:10.880 --> 57:15.840]  know, you know, it's predictable. It is, you know, you know who the audience is, you know what the
[57:15.840 --> 57:22.160]  ratings are going to be. And you know, you know, the sort of content that 60 minutes puts on their
[57:22.720 --> 57:28.800]  weekly news TV show. Yeah. When you advertise during a football game, you know what you're
[57:28.800 --> 57:35.840]  going to get, you're going to get a football game. Right? What could steer advertisers away
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.880]  from something like football? Well, ratings, obviously, would be the big thing. If football
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.520]  becomes unpopular over the years, I mean, baseball has certainly become less popular
[57:45.520 --> 57:52.000]  over our lifetimes to go back to baseball. It's no longer the most popular team sport in in America.
[57:52.000 --> 57:56.800]  But people still advertise because millions of people still watch the whole concussion thing
[57:56.800 --> 58:02.240]  with football would be a thing that, you know, it's it's clearly the biggest danger to the NFL
[58:02.240 --> 58:08.880]  going forward, because it is a serious issue. It's real. It's documented. And it is incredibly
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.120]  controversial, right? That's a thing that would hurt that that's like the one thing that could
[58:13.120 --> 58:18.560]  hurt the NFL in terms of their ad revenue. That is like a drop in the bucket compared to where
[58:18.560 --> 58:23.600]  Twitter is these days in terms of predictability, right? And you know, who knows what the hell is
[58:23.600 --> 58:28.960]  going to be on Twitter in a week? So why in the world would you why not wait for this to settle
[58:28.960 --> 58:36.640]  down? It's going to settle down this. This tumultuousness cannot. It can't keep up, right?
[58:36.640 --> 58:45.680]  I don't think I know. It doesn't show any signs of abating. It's been going on for weeks now.
[58:45.680 --> 58:50.720]  I don't know. So but my take on this controversy, though, is it seems as though it boils down to
[58:50.720 --> 58:59.760]  politically. Elon Musk is, in my view, is clearly not trying to stake out some middle
[59:01.200 --> 59:06.640]  both sides middle ground. He's surprising, which is what I thought he would do. But I don't think
[59:06.640 --> 59:10.960]  I followed him closely enough. I think people who did follow him closer, therefore made better
[59:10.960 --> 59:16.000]  predictions that he really does seem to lean right politically, or at least has for several years.
[59:16.000 --> 59:23.920]  Yeah, and is really making moves that are only to the side of placating people on the US political
[59:23.920 --> 59:29.440]  right, and making it friendlier for people who were banned to come back and to post things that
[59:29.440 --> 59:36.800]  previously weren't allowed. And that there's no good news in this for people on the US political
[59:36.800 --> 59:47.200]  left. And it's no good news at all for anybody. LGBTQ part of the community or friendly to the
[59:47.200 --> 59:55.360]  community allied with that community, nothing, no good news and and some significant bad news,
[59:55.360 --> 01:00:05.120]  you know, people who were banned for truly vile content by speaking out against that,
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.680]  that that community, you know, in ways that I genuinely believe are harmful. I know that
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:18.800]  this term stochastic terrorism is sort of new. But I, I, you know, I think it's real. I think
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:24.480]  it's a real thing that you can speak in coded terms and never call for violence, but use
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:35.440]  language and tone and dog whistle code words that implicitly imply that violence is, is actually
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:43.440]  called is actually called for. And that the stochastic is like a statistics term. But that
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.200]  means that it you can't predict anything specific, but you can, you can take this and predict that
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:55.040]  it's going to happen at some point. You know, it's like you can't predict exactly where and
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.640]  when an earthquake is going to occur. But you know that Callum because of the fault lines,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.040]  there are going to be there are going to be earthquakes and you can take this rhetoric on
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:11.600]  Fox News. And, and you can't predict Oh, that means that in Peoria, Illinois, some guy's going
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:17.200]  to go nuts and try to shoot up a place or something like that. But you can't predict where,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.920]  but you can predict that it's going to happen in the aggregate. And I think it's, you know,
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.360]  you know, a shocker. I think it's terrible. And I think it's something that, you know,
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.480]  something like Twitter should fight against. He's not interested. No, I don't think though,
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.240]  I really don't think that Twitter I don't know, who knows what Apple has said, maybe Apple,
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.560]  you know, has said, you know, we, hey, you guys are in jeopardy of us removing the app
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.840]  from the store. And, you know, I wouldn't be so maybe it maybe that's actually how bad it's gotten.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.360]  I think somebody told him about the the op-ed piece that his former employee wrote
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.720]  in the New York Times. And he, he then reacted to that.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:06.480]  Right. That's the former head of Trust and Safety, Joel Roth. And I guess that's where I know that,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.480]  you know, that Apple's had a continuing, you know, he was forthright about it, that they've
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.960]  had a never-ending discussion with Apple and Google about the content on the network. So,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.640]  you know, it's, it is interesting to think that Apple's, you know, there's money flowing both
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.240]  ways, where Elon Musk is now upset that he's learned that any kind of subscription they sell,
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.840]  they're going to have to pay Apple a significant cut of it. And he's also mad,
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:40.560]  he's also mad now that Apple is choosing not to give Twitter money. I mean, and again,
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.440]  50 million and a quarter isn't huge amount of money, but it's 4% of their ad revenue,
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.280]  and ad revenue is the biggest thing. So it's, you know, and, and they're not the only one.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.600]  And so, I mean, all these other ones, I mean, everything adds up. He's just using Apple as a,
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.960]  as a particular target. Yeah, like a proxy. Well, and I, but I also don't think you have to be,
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.000]  but I also don't think you have to be, I don't see how anybody could deny it, that a company as
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  influential as Apple and as respected for their brand and marketing expertise, right? I mean,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.600]  it's actually the knock against Apple in tech circles forever against people who don't like
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.040]  their products are, is that it's just, it's all smoke and mirrors and marketing, and they trick
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.880]  people, you know, with clever marketing into buying inferior computers, you know, right. I
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:34.640]  mean, you and I have been covering this, we've made like a careers out of it, that their marketing
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.480]  is so good that people who don't like their products think that's why people buy the products
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.000]  and therefore that other people would follow their lead, right? Like, well, we're not as good
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.920]  at marketing and advertising as Apple. And if Apple is pulling out of Twitter, then we should
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:56.560]  pull out of Twitter. And vice versa, like if Apple started advertising on some new, you know,
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.680]  TikTok, right? If Apple, all of a sudden the word comes out that Apple is spending a significantly
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.160]  increased amount of money on TikTok, a lot of other advertisers and smaller companies would
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.760]  say, hey, if it's good for Apple, it might be good for us, maybe we should increase our spend on
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.600]  TikTok. I think that's probably obviously true that people follow the leader, and Apple is a
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:22.880]  leader in marketing, and therefore Musk is trying to cut it off. But it's also funny to me that he's
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:28.960]  done it by highlighting the fact, right? Like, that's what makes him so-
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.480]  I mean, he thinks he's going to win this, right? And he thinks he's going to bully them into
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:40.480]  coming back, I guess? Or is it just, is it an effect of like saying, look how obnoxious I am
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.480]  being to Apple, imagine what I'm going to do to you?
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:49.280]  Right? I guess? Maybe? I don't even know. I'm not quite sure. Yeah, I don't know how much of it he
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.440]  goes, you know, much like our former president. I don't know how much he does, who I believe-
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.160]  He's surprisingly like him, you know? I mean, he is shockingly similar in his tweeting style,
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.200]  as well as, you know, seemingly his personal style.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.400]  Yeah, I think so too. And including the fact that he's obviously very cunning,
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.760]  and he has a very good sense of how things will play to his bass, you know, for lack of a better
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:20.000]  word, and knows his bass. And, you know, it's like the Pied Piper knows exactly what music
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.320]  the kids want to listen to, you know? He knows the tune, and those of us who aren't
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.400]  in the demo, right? We hear the Pied Piper's music and we're like, I don't get it, right?
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.840]  That doesn't sound- What's this crap?
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.640]  Yeah, what's this crap? Why are you guys following this guy? I don't even like that.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.400]  He knows that. I don't know how it's going to play out. But I do think on the App Store front,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:57.840]  if I were at Apple, I would be having very serious meetings, strategy meetings to deal
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:06.800]  with it. Because the one thing Apple hasn't really dealt with with the App Store commissions is
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:16.160]  a high-profile complainant. Epic is the closest, right?
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.800]  Yeah. I mean, Epic is pretty close though, because not because of Epic being Epic,
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.920]  but because Fortnite was so popular. Or is so popular.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.000]  Exactly, right. And that's what people are bringing that up with, you know, well,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.480]  Apple's not going to just remove- I've seen people say, no matter what Twitter does,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.560]  they're not going to just boot it off the App Store because they've got 200 million users.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.000]  But there were like, I don't know, like 100 million iOS Fortnite users. I mean,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.200]  it was massively popular and they booted it. But they booted it for actions that Epic took that
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.080]  could not- that weren't in any gray zone at all. By Epic's own admission, right,
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.240]  Epic, for those who don't remember, put an update to Fortnite into the App Store
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:09.760]  with no mention of this feature being embedded in the app. And the app, I don't know if it was
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.560]  timed or if it was like they would phone home and when Epic flipped a switch on their server,
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.640]  then the app would know, okay, the switch has been flipped. And then all of a sudden,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:23.520]  the app that had already gone through App Store review and was on people's phones
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.960]  started offering people the ability to buy V-Bucks, their in-game currency,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:38.240]  without going through the App Store. And Apple took none too kindly to it and within four days
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.240]  had removed Fortnite from the App Store. And it still, you know, lo these many years later in
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:52.160]  major lawsuit that Apple won still isn't back. And I guess the one thing they didn't do, Apple
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.160]  did not flip the kill switch that removed Fortnite from people's phones. I'm not even sure what that
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.200]  switch is. I don't know that it deletes it. I think what they could do is remove a certification
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.120]  and then the app wouldn't run on your phones. You'd still have it taking up space on your phone,
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.280]  but it wouldn't run. They didn't do that. But the way Fortnite works and I think most,
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:22.720]  just about any multiplayer game, like the whole point of Fortnite is you're playing against,
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.640]  I don't even know if there is a single player mode. I don't think so. I don't think it would
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:33.040]  make any sense. So it's only multiplayer and they go, you know, if you're not on the latest version,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:40.880]  how and everybody else on every other platform like PCs and consoles is running a future version
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.080]  with different maps and different characters, the old version can no longer play. So it effectively
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.520]  killed the Fortnite, even without making the binary not run on your phones. It effectively
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.560]  killed Fortnite. So they did it. But that was, you know, Epic declared war, right? Epic by doing that.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.320]  I don't see Apple doing that with Twitter. I really don't. But they might, you know, if it
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:09.360]  comes to it, if push came to shove and something was that alarming to Apple content wise, I think
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:15.280]  the fact that they did it to Fortnite and they were making, I don't know, I don't know how much
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:22.160]  money Apple was making from Fortnite on iOS, but it was significant money because people do spend,
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.360]  players of Fortnite do spend a lot of money in game. And that's why Epic, I mean, if there
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.920]  weren't in game purchases, Epic wouldn't have even bothered, right? This wouldn't be an issue. So
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.000]  there's a lot of money at stake. And Apple was making a lot of money from Fortnite and did it.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.320]  Apple doesn't make a lot of money from Twitter. There are very few in app purchases. The only in
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.880]  app purchases that I'm aware of are, well, there's Twitter blue, blue, which I, you know, is the thing
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.840]  that Musk wants to boost. But most people I know, I know very few people who pay for it. And then
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:59.120]  you can do the super follow thing where there's like 2000 users of Twitter who've opted into this
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:05.920]  super follow program where you get like a, it's like a member full type thing, but on Twitter.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.560]  So you can, if I were to offer super follows, which I don't, but you could super follow me for
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.400]  $3 a month and I'd get a dollar a month or something like that. And then I can post special
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.840]  tweets that only show up to the people who are paying me, you know, in videos and I don't know,
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.600]  whatever the features. It's not a very popular feature so far. So it's not like Apple would be
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.400]  losing money by booting Twitter like they did with Fortnite. So I think they might, but I just
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.760]  think, I just think Musk is taking umbrage at the fact that Apple has any control over their
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.080]  software updates at all. Yeah. And people, but, but a lot of people are taking him at his word
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.520]  that Apple has already threatened to remove the app from the store. I don't think that's happened.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.960]  No, I don't think that's happened either. But who knows? I don't know. It's, it's interesting.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.040]  I do think though, I don't know. Where do you see it going with the money though? I, I do
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.760]  that, that I'll just circle back to that before we close off the topic. But I do think
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.520]  Elon Musk can shine a light on this. I mean, cause that's the other funny tweet that he had
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:19.280]  yesterday that was positing it as, and again, it's very, for lack of a better word, Trumpian,
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.880]  you know, the way that you, like one of Trump's big ticks of course is, many people are saying,
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:34.080]  right? So Musk doesn't, Musk doesn't do that one, but he, this is very Trumpian where, where
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:40.080]  you alleged that something that has been out in the open was done in secret. Here, here's his
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.280]  tweet. Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their app store?
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:54.240]  That's the whole tweet. But I loved your, your, your, your end, your final sentence when you
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.440]  wrote that up yesterday. Yes. I think I recall hearing something about this once.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.560]  But Ben Thompson says, Ben, our friend of the show, actual friend, literal friend of the show,
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.440]  Ben Thompson says that he was asked by several people yesterday, is this true? You know,
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.400]  that there are people who don't know that Apple, you know, that don't pay attention to this closely
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.440]  people outside the tech circle. You know, which I guess should not be surprising.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.200]  I think they're, they're probably the most people's concern is,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.240]  does that mean they charge 30% more? Right.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.320]  As opposed to, Oh, it's the same, you know, it's the same, then they find out it's the same price.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:40.160]  They're like, Oh, I don't care. Yeah. And yeah, cause that's my, my take too is that,
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.520]  all right, once these people who didn't know about it, are they then outraged or are they
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.960]  not surprised at all? I mean, you and I know this, but from having so many friends who are
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:58.160]  app developers full-time that, or especially in the earlier days of the app store, when I think
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:06.800]  there were, there was a lot more indie app action on the iOS app store. But then people would go
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.080]  and they'd say, Oh, well, what do you do? And you're like, I make iPhone apps. And they're like,
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.360]  Oh, so you work for Apple. And they're like, no, no, I make them on my own. And they're very
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.160]  confused. And that there were a lot of people maybe still are who assume that just about
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.640]  anything that's not from another big company on the app store is from Apple, you know?
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.920]  And again, that makes no sense if you know anything, but people, you know, they're not,
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.800]  they're not paid to know anything, you know, they're, it's not, people don't need to know
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.200]  that, but an awful lot of people think like indie games are effectively all like Apple arcade,
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.120]  right? That, that Apple is paying for them and that the money goes to Apple.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.360]  Yeah. I mean, I didn't don't think about it that much just because.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.160]  Yeah. So I, I actually know better. I actually, so I actually think there are a lot of people
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.360]  who would be surprised that Apple quote unquote only takes 30% of the sale. And they're like,
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.880]  70% goes to somebody else. That's not what it sounds like a good deal. Right. And it's, you
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.440]  know, I think people understand. It wasn't, I mean, when Amazon had, you know, well, it was
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.360]  like book sales at least right. At least it used to be this way. When you wish, when you independently
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.080]  sold a book through Amazon, they took like 90%. Didn't they back, you know, before the iPad,
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.760]  some ridiculously large amount. I don't, I'm sure they don't do that anymore, but.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:30.720]  Yeah. Something like that. It was, it was crazy and it didn't, I don't know. I don't remember,
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:38.240]  but it was, it was, it was not as, it was not as friendly to the creators for lack of a better
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:46.560]  summary. But it relatively, but I do think, you know, I, so I don't know that Apple is in trouble.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.640]  I, I, in fact, I would say, I don't think Apple is in trouble with their app store
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.560]  situation just because now they have a high profile opponent who is going to publicize it
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:04.000]  endlessly, but it's, it's uncharted territory for them. Right there. They, they dealt with Epic.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.480]  Epic was the one who really put their, their chin out there. And they're dealing with government
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.560]  regulators here in the U S and especially in Europe regarding this and companies like Spotify
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:22.240]  doing it the traditional way by petitioning regulators and writing white papers and submitting,
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.840]  you know, things through the process as opposed to just bleeding it out on Twitter. But it,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.320]  you know, I think it puts them in uncharted territory and it's, you know, again, it's
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:38.560]  unpredictability is what makes Twitter much less desirable as an advertising venue for brand
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:45.200]  advertisers right now. But the unpredictability works in Musk's favor for a public argument.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:52.720]  For a public argument. Yeah. It's, it's hard to strategize against an unpredictable opponent
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.880]  is one way to put it. Right. All right. Let me take a, a break here and thank our next sponsor.

[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:57.280]  My thanks to Squarespace. Should we say away from Twitter?
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.520]  Yeah, I was going to say it's an exhausting topic. It is led this point. It was fun at
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.760]  the beginning, and now it's got to the point where it's like every day is another.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:14.720]  Let's segue from Twitter then to Mastodon, which I have not really written about or talked about.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:22.560]  It is what you you're on it and using it. So why don't you describe Mastodon for people?
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.680]  I'm sure everybody's heard about it, but it's. Hmm.
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.400]  Yeah, so it's, I mean, from a user perspective, it seems a bit like early Twitter. A lot of the
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.760]  apps are a little clunky. You either use the web interface or you use an app that's clunky.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.000]  The nice thing is that there are a number of apps, at least on the iPhone. There's only a couple on
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:56.720]  the Mac, and none of them are great. But the idea is this is a server-based thing that anybody can
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:03.520]  set up their own server, and then the servers talk to each other and you join a particular server.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:09.280]  So I happen to join mastodon.social, which is the largest one, and I think has since cut off
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.240]  adding new people, at least temporarily, because they had so many people who were
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.240]  switching from Twitter to Mastodon that they couldn't handle the load. And, you know,
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.800]  people are doing this for not really any money, I guess. I mean, you know, he has a,
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:29.520]  he has a Patreon. I do contribute to the Patreon and like, you know, like if you,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:35.120]  if you work for a company like, I think it's the company that makes the tap bots.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.440]  They have their own, they're running their own server now. And it looks like they are going to do
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.680]  a client map. So that I'm looking forward to that.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.840]  The makers of Tweetbot.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.280]  The makers of Tweetbot. Yeah. And I don't know what else to say about it. It's much
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.840]  more confusing than Twitter. Certainly joining is very much, much more confusing than Twitter
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:05.200]  because you have to pick an instance to join. And then your handle is like, well, you know, I'm,
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:13.760]  it's mastodon.social slash at molts. That's my whole user ID. And it becomes
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.760]  complicated trying to figure out how to link to tweets. It becomes complicated trying to figure
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.360]  out how to link to someone that you want, you know, if you want to follow them or have other
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:31.600]  people follow them or whatever, or yourself. So a lot of it is difficult to manage. And so I think
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.960]  for lots of people, it's not going to be easy to use. It's certainly not as easy to use as Twitter.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:43.280]  Right. They call it the Fediverse it is because it's federated. So the, the, the universe of
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:50.720]  federated websites or services that are, and it's not just Mastodon. It's called activity pub,
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:58.640]  I believe is the sort of pro the open protocol. Yeah. So, and a lot of, a lot of other services
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:07.280]  are starting to tie into that. Right. Tumblr has promised it's not there yet, but micro dot blog
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:14.400]  from again, actual friend of the show, Manton Reese, which is not Mastodon, but is micro
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.600]  blogging, which is like, you can post really short a note. You don't need a subject or anything. You
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.920]  just post a little short thing. You, when you follow people on microblog, you can at reply them
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:33.680]  and it's Twitter like at a very high level. And by integrating with these protocols,
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:43.120]  your micro dot blog account can. Federate with Mastodon what you can do and what works across
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:49.360]  this is confusing because it isn't centralized. You know, the analogy every, you know, the
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.320]  analogy actually works and it's modeled, I guess, on email in some way where you, like you said,
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:03.680]  you're at molts at Mastodon dot social. So you've got two at symbols, your name and your, the at
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:11.280]  your instance name. And if somebody else is on, there's another big one called Mastodon dot online
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:19.280]  and somebody else could be molts at Mastodon dot online. And there's, you know, so that your name
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.640]  is not unique except on your instance, but that's just like email where there's only one. Yeah.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:34.560]  Jane Doe at gmail.com. God bless her if that's a real person, but you know, there's all there
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:43.200]  can only be one username at domain for email. There can only be one username at domain for
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:49.920]  Mastodon, but you can, it, and again, email used to work like this way back in the nineties,
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.480]  in the early days when all of the emails through like Pine and Elm on the terminal,
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.640]  your local users, like when I was at Drexel University, I didn't need to know their full
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:07.360]  address. I just needed their username, you know, so I was UJ Gruber, undergrad J Gruber. It was my
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:12.800]  assigned email address in the computer science department. I could email, if you were there,
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.600]  UJ molts, and I wouldn't need to type in the rest of your email address. If it was just your username
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:26.560]  I was on there, you know, and now, you know, my email client was the server.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:34.880]  So you can do that on Mastodon, like, so I'm on Mastodon dot social as well, and I can just
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.640]  add molts you without the rest of it and it'll work. This, but to me, that's a little confusing,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:46.240]  right? It's, and email quickly got away from that where no matter, even if you were at work
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:53.760]  and everybody has the same at company.com address, you still are sending email to the username
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.800]  at company.com. I mean, then the nice thing that it allows that having those, these different
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:07.360]  instances allow is that you can, I mean, if it works out correctly, you could be on an instance
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.760]  where either it's your company or it's a group of people that you share an interest with.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:19.200]  And when you go, you can look at just the timeline for that instance. And that has benefits. I'm not
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:23.680]  taking advantage of any of those benefits because I happen to be on the largest instance and looking
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.960]  at it is just, you know, it's useless because it's just a constant stream of random posts from
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:35.760]  different people. Right. It's, it's effectively like looking at it because Mastodon dot social
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:42.080]  is so big. It is the biggest. It's effectively like looking at all of Twitter in the, in the
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.560]  early days when there were thousands of users or a hundred thousand users, not hundreds of millions.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:55.920]  But you could, and there are smaller instances that maybe only have a hundred people or only
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:02.160]  friends, you know, somebody can set up a Mastodon instance. And, you know, in theory, I could set
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:07.200]  one up and have only former guests of the talk show on. And if you wanted an account, you know,
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.720]  maybe there'd be, you know, so there'd be like two dozen people on the instance. It's, it's not the
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.280]  worst idea. I already agree. It's a great idea. I think it's a really solid idea. I just think that
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:26.160]  it does. I mean, well, it does not always work. Right. I effectively, I think the idea that it's
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.200]  going to lead to a fantastic outcome is idealistic and I'm certainly rooting for it. And again,
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:37.840]  I hate to be the rainer on the parade. I guess you don't piss on a parade, but you could, but
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.200]  let's just call it rain. I hate to be the weather, weather man calling for rain on the parade,
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:53.040]  but I don't, I don't see it working out as a, as a replacement for Twitter. But I will say,
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.480]  I will say that. I mean, I have, but I've been able to, it has, it has effectively replaced.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.480]  It has replaced the aspect of Twitter, which is like being a part of a community and being able to
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:12.480]  see posts from other people who I know online. And I mean, the thing that it hasn't done is replace,
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.640]  you know, the news aspect of it very well, because there aren't any, I mean, there are some,
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:24.720]  but there aren't very many professional news organizations that have accounts on there to
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:31.200]  follow or, or, or like, you know, entertainment stuff. I want to know, you know, I'm interested in
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:37.040]  because I do a podcast about dumb superhero shows, you know, that kind of stuff. So it, it's a work
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:41.760]  in progress, but you know, I do see more and more people joining it and I do see more and more
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.680]  organizations joining it. Right. And Neil dash was on my show two episodes ago and mentioned,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.120]  there's a two, I'll put the link in the show notes again, it's in the Neil dash show,
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:56.240]  but there's a couple of tools, including one that's made with the Neil's company's tool glitch
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:04.400]  called feta finder, F E D fed. If finder, not like Kevin Fed, what was that guy's name? He
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:10.320]  married Britney Spears. Yeah. Federer, not him and not Roger Federer. It's about the Federation
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.280]  of Mastodon instances, but you can use feta finder. You log in with your Twitter credentials.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.200]  It crawls through, you give it permission, it crawls through your Twitter followers
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:24.800]  and you can do things like there's a, I, I should put this in the show notes to the link
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:30.240]  to the recommended, what do you do if you're moving to Mastodon or just even if you're staying
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.120]  on Twitter, but are, are adding Mastodon to your social presence, how do you let people discover
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:42.160]  you? There are recommended ways of putting it in, putting your, your Mastodon ID in your bio
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.680]  for Twitter and a tool like feta finder will crawl through all of your followers. The people
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:53.520]  you follow look for those, Hey, this person you follow on Twitter, they've got this thing in
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:01.040]  their bio, their so-and-so at Mastodon, whatever on Mastodon, and then you can subscribe to them
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.920]  on, on Mastodon. And it's, you know, it is, it's, it's super, it's fun to see it moving fast.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:15.680]  It, there is absolutely positively a spirit of the 20 year ago open web that, that, you know,
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:21.840]  it, you know, never went away, but obviously went through a long cycle where the, the internet
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:30.880]  was ever increasingly dominated by an incredibly large instances to borrow the, the, the, the
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.840]  Mastodon term, right? Facebook is an incredibly, you know, the largest it's hard, you know,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.760]  literally with three or 4 billion users as large as a social network could be without
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:48.000]  interplanetary networking to other civilizations, right? As so long as the internet is limited to
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:55.280]  earth, Facebook is as big as anything could get. But even email, right? Email used to be everybody,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:29:01.760]  you know, 20 some years ago, there were very few people in my address book who had the same
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  domain name for their email, right? It was all, you know, everybody had, you know, either a
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:13.200]  personal domain or a school domain, and now it's all gmail.com or iCloud.com or whatever,
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:19.440]  you know, that, that a handful of big instances won out. But there's tools for that. And that's,
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.080]  that's very fun. Yeah. I think eventually we'll get to the point where, I mean,
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:32.240]  I would imagine we'll get to the point where services like I'm trying to think of this
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.600]  Dreamhost, which is one of the services that I use currently. You know, they, they, they have these
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.040]  one-click installs for things like WordPress. I would imagine that they will set up one-click
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.480]  installs for a Mastodon instance at some point. The trick of course, is that you run into the
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.640]  same problems that Twitter experiences. If you're going to run your own instance, that's just you,
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.840]  that's fine. But if you're going to run an instance that is like, well, I'm going to,
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:57.280]  cause I thought, well, maybe I should set one up and like invite some people to it.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:01.120]  And then you suddenly have to become the moderator for that instance. Right.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.600]  And you're on the hook for everything. And this has been, and this has been an issue with the
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.160]  early, you know, with this, with this transition of a lot of people fleeing Twitter and going to
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:17.280]  Mastodon is you're running into lots of moderation clashes. And one of the things that's one of the
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:24.560]  things that's very well, that is sort of a cultural feature that's often used on Mastodon is content
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:31.200]  warnings. So it's built into the system that you can, you know, obscure your post with a content
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:36.320]  warning and write, you know, this is about whatever it is. And then if people don't want to
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:42.080]  see what it is, you know, like, you know, like grizzly murder, you could put it as a content
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:48.320]  warning or, you know, politics or whatever. And, you know, and people who are, who are okay with
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:54.720]  going ahead to read it can click the button and then see the post. And you know, a lot of
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.840]  people of color came over from Twitter to Mastodon and were just, you know, posting things
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:06.080]  about racism and not putting them behind content warning warnings because they shouldn't really
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:14.640]  have to, but that's the kind of thing that riled people on Mastodon. And so they would, you know,
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.000]  get, take umbrage and tell them that they should be putting content warnings about this content
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.160]  about racism, which is a really bad look for people to do that. Because if you go around and
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.160]  tell people of color that they should not be talking about racism openly, then you're basically
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:35.680]  just, you know, providing cover for racism. So these kinds of things, these kinds of problems
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.680]  have crept up here and there. I really feel like most, I mean, like there were a couple of
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:45.920]  moderation problems on Mastodon Social. I think the, you know, the guy who runs that instance
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:51.600]  responded pretty well to, to those and, you know, said these, okay, this is a mistake.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.320]  I've issued apologies for both of these things. This is what we're going to try and do to go,
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:01.280]  you know, going forward to do this better. We're still looking for more, more moderators because
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.320]  these people, you know, flooded over from Twitter to Mastodon and, and they can't keep up with
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:14.800]  the moderation. So, you know, it's a lot of, a lot of growing pains and I, you know, I think
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.400]  I feel like for the most part, everybody's trying to work them out, but well, you know,
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:23.840]  it's a work in progress for sure. I sympathize with the long-time Mastodon users. I don't
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:30.320]  remember what happened, but apparently I signed up for Gruber at Mastodon.social in 2018. It seems
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:36.400]  like listening to other podcasts, like ATP. There's a lot of other people in our circle
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.320]  who did the same thing. I don't remember what it was. I don't remember.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.360]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was something politically related. I believe a lot of us went over and
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:54.000]  started setting up Mastodon instances. There's a lot, there's a lot I don't remember from around
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:01.600]  2018. Yeah, trying not to. But I had signed up for it then, but obviously there was some,
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:08.160]  you know, many thousands, I don't know, tens of thousands of people who've been actively using
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:16.400]  Mastodon for four years and have created their own culture and were very happy. You know, it's,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:22.800]  it's like, you know, homesteading, right? Like, so, okay, colonial America was all on the East
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:32.240]  Coast and then people, Americans started moving West and they'd have small pockets of small
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.400]  communities. And then all of a sudden, millions of people came over and founded Chicago.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:49.680]  You know what I mean? And, you know, it, it, it's clearly the influx of recent, in the last month,
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:56.080]  massive influx. Surely I, it's gotta be the case that there are now more users on who've signed
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.240]  up for Mastodon in the last month than have signed up in the previous four years combined.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.640]  But it's those people who'd been using it for four years who established their own culture
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:11.280]  and these things like the content warnings. And I sympathize, you know, that if you were happy
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.960]  in September and October of this year with the way Mastodon was working for you as your quiet
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:22.000]  little space that is Twitter-like, but with your own community and these people and none of the
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:28.320]  nonsense that drove you away from Twitter. Or, you know, if you used, again, maybe you still
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:34.160]  kept your Twitter going, but also enjoyed using Mastodon separately, but embraced the differences
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:41.600]  culturally. I sympathize that all these Twitter people are coming over and are acting, you know,
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:48.480]  like yahoos. Yeah, like yahoos, right. Which is, you know, and I hate to say it because I am,
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:56.400]  I am, I am a proud American. I, even after all of this, I love this country and, you know, I'm,
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.560]  it's impossible for me to separate my personality from American culture, but it is a very
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.480]  American thing to do. I rec, I am self-aware enough of myself and America that that is a
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:12.800]  very American thing to do is to be new in town and start demanding that you conform to the norms
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.640]  from Twitter as opposed to the norms that you've happily established here. The content warning thing
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:24.800]  drives me nuts. I think it's crazy. Now, I would say the way to explain it, and it's, I guess
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.200]  Twitter, I guess clients have to use it. I mean, if they didn't, I don't, it's so culturally
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.960]  important. I don't know why they wouldn't. I mean, but you don't, it's not on by default.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.080]  Right. But the best, if you haven't used Mastodon, the best way to think about it is for spoilers,
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:46.480]  right? So if, if Mastodon had existed in 1981, you could go see the Empire Strikes Back,
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:51.200]  and then, and again, here, I'll use the verb I mentioned that we'd use it. Instead of tweets,
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:57.200]  they have toots. You can, although that's changed too. Oh, has it? Yeah. Cause apparently it was
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.280]  originally posts. And then toots came about because some YouTuber was talking about Mastodon
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:11.120]  and joked that if they changed it from posts to toots, that he would donate to the development.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.360]  And so they did, and he got, I don't know how much he donated, but.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.760]  Well, some of these YouTubers have a lot of money, so maybe.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:24.160]  Yeah, I know. Yeah. And then they recently you know, in the, I think in the 4.0 update for
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:30.480]  Mastodon, they set it back to posts, but a lot of the, I mean, you know, it's already in the culture
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.160]  and it's also in a lot of the third-party apps. So I don't know, I don't know if it'll ever go
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.320]  away completely, but it is not, it's not currently part of the official Ringo.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:45.840]  They use it, they, you know, as opposed to farting there, they treat it as like a trumpet,
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:51.200]  you know, tooting. Well, and you know, I think the, the main developer is European and I think
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:37:00.480]  the, the YouTuber was also not American. So that implication, that definite meaning was not intended.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.480]  Well, then I'll go back to posts. You could post on your Mastodon and coming right out of
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:11.360]  the Empire Strikes Back, you could post that, holy shit, Darth Vader is Luke's father. And then
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.480]  if you put the appropriate content warning that it's a spoiler on it, you would have,
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:24.240]  you'll anger nobody and break no norms and ruin the movie for no one. And only other,
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.800]  your people who follow you, who've also been in line to see it on day one could unfurl it.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:34.640]  And then they can write, you know, so spoilers would be the, the it's actually the best.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.240]  That's the, well, yeah, I mean, that's the, that's the use that I think everybody can.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:49.360]  I, I think that the culture around some, some, some communities on Mastodon of using those things
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.800]  for practically everything, practically everything. And I don't even understand some cases,
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.680]  at least with, like you said, like with talking about some people want anything of a discussion
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.120]  of racism behind a button, because it, it bothers you to see anything, think about it,
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.960]  to even think about it. I mean, I will say that, you know, I mean the years, 2016 to 2020,
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:20.000]  there were a lot of politics, things that I did not want to look at and being on Twitter
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.480]  was extremely stressful. And, you know, no matter how much I muted certain people and topics,
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:33.120]  you'd still end up seeing something that would bleed over in one way or another. And so I kind
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.760]  of, I mean, I get it to, I get it to a certain degree. Like I understand there are times,
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:43.600]  there are definitely times when I don't want to be, I mean, that's one of the nice things
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:51.440]  about being on Mastodon now is that it's not so angst ridden, I guess. It's a little bit more
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:58.240]  like Twitter used to be back, you know, before everything went to hell and a little bit more
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:03.760]  fun that way. So it's like, I kind of get it, but I also, I also do think like, oh my gosh,
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:10.240]  people are putting these things on, on like posts that are in no way controversial.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.320]  Right. I don't even get it. So I, and I just sort of feel like,
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.200]  I don't know. I don't think that's helping with their co with the culture of friendliness
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:26.240]  and avoiding angst. My opinion, if, if I become an active Mastodon user, I would, I can't foresee
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:33.280]  using that for anything other than spoilers for movies and stuff like that. And, and if anybody
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:39.120]  is bothered by the fact that I'll tweet or toot or post or whatever about things that you think I
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.640]  should put, use these content warnings for, then just don't follow. I mean, that's, and again,
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.800]  I'm not trying to be dismissive. I'm just like, I, I'm not getting into that. And I actually think
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.280]  that's the whole point of following somebody is I would like to hear and see what you do. And I
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.600]  don't want to have to tap on all these things. I find that I think that's a perfectly fine decision
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:03.120]  to make too. And, and, and, you know, I mean, I, I understand that a little bit more than I
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.280]  understand putting content warnings on literally everything, but if you also want to do that,
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.000]  that's fine too. Yeah. I, I, but I'm probably not going to follow you before we wrap up.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.280]  I should add that I do have, that is me on a Gruber at mastodon.social. I have not posted
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:26.080]  anything yet. I've favorited some I'm hesitant to become active. Like if I want to become active,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.920]  I want to, I want to know I'm there to stay. And I'm very uncertain that there's a thing,
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.840]  there's a feature, a couple of warnings, in my opinion, you can move from one instance to
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:43.680]  another, but it's, it's a lot like moving from, it's like, you can get a new email address. Your
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:50.480]  email doesn't come with you. So let's say, yeah, but your followers do. Yes. So you lose all your
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:54.320]  old, I mean, while you don't lose them, your old account will still be there. I mean, you can,
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:59.120]  I mean, I had, I've had more than one account and I moved from, I moved from mastodon.social to a
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:04.560]  different server. So everybody instantly who was following me on mastodon.social was following me
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.520]  on the new server and then that server shut down. So I moved back and they all came back,
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.320]  but I lost the posts in between because that server shut down. Right. So if, yeah, so you're
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:22.800]  at the Liberty of the server you're on existing in perpetuity for your, for your posts to exist
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:28.640]  in perpetuity. I'm not complaining about the fact that when, if I move to a different mastodon
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.240]  server, my account, I think what they've done is perfect for what they've designed that your
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.520]  followers move. So if there's a thousand people out there who follow me and I move to Gruber at
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.880]  mastodon.something else, and those thousand people just automatically still follow me after I flipped
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:53.360]  that switch, but my previous posts are still over on the old server. I get it that they can't move
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:59.840]  your posts with you because it would be a content moderation nightmare. Somebody is on an instance
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:09.680]  with a very liberal policy on whatever subject matter X subject matter X, and you've got 10,000
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:15.920]  posts about it. And then you move to an instance where X is either not allowed or is much more
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.440]  stringently moderated. You can't just, well, you could, but it's, it's a good design that
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:28.480]  your 10,000 existing posts don't move over. And, you know, and then there's the old adage from
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:35.680]  way back at the origin of the web, like 1991, you know, Tim Berners-Lee, that cool URLs don't change,
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.040]  you know, that your URL for your posts shouldn't change from one instance to another. But it just
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.080]  makes me hesitant to dive all in unless I'm really, really sure that mastodon.social or
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.520]  wherever else I might create an account is really where I want to stay.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.960]  Yeah. And I wish I was on a different, I wish I was on an instance that I felt more, I mean,
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.560]  I mean, I don't think this one's going to go anywhere, but I don't, you know,
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.960]  I don't feel like it represents me in any way. And I don't feel like I'm getting any benefit
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:08.640]  out of that. Right. It seems like a neutral server. It's it means, it means no more about
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:15.840]  who you are or what groups you're in than being on Twitter itself. I'm, you know,
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:22.320]  I guess I'm not as precious about my tweets. I mean, I have downloaded my Twitter. I downloaded
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:27.200]  my, I downloaded my Twitter history like a few years ago. And then all these people recently
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:31.280]  were like, Oh, I got a Russian, you know, make sure I get my, my archive, got to get my archive
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:37.680]  before you know, Musk burns the whole site to the ground. And I was like, I got it a couple of years
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:45.440]  ago. So I don't really like, I don't feel like I need the, the, the, the Delta between 2018 and
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.880]  today. Yeah, I don't know. I it's, it's breaking me down though. I might start
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:56.960]  to. Yeah. I mean, like I said, I mean, it's, it's, it's helped. It's, it's like going on
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:02.400]  methadone after, you know, an addiction. Like I, I it's helped me not be looking at Twitter
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:08.320]  all the time. Cause I, man, I've, I been on this, I've been on that site for 15 years and
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:15.520]  it really became part of my, part of my everyday experience. So part of your mental state every
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:22.960]  day. Yeah. Kinda for better, better and worse. And this has really made it much easier to go
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.280]  without it. So the last, I guess the last thing I'll say about it is maybe it's not the worst
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:35.120]  thing in the world that mastodon seems by design and then human nature destined to never to become
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:41.200]  a mainstream breakout. Maybe that's, yeah, it could be, maybe that's, you know, not the worst
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.920]  thing in the world that, that a lot of, you know, the things that I, that the fond memories I have
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:52.880]  of early Twitter are because it wasn't mainstream and mastodon has an upper ceiling on its mainstream
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:45:01.120]  appeal because of its conceptual complication of the being federated. Maybe that's not the
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.800]  worst thing in the world. And maybe that's sort of the secret to it and why, you know,
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:09.520]  at five years from now, we'll look back at this episode of the podcast and my
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.640]  hesitance to dive in will look foolish, you know, because, Hey, it's a lot better over there because
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:22.560]  our buddy, Albert McMurray, who lives, who I saw last night, he had a, he created a chart.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:28.000]  This was a long time ago even, but you know, it was a, it was a graph of number of Twitter users
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.560]  and it's, you know, it was a line that went, you know, slowly going up and then all of a sudden
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:38.160]  shot up at the end. And then he highlighted like the first, the first three years in there with,
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.880]  you know, where the line was very low and, and, and put a bar around and saying the good years.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.840]  So it is a little, I think it's a little bit like that. It's not exactly the same, of course, but
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.360]  I get that sort of vibe sometimes. All right. I'm going to take a break here and thank our
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:59.600]  third and final sponsor. Our good friends at collide. They spell it. K O L I D E collide.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.000]  If you're listening to this podcast, the talk show, the odds are very good that at some point
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:12.320]  your company is going to go through an audit like SOC two or ISO 27 zero zero one. And when you do,
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.320]  you'll have to answer some tough questions about end point security questions like,
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.960]  do all of your company's laptops have their disks encrypted? Does everyone have the company's
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:25.440]  password manager installed? Do you have a system in place to monitor and maintain compliance
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.800]  throughout your cross-platform fleet? Even if you're confident, the answer to all of those
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.680]  questions is yes. The bigger question when you're faced with one of these audits is,
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:41.440]  can you prove it to an auditor? If you're not quite sure how you'd go about proving compliance
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:46.640]  across your fleet of devices, then you need collide. Collide is an endpoint security tool
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:54.320]  for Mac windows and Linux devices that does things that MDMs can't do and gives you the visibility
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.280]  you need to achieve and maintain compliance. Best of all, collide does not resort to surveilling
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:05.200]  employees or locking down devices. It doesn't fight your employees. It helps them. Instead,
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:11.520]  it works with end users to resolve issues and relies on their cooperation and their informed
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:17.600]  consent. You can meet your security goals and you can pass and prove an audit without compromising
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:24.800]  on privacy. Visit collide.com slash the talk show to find out how. If you follow that link,

[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:44.800]  show. I bet we're back from the sponsor break, but I have one more mastodon quip. You mentioned
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.920]  the dearth of Mac native clients. There's a bunch of iOS apps that are in development and you have
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:55.200]  a bunch to choose from. It's actually so many. It's fun. It reminds me of the early days of
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:02.560]  Twitter where there's no consolidation in the third-party clients and there's a lot of good
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:09.760]  options. I hate to say it because I don't want to crap on anybody's existing apps, but there's no
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:15.680]  good Mac app. There's mastodon. Yeah, that seems like the best one. That's what I'm currently
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:23.680]  using. But it's missing a ton of features. It's so early days. These were probably just hobby
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:30.560]  side gigs for people who are developing them for fun for the most part, I guess. I don't know, but
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:40.160]  there was no urgency. There weren't that many users and now there's a lot and it's becoming
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:47.360]  a bigger deal. Yeah, but the die-hard Mac user in me is a little sad and it's nothing I'm not
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:54.080]  surprised by. I'm not saying native Mac development is dying, but it's still shrinking in my opinion
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:59.920]  and it's clearly being squeezed out by web apps. The answer is, well, wait, if there's no good Mac
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.960]  clients, what do people do on their desktop? They use the mastodon websites. They go to the web
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:12.480]  interface. It's like going to twitter.com on your browser instead of using an app and there's ways
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.800]  to turn the website into a standalone app. There's tools that let you do that so you can command tab
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:25.360]  to it instead of just fishing it out of your browser tabs. But I actually got this from you
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:32.240]  on mastodon today. The most interesting Mac client is a new one called Maxtodon
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:39.840]  and it looks really, really cool, but it's not going to be relevant to a lot of people because
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:48.960]  it's actually a Mac client for 68K. That's right. Classic Macs. In other words, System 6, System 7
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:58.880]  era 68K Motorola 68000 era Macs. This is not a joke. It is a real client. It warms my heart to
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:03.200]  see. Yeah. Oh yeah. It's great. I know. It's just, you know, the idea that somebody did that is
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.240]  fresh screenshots of the classic System 7 look with Geneva 9 all over the place.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.160]  So when the most interesting Mac client is written for Macs that came out
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:22.160]  32 years ago, it's, you know, you could kind of tell most people are using the website these days,
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:27.600]  but hats off to the Macs. I don't think any, I mean, I have several, you know, Macs that run
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.880]  old operating systems, but I don't think any of them are connected to the internet currently.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:42.240]  There was no reason to. What else? I had this on the agenda. It's brief, but talking about rumors
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:50.080]  of iPhone, future iPhones. There's a rumor that came out. Well, number one, there's this iPhone
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:55.680]  14 production hit. I guess this isn't a rumor. I mean, there's a really, really interesting
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:02.080]  protests going on all over China in reaction to their zero COVID policy and the lockdown,
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:09.680]  you know, that's the China, people in China are fed up and it's an unprecedented in decades
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:16.800]  amount of public protests in China about this. I linked to a couple of things yesterday,
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.240]  but one of the places that's been hit by this is Apple's Foxconn facility, you know, and people
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:31.280]  call it iPhone town, I think, or Apple town or something. But because of the Chinese government
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:37.040]  zero COVID policy when, you know, and COVID spreading around over there, they've locked down
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:43.200]  the campus and, you know, effectively turned the dormitories at the factories into a prison where
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.960]  you're, you know, not allowed to leave. And I don't think it's an exaggeration to describe it
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:54.160]  as a riot that, you know, riot broke out at one point a couple of days ago amongst the people who
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.360]  were employed there. People are upset. I don't, I honestly don't think that this is, there's
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.360]  nothing Apple can do about it. There's nothing Foxconn can do about it. It's the Chinese
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:10.000]  government's policy, but people are fed up. But the downwind effect of that for Apple
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.520]  is apparently that, you know, and apparently it's particularly the factory that is producing
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:23.440]  the iPhone 14 Pro models, Pro and Pro Max. And Bloomberg, Vlad Savov, who used previously worked
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:28.640]  at The Verge is now reporting for Bloomberg. I think he's stationed over in Asia judging by his
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:35.360]  Instagram. He's a great photographer too, but they're projecting, Bloomberg reported
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:42.560]  that it's going to be a 6 million unit shortfall for the quarter. And the quarter is obviously
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:46.480]  the most important one for Apple. The holiday quarter is when Apple sells the most iPhones
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:51.200]  by far, you know, that when you look at their quarterly results, there's, it's, you know,
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:58.080]  not quite as pronounced as back in the iPod era, but there's this, you know, cycle, cycle,
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:02.560]  then the holiday quarter is a big spike and then it goes down, down, you know, and it's not like
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:07.200]  they sell few iPhones the other nine months of the year, but this is when they sell the most.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.600]  Ming-Chi Kuo posted on Twitter about an hour ago and said that it's going to be more like 15 to
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:22.240]  20 million. Ooh, that's a big difference, right? And ballpark math, I mean, Apple famously no
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.160]  longer reports things like the average selling price for an iPhone, but if it's only the iPhone
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:34.320]  14 Pro models, I think a thousand dollars is a very fair average selling price considering,
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:40.240]  you know, it might even be a little conservative given the prices of the various capacities and
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:45.040]  the max and et cetera. But if you just did make the ballpark math easier, say it's a thousand
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:54.160]  dollars per iPhone, every million is a billion dollars of revenue. So 6 million shortfall is
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:01.600]  6 billion. And if Ming-Chi Kuo is correct, 10 or 15, that's 10 or $15 billion in sales.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:03.620]  Yeah.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:08.720]  You know, you and I are, I think, infamous for spending Tim Cook's money
[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:18.800]  during your appearances on this podcast. But, you know, you don't have to be, you know,
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:26.800]  a crypto genius to realize that we're talking about sums of money that definitely get Tim
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:33.920]  Cook's attention. This is not a rounding error. This is not their $50 million ad spend on Twitter
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:42.720]  or, you know, 10 to 15 billion. Wow. I mean, that is humongous. And I guess my question as a topic
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:52.240]  for discussion is how much of the bump, the spike for this quarter's iPhone sales year after year,
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.000]  how much is because this is the quarter when they're brand new and the enthusiasts are buying
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.320]  them because they're new? And how much is it the holiday gift buying? Because if it's just because
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:09.840]  they're new, I would think that all of those sales will get deferred until next, you know,
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:14.160]  the first quarter of next year. And, you know, just place the order now. And when it comes,
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:19.600]  it comes. But if it's for a holiday gift, I don't know. You know, I just checked.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.360]  If you miss Christmas, you miss Christmas.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.240]  Right. And I checked yesterday. And if you try to order a new 14 Pro on apple.com,
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:32.320]  the dates that they're promising is December 28th for just I didn't go through every color
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.400]  and every combination, but it seems pretty consistently December 28th, which is after
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:44.000]  Christmas, I think. I don't know. I'm such a procrastinator on gift buying that I'm not even
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.480]  sure, but I believe that that's too late. And I can't help but wonder if you're thinking like,
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.320]  you know, for, you know, your teenager or your spouse or whoever was thinking about getting an
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:02.880]  iPhone 14 Pro as a Christmas gift and you can't get it in time for Christmas. Number one, you
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:07.040]  might, but I wouldn't take the chance if it was the gift. Right. Because Apple famously under
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.880]  promises and over delivers on those shipping dates. So I'll bet even though it says December
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:16.720]  28th, if if I ordered one right now, I think there's a very good chance it would arrive
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.400]  before December 25th. But who can count on that? Yeah. For what? Again, we're talking about a
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:28.960]  thousand dollars or more. What's clearly going to be if it were going to be a holiday gift would be
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.600]  like the biggest gift, right? That's the big thing for so-and-so in the family this year. They're
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:40.000]  getting a new iPhone 14. Have you ever given given an iPhone for like for Christmas, I guess,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.200]  for or for like even a birthday? I don't like I think I've done it for Hank me. Yeah, I think we
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:51.120]  did. I think we did it for Jonas's first iPhone. Yeah, like like seven seven. Really? I don't
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:57.920]  directly recall that, but I'm certainly given in computers before, but right. It always seemed like
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:04.080]  a weird thing. It's always funny when Apple sends out their holiday like buying a gift guide or
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:11.600]  whatever. It's like get somebody a $2,000 laptop. Like you really overestimate what I spend on
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:18.800]  people. Same here. And you know, and same with about, you know, a thousand dollar phone. It seems
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:24.080]  like more of like a necessity thing to me that, you know, you have to buy in and you know, and
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:29.840]  since the cycle being what it is, it usually ends up being something we buy in September, October.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.440]  Yeah, but I don't know. There is that spike. So what explains it, you know, and
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.280]  you know, I guess I guess more people do it than and I could imagine personally, you know,
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:45.520]  if I were less of an enthusiast for the iPhone and idiotically buy buy one as soon as they go
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:51.040]  on sale every single year. But I could imagine that for me, I am no matter what, no matter which
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.680]  way the universe rolled out, there's no way that I was not going to be the difficult person to buy
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:01.520]  gifts for. I am very difficult to buy gifts for because there aren't many things I like. The things
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:09.280]  I care about, I'm extremely picky about. And when I want something, I just buy it. As soon as I want
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:14.080]  something for myself, I buy it. And so it's, you know, it's a constant source of why in the world
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.440]  did you buy that for yourself in November? You should have told me I could have got it for you
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.240]  for Christmas and I slapped myself. And I have patience. I just don't think that way, right?
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:27.280]  So I can imagine that as a difficult person to buy gifts for and I want a new iPhone, I can say,
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.320]  Oh, why don't you just get me a new iPhone for Christmas? That'd be great. And then, you know,
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:35.280]  I'd say, Oh, that's great, because it's $1,000. It, you know, done. Yeah, it'll be done. I don't
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:39.760]  have to worry about buying you a bunch of little things to add up to something. You could just get
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.080]  one nice present under the tree. And that would be great. So I think it's something like that. And
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.680]  so those still might get deferred because you want one anyway. And, you know, I would be the
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:55.040]  good spirit if it were me. And I would just say, you know, and my wife was like, Oh my God, I was
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:59.520]  going to get you told me to get you that iPhone for Christmas. I waited. I just checked. It says
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:04.400]  it's not coming till December 28th. Now I'm, you know, I bet you're the same way. I'm a good sport.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.040]  I would say, Oh my God, who cares? That's fine. Just put it on a card, put a card under the tree
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:15.040]  and I'll, you know, that's a picture of an iPhone. Yeah. No hard feelings. Don't even sweat it. It'll
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.400]  be fun. You know, it'll be something for me to open a couple of days after Christmas. I don't
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:23.280]  care. I'm not, you know, but if it's for a kid or something, I don't know. Right. Right. And again,
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:29.200]  when you're talking about the amount of iPhones Apple sells in this quarter, if it's a 5% hit,
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.680]  that's, that's serious. You know? Yeah. I mean, it's not going to tank the company, but no,
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:40.240]  but yeah, but it's, yeah. I mean, and it's not the thing about it, of course, is that it's not a,
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:44.080]  I mean, it's a, it's a headwind for them. Right. But it's not something that's fundamentally wrong
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:49.280]  with the company or the products. Well, except for the fact that the only thing that it points
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:53.440]  to for the company isn't about the quarter in particular, but that it shines a spotlight on
[01:59:53.440 --> 02:00:01.280]  their dependence on China. And we've all known that that could be problematic, right? It's,
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:08.240]  you know, there's the, of course, the, what if China invades Taiwan, right? And takes them by
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:15.440]  force and does a Russia Ukraine with Taiwan. That could, I mean, again, I don't think it would put
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:20.640]  Apple out of business, but it would, it would crater the company, right. In theory. And if,
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:28.160]  if the US in response did to China, what, and a lot of other companies, right. A lot of companies,
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:35.520]  right. It's it, it would, it would be, it would be in terms of the upheaval, it would cause
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:43.600]  American companies. It, it, it would dwarf the Russia Ukraine situation, right. And the biggest
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:52.560]  export from Russia is the gas and oil that Europe depends on American, you know, Americans haven't
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:57.280]  been filling their cars or their house, you know, household heaters with Russian gas and oil,
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.600]  but it's a big deal in Germany and other countries in Europe that the China would dwarf that even by
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.720]  the European standards in terms of how much of the world's manufactured goods come out of come
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:15.520]  through China in some way. But Apple is absolutely, you know, and the iPhone in particular is
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:21.520]  absolutely beholden to Chinese assembly and production. And I know they've expanded and they,
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:27.280]  you know, make some models in India and I know they are, they've got Foxconn plants in Brazil too,
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.880]  but they're just, you know, drop, drop in the bucket compared to China and however fast they're
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.520]  trying to broaden their dependence. And I know there's other products they've been making in
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:44.240]  Vietnam. I think a lot of AirPods maybe. Yeah, I think that that sounds right.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:49.040]  Go through Vietnam. So there, there must be, I mean, you know, I'm sure it's,
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:56.560]  it's very difficult, right? I mean, because the, that area of China is so specifically set up
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:05.200]  to do all of this stuff. Yeah. It's a, it's a dedicated business zone that does this for
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:11.600]  multiple companies, major companies, and that doesn't really exist other places,
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.600]  at least not yet anyway. And I'm sure it's really a difficult thing to
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:24.240]  try and not rely on that. And it must be because Tim Cook is normally, he's like the best operations
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.800]  guy in the world, and he hasn't been able to figure out a way out of this box.
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:37.200]  Right. Effectively though, the, the, the one big gamble in Tim Cook's tenure as CEO and going back
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:50.720]  to COO has been a bet that China will remain a dependable participant in the broader worldwide,
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:56.880]  I don't know what you would call it, the global alliance of, of countries that share certain
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:02.800]  values, you know, and participate in the global economy. Yeah. And invading Taiwan would violate
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:08.240]  that. I don't, I think China gets that. Yeah, I would think so too. But you would, I would have
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:13.520]  thought Russia would get it too. I mean, I'm, I'm less surprised by Russia invading Ukraine.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:19.600]  Yeah. Russia is, you know, I think China's political infrastructure is a little bit more,
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.840]  I mean, there is a, you know, a main guy at top, but it's not, it's not in the same
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:30.000]  degree as it is. Right. It's different in a lot of ways. And they have, China obviously has more
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.960]  to lose than Russia, but still. Russia's a little bit more like Twitter right now.
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:41.680]  Yeah. But you know, this whole thing with the COVID zero policy highlights that
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:49.520]  Xi is out of touch in some ways by, through his insulation, through the party infrastructure
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:55.040]  and their, you know, the, the, the stranglehold he, you know, he's, he's rewritten the laws
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:00.400]  of the country so that he, he, he's now starting a third term where it was previous, you know,
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:08.320]  he pulled a Michael Bloomberg, you know, and, and the, the culture there of not telling the
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:15.840]  boss bad news and letting bad news go up when lets them, you know, it, if he convinced himself
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:21.360]  and seemingly won't back down from obviously ill-conceived, we're not going to tolerate any
[02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:28.960]  outbreaks of COVID period. And, and now we, you know, see actual protests and riots breaking out
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:33.840]  across the country. You know, you wonder, you wonder what he's being told about what would
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:39.360]  happen if they took Taiwan by force. I don't know. It's obviously a bad, and that's, to me is where
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:45.120]  it might, again, I don't, you and I don't give stock advice, but you know, where I could see
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:50.000]  this hurting Apple longer term in terms of the stock, in terms of people's outlook, isn't the
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.480]  6 million or 10 to 15 million, wherever that number is, iPhone 14 pros in the last three months
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:03.520]  of 2022, it's just opening people's minds to the idea of, Hey, when, when something really bad
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:09.440]  happens in China, Apple is Apple, there's nothing Apple can do about it. So I thought that was
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:14.880]  interesting. I'm, I'm curious too. And, and I, you know, I don't know, you know, there, again,
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.840]  talking back to Apple's advertising strategy, they don't explain it. It's inscrutable, but I would
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:25.440]  expect that whatever they have flexibility on in terms of like TV commercials, I think are very,
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:29.440]  very flexible up to the last minute where they can, you know, if they previous, you know, they
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:36.320]  say, we want 30 seconds on this football game, they can give the network a new 32nd spot, you
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.760]  know, maybe not the last second, but you know, days in advance, billboards, you know, are harder,
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.920]  you know, you can't change billboards change on a regular schedule, but I'm curious, I'm going to
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:51.920]  try to pay attention to TV commercials and see if they shift to promoting the non-pro iPhone 14. And
[02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:56.880]  I know that they were going to advertise that anyway, even if everything was hunky dory,
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:03.440]  but I'm curious if they just shift all into promoting the non-pro 14, which apparently
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:09.520]  isn't affected, you know, just because they can sell it. Right. You know? Yeah. So here's that.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:16.000]  Well, and I think that was the, wasn't that the, the mix, they, I mean, they may have some leftover,
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  weren't the pros selling really well and the non-pros not selling so great to begin with?
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:26.560]  I don't know. I never, I take those, I take all of those things with a grain of salt because
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.680]  it doesn't seem to me like it's always seems to me with those numbers that the only people who
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:36.240]  really know, aren't going to tell it's like Tim Cook, you know, and there's, you know, Luca,
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:44.960]  Maisie, you know, and whoever else has access to their spreadsheets, but to do what else do we
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:49.600]  have? I, the only other thing I wanted to do is just to wrap up and circling back to Sofa,
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:56.160]  our first sponsor, but I have a couple of things I just to suggest to watch. And I know you watch
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:04.080]  a lot of TV. You said you do the, you do the Biff podcast. I want to recommend wholeheartedly,
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:12.880]  I have two shows now, but the first one is the peripheral on Amazon prime. Have you seen this?
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:17.200]  I have started it and I'm, I'm only a couple of episodes, two and a half episodes in,
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.920]  I think something like that. It's good. It's really good. I enjoy it quite a bit. I mean,
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.600]  I tried to read some of his work. It's what's his name? I can't,
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:29.520]  William Gibson and Gibson. Yeah. I tried to read some of his work back in the nineties and I found
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:34.320]  it like overly obtuse. Like I couldn't, it was so jargony and like, I was just like, Oh God,
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:40.960]  I think I tried to read Neuromancer. Right. I think that was the big one. I tried to read one
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:46.080]  of his books and it was just like, it was too much for me. And I put it down. This is a book that
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:51.200]  came out, like I think in 2013 that they're making based in the show off of, and it's much more
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:59.680]  approachable. It's not so much future jargony. I mean, it's, it's very relatable in terms of
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:03.840]  like look and feel for it. Like it looks like it could be just like five years from now.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:10.240]  Yeah. I'm exactly with you. I remember back in the nineties and I think I'm, I'm very,
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:15.200]  very sure that he either wrote one great feature article for Wired magazine or maybe even a couple.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:22.080]  Mm hmm. And I was like, man, I I've always had this guy's fiction on my list of things to try.
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:28.000]  I love his nonfiction for Wired. He's a great, obviously a great writer. And then I got one of
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.720]  his novels and sort of had the same experience of you where I was looking for like bubble gum to
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:39.200]  chew. And it's like, yeah, not that it's bad, but it wasn't, it wasn't easy and easy swallow. So I
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:46.320]  was like I think it translates very well to, to TV though, you know, and anyway, the gist of it
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:52.160]  fried up without spoiling anything. It is William Gibson-y in terms of future projections of
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:09:00.000]  technology and parts of it take place in the future. And it is from showrunners Jonathan
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.720]  Nolan and Lisa Joy, who did, if those names seem familiar to you, were the showrunners for West
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:13.760]  World, which I guess has been canceled down after the series. If I can't imagine how anybody who
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:20.800]  enjoyed West World, especially the first season or two, you would not enjoy this show. I would,
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.800]  I would think there's like, if not a hundred percent Venn diagram overlap, 99%. I can't
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:31.200]  imagine why somebody would enjoy West World and not enjoy this show. So if you liked West World,
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.840]  especially the first two seasons, I think you'll enjoy. I enjoy this more because it seems more
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.520]  cohesive. Yeah, I think I enjoy it more too. It's also a little less like, I only watched the first
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:47.600]  season of West World and I thought it was excellent, but it's also rough, right? It's real,
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:53.840]  it's real violent and dark. This is not, I mean, there's violence in it, but it's not as dark,
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.200]  I wouldn't say. I mean, it's, you know, it's dystopian for sure, but it's not like...
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.360]  It's less brutal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:06.080]  Yeah, and less disturbing, I guess. Yeah, it's a little more adventury than, you know.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:09.200]  Really good, great cast. Yeah.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.240]  Really, and the highest compliment I can pay for it, pay to it, is it was on my list. I started
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:19.440]  watching, I wasn't paying attention to how many episodes there are in a season. I got to episode
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:24.880]  seven a week ago and it was the last one and I was despondent. I was like, I can't wait for
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:29.680]  episode eight. Oh my God. And I still don't know how many, I guess there's 10 episodes,
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.680]  I don't know, but then episode eight came out over the weekend and I watched and I thought maybe this
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.320]  was the season finale, but it's not and I don't know what, I don't know if I was hoping it would
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:42.240]  be or not because now I don't know what to do again until Friday when another episode comes out.
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:47.520]  Excellent show. I really, really enjoy it and I think people who listen to the show will and
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:53.600]  I don't want to say anything more other than that it's just very compelling and interesting. And the
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:11:03.280]  last thing I'll say, has perhaps the best projection of future technology that I've seen in a long,
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.760]  long time in terms of feeling very real, like, oh, that could be exactly what it's like. And the way
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  that the characters interact with it is exactly realistic, which is that they are nonplussed,
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.160]  they're absolutely not amazed by their amazing technology at all.
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:25.360]  Yeah. And you were talking about actors and I don't know the guy's name, but the guy who
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:30.320]  plays her brother. So there's, is it Chloe Grace Smirtz is the main character and she's great,
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.040]  but like, and I was sort of like expecting the guy who plays her brother to just be sort of like,
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:40.640]  oh, he's, you know, they cast this pretty long kid. Yeah. Yeah. But, but he's really good. And
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.160]  I mean, and his part unfolds, I sort of thought that he was just going to be like background
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:51.760]  character, but his part has another layer to it that I won't discuss, but it's fun.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:59.600]  Yeah. And again, just perfect material for a 10-part show. I don't think it would have made
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:05.280]  for a good two-hour movie at all. I think it would have been so, it's just perfect for this.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:11.840]  And I think that's so true for novels, right? It's like the old Hitchcock used to supposedly
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.320]  never read novels or stopped reading them at some point early in his life, because he said that,
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:21.200]  I stopped reading novels because I can't stop thinking about turning them into movies,
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.200]  but they're terrible as movies because you have to cut so much. And what he did,
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.320]  he liked reading short stories because short stories translate to two-hour movie perfectly
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:36.400]  and you can pad them out. Anyway, great recommendation. Anything from you that you
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:43.360]  would like. I can't believe you haven't watched Andor yet. I'm kind of flabbergasted that you
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.720]  haven't gotten on that because that is, and you should, you should get on it as soon as possible
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:53.040]  because it is, I think it's absolutely fantastic. I'm skating on thin ice because I've been
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:02.720]  as near total media blackout on Andor as possible, but now that it's out and it's harder and harder.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:08.400]  And I'm not on, but it's not a series that's really like, it's like, there's not a lot of
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:14.080]  spoilers, right? You know, like Boba Fett's not showing up or anything. I mean, it's character
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:21.520]  driven. And so it's just, it's very good characters and great writing. And it just happens
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.080]  to take place in the Star Wars universe, really. Right. What I've heard about it is that it's the
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:31.760]  best Star Wars expanded universe thing hands down that they've made. And if you were turned off in
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.160]  any way by some of the other stuff, if you're like, ah, everybody's raving about this Mandalorian,
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:39.840]  but I don't love it. You still might really love it. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.280]  it's the most adult Star Wars property that they've, they've ever made. The only reason
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:50.480]  that I haven't watched it yet is I was saving it to watch with Jonas who's off at college.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.880]  And then he came home for Thanksgiving and spent the whole time with his high school friends.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:04.480]  Typical. Other than Thanksgiving day, you know, which isn't really the time to watch Star Wars.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:13.200]  So I'm saving it again for the Christmas break when I have been told, I have been told that
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:19.760]  there will be some time with Jonas in the house on the couch. He's probably seen it already.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:25.200]  He swears he hasn't. And he's an, he's an honest kid. So I believe him. He would tell me it would
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.680]  be the easiest thing in the world. Cause I'm, again, I, I'm, I'm the dad who's not going to,
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:33.280]  I'm not going to be heartbroken if he said, Hey, you know what? I was out with some friends and
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:37.840]  we watched Andorra. You should just go watch. I'm not going to be hurt, but you know, I'm also not
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:43.120]  going to be the one who he, if anybody breaks it, it's going to be him, not me. So I haven't,
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:47.440]  but it's certainly high on my list. Yeah. The other thing I'll toss out, we, Amy and I just
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:52.720]  watched all eight episodes in two nights and this is rare. I mean, Amy does not do that. She usually
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:59.760]  falls asleep. 1899, which is a new series on Netflix. Yeah. That's another one that I'm like,
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:05.840]  I'm an episode and a half into, but, but it's, it's good. It's gripping. It's it's nice and
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:10.720]  slow at the beginning too. There's a lot of, it takes its time. It doesn't really rush into
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:16.240]  whatever the heck is going on, which I don't even know yet. Yeah. Hey, I don't see how you could,
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:20.640]  but it's another one, but it is, it, it's, it, it reminds me a little of the peripheral and I think
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:28.320]  all of these sort of shows of the mysterious science fiction, a spooky, a spooky whole show.
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.120]  Yeah. I was good. I mentioned this on the, on the rebound the other days, but it was,
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.160]  and then Dan and Lex were like, what are you talking about? But there's this whole genre
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:44.320]  of shows that are spooky whole shows. They're like, yeah, what's the outer range is one. And
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:50.880]  then there's the, there's like a space one, some sort of space one on it's a JK Simmons and Sissy
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:55.200]  Spacek on, on Amazon prime. I can't remember the name of it. I don't remember that one either,
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:58.640]  but yeah, I only watched the first, like, I only saw like the first episode of that.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:05.440]  Snell gave me this one years ago. It's called Counterpart. It also has JK Simmons.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:10.400]  Oh yeah. So Counterpart, I'll toss this out there for anybody who wants to have their heartbroken
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:15.040]  and the heartbreak, the heartbreaking part is that it was clearly meant for multiple seasons,
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:20.000]  but it didn't get renewed. So there's only one season. And so there's two, there's two. Oh,
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.120]  well, yeah. There's two seasons. But it does. And, and it, and it has a, like, you can take the,
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:30.000]  the ending of season two as a wrap up if you, I mean, it works, but I do think that they meant
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.800]  to have more seasons. Yeah. All right. Well then there were two, but I, I gobbled it up so quickly.
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:39.280]  Yeah. Counterpart is it's great, but it's a spooky whole show. There's
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:47.280]  a spooky. Yeah. Yeah. It is a spooky whole show. Yeah. Should I spoil? I think I can
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:53.120]  spoil the premise of Counterpart. Yeah. I think, yeah. I mean, it comes out pretty quickly in the,
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:58.240]  in the show. Yeah. The premise of Counterpart is that at some point in the late 1960s,
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:04.160]  during the cold war, there was some kind of physics accident in, in Berlin.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:08.640]  Yeah. I think it's the eighties, but anyway. Oh, maybe the eighties, but decades ago. Yeah,
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:11.600]  maybe. Yeah. You're right. Probably the eighties, but it was during the cold war,
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:18.960]  some sort of physics experiment in Berlin went, went wrong. And there's an underground passageway
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:25.520]  in a government building in Berlin where if you walk through, you come out in Berlin, but it's,
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:30.960]  it's there's parallel universes. It's two. Yeah. Like the world divided into two. And so it's not
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:37.600]  a multiverse with infinite ones. It's just one fork into two universes, but anybody who was born
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:45.600]  before 1984 had therefore has a counterpart in the other universe. And you all have the same memories
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.720]  up until that point up until that lives diverge because the two universes go in different ways,
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:54.800]  you know, in one, it's a cold, it's a cold war story with another universe is what it is.
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.520]  Right. In one universe, you know, Dan Marino won a couple of super bowls, you know,
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.480]  and you know, and who knows what crazy, you know, butterfly flapping a wing in China repercussions
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:07.920]  of that happened, but it's a really interesting premise that was cut short,
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:13.600]  but that's a spooky whole show. I would say lost was a spooky whole show. Yeah, pretty much.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:17.520]  Yeah. Right. I mean, there is, there is the bunker, right? Right. The hatch was,
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:25.280]  was a spooky hole. 1899 has a little bit of lost to it and, you know, again, I'm not spoiling to
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:31.280]  it, but it's sort of like, I often feel like I loved lost for a couple of seasons and I loved it
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:37.760]  so much that it had, there was so much affection for the first season or two in my heart that I
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:42.640]  watched everything afterwards, even as I was like, Oh, this is not, yeah, this is not what it was.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.760]  Yeah. I think I just got, I got to the, I got to the point where it was,
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:49.760]  it seemed like they don't really have like a clear idea of where they're going.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:55.360]  No, no. So like, I thought they had this grand plan behind all of this and it's
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.800]  slowly becoming clear that they don't exactly know where they're going.
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:03.920]  I also kind of think that that's what happened to Westworld. In my opinion, it was kind of like,
[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:12.080]  we have this fabulous premise and we know we have a season one of plot and it's such a great premise
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:17.920]  and season one is such a great plot and we've, we've devised this interesting coterie of
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:23.280]  characters. Surely we'll figure out where it's going, you know, and then it doesn't.
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:28.240]  And so it seems like a huge cottage industry of these modern shows, like 1899 and a lot of these
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:33.840]  other ones are sort of like, what if we did lost, but we knew where it was going, right.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:40.320]  And I really do think, you know, a lot of times the way to get, you know, it's that stupid Malcolm
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:43.920]  Gladwell, 10,000 hours, you know, you practice, you know, I don't think there's anything magic
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:50.160]  about 10,000 hours, but practice makes perfect. And I think having made Westworld, but wanting
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:55.360]  to return to some of the same themes, but like, Hey, what if we maybe had a better idea of where
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:20:00.640]  it was going? And Oh my God, there's a novel that, you know, a great storyteller already figured out
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:07.280]  where it's going. It's better to me. I, I it's, you know, it's different. It's not like a reboot
[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:12.160]  of Westworld, but to me, I enjoy it more. And probably the problem with Game of Thrones, right?
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:18.480]  Oh yeah. The final chapter was not written by the genius who started the whole series.
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:21.920]  Right. They caught up to them. Yeah. Right. And then they're like, Oh,
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:24.000]  now what are we going to do? Well, let's change everything.
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.880]  Yeah. And let's come up with an ending that everybody dislikes.
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:33.920]  Did you ever watch dark? Cause that's the same people made dark make 1899.
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.560]  Oh, well then it's, I, it's supposed to be very good. I started it and it seemed like
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:44.800]  it was interesting. But it also seemed not to put too fine a point on it dark. And it came out,
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:51.200]  you know, during the presidency of someone I wasn't really fond of. So I was not able
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:53.680]  to keep watching it. Speaking of dark.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:57.760]  Reality was already dark enough for me. All right. Well, I'll put on a, you know,
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.640]  I'll give it a try now that Amy and I have run out of this one, but Amy, Amy is, was I,
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:09.040]  it really says a gazillion credits to 1899 that she never fell asleep and we watched four hours
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:14.320]  of it two nights in a row. That's pretty good. She thinks the fact that there's a lot of subtitles,
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:18.000]  there's characters who speak languages like German and other languages. And so there's a
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.560]  fair amount of subtitles. She thinks that helped. Yeah. Right. Cause you got to, you got to keep
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:26.160]  your eyes open. You got to keep your eyes open. You can't just close your eyes and I'll just
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:30.640]  listen for a couple minutes. Anyway, thanks for joining the show. Hope you had a good
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:37.440]  Thanksgiving break. I will thank our sponsors for the day. We had sofa where you can track
[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:43.040]  these shows that we mentioned and movies and books and anything else and square space where
[02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:49.360]  you can set up your own brand on a line and collide where you can manage a endpoint security
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:22:01.120]  for your whole company's fleet of Mac windows and Linux computers. Thanks, John. Thanks, John.
