[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  I actually got to say last week, good to see you.
[00:03.200 --> 00:06.480]  And now it's like what, every other month we see each other.
[00:06.480 --> 00:07.320]  It's back.
[00:07.320 --> 00:08.700]  Yeah, it's great.
[00:08.700 --> 00:10.120]  Hopefully we'll see each other in October
[00:10.120 --> 00:11.600]  at the next event.
[00:11.600 --> 00:14.320]  Being in person at that event was,
[00:14.320 --> 00:15.480]  I think Apple got a boost.
[00:15.480 --> 00:18.480]  I think all of us boosted our review scores
[00:18.480 --> 00:20.240]  because we were just happy to be together.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.300]  I think so too.
[00:21.300 --> 00:22.140]  What do you think?
[00:22.140 --> 00:25.080]  So before we, let's just skip over
[00:25.080 --> 00:30.080]  what is easily two hours of news if we talk real fast.
[00:30.400 --> 00:31.840]  And of course I don't talk fast
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.500]  and just speculate about the future.
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.900]  So Apple typically has an October event.
[00:35.900 --> 00:38.160]  Sometimes they'll postpone it to like early November.
[00:38.160 --> 00:40.460]  Everybody's expecting iPad Pros,
[00:40.460 --> 00:42.240]  which are overdue for a refresh
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.720]  and some sort of Mac hardware now that the M2 debuted
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.280]  with the MacBook Air at WWDC.
[00:49.280 --> 00:52.720]  Do you think, in times past they've held
[00:52.720 --> 00:55.440]  these October events all over the country?
[00:55.440 --> 00:57.800]  One time it was like at a Chicago Tech High School,
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.160]  Brooklyn Academy of Music a couple of years ago,
[01:00.160 --> 01:02.060]  which was a really fun show.
[01:02.060 --> 01:03.380]  Do you think they're gonna do something like that?
[01:03.380 --> 01:05.840]  Or you think with the COVID restrictions still in place,
[01:05.840 --> 01:08.840]  it is 100% certain we're going back to Cupertino?
[01:09.960 --> 01:11.320]  I think we're going back to Cupertino.
[01:11.320 --> 01:12.480]  I mean, I'm just assuming.
[01:12.480 --> 01:15.200]  Like one, it was great to be in the theater.
[01:15.200 --> 01:17.520]  They've started doing some additional security screening.
[01:17.520 --> 01:18.920]  I think you pointed out one of your posts,
[01:18.920 --> 01:21.080]  like it's just easier.
[01:21.080 --> 01:23.480]  And second, they haven't used that theater in like two years.
[01:23.480 --> 01:25.280]  I think they're just excited to be home.
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.120]  I do too.
[01:26.120 --> 01:28.700]  Well, and I also think that they're still,
[01:28.700 --> 01:30.740]  I mean, like one of the things, and I don't blame them.
[01:30.740 --> 01:31.940]  This is not a complaint.
[01:31.940 --> 01:35.320]  And I might've complained if they had required us
[01:35.320 --> 01:38.560]  to wear masks indoors for this event.
[01:38.560 --> 01:39.460]  In fact, I would have,
[01:39.460 --> 01:40.920]  because I think that would have been nonsense
[01:40.920 --> 01:42.600]  given the current state of COVID.
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.580]  But they didn't because I think they're on board,
[01:44.580 --> 01:48.560]  but they did require all attendees to provide a test score
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.160]  from the last 24 hours.
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.120]  So they're still worried enough about COVID
[01:52.120 --> 01:53.420]  that they're doing that.
[01:53.420 --> 01:56.480]  So I can't see why they would take the chance
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.800]  of planning an event off campus
[02:00.800 --> 02:04.400]  if they still think COVID is enough of a, hmm,
[02:04.400 --> 02:05.240]  you never know.
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.400]  And when COVID has gone bad with new waves,
[02:08.400 --> 02:10.400]  it goes bad quickly.
[02:10.400 --> 02:11.480]  Yeah.
[02:11.480 --> 02:13.860]  I appreciated that they're still doing the test results.
[02:13.860 --> 02:15.720]  Like that's what I need.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.640]  Like no one was wearing a mask,
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.880]  maybe like a handful of people.
[02:18.880 --> 02:20.880]  But I was like, you know what?
[02:20.880 --> 02:23.560]  I know that Apple has taken it seriously enough
[02:23.560 --> 02:25.400]  to require these test results.
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.200]  So like, I'm going for it.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.640]  Like I'm hugging everybody.
[02:28.640 --> 02:29.480]  Like that was great.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.480]  And I just appreciate it.
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.640]  Yeah, and they fixed the process from WWDC
[02:33.640 --> 02:34.960]  where everybody who attended
[02:34.960 --> 02:37.120]  also had to provide the test results where,
[02:37.120 --> 02:39.260]  but the website they're using it,
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.560]  I forget what the name of it is,
[02:40.560 --> 02:42.160]  but it's like a third-party provider
[02:42.160 --> 02:44.040]  where you take, it's just a home test.
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.760]  You don't need like one of the fancy go to a lab tests.
[02:46.760 --> 02:49.080]  You just take the type of test
[02:49.080 --> 02:51.880]  that the federal government sends everybody for free.
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.320]  And you take the test within 24 hours,
[02:54.320 --> 02:56.240]  take a picture of it and send it to them.
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.160]  My first thought was,
[02:57.160 --> 02:59.120]  well, how do you not just save a picture
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.600]  of a negative test and just send that?
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.600]  But there's QR codes on all the tests.
[03:03.600 --> 03:06.540]  So each test has like a unique identifier
[03:06.540 --> 03:09.320]  and the system can tell whether this one's ever been
[03:09.320 --> 03:11.720]  submitted to a system before, something like that.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.880]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[03:14.040 --> 03:14.880]  I had no idea.
[03:14.880 --> 03:15.720]  That's fascinating.
[03:15.720 --> 03:17.400]  Yeah, so there's something like that.
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.920]  And at WWDC, the system kind of fell apart
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.920]  where it was like I couldn't submit it from my Mac.
[03:26.800 --> 03:29.000]  And then I tried the next morning,
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.680]  the morning of the WWDC keynote with the same test result
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.380]  from my phone with the same picture and it worked,
[03:36.380 --> 03:37.760]  but it didn't go green.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.020]  It went yellow instead.
[03:39.020 --> 03:41.000]  It was like red means you haven't submitted a test
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.760]  and green is that you're good.
[03:42.760 --> 03:43.760]  And mine went yellow.
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.600]  And I was like, well, I'm sure it will work out.
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.800]  And then by the time I got to the check-in,
[03:47.800 --> 03:49.320]  they were like, yeah, yeah, you're good.
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.280]  So yeah, I'm glad they're doing the test thing too.
[03:52.280 --> 03:54.700]  That's a good thing.
[03:54.700 --> 03:57.560]  I think it's the appropriate precaution for this level.
[03:57.560 --> 03:58.400]  You're right.
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.240]  If it goes bad, it goes bad fast
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.320]  and you gotta do all sorts of other stuff,
[04:00.320 --> 04:02.240]  but it felt appropriate.
[04:02.240 --> 04:06.240]  It also felt like everyone was just happy to be at work.
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.740]  I mean, like fundamentally,
[04:07.740 --> 04:09.840]  everyone in that building is at work.
[04:09.840 --> 04:12.000]  Like we're working, we're trying to cover it,
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.680]  they're working, they're trying to guide our coverage,
[04:14.680 --> 04:17.200]  but like being able to work together is a delight.
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.560]  And I thought that was great.
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.240]  It was funny with the security screening
[04:20.240 --> 04:22.580]  because I came in with Joanna and Panzerino
[04:22.580 --> 04:25.440]  and Joanna was really happy to see the security.
[04:25.440 --> 04:27.280]  And I had to agree with her that,
[04:27.280 --> 04:29.320]  and I kind of put it in my coverage of the event
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.560]  that it wasn't so much that the security
[04:31.560 --> 04:33.400]  felt like an increased annoyance.
[04:33.400 --> 04:35.400]  It actually sort of felt like, hey,
[04:35.400 --> 04:37.200]  it's kind of weird that for all these years,
[04:37.200 --> 04:40.040]  we were coming to these super high profile events
[04:40.040 --> 04:42.900]  and they just kind of waved everybody in
[04:42.900 --> 04:44.620]  after checking our IDs.
[04:45.720 --> 04:48.960]  But of course I get pulled for additional screening
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.040]  and Joanna's off to the side telling them
[04:51.040 --> 04:53.040]  to look out for me, I'm dangerous.
[04:53.040 --> 04:56.120]  All the jokes you can't say at the TSA,
[04:56.120 --> 04:58.240]  you can say at the Apple security checkpoint.
[04:58.240 --> 04:59.080]  Exactly.
[04:59.080 --> 04:59.920]  That's great.
[04:59.920 --> 05:01.000]  She's like, you better scan him twice,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  he's always hiding stuff in his pants.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.680]  That's great, that's super funny.
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.640]  What did you think, and this is the rare question
[05:09.640 --> 05:12.240]  I ask on this show where I know a bit of the answer
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.000]  because we talked in person, but what did you think
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.240]  about the fact that the actual keynote
[05:18.240 --> 05:20.840]  was entirely pre-recorded, even though we were
[05:20.840 --> 05:23.100]  all together in the theater on the stage?
[05:24.120 --> 05:25.720]  I didn't love it.
[05:25.720 --> 05:27.020]  I mean, I liked being in the theater.
[05:27.020 --> 05:28.560]  I think you called out their screen.
[05:28.560 --> 05:30.800]  That screen, by the way, is entirely new
[05:30.800 --> 05:32.360]  since the last time we were in that theater.
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.360]  It used to be a projector and now it's a micro LED.
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.680]  I asked, of course I asked about it.
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.840]  It's a micro LED screen, it's like the industry
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.960]  leading micro LEDs, or mini LED, whichever one it is.
[05:41.960 --> 05:44.000]  And so it's all new, it's completely shiny,
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.260]  they've got the big Atmos system.
[05:45.260 --> 05:47.700]  So that was all awesome and cool.
[05:47.700 --> 05:51.400]  And then to watch a movie that is actually hard to cover
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.740]  because the pacing is so fast.
[05:54.740 --> 05:56.360]  So we live vlogged these things
[05:56.360 --> 05:58.000]  and the pacing was insanely fast.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.720]  It's like, I've gotten to be a better, faster typist
[06:01.720 --> 06:04.400]  in the past two years or so, just by covering
[06:04.400 --> 06:05.760]  these things at the speed.
[06:05.760 --> 06:07.660]  And not having any of the,
[06:07.660 --> 06:12.660]  like it just didn't, the anticipation doesn't build.
[06:13.300 --> 06:16.280]  Because you kind of know how it's going to go, right?
[06:16.280 --> 06:17.780]  They're going to show you a video,
[06:17.780 --> 06:20.180]  you're going to swoop around the Apple campus.
[06:20.180 --> 06:22.700]  The person who's inevitably going to,
[06:22.700 --> 06:24.660]  Dan Riccio's going to show you the Mac.
[06:24.660 --> 06:26.740]  Like, you just know all these characters in this way
[06:26.740 --> 06:29.180]  and you kind of know the structure of them now
[06:29.180 --> 06:32.220]  because they're movies and they've fallen into a,
[06:32.220 --> 06:34.820]  just like any good movie falls into a structure.
[06:34.820 --> 06:35.820]  They've fallen into a structure.
[06:35.820 --> 06:38.420]  Whereas I think the live events had a little bit more
[06:38.420 --> 06:41.120]  adrenaline, a little bit more chaos,
[06:41.120 --> 06:43.720]  a little bit more surprise to them.
[06:43.720 --> 06:45.920]  I don't think that they're the point.
[06:45.920 --> 06:48.820]  Like, I could just watch the keynote in my hotel room
[06:48.820 --> 06:50.580]  and go to Apple Park and get what I need
[06:50.580 --> 06:51.980]  out of the visit to Apple Park,
[06:51.980 --> 06:54.500]  which is talking to people and holding the things
[06:54.500 --> 06:55.540]  and going to briefings.
[06:55.540 --> 06:57.600]  Like, that's the important part.
[06:57.600 --> 06:59.580]  But if you're going to put us in the theater,
[07:00.580 --> 07:03.220]  I would prefer a live show.
[07:03.220 --> 07:06.100]  I think I would personally, but I also think
[07:06.100 --> 07:07.580]  they've made the right choice.
[07:07.580 --> 07:12.100]  Like, if I were on the team there making the decision,
[07:12.100 --> 07:14.020]  it's like I see the trade-offs.
[07:14.020 --> 07:16.740]  I think for them, they're making the right choice.
[07:16.740 --> 07:18.620]  But we are the ones who suffer.
[07:18.620 --> 07:21.020]  And thematically, we could tie this in later,
[07:21.020 --> 07:24.380]  it is sort of like the decision to go eSIM only
[07:24.380 --> 07:27.380]  on the iPhones, where you know who suffers the most?
[07:27.380 --> 07:29.140]  People like me and you.
[07:29.140 --> 07:31.020]  Because we're the ones who are trying to,
[07:31.020 --> 07:33.380]  I mean, literally just this week, it would have been nicer.
[07:33.380 --> 07:37.100]  I've got three iPhones in my possession, new ones to test.
[07:37.100 --> 07:39.580]  It really would be nice to go back to the old way
[07:39.580 --> 07:42.100]  of just 30 seconds with a paperclip
[07:42.100 --> 07:44.300]  and my SIM is in a different iPhone.
[07:44.300 --> 07:45.180]  And it's the same way.
[07:45.180 --> 07:47.460]  I think that the experience for the media
[07:47.460 --> 07:50.220]  in the Steve Jobs Theater is worse,
[07:50.220 --> 07:52.020]  because it's less drama.
[07:52.020 --> 07:54.300]  It was always better to have the drama.
[07:54.300 --> 07:56.500]  The pace, the faster pace is so much better
[07:56.500 --> 07:57.380]  for the people at home.
[07:57.380 --> 07:58.680]  It's more of a show.
[07:58.680 --> 08:02.080]  But for us taking notes, the faster pace is worse.
[08:02.080 --> 08:05.580]  And when we were home the last two years
[08:05.580 --> 08:08.640]  watching these like everybody else at home,
[08:08.640 --> 08:10.940]  what did we do as soon as the keynote was over?
[08:10.940 --> 08:14.340]  I would rewind a bit and go back to the parts
[08:14.340 --> 08:16.340]  where I felt like maybe it went too fast.
[08:16.340 --> 08:19.240]  Whereas last week, what did we do
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.520]  after the keynote was over?
[08:20.520 --> 08:24.120]  We're immediately flushed into the hands-on area
[08:24.120 --> 08:26.260]  and the pace is still super fast.
[08:26.260 --> 08:28.180]  Because it's like, how do I get my hands on all this stuff?
[08:28.180 --> 08:29.020]  How do I see this?
[08:29.020 --> 08:30.400]  Oh, there's somebody to talk to.
[08:30.400 --> 08:31.380]  I want to talk to them.
[08:31.380 --> 08:34.460]  And you don't get to catch up and go back
[08:34.460 --> 08:38.920]  to what flew by in the keynote until hours later.
[08:39.940 --> 08:43.640]  Yeah, I agree with you that on balance,
[08:43.640 --> 08:45.060]  the audience is bigger on the internet
[08:45.060 --> 08:46.080]  than can fit in that room.
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.900]  That room was too small when they built it,
[08:47.900 --> 08:49.060]  because their events have just been getting
[08:49.060 --> 08:50.620]  bigger and bigger.
[08:50.620 --> 08:52.580]  The whole campus is too small.
[08:52.580 --> 08:56.300]  Honestly, it was like they made this giant spaceship ring.
[08:56.300 --> 08:58.620]  And famously, it was one of the last things
[08:58.620 --> 09:00.020]  Steve Jobs was involved with.
[09:00.020 --> 09:01.420]  He's the one who made the presentation
[09:01.420 --> 09:03.240]  to the Cupertino town hall.
[09:03.240 --> 09:04.780]  And it sounded humongous.
[09:04.780 --> 09:06.860]  And by the time it was finished,
[09:06.860 --> 09:11.780]  Apple's headcount had exploded past where it was in 2011.
[09:11.780 --> 09:13.700]  I think if they could have replanned it,
[09:13.700 --> 09:15.700]  the spaceship would have been even bigger.
[09:15.700 --> 09:19.020]  It's huge, just to be clear.
[09:19.020 --> 09:21.420]  And it's also in the middle of the neighborhood.
[09:21.420 --> 09:24.280]  It's just truly one of the stranger experiences
[09:24.280 --> 09:25.120]  you have driving up to it.
[09:25.120 --> 09:27.140]  Yeah, but the theater,
[09:27.140 --> 09:29.360]  I remember the first time I walked into it,
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.740]  someone said, it's already too small for what we want to do.
[09:33.740 --> 09:36.620]  So I think they know their audience is bigger outside.
[09:36.620 --> 09:39.560]  But the value for me going in person
[09:39.560 --> 09:41.780]  is seeing you and gossiping with you for five minutes
[09:41.780 --> 09:44.220]  and then talking to the executives
[09:44.220 --> 09:47.180]  and being able to hold the product immediately
[09:47.180 --> 09:49.760]  after it's announced is completely underrated.
[09:49.760 --> 09:50.820]  Nothing on the internet
[09:50.820 --> 09:52.700]  looks like it does in person, in my opinion.
[09:52.700 --> 09:55.460]  Yeah, that's so true.
[09:55.460 --> 09:57.460]  No, the colors are the main thing.
[09:57.460 --> 09:58.640]  One of the main things I missed,
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.260]  it's talking to people face-to-face
[10:00.260 --> 10:01.980]  is number one, the biggest thing.
[10:01.980 --> 10:05.740]  Whether it's friendlies like you and Joanna and Pansarina
[10:05.740 --> 10:07.700]  or Apple people, right?
[10:07.700 --> 10:11.180]  And getting off the record three, four minutes
[10:11.180 --> 10:15.660]  with Phil Schiller or Alan Dye or whoever else
[10:15.660 --> 10:17.180]  and other people whose names,
[10:17.180 --> 10:19.860]  people I know whose names listeners might not know.
[10:19.860 --> 10:21.500]  But just getting little bits like that,
[10:21.500 --> 10:24.180]  you cannot get that without the face-to-face.
[10:24.180 --> 10:27.140]  Yeah, there's just an element of
[10:27.140 --> 10:31.320]  you ask different questions on Zoom briefings
[10:31.320 --> 10:32.740]  than you would in person.
[10:32.740 --> 10:35.580]  It's just like the stakes of every remote conversation
[10:35.580 --> 10:37.100]  seem higher to me.
[10:37.100 --> 10:40.620]  So in person, I was like, really, Dynamic Island?
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.460]  Like, tell me about this.
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.020]  And then on a Zoom call or whatever,
[10:43.020 --> 10:44.940]  it's like a very formal question.
[10:44.940 --> 10:49.180]  And you do a different kind of journalism in person,
[10:49.180 --> 10:50.060]  so I appreciate that.
[10:50.060 --> 10:51.860]  Yeah, I'm trying to think, what else?
[10:51.860 --> 10:54.940]  Oh, yeah, I was gonna say the second thing that I miss
[10:54.940 --> 10:58.020]  other than face-to-face is seeing the color of things
[10:58.020 --> 10:58.900]  in person.
[10:58.900 --> 11:02.620]  I would almost say two extremes, right?
[11:02.620 --> 11:05.260]  Where with the Apple Watch Ultra,
[11:05.260 --> 11:08.180]  to see the orange, which I really love,
[11:08.180 --> 11:09.820]  orange is one of my favorite colors,
[11:09.820 --> 11:12.260]  and I think that they really nailed it.
[11:12.260 --> 11:15.500]  I think it is just the perfect orange for this.
[11:15.500 --> 11:18.820]  And then with the iPhone's 14 Pro,
[11:18.820 --> 11:20.100]  they all still look gray.
[11:21.140 --> 11:25.180]  Even in their perfectly lit hands-on area,
[11:25.180 --> 11:27.540]  to my eyes, you could see, like, deep purple's purple.
[11:27.540 --> 11:29.420]  But when I tried to take a photo of it,
[11:29.420 --> 11:33.100]  the camera kept, my 13 Pro kept white balancing
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.060]  to make it gray.
[11:35.580 --> 11:37.260]  That's fascinating.
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.820]  At WWC, I had all but forgotten how to use my camera.
[11:39.820 --> 11:42.180]  Like, I was there with David Pierce,
[11:42.180 --> 11:43.420]  and we're like, oh, we are rusty.
[11:43.420 --> 11:44.740]  We have no idea what we're doing.
[11:44.740 --> 11:47.300]  We haven't used these things under pressure in two years.
[11:47.300 --> 11:49.340]  So we were a little bit better this time.
[11:49.340 --> 11:50.780]  But yeah, it's hard.
[11:50.780 --> 11:53.140]  Apple's lighting is basically perfect.
[11:53.140 --> 11:54.740]  It's hard to complain about.
[11:54.740 --> 11:59.740]  But it's still capturing what your eyes see as color,
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.380]  and what the cameras, it's a forever challenge.
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.340]  It's actually one of my favorite
[12:04.340 --> 12:06.500]  sort of live tech journalism challenges,
[12:06.500 --> 12:11.500]  is getting a good photo under pressure is fun.
[12:11.820 --> 12:13.060]  I enjoy that piece of it.
[12:13.060 --> 12:18.060]  I am, luckily, I mean, it's both by design and by talent.
[12:18.820 --> 12:22.120]  Don't really publish live photos from the event.
[12:22.120 --> 12:23.520]  I love taking photos.
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.380]  I'm an avid, and I have always been
[12:25.380 --> 12:27.660]  avid prosumer photographer.
[12:27.660 --> 12:30.420]  But there's a reason I'm not a professional photographer.
[12:30.420 --> 12:31.860]  I don't really have a talent for it.
[12:31.860 --> 12:33.540]  And I'm blown away.
[12:33.540 --> 12:37.440]  I try to take photos as though I might publish them.
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.560]  And I see other people's photos of the exact same thing
[12:41.560 --> 12:44.420]  in the exact same hands-on area that I was trying to take,
[12:44.420 --> 12:47.620]  and theirs look great and are really cleverly framed,
[12:47.620 --> 12:49.760]  and mine look like somebody's shoulder
[12:49.760 --> 12:50.860]  is standing in front of me.
[12:50.860 --> 12:54.420]  One of my all-time favorite moments
[12:54.420 --> 12:56.580]  from a decade of doing this now,
[12:56.580 --> 12:58.060]  which is an incredible thing to say,
[12:58.060 --> 13:02.540]  is when the Palm Pre was announced at CES way back when.
[13:02.540 --> 13:07.540]  This is like pre-LTE era, and the Wi-Fi was bad at CES.
[13:07.540 --> 13:10.580]  And so I was in the trailer we had at CES
[13:10.580 --> 13:14.220]  out in the parking lot, and Paul Miller sprinted
[13:14.220 --> 13:17.700]  from the hall to our trailer after having taken photos.
[13:17.700 --> 13:18.740]  And he entered the trailer,
[13:18.740 --> 13:22.580]  and he held his SD card aloft in victory.
[13:22.580 --> 13:23.920]  And we published the photos first
[13:23.920 --> 13:25.700]  because he had sprinted back to our trailer
[13:25.700 --> 13:28.180]  that had a hard connection with his SD card.
[13:28.180 --> 13:29.580]  And that's what I mean.
[13:29.580 --> 13:30.740]  That's the fun.
[13:30.740 --> 13:33.200]  There's a competitive element to doing it.
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.860]  Now, do I take photos nearly as good
[13:35.860 --> 13:37.260]  as half of the YouTubers out there?
[13:37.260 --> 13:38.380]  No, I do not.
[13:38.380 --> 13:41.220]  But every day is an incremental improvement.
[13:41.220 --> 13:44.060]  I also continue to be blown away by the footage
[13:44.060 --> 13:48.780]  that the really good YouTubers like Marques and Justine
[13:48.780 --> 13:52.860]  get out of that hands-on scrum, because it's chaos.
[13:52.860 --> 13:55.100]  It is pure chaos.
[13:55.100 --> 13:57.220]  And then you watch their videos afterwards.
[13:57.220 --> 14:00.220]  And yeah, they shoot lots of B-roll afterwards.
[14:00.220 --> 14:02.580]  They get some time when everybody's been cleared out,
[14:02.580 --> 14:03.760]  and they can set up.
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.000]  But they have lots of footage
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.540]  that they've taken during the scrum.
[14:07.540 --> 14:09.180]  And it's so good.
[14:09.180 --> 14:10.420]  Yeah, it's good.
[14:10.420 --> 14:11.740]  They have a secret.
[14:11.740 --> 14:13.380]  We have been watching them for years,
[14:13.380 --> 14:15.380]  because our video team is competitive with them, too.
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.460]  They wait.
[14:16.460 --> 14:17.860]  Yep.
[14:17.860 --> 14:19.660]  They're just more patient than we are.
[14:19.660 --> 14:22.940]  And all things, a little more time,
[14:22.940 --> 14:24.380]  is like a 10x improvement.
[14:24.380 --> 14:25.500]  Yep, yep.
[14:25.500 --> 14:27.920]  Yeah, and that's one thing that hasn't changed,
[14:27.920 --> 14:30.700]  is the need to publish.
[14:30.700 --> 14:32.980]  And that initial scrum lasts,
[14:32.980 --> 14:35.260]  and then everybody files out.
[14:35.260 --> 14:38.580]  And that's my secret, too, is in the immediate aftermath
[14:38.580 --> 14:41.060]  of the keynote, go look for people to talk to.
[14:41.060 --> 14:44.500]  Don't try to get near the products, because it's chaos.
[14:44.500 --> 14:45.980]  And you just wait half an hour,
[14:45.980 --> 14:47.220]  and then all of a sudden it's not that hard
[14:47.220 --> 14:49.100]  to get near any of the products.
[14:49.100 --> 14:50.180]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[14:50.180 --> 14:52.720]  It's like, oh, there's a secret to success here,
[14:52.720 --> 14:56.060]  and it's waiting for my impatient ass
[14:56.060 --> 14:58.340]  to get out of the way.
[14:58.340 --> 14:59.180]  All right, let me take a break here.
[14:59.180 --> 15:01.660]  I think our first sponsors are good friends at,
[15:01.660 --> 15:04.260]  and quite frankly, they're fueling this podcast,
[15:04.260 --> 15:05.600]  Trade Coffee.
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.940]  Look, it is crazy that so many of us enjoy
[15:07.940 --> 15:09.660]  the finer things in life, and so many of us
[15:09.660 --> 15:12.300]  still settle for blah, coffee every day.
[15:12.300 --> 15:15.720]  With Trade Coffee, you can start every morning
[15:15.720 --> 15:17.100]  with something special.
[15:17.100 --> 15:20.160]  I drink, well, I don't drink a lot of coffee all day.
[15:20.160 --> 15:22.200]  I make a big pot of coffee in the morning,
[15:22.200 --> 15:23.220]  and that's my coffee.
[15:23.220 --> 15:25.780]  Because if I drink more coffee later in the day,
[15:25.780 --> 15:28.120]  then it screws me up pretty bad.
[15:28.120 --> 15:30.580]  But one big whole pot of coffee in the morning,
[15:30.580 --> 15:32.460]  man, that's my breakfast.
[15:32.460 --> 15:35.600]  And look, I can't think of a better way to start.
[15:35.600 --> 15:38.100]  It really, it gets me out of bed in the morning
[15:38.100 --> 15:40.180]  thinking, you know what, I'm gonna get up,
[15:40.180 --> 15:42.260]  I got something to write, I got something to read,
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.820]  something I'm excited about,
[15:43.820 --> 15:46.400]  and I'm gonna have some delicious coffee to get started.
[15:46.400 --> 15:47.760]  The thing to know about coffee,
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.880]  I emphasize this every time I talk about trade,
[15:49.880 --> 15:51.500]  is coffee is produce.
[15:51.500 --> 15:54.080]  Even though it's been roasted, it goes bad.
[15:54.080 --> 15:55.260]  It's a perishable good.
[15:55.260 --> 15:56.820]  What you want is fresh coffee,
[15:56.820 --> 15:59.500]  and anything sitting on a shelf, like in a supermarket,
[15:59.500 --> 16:01.060]  no matter how cool the brand is,
[16:01.060 --> 16:03.060]  might have started off as excellent coffee.
[16:03.060 --> 16:05.300]  But by the time it's sitting there on the shelf,
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.380]  it's already going bad.
[16:06.380 --> 16:08.100]  It's losing the flavor.
[16:08.100 --> 16:11.180]  When you subscribe to trade coffee,
[16:11.180 --> 16:14.180]  you get fresh coffee mailed directly from roasters
[16:14.180 --> 16:17.080]  all over the country, sent fresh to you.
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.800]  It is just days old by the time it gets to you,
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.480]  and it is so fresh.
[16:21.480 --> 16:23.500]  And it's just the easiest way.
[16:23.500 --> 16:24.820]  And then you never have to go shopping.
[16:24.820 --> 16:25.880]  God, I hate going shopping.
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.180]  And even worse than that, I hate running out of coffee.
[16:29.180 --> 16:30.460]  Well, I never run out of coffee
[16:30.460 --> 16:31.720]  because I've got a subscription.
[16:31.720 --> 16:35.320]  So what you do is you sign up at trade.
[16:35.320 --> 16:36.540]  They give you a quiz.
[16:36.540 --> 16:38.820]  The quiz asks you what type of coffee you like.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.700]  They get you started.
[16:39.700 --> 16:42.180]  You say how much you want to get to it.
[16:42.180 --> 16:44.200]  Once a week, once every other week.
[16:44.200 --> 16:45.860]  They're so flexible, it's crazy.
[16:45.860 --> 16:47.260]  And then once you have the subscription,
[16:47.260 --> 16:48.700]  you can pause it.
[16:48.700 --> 16:51.720]  If you're going away, you can change it at any time.
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.620]  If you're like, you know what?
[16:52.620 --> 16:53.920]  Once a week is too much for me.
[16:53.920 --> 16:55.300]  I should go like every 10 days,
[16:55.300 --> 16:57.420]  or I should go every 14 days, or something like that.
[16:57.420 --> 16:59.020]  You can change it at any time.
[16:59.020 --> 17:01.620]  And as you're getting their coffee,
[17:01.620 --> 17:03.300]  you can rate it if you want.
[17:03.300 --> 17:04.640]  You can ignore it otherwise
[17:04.640 --> 17:06.640]  and just let them keep sending what they send you.
[17:06.640 --> 17:09.180]  But you can rate it and they'll use your ratings
[17:09.180 --> 17:11.980]  to dial in which other coffees you might like
[17:11.980 --> 17:13.180]  and send you that stuff.
[17:13.180 --> 17:14.600]  And I got to say, it really works.
[17:14.600 --> 17:16.420]  The longer I've been subscribed to trade,
[17:16.420 --> 17:19.300]  the more I'm liking the coffee they're sending me.
[17:19.300 --> 17:21.380]  So if you want to support small businesses,
[17:21.380 --> 17:24.540]  because again, they source the beans from small roasters
[17:24.540 --> 17:27.580]  all over the country and brew the best cup of coffee
[17:27.580 --> 17:28.420]  you've ever made at home.
[17:28.420 --> 17:29.900]  It's time to try Trade Coffee.
[17:29.900 --> 17:32.620]  Right now, Trade is offering talk show listeners
[17:32.620 --> 17:35.060]  a total of 30 bucks off your first order,
[17:35.060 --> 17:39.900]  plus free shipping at drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[17:39.900 --> 17:44.660]  That's drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[17:44.660 --> 17:46.940]  And you get 30 bucks off your subscription
[17:46.940 --> 17:48.700]  to the best coffees in the country.
[17:49.620 --> 17:53.260]  Let's talk the stuff that was actually announced, right?
[17:53.260 --> 17:54.100]  Yeah.
[17:54.100 --> 17:57.300]  iPhone 14s, the reviews all dropped.
[17:57.300 --> 18:00.040]  Well, most of them dropped on Wednesday.
[18:02.800 --> 18:05.860]  Yeah, to make it clear, I'm on the show
[18:05.860 --> 18:08.100]  because I texted John and said, where's your review?
[18:08.100 --> 18:10.220]  No, you said, are you reviewing the phone?
[18:10.220 --> 18:11.060]  Yeah.
[18:12.260 --> 18:13.580]  Yeah, did you just quit this year?
[18:13.580 --> 18:14.420]  Are you just out?
[18:17.620 --> 18:18.780]  I had nothing to say.
[18:20.460 --> 18:23.780]  I'm looking at it now, it's like 20,000 words.
[18:23.780 --> 18:25.960]  It's actually longer than usual.
[18:25.960 --> 18:28.220]  I knew it was gonna be longer than usual.
[18:28.220 --> 18:32.340]  And there's a couple of, number one,
[18:32.340 --> 18:35.080]  I'm a slow writer and I'm always late and so it's my fault.
[18:35.080 --> 18:40.080]  And if I had any sort of deadline ability
[18:40.320 --> 18:43.340]  to hit deadlines in my brain, I still could have done it.
[18:43.340 --> 18:45.360]  So it's on me, I'm not making excuses.
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.620]  But they didn't give us the phones until the next day.
[18:49.620 --> 18:52.780]  And traditionally, the day of the keynote,
[18:52.780 --> 18:55.080]  then in the afternoon, press briefing,
[18:55.080 --> 18:58.260]  the one-on-one briefings where they hand reviewers
[18:58.260 --> 19:00.660]  the kit you're going to get happen
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.940]  and then you can get started.
[19:01.940 --> 19:04.100]  Well, those didn't happen until the next day.
[19:04.100 --> 19:07.260]  And the event wasn't on a Tuesday, it was on a Wednesday
[19:07.260 --> 19:10.060]  because it happened in Labor Day week.
[19:10.060 --> 19:12.980]  So everything got pushed back a week.
[19:12.980 --> 19:17.060]  But they always launched the things on the next Friday.
[19:17.060 --> 19:20.240]  That's set in stone and has never, ever, ever
[19:20.240 --> 19:21.620]  been an exception to it, right?
[19:21.620 --> 19:23.900]  Phones always come out on a Friday.
[19:23.900 --> 19:28.500]  So effectively, to hit the embargo, we only had five days.
[19:28.500 --> 19:29.740]  Yeah.
[19:29.740 --> 19:32.900]  Which a week for me is really pushing it.
[19:32.900 --> 19:35.020]  And I don't shoot video, but for me,
[19:35.020 --> 19:36.900]  a week is really pushing it.
[19:36.900 --> 19:38.680]  And it turns out, it took me a week.
[19:38.680 --> 19:43.220]  Well, so candidly for me, we just kind of dropped
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.780]  the battery life testing.
[19:44.780 --> 19:46.480]  Like, you can't do it.
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.340]  Like, we were tracking it, but without that extra
[19:50.340 --> 19:52.780]  couple days, the way you want to do it is you just want
[19:52.780 --> 19:55.220]  to use the phone as normal for as long as you can.
[19:55.220 --> 19:57.900]  But we were shooting videos and looking at photos.
[19:59.500 --> 20:01.980]  We had to turn the brightness up and point a camera at it.
[20:01.980 --> 20:05.860]  And all I can tell you is that I think the battery
[20:05.860 --> 20:08.900]  runs down a little bit faster on the Pro than usual.
[20:08.900 --> 20:10.180]  I'll let you know in the future.
[20:10.180 --> 20:12.980]  But that was very candidly the thing I had to just let go.
[20:12.980 --> 20:16.820]  I kind of put something similar in my review
[20:16.820 --> 20:19.040]  where it was something, something to the effect of,
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.580]  look, when I'm testing these phones, I'm shooting
[20:21.580 --> 20:24.340]  way more video than I usually do, taking more photos
[20:24.340 --> 20:25.980]  and just using it more, right?
[20:25.980 --> 20:30.500]  Because as opposed to in a normal week where I might think,
[20:30.500 --> 20:32.620]  hey, I've been dicking around on my phone too much.
[20:32.620 --> 20:35.100]  I should sit down at my Mac and get to work, right?
[20:35.100 --> 20:36.260]  And work.
[20:36.260 --> 20:38.760]  And I've got like a sort of thing in the back of my head
[20:38.760 --> 20:41.860]  saying, don't waste too much time on your phone.
[20:41.860 --> 20:45.940]  When you're testing a new phone to try to develop
[20:45.940 --> 20:50.020]  a fully formed opinion in five days to get a review
[20:50.020 --> 20:52.200]  that you think is going to stand the test of time,
[20:52.200 --> 20:54.620]  you're using the phone all the time.
[20:54.620 --> 20:56.280]  You're trying to use the phone more.
[20:56.280 --> 21:01.180]  So it's literally, I really think impossible
[21:01.180 --> 21:04.580]  to simultaneously use a phone to review it
[21:04.580 --> 21:09.580]  and gauge what's the actual battery life.
[21:09.580 --> 21:12.540]  And the only way to gauge battery life, in my opinion,
[21:12.540 --> 21:16.020]  is to just sort of use the phone in normal use
[21:16.020 --> 21:18.420]  and then tell people, here's how the battery did.
[21:18.420 --> 21:19.860]  Because how can you test it?
[21:19.860 --> 21:22.820]  There's no test that simulates practical use.
[21:22.820 --> 21:24.220]  And it's so complicated.
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.980]  You can't run like some kind of bench.
[21:25.980 --> 21:28.920]  I know that's what Apple does is they'll just play
[21:28.920 --> 21:32.360]  like streaming video until the battery runs dry
[21:32.360 --> 21:35.320]  and say 22 hours of streaming video.
[21:35.320 --> 21:37.700]  Or music playback, that's one of my favorites, right?
[21:37.700 --> 21:40.020]  If you just let it play music on battery,
[21:40.020 --> 21:41.340]  it'll last 63 hours.
[21:41.340 --> 21:42.580]  I'm making these numbers up.
[21:42.580 --> 21:45.900]  But how is that useful, right?
[21:45.900 --> 21:48.060]  So it's interesting that they have traditionally
[21:48.060 --> 21:50.500]  used those sorts of metrics with MacBooks.
[21:51.500 --> 21:53.760]  And I sort of get why.
[21:53.760 --> 21:55.720]  It's just like, here's a thing you can do.
[21:55.720 --> 21:59.020]  With phones, I mean, and this is something
[21:59.020 --> 22:01.900]  we have chased for years, Apple has this like set
[22:01.900 --> 22:04.580]  of telemetry data that they have worked
[22:04.580 --> 22:09.300]  into some sort of model where they can model
[22:09.300 --> 22:12.740]  basically an average day of iPhone processor usage
[22:12.740 --> 22:15.260]  and sensor usage and whatever usage
[22:15.260 --> 22:17.780]  against the capacity of the battery.
[22:17.780 --> 22:19.300]  I don't have access to this model.
[22:19.300 --> 22:20.580]  So we just have to like use the phones
[22:20.580 --> 22:23.020]  like normals and guess.
[22:23.020 --> 22:24.900]  But Apple, the switch they've made,
[22:24.900 --> 22:27.860]  I think this year with, hey, it's this many hours
[22:27.860 --> 22:30.500]  of video playback, like in the past,
[22:30.500 --> 22:32.540]  they would just say like 12 hours of battery life
[22:32.540 --> 22:33.380]  or whatever it is.
[22:33.380 --> 22:35.000]  Because they have this, they have a model
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.820]  and that's why Apple is traditionally better
[22:37.820 --> 22:40.700]  at underestimating their own battery life
[22:40.700 --> 22:43.940]  because they have the data about iPhone usage
[22:43.940 --> 22:45.780]  that lets them do it in a way that they kind of can't get
[22:45.780 --> 22:46.620]  with a Mac.
[22:46.620 --> 22:50.900]  But this one's just, it's just a weird one.
[22:50.900 --> 22:53.780]  Especially in the pro because of the always on display.
[22:53.780 --> 22:54.740]  Yeah, you're right.
[22:54.740 --> 22:57.140]  And again, we've only got so much time.
[22:57.140 --> 22:59.060]  Most of the time we wanna spend using it.
[22:59.060 --> 23:02.740]  I like to try to use it the way they intend you to use it
[23:02.740 --> 23:04.740]  and the way they intend you to use these,
[23:04.740 --> 23:07.780]  the new 14 pros is with the always on display
[23:07.780 --> 23:09.420]  at its default setting.
[23:09.420 --> 23:12.820]  And so any sort of determination of, well,
[23:12.820 --> 23:15.780]  what happens if you turn off the always on display
[23:15.780 --> 23:17.100]  and just have it go off
[23:17.100 --> 23:20.200]  like all the other iPhones in existence?
[23:20.200 --> 23:22.460]  Does that actually give you a day to day boost?
[23:22.460 --> 23:24.340]  Well, there's no possible way you could figure that out
[23:24.340 --> 23:27.260]  in a week while you're simultaneously testing the phone.
[23:27.260 --> 23:28.560]  It's not possible.
[23:28.560 --> 23:30.060]  I mean, we'll find out.
[23:30.060 --> 23:30.980]  And it's just one of those things
[23:30.980 --> 23:32.140]  where I didn't wanna worry about it
[23:32.140 --> 23:33.540]  because it's like, we'll be able to do it.
[23:33.540 --> 23:35.160]  It's just, we won't have it.
[23:35.160 --> 23:38.180]  You and I won't have it in this golden week
[23:38.180 --> 23:41.140]  where we've got the new iPhones and nobody else does.
[23:41.140 --> 23:42.660]  I mean, it's going to come out
[23:42.660 --> 23:45.220]  if battery life actually suffers
[23:45.220 --> 23:46.860]  because of the always on display.
[23:48.060 --> 23:49.420]  Yeah.
[23:49.420 --> 23:52.460]  My instinct is that it, I mean, this isn't your review too.
[23:52.460 --> 23:54.180]  We're starting with like the least interesting thing.
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.020]  I know, we really are.
[23:55.020 --> 23:56.400]  We're gonna build our way up to the end.
[23:56.400 --> 23:59.340]  But like, it's a really weird always on display.
[23:59.340 --> 24:00.940]  No, I don't think it's the most,
[24:00.940 --> 24:02.800]  to me, it's the second most interesting thing.
[24:02.800 --> 24:04.980]  It's not the second most important thing,
[24:04.980 --> 24:06.860]  but I called it super interesting
[24:06.860 --> 24:09.420]  because I think it is incredibly interesting.
[24:09.420 --> 24:11.220]  So I think it's okay to start with it.
[24:11.220 --> 24:13.940]  It's a wild always on display.
[24:13.940 --> 24:15.980]  I mean, the thing I wrote in my review is,
[24:16.940 --> 24:17.960]  honestly, what did I say?
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.240]  A microjolt, thousands of microjolts of panic all week long
[24:22.240 --> 24:24.340]  every time I glance at it.
[24:24.340 --> 24:26.680]  Because before my conscious brain can register,
[24:26.680 --> 24:29.100]  yes, this is the new phone with an always on display,
[24:29.100 --> 24:32.540]  I immediately think, oh my God, my phone's broken.
[24:32.540 --> 24:34.020]  Something's gone out of control
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.500]  and the battery's ragingly depleted
[24:36.500 --> 24:38.420]  because I haven't touched it in half an hour
[24:38.420 --> 24:40.700]  and the screen is still fully on.
[24:40.700 --> 24:41.540]  Yeah.
[24:41.540 --> 24:42.620]  No, it's really weird.
[24:42.620 --> 24:44.780]  So I was sitting next to Becca Versace,
[24:44.780 --> 24:47.500]  our video director who was making the review with me,
[24:47.500 --> 24:48.740]  and we both had them.
[24:48.740 --> 24:52.140]  And both of us, all day long, were tapping on the screen
[24:52.140 --> 24:53.700]  because we were like, why is this on?
[24:53.700 --> 24:54.540]  It's just strange.
[24:54.540 --> 24:57.740]  Like most, I mean, Apple's late to the game here.
[24:57.740 --> 24:58.880]  Android phones have had this forever.
[24:58.880 --> 25:02.080]  And like mostly what Android phones mean by always on
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.020]  is mostly off.
[25:04.020 --> 25:06.720]  Like the game they have played is they can drop,
[25:06.720 --> 25:08.620]  they can turn off most of an OLED display,
[25:08.620 --> 25:10.660]  it goes to black, and they can selectively
[25:10.660 --> 25:12.380]  light up some pixels to show you a clock.
[25:12.380 --> 25:14.700]  Right, and maybe like a signal strength indicate,
[25:14.700 --> 25:16.220]  you know, like the status bar stays on
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.180]  or something like that.
[25:17.180 --> 25:18.880]  But you get like the date and the clock
[25:18.880 --> 25:22.740]  in ghosted out white on an OLED black, and it's...
[25:22.740 --> 25:23.580]  It looks fine.
[25:23.580 --> 25:26.140]  Right, and now there's like however many years of iteration,
[25:26.140 --> 25:28.240]  like seven years of iteration in Android.
[25:28.240 --> 25:30.000]  So now there's customizations,
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.460]  there's the different manufacturers have different looks.
[25:32.460 --> 25:34.820]  The off screen looks different than the lock screen.
[25:34.820 --> 25:36.220]  It's a whole world.
[25:36.220 --> 25:38.500]  It's a whole ecosystem of always on displays.
[25:38.500 --> 25:42.260]  And Apple's like, it's your lock screen, but dimmer.
[25:42.260 --> 25:43.100]  It really is.
[25:43.100 --> 25:44.020]  It's just really weird.
[25:44.020 --> 25:47.020]  But it's, again, this is something I'm gonna do
[25:47.020 --> 25:52.020]  for follow up, but I actually dug out like my old iPhone 5S
[25:52.420 --> 25:56.000]  and powered it on, and I actually have a suspicion
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.860]  that the new phone in always on state
[25:59.860 --> 26:04.440]  is about as bright as like a 10 year old iPhone
[26:04.440 --> 26:06.700]  with like sort of default brightness settings.
[26:06.700 --> 26:07.640]  It's that bright.
[26:07.640 --> 26:09.100]  I'm not joking.
[26:09.100 --> 26:10.620]  Like I wrote in my review,
[26:10.620 --> 26:13.460]  if the phone sort of malfunctioned or broke
[26:13.460 --> 26:16.340]  or like three years from now, it was sort of flaking out,
[26:16.340 --> 26:20.700]  and the maximum screen brightness that I could ever get
[26:20.700 --> 26:23.360]  was about as bright as it gets in always on mode,
[26:23.360 --> 26:24.920]  you could totally use the phone.
[26:24.920 --> 26:26.660]  Like the way that people will use a phone
[26:26.660 --> 26:29.140]  with a cracked screen that isn't all that cracked.
[26:29.140 --> 26:31.020]  There's all sorts of ways your phone can get damaged
[26:31.020 --> 26:32.700]  and people still use it.
[26:32.700 --> 26:36.460]  I was in New York on Wednesday for an all afternoon meeting
[26:36.460 --> 26:39.140]  that, again, another reason my review was late,
[26:39.140 --> 26:41.540]  but my fault, but it was interesting
[26:41.540 --> 26:42.540]  to travel with the phone.
[26:42.540 --> 26:45.280]  But for reasons could not, had to happen this week,
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.000]  even though ordinarily I'd go to extraordinary lengths
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.560]  not to schedule anything during iPhone review week.
[26:50.560 --> 26:53.340]  But I was on the train from Philly and I saw a guy
[26:53.340 --> 26:55.580]  and I was like, whoa, that's a wild looking phone.
[26:55.580 --> 26:57.040]  I think it was some kind of Android phone,
[26:57.040 --> 26:59.780]  but he'd obviously, it wasn't cracked,
[26:59.780 --> 27:04.780]  but about one third of the way over on his screen
[27:05.300 --> 27:08.780]  while holding it in a regular up and down vertical format,
[27:08.780 --> 27:13.100]  there was like this lightsaber bright vertical line
[27:13.100 --> 27:15.580]  from the bottom to the top, perfectly straight,
[27:15.580 --> 27:18.620]  maybe about 10 pixels wide.
[27:18.620 --> 27:22.400]  Like clearly the brightest the screen could possibly get
[27:22.400 --> 27:25.620]  just permanently, just, and I salute him.
[27:25.620 --> 27:28.020]  And the guy obviously wasn't, he was well-dried,
[27:28.020 --> 27:30.380]  had a full suit on and he's like, ah, fuck it.
[27:30.380 --> 27:32.700]  And it's like sort of a cool look really.
[27:34.580 --> 27:36.060]  That's just his wallpaper, look bro.
[27:36.060 --> 27:37.580]  No, I thought it was his wallpaper,
[27:37.580 --> 27:40.140]  but then I saw him flicking around and it's like,
[27:40.140 --> 27:42.740]  oh shit, man, it looked like a cool wallpaper.
[27:42.740 --> 27:44.380]  And instead it's like,
[27:44.380 --> 27:46.140]  that's just how his phone looks all the time.
[27:46.140 --> 27:49.820]  But I swear if that's as bright as the iPhone 14 Pro
[27:49.820 --> 27:52.020]  ever got, you could totally use this phone
[27:52.020 --> 27:54.660]  except maybe in bright light.
[27:54.660 --> 27:58.660]  But I have to say too, on the way home from New York
[27:58.660 --> 28:01.560]  down to Philly, I was like, there's a five,
[28:01.560 --> 28:04.140]  yeah, five o'clock, five to six Acela.
[28:04.140 --> 28:07.980]  And around this time of year, the sun is getting lower
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.820]  and it was a really nice day Wednesday.
[28:09.820 --> 28:11.140]  So the sun was,
[28:11.140 --> 28:15.500]  and I happened to sit on the sunny side of the train
[28:15.500 --> 28:20.500]  and super bright sunlight streaming through the window
[28:20.580 --> 28:23.940]  of the train onto the table desk.
[28:23.940 --> 28:25.580]  I don't know what you call those things on the Acela.
[28:25.580 --> 28:26.620]  I guess it's a table.
[28:26.620 --> 28:29.340]  I'm typing on my MacBook Pro,
[28:29.340 --> 28:32.460]  actually writing my review for squeezing another hour
[28:32.460 --> 28:36.060]  of writing in with the phone sitting next to it.
[28:36.060 --> 28:38.580]  And because the sun was so bright,
[28:38.580 --> 28:42.140]  the phone detected that it was bright.
[28:42.140 --> 28:45.460]  It is insane how bright the Always On was
[28:45.460 --> 28:49.220]  while it was bathed in the full rays
[28:49.220 --> 28:51.820]  of mid-September bright sunshine.
[28:51.820 --> 28:53.820]  It was shocking.
[28:53.820 --> 28:54.740]  Yeah.
[28:54.740 --> 28:56.660]  Yeah, I think they missed a trick with it.
[28:56.660 --> 28:59.500]  I think it would have been better if it was more off
[28:59.500 --> 29:00.820]  and they allowed some of these.
[29:00.820 --> 29:02.180]  There's a lot of new widgets,
[29:02.180 --> 29:03.420]  like the whole Dynamic Island
[29:03.420 --> 29:05.340]  is basically a new widget system.
[29:05.340 --> 29:07.380]  So I get there's only so many more widgets
[29:07.380 --> 29:10.060]  they can demand of developers,
[29:10.060 --> 29:12.660]  but there's a move here
[29:12.660 --> 29:14.220]  where they actually make it more different
[29:14.220 --> 29:15.060]  than the lock screen.
[29:15.060 --> 29:16.500]  And that makes more sense.
[29:16.500 --> 29:17.540]  And I think they just need to get there.
[29:17.540 --> 29:19.140]  And what they will say is we didn't want to do
[29:19.140 --> 29:20.420]  the Always On that everyone else is doing.
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.740]  So we did it our way.
[29:21.740 --> 29:26.580]  And it's like, well, sometimes it's fine to piggyback
[29:26.580 --> 29:29.180]  on seven years of Android iteration.
[29:29.180 --> 29:32.660]  And that whole huge market has landed on mostly black
[29:32.660 --> 29:34.420]  and white for a reason.
[29:34.420 --> 29:38.460]  I do think we have this weird
[29:38.460 --> 29:41.220]  and it's been here forever or not forever,
[29:41.220 --> 29:45.980]  but for as long as the iPhone Sam dominant era
[29:45.980 --> 29:50.980]  of smartphones has existed, let's say 2010 onward.
[29:51.060 --> 29:53.980]  This, and it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon
[29:53.980 --> 29:58.980]  where Apple and the entire Android industry
[29:58.980 --> 30:03.780]  have this very strange relationship with each other, right?
[30:03.780 --> 30:07.020]  And I know some people go nuts when I point it out,
[30:07.020 --> 30:12.020]  but it's like the Android side will at times
[30:12.180 --> 30:14.820]  shamelessly copy from Apple.
[30:14.820 --> 30:18.940]  There's a new Samsung Galaxy Home app,
[30:18.940 --> 30:21.820]  which you cannot believe when you see it
[30:21.820 --> 30:24.220]  that it's not the iOS Home app.
[30:25.660 --> 30:27.120]  I mean, it's not just at a glance.
[30:27.120 --> 30:28.900]  It's like you would actually have to get there
[30:28.900 --> 30:30.960]  and really look at the fonts to see,
[30:30.960 --> 30:32.300]  oh, that's not San Francisco.
[30:32.300 --> 30:33.740]  That's the Android font.
[30:33.740 --> 30:35.020]  It is so cool.
[30:35.020 --> 30:38.580]  It's one of the most preposterous ripoffs I've ever seen,
[30:38.580 --> 30:40.780]  which is ridiculous because everybody thinks
[30:40.780 --> 30:43.420]  iOS's Home app stinks, right?
[30:43.420 --> 30:46.180]  It's one of my least favorite interfaces
[30:46.180 --> 30:48.260]  that Apple has ever come up with.
[30:48.260 --> 30:53.160]  It boggles my mind that this is still the home interface
[30:53.160 --> 30:54.380]  and yet Samsung copied it.
[30:54.380 --> 30:57.660]  And then on the flip side, Apple seemed,
[30:57.660 --> 30:59.940]  not that they haven't, there's certainly ideas
[30:59.940 --> 31:01.900]  that were Android first that they've taken, right?
[31:01.900 --> 31:05.580]  And notifications, iOS was way behind on like
[31:05.580 --> 31:08.700]  a notification, they didn't even have a notification center
[31:08.700 --> 31:11.540]  until after it was well-established on Android.
[31:11.540 --> 31:15.180]  So there are ideas that have gone Android first.
[31:15.180 --> 31:17.240]  I'm not saying that Apple doesn't take anything
[31:17.240 --> 31:19.840]  that comes from Android and then do it,
[31:19.840 --> 31:21.620]  but there are other times where it seems like
[31:21.620 --> 31:25.780]  their pride keeps them from following something
[31:25.780 --> 31:27.980]  that they didn't do first when they should.
[31:27.980 --> 31:29.460]  Yeah.
[31:29.460 --> 31:31.540]  Yeah, and there's an element of that copying back and forth
[31:31.540 --> 31:34.820]  is it's kind of just related to switching costs.
[31:34.820 --> 31:37.780]  Like one of the reasons things tend to look
[31:37.780 --> 31:41.320]  like the Apple way is because asking someone
[31:41.320 --> 31:43.960]  to think about a new way of turning on the light bulbs
[31:43.960 --> 31:46.460]  in your house is too much.
[31:46.460 --> 31:48.860]  So might as well just look like the phone you had before.
[31:48.860 --> 31:53.700]  Like the amount you can gain by reinventing that
[31:53.700 --> 31:56.300]  is very low compared to the amount of,
[31:56.300 --> 31:57.420]  well, actually we needed to,
[31:57.420 --> 32:00.980]  like Android notifications overall are way different, right?
[32:00.980 --> 32:02.980]  Apple is just like insistent that you're gonna think
[32:02.980 --> 32:06.540]  about things their way, even when the best way
[32:06.540 --> 32:09.700]  has been kind of, like I'm saying, relentlessly iterated on
[32:09.700 --> 32:11.760]  in the biggest phone markets in the world,
[32:11.760 --> 32:13.060]  in China and India, right?
[32:13.060 --> 32:15.660]  Like that's where Android phones are huge.
[32:15.660 --> 32:18.320]  And there's ferocious competition
[32:18.320 --> 32:19.700]  for the best always on display.
[32:19.700 --> 32:20.820]  And you can just like boost it
[32:20.820 --> 32:23.300]  and no one's gonna get mad at you.
[32:23.300 --> 32:28.300]  It's, so the first thing, and I spent the most words on,
[32:28.980 --> 32:30.980]  is just the fact that it really,
[32:30.980 --> 32:34.740]  and I think most people who, obviously my site in particular
[32:34.740 --> 32:39.000]  is from people who are fully permanently all in
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.940]  on the iOS side.
[32:40.940 --> 32:43.820]  And the biggest lock-in is honestly just the way
[32:43.820 --> 32:48.820]  your mind is sort of, as a human, right, locks into the way
[32:49.460 --> 32:51.100]  the system works, right?
[32:51.100 --> 32:53.400]  I remember at like sort of the peak
[32:53.400 --> 32:56.220]  of Mac versus Windows competition.
[32:56.220 --> 33:00.660]  And I would say it's epitomized by the era
[33:00.660 --> 33:05.660]  when Adobe, Photoshop and Illustrator,
[33:05.740 --> 33:09.140]  and like when InDesign was new,
[33:09.140 --> 33:12.580]  and that those were really the only apps designers used.
[33:12.580 --> 33:17.380]  And Adobe had really pulled off the very difficult feat
[33:17.380 --> 33:20.140]  of complete parity between them.
[33:20.140 --> 33:25.140]  And the Mac user interface nerd that I am combined with
[33:25.260 --> 33:28.920]  at the time being a designer was annoyed by all the ways
[33:28.920 --> 33:33.920]  that Adobe's previously gloriously Mac human interface,
[33:35.300 --> 33:38.740]  consistent apps had sort of gone in a,
[33:38.740 --> 33:41.500]  not in a Windows way, but the way that app,
[33:41.500 --> 33:43.620]  big companies like Adobe that are trying to pull off
[33:43.620 --> 33:46.660]  something like that sort of developed their own language.
[33:46.660 --> 33:50.860]  Right, they developed an Adobe style of interface
[33:50.860 --> 33:52.260]  that was on Mac and Windows.
[33:52.260 --> 33:54.500]  Kai's Power Tools is my favorite.
[33:54.500 --> 33:55.840]  Yeah, oh, that's.
[33:57.580 --> 33:59.380]  Just like, what is happening here?
[34:00.660 --> 34:03.820]  I used to enjoy, we had it at the student newspaper.
[34:03.820 --> 34:05.140]  I used to, I never used it.
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.460]  I never did a damn thing with it because obviously
[34:07.460 --> 34:09.460]  the stuff that Kai's Power Tools did
[34:09.460 --> 34:10.840]  is not my style of design,
[34:10.840 --> 34:13.940]  but I loved firing it up just to play with it
[34:13.940 --> 34:15.420]  because it was glorious.
[34:15.420 --> 34:20.260]  No, but it really was, and if your job was using Photoshop
[34:20.260 --> 34:22.780]  and Illustrator and that's it,
[34:22.780 --> 34:25.340]  you could have easily just switched from Mac to Windows
[34:25.340 --> 34:27.580]  or vice versa because the Adobe tools really
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.900]  were completely compatible, but nobody did it
[34:29.900 --> 34:32.140]  because you just one side or the other,
[34:32.140 --> 34:34.980]  you were locked into the way the file system was organized
[34:34.980 --> 34:36.140]  and stuff like that.
[34:36.140 --> 34:39.740]  So my readers are obviously on the iOS side of things.
[34:39.740 --> 34:41.640]  I think that they're gonna be like me
[34:41.640 --> 34:44.620]  where obviously Apple's very late to the idea
[34:44.620 --> 34:47.020]  of having an always on iPhone display.
[34:47.020 --> 34:50.540]  And for years, the longer you've been on the iPhone,
[34:50.540 --> 34:52.780]  the more I think ingrained it is,
[34:52.780 --> 34:55.900]  is the idea that one of the top ways
[34:55.900 --> 34:58.160]  to preserve your battery is to keep the screen off
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.740]  as much as you can and going back further in time
[35:02.740 --> 35:05.300]  to keep the brightness a little dimmer
[35:05.300 --> 35:06.400]  than you'd like it to be.
[35:06.400 --> 35:10.620]  And you could really eke out a lot more all day battery life
[35:10.620 --> 35:14.900]  in the early era of smartphones by keeping the brightness.
[35:14.900 --> 35:16.200]  This doesn't actually look great,
[35:16.200 --> 35:18.680]  but you keep it easy enough to read,
[35:18.680 --> 35:20.820]  but not as bright as you'd really like it to be.
[35:20.820 --> 35:25.180]  But you could definitely see, oh, I get through all day now
[35:25.180 --> 35:27.900]  whereas when I had the brightness up where it looks best,
[35:27.900 --> 35:29.420]  it's dead by eight o'clock.
[35:29.420 --> 35:33.940]  So it's just ingrained in your habit as an iPhone user to,
[35:33.940 --> 35:37.180]  if you're not using it, you want the screen off.
[35:37.180 --> 35:39.180]  Yeah, it's driving me nuts
[35:39.180 --> 35:41.520]  that the goddamn screen's always on.
[35:41.520 --> 35:43.060]  So here's the other question,
[35:43.060 --> 35:45.060]  the thing I wound up with in the review.
[35:45.060 --> 35:46.300]  You can turn it off.
[35:46.300 --> 35:49.560]  What is the purpose of the always on display?
[35:49.560 --> 35:53.780]  Cynically, my answer is they need to add more stuff
[35:53.780 --> 35:55.540]  to the iPhone every year.
[35:55.540 --> 35:56.780]  And they finally got to the point
[35:56.780 --> 35:58.180]  where this was on the list.
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.980]  I don't think there's a point beyond it
[36:00.980 --> 36:03.440]  because they're not attracting Android switchers
[36:03.440 --> 36:05.420]  because they've added an always on display,
[36:05.420 --> 36:07.340]  especially one like this.
[36:07.340 --> 36:09.620]  I think part of it is that,
[36:09.620 --> 36:11.460]  and they wanted to do it their way,
[36:11.460 --> 36:14.080]  and their way means showing off technically
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.060]  in a way that nobody else can compete with, right?
[36:17.060 --> 36:18.740]  I don't think there's a phone on the market
[36:18.740 --> 36:20.540]  that could possibly, and like you said,
[36:20.540 --> 36:24.380]  if there is a noticeable battery life detriment to this,
[36:24.380 --> 36:26.900]  it's not so bad that we're not getting through a full day
[36:26.900 --> 36:28.920]  with the iPhone 14 Pro, right?
[36:28.920 --> 36:29.760]  I mean-
[36:29.760 --> 36:31.460]  Yeah, no, happily getting through a full day.
[36:31.460 --> 36:33.780]  I would say that maybe they waited to add,
[36:33.780 --> 36:35.540]  this is the nonsensical answer.
[36:35.540 --> 36:38.340]  They needed to get to, what's it, the A16
[36:38.340 --> 36:41.900]  with its battery draw against the battery in this thing.
[36:41.900 --> 36:43.820]  And they could finally add it in
[36:43.820 --> 36:46.460]  an acceptable rate of power consumption
[36:46.460 --> 36:48.300]  because they got the chip that's efficient enough
[36:48.300 --> 36:49.220]  to pull it off.
[36:50.220 --> 36:53.060]  I'm sure that it's some mishmash of those things.
[36:53.060 --> 36:55.620]  Yeah, and the other thing, I don't understand it.
[36:55.620 --> 36:58.380]  If I ever had the opportunity to pick somebody's brain
[36:58.380 --> 37:00.620]  for an hour and have them explain it to me,
[37:00.620 --> 37:03.860]  I understand how going from like a 60 hertz refresh
[37:03.860 --> 37:07.400]  to 120 is technically difficult, right?
[37:07.400 --> 37:09.940]  Higher frame rate is just,
[37:09.940 --> 37:12.160]  you don't even have to understand how cameras work
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.140]  or displays work.
[37:14.140 --> 37:16.180]  Going faster is harder.
[37:17.540 --> 37:20.420]  I've never quite understood why going to one hertz
[37:20.420 --> 37:23.800]  is technically difficult, but I am to understand
[37:23.800 --> 37:26.220]  that it's actually incredibly difficult,
[37:26.220 --> 37:29.120]  that updating once per second is actually really,
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.340]  really hard and that these displays are also
[37:32.340 --> 37:34.560]  very, very expensive to produce.
[37:34.560 --> 37:37.260]  It really does justify the price delta
[37:38.600 --> 37:41.980]  beyond marketing segmentation.
[37:41.980 --> 37:45.540]  At just a pure cost to produce these devices way,
[37:45.540 --> 37:48.620]  the display, the promotion displays are really
[37:48.620 --> 37:53.620]  more expensive than the ones in the iPhone 14 non-pro.
[37:54.540 --> 37:57.500]  Is that a one hertz difficulty
[37:57.500 --> 38:00.100]  or is that a promotion from one to 120?
[38:00.100 --> 38:01.780]  I am to understand that, well,
[38:01.780 --> 38:04.420]  cause you have to have promotion to go to one hertz, right?
[38:04.420 --> 38:05.260]  Sure.
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.580]  Right, because nobody's gonna buy a display
[38:06.580 --> 38:08.640]  that only updates it once a second.
[38:08.640 --> 38:13.300]  Although I guess that's sort of like,
[38:13.300 --> 38:15.340]  I guess that's like a Kindle.
[38:15.340 --> 38:17.540]  Yeah, it's like many e-ing displays,
[38:17.540 --> 38:19.940]  but also like Apple's very serious about screen time.
[38:19.940 --> 38:21.500]  They just locked you into once per second
[38:21.500 --> 38:22.580]  for a couple of hours a day.
[38:22.580 --> 38:23.400]  Yeah.
[38:23.400 --> 38:24.820]  I mean, how do you solve the social media problem?
[38:24.820 --> 38:26.180]  Yeah, that would be a good thing to do.
[38:26.180 --> 38:28.620]  You could like, and if you have your kids set
[38:28.620 --> 38:30.980]  on a schedule like that, you could be like, you know what?
[38:30.980 --> 38:32.780]  You can use your phones and your devices
[38:32.780 --> 38:34.940]  as much as you want after seven o'clock at night,
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.840]  but you know, it'll be at one hertz.
[38:36.840 --> 38:40.060]  Yeah, TikTok is effectively over for you.
[38:40.060 --> 38:40.900]  Yeah.
[38:43.580 --> 38:45.360]  TikTok at one frame per second.
[38:46.500 --> 38:48.060]  Oh, that would be great.
[38:48.060 --> 38:51.240]  Mine, yeah, and the promotion part,
[38:51.240 --> 38:53.260]  the fact that it dynamically shifts
[38:53.260 --> 38:55.340]  from 120 all the way down to one.
[38:55.340 --> 38:57.420]  Also, apparently, well, of course,
[38:57.420 --> 38:59.100]  that does sound technically difficult,
[38:59.100 --> 39:01.780]  even as a total lay person, not even understanding it.
[39:01.780 --> 39:04.100]  You just think, yeah, that seems really wild,
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.420]  especially if it's done in a way
[39:05.420 --> 39:08.420]  that the user is never, ever, ever supposed to notice.
[39:08.420 --> 39:10.740]  And in fact, I never, ever notice
[39:10.740 --> 39:13.500]  that it always seems to be running at 120 to me.
[39:13.500 --> 39:16.620]  Difficult to do and expensive to produce.
[39:16.620 --> 39:17.460]  I get it.
[39:17.460 --> 39:20.240]  Here's my non-cynical answer to what they think
[39:20.240 --> 39:23.880]  the purpose of the always on display is,
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.880]  which is these live activities, which aren't out yet.
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.140]  So it really makes it a hard marketing sell
[39:33.140 --> 39:34.380]  at the moment, right?
[39:34.380 --> 39:38.340]  It's, I guess, coming in Iowa 16.1,
[39:38.340 --> 39:41.100]  because the beta, the first beta for 16.1
[39:41.100 --> 39:43.380]  came out like two days ago, and now it's been there.
[39:43.380 --> 39:45.380]  Yeah, and they have been saying this year,
[39:45.380 --> 39:48.160]  and it's September, so it feels like it's gotta be
[39:48.160 --> 39:49.180]  in this next rush.
[39:49.180 --> 39:50.740]  Yeah, but on the other hand,
[39:50.740 --> 39:54.820]  they usually get to at least the.2 by the end of the year,
[39:54.820 --> 39:56.740]  if not the.3, right?
[39:56.740 --> 39:59.700]  They've sort of, and I think to their credit,
[39:59.700 --> 40:01.460]  I think it's actually worked out great,
[40:01.460 --> 40:04.300]  even though it's badgering users to get to,
[40:04.300 --> 40:06.060]  I mean, what's Iowa's 15 up to?
[40:06.060 --> 40:07.820]  A 15.7, I think?
[40:07.820 --> 40:11.040]  Maybe it's 15.6, or wherever it finished.
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.260]  But they get six or seven of these point updates
[40:15.260 --> 40:18.700]  out throughout the year, all the way up through the summer,
[40:18.700 --> 40:21.220]  while they're already working on the next year's thing,
[40:21.220 --> 40:23.580]  and break features apart into them.
[40:23.580 --> 40:25.940]  So it's either coming out, I don't know,
[40:25.940 --> 40:28.340]  next month or sometime this year.
[40:28.340 --> 40:30.700]  But it does, if that's sort of the point,
[40:30.700 --> 40:33.300]  and it makes sense that, okay,
[40:33.300 --> 40:36.580]  the hardware's the thing that is set in motion
[40:38.140 --> 40:39.780]  at least two years in advance.
[40:39.780 --> 40:42.420]  And they probably knew more than two years,
[40:42.420 --> 40:44.380]  I guess three or four years ago,
[40:44.380 --> 40:48.620]  that this would be the year when the iPhone 14 Pros
[40:48.620 --> 40:52.140]  should have this always on display.
[40:52.140 --> 40:53.380]  So that meant the software,
[40:53.380 --> 40:57.780]  and if the reason is to show off these live activities
[40:57.780 --> 40:59.980]  so that you could just leave your phone at the desk
[40:59.980 --> 41:04.980]  and have the Packers game in a live activity
[41:05.260 --> 41:06.680]  while you're doing something else,
[41:06.680 --> 41:09.020]  and every time you glance at the phone,
[41:09.020 --> 41:12.300]  the score is accurate and the time remaining is accurate
[41:12.300 --> 41:15.460]  to within 15, 30 seconds or something like that,
[41:15.460 --> 41:18.660]  it makes sense that they're coming out in the same year.
[41:18.660 --> 41:21.340]  And I think it's just, it's sort of,
[41:21.340 --> 41:23.740]  unfortunately this feature and software
[41:23.740 --> 41:26.080]  wasn't ready in time in September.
[41:26.080 --> 41:29.620]  But is that even, no matter how useful these live activities
[41:29.620 --> 41:31.300]  are going to prove once we have them,
[41:31.300 --> 41:32.700]  and we don't have them yet, right?
[41:32.700 --> 41:35.060]  None of, it's not even like Apple has them
[41:35.060 --> 41:38.340]  and third parties have to wait till later this year.
[41:38.340 --> 41:41.540]  The live activities API just isn't in iOS 16.
[41:42.420 --> 41:44.740]  I still don't know if it's worth it, right?
[41:44.740 --> 41:45.780]  I don't know.
[41:45.780 --> 41:47.640]  Maybe that's just me, though, that I don't,
[41:47.640 --> 41:49.620]  if I was going to follow the game,
[41:50.620 --> 41:53.740]  it wouldn't be by following it on my iPhone
[41:53.740 --> 41:55.700]  while it's sitting on a table.
[41:55.700 --> 41:57.780]  Well, maybe.
[41:57.780 --> 41:58.980]  I mean, there's an element.
[41:58.980 --> 42:01.940]  Do you do the thing where you flip your phone over
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.780]  when you're at a restaurant or you're talking to,
[42:03.780 --> 42:04.700]  I do this all the time.
[42:04.700 --> 42:07.860]  I keep it in my pocket is what I do.
[42:07.860 --> 42:09.240]  So yeah, so I'm one of these people
[42:09.240 --> 42:11.060]  that takes their phone out and then to indicate
[42:11.060 --> 42:12.380]  that I'm actually paying attention to you.
[42:12.380 --> 42:13.840]  Right.
[42:13.840 --> 42:15.340]  So a lot of activities, by the way,
[42:15.340 --> 42:18.940]  to me overall seems like the feature of iOS 16,
[42:18.940 --> 42:22.260]  like maybe the most important feature of iOS 16.
[42:22.260 --> 42:23.820]  It's hard to evaluate,
[42:23.820 --> 42:27.440]  but the dynamic island is built on live activities.
[42:27.440 --> 42:29.980]  The promise of that whole thing depends on that shipping
[42:29.980 --> 42:31.560]  and developers using it.
[42:31.560 --> 42:34.780]  So I could see a world where, yeah,
[42:34.780 --> 42:37.020]  there's a game on that I want to pay attention to,
[42:37.020 --> 42:38.460]  but I'm out and talking to someone
[42:38.460 --> 42:39.660]  and instead of flipping my phone over,
[42:39.660 --> 42:42.060]  the score is updating at one Hertz or whatever it is.
[42:42.060 --> 42:45.580]  But on the other end, doesn't this defeat the purpose though
[42:45.580 --> 42:50.180]  with the screen being so bright that, right?
[42:50.180 --> 42:53.260]  So me and you go out to lunch or dinner
[42:53.260 --> 42:54.100]  or something like that.
[42:54.100 --> 42:56.700]  And you want to do your thing,
[42:56.700 --> 42:58.780]  which I try to keep my phone in my pocket
[42:58.780 --> 43:00.720]  in such social situations,
[43:00.720 --> 43:04.140]  but you want to make it seem as though you're engaged,
[43:04.140 --> 43:06.900]  you're present in the conversation at the table,
[43:06.900 --> 43:09.480]  but you are watching the packers
[43:09.480 --> 43:11.700]  or trying to stay up to date because damn it,
[43:11.700 --> 43:13.380]  who the hell decided to have this dinner
[43:13.380 --> 43:15.660]  when the packers were on Thursday night football.
[43:15.660 --> 43:18.720]  And there's your phone at this crazy brightness.
[43:20.300 --> 43:22.380]  Right, it would make more sense at black and white
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.220]  than just the scores.
[43:23.220 --> 43:24.940]  Yeah, there's, again,
[43:24.940 --> 43:28.860]  I think Apple wants you to use your phone less.
[43:28.860 --> 43:32.540]  I saw Tim Cook and Johnny Ivan learn Paul Jobs at Code.
[43:32.540 --> 43:34.900]  And Kara is always saying like the point,
[43:34.900 --> 43:36.700]  the reason that journalists are here is to ask questions.
[43:36.700 --> 43:37.620]  So I always go and ask questions.
[43:37.620 --> 43:39.220]  And I was like, you guys are talking about
[43:39.220 --> 43:41.820]  how much Steve Jobs hates social networks.
[43:41.820 --> 43:44.140]  Like you make the phones of the social networks run on,
[43:44.140 --> 43:45.420]  and he's like, yeah, we have screen time.
[43:45.420 --> 43:46.780]  We want you to use your phone less.
[43:46.780 --> 43:50.220]  And so I get it, like there's some element of this
[43:50.220 --> 43:52.060]  where the always on display
[43:52.060 --> 43:54.660]  theoretically lets you use your phone less
[43:54.660 --> 43:57.380]  because the information is passively coming to you.
[43:57.380 --> 43:59.780]  But it's so bright that it still feels like
[43:59.780 --> 44:00.820]  it's actively coming to you.
[44:00.820 --> 44:01.660]  Yeah.
[44:03.380 --> 44:05.040]  I guess that's, we'll see.
[44:05.040 --> 44:07.540]  I don't want to pass judgment on the live activities
[44:07.540 --> 44:10.300]  before I've used it because it seems innovative
[44:10.300 --> 44:12.180]  and new enough that one of those things
[44:12.180 --> 44:14.700]  where my imagination of how little I might use it
[44:14.700 --> 44:16.980]  is I might be missing the ballpark.
[44:16.980 --> 44:17.820]  Well, this is how you,
[44:17.820 --> 44:19.420]  I think this is why we should start talking about the island.
[44:19.420 --> 44:21.620]  Well, the point of the island is live activity.
[44:21.620 --> 44:24.300]  Let's take a break though first, before we do.
[44:24.300 --> 44:26.060]  I got to take care of some business here, Neelai.
[44:26.060 --> 44:27.540]  You see, you don't know anything about running
[44:27.540 --> 44:30.580]  a internet publication.
[44:31.620 --> 44:32.600]  No, I don't make any money.
[44:32.600 --> 44:33.500]  I just spend money.
[44:33.500 --> 44:35.080]  That's the great part of my game.
[44:35.080 --> 44:36.700]  I've got bills to pay, my friend.
[44:36.700 --> 44:39.280]  Let me tell you about my good friends at Backblaze.
[44:39.280 --> 44:42.740]  This is one of my favorite long-term sponsors
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.340]  of Daring Fireball and the talk show.
[44:44.340 --> 44:47.420]  Unlimited computer backup for Macs and PCs.
[44:47.420 --> 44:49.440]  It is seven bucks a month.
[44:49.440 --> 44:51.300]  You can back up your documents, everything.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.880]  Everything, all your user stuff.
[44:52.880 --> 44:55.040]  You back up your documents, your music, your photos,
[44:55.040 --> 44:58.720]  your videos, your drawings, your projects, all of your data.
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.020]  It gets backed up to their world-class data centers
[45:03.020 --> 45:04.580]  at Backblaze.
[45:04.580 --> 45:07.500]  It is great Mac software.
[45:07.500 --> 45:12.020]  You install it, you sign in, it runs.
[45:12.020 --> 45:13.940]  It is a great little interface
[45:13.940 --> 45:16.540]  and you just don't know it's there.
[45:16.540 --> 45:18.800]  It is not one of these things like all of a sudden
[45:18.800 --> 45:21.160]  you're using your Mac and then Backblaze decides
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.720]  it's time for a backup and you can tell
[45:23.720 --> 45:25.220]  Backblaze is doing this.
[45:25.220 --> 45:26.500]  You have no idea when it's doing it.
[45:26.500 --> 45:27.500]  It just runs.
[45:27.500 --> 45:30.740]  It just runs and it just sips data
[45:30.740 --> 45:33.240]  and all your stuff is in their cloud.
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.120]  You'll never notice it's there but all of your data
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.040]  is backed up and if you ever need it,
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.640]  if emergency strikes, your MacBook gets stolen,
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.220]  if you spill water all over it and it dies
[45:46.220 --> 45:49.300]  or you're just away from your computer
[45:49.300 --> 45:51.740]  but you need something that you know is on your computer
[45:51.740 --> 45:53.540]  but you wanna get it like from your phone,
[45:53.540 --> 45:55.420]  well, they have iOS, Android apps.
[45:55.420 --> 45:57.880]  You can get any of your stuff that's in your backup.
[45:57.880 --> 46:00.260]  If you need all of your data,
[46:00.260 --> 46:03.160]  you can just sign into Backblaze on another device
[46:03.160 --> 46:04.460]  and start downloading it.
[46:04.460 --> 46:05.300]  That'll work.
[46:05.300 --> 46:06.340]  That's one way to do it.
[46:06.340 --> 46:09.000]  If you just need one file from another machine,
[46:09.000 --> 46:10.820]  you can just log in, get that file.
[46:10.820 --> 46:13.420]  But what if you need everything real fast?
[46:13.420 --> 46:14.260]  Guess what?
[46:14.260 --> 46:16.580]  You can restore by mail, not email, real mail.
[46:16.580 --> 46:19.660]  They'll send you like a flash key or a hard drive
[46:19.660 --> 46:22.500]  with all of your data and they'll just overnight it
[46:22.500 --> 46:25.340]  through FedEx or something like that right to your door
[46:25.340 --> 46:26.860]  and if you get a hard drive restore,
[46:26.860 --> 46:30.100]  you can restore it to your machine or to a new machine
[46:30.100 --> 46:32.740]  or something like that and then just send the drive
[46:32.740 --> 46:34.860]  back to them within 30 days.
[46:34.860 --> 46:37.460]  You get a full refund for the actual drive
[46:37.460 --> 46:39.780]  so you don't even pay for the drive.
[46:39.780 --> 46:41.820]  They'll just mail it to you overnight.
[46:41.820 --> 46:44.480]  You get the data off, send the drive back to them.
[46:44.480 --> 46:45.320]  Boom, you're done.
[46:45.320 --> 46:48.400]  I've heard from readers, knock on wood,
[46:48.400 --> 46:51.580]  I've never needed that type of restore from Backblaze
[46:51.580 --> 46:53.860]  but I've heard from readers and listeners over the years
[46:53.860 --> 46:55.860]  who have and they're like, I couldn't believe it.
[46:55.860 --> 46:57.500]  I didn't think it would happen to me.
[46:57.500 --> 46:58.740]  Everybody says that.
[46:58.740 --> 47:00.000]  I needed it right away.
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.900]  There it was, ding dong, next morning,
[47:01.900 --> 47:05.220]  hard drive, all my stuff and it really was all my stuff.
[47:05.220 --> 47:09.440]  They have restored over 55 billion files for customers.
[47:09.440 --> 47:12.740]  You can get started with a trial, no credit card required
[47:12.740 --> 47:16.220]  at backblaze.com slash the talk show,
[47:16.220 --> 47:19.400]  backblaze.com slash the talk show.
[47:19.400 --> 47:20.860]  They'll know where you came from.
[47:20.860 --> 47:24.300]  It'll support the show and you get a full featured
[47:24.300 --> 47:28.620]  15 day no credit card required trial.
[47:28.620 --> 47:29.460]  I use them.
[47:29.460 --> 47:31.540]  I've been using them for, I don't know, like 10 years.
[47:31.540 --> 47:32.740]  My thanks to them.
[47:32.740 --> 47:34.900]  All right, Dynamic Island time.
[47:34.900 --> 47:37.740]  So it's why I'm here, man.
[47:37.740 --> 47:38.860]  I'm playing with it right now
[47:38.860 --> 47:40.220]  while you're reading these ads just to.
[47:40.220 --> 47:42.420]  Oh, I love the Dynamic Island.
[47:42.420 --> 47:43.260]  It's pretty fun.
[47:43.260 --> 47:44.240]  I liked your take on it.
[47:44.240 --> 47:46.500]  I think you're underestimating it already though.
[47:46.500 --> 47:48.580]  I think it's already so super useful.
[47:48.580 --> 47:49.780]  I think you get it.
[47:49.780 --> 47:51.180]  I'm not saying you're wrong.
[47:51.180 --> 47:56.080]  I just still think you're ever so slightly missing
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.100]  how genius it is.
[47:57.100 --> 47:58.920]  So okay, my take just for the audience.
[47:58.920 --> 48:00.300]  I mean, you should obviously go read my review.
[48:00.300 --> 48:01.900]  Stop listening to this podcast, go read my review,
[48:01.900 --> 48:02.720]  watch the video, it's great.
[48:02.720 --> 48:05.500]  My take on it is basically connected to my feelings
[48:05.500 --> 48:06.420]  about live activities.
[48:06.420 --> 48:10.060]  That Apple's building this cool system
[48:10.060 --> 48:13.680]  that will allow more apps to sort of talk to you ambiently.
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.260]  And the Dynamic Island, it's the pinnacle of that system.
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.820]  I mean, the tech behind it is cool.
[48:21.820 --> 48:23.780]  The sub pixel anti-aliasing is cool.
[48:23.780 --> 48:26.940]  It really does look like a secondary display
[48:26.940 --> 48:29.580]  on top of your display, unless you're in sunlight.
[48:29.580 --> 48:32.700]  But fine, physics has some limits.
[48:32.700 --> 48:34.500]  So I think that part's really cool.
[48:34.500 --> 48:38.220]  I think as you experience it today,
[48:39.780 --> 48:43.100]  it is like most of the things that you're doing on it
[48:43.100 --> 48:45.060]  are things that you don't interact with.
[48:45.060 --> 48:48.300]  That to me is a good, that's the road
[48:48.300 --> 48:49.620]  that has to be gone down.
[48:49.620 --> 48:50.720]  Let me say this though.
[48:50.720 --> 48:54.240]  Let me just take a moment and no joke, no sarcasm
[48:54.240 --> 48:57.540]  to tell people to go read Eli's review.
[48:57.540 --> 49:01.600]  But really, honestly, here's where I get
[49:01.600 --> 49:03.320]  to undermine you slightly.
[49:03.320 --> 49:08.320]  Go watch the video review because that's where you capture
[49:08.580 --> 49:13.580]  the crazy sub pixel anti-aliasing stuff that they're doing
[49:16.100 --> 49:17.860]  to make it super smooth.
[49:17.860 --> 49:21.300]  Even at like 460 pixels per inch on the display,
[49:21.300 --> 49:25.580]  they're actually sub pixel anti-aliasing
[49:25.580 --> 49:28.720]  the round black corners of the dynamic island
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.620]  to make them even smoother, which I wish,
[49:31.620 --> 49:34.780]  oh, this is one of those times where I really wish
[49:34.780 --> 49:38.740]  I had my eyes from 20 years ago
[49:38.740 --> 49:40.180]  because I know I'd notice it.
[49:40.180 --> 49:41.860]  And it's like, I'm too old.
[49:41.860 --> 49:43.740]  My eyes have gone through too much shit.
[49:43.740 --> 49:45.120]  Like I could see that it looks beautiful,
[49:45.120 --> 49:46.820]  but I can't tell that they're doing that.
[49:46.820 --> 49:48.700]  But I love that they're doing it.
[49:48.700 --> 49:53.700]  Well, Apple cares more about corners on displays
[49:53.700 --> 49:57.780]  than any company in the history of the world, I think.
[49:57.780 --> 50:00.460]  So on the LCD iPhones, when I saw those,
[50:00.460 --> 50:02.820]  the liquid retina branding was just
[50:02.820 --> 50:05.220]  that it was a round LCD display
[50:05.220 --> 50:07.300]  and they had built special little apertures
[50:07.300 --> 50:10.900]  for the pixels in the corners to make them perfectly round.
[50:10.900 --> 50:11.860]  That was a whole branding.
[50:11.860 --> 50:12.940]  They branded the whole thing
[50:12.940 --> 50:14.300]  because they were so proud of it.
[50:14.300 --> 50:18.140]  They've done OLED sub pixel anti-aliasing for years
[50:18.140 --> 50:21.020]  on the static corners of the display.
[50:21.020 --> 50:22.680]  And then the island, they talked about it.
[50:22.680 --> 50:27.580]  They have built the ability inside the A16
[50:27.580 --> 50:29.820]  to now do that sub pixel anti-aliasing
[50:29.820 --> 50:32.340]  at 120 frames per second, 120 Hertz.
[50:32.340 --> 50:34.460]  So that is just cool.
[50:34.460 --> 50:37.740]  I will appreciate that about Apple more than anything.
[50:37.740 --> 50:38.740]  I always have.
[50:38.740 --> 50:39.660]  They care about displays.
[50:39.660 --> 50:42.000]  They care about this level of displays.
[50:42.000 --> 50:43.120]  And so whenever I have a chance
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.740]  to point a macro lens at a screen,
[50:45.740 --> 50:47.100]  I'm gonna take it.
[50:48.560 --> 50:49.980]  I'm always gonna take that shot.
[50:49.980 --> 50:51.500]  Give me the opportunity, I'll do it.
[50:51.500 --> 50:52.400]  And so here it's cool.
[50:52.400 --> 50:54.680]  It's hard to see, you have to really see it,
[50:54.680 --> 50:57.580]  but no one else is doing this like this.
[50:57.580 --> 51:01.100]  Even the rest of iOS, the anti-aliasing
[51:01.100 --> 51:05.420]  is abstracted out to the symbolic pixel level,
[51:05.420 --> 51:07.140]  not the actual hardware sub pixels.
[51:07.140 --> 51:08.260]  Right.
[51:08.260 --> 51:10.780]  Yeah, and I think you nailed it exactly right
[51:10.780 --> 51:15.460]  in your review, and it is exactly like the way
[51:15.460 --> 51:18.540]  they put this inordinate attention
[51:18.540 --> 51:22.780]  into the actual round corners of the display
[51:22.780 --> 51:27.260]  to go to the greatest possible length that they can
[51:27.260 --> 51:29.420]  to make it seem like the display
[51:29.420 --> 51:32.460]  actually has perfectly round corners,
[51:32.460 --> 51:35.620]  which is not the way displays work and can't work.
[51:35.620 --> 51:39.060]  Right, there are no rounded, round cornered pixels
[51:39.060 --> 51:42.380]  up in the corner, but they'll go to this length
[51:42.380 --> 51:45.060]  of actually going to sub pixel anti-aliasing
[51:45.060 --> 51:48.380]  even though the actual pixels are so tiny
[51:48.380 --> 51:51.520]  to make the hardware display look like it actually
[51:51.520 --> 51:54.060]  has the round corners that it's supposed to.
[51:54.060 --> 51:56.820]  And in that exact same way, they're doing sub pixel
[51:56.820 --> 51:59.060]  anti-aliasing with the dynamic island
[51:59.060 --> 52:02.900]  to make it seem like it's a hardware cutout
[52:02.900 --> 52:05.400]  that grows and shrinks and has content.
[52:06.580 --> 52:07.640]  Yeah, I mean, it's cool.
[52:07.640 --> 52:09.180]  It's just cool as hell.
[52:09.180 --> 52:12.340]  Like I'm saying, I think the concept is there.
[52:12.340 --> 52:14.920]  I think you are confident that a year from now
[52:14.920 --> 52:18.060]  it will realize its promise, and my nature,
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.580]  I think at this point people have heard us
[52:19.580 --> 52:21.780]  talk about it many years in a row,
[52:21.780 --> 52:23.500]  my nature is let's wait and see.
[52:23.500 --> 52:26.500]  Like you gotta ship the API, the developers gotta use it.
[52:26.500 --> 52:29.100]  We have to, Apple's gotta make sure that Uber
[52:29.100 --> 52:30.380]  doesn't like stick ads in it.
[52:30.380 --> 52:33.180]  Like there's a lot to come here.
[52:33.180 --> 52:36.740]  And so I'm just more on the wait and see side of things.
[52:36.740 --> 52:40.500]  My take is that even if, I think the potential,
[52:40.500 --> 52:42.860]  it still hasn't reached the full potential,
[52:42.860 --> 52:45.860]  but where it is today, where I've been using it
[52:45.860 --> 52:48.260]  for the last week, even if it didn't get any better,
[52:48.260 --> 52:51.000]  it's already something I would never wanna go without.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.020]  Here's my example.
[52:52.020 --> 52:54.980]  I was in New York two days ago,
[52:54.980 --> 52:57.940]  and I know my way around Midtown,
[52:57.940 --> 53:02.940]  but I had to meet a friend and some other people,
[53:02.960 --> 53:04.340]  and I didn't wanna be late.
[53:04.340 --> 53:07.020]  I had just enough time, so I took the walking directions.
[53:07.020 --> 53:09.220]  If I weren't testing the iPhone,
[53:09.220 --> 53:11.980]  would I really have needed walking directions?
[53:11.980 --> 53:14.540]  No, the numbers in Manhattan tell you where to go.
[53:14.540 --> 53:16.260]  But I was like, you know what, let me do this.
[53:16.260 --> 53:18.540]  Let me pretend like I need the walking direction.
[53:18.540 --> 53:21.020]  So that's slightly, what's the word?
[53:21.020 --> 53:23.740]  Constrained, not constrained, but construed?
[53:23.740 --> 53:24.780]  Artificial, yeah.
[53:24.780 --> 53:28.580]  But I was listening to podcast in Overcast,
[53:28.580 --> 53:32.020]  which has not been updated for the Dynamic Island
[53:32.020 --> 53:35.580]  because the APIs, there are no APIs for the Dynamic Island
[53:35.580 --> 53:38.580]  that are public yet, and Marco Arment obviously
[53:38.580 --> 53:39.740]  didn't know about it beforehand.
[53:39.740 --> 53:43.540]  So just using the regular version of Overcast
[53:43.540 --> 53:46.020]  that had no idea the Dynamic Island existed,
[53:46.020 --> 53:49.860]  but uses the now-playing APIs in iOS,
[53:49.860 --> 53:53.180]  and like a typical tech-obsessed,
[53:53.180 --> 53:54.540]  short attention span person,
[53:54.540 --> 53:56.760]  while I'm walking through Midtown Manhattan,
[53:56.760 --> 54:01.100]  I'm texting people and tweeting and reading Twitter
[54:01.100 --> 54:05.220]  on my phone, and I've got the live directions
[54:05.220 --> 54:08.940]  constantly up there as the, I've got two things.
[54:08.940 --> 54:12.500]  Now I'm actually using two things in the Dynamic Island,
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.180]  the live directions are, get the left side.
[54:16.180 --> 54:18.100]  When there's two things, one of them gets
[54:18.100 --> 54:20.860]  like the bigger chunk on the left side,
[54:20.860 --> 54:23.220]  and the other one just gets a little circle
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.700]  on the right side.
[54:24.700 --> 54:28.880]  That was Overcast, and I also did, I really did,
[54:28.880 --> 54:31.940]  this wasn't faked for the sense of dicking around
[54:31.940 --> 54:34.540]  with the Dynamic Island while I'm crossing
[54:34.540 --> 54:37.500]  certain streets and stuff, or something happens,
[54:37.500 --> 54:41.080]  or I got distracted while I was texting somebody,
[54:41.080 --> 54:43.760]  and I wanted to go back 30 seconds in the podcast
[54:43.760 --> 54:46.180]  because I actually sort of wasn't paying attention there.
[54:46.180 --> 54:49.060]  It just, there I am, long press on Overcast
[54:49.060 --> 54:51.940]  in the Dynamic Island, the now-playing,
[54:51.940 --> 54:54.260]  actual playback controls come down,
[54:54.260 --> 54:57.660]  I hit 30 seconds back, tap away, it goes back,
[54:57.660 --> 55:00.620]  and I'm there, and there's no context switching.
[55:00.620 --> 55:03.460]  I'm still, I never left messages.
[55:03.460 --> 55:06.220]  I'm still there in the messages conversation
[55:06.220 --> 55:08.520]  without leaving, it's no context switch.
[55:08.520 --> 55:12.420]  And oh, the turn-by-turn wants me to turn left
[55:12.420 --> 55:14.740]  to go, or turn right and go down Broadway.
[55:14.740 --> 55:19.740]  There, it's really useful as is without live activities yet,
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.760]  just with things like turn-by-turn, and the phone calls,
[55:25.760 --> 55:27.940]  and the now-playing, and the stuff
[55:27.940 --> 55:29.740]  that already just goes there.
[55:29.740 --> 55:32.540]  And it's a, to me, a real triumph.
[55:32.540 --> 55:36.700]  I've been skeptical about this whole movement towards,
[55:36.700 --> 55:41.060]  which what I think is best described as declarative UI,
[55:41.060 --> 55:43.260]  which is SwiftUI, and SwiftUI's one example
[55:43.260 --> 55:45.460]  of this movement towards declarative UI,
[55:45.460 --> 55:48.460]  which is instead of designing everything
[55:48.460 --> 55:51.820]  to be pixel perfect, and this is exactly
[55:51.820 --> 55:52.820]  what it's going to look like.
[55:52.820 --> 55:54.940]  It'll have a white background,
[55:54.940 --> 55:58.140]  and it will be exactly this size or this size.
[55:58.140 --> 56:00.320]  Here's the three exact sizes it'll be,
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.260]  and here's the exact layout.
[56:02.260 --> 56:04.220]  You just declare where stuff will be.
[56:04.220 --> 56:06.340]  This goes on the left, this goes on the right,
[56:06.340 --> 56:08.700]  and this is, it's just sort of midsize.
[56:08.700 --> 56:12.300]  Everything, without ever having known about it,
[56:12.300 --> 56:15.460]  the overcast playback controls look perfect,
[56:15.460 --> 56:17.500]  even though on the lock screen,
[56:17.500 --> 56:22.100]  which is what was known to be where now-playing stuff,
[56:22.100 --> 56:23.620]  like when you're listening to a podcast
[56:23.620 --> 56:26.560]  and you can still control it from your lock screen now,
[56:26.560 --> 56:28.620]  it has a white background, right?
[56:28.620 --> 56:30.580]  So it's a total different color scheme.
[56:31.460 --> 56:35.200]  No software, no software update necessary.
[56:35.200 --> 56:36.740]  It already just works.
[56:36.740 --> 56:39.200]  It's a terrific experience.
[56:40.660 --> 56:44.460]  Yeah, look, I'm not discounting that it's a good experience.
[56:44.460 --> 56:47.980]  I think what I'm saying is I think
[56:47.980 --> 56:50.560]  the point of the iPhone is apps,
[56:50.560 --> 56:54.620]  and when I am doing turn-by-turn directions,
[56:54.620 --> 56:57.540]  I'm most often in a car where I probably
[56:57.540 --> 57:01.260]  should not have another app open on my phone, right?
[57:01.260 --> 57:03.620]  I give the whole screen to that thing,
[57:03.620 --> 57:05.860]  and I did the walking directions test, too,
[57:05.860 --> 57:09.460]  and I was like, I shouldn't be using my phone like this.
[57:09.460 --> 57:11.220]  That's actually how I felt in that moment.
[57:11.220 --> 57:15.740]  Like, oh, I am contriving some sort of test
[57:15.740 --> 57:19.060]  to make this happen, and the moment
[57:19.060 --> 57:22.060]  when you've got that many things going on,
[57:22.060 --> 57:25.700]  it felt like the things that are available right now
[57:25.700 --> 57:29.260]  do not rise to, I need to have these three things going on.
[57:29.260 --> 57:34.040]  I could see, okay, there's a Packers game going on
[57:34.040 --> 57:34.980]  that I need to pay attention to,
[57:34.980 --> 57:36.620]  but I'm texting someone else,
[57:36.620 --> 57:39.400]  and I've got a timer going, because I'm cooking, right?
[57:39.400 --> 57:43.100]  Like, I can imagine the situation in my head,
[57:43.100 --> 57:45.400]  but I can't review it today.
[57:46.260 --> 57:48.620]  I really just think it's terrific,
[57:48.620 --> 57:52.540]  but the flip side, and this is where I,
[57:52.540 --> 57:53.660]  again, I haven't caught up,
[57:53.660 --> 57:55.580]  because I didn't publish till super late last night.
[57:55.580 --> 57:57.680]  I've read your review, I've read Joanna's.
[57:57.680 --> 58:00.820]  I don't, again, I'm not trying to toot my own horn.
[58:00.820 --> 58:03.060]  Maybe I'm off in left field,
[58:03.060 --> 58:05.500]  but I spent a lot of time in my review
[58:05.500 --> 58:08.420]  talking about the fact that all of these cool things,
[58:08.420 --> 58:11.780]  you can't do them, and you're not going to be able
[58:11.780 --> 58:13.900]  to do them on any other phones
[58:13.900 --> 58:16.040]  except the 14 Pro and Pro Max.
[58:16.040 --> 58:20.300]  Not the 13 Pro, if you bought a 13 Pro last year
[58:20.300 --> 58:24.140]  for $1,500 or $1,600, you don't get it,
[58:24.140 --> 58:29.140]  and if you buy a brand new iPhone 14, not Pro, this year,
[58:29.500 --> 58:31.140]  and you can get them,
[58:31.140 --> 58:33.500]  I forget how much they cost with 512 megabytes.
[58:33.500 --> 58:36.380]  They're like $1,400 or 1,300.
[58:36.380 --> 58:38.980]  They're in the same, well into the same price range
[58:38.980 --> 58:41.960]  as the Pro models with lower storage.
[58:41.960 --> 58:43.660]  You don't get this at all.
[58:43.660 --> 58:46.220]  You do get it on the lock screen, right?
[58:46.220 --> 58:48.820]  You'll get live activities on the lock screen,
[58:48.820 --> 58:50.980]  and you will get live activities
[58:50.980 --> 58:55.440]  when whatever is providing the live activity
[58:55.440 --> 58:57.640]  decides to send you an update,
[58:57.640 --> 58:58.940]  and the best example of that
[58:58.940 --> 59:01.160]  is one we're already familiar with
[59:01.160 --> 59:03.980]  is Maps turn-by-turn directions,
[59:03.980 --> 59:06.340]  which has worked like that for years already,
[59:06.340 --> 59:08.980]  where while you're using the phone
[59:08.980 --> 59:13.340]  and Maps wants you to turn left on whatever street,
[59:13.340 --> 59:17.180]  it pops up at the top as a panel
[59:17.180 --> 59:18.840]  and tells you to do that,
[59:18.840 --> 59:22.580]  but you don't tell Maps, hey, tell me what I'm doing again
[59:22.580 --> 59:24.300]  and show that panel.
[59:24.300 --> 59:28.920]  It comes up on its own, and you also can't keep it there.
[59:28.920 --> 59:30.300]  It's fleeting.
[59:30.300 --> 59:31.640]  I don't know what the timeout is,
[59:31.640 --> 59:33.900]  but it's like five seconds or something like that,
[59:33.900 --> 59:37.100]  and no matter what you do, it's going to disappear.
[59:37.100 --> 59:41.960]  That's the experience every other iPhone is going to have,
[59:41.960 --> 59:45.600]  where you either go to the lock screen to see these things,
[59:45.600 --> 59:49.480]  or you wait for the thing to send you an update,
[59:49.480 --> 59:52.400]  whereas iPhone 14 Pro users
[59:52.400 --> 59:54.300]  have them up there in a dynamic island,
[59:54.300 --> 59:58.380]  and every time they want to expand or compact them,
[59:58.380 --> 59:59.360]  it's up to them.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.660]  That is bananas to me in a way.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.540]  I know why Apple did it this way.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:08.500]  I get it, but I can't remember
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.900]  in all my years of using the Mac.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.260]  There's never been something like that on the Mac,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.580]  where if you have a years-old Mac,
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.880]  but you're using the newest version of Mac OS,
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.080]  it may not look as cool,
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.260]  but there's no major interaction feature
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:30.180]  that only the users of the latest MacBook Pro get.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.100]  I can think of one, but we all hated it was the touch bar.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.820]  Yeah, but even that wasn't,
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.340]  that was, but that was literally hardware.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.700]  That's true, that is true.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.660]  I guess that Apple wants to think of this as hardware,
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.020]  so that's why my mind leaps to it.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.780]  Yeah, the touch bar's a good example.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.460]  It's the closest they ever got with the Mac,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.620]  but it was literal hardware,
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.740]  and I'll just put it in as an asterisk
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.780]  that I didn't hate it, I just didn't love it.
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.300]  I was like the weirdo who was totally ambivalent about it.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.620]  I was not.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.580]  Most of the guests, most of my regular guests on this show
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.100]  are on your side, and so I always say it in a small voice,
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.340]  because I feel so clearly on the wrong side
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.780]  of people whose opinion I trust
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.700]  that I suspect my ambivalence is wrong.
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.380]  I know some people will love it, but not me.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.820]  Here's what I'll say, I think that's actually maybe fine.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.500]  So the genius of this whole island
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.940]  is that it is an extension of Live Activities,
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.020]  which we have yet to see.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.900]  But also now playing, also Call Kit, also.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.380]  Yeah, but all that stuff is kind of rolling into it,
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.540]  from my understanding.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.820]  Like, this is the stuff as it works now.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.020]  There's some incoming call stuff, right?
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.100]  Like, Call Kit can use it,
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.120]  but when Live Activities rolls out,
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.300]  those apps will get a kind of,
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.940]  like third-party apps will get a better version
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:40.820]  of incoming calls.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.940]  So they're basically taking all these alerts and indicators
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.660]  that just sort of populate the top of your screen,
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.900]  they're combining them with Live Activities,
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.940]  and they're building this new alert system,
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.060]  which I think is very smart.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.060]  Like, I said this in the review,
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.740]  I love the name Dynamic Island,
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.860]  because everyone wants to say it,
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.440]  and then I get to, but then I get to just talk about,
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.060]  like, the nature and philosophy of smartphone alerts.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.540]  Yes, yes.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.020]  And like, I get to talk about that with you,
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.140]  and I thought, Joanna.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.680]  And like, not so many other people,
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.380]  but now other people are like, Dynamic Island,
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.220]  and I'm like, let me tell you
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.460]  about the nature and philosophy of smartphone alerts.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.540]  So that's great for me, personally.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.580]  But developers have to buy into it.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.340]  They've gotta use it.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.420]  And so if you build the Live Activity,
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.960]  my understanding of it is,
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.180]  you basically just have to make one other view
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.540]  for the widget.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.540]  The actual logic of it, the API usage,
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.220]  even most of the display,
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.360]  is like, the same.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.860]  You just have to build this other view,
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.300]  and then this other minimal view,
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.080]  where you go down to just the icon.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.060]  That's genius, right?
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.820]  Like, it's fundamentally genius
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.360]  that Apple's like, leveraging it up
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.220]  all the way to the island.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.100]  So I think a year from now,
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.980]  when the island comes to the iPhone,
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.820]  regular iPhone 15, or even two years from now,
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.980]  the massive users that buy those.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.260]  I don't know this.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.660]  I'm not using any little birdie info.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.600]  I'm only speculating on how important this is
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.120]  to the marketing behind the Pro.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.740]  It won't be next year.
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.260]  Sure, but by the time it does trickle down
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.280]  to the mainstream phone,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.140]  like, the developer and app ecosystem
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.420]  will be ready for the mass audience
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.980]  to get immediate value.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.340]  Whereas right now, we're all kind of
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.940]  in early adopter stage of,
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.300]  how is everyone gonna use it?
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.480]  Like, does this make any sense?
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.700]  Like, let's tweet about it.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.340]  And I don't think that that makes sense
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.540]  for the mass audience.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.000]  Yeah, and the thing I'm wondering about is,
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.380]  so I think there's two reasons
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:42.700]  that Apple has made this an iPhone 14 Pro only feature.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.580]  Because, and I think I mentioned this in my review,
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.300]  that it's not too hard to imagine
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.420]  how they could have turned the notch
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.060]  into a dynamic peninsula.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.060]  And it wouldn't look as cool,
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.460]  but that they could do something with the interface
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.440]  to put these same things up there.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.140]  And like, when something's going on,
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.300]  like, remember when the notch first came out
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.120]  and there were a lot of people, a lot of people,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.940]  it was very, super controversial.
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.160]  Because the idea wasn't that you shouldn't make screens
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.960]  that go edge to edge, it's that, okay,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.500]  but if you've still gotta put the sensors up there,
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.080]  and you're using OLED, which has these super black blacks
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.860]  that really, except in really direct sunlight,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:26.300]  disguise, could disguise the notch.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.140]  That what Apple should have done
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:32.360]  is sort of draw a black bar across the top,
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.780]  and then draw the nice round corners,
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.720]  and just make it look like,
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.500]  and then you could put the status stuff,
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.940]  like your carrier name and your WiFi signal,
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.500]  and the time, put it up there in the black area,
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.840]  but then the notch wouldn't look like a notch,
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.340]  it would just look like the phone
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.420]  has a little black forehead,
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.020]  and magically, this white text with the time
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:59.220]  and the carrier and the signal strength could go up there.
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:01.140]  A lot of people wish that Apple did that.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.160]  There used to be a little temporary,
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.180]  while people were really annoyed by the notch,
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:08.780]  there was a cottage industry of apps to make wallpapers,
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.540]  so that you could have a real wallpaper,
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.700]  but the top of the wallpaper would be black,
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.340]  so that you'd get that sort of faked.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:19.540]  You could imagine that Apple could do that in iOS 16
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.980]  for the notched phones when
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.100]  the dynamic island stuff is happening
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.520]  on the notched phones,
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.660]  and something would happen where the whole bar
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.600]  would go black and they'd draw some stuff on the left
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.940]  and some stuff on the right,
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.780]  and you'd press and hold,
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.260]  and it wouldn't look as cool,
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.260]  and from a not talking about money perspective,
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.740]  Apple being Apple doesn't like,
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.260]  they're much more of a,
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.140]  you either get the absolute best experience,
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.420]  or you don't get it at all.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.140]  That's the Apple way of thinking,
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.700]  and that's why dynamic island is only on the actual phone
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.780]  that can do the dynamic island,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.420]  and you don't get any of these features
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.860]  while you're not on the lock screen
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.380]  using the phone on all the other iPhones.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.660]  Now, talking about money,
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.020]  this is the thing,
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.780]  all the commercials I saw watching football last weekend
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.440]  for the iPhone 14 were about the dynamic island,
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.740]  and I know they're gonna have a whole,
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.300]  I already looked at their YouTube channel.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.180]  There are other commercials they've already launched,
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.500]  and they're gonna sell other things,
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.900]  and they're gonna make commercials
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.620]  for the regular iPhone 14s.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.060]  Dynamic island is so cool
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.180]  that they're making commercials about it,
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.660]  like 60-second spots just about dynamic island.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.740]  They're using it,
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.860]  and my philosophy,
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.460]  this is what I kind of tailed off my review,
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.000]  is that it's not a coincidence
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.020]  that it's debuting the same year
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.900]  that they came out with the first non-pro phone
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.180]  with the giant 6.7 screen,
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:54.500]  because that used to be a thing that they would say,
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.060]  oh, you want a giant screen?
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.580]  And everybody knows a lot of people
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.140]  really love giant screen phones,
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.380]  and they're like, oh, well,
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.680]  let me tell you about this year's iPhone,
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.700]  whatever the number is, Pro,
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.340]  which starts at $1,100,
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.560]  because that's what you need to spend
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.960]  if you want it on iPhone.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.380]  Okay, now they've made it for all the iPhone 14,
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.320]  and obviously, next year, the iPhone 14 will still be here,
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.780]  and it'll be $100 less,
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.700]  and then I think two years from now,
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.180]  they'll still keep the iPhone 14 Plus,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:29.580]  and you'd be able to get a 6.7-inch screen iPhone
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.820]  for 700 bucks.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.980]  Oh, that'll be fascinating.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.740]  I don't know, we'll see.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.900]  Well, it'll definitely be here next year.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.260]  Will they keep it for two years?
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.100]  I don't know,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.740]  because sometimes two years down the road,
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.620]  they kind of spitefully only keep the smallest one
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.700]  with the least amount of storage or something like that.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.700]  I wouldn't be surprised if they keep it for two years.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.340]  If they're just like, for this number of years,
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:55.340]  we're gonna hold the max screen size as a Pro-only feature,
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:00.420]  and starting in 2022, okay, max size screen, you're free.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.520]  We're gonna call you Plus on the other phones,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.500]  but now you're free,
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.780]  and we'll just let you propagate down the line,
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.540]  and we'll make as many people who want that size happy
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.060]  no matter what their budget is,
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:13.080]  as long as their budget meets the admittedly
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.500]  relatively high cost of even the iPhone SE, right,
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.540]  compared to the market overall.
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.900]  My most enduring theory of consumer electronics
[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.980]  is that big, cheap screens drive the world.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.460]  Yes, definitely, right.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.420]  If you just find the biggest, cheapest screen,
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.820]  that's the thing most people wanna buy.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.780]  I guarantee you, if you and I just wandered into,
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.780]  with a Verge crew and shot a video
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.500]  and talked to somebody in a Best Buy,
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.000]  they'd be like, oh yeah, yeah, everybody comes in,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.460]  and they're just like, oh, give me the biggest,
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.500]  cheapest screen you got.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.820]  Oh yeah, no, this is especially true in TVs,
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.780]  where it's like, do you want a 55-inch beautiful OLED,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.300]  or do you want the world's shittiest 85-inch TV?
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.740]  And everyone's like, the 85-inch TV.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.760]  Yeah, they're like, that shittiest 85-inch TV costs what?
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.940]  And they're like, oh, it's this,
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.740]  and they're like, oh, give me that.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.420]  Yeah, it's always like $500.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.180]  It's like, do you, okay, fine,
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.340]  and everyone buys that TV,
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.540]  and that's like, I think that it's true of laptops.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.380]  There's a reason that crap 15-inch Windows laptops
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.460]  still sell numbers,
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.220]  because they're just big and cheap.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.260]  And I think that has finally arrived
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.740]  to the iPhone in some way.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.860]  I'm not saying it's crappy,
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.500]  but the iPhone 14 Plus is just, I think,
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.860]  a recognition that the iPhone 13 Mini was great,
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.940]  and everyone loved it,
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.280]  but what consumers really want
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.540]  when they pull out their wallets is a big, cheap screen.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.640]  Yep, yeah, so I don't think it's a coincidence.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.380]  So they let go of this one thing,
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.020]  which was a pro-only motivator,
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.780]  and now they've got this new thing, the Dynamic Island.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.420]  And I don't think it's gonna be pro-only forever,
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.740]  but I think it's going to be three years, maybe,
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.100]  maybe four, I don't know.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.900]  It really, I could imagine it being four years.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.040]  But I think when stuff hits that audience,
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.980]  it has to be ready.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:59.140]  And I think our title was like,
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.940]  it's the early adopter island or something.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.860]  Like, there's a lot of stuff in these pros
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.000]  that are the beginnings of ideas,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.020]  whereas the 14 is so complete, it's just the 13 again.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.820]  And so I think when you hit that part of the market,
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.820]  the ideas have to be finished,
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.340]  everyone has to know the limit.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.300]  There's no room for error,
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.500]  because no one's coming on your podcast
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.860]  to spend two hours talking about sub-pixel and aliasing.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.860]  Whereas I think in the pro market and with that audience,
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.460]  everyone keeps saying that the pre-orders
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.660]  for the pro are higher than,
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.100]  and it's like, yeah, they're definitionally early adopters.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.340]  But let me interrupt you there.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.180]  I don't buy that at all.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.060]  Who the hell at this point knows anything
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.580]  about the pre-orders outside Apple and Tim Cook's office?
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.500]  I saw Ming-Chi Kuo's post about it,
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.340]  and I don't know him, I've never met him,
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.560]  and I'm a fan, he obviously gets a lot of stuff right.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.260]  But his post about that was, I don't know,
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.020]  I mean, he was high as a kite or something,
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.380]  because he even put stuff in that was nonsense.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:05.980]  He said in his checks that the 14 plus
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.940]  was going to be in wide availability on launch day.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.620]  Apple told us at the keynote
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:13.620]  it's not available till October 7th.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.020]  What the hell is he talking about?
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.820]  We didn't even get them to review
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.180]  because it's coming out so late, so much later.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:23.940]  Again, so late, October 7th, it's not that late.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.940]  But I'm saying, but you know and I know
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:28.500]  that Apple does not seed review unit products
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.040]  more than, almost never more than a week in advance
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.260]  of availability.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.100]  And-
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.140]  In this case, less than a week.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.020]  And sometimes two weeks,
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.780]  not that I know anything about that,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.500]  but sometimes two weeks.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.340]  But in my experience, never more than two weeks,
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:48.980]  except the one and only exception to that,
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:50.540]  which I guess we can now talk about
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.520]  would be the original AirPods.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.360]  Yeah.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.220]  Way back in like 2016.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.180]  And they were like beta.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.980]  Yeah, and they told us these are actually
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.700]  last stage prototypes.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.480]  I guess prototypes may be the wrong word.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:09.080]  Pre-production, these are last stage pre-production units.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.280]  And then when the actual AirPods shipped
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.060]  like a month or six weeks later,
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.940]  that was like the first and ever only review unit product
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:19.220]  where they immediately called me and said,
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.680]  we would like you to send those back today.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.580]  And we've got a box, we've got a FedEx guy
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.780]  coming to your house now to pick them up.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.220]  Yeah, and it was a weird exception.
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:32.220]  So the plus, Ming-Chi Kuo saying that the plus
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:34.660]  was gonna be in wide availability on launch day,
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.540]  which is today, the day you and I are talking,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.980]  is I don't know what the hell he's talking about.
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:42.360]  But meanwhile, because Ming-Chi Kuo said it,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.060]  it's all over the world that the iPhone 14 regulars
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.060]  are not in demand and the 14 Pro Max is in high demand
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.940]  and 14 Pro is in medium demand.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.980]  And you look at his methodology, it's crazy.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.300]  His sources are clearly all in the supply chain
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.620]  and he gets great information out of them.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.620]  I mean, nobody else is quite like Ming-Chi Kuo
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.920]  in terms of information from the supply chain.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.880]  But in terms of knowing the launch day pre-orders,
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.980]  whatever Apple is going to do to adjust
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.340]  their supply chain orders hasn't happened yet.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.500]  So I think that's nonsense.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.200]  I don't think anybody outside Tim Cook's office
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.220]  knows anything about which phones
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.460]  have been ordered how many times.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.100]  By that quote, also, he reached, he was like,
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.780]  he arrived at a conclusion that makes no sense to me.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.580]  He was like, this product segmentation strategy is a fail.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.900]  It's like, I have no idea.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:36.740]  He definitely has no idea.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:37.580]  Like, what are you doing?
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:41.200]  But all I meant was the people citing that to me
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.100]  is evidence that my big, cheap screens theory is wrong.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.940]  It's like, no, no, no.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.620]  The early adopters are always gonna find a problem.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.260]  Even if you believe this or don't believe it,
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.500]  nothing about pre-order data tells you what is gonna happen.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.940]  It's definitionally early adopters.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.780]  Who's buying a phone to actually go
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.500]  and pick up on Friday the 16th
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.180]  so that they can have it in the morning
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.080]  on the first day that it's available?
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.080]  Who, back 10 years ago, was lined up
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.220]  outside their local Apple store on Friday morning
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.540]  at six in the morning, three hours before the store opened
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.860]  so that they could get one?
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.140]  It's early adopters.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.900]  And what are they gonna buy?
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.200]  People like that aren't gonna buy a mid-range phone.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.040]  And then vice versa, who's going to be buying
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.040]  a brand new iPhone 14-something next August, right?
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.620]  It's the people who don't care.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:43.520]  And you could tell them.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.380]  You could say, hey, Apple's probably coming out
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.740]  with new phones in two weeks.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.660]  And they'd be like, yeah, I don't need them.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.100]  I don't care, right?
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.140]  And you know what they're gonna do?
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.300]  They're gonna walk in the store
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.420]  and they're gonna say, yeah, I love a big phone.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.780]  And they're like, well, you can get the Pro Max
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:01.780]  and it's 1100, or the regular Pro Plus, or 14 Plus,
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.140]  and it's 900, and they'll be like, 900?
[01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.540]  Yeah, that's the one I want.
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.660]  Yeah, I mean, we'll see.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:13.100]  Like I said, my theory is on a long enough timeline,
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.860]  the big, cheap screen always wins, right?
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.700]  And it's just sort of true,
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.460]  and the screens keep getting bigger and cheaper
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.740]  so everyone's happy.
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.780]  I don't think, and I was, I'm not always right.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:26.020]  I was obvious, my personal taste
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.420]  in relatively smaller phones.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.380]  And again, I never actually bought a Mini,
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.180]  although I think I might have two years ago
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.300]  if I had been younger and my eyes were better.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.340]  But I did buy, that was the year I didn't buy the Pro.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.140]  I bought the regular iPhone 12
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.700]  because I just thought the 12 Pro,
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.620]  I wasn't impressed by the camera
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.380]  and thought in the fall of 2020,
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.300]  I'm not going anywhere for a while.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.300]  This COVID thing is clearly here all winter.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.860]  Why do I need a camera for?
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.420]  I'll buy the one that's lighter
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.860]  and that I think feels better in my hand.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.540]  I thought, maybe I should just get the Mini,
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.740]  but I really, it's like, I'm almost 50.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.020]  I need the bigger screen.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:09.700]  But to me, the 6.1 in size is a little too big.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.380]  But I get it.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:16.380]  My taste in smaller phones had me off the trail
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:20.420]  of the Android side racing ahead to truly,
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.420]  what we used to call them, phablets, right?
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:23.420]  Yep.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.220]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a Max phone person
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.380]  and this thing's a phablet.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.220]  Right.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.260]  It's this close to being seven inches.
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.300]  Yeah, I was wrong about that, clearly.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.660]  And it's obvious in hindsight.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.740]  I remember the first time I had to do something
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.420]  in a Verizon store, easily 10 years ago.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:44.420]  And it was before Apple had really big phones,
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.900]  the plus ones, right?
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.820]  So, and when it came out in the Samsung trial,
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.740]  like wasn't it a Phil Schiller email
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.820]  that people want big screen phones that we don't make,
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.180]  something like that, you know.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:58.260]  And Tim Cook was like, just do it, stop it.
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:03.140]  And the problem is, and if you look at that email
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.780]  compared to when Apple started shipping
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:08.260]  the bigger plus size phones,
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.140]  that's all the proof you need of how long it takes Apple
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.380]  to go from, okay, we'll make this phone
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.420]  to it's September, here it is.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.740]  It's over two years.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.380]  They don't all, anytime you see a story that, you know,
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.860]  like that Apple's making a major change
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.500]  to next year's iPhone, it's complete nonsense.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.380]  It just can't work that way.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.140]  But I remember being in a Verizon store,
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.060]  something to do with my SIM card, I don't know.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.500]  I had something wrong with my account.
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:38.260]  And I heard a customer shopping for an Android phone
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.780]  and her boyfriend was trying to talk her
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.700]  into one that had a pen for something.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.220]  And she knew what she wanted.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.740]  She wanted, and she was a very small Asian woman
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.140]  and she had a tiny purse.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.380]  I remember looking at her purse thing.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:55.420]  How are you even gonna put that phone?
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.500]  She went right to the one that was the biggest.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.700]  She was like, no, no, I want the,
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.500]  I forget what model number it was.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.220]  But it was the Samsung something with the biggest screen.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.940]  And he was like, are you sure that's huge?
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.500]  And he was like trying to talk her out of it.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.820]  And she was like, nope.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.220]  And sold, here, take my credit card.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.180]  Meanwhile, she's got the phone and is out of the store
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.500]  and they're still dicking around
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.460]  with my SIM card problem, of course.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.900]  But I just remember that was the moment,
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.260]  I remember the moment and I thought, you know what?
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.020]  I'm wrong about these phones.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.380]  People, all sorts of people want them,
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.980]  including very small, short people
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.180]  who carry very small purses.
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.100]  They're gonna squeeze it into the purse and make it work.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.820]  I bought my mama a Mac size phone.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.580]  She is herself a small Asian woman.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.900]  She loves it, can't get enough of it.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.780]  So I think the 14 Plus is gonna sell like gangbusters.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.860]  And I think Apple knows it.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.100]  There's certain things that they never know.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.620]  I've talked to people over the years, like Apple says,
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:54.820]  people think we know everything
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.500]  and how many of each thing is gonna be sold.
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.660]  And we're always surprised every year.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.700]  We're surprised by which colors are popular.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.100]  We're surprised by this and that.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.860]  But I think the one thing they know for sure
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:09.260]  is the 14 Plus is gonna sell like gangbusters.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.900]  Yeah, I think that's fair.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.060]  But anyway, back to the dynamic island.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.500]  Here's the thing.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.860]  No, but in terms of how they could have brought
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.300]  some of the features to the other phones,
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.260]  you mentioned in your review,
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.700]  there are things that we've known for years.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.020]  They've been in iOS for years.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.260]  So like you're, if you've got turn by turn directions
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.740]  or anything location tracking,
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.420]  you get a blue pill in the top left corner, right?
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.020]  If you have a phone call going on, you get a green pill.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.300]  And if you tap the pill,
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.660]  you jump to the app that's responsible for it, right?
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.580]  So now that we have these things
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.060]  and the dynamic island is out
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.020]  and it's very clear that they could make it
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.500]  so that you could long press the pill
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.420]  and get the little widget thing
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.060]  to appear right underneath it without the dynamic island.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:20:00.580]  This doesn't even, the fact that they're not doing that
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.580]  and they're not going to do that is,
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.620]  let's call it what it is.
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.420]  It's a software lock on the feature.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.420]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.260]  By the way, do you think the long press to open the widget
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:13.500]  and the tap to open the app is as backwards as I do?
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.580]  I, it did not, this is one of my,
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.180]  I have this in my notes to talk about on the podcast.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.340]  I'm glad you brought it up
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.140]  so that I can't ignore my notes and forget it.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.580]  That did not occur to me at all,
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.860]  but I was reading your review today
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.880]  because when I'm late with my reviews,
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:33.140]  I scrupulously avoid reading other people's reviews,
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:34.940]  both because I need to finish mine
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.660]  and it just seems like the right thing to do.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.500]  So I-
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.320]  Yeah, and then when you're done,
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.900]  when you publish, you read everyone else's furiously.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.140]  Right, and I read yours and that was one of the things
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.740]  I was like, oh, I'm so glad he's on my podcast today
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.740]  because that is a really interesting idea, right?
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.560]  So your idea is, the way it works right now
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.260]  is that you tap a thing in the dynamic island
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.780]  and it jumps you to that app.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.020]  So your podcast player's playing
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.940]  and you've got the little thing up there,
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:08.020]  the live waveforms, you tap it and you jump to Overcast
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.080]  or you jump to Apple Podcasts or you jump to Spotify.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.420]  And if you long press, you get the player.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.060]  You're saying that should be reversed.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.500]  I think it should absolutely be reversed.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:22.140]  If the idea of the island is that it's a hardware display
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:25.060]  that floats over the top of iOS,
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.980]  then you should use it more.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:30.540]  To me, a long press on a smartphone touch screen
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.440]  is effectively a right click.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:36.960]  And it's actually an even less discoverable right click.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:42.620]  So all the ads are like, the thing is moving.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.740]  Like the ads are great, right?
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.980]  But it's always opening and closing.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:45.820]  People are doing stuff with it.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:49.380]  And the point of it is not, oh, this is an app switcher
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.420]  with an animation on it.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.340]  The point of it is you're supposed to use it.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:55.620]  And the thing that drove me nuts was like,
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.460]  oh, I wanna use it.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.300]  I wanna open the thing and like change the track
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.540]  or I wanna see what the next name of the street is
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.300]  instead of just 900 feet or whatever it is.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:05.660]  I wanna stop this timer.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.380]  And you have to click and hold.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.380]  And it's just like, oh, this is backwards.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:13.840]  Like actually what I wanna do is use the island.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.700]  And if I wanna open the app,
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.220]  I will tell this phone that I wanna open the app
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:19.040]  in some way.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.460]  I'm not 100% convinced,
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:26.340]  but I'm over 50% convinced that you're right.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:27.380]  And-
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.800]  It should at least be a toggle.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.200]  They should at least let you choose.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.300]  Yeah.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.300]  Yeah.
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.140]  I don't know.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.980]  I almost think, I'm almost,
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:38.180]  I'm like at least 55% convinced
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.540]  that they shouldn't even be a toggle,
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.560]  that you're just right.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.140]  That tapping, if there is,
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.380]  if the app support has something that supports,
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.340]  I think everything that's in there does.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.360]  If it makes any sense to do it,
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.820]  then it should just show the expanded view on a tap.
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:54.660]  Right.
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.100]  And if there's no expanded view,
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.220]  like fine, kick me the app.
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.180]  Like I will understand.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.020]  Right.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.820]  And your analogy to a right click in Mac or Windows
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:03.240]  is exactly right.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.460]  And my philosophy,
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.500]  and I actually think everybody's Windows,
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.900]  the Windows guidelines, the Mac guidelines,
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:11.340]  I think all recommend this.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:14.500]  And over the years, of course,
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:18.020]  everybody can find examples of even software from Apple
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.860]  and Microsoft that disobeys it.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:24.420]  But the rules always been that nothing should be
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.740]  in the right click menu that you can only get
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:27.780]  in the right click menu.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:32.500]  There should be a way to do everything on the system
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.700]  with just regular clicks by moving the mouse somewhere
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.180]  on the screen to a visible element,
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:42.420]  be it a menu or an icon or something,
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.940]  and a regular click.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.020]  And maybe it takes three clicks, right,
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.640]  to go up to the menu and pull down the menu
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.180]  and down to a thing.
[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.820]  You should never have to do a right click
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.600]  because that's not discoverable
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.580]  because lots of people never right click anything.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:01.980]  And I do think it's a direct analogy to long pressing.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.940]  And for certain mice,
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:05.960]  obviously Apple mice don't have multiple buttons,
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.600]  but at least with like traditional mice,
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.800]  the right click button is a button
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.020]  that a normal person can see, right,
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:16.680]  and think, I don't know, what's that button do?
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.420]  And then they kind of can figure it out.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.500]  Long press is even less discoverable than right clicking
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.600]  because it's, I'm not sure people know they can do it.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.340]  And I do, I get it, right?
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.100]  And it's like, so you should be able
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.420]  to do it with a tap, right?
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.820]  So there is no way to just open the expanded view
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:40.080]  with just a tap, but according to my theory
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.960]  that like on a mouse system,
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.700]  you should be able to do everything with a regular click.
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:46.900]  You should be able to do everything with regular taps,
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.660]  even if it requires multiple taps.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.220]  So let's say you actually want to,
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:57.140]  you don't just want to open the little scoreboard thing
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:59.180]  for the live activity you're watching.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.140]  You actually want to switch to the ESPN app.
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:07.140]  Well, you tap it once to show the widget, an expanded view,
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.140]  and then you'd tap again to go to the app, right?
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.060]  Like it would be on,
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.660]  like there'd be like an ESPN logo in the widget
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.860]  and you'd tap that to go to the app.
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.140]  So you could still go to the app.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.860]  You would just have to tap and then tap,
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:24.620]  which isn't that different than the long tap, right?
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.760]  I think you're right.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.680]  And if you just think like,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.660]  I just want to open the expanded view, just tap it.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.060]  Tap it to expand it.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.020]  Especially because Apple is inundating everybody
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.980]  with marketing showing the thing happening all the time.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:42.980]  So it's like they're training users to expect a behavior.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:45.560]  That they may not discover even.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.140]  Right, and I obviously have like wandered around asking,
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:53.140]  the general vibe is we want it to be as simple as possible.
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.620]  And the simplest thing to do is kick you to the app.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.300]  And it's like, actually I still think that's backwards.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.780]  Yeah, I do too.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.900]  Cause I actually think the simplest thing that's possible
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.980]  is to open the mini app that's up there, right?
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.660]  Cause that's what these things are.
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.900]  They're little mini apps.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:12.140]  I compared them in my review to the iTunes mini player.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.380]  And I loved the iTunes.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.460]  I know I still call it iTunes cause,
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.800]  but the music app mini player, right?
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.340]  But over the years when I've been playing music on my Mac,
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.220]  my controlling it has gone through the mini player
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.740]  way more than iTunes,
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.420]  because you just leave the mini player up
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.720]  and it's wonderfully simple.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.540]  Now you've, and it forces the designer
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.620]  or designers of the app to reduce the app
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:42.660]  to its purest core.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:47.660]  Fast forward, reverse, play, pause, next,
[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.740]  and what's playing right now.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:52.740]  That's the app.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:53.580]  That's the core.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.860]  And yes, we want all these other features.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:58.460]  We want playlist management and we want radio stations
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:01.900]  and we want subscription info and go to your account info
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.360]  and buy new music and all those other stuff.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:08.260]  But the core of the app is fast forward, reverse,
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:11.200]  play, pause, next, and what's playing right now.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.540]  And that's the mini player.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:15.020]  And that's what these views do to all these apps.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:17.180]  So to me, that's the simplest thing possible.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:20.340]  Like I've hailed, I've hailed the Lyft
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.620]  and I'm waiting for it to show.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.740]  This is one of my, I can't wait for this to be in NowPlane
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.260]  cause it are a dynamic island.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:29.300]  Cause this is me all the time.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:34.080]  I hail an Uber or Lyft and it says,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.540]  of course they always lie.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:38.220]  And they say, they say, oh, we could get you one.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:40.100]  We'll get you one in four minutes.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:41.620]  And I'm like, oh, that's great.
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:42.940]  But that's actually so quick.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:44.540]  I was actually gonna go to the bathroom.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:45.620]  I don't have my shoes on yet.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.660]  Well, I'll hail it.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.180]  And then it spins and spins.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.220]  And then of course they're like, oh, it'll be nine minutes.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.180]  Right?
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.000]  Well, what am I gonna do?
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.780]  Now I've already gone to the bathroom.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.060]  I put my shoes on already cause I thought I,
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.660]  of course got suckered again, Lucy and the football
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.720]  thinking that the car was gonna be here
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.160]  in a couple of minutes.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.340]  Well, I'm gonna dick around on my phone of course, right?
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.180]  And this is what I do.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.140]  And then I'm on Twitter and then I'm all of a sudden,
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.540]  I'm like, wait, did I just spend 20 minutes on Twitter?
[01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.680]  Is the car outside?
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.100]  Did it already leave?
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.580]  I love the idea that in the dynamic island,
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.600]  I'll have a live update.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.740]  And every time I'm waiting for it, I can see it.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.940]  But I don't wanna jump to the app
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.260]  if I want more information,
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.820]  like to see what kind of car is it?
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.860]  Like that's, just let me tap it, right?
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.500]  Just let me tap it and see, okay,
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.800]  it's gonna be a red Tesla.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.580]  Yeah, and here's the last four of the license.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:36.420]  Yeah, here's the last four of the license.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.180]  This is the most important information of the whole app.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.460]  Right, just let me tap it.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.460]  And I don't want to,
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.580]  the last thing I wanna do is go to Uber's giant app
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.940]  with ads in it and all this crap.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.820]  Just let me see their mini player.
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:50.140]  Why was my first question,
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.140]  will Uber put ads in the dynamic island?
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.420]  Like there's a whole app review.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.500]  We're already like an hour and a half into it.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.620]  There's another hour and a half about app review
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.500]  for the dynamic island that is staring at us in the face.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.460]  Like this is why I'm like at wait and see.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.740]  Is Uber gonna put the Uber Eats logo
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.660]  in their dynamic island widget
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.100]  and try to get you to buy the Uber subscription
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.820]  in the dynamic, like,
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.380]  I kind of wanna know what that relationship
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.060]  between Apple and its developers and the,
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:22.640]  like when you say like what,
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:25.280]  when you reduce the app to its core essence,
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.720]  is the Instagram dynamic island widget
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.300]  just gonna show you an ad for like Instagram shirts?
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.460]  Like, I don't know.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.900]  No, they're gonna make you watch a reel.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.300]  They're definitely gonna make you watch a reel
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.140]  on the island.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.220]  Like I'm very curious to see how this plays out
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:42.060]  with developers,
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.460]  because that, the concepts they showed from Lyft
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:47.100]  and Flighty are like genius.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.020]  I'm in the airport.
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:50.240]  I just need to know the gate changed.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.940]  Just tell me the gate changed
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.220]  and like I'll move on
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.060]  and I don't need to open the American Airlines app,
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:56.900]  which is one of like,
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.260]  Apple should just kick that app out of the store.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:29:59.900]  If anyone from Apple is listening to me,
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.900]  just kick, just boot American Airlines out,
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.500]  make them start over.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.980]  So you get this whole world
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:09.180]  where there's all this sort of like ambient information
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.700]  and like you have to respect what it is
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:15.860]  and not use it as a way to shove your app into the island.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.980]  And I think there's a,
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.180]  this is why we might early adopter.
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.860]  It's like, we're gonna have to learn all together
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:22.700]  what works and what doesn't.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:25.420]  So I can be pretty cynical.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.680]  I can certainly be mean and sarcastic,
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.940]  but I have to admit that there's a,
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:36.940]  an optimist in me and excited by the opportunity designer
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:40.300]  mindset in me that never,
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.820]  you know, like the way that the best example of all time
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:48.340]  is email and the way that the original designers
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:51.100]  of internet email made it so simple.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.140]  And so, oh, you just, it's just,
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.800]  it's just a text file that you put,
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.460]  send over this port to a server
[01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.700]  and you just follow this format where you just put a to
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.700]  and from and all this stuff.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.760]  And it goes out and guess what?
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.800]  It's totally ripe for incredible abuse.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:14.540]  And we're all getting hundreds of spam messages a day still
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.380]  to this day.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.340]  And it'll never stop because the people who designed email
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:23.340]  never really thought, hey, wait, how could this be abused?
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.540]  It did not occur to me to think, wait,
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.460]  what are the things somebody could abuse
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:28.460]  the dynamic island for?
[01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:29.820]  So did you ask Apple?
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.580]  Will they be, are ads allowed?
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.420]  Did you ask?
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.240]  Well, as you may know,
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.100]  The Verge has a very strict background policy.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.500]  So I can't, unless they're going to be on the record.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.060]  You can't say what they said and if they didn't.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.900]  Well, so you can say whether you asked though.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.100]  I did ask, I 100% asked.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:51.980]  And I think I would characterize the response as,
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.180]  oh boy, we're going to have to wait and see.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.480]  Like, right, like they have app review.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.780]  They have a mechanism.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:01.300]  They have some guidelines, but no one has submitted apps yet.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.580]  Like, I don't, I don't know.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:07.380]  Like, is Spotify gonna put, like, try to break the rules
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.580]  and get you to sign up on the web in their island widget?
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.500]  Like, we're just going to have to find out
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.980]  because developers routinely push against rules
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:15.940]  and Apple pushes back.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.420]  And this is a way, like, my joke about American Airlines
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:21.820]  is they're going to, are they going to stick the offer
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.420]  for the American Airlines credit card
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:24.420]  in the island widget?
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.420]  Like, maybe.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.980]  Right, well, think about Spotify, right?
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:29.300]  So Spotify, you're playing Spotify,
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:32.540]  and now you're, and now you're doing your stuff.
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.460]  You're reading email, you're browsing the web,
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.580]  you're doing messages, and the Spotify thing
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:42.580]  is up there in the dynamic island, and there's an icon.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.060]  So they, if they can dynamically change that icon,
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:49.260]  they could change it to, like, a Chipotle icon, right?
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:53.940]  Right, I mean, I'm assuming that app review
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.260]  will catch a bunch of this stuff.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:58.100]  I'm assuming that people aren't going to want-
[01:32:58.100 --> 01:32:59.980]  They could just sell the icon, right?
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:02.260]  They could, that's just what I'm saying.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:04.420]  So we've, you know, and I'm not saying
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.740]  that all these companies are going to be nefarious.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:08.980]  I'm just saying that suddenly you have this ability
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.780]  to ambiently push information at people,
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.620]  and historically in the world,
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.900]  that ability has been used for advertising.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.060]  You're just listening to music,
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:22.500]  but you've got a Wendy's logo up.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.620]  Oh, no, but think about it this way.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.060]  You've got, so there's some prioritization happening
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:27.900]  with these apps.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:28.940]  You've only got two slots, right?
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.100]  There's the big one, and then if you got two at once,
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.380]  it turns into a little circle,
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.740]  which is like the ultra-minimal view.
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.140]  Yeah, there's three sizes.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.660]  One is if it's the one and only thing.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.900]  Then there's two sizes if there's two,
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.340]  and then there's the expanded view.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:47.140]  So four total sizes.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.980]  Yeah, and so you can just see, like,
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.500]  okay, there's an app that wants the island.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.420]  It's been de-prioritized.
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:56.340]  And the internal priority ranking of the apps
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.060]  is fascinating to me, right?
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.140]  So as I've been testing it,
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.060]  phone calls have the first priority.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.620]  If you have an active call, they always get the big slot.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.860]  The timer loses to everything all the time.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.980]  Right.
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.660]  You can just, if you start a timer,
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.780]  it'll just get pushed off the screen
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:11.740]  if you start other things.
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.620]  Turn-by-turn, I think, has priority too.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.620]  Like, it's just interesting to figure out
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:19.660]  how Apple is ranking all these different uses of the island.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.940]  And as more live activities roll out, who knows, right?
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.860]  Like, does a sports score supersede a phone call?
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:27.700]  Right.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.540]  I don't know.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.700]  But just stipulating that I do not know
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.140]  the answer to the ranking,
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.700]  you can just see a world where, like,
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.540]  you have the Chipotle app on your phone,
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.020]  and you haven't, like, force quit it.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.660]  So it's just, like, hanging out in the back.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:44.580]  And you, like, walk by a Chipotle,
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:46.700]  and it pops up the island, which it's like,
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:48.060]  do you want a burrito?
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:53.060]  I'm assuming that that is not possible.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.100]  I have no idea if it is or not.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:56.980]  The other thing that kind of stinks to me
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:59.140]  about the timer always getting secondary thing
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.220]  is it just shows the timer icon.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.940]  It doesn't show the time.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:05.020]  Yeah, it just shows you something.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.020]  I don't understand why the timer doesn't switch
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:11.500]  to showing you, like, if you've got five minutes,
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.900]  30 seconds left, why doesn't it say 5.30?
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.900]  And even if they don't want to update every second,
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.380]  even if it just updated every 10 seconds or something,
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.980]  that would be better than just showing the timer icon.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:23.340]  Yeah, or it's a circle, just have it count down.
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:26.460]  Yeah, or, yeah, like show analog style clock hands
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.660]  or something.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.980]  Yeah, again, this is what I mean.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:32.140]  Like, I just think we're, a year from now,
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:35.420]  we will actually know, and this is where my,
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.060]  maybe I'm just even more cynical than you are,
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:38.900]  but, like, that's where my cynicism is,
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.140]  is I can see how it's useful now.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.860]  I don't know if you're like me,
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.180]  but I, after a day with the first iPhone X,
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.100]  I just stopped seeing the notch entirely.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:54.620]  It went away, and I, last year on the 13 Pro,
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:55.820]  they're like, we made the notch smaller,
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:56.660]  and I was like, what notch?
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.340]  Yeah, yeah, yep, I thought the same thing,
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:35:59.660]  and I was like, did they really?
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.180]  And then I, like, compared it, and I was like,
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:03.740]  holy hell, they did, that actually is smaller.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:06.820]  Right, so, but the island is not invisible.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:09.540]  They moved it down, I run my phone in light mode,
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:12.260]  so there's bright light above and below it,
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:14.700]  so I see it, it is always moving.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.760]  So there's, like, looking at this thing a lot,
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.660]  and I, the big trade to me is, okay,
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.220]  well, now I have to see it.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.020]  It's not just, like, this invisible thing on the phone
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.220]  that, like, people complain about for sport on Twitter,
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:29.860]  but is actually, like, barely visible.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:31.140]  It's a thing that I'm looking at.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.820]  It actually, it's lower on the screen.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.900]  Whenever I get stressed out, I shop for cars.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:37.500]  I rarely buy a car, but it's been a very stressful
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.260]  couple weeks for me, so I've been shopping for cars,
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.100]  like, every minute.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.180]  A very odd stress reliever, but we all have our.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:45.180]  Like, I'm just like, what if I owned, like,
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.660]  a 1988 Mercedes, like, and I just, like, shop,
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:49.260]  like, just, like, see if I can buy one.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:50.860]  I never buy them, but, so I've had, like,
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.460]  the cars.com app, the top of it, the pictures of the car,
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.020]  because the island is lower,
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.340]  all the pictures of the car are cut off.
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:01.860]  This is, like, they'll update the app,
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.580]  and it's a tiny little personal experience,
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:07.200]  but it just made me think, like, the trade-off of value
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:10.660]  I am getting right now for this thing being visible
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:15.100]  is not gonna be aligned until the Packers game is in there,
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.900]  until Flighty is in there, and I'm in the airport,
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:17.860]  and I'm like, this is rad.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.660]  Like, there's just a ramp to utility
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:26.000]  that has not been achieved yet, and I, we'll just see,
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.340]  and I, like, the off-ramps from utility are,
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:29.580]  yeah, they're gonna stick ads in it.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.460]  Can we intercede?
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.540]  Can we complain about American Airlines?
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:36.100]  Hey, their app is horrible.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.380]  Flighty is awesome.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:39.540]  If anybody out there, even if you only fly occasionally,
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.380]  Flighty is so much more useful.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:46.020]  My flight home from San Francisco last Friday
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.460]  was supposed to be at, like, let's say 1 p.m.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.560]  It was, like, 1255 or something, and at 1230,
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.240]  when we were already supposed to have started boarding,
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.260]  they made an announcement that we might be boarding
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.740]  20 to 30 minutes late,
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:01.500]  because the mechanics are looking at an issue,
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.940]  and I turned to the guy next to me and said,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.100]  we're not getting on this plane,
[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:08.380]  because if they thought we might have a 30,
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.580]  even an hour delay while mechanics fix something,
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.860]  they would load us on the plane
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.020]  and make us sit in our seats while they do it.
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:18.420]  That's happened to me, you know, it's happened to everybody.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.020]  If they don't let you board the plane,
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.780]  they don't think the plane's gonna take off,
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.300]  and lo and behold, the plane never took off,
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.340]  and we had to wait for another plane,
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.740]  and it was, I don't know, five hours later
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.020]  when a plane came.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:33.680]  But my favorite part was when the gate agent announced it,
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.680]  and she said, don't worry, it's a good plane this time.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.440]  Right over the PA system.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.480]  That's pretty good.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:46.320]  So when I was, so my week at the Apple event
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.200]  was ridiculous, so I was home in Chicago for Labor Day,
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.180]  and then I flew to LA for code,
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.860]  and then I flew to the Apple event,
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:56.360]  and then I flew back to LA, and then I flew to New York.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.440]  And just to make all that work,
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.200]  I flew every major domestic airline,
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.380]  just to arrange all the flights,
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.160]  and actually, I was so worried about not making it
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.080]  from code to Cupertino that I booked two flights
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:14.600]  out of LA to SFO, and I had competing
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.760]  American and Delta flights.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.800]  So rarely do you directly compare the apps
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.640]  of major airlines, but just that week,
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.160]  I flew them all.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.940]  I was at LAX three times in three days,
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.160]  which I do not recommend,
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.880]  just not a good way to spend your time.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.360]  And so I was like, Delta has the best one, I think.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.120]  United is somewhere in the middle,
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.600]  and then the American Airlines app
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.600]  is full of the weirdest custom sheets animations,
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.080]  and they just are bouncing around.
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.400]  It's just kick them off the store, Apple.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.560]  Just be like, human interface, we run the store, all right?
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.400]  You're gone.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.520]  Come back when you've done some system-level animations.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.800]  I like how they spent so much time
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.480]  putting beautiful wallpapers behind the background.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:01.480]  It's like the main thing about the American app
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.320]  acts as though it's the only app
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.400]  you'll ever use on the phone,
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.640]  and it has a wallpaper,
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.840]  and they show these beautiful locations
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.660]  from around the world,
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.360]  and it's the only thing that looks good in the app.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.280]  Who gives a shit?
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.720]  Nobody's going to the American Airlines app
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.540]  to see pictures of the islands of Maui.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.440]  Yeah, yeah, it's...
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.720]  I don't think I'm saying anything controversial or new
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.280]  to be like, airline apps are bad.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.540]  I'm just saying that the island offers you the opportunity
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:28.840]  to opt out of them,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.680]  but how long is it going to take American
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.600]  to build their island widget?
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:35.680]  I don't know, but I just opened the app,
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:36.700]  and I'm looking at it now,
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:39.960]  and I would estimate that two-thirds of the screen
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.160]  is an ad for the city adventure.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:44.560]  This is what I'm saying.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.360]  When you're like, the widget has to be
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:49.180]  the purest representation of the app,
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:50.560]  well, if you look at the app,
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.320]  it's the purest representation of it
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.720]  is a call to action to sign up for a credit card.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.560]  You know how it's sort of weird that a computer company
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.000]  like Apple and an online retailer like Amazon
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.920]  are now major streaming networks and platforms, right?
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.120]  It's, you know, we get it.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:10.320]  We're not going to go there on this show.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:11.260]  There's too much to talk about,
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:12.520]  but it's just sort of like,
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.480]  it's kind of weird though,
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.060]  that it's like two of the major streaming platforms
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.600]  with some of the best, most talked about content
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.580]  are a store and a computer company.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.320]  American Airlines is more like
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.320]  there's a credit card company that now bought an airline.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.360]  Yeah.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.280]  They just happen to run an airline.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.640]  Yeah, and this is like all of the major airlines now.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.160]  You know, Sony in Japan is basically an insurance company
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.360]  that happens to make TVs.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.860]  Like, it just, the end comes for you
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.240]  and you don't even know it happened.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.600]  You're like, oh, we're a financial services company.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:46.760]  We were on vacation as a family in August
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.600]  and on the flight home,
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.680]  and of course we're a threesome,
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.580]  or we were before my son went to college,
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:52.700]  and now we're back to a twosome.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.460]  But so we had seats in first,
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.680]  and guess who gets to sit by himself?
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.560]  It's always me, right?
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.000]  My son and my wife sit next to each other
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.720]  and I sit by myself.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.280]  I saw the most amazing thing happen.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.120]  The guy next to me signed up for the American credit card.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.080]  Oh my God.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:11.920]  On the flight.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.980]  I've never seen it. That's great.
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:14.280]  All of my life.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.140]  It finally worked.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:15.980]  That's the one.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:17.520]  That's the one conversion they get a year
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.840]  that justifies all of the ads.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.340]  All of the miles I've ever flown.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.520]  And they can't even track it, right?
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.440]  They make the pilot say the announcement on every flight
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.360]  and they don't even know that it worked one time.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.100]  Here, I'm looking at my American app.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:35.320]  I have 308,000 miles, award miles.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.640]  That's how often I have flown on American.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.040]  And I saw a guy sign up for the credit card
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.160]  right there on the flight.
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:43.540]  Oh my God.
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:44.880]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.360]  and I will thank our next sponsor and we'll move on,
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.060]  but I want to thank our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:52.080]  Oh man, everybody knows Squarespace.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:57.080]  That is the all-in-one platform for building your website.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.500]  And they cover everything.
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.360]  They've got templates to choose from.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.160]  You can register your domain name with them.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.160]  Once you have the template you want to start with,
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.260]  you can tweak it to your heart's desire.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.840]  And it is a complete drag and drop interface
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.840]  right in the browser.
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:16.760]  It is what you see is what you get
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:20.200]  because while you're editing your website,
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.520]  it looks exactly like it's going to look for everybody else
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.320]  except the admin and design tools
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:27.640]  are removed from the screen.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.340]  Analytics, online stores, email campaigns.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.840]  You want to run email campaigns,
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.760]  you could do it right from Squarespace.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.220]  Same platform you use to update the content on your website.
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:40.640]  You can update the emails that you send to people.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.640]  It's all there, all built in.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.800]  It is exactly the first place you should go
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.760]  to build your next website
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:49.020]  or to redesign a website you already have.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.240]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:53.440]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.560]  That's squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:00.880]  You get a free trial, 30 days, no credit card required.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.080]  Everything you see is exactly like it'll be
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.200]  where the 30 days are up.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.920]  You just remember that code talk show.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:07.640]  You save 10% off your first purchase.
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.080]  You could pay for a whole year in advance,
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:14.080]  save 10% with that code squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.180]  And let's see, anything else on the iPhones?
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.120]  How about the cameras?
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:18.680]  That's certainly worth talking about.
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.400]  Yeah, I'll just, here's my, this is, they have a new sensor.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.000]  I think it's 48 megapixels sensor on a pro.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.100]  And I think they are being too conservative with it.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.400]  And I think it looked, they can do more with it.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.920]  And right now they're just, they're in this weird corner
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.160]  where they're doing a lot of noise reduction
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.280]  and a lot of sharpening and they should stop it
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.680]  and let the sensor shine.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.280]  That's my hot tick.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.960]  So again, I have not, as we record,
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.720]  the closest red review is yours
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.040]  because I knew you were gonna be in the show.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.320]  And I'm gonna tell you the truth, I'll admit it.
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:01.280]  I always read your reviews, your first or second.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.560]  I was looking at your example photos
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.520]  and you had some example photos and a good selection.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.840]  You had some where you compared the 14 Pro to the 13 Pro.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.840]  Some where you compared to the Pixel 6, what?
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  What's the best 6 Pixel from last year?
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.680]  Yeah, Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.640]  And some where you compared against the Samsung Galaxy 22,
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.880]  whatever the last word of that phone is.
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:35.120]  It's not that the iPhone looks bad,
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:38.040]  but you're describing it as inconsistent
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.880]  is exactly what I'm seeing, right?
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.880]  That, again, not bad.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.320]  And we're talking about all these phones
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.120]  are excellent cameras for phones, truly excellent.
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.640]  We live in a wonderful era,
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.480]  but the iPhone seems a little all over the place.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.880]  I thought that the night shot comparison with the Pixel,
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.160]  and like you said, they were very different.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.280]  I thought the iPhone one was much better.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:02.560]  That's more to my liking.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.400]  Yeah, the iPhone's brighter and the Pixel is more even,
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.560]  is like how I would put it.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.800]  And I thought like the entrance to the bar
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.240]  or restaurant, whatever it was,
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.160]  just looked deeper and richer.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:15.080]  I thought the Pixel kind of blew that one,
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.920]  but not in a bad way, but it's just not to my liking.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:20.160]  But then you had the shot across like a harbor
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.560]  or a river or something.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:25.640]  And the iPhone's was just strange in my opinion.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:29.720]  Like it did really weird things with the sky
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.560]  that almost looked like somebody
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.520]  like took like the smudge tool in Photoshop
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.040]  and just ran it over the sky.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.440]  And I don't really understand what it did
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.840]  with the reflection of the Ferris wheel in the water.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.520]  That's really, that was the one that got me.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.480]  I was like, ooh, we're doing too much, right?
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.880]  Like, yeah, and that's, yeah, like it over sharpened.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.320]  There's a Ferris wheel.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.560]  It's a neat shot and it's a good example
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.840]  because it's nighttime, it's water.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:58.840]  There's a Ferris wheel across the water
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.760]  that's got all sorts of bright colored lights.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.240]  And where it really over sharpened to me
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:06.680]  was on the reflection in the water.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:09.960]  Like it just did something weird where there's the Pixel.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.040]  It's like, yeah, that's what the shot should look like.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.480]  Yeah, I think the last,
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.880]  so the last time I reviewed iPhone Pro
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.440]  was the 12 Pro two years ago.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440]  And then Dieter did the 13s last year.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.400]  And so two years ago, I said,
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.480]  all these phones have started to look the same.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.680]  Like, you know, there was that moment
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.520]  where the Pixel was really opinionated
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:33.000]  and super contrasty and I loved those photos
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.760]  and the iPhone did really like over HDR in the beginning
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.120]  and everything was too like artificial looking.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.640]  And then Samsung was like in another planet with colors
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:44.600]  and kind of still is.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.080]  Yeah, no, but that just as an aside,
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:51.480]  I thought that that over press too heavy handed
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.840]  with the HDR was very odd for Apple
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.240]  because Apple's taste tends to run towards the natural
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.840]  in all cases.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.080]  And the HDR in a couple of years ago was really odd
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.680]  because it looked unnatural.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.720]  Yeah, it was just like, they were like, shadows are gone.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.080]  In our world, there are no shadows.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.440]  And it was like, actually, hold up.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:13.920]  Right, and then Google was like,
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.380]  in our world, everything is very moody.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:18.400]  And then Samsung was like, you're on drugs.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.760]  That was kind of, those are their looks, right?
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.680]  And it was like, fine.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.520]  And like, they were pricked about it.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.040]  And then a couple of years ago, not a lot of drugs,
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.440]  but a little drugs.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.680]  Yeah, just enough to have a good time, right?
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.640]  And then so they all converged a couple of years ago.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.560]  And then they're starting to diverge again.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.880]  And so last year, I think Dieter,
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:34.840]  when he reviewed the 13 Pro,
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.240]  he said, this camera's incredibly confident.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.120]  It knows what it is.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.160]  It knows what kinds of pictures it wants to make.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.520]  And it just does it every single time.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.520]  And I think the 14 Pro is trying to make 13 Pro pictures
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:50.880]  with a totally different sensor
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.720]  in a totally different pathway.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.960]  And it's just getting lost.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.520]  And it should make the pictures it wants to make.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:00.880]  That's a really good theory.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.640]  Cause I have to say, and again,
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.680]  one of the reasons I do it, I'm a one person show.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:07.920]  There's only so much I can do in a week.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.360]  I knew I kind of had the gist.
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.600]  I had enough, I was like,
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:14.040]  I think I got the trail of what I want to write.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.280]  I know it's going to be long.
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.920]  I'm going to have a hard time hitting a deadline.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.160]  I know I've got, actually,
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.680]  I'm not going to even be here on Wednesday.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.960]  So if I blow it and don't hit the Wednesday morning,
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960]  blah, blah, blah, I'm not going to shoot a lot of photos.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.120]  And the other thing is, even if I thought I had time
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:26.940]  to shoot the photos,
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.680]  I'm not going to do as good job as some people.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.600]  I'm not going to do even as good job as you.
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.520]  I'm certainly not going to do Austin Mann type stuff.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.600]  Somebody else is going to do it
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.040]  and I'll just link to them.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.800]  And we'll get back to that philosophy in a bit.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.640]  I'll just link to them.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.040]  But I did take some, of course I took some photos.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.960]  And of course I'm walking around with two phones
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.600]  in my pocket, my 13 Pro and my 14 Pro.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.880]  And I took a lot of photos where I'm like,
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.040]  I don't see a difference.
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.880]  And that's not a bad thing.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.080]  I've liked my 13 Pro, but I'm seeing that sort of,
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.760]  this is a way different sensor, way different sensor.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.360]  And I'm getting a lot of very similar shots.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.240]  But I think what you've stumbled upon
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:12.080]  is in edge conditions, it can't reproduce the same output.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:14.280]  And they should just let this sensor be itself.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:16.060]  And if they come out different, let it,
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:18.660]  it's a good sensor, it's a great sensor.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:22.000]  But it shouldn't look exactly the same
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.600]  as the 13 Pro in every condition.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.400]  The thing that kills me about that is like,
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.920]  so next year they'll let it be itself a little bit more.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:32.840]  You mentioned software locks earlier,
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:35.120]  and I did not jump on it because I wanted to bring it up
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.440]  in this part of the conversation.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:39.460]  They're not gonna roll whatever updates happen next year
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.920]  to this phone.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.760]  Right.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.060]  They're not gonna update this camera.
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:45.760]  The camera on the iPhone is like this bizarrely
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.640]  fixed object.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.960]  That changes crazily hardware year to hardware year.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:52.800]  Yeah.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.800]  Right, but so that it's like, they keep telling us
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.420]  that this is computational photography.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:58.360]  It's all defined in software.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.480]  And then every year they're like,
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.300]  and we have new hardware and no further software changes
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.140]  will come to the camera.
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:04.000]  And it's like, wait, hold up.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Like the 14 is basically the same phone as the 13, right?
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.440]  It has the same 12 megapixel sensor.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.480]  It has the same lens, as far as we can tell.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.320]  Like everything seems the same.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.160]  There's some changes.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.400]  It has the same processor.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:19.640]  Right.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:22.760]  And you're not giving it like whatever deep fusion
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.680]  is moving earlier in the pipeline to uncompressed images.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.720]  Yeah, the photonic engine.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.360]  And that's the real rebranding there, right?
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.860]  They're just doing deep fusion.
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:31.920]  By the way, I didn't know this.
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:36.920]  Deep fusion occurs on mid and low light images only.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.240]  And smart HDR happens elsewhere in the pipeline,
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.840]  mostly on bright images.
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.960]  Hmm.
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.880]  I had no idea this was true.
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:45.720]  Right.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.140]  So this is the curious thing about photonic engine
[01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:50.400]  being only on the 14 models.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.840]  But it is on all 14.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.540]  It's not locked to pros.
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:56.440]  It's all 14 models get photonic engine.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.720]  No other older iPhones get it.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.720]  But it's curious because the...
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.680]  Let's just say it even requires the fifth GPU core, right?
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:09.480]  Like the sort of song and dance
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:13.040]  of how did the 14 get a chip upgrade from the 13
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.760]  is when they're both on A15,
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:19.880]  is last year's iPhone 13's got a four core A15,
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.880]  but last year's 13 pros got a five core GPU on the A15.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.840]  They were binning the GPUs.
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.320]  And this year, the iPhone 14s,
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.920]  as a year over year comparison,
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:37.540]  get the one extra GPU core.
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.680]  And like I said in my review,
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:43.000]  one extra GPU core makes it sound, ah, who cares?
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.800]  25% more GPU processing sounds pretty cool.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.760]  So a glass half full, glass half empty.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.960]  It's an upgrade.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:53.920]  It's obviously the smallest upgrade chip wise
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.400]  ever in this era.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:58.440]  But now you see the pattern where next year
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:01.440]  it'll get the 16 and the pros will get the 17.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.760]  And now they're one generation apart.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:06.020]  And there's no way to get there
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:08.640]  without an awkward year like this one.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.980]  But so let's just say 13 pro,
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:15.400]  not even talking regular 13 and the regular iPhone 14,
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:20.400]  they both have the five GPU core A15 chip,
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:25.000]  but the last year's 13 pro doesn't get photonic engine.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.380]  So I asked, if they both have the A15, same A15, why is that?
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:31.120]  And I can't quote the answer,
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.040]  but it is something to the effect of,
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:34.880]  what I wanted to know,
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:37.800]  is there something else hardware in the pipeline, right?
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.960]  Is there some connection from the sensor
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:45.840]  to the image, the ISP that is faster
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.640]  so that it can process the raw instead of this,
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.560]  but only on the, even though the A14 has the same A15 chip,
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.840]  there's a pipeline to the sensor.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:56.900]  Is that the case or is this a software lock?
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.600]  And the answer was something to the effect of,
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:03.120]  our cameras and chips are designed to work together
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:06.240]  and require unique updates.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.200]  Right, they just like spun the wheel
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.800]  and they're like, here's the boilerplate.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:11.680]  Like, we're not gonna do the software.
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:14.840]  It is, it was an answer that I honestly,
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:18.440]  even though I speak fluent Cupertinoese,
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:23.120]  I honestly don't know what, if they were,
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.480]  I obviously did not get a yes or no,
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.280]  and I didn't expect to get a yes or no,
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.520]  but a lot of times I get an answer
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.000]  that I know how to interpret as a yes or a no.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:36.040]  And this one is, I don't know.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:36.880]  I really don't.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:41.200]  I kind of think yes, that there's some hardware
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:44.120]  improvement to the pipeline.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:49.120]  I do think so, but I'm like 50, 60% thinking
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.660]  there actually is a hardware aspect to it,
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:54.240]  even though it's the same system on a chip,
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.060]  but I don't know.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.620]  And I couldn't get an answer off the record either.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:00.200]  Yeah, look, if I was a 13 Pro owner,
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.000]  I'd be like, you have to tell me.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.500]  Like, right, let's just like explain to me exactly why.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:08.300]  And then if I was a 14 Pro owner,
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:13.300]  I would be like, I've got this new 48 megapixel sensor.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:17.680]  Apple can bin it into this quad pixel array
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:20.920]  that captures more light, or they can crop it
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.240]  to do this 2x zoom and this action mode stuff.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.480]  That's, those are the beginnings of ideas.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:30.420]  So if I'm paying $1,100 for this phone,
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:34.540]  am I gonna get more value out of the sensor in it over time?
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.600]  The way that I get more value out of every other piece
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.840]  of hardware on the phone, right?
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:43.640]  The processor can do more things over time.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:46.300]  More apps are developed that use the sensors,
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:48.980]  like all the stuff, like the phones just get better
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:49.820]  over time.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.860]  That dynamic island is gonna have more content
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.120]  later this year.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.760]  Yeah, you'll be able to sign up for a credit card
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.880]  directly from it, except this weird camera,
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:02.880]  which Apple is telling us is a software masterpiece.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:03.880]  And it is, right?
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.360]  We're doing all this processing, we're capturing
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.560]  seven images at once, we're layering them.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.240]  All this stuff is happening, but that is locked into place.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.800]  We've gone through how many computational photography
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.920]  iPhones now?
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.180]  The photos on the first day look basically the same
[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:20.680]  as the photos on the last day.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:24.680]  And to me, that's fundamentally bizarre,
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.280]  and fine, it is what it is.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:27.840]  But if you're the 13th-year-old owner this year,
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.680]  you've gotta be wondering, like, I should be able
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.440]  to get this software update.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:33.920]  You have to tell me why I can't get it,
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:37.600]  because it's an unlike Apple software lock
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:40.160]  in a way that not being able to hold down on the pill
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.120]  and get the dynamic island widget kind of isn't.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.720]  Like, sure, there's at least a reason for that.
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:47.380]  Like, we're reserving all of this for the island,
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.060]  we want that to be a consistent experience,
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.260]  we're doing hardware anti-aliasing that your phone can,
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.140]  whatever it is.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:55.420]  So this one is just purely, we're not gonna give you
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:00.240]  the software, or a reason, and then I think on the 14 Pro,
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.520]  because it's a little inconsistent,
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.800]  you should have the expectation that it will take
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.100]  software improvements over time.
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:10.320]  Let me put on my cynical hat and say that it's what
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:14.000]  I was told, and I can't quote them, but got an answer on,
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.400]  is the photonic engine hardware?
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.480]  Is that why it's only on the 14?
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:22.960]  Looking at the words of the answer,
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.320]  I'm 60% leaning towards yes, there's hardware.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.100]  But the cynic in me says, if it really was a hardware story,
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:32.800]  they could just tell us that, and they could say,
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:35.760]  yeah, our chip team made this incredible pipeline adjustment
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.760]  to read the data off the sensor faster,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.520]  and why wouldn't they just tell us that?
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.600]  Like, yeah, our hardware, because they like to brag
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:42.440]  about their hardware.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:46.600]  So the cynic in me says, sounds like a software lock.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.720]  We have a great new sensor that can pass data over the bus
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.520]  to the ISP in the A15, even faster than before,
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.740]  letting us do deep fusion on an uncompressed image.
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:57.760]  Great, I'll buy it.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.960]  But the fact that they won't say is like.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.580]  Yeah, and I'll just, let me just clarify your thing too
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.420]  about the photo set.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.060]  The modes of the camera, like portrait mode
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:09.620]  is the best example, do get software updates, right?
[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:12.480]  Like if you have a two or three year old iPhone,
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.480]  your portrait mode photos look better today
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:16.880]  than they did when you bought it,
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.640]  because the portrait mode does go through software
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:23.740]  that that improves, and the camera app updates.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:27.460]  It's just the, if you just take a regular still photo
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:30.640]  is the thing that doesn't seem to get improvements
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:32.020]  once the hardware ships.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:32.860]  I mean.
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:33.720]  Yeah, but it's bizarre,
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:37.000]  because it's a software defined camera, like at its heart.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.300]  You'd think so, right?
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:40.960]  I think even night mode is one of those things
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:43.640]  that does get improvements, right?
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:46.680]  It's just though the pure simplest thing
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:48.680]  the camera can do, take a shot
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:51.440]  and give me a 12 megapixel JPEG of it, right?
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.320]  Because putting, like you said in your review,
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:58.280]  99.8% of iPhone users have no reason to ever shoot RAW.
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:03.060]  And of them, if they did,
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:04.560]  they would think the camera was broken
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.360]  because they'd look at the RAW image
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:08.440]  and think this is the worst cell phone picture I've taken
[01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.120]  since I was using a Nokia flip phone,
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.920]  because that's what unprocessed RAW images look like.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.520]  I will say that I had a great time shooting RAW
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:15.360]  on this iPhone.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.000]  It's very slow.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.320]  Yeah, I only did enough just to see
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.920]  if it's slow, and they have an option
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:27.040]  to shoot 12 megapixel RAW.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.880]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:31.640]  Ah, yeah, go to settings, something.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.480]  Here's another one.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.800]  I have this in my notes.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.080]  And I know, I do this once a year,
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.720]  because I don't usually go to the camera settings
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:41.840]  in settings, but I do it every time I review a phone.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.220]  And I know it's a whole separate argument
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:49.080]  of how are the settings in the settings app organized?
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.160]  What is that?
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:54.000]  But look at how far down camera is.
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.720]  It is bizarrely low.
[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:59.120]  Yeah, it's not in the first grouping, right?
[01:59:59.120 --> 01:59:59.960]  It's in the second grouping.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:02.240]  No, it's, go look at it right now.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.080]  It's...
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:06.560]  Yeah, I always look for it in the first grouping.
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.120]  I wish it were in the first grouping.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.960]  I wish that you could rearrange these.
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:11.280]  It's not even in the third grouping.
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.120]  No, it's the first grouping,
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.720]  then there's the notifications one,
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:16.880]  then there's, the one where I really think it should be
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.320]  is like general control center, battery, blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.880]  Then there's the big long one with all the apps,
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.980]  mail, contacts, calendar, notes, reminders, voice, phone,
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:27.280]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Safari, news, translate,
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:28.800]  but nope, not there.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.160]  And then you go all the way down
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  and it's with music, TV, photos, camera, books.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.000]  I don't know what this group is.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.880]  This is the sixth grouping, I just counted.
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.520]  But anyway, go to camera and formats.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.720]  And then when you turn on Apple ProRAW,
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:44.920]  there's a thing that says ProRAW resolution
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.980]  and you can change it from 48 to 12.
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:51.020]  All right, I did not shoot any ProRAW at 12.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:52.580]  I had a lot of fun shooting at 48.
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:55.360]  When you hit the capture button, the shutter is still fast,
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:56.580]  but it just takes a lot of time
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:59.020]  to read all the data and process it.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:00.580]  And so it was like,
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:03.180]  I guess I would use this for landscapes.
[02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:05.420]  Like if anyone's moving, I want to take a bunch of frames.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:07.540]  Well, Apple has a weird rule too.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.820]  And while we're talking about cameras
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.180]  and philosophical differences with like the Pixel team
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:14.680]  and other companies, not weird, but unique.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.660]  Apple has had a obvious unofficial,
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.120]  but that I happen to know internally is an official rule.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.540]  They just don't talk about it publicly.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:27.540]  But everything the iPhone camera does has to happen live.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:30.860]  There can be no, nothing happens where you hit the shutter
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:33.660]  and it takes a while to process, right?
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:35.820]  And like the Pixel team doesn't quite,
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:38.360]  it's not that the Pixel camera is known as being slow,
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.980]  but like when Pixel had night mode originally,
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:45.100]  you'd take a night mode photo and it would take a second
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.060]  or two for the night mode processing to show up
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.060]  in the thumbnail of the thing that you took,
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:53.500]  which I think most people think is fine, right?
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:56.420]  I mean, if we used to wait, when I was a kid,
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:59.060]  like two minutes for a Polaroid to develop,
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:01.580]  sit there waving it in the air, which of course did nothing,
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:02.980]  but felt like you were doing something.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:04.380]  It's like hitting elevator buttons
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:05.800]  or crosswalk buttons, right?
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.700]  I want to cross the street.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.860]  I'll hit the button a couple of times.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:10.780]  But Apple only does stuff if it's like the rule,
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.460]  it has to be instantaneous.
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:16.820]  The way that these 48 megapixel RAWs take,
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:20.300]  I don't know how long, I would call it a moment at least,
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.620]  a pregnant pause to show up.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:27.620]  I don't think, I think they've made an exception to it,
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:28.460]  right?
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:30.540]  They knew they wanted to have a 48 megapixel sensor.
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:34.240]  This was obviously set in stone hardware wise years ago.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:37.020]  And I'm sure they tried to make it as fast as possible,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.220]  but there's no other way about it.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.620]  They have to, but if they didn't already offer RAW,
[02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:46.340]  they wouldn't offer RAW this year because it takes so long.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.680]  I think the only reason there's this pause
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.340]  is that they offered RAW
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:53.460]  when they could do it seemingly instantaneously.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.340]  Now the RAW feature is in the system.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.480]  And so they have to continue supporting it.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.200]  But now that they've added four times the pixels
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.860]  to the sensor, they've put themselves in a position
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:07.620]  that they unofficially would never want to be in
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:10.260]  where it takes a pregnant pause
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.020]  for a 48 megapixel RAW to be processed.
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:16.740]  It is the longest thing that any photo does
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.420]  in the camera app that I can remember using any iPhone ever.
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:22.980]  But who cares?
[02:03:22.980 --> 02:03:23.820]  It's for 90.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.700]  Anybody who actually wants to shoot 48 megapixel RAW
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:28.040]  is fine with it.
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.100]  They're gonna be just fine.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:31.700]  This is the one time where I'm like,
[02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:35.500]  it's kind of weird that like a Canon 5D
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.900]  outperforms the iPhone.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.740]  Yeah.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:38.580]  Like, yeah, that is true.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:40.140]  I think it never usually happens,
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:44.100]  but like you can just like fire off 30 megapixel 5D images
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:46.300]  at a hundred frames a second or whatever.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:47.400]  And it's fine.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:48.300]  It'll just like handle them
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:49.820]  and send them to the memory card and be done.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:50.660]  Right.
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:52.940]  Right, because, you know, of course the Canons
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:55.780]  and the Sonys of the world with the real cameras
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:59.480]  have all the glass advantages and the sensor size advantages
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.820]  and all the things that come from physics
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:04.100]  and all the things that come from decades
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.700]  of building high-end professional glass
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:07.700]  and all this stuff.
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:11.820]  But man, the one thing that Apple has is silicon.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.020]  Yeah, and so it's weird, right?
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:16.180]  Because what we're talking about here is like bandwidth.
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.860]  Like fundamentally it's slow
[02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:19.780]  because you're just moving the image
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.040]  off the sensor to storage.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.940]  Right.
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:25.300]  And those cameras are all just completely optimized
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:26.820]  to do that as fast as possible.
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:27.640]  Right.
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.860]  And here is the one place where you're like,
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:31.420]  oh, this is a general purpose computer
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:33.260]  that is struggling with this one problem.
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.380]  Yeah.
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.180]  And like usually with these cameras,
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.260]  it's like this general purpose computer
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.080]  is just like totally outperforming these other cameras
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.300]  unless you really know how to use them.
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:43.260]  Yeah.
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:45.820]  And like, it was like, it's like, I can say to you,
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:47.020]  it's like, I couldn't put it in the review
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:48.220]  because it's such a wonky thought,
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:49.880]  but it was like the whole time I was like,
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:51.740]  I've got like a five-year-old 5D
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.300]  that is kicking this thing's ass
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.400]  at shooting high megapixel images.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.240]  That's weird.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.580]  Yeah, it's weird because it's not,
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:00.460]  that's the thing that Apple's always kicked ass at.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:01.660]  Yeah.
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.420]  Let me think here, anything else with the camera?
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:04.860]  The video looks amazing.
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:07.180]  And that's the one area where Apple,
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:09.260]  for whatever reason, I don't get it,
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:13.540]  why so many years later, Apple's video is so far ahead.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:16.380]  Whereas like on photography,
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:18.060]  I think arguably there's still,
[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.860]  the iPhone 14 Pro is still the best.
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:23.280]  I think you can, but it is a very,
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.780]  it is a great debate, right?
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.020]  You can make the case for Samsung,
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:28.380]  you can make the case for the Pixel
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.300]  and the new Pixel's coming out, I guess next month.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:33.960]  That's a debate to be had and it has been for years.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.460]  And like we just talked about half an hour ago,
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:39.220]  it's ebbed and flowed in interesting ways.
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:41.020]  But on video, it's undisputed.
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:43.220]  Apple is so far ahead of everybody else.
[02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:44.460]  And I don't get it.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:46.700]  I don't get why they have, why,
[02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:47.940]  I get why they pulled ahead,
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:51.140]  but I don't get why nobody else has been able to catch up.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.500]  I think that might just be down to the processing weight,
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:55.220]  right, everyone else is still kind of like,
[02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:56.620]  whatever Qualcomm will give them.
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:57.820]  But it's hard to know.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:59.860]  I will say that the one thing that caught me about
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:04.340]  the difference between the 14 Pro and the regular 14.
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:06.100]  So action mode is like not that useful.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.340]  And the same way that cinematic mode
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:08.240]  was not that useful last year,
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:09.620]  it demands a lot of light.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.660]  It's obviously its first year.
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:13.980]  Cinematic mode is greatly improved this year,
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:16.460]  but the way they're doing it is they're cropping
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:20.500]  the sensor down and then recording the whole sensor
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:24.620]  and then moving that crop around to stabilize it.
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:25.620]  In between frames.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:29.020]  And this is another one where they're doing it live, right?
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:30.500]  And if they would just let themselves
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.460]  have five seconds of slack
[02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:36.100]  or not show it in the viewfinder live.
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:37.300]  It's something.
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.660]  They're showing a shittier preview, like whatever it is.
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:42.900]  But well, the 48 megapixel sensor is way bigger.
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:45.140]  So like theoretically have way more space to stabilize
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.620]  and they're not doing it, right?
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:49.180]  And like maybe that's bandwidth, maybe that's processing.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.180]  There's a million reasons,
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:53.300]  but it's strange that in some of these places
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.780]  they're kind of not using that sensor for all it can do.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.140]  It's just my opinion of it.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:58.520]  Yeah, I wonder, I don't know.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.460]  But I mean, action mode,
[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.740]  if you ever have gotten on a rollercoaster
[02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:05.100]  and I don't know, I would recommend putting a lanyard
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.060]  on your phone or something.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:07.400]  But if you've ever held your phone
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:08.720]  while shooting something like that,
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:09.940]  I think it's gonna be terrific.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.940]  Absolutely terrific from what I've seen testing it.
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:13.780]  But the fact that-
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:15.340]  Rebecca is our video director.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:16.580]  She did that part of the video review.
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:17.420]  It's great.
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:19.540]  She's very, she has a great time reviewing these things.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.740]  And she was like, this looks basically like the 13 Pro.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.420]  That was her main takeaway.
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:24.620]  I think they know what they're doing
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.620]  and I'm not blaming them,
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:30.340]  but it seems like with these camera mode features,
[02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:32.980]  Apple is a little unusually aggressive
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:36.520]  about shipping the feature a year ahead
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:38.140]  of when it's really ready, right?
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.980]  Like the first year of portrait mode
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:44.460]  was really rough with hair and ears and-
[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:45.880]  Oh, that was the one that really got me,
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.900]  that Samsung is ahead of Apple in portrait mode.
[02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:49.580]  Yep, I saw that in your example.
[02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:53.460]  And I was, you can't look at the side-by-side and deny it.
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:56.140]  I have taken some amazing portrait fixers
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:58.900]  with my iPhone over the last couple of years.
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:02.460]  And it's great, but if we want to get into,
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:04.980]  and it's so much better than it was a few years ago.
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:08.380]  And again, anybody listening who like a couple of years ago
[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:10.740]  tried portrait mode on an iPhone was like,
[02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:14.060]  ah, no, gross gimmick, and hasn't looked at it since,
[02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.620]  I really encourage you to try it again.
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:18.780]  Even if you have an older, a slightly older iPhone,
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:21.620]  but with the latest software, it really is a lot better
[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:24.380]  and it's actually useful and less gimmicky.
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:26.180]  And I think it's good that they shipped when they did.
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:28.660]  And I think it was like a forcing function
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:32.920]  to make them improve all the tricky things it needs to do.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.540]  But yeah, your side-by-side example
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.980]  with the Samsung Galaxy 22 was,
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:41.220]  the hair around the guy was clearly, clearly,
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:43.680]  honestly, with the Samsung one, I did, I zoomed in,
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:46.740]  I couldn't really see, couldn't see a mistake.
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:47.780]  Yeah, they did a good job.
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:51.100]  We have another one where it's just cut off outside,
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:54.220]  like in bright sunlight, it just cut off the side
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.860]  of our video producer Mario's head.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:58.460]  And I was like, that's, we're beyond this now.
[02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:00.980]  It was good, portrait mode got good on the 12 Pro,
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:03.100]  in my opinion, that's when I started using it all the time.
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:06.860]  And I was like, we should, even the baby S22, not the Ultra,
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:10.420]  the iPhone 14 version of the S22 outperforms
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:13.820]  the iPhone 14 Pro, which is totally shocking to me.
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:14.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:15.500]  By the way, I'm looking at these,
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:16.780]  now I'm looking at these bar photos.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:18.820]  I know why we disagree.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:20.180]  I'm gonna describe a photo here.
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:22.860]  See, iPhone does a better job of, you're right,
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:25.220]  richer colors at night, and it has this kind of like
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:27.340]  beautiful, natural venting.
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:30.580]  The Pixel is more accurate because it lets the red light
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:32.380]  bleed into the other parts of the,
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.580]  the iPhone is color correcting too many things.
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:38.540]  That was, I forgot that this was my criticism.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:39.640]  I just looked at it again, I remember.
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:40.540]  All right, all right.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.420]  But anybody who's wondering what we're talking about,
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:45.060]  just go to the Verge review, scroll down to the,
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:47.900]  it's the one that has the really nifty slider
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:50.460]  you guys have where it looks like one photo
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:53.300]  and you can just slide the divider left and right
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:55.660]  to go between the two pictures.
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:58.240]  It's a picture from the outside of a bar,
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:00.260]  sort of kitty corner to the entrance.
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:02.420]  It's a neon sign, so it's like one of those shots
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:03.860]  that really shows off at night mode.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:05.260]  Anything else on the camera?
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:08.380]  Any, no, I mean, fundamentally, you know,
[02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:10.820]  I think these cameras are all really good now.
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.400]  It's down to processing.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.460]  I will say this one thing.
[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:14.660]  So I was talking about these old cameras.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:17.900]  So I was taking macro photos of the sub-pixels
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:20.340]  to see if it was worth shooting a video of.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:23.060]  And I've got this ancient Canon, no, it's a,
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:25.260]  I've got this ancient Nikon D7500
[02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:26.900]  with my favorite lens of all time,
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:30.060]  which is a 40 millimeter, they call it a micro lens.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.660]  And I love it, and this, whatever.
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:33.280]  So I'm sitting there and my kid's there
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:36.580]  and I just took a photo of my friend and my kid
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:39.420]  with my ancient D7500,
[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:41.340]  because I was taking photos of the screen.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:42.340]  And I looked at it and I was like,
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:44.900]  oh, these photos are still vastly superior
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.300]  to cell phone photos.
[02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:49.940]  And so there's still a long way to go here, right?
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:52.300]  Like really nice glass on a dedicated camera
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.140]  with a big sensor,
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:56.180]  it'll just kill these smartphones every day.
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:59.720]  I still use my smartphone a thousand times more,
[02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:01.440]  but I think we often forget
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:04.660]  that there's yet a very long road to travel.
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:06.940]  My son, Jonas, is a freshman in college.
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:08.420]  We just took him there.
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:10.700]  And so it's time for family memories.
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.020]  And so we're at the end of the summer
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:15.060]  looking at lots of old photos
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:17.900]  and paying more attention to the photo widget in iOS
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.500]  that surfaces old photos.
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.900]  And instead of just, hey, that's one cool photo,
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:26.180]  letting me open it and go through 18, 17,
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.640]  16 year old photos.
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.460]  Back then in 2004, five, six,
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:36.060]  I was shooting 35 millimeter film with a Canon,
[02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:39.260]  mostly with a 50 millimeter F1.4,
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:42.780]  with a famous Canon 50 millimeter prime.
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:46.080]  And holy hell, looking at those photos.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.900]  They're so fricking good.
[02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:56.100]  Oh my God, they are so buttery bokeh, right?
[02:11:56.100 --> 02:12:00.100]  Like, oh shit, that's bokeh.
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.380]  Oh, that's texture.
[02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.740]  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:06.780]  And that's talking shooting onto film.
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:08.820]  And again, film is beautiful, I'm not complaining.
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.500]  But we tend to think that,
[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:12.900]  oh, tech, tech, tech, computational photography.
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:15.820]  But yeah, there's so far to go.
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:17.100]  I had one more thing about,
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:18.500]  oh, here's one more thing about the camera.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:19.820]  I didn't mention it in my review,
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:21.260]  because again, I didn't do a camera review.
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:23.200]  I'll bet other people mentioned it.
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.580]  One thing I noticed though, with this new main camera,
[02:12:26.580 --> 02:12:31.020]  with a bigger sensor, and because the sensor is bigger,
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:33.840]  a very different lens,
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:36.620]  the minimum focal distance of the main camera
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:39.180]  has grown by a couple of inches.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.020]  So.
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:41.680]  Yeah, and then it drops you into that macro mode.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.520]  Right.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.340]  That's crazy.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:46.220]  So there's, this thing they added last year,
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:48.780]  anybody who has a 13 Pro knows what I'm talking about,
[02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:50.740]  but when they added this macro mode,
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:53.380]  and you're in 1x mode, when you go to macro mode,
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:56.620]  it actually uses the ultra wide 0.5x,
[02:12:56.620 --> 02:12:59.100]  because that's the lens that can focus at
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:00.700]  like a two centimeters.
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:04.140]  And the transition is weird,
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:09.140]  but it kicks in way, way further away from the subject now.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:12.580]  And it's, this is not good overall,
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:14.500]  but there's, I understand the physics
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:16.100]  of focal lengths and distances,
[02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:20.580]  but it's, it is a trade off in the other direction
[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:24.220]  for having this overall better main camera,
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.980]  but macro photography, the macro transition,
[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:29.220]  not that macro is worse, macro is probably better,
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:32.220]  because it seems like the ultra wide is actually nicely,
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.800]  subtly improved this year.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:36.860]  But the transition, people are gonna notice that.
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:38.660]  Do you, it's also the transition I think
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:40.500]  is like half an inch too aggressive.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.040]  Yeah, I think so too.
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:42.880]  Yeah, there's something-
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:45.720]  Because I have the indicator in settings,
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.320]  you can do it, so you can turn it off,
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:48.700]  and it's like, oh, you don't need this right now.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.400]  Yeah, that's another one where I would recommend
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:54.060]  people go into settings, scroll, scroll, scroll,
[02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:57.400]  scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll to camera,
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:01.580]  and turn on the thing that gives you manual macro control.
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:04.180]  I think this is one of those things where Apple wants it
[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:07.520]  to be invisible, and they want you to think that magically
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.700]  the One X camera can just focus two centimeters away,
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:13.420]  and so that's why they don't put the little flower
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:16.020]  macro thing up on the screen by default.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.420]  And in fact, when they shipped the 13 Pros last year,
[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:19.700]  they didn't even have it.
[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:22.480]  They had to add that into the camera app later,
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.260]  because everybody was complaining about it.
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:25.700]  But they're so obsessed with making,
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:28.180]  thinking that they can make it seem like magic,
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:29.940]  but that's something that does not look,
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:32.080]  that transition does not look like magic.
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:35.660]  And when you really don't want macro, it's maddening.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.220]  But you can actually go into settings
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:39.540]  and get a little button that'll show up on screen
[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:42.240]  when macro kicks in, and tap it and turn it off,
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.300]  and then you'll get what you want.
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:46.540]  Here's a little thing, just a side note.
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:48.380]  I would talk about, I don't wanna spend a lot of time
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.220]  on the SIM card thing.
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:51.580]  I think we both sort of agreed that they made the right move
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:54.300]  for consumers in the US, and yeah, it's probably old,
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:55.640]  but it sucks for us.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:58.440]  But did you use, the phones they gave us,
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:01.020]  because for the last couple of years,
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:02.460]  they've just been giving me, at least,
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:04.600]  review unit phones that don't even have a SIM card,
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:08.540]  don't have like a testing, paid by Apple, Verizon account,
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:10.860]  just unlocked phones with no SIM card,
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:13.380]  and they just assume I'm gonna put my SIM card in them.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:14.760]  Well, you can't do that now.
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.180]  So all the three phones I got from Apple
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:20.180]  had eSIMs already set up, like.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:21.660]  No, mine didn't.
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:23.780]  Or maybe there was like a QR code in the box.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:25.160]  No, I didn't even have a QR code.
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:28.180]  They were just already, like my iPhone boxes
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:29.220]  were not sealed.
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.420]  It looked like they were,
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:33.020]  but there was no seal to open the box,
[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:35.260]  but the phone still had the sticker on the front,
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:37.520]  and I got to peel it off and everything.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:40.740]  But I already had like three phones
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:43.980]  with three different phone numbers on eSIMs on the phones.
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:47.320]  And I did transfer my main account
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:48.800]  to the one I spent the week with
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:50.900]  and still am spending time with.
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:55.840]  Because they did that for me, I got to test dual SIM support.
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:58.500]  I didn't get that, maybe our actual reviewers,
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:00.060]  like Alison, got it.
[02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:03.420]  I just got the Pro Max, that was the only phone I had.
[02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:04.360]  She has all of them.
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:06.500]  But I have an AT&T account, I have a Google Fi account.
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:08.700]  So I actually, I just did my AT&T account
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.460]  for my old phone over Bluetooth, which is seamless.
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:13.940]  And then I added my Google Fi account on the web,
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:16.140]  which is actually like kind of great.
[02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:18.340]  Like Google Fi's weird, and you gotta like go in
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:20.900]  and add all these like APN numbers and stuff at the end.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:24.880]  But the actual like move the SIM over
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:27.660]  is you just go to a page of the QR code
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:28.840]  and you just like point the phone.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:31.860]  I didn't even get the QR code all the way in the frame.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:33.820]  Like we were trying to shoot it on video
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:34.980]  and I was like, here I go.
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:37.220]  And I got like halfway up and I was like, it's done.
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:39.060]  And back, it was like, well, what the fuck?
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:43.220]  Like, I was like, that's it, like, it's pretty seamless.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:44.340]  But here's my complaint.
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:47.540]  My complaint is when you have dual SIMs activated,
[02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:52.420]  the icon for the bars for the signal strength,
[02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:54.580]  they look like exclamation marks.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:56.140]  They kinda do.
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:01.100]  And so I just assumed, and I noticed it only after,
[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:03.460]  it was like a couple of days in of reviewing it
[02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:06.320]  before I reset the phone and restored the other way,
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:08.100]  device to device instead of iCloud.
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:09.980]  I like wiped the phone and restored again.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:11.560]  And I was like, this time I'll do it for real.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:14.420]  And they're like, do you wanna move your existing SIM card
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.460]  from this device to device transfer over?
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:18.520]  I was like, yes, and I did.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.720]  And they're like, this'll take a couple of minutes.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:22.140]  And of course it takes a couple of minutes
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:23.620]  because anytime you deal with a carrier,
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:27.180]  it's whatever activation means, God only knows.
[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:30.760]  But two minutes later, they said success and it worked.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:33.900]  But I looked at the status bar and it's these bars
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:36.780]  and they put the secondary SIM as like a little layer
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:39.540]  beneath, but they look like the dots on exclamation marks.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:42.700]  And I assumed they were, and that something was wrong.
[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:44.700]  And it was trying to tell me something's wrong.
[02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:46.460]  Cause I'd never done an eSIM before.
[02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:47.940]  I'd never done a transfer.
[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:50.940]  I thought they turned my bars into exclamation marks
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.260]  as a warning that something was wrong.
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:55.180]  And I spent five minutes trying to figure out
[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:57.980]  what was wrong cause it seemed to be working
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:18:00.740]  until I figured out, oh, that's how they're showing me
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:01.580]  I have dual SIMs.
[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:04.620]  They just made them look like exclamation marks.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.980]  Yeah, and you can't, speaking of widgets,
[02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:09.420]  like you bring down control center and then you're like,
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:11.540]  oh, I got two carriers here.
[02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:12.700]  Maybe I wanna do something with them
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:14.500]  and you tap on it and nothing happens.
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.900]  Yeah, like it's a very wonky thing
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:19.380]  to have two SIM cards in your phone.
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:21.660]  Like it's cool.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.660]  Like if you have a business line and a personal line,
[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:24.500]  it makes a lot of sense.
[02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:27.580]  You can like take the calls in different ways.
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:30.100]  The one thing I wanna do the most of all
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.060]  is switch from one data plan to the other, right?
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:37.940]  Cause Google Fi is basically T-Mobile and I have AT&T
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:42.760]  and like T-Mobile is just faster than AT&T in New York City.
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.580]  So like I should just switch it over.
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.460]  Even in Google Fi is LTE.
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:49.260]  So T-Mobile LTE is faster than AT&T 5G in New York City.
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:50.980]  And you have to like dive into settings and do it
[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:52.660]  or set it to auto and you have no idea what's gonna happen.
[02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:54.300]  Things you'll never get the company
[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:56.100]  that makes any cell phone to tell you
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.700]  is how often LTE is better than 5G
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:01.180]  in real world situations.
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:03.860]  No, I basically turn 5G off on my phone.
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:07.420]  Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:09.900]  And when you do get the ultra wide
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:12.480]  and it's three gigabytes per second download,
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:14.540]  which is incredibly impressive technically,
[02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:15.540]  what the hell are you doing
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:18.600]  that needs three gigabytes per second download to a phone?
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.760]  Yeah, I did hear from some readers
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.140]  because I was very mean to 5G in my review.
[02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:24.460]  I got some emails from people who were like,
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:26.980]  look, I live in the middle of nowhere
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:31.660]  and I've actually, they put up a mid band 5G tower here
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:33.820]  and now my Verizon 5G at my house
[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:35.980]  is faster than my cable internet.
[02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:36.820]  Yeah, that's great.
[02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:38.740]  It's like that rules, like I'm super down with that.
[02:19:38.740 --> 02:19:40.300]  That's like four people in the country.
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:43.380]  It was the same thing with the 3G to LTE transition.
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:45.700]  Here in Philly, I know going to New York,
[02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:47.620]  it actually is better to be on the older one
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:49.100]  cause that's the one that had the build out
[02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:50.860]  and finally got signal strength
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:52.220]  to go into buildings and stuff
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:53.980]  and it's like the practical beats
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:55.560]  the theoretical every time.
[02:19:56.940 --> 02:19:58.220]  Yeah, and it's also,
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.260]  yeah, the carriers sell everybody 5G phones.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.660]  The 5G network is like immediately overloaded
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.820]  and the LTE network is not.
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:06.880]  It'll be, 5G is going to be fantastic
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:09.580]  once they start talking to us about 6G.
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:10.580]  Yeah, that's about right.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.740]  Which is always the case.
[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:13.460]  Let me take a break here and thank our third
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:18.460]  and final sponsor, our good friends at HelloPillow, H-U-L-L-O.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:21.980]  Have you ever tried, what a HelloPillow is,
[02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.620]  is a buckwheat pillow.
[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:26.000]  They are totally different than the fluffy soft pillows
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.220]  that most of us are used to.
[02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:30.460]  They're sort of more like a bean bag
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:32.380]  and they're actually quite heavy.
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:34.340]  That sounds, if you're like me,
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:35.860]  before I ever heard of HelloPillow,
[02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:38.300]  sounds like the most ridiculous thing in the world
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.860]  that like pillowy actually means soft and fluffy
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:43.580]  in US English.
[02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:45.700]  But a HelloPillow is not like that at all.
[02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.780]  But guess what?
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:49.880]  All over the world, there's all sorts of places
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:52.300]  where pillows like this are normal
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:54.280]  and have been used for a long time.
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:57.680]  And instead of being filled with feathers or foam,
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:02.260]  it's filled with buckwheat and it tends to breathe better.
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:05.220]  And one of the aspects of it is like,
[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:06.940]  if you're the sort of person who like halfway
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:08.780]  through sleeping, you have to flip your pillow over
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:09.700]  to get a cool side,
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:11.880]  because the side you've been sleeping on is all hot,
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:13.400]  buckwheat pillows aren't like that.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.700]  They stay cool all night long.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:18.380]  And because they are sort of structured
[02:21:18.380 --> 02:21:21.000]  because of the beans, they support your head and neck.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.700]  And so again, if you're the sort of person
[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:24.380]  who always tries to sleep on two pillows
[02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:28.020]  to get it propped up, one buckwheat HelloPillow
[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:31.300]  is almost certainly all you need and it'll stay upright
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.580]  and give you all the support you need all night long.
[02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.440]  My family absolutely loves them.
[02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:39.920]  This was actually part of the problem of packing up a thing
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:42.700]  to take a kid to college is you really start running
[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:44.240]  out of space and you run out of weight
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.060]  and taking a heavier HelloPillow,
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.360]  other than a pillow that could be like vacuum sealed
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.140]  into a small bag, took up extra space that in theory,
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:54.460]  we didn't need, but trying to convince my son
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:57.340]  that he wasn't gonna have his HelloPillow was a no-go.
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.860]  That's how much our family loves them.
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:02.900]  And they're made in the USA, right here in the USA
[02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:05.460]  with quality construction, great materials,
[02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:09.120]  certified organic cotton that is sewn for durability.
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:11.140]  And again, if you're skeptical, if you're like,
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:13.580]  this sounds crazy, this does not sound like any pillow
[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.900]  I've ever tried, you get to sleep on it for 60 nights,
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:18.820]  two months, and if it's not for you,
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:20.860]  you can just ship it back and they will give you
[02:22:20.860 --> 02:22:23.540]  a full refund, no questions asked.
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:28.540]  Go to HelloPillow, H-U-L-L-O-P-I-L-L-O-W.
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:32.780]  HelloPillow.com slash the talk show.
[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:36.580]  If you try more than one pillow, you get a discount
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:39.540]  of up to 20 bucks per pillow, depending on the size.
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:40.940]  And if you don't like either of them,
[02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:42.060]  you can send them both back.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.220]  So try two, you get a discount of up to 20 bucks per pillow,
[02:22:45.220 --> 02:22:46.620]  depending on the size.
[02:22:46.620 --> 02:22:48.660]  Free, fast shipping on every order.
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.040]  And 1% of all their profits are donated
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:53.540]  to The Nature Conservancy.
[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:55.360]  And you can even give the gift of better sleep.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.500]  It is a great gift for your friends and family.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:23:00.660]  Go to HelloPillow.com slash the talk show.
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:03.080]  Quick bonus, before we talk The Verge,
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:05.820]  we could talk about the other stuff that was announced
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.080]  at the event.
[02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:09.220]  There's the Apple Watch Series 8, which I think
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:13.020]  is the most boring year over year update ever.
[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:14.700]  Yeah, there's not a lot there.
[02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:17.900]  Crash detection and the temperature sensor,
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:19.940]  which is at the moment really only used,
[02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:21.340]  I mean, again, not to underplay it,
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.180]  it sounds like a great feature for people
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:24.780]  who are trying to get pregnant
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:28.520]  for the retrospective ovulation detection,
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:32.060]  but otherwise doesn't seem to really do much.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:33.600]  Yeah, I think Apple's in a weird spot
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:35.180]  where they haven't gotten the things
[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:37.380]  they would like to get FDA approved yet.
[02:23:37.380 --> 02:23:39.540]  See, and there's some apps and devices
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:42.820]  that can predict, not just retrospectively.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:43.740]  So I think Apple needs to get there.
[02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:46.980]  But yeah, that one, to me, I think Victoria's review
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:48.840]  is like, if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 by this one,
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:51.100]  everything else you're gonna get with watchOS.
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.580]  Yeah, yeah, and that's just the nature of devices, right?
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:23:57.860]  You have these go-go years where there's low-hanging fruit
[02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:00.260]  and you get amazing year over year improvements,
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:03.580]  but calling it the Series 8, it's great.
[02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:05.140]  Now, that's one thing I hate about the iPhone,
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.340]  where they've had all those years where they just added
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:12.340]  an S, and so the iPhone 14 is not the 14th iPhone, right?
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:18.300]  You have, I guess the A series chips have the right number,
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:22.100]  like the A16 is the right number, maybe, I don't know.
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:24.300]  But at least Series 8, the Apple Watch,
[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:25.940]  eh, I don't have much to say about it.
[02:24:25.940 --> 02:24:28.100]  But the other watch, wow.
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:32.020]  Yeah, I mean, we looked at it hands-on.
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:34.140]  The one thing I did that made everybody mad
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:36.660]  was I immediately tried to put my third-party band on it.
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.180]  And I can confirm it works.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.180]  The third-party bands are a little weird.
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:41.260]  But yeah, they've done it right.
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:44.700]  The thing that gets me that I am eager to see,
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:48.540]  you know, they've added all the modes for the extreme sports
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.940]  but it's just a huge display, right?
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:55.140]  And they haven't really changed watchOS
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:58.060]  to take advantage of this bigger display.
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:24:59.420]  Like, it's just bigger.
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.460]  And I don't know, we'll see.
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:04.900]  It seems in the way that,
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:09.060]  and I know that they've tweaked the numbers scrupulously
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:10.500]  over the years to the millimeter
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.260]  where it was originally 38 and 42
[02:25:13.260 --> 02:25:17.700]  and then 40 and 44 and now 41 and 45.
[02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:18.980]  But there've been two sizes
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:21.900]  of the regular Series Apple Watches,
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.260]  the smaller one and the bigger one.
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:28.900]  And they've always shown the same UI scaled
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:31.660]  and that has always seemed appropriate, right?
[02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:35.100]  It's just smaller fonts, smaller hands, smaller details
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:36.220]  for a smaller watch.
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:40.700]  And that has always seemed to me appropriate.
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:42.260]  My wife uses a smaller one.
[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:43.380]  I use the bigger one.
[02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:44.740]  And I've played around with both
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:45.740]  and that's always seemed fine.
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:49.300]  This one, the fact that almost everything they show
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:52.900]  is really just the same thing scaled up even bigger
[02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:57.900]  seems from my first impressions to be limited, right?
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:00.660]  Like if this were the only Apple Watch
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:02.580]  and it were this size,
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:05.660]  wouldn't there be the ability to use it more
[02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:08.900]  like a little mini Dick Tracy computer on your wrist?
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.220]  Yeah, we have a great start on our site
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:12.700]  from the Vergecast, a director of audio production,
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:13.540]  Andrew Murray now.
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:15.700]  He's like, just let me watch TV on this thing.
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.660]  It, from the hands-on area.
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:18.500]  It's right there.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:20.940]  It looks like you could credibly watch video on it,
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:21.780]  honestly.
[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:22.620]  Yeah.
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:25.140]  Like, why not let me just run YouTube TV
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:26.580]  or the Apple TV app on it?
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:28.020]  Well, and I know that-
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:28.860]  Talk about Packers games.
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:31.060]  If I could just stream a Packers game to it,
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:31.900]  I'd be great.
[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:32.740]  Yeah.
[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:33.820]  The aspect ratio of the Apple Watch
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:36.820]  isn't quite like a phone, but it is vertical.
[02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:40.660]  So, and so much video today, especially short-form video.
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:42.660]  Instagram reels on the Apple Watch.
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.500]  Here we go.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:44.340]  Yeah.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:46.740]  So all the short-form video there,
[02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:48.180]  in fact, even this morning,
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:51.340]  I just read a story on the Verge about how the growth
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:55.220]  in like the top 50 channels on YouTube are like
[02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:58.620]  all the growing areas of the top channels on YouTube
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:01.100]  are in the short YouTube shorts.
[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:01.940]  Yeah.
[02:27:01.940 --> 02:27:05.620]  Boy, you could credibly watch that on this watch.
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:07.100]  Destroy the battery.
[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:10.060]  Well, but it has a bigger battery.
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:12.100]  They say it's like double the battery life.
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:13.860]  So why not let us do those things?
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:18.500]  And even if it turns this watch into half the battery life
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:19.660]  that they're promising,
[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:21.860]  because you're dicking around watching video on it all day,
[02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:24.260]  you'd still get the one day battery life
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:27.460]  that the other Apple Watches have always promised.
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:30.500]  The other thing that really struck me about it,
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:32.580]  there's the size, it is,
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:35.100]  the screen is surprisingly bigger to me
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:37.500]  than the other ones.
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:41.020]  And the fact that it's perfectly flat
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:45.140]  is oddly surprising difference to me.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:48.380]  I thought the edge would be taller.
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:49.340]  I thought so too.
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:52.420]  And in fact, I didn't even think it was raised at all
[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:55.660]  at first until one of the Apple blue shirt people
[02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:58.380]  in the hands-on area said, no, no, it is raised.
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:00.180]  And then I used my fingernail and I could say,
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:01.580]  oh yeah, it is.
[02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:04.660]  But it doesn't seem raised enough to be protective
[02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:07.900]  in the way that I thought it would be for rock climbing.
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:10.460]  Yeah, in the way that they're saying it is.
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.620]  I wonder if there's cases for like a regular Apple Watch.
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:13.460]  I see them all the time.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:14.300]  I feel bad for the people who wear them.
[02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:17.220]  The idea of putting a case on this one is ridiculous.
[02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:20.380]  I think people are going to put it in a case though.
[02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:21.580]  I really do.
[02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:24.060]  And it's like somehow Apple's like,
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:27.380]  we just can't bring ourselves to really raise the ridge.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:30.180]  And I guess the other thing too is that they do want
[02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:34.940]  this one big ultra watch to appeal both to the people
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.940]  who actually want to take it on extreme adventures
[02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:42.900]  and the people who aren't going to do anything extreme
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:45.900]  with it at all, but just like the look and idea
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:49.260]  of this type of big chunky watch.
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:51.420]  But in that case, you don't really want it.
[02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:53.940]  But when you look and I've spent the week looking
[02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:56.540]  at lots of other Garmins and G-shocks
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:28:59.620]  and Coros apparently is really the brand.
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:02.220]  I know everybody, I talk about Garmin all the time,
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:05.380]  but Coros apparently is the brand that really might be
[02:29:05.380 --> 02:29:08.060]  their number one competitor for this action space.
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:10.500]  But if you look at how raised the bezel is
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:13.340]  around those watches, it's really protective.
[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.020]  I always go back to the famously.
[02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:16.820]  I don't, you're probably too young.
[02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:18.980]  I know you and Ben are about the same age,
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:20.900]  just seven or eight years younger than me.
[02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:24.940]  But I remember when the first Casio G-shocks came out
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:27.980]  and it was like, I don't know, 81, 82, 83,
[02:29:27.980 --> 02:29:29.180]  somewhere around there.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:32.740]  And of course they put the ads all over sports on TV.
[02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:35.100]  So I saw the ad over and over and over again,
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:36.820]  watching sports as a kid.
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:39.980]  And it was, they wrapped the G-Shock around a hockey puck
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:43.780]  and had a hockey player slap shot it into the goal
[02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:46.180]  or into the goalie's mitt and then show
[02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:50.220]  that the watch was perfectly fine after being slapshotted.
[02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:52.300]  This does not look to me like you'd want to do that
[02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:53.460]  with this watch.
[02:29:53.460 --> 02:29:54.940]  No, not even a little bit.
[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:58.900]  I mean, just cause, yeah, G-Shock's like very plastic.
[02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:00.740]  It was a, it's a, it was a fantastic,
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:02.700]  it's a commercial that was indelible to me.
[02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:04.700]  Cause I also thought digital watches were super cool
[02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:05.520]  when I was a kid.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:08.540]  And I was allowed to buy like a $22 Casio.
[02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:09.860]  And it was the coolest thing in the world.
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:11.740]  One of my favorite things as a kid
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:14.900]  was a 20 something dollar Casio digital watch.
[02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:17.380]  I wanted the G-Shock though, which was, I don't know,
[02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:19.140]  a hundred bucks in my, rightly so,
[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:21.340]  aren't going to buy a kid a hundred dollar watch,
[02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:23.900]  but I wanted it so bad cause that seems so cool.
[02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:26.940]  And it's, it's like the Volvo being driven off a building.
[02:30:27.820 --> 02:30:31.100]  It's like a slap shot, hockey slap shot of a watch
[02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:33.060]  really seemed like, man, that's a demo.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:34.360]  I'm not saying that they, you know,
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:36.220]  that Apple should have or that they botched it.
[02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:38.260]  It's just not quite what I was expecting.
[02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:43.340]  Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of, again,
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:44.820]  this is an early adopter special.
[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:47.140]  Like I think people are going to be excited about it.
[02:30:47.140 --> 02:30:50.340]  And I think we're a year away from knowing.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:53.180]  Even the one app, which is very unlike Apple
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:55.380]  to partner with a third party for a core capability
[02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:56.740]  that they're advertising,
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:30:58.140]  but they're partnering with this company
[02:30:58.140 --> 02:31:00.300]  to make Oceanic Plus, the scuba diving app.
[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:02.140]  It's not out yet.
[02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.900]  Like Apple's dependent on a third party to ship an app
[02:31:05.900 --> 02:31:08.540]  to make its own like diving band.
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:10.260]  I spent a surprise.
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:11.820]  I didn't know that it wasn't out yet.
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.700]  And I was, while writing my review,
[02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:16.420]  I spent a surprising amount of time trying to find that app
[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:18.980]  because I thought it would be very easy to find.
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.020]  No, we'll see.
[02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:23.620]  So there's like a lot of this where it's,
[02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:26.740]  what does a year of development now that people have it
[02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:29.700]  and their expectations will be real look like?
[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:32.260]  Because my early impression is,
[02:31:32.260 --> 02:31:34.000]  well, I'm going to buy the shit out of this watch.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.460]  It looks cool as hell.
[02:31:35.460 --> 02:31:36.980]  I'm a sucker.
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:39.020]  And I'm excited to have a longer battery life
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:40.340]  and I love a big screen.
[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:42.500]  And you like a big chunky watch too.
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:44.580]  Yeah. And I, yeah, I'm a big dude.
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:46.460]  A big chunky watch works for me.
[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:47.660]  And it's like, is there going to do any,
[02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:49.820]  like, am I going to look at two factor codes?
[02:31:49.820 --> 02:31:51.660]  Like that's what I do with my watch.
[02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:52.500]  I'm just going to be huge now.
[02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:54.000]  What I love doing with my watch is having my Mac
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.660]  when I'm at my desk and I don't have touch ID
[02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:58.220]  because I use a standalone keyboard.
[02:31:58.220 --> 02:32:00.460]  I love just having my Mac unlock.
[02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:02.100]  That's my main Apple watch use.
[02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:02.940]  You know what else?
[02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:04.860]  I'm going to steal this from my friend, Austin Mann.
[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:06.780]  I know he has a review out with the phone.
[02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:08.260]  I think he was in the Highlands of Scotland.
[02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:10.340]  I haven't looked at it yet as a record,
[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:13.540]  but Austin gave me this idea at the hands-on area.
[02:32:13.540 --> 02:32:16.860]  This is again, the utility of bouncing into people
[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:19.300]  in the hands-on area after these keynotes
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:21.460]  is the Apple watch ultra.
[02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:23.640]  One of the things that does that the other watches don't do
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:25.300]  is you can turn the digital crown
[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:28.340]  and it turns the display into a,
[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:29.940]  no matter which watch face you're wearing,
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:33.760]  it goes black and the only pixels are red
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:37.260]  because that's the ones that disrupt your retinas the least
[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:38.540]  for nighttime viewing.
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.260]  And Austin of course thought,
[02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:45.820]  I wish I had that mode for the camera on the phone.
[02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:48.220]  And it's like, oh, wouldn't that be cool, right?
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:50.580]  So they do all this night mode stuff with the camera.
[02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:52.660]  Wouldn't it be great if you could put the iPhone camera
[02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:55.820]  into a red pixels on a black background node?
[02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:56.660]  That is really cool.
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:57.980]  I have that mode in,
[02:32:57.980 --> 02:32:59.740]  I don't remember what stargazing app I have,
[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:01.100]  but I have one of those cool iPhone apps
[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.500]  that you point at the sky and it tells you
[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:05.460]  where the stars are and finds the constellations for you.
[02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:08.020]  And that has a red mode and it's actually super sick.
[02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:10.340]  AirPods Pro, I don't know what to say about them.
[02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:12.580]  They're not out yet, but it seems like a great idea.
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:14.300]  It's one of my favorite Apple products.
[02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:16.780]  The findable case and findable earbuds
[02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:17.860]  seems like a great idea.
[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:19.020]  I tend not to lose mine,
[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:20.840]  but when I do every time I'm annoyed
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:23.780]  because I know how much stuff is findable
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:25.300]  in Apple's ecosystem now.
[02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:28.520]  And the one thing I tend to misplace is not,
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:29.660]  well, problem solved.
[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:32.260]  I will upgrade just for the findability.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:33.100]  Oh, wow.
[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:35.340]  I did a round of questions about,
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:37.140]  well, you're saying there's better audio quality.
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:39.480]  Like, is it still Bluetooth?
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:40.700]  Do you upgrade?
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:42.980]  Are you doing some proprietary stuff with more bandwidth?
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.860]  It's still Bluetooth, apparently.
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:45.700]  I think that-
[02:33:45.700 --> 02:33:47.180]  You're doing codec improvements.
[02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:48.500]  Yeah, I don't ask about that
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.060]  because number one, my ears aren't great.
[02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:51.980]  I've never really owned a pair of headphones
[02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:53.980]  that I've really thought sounded bad.
[02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:57.100]  And it's like, as picky as I get it, it's me.
[02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:59.160]  It's me, it's my ears, it's my taste.
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:01.900]  Because I'm the guy who really, really hates
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:05.300]  and gets angry and blogs about the use of Arial
[02:34:05.300 --> 02:34:06.760]  instead of Helvetica,
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.580]  knowing that 99% of people cannot tell the difference
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:12.220]  between Arial and Helvetica.
[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.580]  So I get it that other people can do,
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:15.980]  what I can do with fonts,
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:17.460]  other people can do with headphones.
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:18.300]  I get it.
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:19.240]  I just don't.
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.780]  So I don't really care about that.
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:25.360]  And I think uncompressed audio is a scam.
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:28.540]  But I mean, Apple definitely thinks that.
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:30.460]  Yeah, but I think it's a scam,
[02:34:30.460 --> 02:34:32.540]  especially if you're playing it in earbuds,
[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:37.380]  not big, open-eared, over-the-head cans.
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:38.220]  So I don't care.
[02:34:38.220 --> 02:34:42.180]  I don't care that the AirPods don't support lossless audio.
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:44.860]  But I guess some people do.
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:46.740]  Yeah, and I think all this facial audio stuff
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:47.940]  just makes no sense to me.
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:49.060]  I do think it's,
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:52.220]  speaking from things that we could say from being there,
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:54.340]  it's preposterous to me
[02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:57.020]  how many hundreds of pairs of AirPods Pro
[02:34:57.020 --> 02:34:58.820]  they had in the hands-on area for us to try.
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:00.500]  Yes, it was amazing.
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:02.020]  There are people with boxes.
[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:05.700]  Just boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes of them.
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:08.580]  And so, and they encourage you.
[02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:10.180]  They're begging you, try them, please.
[02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:12.580]  And I'm like, ah, and they're like, they're fresh.
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:13.660]  Nobody's ever worn them.
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:16.940]  And you put them on and you try them.
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.900]  And they're all, I don't even know how they do it.
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:20.900]  They're all prepared to somebody's phone
[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:23.380]  and they can play some music for you.
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:25.620]  And you're like, yeah, this is great.
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:26.820]  I played with the volume
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:28.980]  and it seems like that touch swiping
[02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:31.680]  for volume up, volume down seems pretty cool.
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:34.860]  I like the way that only the ear you swipe on
[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:37.500]  gets the little bip bip bip as you go up and down.
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:39.120]  So if you swipe on your right ear,
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.440]  it's your right earbud only that makes the little bip.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:43.720]  And then you take them off
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:45.580]  and you hand them back to the nice person
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:47.580]  and somebody else puts them in a different case
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:48.780]  and they take them away.
[02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:51.600]  Presumably to be cleaned.
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.500]  I didn't ask, I did not even ask,
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:55.500]  but they emphasized that all the ones
[02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:58.180]  that they were letting us try were not cleaned.
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:00.320]  They had all, they were all factory fresh
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:02.460]  and had never touched human ears.
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.540]  Now, did they throw them all away?
[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:07.860]  I sure hope not because somebody would buy them, right?
[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:11.100]  After cleaning a spritz with some alcohol
[02:36:11.100 --> 02:36:12.540]  and who wouldn't want to buy
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:15.460]  worn for 30 second AirPods Pro.
[02:36:15.460 --> 02:36:16.900]  I don't know, I would love to know
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.900]  what the hell they did with them,
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:22.080]  but they were swearing up and down that every single pair
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:24.800]  and there were hundreds and hundreds of people there all,
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:26.480]  and they're encouraging everybody to try it.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:27.760]  It is, it's ridiculous.
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:30.580]  And of course the trays were custom designed.
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:33.460]  Yes, they were, I mean, it was,
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:35.780]  I wish I had had more time to just be like,
[02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:37.060]  I just don't know right about this.
[02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:41.100]  All right, we got to talk Verge redesign.
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:41.940]  Let's do it.
[02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:43.940]  How many font criticisms do you have?
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.540]  Yeah, I'm gonna say this
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:47.620]  because of how busy I've been the last week.
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:48.540]  Now you were nice enough.
[02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:51.340]  You again, hands-on time, friends,
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:55.160]  you showed it to me last week in the hands-on area.
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:56.340]  On a phone, mind you.
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:59.740]  Well, is it phone, here's my first question for you.
[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:02.380]  Was the phone the first target of the Verge redesign?
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:04.120]  Oh, easily.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.820]  Yeah, I think if you worked at a large media company,
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:10.800]  everyone is deeply aware of the statistics
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:12.620]  of mobile users versus desktop users.
[02:37:12.620 --> 02:37:14.860]  The Verge is an outlier, right?
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:16.820]  So we are, I think our numbers are basically
[02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:21.820]  70% mobile, 25% desktop, 5% tablet,
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.660]  plus or minus one percentage, depending on the month.
[02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:27.500]  For the rest of the country, it's like 90-10.
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:28.420]  Really?
[02:37:28.420 --> 02:37:29.340]  Wow.
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:30.600]  This is like every media company.
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:32.260]  Wow, I'm out of touch.
[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:34.980]  And my numbers are...
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:39.580]  Well, I've been majority mobile though for years.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:40.980]  I mean, last time I looked.
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:42.980]  I hardly ever look at my stats,
[02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:45.380]  and of course it's ridiculous and preposterous
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:46.900]  and embarrassing, and we won't go into it,
[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:50.380]  that even though even Daring Fireball is mobile first only,
[02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:53.100]  it still doesn't have a mobile design
[02:37:53.100 --> 02:37:55.880]  other than double tapping the main column to zoom it in.
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:56.720]  I like it.
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:58.700]  I don't think you should ever change it, to be honest with you.
[02:37:58.700 --> 02:37:59.540]  Well...
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:00.380]  I don't know about that.
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:01.460]  Never say never, right?
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:03.480]  But it works, but I get it.
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:05.460]  But yeah, all right, so mobile first.
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.540]  I don't hate the fonts.
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:08.900]  I see that you're getting some hate for them.
[02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:10.300]  But here's where I'm going with that,
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:11.820]  is I've been so busy this week.
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:13.660]  You were kind enough to show it to me last week,
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:16.940]  kind enough to give me the basic idea of what you're doing,
[02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:19.460]  which I love, of course, unsurprisingly.
[02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:21.340]  But I haven't been reading enough.
[02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:23.540]  I read more of The Verge this morning
[02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:25.420]  in preparation for the show than I had
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:29.940]  from when I first flew out to California until now,
[02:38:29.940 --> 02:38:31.700]  because I've been so busy.
[02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:34.660]  And I'm of the opinion that you need some time
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.100]  before you can pass judgment on typefaces and stuff.
[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:38.860]  I think the main typeface is fine, though.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:39.940]  I don't know why people...
[02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:41.220]  I keep hearing people keep saying,
[02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:44.220]  I can't wait for Gruber to comment on the font
[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:46.120]  and The Verge redesign.
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:47.700]  I don't quite get it.
[02:38:47.700 --> 02:38:52.460]  I know the headline font is opinionated,
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:55.060]  but the stuff for actual reading,
[02:38:55.980 --> 02:38:58.500]  I don't see what the objection is.
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:38:59.580]  Am I missing something?
[02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:01.020]  I've been trying to suss it out.
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:02.380]  So one, the idea...
[02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:04.060]  There's more than a little daring fireball
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:06.020]  in this whole design, right?
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.180]  Dieter and I are walking around being like,
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:09.100]  fuck it, Gruber can just post to us on website
[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:09.920]  whenever he wants to.
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:10.760]  Why can't we?
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:14.220]  So that's the heart of it.
[02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:16.380]  Why are we posting to Twitter instead of our own website?
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:18.300]  So we just wanted to build a lighter weight thing
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:20.580]  and then we think we should blow up The Verge
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:21.420]  every few years.
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:24.140]  That's just part of the DNA of the place.
[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:25.780]  We should be as much on the cutting edge.
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:27.420]  We should be product...
[02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:28.940]  If we're gonna pass judgment on products,
[02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:30.500]  we should run a product.
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:31.340]  That's how I feel about it.
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:33.300]  So I think that builds empathy for me
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:35.020]  and all the product managers in the world.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:37.220]  So yeah, to me, I'm trying to figure it out
[02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:39.420]  and the main thing,
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:40.940]  people keep saying there's too many fonts.
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:41.980]  There's only three.
[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:44.640]  I didn't see too many fonts either.
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:45.480]  I did not.
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.780]  That's the thing that always jumps out to me.
[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:49.940]  So I would say I agree.
[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:51.180]  Yeah, there's Manuka,
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:52.860]  which is a really big opinionated one
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:54.620]  that we're using pretty sparingly.
[02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:56.340]  There's PolySands, which is just beautiful.
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.060]  It's hard to complain about it.
[02:39:58.060 --> 02:40:00.540]  And there's FKRoman, which is just a nice tariff.
[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:03.780]  I think we have lots of different weights going on.
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:05.180]  Like it's the first version.
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:09.860]  We shipped the thing that was done enough to ship.
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:12.260]  By next week, we will be iterating on it.
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:13.500]  Everyone just needs a break.
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:15.100]  We spent two years working on it,
[02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:16.860]  but really we spent like 20 minutes
[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:18.620]  sprinting it out the door, right?
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:20.980]  So we're, and the last six months in particular
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:22.380]  have been like a dead sprint.
[02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:23.580]  So everyone just needed a break this week.
[02:40:23.580 --> 02:40:25.260]  Ship it, we got to see how it feels.
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:26.720]  You were talking about the student newspaper.
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:27.940]  Like there's this big,
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:31.100]  there's a weird spectrum of things
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:32.640]  that I don't quite know how to describe,
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:36.820]  but for editorial products or content products,
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:39.300]  there's like PageMaker,
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:41.660]  where we run New York Magazine.
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:42.540]  I don't even know what software they use
[02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:43.620]  to lay out the print magazine,
[02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:45.680]  but New York Magazine is part of Vox Media.
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.180]  I think I could say with certainty they use InDesign,
[02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.780]  but I might be wrong.
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:51.060]  No, it's something else, and I forget the name.
[02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:51.900]  Oh, is it really?
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:52.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:54.200]  It's some piece of software that helps them
[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:55.040]  lay out the print product.
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.580]  And like the writers submit Word docs,
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:40:59.740]  and then like a designer lays out the print magazine,
[02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:00.780]  and that's the end of it.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:02.660]  And then way on the other end of the spectrum
[02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:05.260]  is like YouTube, right?
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:06.860]  And if you think there's too many fonts
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:07.700]  in the version.com,
[02:41:07.700 --> 02:41:10.020]  like just open YouTube on your phone,
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:11.180]  and it's like Fontapalooza,
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:13.700]  because all the thumbnails are crazy.
[02:41:13.700 --> 02:41:15.460]  And so like YouTube designs itself
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:17.780]  to just be filled in by other people
[02:41:17.780 --> 02:41:19.940]  without any control.
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:23.340]  The Verge product is like in the middle of that,
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:24.820]  in like a very real way,
[02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:27.280]  because we have a product team and designers
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:28.220]  that are opinionated,
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:29.060]  and they want to lay it out,
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:30.220]  and it wants to look right.
[02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:32.740]  And then now they have handed it over
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:35.140]  to a hundred person newsroom,
[02:41:35.140 --> 02:41:37.100]  and an art team, and a video team
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:38.660]  that are just doing stuff.
[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:41.860]  And there's communication there,
[02:41:41.860 --> 02:41:43.420]  but there's just no way,
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.400]  there was no way for me personally
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.180]  to know how it would really look
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:49.580]  until a hundred people started publishing into it.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:50.980]  Right, right.
[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:51.880]  And so like, sure,
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:52.820]  like it's a little,
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:55.300]  it's not quite what we expected.
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:41:57.460]  It does not look like the Figma mock
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:41:59.500]  that I have open in the other tab.
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:03.860]  We published into it for about six months in staging,
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:05.700]  but we weren't writing short posts,
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:07.500]  because I can't tell a hundred person newsroom,
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:09.880]  like published to nowhere.
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:10.720]  Right.
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:11.540]  Yeah, you can't.
[02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:13.180]  It's just like a waste of time.
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:14.160]  So we did it with a small group.
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:16.620]  So we just like had these ideas,
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:18.340]  and like most of them are playing out
[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:19.160]  the way we think they are.
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:20.140]  Some of them are not.
[02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:21.660]  Do I wish we shipped light mode right away?
[02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:22.500]  Of course I do.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:23.320]  Do it like,
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:24.460]  do I think we should delineate
[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:26.940]  some of these links a little bit better?
[02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:27.760]  Yeah, I do.
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:31.000]  Like if you sat with something for six months,
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.180]  you forget that not everyone understands it
[02:42:33.180 --> 02:42:35.540]  the way that you see it.
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:36.380]  And so like,
[02:42:36.380 --> 02:42:38.460]  I think some of the criticism is perfectly on point.
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:41.360]  We can make the product explain itself better.
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:42.400]  But fundamentally,
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:47.220]  am I thrilled that I just like linked out to that story
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:48.740]  you're talking about YouTube channels
[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:50.660]  and like where the growth is coming?
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:53.580]  I read that story in Tube Builder once a week.
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:54.860]  Here's the top 50.
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:55.700]  Yep.
[02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:56.780]  And there's no reason for me
[02:42:56.780 --> 02:42:58.380]  to write a Verge article about it.
[02:42:58.380 --> 02:42:59.780]  Yep. Nope.
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:01.380]  But now I can just like link to them
[02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:04.120]  and like show our massive audience,
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:07.920]  hey, here's this resource that I think about all the time.
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:09.000]  And I think that's like,
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:10.380]  that's the best of the internet.
[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:11.940]  Like that's how it should work.
[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:14.060]  We linked to Wired today.
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:17.960]  I know and love and trust a lot of journalists at Wired.
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:20.100]  There's no reason that we should just pretend
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:21.340]  they don't exist.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.980]  And so like that's the best of Daring Fireball.
[02:43:22.980 --> 02:43:23.820]  That's like,
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:25.700]  that's where we came from at Engadget.
[02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:27.940]  We were a link blog for a long time.
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:29.740]  We should just keep doing it.
[02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:31.420]  Like we should bring that back.
[02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:35.180]  And the biggest victory to me is like
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:37.860]  for a couple of minutes in 2022,
[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:40.520]  everyone argued about a desktop homepage.
[02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:45.300]  Like I did it, like I don't feel bad about it.
[02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:47.500]  Like no one else has argued about a desktop homepage
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:48.820]  like this in a very long time.
[02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:52.300]  So I'm happy to just make everybody consider,
[02:43:52.300 --> 02:43:54.700]  oh, there's a lot of value to these kinds of pages
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:56.540]  and these kinds of experiences,
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:58.700]  as opposed to if you work in publishing,
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:01.060]  everyone's like, what's your Discord strategy?
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:03.060]  And it's like, I don't know, somebody else runs that shit.
[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:05.020]  Like not me.
[02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:06.460]  I told you some of this in person,
[02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:10.060]  but I have to repeat it because we weren't recording
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:11.540]  when you showed it to me.
[02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:14.540]  But I of course love it.
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:16.480]  I love the philosophy.
[02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:19.260]  I don't, I don't even, but I don't, I don't, I know,
[02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:22.580]  I get, I've always gotten the verge, I think, very well.
[02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:25.660]  Ever since you guys were jumped out of Engadget
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:27.820]  and what was the temporary site called?
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:28.820]  This Is My Next.
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:30.820]  Yeah, This Is My Next, right.
[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:31.780]  I should have remembered that
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.980]  because I actually listened to you on Ben's podcast
[02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:37.020]  at Stratechery where that even came up.
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:40.120]  And I know it wasn't like a name you abandoned.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:42.500]  It was a placeholder name while you built the real thing,
[02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:43.340]  which was great though.
[02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:46.500]  But that's the mentality that you guys have had all along,
[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:49.220]  which is let's not wait until we get the thing
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:50.940]  we really want to build going.
[02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:53.980]  Let's get something else up so we can keep publishing.
[02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:57.240]  And that mentality is still, that's the verge.
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:59.640]  And it's great.
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:03.880]  It's, but this is so much better because,
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.920]  and I know you said, I don't want to repeat it all,
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:08.520]  but I guess, I think it's a paid podcast at Stratechery.
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:10.000]  So I guess we can steal it, but.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.160]  He's your business partner, man.
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:13.000]  Yeah.
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:16.360]  He won't mind.
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:19.520]  No, but you told Ben that the homepage of the verge
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:21.400]  is unlike a lot of other properties.
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.640]  And I guess unlike everything else at Vox, a destination.
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:25.480]  Yep.
[02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:27.020]  Well, there's, there's where, okay,
[02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:28.160]  there's a hundred different people
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.360]  contributing to the verge
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:31.960]  and there's one person who's contributed
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:34.640]  to Daring Fireball over 20 years.
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:39.160]  So there's some big difference on contributor number scale.
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:42.840]  But that's one thing your site and my site share
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:45.840]  is my homepage is an enormous destination.
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:49.200]  I actually, I don't look at analytics very frequently,
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:53.960]  but I get enormous, I always have, still do,
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:57.200]  enormous amount of homepage traffic.
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200]  And I've always been very proud of that.
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:02.800]  And as other websites over the years
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:05.160]  between when I started 20 years ago
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:08.160]  and where we are today and the trends coming around to it,
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:09.200]  I've always thought,
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:11.600]  boy, that's a really weird thing to move away from
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.440]  because once people have had a habit
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:17.020]  of coming to your homepage,
[02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:19.440]  why would you make homepage design decisions
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:20.800]  to turn them off?
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:23.280]  Like you've, that the hardest thing in the world
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:27.980]  is to gain traction because no matter what it is,
[02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:31.000]  gaining traction is a mystery.
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.960]  And there are, there are,
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.080]  I think ultimately something that really ultimately
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:39.520]  deserves to succeed will succeed eventually.
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:42.240]  But it might take longer than the people
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:44.680]  or person making it thinks it ought to
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:46.100]  and maybe then it deserves.
[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:49.000]  And sometimes something catches fire
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.640]  and it has its moment, its viral moment
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:53.200]  and gains traction early.
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:55.720]  And you can't explain why that happens.
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:59.260]  But man, once you've got it, keep it.
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:00.960]  And if you've got a readership
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:03.360]  that likes coming to your homepage,
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:05.880]  your homepage should keep making them happy.
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:10.880]  And so many publications over the last 15 years
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:12.640]  made change.
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:15.320]  And I don't think The Verge ever had a bad homepage.
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.360]  But like you said to Ben,
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.800]  it was sometimes a mystery to you
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:20.200]  why so many people were coming
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.600]  because you'd have sort of like a menu of,
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.080]  hey, here's like the eight feature stories
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:28.760]  that we're highlighting right now.
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:30.560]  And they're not gonna change that frequently
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.600]  throughout the day because, you know,
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:36.960]  how many times are Verge written stories going to come out?
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:38.400]  Yeah, so we write a lot.
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:40.960]  We write between like 35 and 50 stories a day.
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:45.080]  And like what I was getting from our old home page
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:47.360]  is it was like a list of facts.
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:48.760]  Like, I don't know, like even our,
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:50.760]  because we were using it the same way,
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.880]  we were, our headlines were starting to get more boring,
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:53.960]  which is weird.
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:55.760]  Like it's a weird feedback loop.
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:56.960]  Like you open the homepage and it's like,
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:59.080]  here's a list of things that happened today.
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:00.520]  And you could like close it.
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:02.960]  And you kind of like had a summary
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:05.120]  and then you could pick the one that you wanted.
[02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:07.920]  I think it's really weird to bring people into a homepage
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:10.600]  and then immediately ask them to leave.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:12.560]  Yeah, it's just strange to me.
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.520]  And it was, that's where we were and it's fine.
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:15.720]  So we have a big homepage.
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:17.080]  It's a unique asset immediately.
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:19.320]  It's like, literally it's like us,
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.480]  you, CNN, the New York Times,
[02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:23.320]  like those are the home pages in media.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:25.480]  And Drudge, don't forget Drudge.
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:27.000]  And Drudge, Drudge will drive an enormous,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.640]  and like Craigslist.
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:30.800]  It's like this weird collection of brands
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.480]  that have direct homepage audience at scale.
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:36.040]  And I'm leaving out like obviously like youtube.com.
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:38.040]  I mean like actual publisher homepages.
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:39.880]  And we just have a bigger,
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:41.720]  like most publishers are like a percentage
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:43.120]  of their traffic comes off their own page.
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:45.200]  Ours is a massive percentage.
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.240]  So we were like, we should just make it worth
[02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:51.240]  coming back to one time a day while solving this problem
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:53.280]  of I see a bunch of cool shit.
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:55.960]  Like we have a bunch of online reporters.
[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:58.880]  We see cool things all the time.
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:01.320]  And sometimes the story is like Elon tweeted,
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:02.880]  look at the tweet.
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:06.200]  And we were burning like an hour going from,
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.240]  oh, the guy tweeted, do we have to write about this thing?
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:10.840]  Like what are the 500 words that justify
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:11.880]  our published process?
[02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:13.040]  And then putting, it's like,
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:14.560]  no, just show them the tweet and move on.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:15.440]  Yep.
[02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:17.880]  No, like we'll get there.
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:21.760]  What I would say to you is we do not think
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:23.160]  our design is perfect.
[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:26.040]  I do think we need a light mode where all those things
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.320]  are just like on a roadmap,
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:30.920]  but if we didn't ship it and get the feedback,
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:32.880]  we'd actually not know how to prioritize the roadmap.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:33.720]  No, I think you're right.
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:36.000]  I think it's exactly like I was saying with Apple shipping
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.160]  some of these computational photography features earlier
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.640]  rather than perfected like portrait mode
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:43.360]  and this year's action mode.
[02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:44.760]  Yeah, this is the worst action mode
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:46.120]  Apple's ever gonna ship,
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.560]  but it's worth shipping this year.
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:51.120]  It's good enough that it's worth shipping
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:52.720]  even though we have lots of complaints about it
[02:49:52.720 --> 02:49:55.680]  and it crops too much and it requires too much light.
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:57.520]  But it is good.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.560]  This design is clearly good enough to launch,
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:01.560]  more than good enough.
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:02.560]  And there are complaints.
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:04.280]  Yeah, sure, it should have a light mode.
[02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:05.120]  All right, whatever.
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:07.480]  But I don't even wanna talk about that.
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:09.280]  To me, it's the format.
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:13.480]  It's talking about it as a wireframe, right, is great.
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.920]  And the one thing I'm annoyed about is I've had an idea,
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:19.320]  and again, I'm a procrastinator
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:21.920]  and I do everything at my site myself, so it takes a while,
[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:26.720]  but I've had the idea of adding a new type
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  to the things I post where it would just be like an update,
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:36.400]  like where it would be something that would show up,
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:37.760]  or will, I'll say will,
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:38.760]  because I'll commit to shipping.
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:40.840]  I just won't tell you when.
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  But it would never be longer than like three fingers, right?
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:50.680]  And probably usually like one finger or two fingers,
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:53.800]  but just a little update so that if I update,
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:55.440]  like my post yesterday,
[02:50:55.440 --> 02:50:59.440]  my big, long, giant iPhone 14 Pro review,
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:01.160]  but I have to update it because maybe,
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:02.680]  let's say I get off this podcast with you
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:05.160]  and find out I made a terrible mistake or something,
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:08.200]  or I found out something and I need to update it.
[02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:11.080]  I'm gonna post the update in this article
[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:12.800]  that I published last night,
[02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:14.680]  and that anybody who's already read,
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:17.160]  it's 15 pages printed out,
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:21.000]  and they're not going to randomly go back to the article
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.480]  and scroll down halfway to the camera section
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:25.360]  just to see if I wrote an update.
[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:26.680]  But if I do update it,
[02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:28.760]  I would love to have that update on my homepage
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:33.000]  and say update, and it would just be like a new little item.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.440]  Anyway, now it's gonna look like
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:35.760]  I'm stealing from The Verge.
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:39.200]  Well, that would be the best compliment of all.
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:41.040]  Great artist steal, as I'm told.
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:44.760]  But yeah, look, we stole the first bit from you,
[02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:47.200]  so I'm not gonna be too worried about that.
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:49.080]  Nobody's gonna look at The Verge
[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:51.000]  and say it looks like a rip-off of Daring Fireball,
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.200]  and nobody's gonna look at my fragment thing
[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:54.960]  and say, oh my god,
[02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:56.760]  now the Daring Fireball looks like The Verge.
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:59.200]  So it's not, we're all friends here.
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:01.200]  And this is taking,
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:04.120]  everything is a remix, right?
[02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:06.520]  And this is using ideas from others
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:08.000]  to draw inspiration for yourself.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:09.800]  It's the best of creativity
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:12.200]  and taking ideas and building something new.
[02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:14.920]  Yeah, the quote that has been rattling
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:16.960]  through my head this week is like,
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:18.560]  it wasn't a Steve Jobs quote,
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:20.400]  it's like something, it's worth criticizing.
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.560]  Oh yeah, that's an Alan Kay thing.
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:25.640]  The Mac was the first computer worth criticizing.
[02:52:25.640 --> 02:52:27.760]  Yeah, look, there's been lots of websites worth criticizing.
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:31.160]  But the fact that people care enough
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:35.280]  to tweet at us about our desktop homepage
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:39.560]  is like, all right, we've accomplished the first goal,
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:41.320]  which is make something interesting
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:44.200]  that everyone will think about and have a think about.
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:45.800]  And the other thing that I keep thinking about,
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:48.000]  which is far more cynical and snarky,
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.920]  is Apple made us use iOS 7 for a full year.
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.200]  And we'll be a little bit faster than that.
[02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:58.840]  Yeah, because you're not on an annual schedule.
[02:52:58.840 --> 02:53:02.680]  Yeah, we're talking weeks before the first round
[02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:04.480]  of updates, I think, maybe even shorter than weeks
[02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:06.400]  in some ways, but you gotta,
[02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:08.260]  sometimes you gotta burn it all down, right?
[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:12.680]  iOS 7 burned it all down and they built it back up.
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:16.220]  And like, for me, it was the old,
[02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:18.720]  a lot of the things, we have an entirely new front end.
[02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:22.520]  It's actually, there's like a technological masterpiece
[02:53:22.520 --> 02:53:23.360]  at the heart of this.
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:27.160]  We run this content management system called Chorus.
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:28.360]  Chorus runs a lot of things.
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:30.800]  The Minneapolis Star Tribune is published on Chorus.
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:33.760]  And the big move a couple years ago
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:36.600]  was to make Chorus headless, so now it is served by API,
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:38.040]  which is a big thing.
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:40.400]  And then we built our own custom front end Chorus
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:43.220]  called Duet, which is, runs on Next.js.
[02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:48.220]  It's like this whole situation is like five, six teams
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:53.000]  at this huge company built the verge for us.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.280]  And you can see, the things you can do
[02:53:56.280 --> 02:54:00.240]  once you can serve the whole site via API,
[02:54:00.240 --> 02:54:04.000]  and then you can plug any API into your shiny,
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:08.560]  new technological Marvel front end is pretty wild, right?
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:11.480]  Like there's stuff we can do now that we would have never
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:14.480]  been able to do with our old, not just the old design,
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:17.280]  but the old tech stack of the verge.
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.200]  And so like, yeah, there's rough edges here,
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:22.720]  but it's all the beginnings of, oh, we burned the shit down
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:24.400]  and now we're gonna build it back up.
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:26.600]  I, it's what comes around goes around.
[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:29.240]  I've been talking about this privately with friends
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:34.240]  and people close to the 20 years I've been doing this
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:37.900]  where I, not like I sketched out the whole system,
[02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:39.780]  but I've been saying that a CMS,
[02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:43.940]  all CMSs should be designed headless by Fiat,
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:46.380]  not like, oh, it would be nice if you did it.
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:49.600]  But Amy Klobuchar, the headless CMS act of 2022.
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  Right, but every single CMS that is designed web first
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:56.240]  or anything else first,
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:54:59.200]  cause you could go back in time and find older CMSs
[02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:02.320]  from like the nineties when newspaper systems
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:05.500]  that were like dedicated weird terminal type things.
[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:07.240]  But you know, from the web era onward,
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:10.680]  anything that was designed as a web app first with,
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:12.880]  oh yeah, and we'll add APIs.
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:16.200]  You never, the APIs, you'd never do it right.
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:19.400]  And you make decisions in the web app
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:21.760]  that can't be API-ified.
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:24.800]  Whereas if it's all, if it has to be API first
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:29.320]  and the web is just the first and maybe most used client,
[02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:33.020]  then when new opportunities happen and new things happen,
[02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:34.260]  like, oh, guess what?
[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:38.520]  These fricking phones that came out starting in 2007
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:40.900]  are like, should be a client to the CMS,
[02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:43.960]  but our web app can't possibly be usable
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:45.380]  on this tiny little screen.
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:47.500]  It all is possible, right?
[02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:50.680]  And that you could make a client for the Apple watch ultra
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:52.200]  or something, I don't know.
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:54.140]  All sorts of things are possible that wouldn't be,
[02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:57.040]  or all of a sudden Twitter is a thing.
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.920]  We can connect our CMS to Twitter
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:00.500]  and it doesn't have to go through a web app.
[02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:03.040]  It just it's APIs, so it can all be automated,
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:07.840]  but that's, and it solves all the problems of blogging APIs
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:11.760]  where blogging clients like my beloved Mars Edit,
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:15.480]  there's so many that the APIs that it has to use all suck
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:18.600]  because they're all, it's not Mars at its fault.
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:21.240]  I love WordPress, I don't use it, but I love it
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:22.880]  and I'm so proud of WordPress
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:24.840]  and think it's such a great thing for the web
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:28.920]  that literally a majority of the websites in the world
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:32.740]  run on it, but it's web first and the APIs for WordPress
[02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:34.360]  will never be as good as they would be
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:37.240]  if there was something that was the API first.
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:40.440]  Twitter to me is the elephant in the room with this redesign
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:42.700]  in two different ways.
[02:56:42.700 --> 02:56:47.700]  The first way is like, you've said that,
[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:52.180]  hey, why are you, why is your staff,
[02:56:52.180 --> 02:56:54.140]  why is it easier for them to,
[02:56:54.140 --> 02:56:55.980]  if they just want to point out,
[02:56:55.980 --> 02:56:57.700]  like I'm looking at the Vergehead page here,
[02:56:57.700 --> 02:57:00.100]  Elizabeth Lapato tweeted earlier today
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:01.280]  before we started recording,
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:03.060]  oh, FedEx says a recession's coming.
[02:57:03.060 --> 02:57:04.320]  Why should that make you nervous?
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:08.080]  Well, Fed chair Alan Greenspan used to talk with FedEx
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:10.860]  every week for the FedEx indicator.
[02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:13.100]  In other words, he thought FedEx had its pulse
[02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:14.540]  on the economy.
[02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:16.060]  That's the whole post.
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:16.900]  That's it.
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:17.980]  And it's a link, and it's a link
[02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:19.340]  so you can go read more about it.
[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:22.580]  But why until now would it have been easy,
[02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:26.080]  she could have tweeted that, she might have tweeted that,
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:28.260]  but why is it easier?
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:30.900]  And one thing, as a user,
[02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:34.180]  as someone who is doing the tweeting,
[02:57:34.180 --> 02:57:35.820]  Twitter has a great experience.
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:40.820]  There's a box, and you type in it, and then you hit return.
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:43.740]  Or you click the publish button or post,
[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:45.980]  whatever the hell the action is, right?
[02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:46.820]  That's it.
[02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:48.420]  That's great.
[02:57:48.420 --> 02:57:50.860]  It is, because there is no friction,
[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:53.300]  and no friction interfaces will beat
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.780]  frictioned interfaces every time.
[02:57:56.700 --> 02:57:58.180]  Yeah, so we built that for us.
[02:57:58.180 --> 02:57:59.540]  We cut down our editor.
[02:57:59.540 --> 02:58:01.620]  It looks basically like Twitter.
[02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:02.700]  There's some publisher stuff.
[02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:03.920]  Like, we need some groups in there.
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:06.220]  We need to be able to add some bylines, like, sure.
[02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:08.140]  But that was our thought,
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:10.620]  was the reason we're using Twitter is,
[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:14.500]  one, the interface, a standard article publishing interface,
[02:58:14.500 --> 02:58:18.300]  you can see the company's org chart and KPIs in it.
[02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:20.300]  Yep, yep, yep.
[02:58:20.300 --> 02:58:22.300]  It's just, right, it's just there.
[02:58:22.300 --> 02:58:24.020]  It's the way it goes, and it's fine.
[02:58:24.020 --> 02:58:26.460]  It has made us very successful over 11 years.
[02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:28.620]  This was like, we're just gonna get rid of every field
[02:58:28.620 --> 02:58:30.740]  that doesn't need to be there,
[02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.220]  and make it nicer than Twitter.
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:34.380]  And if you're listening to this,
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:36.820]  you're probably aware that big publishers
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:39.540]  have these baroque social media policies,
[02:58:39.540 --> 02:58:41.460]  and they're tying themselves in knots
[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:43.780]  over reporters using Twitter, and being personal brands.
[02:58:43.780 --> 02:58:46.820]  And my instance, we've just given better software.
[02:58:46.820 --> 02:58:48.980]  Just make the tools more fun to use,
[02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:50.260]  and it's kind of working.
[02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:52.600]  Yeah, and I think that you don't even have
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:53.580]  to have the policy then,
[02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:56.380]  because if the tools are there, and the ease is there,
[02:58:56.380 --> 02:58:58.500]  and it's just, type this into a box
[02:58:58.500 --> 02:59:00.300]  with the URL that you're linking to,
[02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:03.700]  and your comment on it, and hit a button, and it goes out,
[02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:07.100]  the fact that they'll be doing it
[02:59:07.100 --> 02:59:10.500]  in a verge-appropriate way will be intuitive to them,
[02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:12.140]  because they know what they're doing, right?
[02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:14.860]  Like, the baroque policies are all about the nether,
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:18.500]  the gray areas of a political reporter
[02:59:18.500 --> 02:59:22.040]  tweeting an opinion about politics
[02:59:22.040 --> 02:59:24.700]  when their day job at the New York Times,
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:26.180]  or the Washington Post, or whatever,
[02:59:26.180 --> 02:59:29.860]  is being a straight reporter on politics.
[02:59:29.860 --> 02:59:33.340]  Whereas, if they knew the destination of the blurb
[02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:38.340]  and link was going to their publication, it's intuitive.
[02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:42.060]  You don't even, it's second nature, right?
[02:59:42.060 --> 02:59:42.900]  As opposed to when,
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:46.540]  well, I'm not saying nobody's going to make a mistake.
[02:59:46.540 --> 02:59:51.540]  I'm just saying, no, it'll keep them on board, you know?
[02:59:52.180 --> 02:59:54.020]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[02:59:54.020 --> 02:59:57.340]  Our staff is like, it was in particular,
[02:59:57.340 --> 03:00:00.380]  you called hers out, like, I think the thing
[03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:03.020]  that makes The Verge great is we don't hold ourselves
[03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:05.380]  to the standards of being national political reporters,
[03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:06.660]  or whatever.
[03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:08.420]  It's the most emotional tech publication
[03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:10.060]  that has ever existed in the history of the world.
[03:00:10.060 --> 03:00:13.220]  Like, we're proud of it, we wear our hearts on our sleeves.
[03:00:13.220 --> 03:00:15.260]  My features editor, Kevin Nguyen, is always telling me,
[03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:17.020]  it's a Verge toy because it's on The Verge, right?
[03:00:17.020 --> 03:00:19.440]  And our collective taste is what defines
[03:00:19.440 --> 03:00:22.420]  the brand of the publication, so we'll see.
[03:00:22.420 --> 03:00:25.380]  We did run it in staging, where some stuff we said,
[03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:30.340]  okay, this is going too far, don't post old meme jokes,
[03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:32.380]  we don't need to do this stuff.
[03:00:32.380 --> 03:00:33.420]  And there's some stuff that's better
[03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:34.440]  for people's personal Twitter,
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:37.400]  I'm not policing that by any source of imagination.
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:40.740]  But the part where you are a reporter or a journalist
[03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:42.820]  and you want to talk about the thing you cover,
[03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:45.700]  it's very natural for you to do that if the interface
[03:00:45.700 --> 03:00:48.540]  is as good as the one that Twitter offers you,
[03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:50.020]  to do it on your homepage.
[03:00:50.020 --> 03:00:52.540]  And I think that, and it's like fun.
[03:00:52.540 --> 03:00:57.540]  And like, I think most enterprise software is not fun.
[03:00:58.500 --> 03:01:00.900]  And so if we just make ours like a little bit more fun,
[03:01:00.900 --> 03:01:02.540]  it is vastly more fun than everyone else's
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:03.620]  enterprise software.
[03:01:03.620 --> 03:01:06.420]  Right, it's like taking a bicycle uphill
[03:01:06.420 --> 03:01:08.940]  versus taking a bicycle downhill.
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:12.260]  Taking a bicycle, riding a bicycle downhill is lots of fun.
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:15.260]  Riding a bicycle uphill is no fun at all.
[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:20.260]  And most CMS interfaces is to get this thing I wanna,
[03:01:20.260 --> 03:01:22.660]  whether it's a long article or a medium article
[03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:24.540]  or a link post, even a link post.
[03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:27.020]  If it feels like riding a bicycle uphill
[03:01:27.020 --> 03:01:30.100]  and over on your phone, there's Twitter,
[03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:34.980]  which is like riding a skateboard downhill, right?
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:37.980]  With all of the danger that that entails.
[03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:39.540]  Yes, exactly, fun.
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:44.780]  But you don't even have to pedal, you just hop on.
[03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:46.180]  Of course that's what you're going to do.
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:47.420]  It's human psychology.
[03:01:47.420 --> 03:01:49.460]  And it's even the sort of thing where maybe
[03:01:49.460 --> 03:01:51.820]  first thing in the morning, oh, I'll do the right thing.
[03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:55.820]  But by the end of the day, when your willpower is depleted
[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:57.300]  because you've gone through the day.
[03:01:57.300 --> 03:02:00.060]  And that's how willpower works.
[03:02:00.060 --> 03:02:01.940]  That's why people who work out in the morning
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:03.940]  tend to stick with it better than people
[03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:05.580]  who try to work out after work.
[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:08.020]  Because your willpower is with you in the morning.
[03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:08.840]  That's great.
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:11.860]  The flip side of the Twitter argument is the consumption.
[03:02:11.860 --> 03:02:16.300]  Right, and this is where I talk to you.
[03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:20.500]  I think we're seeing a moment where people out there
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:22.820]  are realizing, you know what,
[03:02:22.820 --> 03:02:25.000]  Twitter is a waste of my fucking time.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:26.380]  Yeah, I love Twitter.
[03:02:26.380 --> 03:02:28.100]  And it is where my community is.
[03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:29.340]  I check my mentions.
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:31.980]  But I more and more and more
[03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:33.940]  only look at two things in Twitter.
[03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:36.700]  I look at my DMs, which are open,
[03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:38.860]  and I look at my mentions.
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:42.580]  And I love to go back and forth with people in my mentions.
[03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:45.620]  It is the comment section of Daring Fireball,
[03:02:45.620 --> 03:02:46.660]  in effect, unofficially,
[03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.180]  and the only one that's ever been in public.
[03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:50.460]  And I love it for that.
[03:02:50.460 --> 03:02:52.920]  But I don't go to my main, I don't set up lists.
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:54.020]  I don't go to my lists.
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:56.580]  I don't go to the, I'm not saying I never do.
[03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:57.540]  I do sometimes.
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:59.660]  But every time I do, I regret it.
[03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:01.620]  And it's a waste of time.
[03:03:01.620 --> 03:03:06.220]  And going instead, what's going on with the Mac,
[03:03:06.220 --> 03:03:09.220]  going to MacRumors and just scrolling down
[03:03:09.220 --> 03:03:10.580]  to see what's going on.
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:13.060]  Just going to Tech Meme.
[03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:14.100]  Did anything break?
[03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:16.580]  Just take a look at the top four stories on Tech Meme.
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:17.420]  Nope.
[03:03:17.420 --> 03:03:19.860]  Go to The Verge, scroll down, scroll, scroll.
[03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:21.660]  Oh, there's a neat, oh, this is a neat story
[03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:25.340]  about this FedEx predicts recession thing, right?
[03:03:25.340 --> 03:03:30.340]  That, to me, is so much more peaceful, effective.
[03:03:32.820 --> 03:03:34.540]  It's not a time sink.
[03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:36.580]  It's not gonna make me angry.
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:39.740]  I'm never gonna go to theverge.com
[03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:43.260]  and scroll down and get angry,
[03:03:43.260 --> 03:03:46.300]  like I do if I go to my main Twitter timeline.
[03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:50.340]  And I think a lot of people are becoming aware of that.
[03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:52.780]  Yeah, I think we feel that in the moment.
[03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:56.620]  Since I've had this in the past six months,
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:03:58.700]  my Twitter usage has dropped.
[03:03:58.700 --> 03:04:00.500]  And I've been publishing to no one.
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:03.420]  I've been publishing to a staging server
[03:04:03.420 --> 03:04:05.700]  for 20 other people who have access.
[03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:08.580]  And I was like, oh, I love writing for these 20 people.
[03:04:08.580 --> 03:04:12.100]  And if I can just, The Verge is huge, right?
[03:04:12.100 --> 03:04:14.900]  It just is, it's a 100 person newsroom
[03:04:14.900 --> 03:04:16.540]  inside of a 2,000 person company
[03:04:16.540 --> 03:04:18.580]  that runs 18 editorial brands
[03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:20.340]  that has now this massive product team,
[03:04:20.340 --> 03:04:22.100]  which if it hasn't come through,
[03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:24.660]  that I love very much for building this product for us.
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:28.460]  This huge sales organization, whatever, it's big.
[03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:29.980]  There's a huge audience.
[03:04:29.980 --> 03:04:34.980]  If I can just make it feel small to an individual reader,
[03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:36.460]  we will be successful.
[03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:39.740]  That's the goal of this.
[03:04:39.740 --> 03:04:43.500]  And I think it harks back to the early days of Twitter
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:46.100]  when nobody would have called Twitter a cesspool.
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:48.100]  The only thing we complained about was the fail whale
[03:04:48.100 --> 03:04:50.380]  because they couldn't keep the thing running.
[03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:54.220]  Which again, I keep thinking not to go on a tangent
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:56.460]  because we're way out of time for tangents,
[03:04:56.460 --> 03:04:59.020]  but this whole thing with Mudge
[03:04:59.020 --> 03:05:01.140]  and the fact that according to him,
[03:05:01.140 --> 03:05:02.660]  Twitter's entire infrastructure
[03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:07.660]  is a goddamn duct tape Byzantine Rube Goldberg mess
[03:05:07.660 --> 03:05:11.580]  that nobody inside Twitter actually understands,
[03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:13.420]  to me makes complete sense
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:18.420]  because they never really fixed the fail whale problem.
[03:05:19.300 --> 03:05:22.100]  They just sort of, eventually it stopped happening
[03:05:22.100 --> 03:05:24.540]  and they're like, okay, don't touch anything.
[03:05:24.540 --> 03:05:26.300]  Yeah, and it just kept going.
[03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:27.780]  But they have all these,
[03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:28.780]  ever since they've been around,
[03:05:28.780 --> 03:05:30.180]  they have all these weird problems
[03:05:30.180 --> 03:05:33.860]  like all but your most 800 recent tweets
[03:05:33.860 --> 03:05:35.500]  are actually in cold storage
[03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:38.420]  and you couldn't delete.
[03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:42.540]  It all sounded like a mess, they never fixed it.
[03:05:42.540 --> 03:05:44.660]  But in those early days of Twitter,
[03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:47.060]  the actual timeline was like,
[03:05:47.060 --> 03:05:48.940]  it was nothing but gold, right?
[03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:51.940]  It was like, I follow like 70 people
[03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:53.500]  and they're all people I chose,
[03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:55.660]  our accounts I chose to follow.
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:05:58.620]  And it was gold, gold, gold, gold, right?
[03:05:58.620 --> 03:06:01.580]  It was just like, oh, funny links, funny jokes,
[03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:05.700]  observations from friends and it was nothing but joy.
[03:06:06.860 --> 03:06:10.300]  And didn't even have the infinite scroll,
[03:06:10.300 --> 03:06:14.300]  you could get to the bottom and it would stop
[03:06:14.300 --> 03:06:16.180]  and you'd be like, okay, I'll come back tomorrow,
[03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:17.460]  Twitter, thank you.
[03:06:17.460 --> 03:06:19.940]  And it's such, I know the analogy,
[03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:22.700]  the slow boiling pot of water with a frog in it
[03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:24.700]  is I use it all the time, everybody uses it,
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:26.580]  but it's so powerful.
[03:06:26.580 --> 03:06:31.580]  It speaks to the way we as humans get into problems.
[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:34.060]  Twitter going from nothing but gold
[03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:37.140]  and a fun place to scroll down
[03:06:37.140 --> 03:06:39.300]  until you hit the bottom of today's tweets
[03:06:39.300 --> 03:06:43.700]  to what it is today, which is, I don't even know what,
[03:06:43.700 --> 03:06:48.700]  it's like the money machine, you get into a phone booth
[03:06:49.700 --> 03:06:52.180]  and it's shooting dollar bills around
[03:06:52.180 --> 03:06:53.940]  and you're supposed to try to grab them.
[03:06:53.940 --> 03:06:56.580]  It's like that except instead of dollar bills,
[03:06:56.580 --> 03:06:58.060]  it's like a couple of dollar bills
[03:06:58.060 --> 03:07:00.740]  and mostly thumbtacks, right?
[03:07:00.740 --> 03:07:02.820]  Shooting around in a phone booth
[03:07:02.820 --> 03:07:04.980]  and you're trying to keep them from going into your eye.
[03:07:04.980 --> 03:07:08.900]  It wasn't like somebody made this one decision
[03:07:08.900 --> 03:07:10.780]  and Twitter went from that to this.
[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:13.540]  It was a slow boiling frog.
[03:07:13.540 --> 03:07:15.460]  But here we are and I think people are like,
[03:07:15.460 --> 03:07:17.180]  you know what, I'm getting out of the pot
[03:07:17.180 --> 03:07:19.300]  and I'd like to go back somewhere nice
[03:07:19.300 --> 03:07:21.460]  where every single thing as I scroll down,
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:23.260]  maybe I'm not interested in this post.
[03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:26.620]  I'll just keep, I'll just move my eyes down three inches
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:29.380]  to the next one and then I'll hit the space bar
[03:07:29.380 --> 03:07:34.140]  or swipe on my phone until I, oh, and I saw that post
[03:07:34.140 --> 03:07:35.140]  so I know I'm done.
[03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:37.260]  I've caught up on what's on theverge.com
[03:07:37.260 --> 03:07:38.100]  or on DaringFirewall.
[03:07:38.100 --> 03:07:40.500]  This is the thing I really wanna add
[03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:42.340]  is the indicator that says you're done.
[03:07:42.340 --> 03:07:43.180]  Yeah.
[03:07:43.180 --> 03:07:48.180]  So we have grand plans to make this thing alive.
[03:07:48.380 --> 03:07:51.500]  We just had to ship a thing first.
[03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:53.700]  Building the logic to make it update live
[03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:55.660]  and to like remember state and all that stuff
[03:07:55.660 --> 03:07:59.460]  is like why are we holding ourselves up?
[03:07:59.460 --> 03:08:01.340]  We should ship it and make sure
[03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.460]  that it's doing the things we want.
[03:08:03.460 --> 03:08:05.860]  Like the fail state for this is our staff hates it,
[03:08:05.860 --> 03:08:09.020]  we stopped doing it and it kinda looks like the old Verge.
[03:08:09.020 --> 03:08:10.500]  Right, it's just a list of stories.
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:12.540]  What do you think, is that even on the table?
[03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:14.900]  I mean, do you have feedback from the staff yet?
[03:08:14.900 --> 03:08:16.300]  Oh, we love it.
[03:08:16.300 --> 03:08:18.020]  Well then why are you even saying?
[03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:20.380]  Well, I'm just saying like we needed to ship a thing
[03:08:20.380 --> 03:08:23.620]  where like the fail state didn't imply
[03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:26.140]  that we were gonna spend a bunch of time building live logic.
[03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:27.340]  Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:29.740]  But now it's like here it's been three days, who knows.
[03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:30.860]  Maybe it'll still be a disaster.
[03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:32.100]  But we think it's gonna be fun.
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:34.680]  But we have grand plans to build this thing
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:36.860]  into being kind of alive.
[03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:39.580]  And so that thing you're talking about where you're done
[03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:42.060]  I think is very powerful.
[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:45.140]  And then once we know you're done or you're done,
[03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:47.980]  saying there's something new is also very powerful.
[03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:51.340]  So we've just got these like moves yet to build
[03:08:51.340 --> 03:08:52.860]  that I think are...
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:56.540]  I'm just excited to have people care about a webpage.
[03:08:56.540 --> 03:09:00.580]  And I already have a text from half a dozen media people
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:03.260]  that are like, you're obviously making an app, right?
[03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:04.300]  And it's like, yeah, maybe.
[03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:06.740]  Like I've just described our headless CMS certified API.
[03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:09.700]  Like I saw the PM of our API, his name is Phil.
[03:09:09.700 --> 03:09:11.820]  He runs this API called Tower inside of Ox Media now.
[03:09:11.820 --> 03:09:14.300]  And we had our little launch happy hour at the bar.
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:15.140]  And he was like, how's it going?
[03:09:15.140 --> 03:09:17.220]  And I was like, I have 900 ideas for your API.
[03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:18.260]  He was like, oh God.
[03:09:19.740 --> 03:09:21.380]  So like, we'll get there.
[03:09:21.380 --> 03:09:23.580]  But we had to ship the first thing first.
[03:09:23.580 --> 03:09:25.060]  Yeah, and you guys could...
[03:09:25.060 --> 03:09:26.980]  I'm not even gonna try to talk you out of an app
[03:09:26.980 --> 03:09:30.220]  because you guys have enough staff.
[03:09:30.220 --> 03:09:31.340]  And like you said, I don't know,
[03:09:31.340 --> 03:09:34.060]  I'm actually surprised that it's 50 articles a day.
[03:09:34.060 --> 03:09:35.460]  I was thinking more of like the type
[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:36.900]  that would get anchored at the top,
[03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:40.100]  but I'm a little surprised, not surprised.
[03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:41.180]  You've got enough content
[03:09:41.180 --> 03:09:43.940]  that you could justify an actual app that is your own.
[03:09:43.940 --> 03:09:47.140]  But I used to get all the time,
[03:09:47.140 --> 03:09:49.860]  no, it's one of those things like 20 years ago,
[03:09:49.860 --> 03:09:50.860]  over and over and over again,
[03:09:50.860 --> 03:09:52.540]  why doesn't Daring Fireball have comments?
[03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:53.500]  Why don't you have comments?
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:54.600]  Everybody else has comments.
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:55.860]  You use movable type, right?
[03:09:55.860 --> 03:09:57.000]  That has comments.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:57.920]  Why don't you have comments?
[03:09:57.920 --> 03:09:58.820]  Why don't you have comments?
[03:09:58.820 --> 03:10:01.700]  It's not really a blog if you don't have comments.
[03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:04.060]  And I would say, okay, then it's not a blog,
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:05.540]  but it looks like a blog to me.
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:06.980]  I just, but there was some...
[03:10:06.980 --> 03:10:08.060]  Extremely boring.
[03:10:08.060 --> 03:10:09.440]  Is it a blog?
[03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:12.220]  It's one of those decisions where time has proven me right.
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:14.560]  And at some point people stopped asking me,
[03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:17.140]  why don't you have comments because they got it.
[03:10:20.420 --> 03:10:24.540]  People used to ask me in the go-go years of the app store,
[03:10:24.540 --> 03:10:27.180]  oh my God, all you do is write about Apple.
[03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:29.280]  You're the go-to place for me to go to,
[03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:31.740]  to find out about apps for the iPhone.
[03:10:31.740 --> 03:10:34.060]  You gotta have a Daring Fireball app.
[03:10:34.060 --> 03:10:34.940]  You gotta have a Daring...
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:36.980]  Why don't you, you're working on it, right?
[03:10:36.980 --> 03:10:39.220]  And I'd be like, no, I don't want an app.
[03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:41.260]  I've already, you said, you just told me,
[03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:43.500]  you come to my website to read about this stuff.
[03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:44.780]  I'm done, I've got it.
[03:10:44.780 --> 03:10:46.900]  This is all, this is meant to be a website
[03:10:46.900 --> 03:10:49.820]  and you can read it on your phone, it's fine.
[03:10:49.820 --> 03:10:51.860]  You don't need, it doesn't need to be an app.
[03:10:52.860 --> 03:10:55.420]  I never understood, and guess what?
[03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:56.700]  People don't ask me that anymore.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:58.600]  Yeah, I mean, I've,
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:00.140]  I'm not wearing a shipping app tomorrow.
[03:11:00.140 --> 03:11:01.420]  I think I have...
[03:11:01.420 --> 03:11:03.740]  I could not, there's no justification
[03:11:03.740 --> 03:11:04.820]  for Daring Fireball to happen.
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:05.860]  I don't write enough.
[03:11:05.860 --> 03:11:08.380]  Even on the days when I'm the most productive
[03:11:08.380 --> 03:11:10.020]  with the most link posts,
[03:11:10.020 --> 03:11:12.260]  it doesn't make sense for me to have an app, never did.
[03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:14.980]  You, Diverge could definitely justify it.
[03:11:14.980 --> 03:11:16.340]  I think, especially now that we have a feed
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:18.420]  that updates all the time and points you around the web,
[03:11:18.420 --> 03:11:23.420]  which is like, the main thing is the apps
[03:11:23.820 --> 03:11:24.820]  are generally better.
[03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:26.220]  This is like total Ben Thompson stuff,
[03:11:26.220 --> 03:11:27.060]  but like they're generally better
[03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:28.020]  when they're aggregators, right?
[03:11:28.020 --> 03:11:30.060]  So like we have a little bit of that move to play,
[03:11:30.060 --> 03:11:34.660]  but I don't think we can get to an app until,
[03:11:34.660 --> 03:11:36.440]  I don't know, I'll call it a year.
[03:11:36.440 --> 03:11:40.420]  Like we've got to build this product out and finish it
[03:11:40.420 --> 03:11:42.500]  before we try to pipe it into something else.
[03:11:42.500 --> 03:11:43.340]  Yeah, but I'm with you.
[03:11:43.340 --> 03:11:44.180]  It's great.
[03:11:44.180 --> 03:11:46.600]  It's fantastic that people are talking about a website.
[03:11:46.600 --> 03:11:50.260]  Yeah, it's hard for me to be like,
[03:11:50.260 --> 03:11:53.500]  too sensitive to criticism,
[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:54.460]  even like we are.
[03:11:54.460 --> 03:11:56.540]  I'm trying to calibrate that very carefully.
[03:11:56.540 --> 03:11:57.620]  We're taking it all in.
[03:11:57.620 --> 03:11:58.820]  We're reading it all.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:00.860]  A lot of it maps to our internal criticism,
[03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:02.540]  as you would expect, right?
[03:12:02.540 --> 03:12:03.860]  We've been looking at it for months.
[03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:05.020]  So that's great.
[03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:05.860]  I think we're gonna take it.
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:06.860]  A lot of it's surprising.
[03:12:06.860 --> 03:12:09.740]  We're gonna sort that out and prioritize and do it.
[03:12:09.740 --> 03:12:12.340]  But none of it's making me feel bad,
[03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:15.120]  because I'm like, we're talking about a website
[03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:18.760]  on the open web that is worth talking about.
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:21.580]  So I hope we can just hold on to that moment
[03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:24.980]  as a community for one second and just be like, okay.
[03:12:24.980 --> 03:12:26.740]  It's not dead yet.
[03:12:26.740 --> 03:12:29.260]  We haven't given the web over to Google AMP yet.
[03:12:30.420 --> 03:12:32.820]  Let's just take a minute and pay attention to it.
[03:12:32.820 --> 03:12:34.340]  Yeah.
[03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:35.980]  With that, let's wrap it up.
[03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:38.540]  I think three and a half hours is long enough.
[03:12:38.540 --> 03:12:40.100]  We pulled like a brogue in here, dude.
[03:12:40.100 --> 03:12:41.100]  You went for it.
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:43.380]  I did not expect that, but...
[03:12:43.380 --> 03:12:44.700]  You, at the start, you're like,
[03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.500]  we can't go for two hours, and here we are.
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:48.180]  Well, we did have lots to talk about.
[03:12:48.180 --> 03:12:51.620]  And you're the bastard who launched a great new web design.
[03:12:51.620 --> 03:12:54.540]  So we had more, more to talk about.
[03:12:54.540 --> 03:12:58.340]  Anyway, Eli, I do look forward to this every year.
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:01.040]  And honestly, it was, your tweet,
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:03.040]  I was running out of gas late last night,
[03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:05.420]  and it started creeping into my head.
[03:13:05.420 --> 03:13:07.580]  Maybe I'll just wake up and publish in the morning.
[03:13:07.580 --> 03:13:10.060]  What's the difference if I go after midnight
[03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:12.000]  or early in the morning?
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:13.500]  But you're the one, you did.
[03:13:13.500 --> 03:13:14.700]  You were like, and I'm like,
[03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:16.620]  ah, and then I could get Eli on the show,
[03:13:16.620 --> 03:13:18.820]  but I've gotta finish tonight.
[03:13:18.820 --> 03:13:23.660]  So anybody who read my review, actually on Friday,
[03:13:23.660 --> 03:13:25.320]  you could probably thank Eli Patel
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:27.260]  for getting it out, getting it out.
[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:28.400]  The internet's editor.
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:30.420]  No, man, this is part of the tradition for now.
[03:13:30.420 --> 03:13:31.740]  Review the iPhone.
[03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:33.660]  I feel like I have to decompress about it with you.
[03:13:33.660 --> 03:13:35.540]  Well, if there's not a link on the verge
[03:13:35.540 --> 03:13:37.020]  to this episode of the talk show,
[03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:39.020]  God damn it, you're gonna hear from the lawyer.
[03:13:39.020 --> 03:13:40.580]  Oh, you got it.
[03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:41.420]  It's done.
[03:13:41.420 --> 03:13:43.020]  As soon as it's published, you let me know.
[03:13:43.020 --> 03:13:44.540]  I'll get that post done in one second.
[03:13:44.540 --> 03:13:46.140]  Yeah, and my lawyer, you really,
[03:13:46.140 --> 03:13:47.580]  you do not wanna mess with her.
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:49.460]  I'm excited.
[03:13:49.460 --> 03:13:50.840]  Let me thank our sponsors.
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:52.500]  We had the Backblaze.
[03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:54.780]  We had the Trade Coffee.
[03:13:54.780 --> 03:13:58.540]  We had HelloPillow, and we had Squarespace,
[03:13:58.540 --> 03:13:59.860]  and of course, Eli Patel.
[03:13:59.860 --> 03:14:02.460]  I'm not even, I usually shout out to people's Twitters.
[03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:04.100]  I'm not even gonna put your Twitter handle on there.
[03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:05.100]  To hell with Twitter.
[03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:07.700]  Go to theverge.com.
[03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:09.100]  Yeah, it's a good website.
[03:14:09.100 --> 03:14:10.100]  Come to it a couple times a day.
[03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:35.100]  We're very happy.
