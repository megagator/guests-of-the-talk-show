[00:00.000 --> 00:10.720]  A couple weeks ago, a long time sponsor of the show, Casper, you know, the people who sell
[00:10.720 --> 00:16.600]  mattresses, they had a spot and when I read their URL, I said that their domain name
[00:16.600 --> 00:23.440]  was CasperSleep.com, which is what it used to be and which in fact still does redirect,
[00:23.440 --> 00:26.960]  but their new URL is Casper.com.
[00:26.960 --> 00:30.560]  When I did that, they sent like a nice little note and it was very friendly and it was like,
[00:30.560 --> 00:36.440]  hey, you know, that used to be our URL, but we sprung for just playing Casper.com and the
[00:36.440 --> 00:40.960]  next time we have a spot run, you know, please use that one instead.
[00:40.960 --> 00:48.600]  And last week, they had another spot in the show and like a dummy, I once again said on
[00:48.600 --> 00:55.960]  the air, go to CasperSleep.com slash talk show and they sent me a very nice email.
[00:55.960 --> 00:59.640]  That was so nice that I thought I should right here at the front of the show, just put a little
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.960]  insert here and just tell you, if you're in a market for a mattress and you want to go there,
[01:04.960 --> 01:15.760]  go to Casper.com, C-A-S-P-E-R slash talk show, Casper.com slash talk show.
[01:15.760 --> 01:27.440]  I thanks to them for their patience with me and now on with the show.
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.440]  Joanna, how are you?
[01:28.440 --> 01:30.320]  It's been a while, I think.
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.720]  It has been a while, but you hear no sirens and no dog, unlike my last appearance on
[01:36.720 --> 01:37.720]  this show.
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.120]  Is that the last appearance?
[01:39.120 --> 01:40.120]  I think so.
[01:40.120 --> 01:50.400]  Yes, it was definitely the sirens, very, very angry, angry listeners about the sirens.
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.320]  It has been a very Joanna Stern year in technology, don't you think?
[01:56.320 --> 01:58.400]  Yeah, just me all the time.
[01:58.400 --> 02:06.480]  They released me like 10 times, well, but what I mean by that is that to me, you are one
[02:06.480 --> 02:22.280]  of the most obsessed in our racket with laptop keyboards and tablets and where are portable
[02:22.280 --> 02:27.200]  computers going and it's been what a crazy year, right?
[02:27.200 --> 02:31.800]  Insane and actually just had a conversation with my editor about my column next week.
[02:31.800 --> 02:35.320]  I think I've actually ditched the entire idea because it's too hard.
[02:35.320 --> 02:39.760]  I hate to say that I'm ditching something because it's too hard, but trying to tell someone
[02:39.760 --> 02:47.320]  what to buy right now is too hard.
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.160]  Maybe that's the angle to take though is to talk about how you can't really say, here's
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.920]  what you should buy because it's too hard.
[02:53.920 --> 02:55.560]  It really is too hard.
[02:55.560 --> 02:59.120]  Well, I don't know, I should probably not talk about what my idea was, is someone listening
[02:59.120 --> 03:05.160]  will just do it better than me, but my idea was I wanted to make a forum or a chart
[03:05.160 --> 03:10.480]  where it's like, you just go in, you tell, tell it, this is what I want, this is what
[03:10.480 --> 03:14.320]  I want the computer to do, this is how I use my computer, this is the operating system
[03:14.320 --> 03:21.600]  I want, and then it tells you what to get, but making that's really, really hard.
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.600]  The matrix has gotten very complicated, so you could have been on it and we've been trying
[03:26.600 --> 03:29.240]  to work out a time, it works for you to be on the show.
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.360]  At any point, like the last two or three months, to talk about the iPad Pro or to talk
[03:34.360 --> 03:41.760]  about the Surface book and the Surface Pro 4 and all the keyboards and et cetera, but now
[03:41.760 --> 03:44.080]  we can just talk about them all at once.
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.360]  And yeah, and there was an iPhone before that, and then what have I been doing with myself?
[03:49.360 --> 03:55.360]  There's been a lot of reviews, a lot of products, good products, some not so good, but really
[03:55.360 --> 03:56.360]  interesting.
[03:56.360 --> 04:03.400]  I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw a thing, and I didn't see the breakdown, maybe you did, but
[04:03.400 --> 04:10.560]  I saw a thing where, every year, with the Black Friday and the whole opening of the holiday
[04:10.560 --> 04:20.760]  shopping season, that 64% of the online purchases over the weekend were done on a mobile
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.760]  device.
[04:21.760 --> 04:24.120]  Yeah, so that's kind of astounding.
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.240]  The thing I don't know is what are they calling a mobile device?
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.360]  Does that include tablets or is it, is it, don't they usually break down by
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.040]  operating system, like how they get out of it?
[04:37.040 --> 04:41.240]  But isn't that, like, I've been thinking about this for years, but I feel like part of
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.680]  what makes this year, what 2015 so interesting, is that doing it by operating system
[04:46.680 --> 04:49.040]  really doesn't make sense anymore.
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.520]  True, very true.
[04:50.520 --> 04:56.240]  I mean, windows, like, someone could be on their windows phone and they're actually on,
[04:56.240 --> 05:01.600]  or they, it says windows 10 and they could be on like a 50 foot desktop.
[05:01.600 --> 05:02.600]  Right.
[05:02.600 --> 05:04.920]  And conversely, right.
[05:04.920 --> 05:14.800]  And conversely, the, on the Apple side, the iPad Pro is going to qualify by OS as a mobile
[05:14.800 --> 05:20.920]  device, but it's, and by some definition, it is certainly mobile where you're certainly
[05:20.920 --> 05:25.800]  using it, you know, without any, you know, connected to a power or anything like that,
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.240]  you don't have to be.
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.880]  But it's meant to be used on a desk of some sort, or at least on your lap, like it's
[05:33.880 --> 05:35.600]  not like a handheld device.
[05:35.600 --> 05:36.600]  Right.
[05:36.600 --> 05:37.600]  Right.
[05:37.600 --> 05:40.560]  I've been using mine more and more in bed.
[05:40.560 --> 05:49.520]  I like, um, we've pretty much watched all of Jane, Jane the Virgin on the iPad Pro.
[05:49.520 --> 05:52.920]  It's really, really interesting as a TV.
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.920]  Yeah.
[05:53.920 --> 05:58.440]  Like, and the last two trips that I've taken, I've just, I took my air.
[05:58.440 --> 05:59.440]  I have this problem.
[05:59.440 --> 06:00.440]  I just have to take the air.
[06:00.440 --> 06:01.440]  It makes me feel better.
[06:01.440 --> 06:06.680]  Um, but I pretty much only used the pro, which, you know, I, that's the difference between
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.800]  when you like review something for a week and then you really start using it.
[06:09.800 --> 06:15.760]  Um, I just, as a travel device, it's, it's really good.
[06:15.760 --> 06:20.160]  You know, because you, as much as like it's kind of crazy that you're just like kind of,
[06:20.160 --> 06:24.840]  it is the top of the laptop screen, like just taking that off and having the screen without
[06:24.840 --> 06:27.640]  the keyboard to watch Netflix is, is huge.
[06:27.640 --> 06:28.640]  Yeah.
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.920]  And the screen is like 90 times better than my, my air.
[06:33.920 --> 06:34.920]  So all right.
[06:34.920 --> 06:35.920]  Let's keep going with it.
[06:35.920 --> 06:39.720]  Let's keep going with talking about the iPad Pro and we'll get to the other devices in
[06:39.720 --> 06:40.720]  due time.
[06:40.720 --> 06:48.640]  Um, I have found and it's one of the little things that it really makes a huge difference
[06:48.640 --> 06:54.120]  between the, and I know you mentioned this in your iPad Pro review for the, for the journal.
[06:54.120 --> 07:01.520]  Um, if you just look at the numbers, 9.7 inch for the standard iPad size to 12 point, whatever
[07:01.520 --> 07:05.880]  inches this one is, it doesn't sound like a lot for some reason in my brain.
[07:05.880 --> 07:08.640]  But in practice, it's a tremendous difference.
[07:08.640 --> 07:10.440]  Yeah, it's giant.
[07:10.440 --> 07:14.640]  And one of the things, and I don't think I, it's like you just said, it's sometimes
[07:14.640 --> 07:19.000]  it's so hard in one week, the one week you get between when you get a review unit and
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.040]  when the reviews come out, it's hard to cover all the basis.
[07:22.040 --> 07:28.400]  Um, and I've heard this from a lot of people who, you know, readers of Darren Fireball that
[07:28.400 --> 07:34.640]  it's a huge, huge deal for anybody who deals with actual documents like, I know lawyers,
[07:34.640 --> 07:38.760]  for example, everything they do is like eight and a half by eleven pieces of paper.
[07:38.760 --> 07:44.760]  And, um, I've also heard from some people in education that for teachers, it's a huge
[07:44.760 --> 07:45.760]  deal.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.400]  If, if you have like students submitting work in any kind of word processing document
[07:50.400 --> 07:55.320]  where it's a page, now they can, you know, they can read them right there on the iPad.
[07:55.320 --> 07:56.320]  And it's not tiny.
[07:56.320 --> 07:58.360]  It's like the sides it's supposed to be.
[07:58.360 --> 08:03.480]  And what I've done, I, I haven't been in a comic books in years, but, um, I started reading
[08:03.480 --> 08:05.760]  comic, comic books on it.
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.880]  And it's all the difference in the world, like what I can take one of the reasons I never
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.520]  really got into reading comic books on iPads before is, it was just too small.
[08:14.520 --> 08:18.480]  And now, I saw it Andy and Apko even tweeted a picture of it.
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.640]  It's just like side by side with like an actual comic book, it's, it's like the actual
[08:22.640 --> 08:23.640]  size.
[08:23.640 --> 08:26.920]  It's absolutely standard size for a comic book.
[08:26.920 --> 08:32.560]  But it, and TV, I think is a similar type thing where it, it, like, laying in bed or
[08:32.560 --> 08:37.480]  sitting on a chair somewhere and just having it right in front of you, it's, it, it feels,
[08:37.480 --> 08:41.480]  it fills your field of vision in a way that the iPad didn't before.
[08:41.480 --> 08:42.480]  Yeah.
[08:42.480 --> 08:47.160]  And definitely for like sharing, you know, sharing of viewing experience, it's great.
[08:47.160 --> 08:51.400]  You know, that's where I did feel like the iPad would be small was like if you're watching
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.440]  a video with, with somebody, um, you know, especially on an airplane when you're like, you're
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.560]  both trying to watch the iPad and you've got the middle seat bar between you and, you
[09:00.560 --> 09:07.280]  know, it's, it's, it's, it's just been great for watching, um, yeah, Netflix together.
[09:07.280 --> 09:13.160]  So that should be their next ad to just be like a shot of two people watching Netflix
[09:13.160 --> 09:18.160]  on the iPad and like really close together.
[09:18.160 --> 09:21.160]  Maybe they're not going to hire me for marketing.
[09:21.160 --> 09:23.480]  But it seems like a perfect ad.
[09:23.480 --> 09:24.480]  It does.
[09:24.480 --> 09:26.320]  Didn't they have one like that with the music?
[09:26.320 --> 09:33.280]  I seem to recall that there was an Apple ad that involved, um, some sort of romantic moment
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.640]  where it was, I don't know, like teenagers, but they were sharing their headphones, you
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.640]  know, their earbuds.
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.640]  Yeah.
[09:40.640 --> 09:43.960]  And the tagline is Netflix and chill.
[09:43.960 --> 09:47.000]  Well, I don't think Apple's going to put Netflix and chill in there.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.680]  I think that's what Apple's going to do.
[09:48.680 --> 09:50.920]  Just put it right across the center of the ad.
[09:50.920 --> 09:57.240]  Although I guess they, they sort of have a, a non contentious relationship with Netflix.
[09:57.240 --> 09:59.520]  So yeah, who knows?
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.360]  It's only semi competitive.
[10:01.360 --> 10:04.000]  It's such a good ad.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.800]  And not, but maybe it's also better ad for the smaller iPad's, you know, because if that's
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.520]  what you're really after, you know, you're, you're watching a movie and you're trying
[10:10.520 --> 10:15.720]  to get closer, you probably want the smaller iPad so you can get closer together.
[10:15.720 --> 10:16.720]  Hmm.
[10:16.720 --> 10:20.760]  I've gone too far with this.
[10:20.760 --> 10:27.200]  Uh, so you still, but you still take your MacBook Air everywhere you go.
[10:27.200 --> 10:28.200]  Yeah.
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.200]  Yeah.
[10:29.200 --> 10:32.720]  It's, I mean, God, my air is really a piece of shit now too.
[10:32.720 --> 10:37.520]  Um, I'm like looking at it and there's crumbs stuck in the, between the bezel, like
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.960]  on the right underneath the, the O and the MacBook, the first, oh, not the second, there's
[10:42.960 --> 10:45.600]  just like, I think it's a piece of bread.
[10:45.600 --> 10:46.600]  Yeah.
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.120]  It's really, it's, I went to pop belly for lunch.
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.600]  So it's probably, it's probably whole wheat bread.
[10:53.600 --> 10:59.280]  Anyway, yes, I take it, I take it because I don't know why I take it.
[10:59.280 --> 11:03.640]  I mean, there's certain apps that I, they really are not even some certain apps.
[11:03.640 --> 11:06.040]  Photoshop I use during the day.
[11:06.040 --> 11:10.400]  Um, sometimes I do some video editing and stuff like that.
[11:10.400 --> 11:12.920]  I think it's mostly comes down to the multitasking.
[11:12.920 --> 11:18.280]  I think, you know, a reader asked me today on, on Twitter, he was trying to decide between
[11:18.280 --> 11:20.560]  the iPad Pro and the MacBook Air.
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.200]  And I, I really think it just comes down to two things.
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.680]  It's not power.
[11:25.680 --> 11:28.120]  I mean, it's, it's certainly not power.
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.120]  Um, it's not screen because the pro kills it on screen and all these other things.
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.080]  I think it comes down to peripherals and multitasking.
[11:38.080 --> 11:39.080]  What do you think?
[11:39.080 --> 11:41.680]  Is there something I'm missing?
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.600]  Yeah, I'm no, I, I, I, I think that covers it.
[11:46.600 --> 11:50.560]  Well, and then the other, the other, the only other thing I can think of that's a big
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.000]  ticket, like this might be the primary reason that you decide would be, are there apps
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.160]  that only exist on one or the other?
[12:00.160 --> 12:01.160]  Right.
[12:01.160 --> 12:07.480]  Um, you know, and there are some that are many, in fact, that exist on both.
[12:07.480 --> 12:11.120]  You know, there's all sorts of writing apps, for example, that have, you know, clients
[12:11.120 --> 12:14.720]  that, you know, for both both platforms.
[12:14.720 --> 12:16.600]  So you don't have to decide.
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.880]  There are other things that are either Mac only or now there's a lot of apps that are
[12:21.880 --> 12:22.880]  iPad only.
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.880]  So, right.
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.560]  If you're, if you feel like you need one of those other than your decisions made for
[12:27.560 --> 12:28.560]  you.
[12:28.560 --> 12:29.560]  Yeah.
[12:29.560 --> 12:31.480]  The file system is another really big one.
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.600]  I guess that would be the third big thing, you know, and I kind of consider that under
[12:34.600 --> 12:36.520]  multitasking, which is not part of it.
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.720]  But, you know, I just deal with lots of different files and here, like people send word
[12:41.720 --> 12:45.360]  documents, unfortunately, and they're marked up and you got to download them and you
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.160]  got to look at them and then you got to reattach them and, you know, that's still a place
[12:49.160 --> 12:53.920]  where the iPad is just not, um, you know, in trying to make it simpler or sometimes it's
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.920]  just really hard.
[12:54.920 --> 12:58.680]  You know, I, I actually wrote about in the review, or I don't know if the whole thing came
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.680]  in, but, um, like I was just trying to get a PDF from one app to another and just can't
[13:05.680 --> 13:06.840]  really do it, right?
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.120]  There's no central file to put something in.
[13:10.120 --> 13:15.680]  You can put it in iCloud, iCloud, iCloud drive, but yeah, I just don't like to go there.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.680]  Yeah.
[13:16.680 --> 13:17.880]  And not every app supports it.
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.760]  It depends where you, you know, it's the same with Dropbox where there are definitely
[13:21.760 --> 13:28.480]  some apps that you can, you know, use app A for this and send a thing from app B by putting
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.560]  it in your Dropbox and both apps have Dropbox integration, but you really, you can't count
[13:33.560 --> 13:34.960]  on it across all apps.
[13:34.960 --> 13:35.960]  Right.
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.560]  And you have to, like, hope that the share system works well in that app to then bring
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.360]  it to the other app, um, and they were Adobe apps that I was using.
[13:45.360 --> 13:46.360]  Yeah.
[13:46.360 --> 13:51.360]  And as on the Mac, you would be shocked.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.360]  I would be.
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.840]  And in fact, it would, it would instantly make me any app that I use on a regular basis
[13:56.840 --> 13:58.840]  when I'm about to say would work.
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.280]  And if I was trying a new app and this didn't work, it would almost certainly make
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.120]  me think this app is a piece of junk and I'm just going to, I'm not even going to spend
[14:07.120 --> 14:13.840]  any more time in it, which is if I'm in a context where I want to add a JPEG, doesn't
[14:13.840 --> 14:17.800]  matter, is it an email attachment? I just want to send it to you. I'm using a chat app.
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.920]  I want to send you this picture. I want to add it to a document where I know the document
[14:21.920 --> 14:26.880]  can, you can add images to the document. I would just take it from the finder where I see
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.600]  the doc, you know, the image and drag it over and drop it in and it works everywhere.
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.880]  And it's worked like that since, you know, I don't know, 1984 where you just drag stuff
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.840]  where you want it to go. And it's crazy, it's still crazy to me. And it's one of those
[14:42.840 --> 14:48.960]  things where I feel like I'm speaking second language when I'm trying to work in iOS,
[14:48.960 --> 14:51.960]  which is that drag and drop isn't really even a thing there.
[14:51.960 --> 14:58.280]  Right. Yeah. No, I mean like on Tuesdays, which is like my big file column video day,
[14:58.280 --> 15:03.200]  my entire desktop is a mess. And it's like my worst nightmare when I go to someone's
[15:03.200 --> 15:08.000]  computer and see like just billions of files all over their desktop. But, and then I always
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.640]  clean it up, I like always clean it up Tuesday night. But like the reason that is just
[15:13.640 --> 15:16.680]  like it's the ease, you know, I put something there and then I drag it to Dropbox and
[15:16.680 --> 15:22.720]  I send it to my video editor, I pull down one file, I edit it from, you know, a print editor
[15:22.720 --> 15:28.280]  or then send it right back, you know, attach it, put it into Gmail, drag it into Gmail.
[15:28.280 --> 15:34.640]  Yeah, I mean, I think it's things like that. Those like sort of like, and I hate to say
[15:34.640 --> 15:40.040]  because I think those are the things that like make me old. Like I worry that these are
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.600]  the things that like I'm going to be that old person that's like, well, wait, this is
[15:43.600 --> 15:49.120]  why I can't recommend this because it doesn't have a USB port, you know, or something
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.640]  like that where I feel like, you know, I feel old when I say these things, but you get
[15:53.640 --> 16:00.560]  in these routines of how you work. I feel the exact same way where I don't want to
[16:00.560 --> 16:06.720]  be curmudgeonly that way. And I see it from the feedback I get from readers where some
[16:06.720 --> 16:13.320]  of them are, I don't want to say angry, but they seem to be frustrated with the whole,
[16:13.320 --> 16:17.840]  hey, maybe you can, you know, for some people you might be able to really just work on
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.480]  an iPad pro and they reject it and they're like, and they say, how can, you know, how
[16:22.480 --> 16:28.800]  can you work if you can't do X, Y, Z? And I can, I see what I see them doing is they're
[16:28.800 --> 16:33.160]  projecting, I can't work with X, Y, Z. And I actually believe them. I believe them that
[16:33.160 --> 16:37.720]  they, you know, that this is important. And there are definitely some tasks where you
[16:37.720 --> 16:42.200]  really want to be able to access, you know, have something like the finder where you can
[16:42.200 --> 16:49.640]  have just an arbitrary list of files of any type, just drag them. But there are, you're
[16:49.640 --> 16:53.360]  crazy if you don't think that there's a lot of people who don't need that whose workflow
[16:53.360 --> 16:58.760]  doesn't involve files and file system at all. And I think that's where I see like there
[16:58.760 --> 17:05.680]  are some days where I don't, I don't need that. And, you know, that's what a majority
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.360]  of users are, I can't say percentages, but many people like you said don't need some
[17:11.360 --> 17:16.800]  of these things. And that's where I think, you know, I think I go back a little bit into
[17:16.800 --> 17:23.800]  what I wrote in my pro review. It certainly feels right now it's a niche product. Maybe
[17:23.800 --> 17:31.120]  it isn't. Maybe it really does have more appeal at this point than I think, I don't
[17:31.120 --> 17:36.000]  know, I didn't even get specific on it, but maybe it has much more appeal than I thought
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.600]  right now, because more and more people ask me about it. And when I'm sort of trying to
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.640]  guide them between getting a laptop and the pro ends up saying, yeah, the pro is actually
[17:44.640 --> 17:48.720]  going to be perfectly great for what you need. And oh, you don't have an iPad or you haven't
[17:48.720 --> 17:56.880]  updated your iPad in years. Yeah, go for it. Yeah. So I don't, I think it's, I'm just
[17:56.880 --> 18:03.800]  really interested in what Apple is going to be able to do with the software to make it,
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.880]  to make it closer to what some people want as a laptop experience.
[18:07.880 --> 18:13.240]  Yeah, I think you, and I highlighted that sentence. I don't have it in front of me right
[18:13.240 --> 18:17.520]  now, but in your review, but more or less, and you know, it's not a unique observation,
[18:17.520 --> 18:20.880]  but I thought you said it very well, which is, but something more or less along the lines
[18:20.880 --> 18:31.720]  of comparing it to the surface, certainly the surface pros from Microsoft, they, the surface
[18:31.720 --> 18:41.160]  pros are saddled with the overly complex Windows 10. And the iPad pro is saddled with what
[18:41.160 --> 18:47.760]  is still clearly an, a phone operating system. Yeah. Right. And so they're approaching
[18:47.760 --> 18:55.160]  both companies are approaching a, a, they're trying to get to the same place, but Microsoft
[18:55.160 --> 19:02.760]  is going is approaching it with a more complex legacy operating system. And Apple's approaching
[19:02.760 --> 19:10.760]  it with an overly simplistic, meant for a little four, five inch, three, four, five inch device
[19:10.760 --> 19:14.560]  operating system. Right. And I think that's like what's going to be fascinating to watch
[19:14.560 --> 19:19.840]  over the next couple of years is like, how do they both get there? Like, one's got to add
[19:19.840 --> 19:23.920]  one's got to like, you know, it's like, one's got to pick up pieces on the route and
[19:23.920 --> 19:30.440]  the others got to somehow dump them. Hopefully, I don't know what Microsoft's plan is with
[19:30.440 --> 19:37.480]  a lot of the bloat that's in Windows. Um, but yeah. And it's, I totally appreciate that
[19:37.480 --> 19:41.560]  it is an incredibly hard problem for both companies to solve. I mean, a lot of times we,
[19:41.560 --> 19:46.400]  you know, we on the outside can sit here and, and complain and make it, I, I, there are
[19:46.400 --> 19:49.520]  some problems that are frustrating because it really does seem like it ought to be easy for
[19:49.520 --> 19:53.080]  a company to fix. And maybe it's not. And you don't want to, you know, who knows what
[19:53.080 --> 19:58.120]  the reasons are behind it. But this is one where clearly it's complicated. But like, just
[19:58.120 --> 20:03.880]  one specific issue with the pro, I do use the multitasking on the pro that the two things
[20:03.880 --> 20:08.960]  at the same time, multitasking where you slide it out from the left. I do it all the time.
[20:08.960 --> 20:15.520]  And it's one of those things that quickly became habit for me. So and to compare and
[20:15.520 --> 20:21.240]  contrast, I think that it's taken me longer to become a habit is the new, um, the new way
[20:21.240 --> 20:27.440]  in iOS 9 that you can put two fingers on the keyboard and move the, the insertion point
[20:27.440 --> 20:33.760]  around when you're editing text. Yeah, I love it. But I keep forgetting to use it. Whereas
[20:33.760 --> 20:39.720]  multitasking, yeah, same thing. 3D touch. I like it. And, and I'm starting to make it
[20:39.720 --> 20:46.680]  a habit, but it's, I, I keep forgetting about it. Um, whereas the multitasking on the iPad
[20:46.680 --> 20:57.400]  pro is like, I took to it like, yeah, exactly. Um, but yeah. But for example, you
[20:57.400 --> 21:02.840]  can't put to Safari windows side by side. Right. Yeah, I mentioned that in my review.
[21:02.840 --> 21:11.160]  Oh, I've got a stand up. Hold on. My Apple watch is told me. Do you hear it? Yes. Shame
[21:11.160 --> 21:16.160]  you today. I don't know. You don't like you feel guilty hitting that mute for today. Yeah,
[21:16.160 --> 21:23.200]  you get the mute for today. Now, what I do is, uh, I've had sound off on my, my Apple
[21:23.200 --> 21:29.720]  watch for months now. I forget them. It's just been, there's too many times where I want
[21:29.720 --> 21:35.040]  it to be mute. And so I've just less than muted. Okay. I'm not hitting mute for today. Yeah,
[21:35.040 --> 21:38.760]  I feel real in my mind me in like 30 minutes again. And then we can have this conversation
[21:38.760 --> 21:44.440]  over again. I feel bad meeting for the day when it's this early. If it still isn't even
[21:44.440 --> 21:49.760]  dark out, I feel like it's too soon. I was like the days almost over. It's three o'clock.
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.680]  But any, I mean, I have to tell like one AM. So it's not really almost over, but I feel
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.960]  like I can leave the office soon. I think you can always leave an office. Well, this is
[22:00.960 --> 22:07.720]  why I don't. I mean, no one's watching me. I mean, no, no one knows where I am. This is
[22:07.720 --> 22:11.960]  why I was never a good employee, but I've always felt like as soon as it's dark outside,
[22:11.960 --> 22:18.560]  you can leave. So yeah, it's dark outside in New York. Yeah, it's perfect. It makes
[22:18.560 --> 22:23.920]  me a substandard employee, I think. But yeah, I mean, really know what he's watching.
[22:23.920 --> 22:29.800]  My move is there at least that's what I think repairing listening to this. That would
[22:29.800 --> 22:38.240]  be awesome if he was on a Mac or Windows. It would be crazy to think you couldn't have
[22:38.240 --> 22:46.880]  two browser tabs, windows, whatever you want to call them side by side. It would be crazy.
[22:46.880 --> 22:53.760]  And that's where we are though on iOS. And I don't know what the solution is. I think
[22:53.760 --> 22:58.480]  it seems to me like with this, the way that the rules of iOS multitasking where you slide
[22:58.480 --> 23:02.960]  it over. And if you want to switch, which app is in that right hand pain, why can't
[23:02.960 --> 23:08.880]  Safari be listed in there too? Yeah. And actually like I wouldn't mind that on the iPhone
[23:08.880 --> 23:16.560]  too. Like I wouldn't mind being able to separate out tabs as a new window. So like I find
[23:16.560 --> 23:21.400]  it annoying, sometimes I'll go back and forth between two websites. And so you know you've
[23:21.400 --> 23:27.280]  got to hit the tab button in the right corner. Yeah. What if I could just double tap to
[23:27.280 --> 23:36.120]  see two Safari windows side by, you know, in the multitasking trace, carousel thing?
[23:36.120 --> 23:41.720]  It's, you know, I want that sometimes. And the same thing with any, with like a document
[23:41.720 --> 23:47.480]  editing thing, where if God, whatever app you use for text editing, let's just say though
[23:47.480 --> 23:51.680]  you're using the built in notes app. Why wouldn't you want to be able to have two of those
[23:51.680 --> 23:55.560]  side by side? So you could have one that was your notes for an article. And the other is
[23:55.560 --> 24:02.560]  the article you're writing. Absolutely. I mean, I, this is a secret about me. My most used app
[24:02.560 --> 24:06.920]  on my Mac is text edit. I have it right now. That's true for a lot of people. That's,
[24:06.920 --> 24:12.560]  is it? Yeah, I think so. I feel like inferior. Like, you know, it's just like so simple and
[24:12.560 --> 24:21.920]  great. Right now have 20 text edit windows open. I have untitled 21 right now. I just like
[24:21.920 --> 24:28.240]  open them and, you know, jot down notes and then I just close them. Like I, and yes, it's
[24:28.240 --> 24:32.320]  because I have like three of the little ones on my screen right now for like three different
[24:32.320 --> 24:36.480]  things I'm working on. I would love, I would love to be able to put two of them side
[24:36.480 --> 24:43.880]  by side on the on the on the pro. Yeah, I have a text edit on iOS. Yeah, there were rumors
[24:43.880 --> 24:50.720]  last year. The text edit team. I mean, really, what have they been doing? I mean, no offense
[24:50.720 --> 24:57.800]  text edit team, but this has not been many updates to your app since like ever. And maybe
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.880]  they should get on it. I'm just just an advice for the text edit team. Love what you're
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.800]  doing. Love your work. Love your app. It's my most used app on my Mac, but maybe start
[25:06.800 --> 25:13.080]  working on the iOS version. It's funny that there was a rumor last year that there was
[25:13.080 --> 25:22.160]  going to be a text edit for iOS and preview too. Oh, yeah, remember that. Yeah. And the
[25:22.160 --> 25:27.880]  seeming. Preview is another one of my favorites. Yeah. I mean, preview, like, and this is,
[25:27.880 --> 25:32.240]  this is where when I sometimes really try and make the switch back to Windows, these are
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.720]  some of the apps that are so core to the operating system that that Microsoft just doesn't
[25:37.720 --> 25:42.880]  have. Preview is a great example. Microsoft just doesn't have something like preview on
[25:42.880 --> 25:49.880]  Windows 10. Like the basic thing where you can look at photos. Yes, but some of those
[25:49.880 --> 25:55.680]  basic editing tools. And they ease abusing them. Not there. Yeah. All right. Just if you
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.920]  want to make a quick crop or quick crop resize the photo. Stuff. I mean, it's a great
[26:02.920 --> 26:08.760]  preview. Again, the preview team really. I mean, it's probably my second most used app on
[26:08.760 --> 26:18.760]  my Mac. Here's an example there. I got a complimentary review copy of a new book from the
[26:18.760 --> 26:23.360]  people at a list apart last week. Thank you to them for sending it to me. It was very
[26:23.360 --> 26:30.960]  kind. They sent it to me by email and I opened it up and I started reading. And it was
[26:30.960 --> 26:34.880]  actually a book on responsive web design. So it's obviously something I need to read since
[26:34.880 --> 26:40.560]  my website still isn't responsive started reading it. And I don't know. Hours later
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.960]  next day, I wanted to I was like, oh, I want to keep reading that book and I was on the
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.120]  iPad Pro. And I'm like, where the hell is that? And I like blanked out for a couple of
[26:50.120 --> 26:57.280]  seconds. Like, why can't I find it here? And then I realized, oh, there's no preview here.
[26:57.280 --> 27:03.400]  Right. You know, there is a way to do that. You can use I books. You can, you know, open
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.520]  the PDF and I books and it, it'll sync across and you can read on the Mac and read here.
[27:08.520 --> 27:12.520]  But I use preview, not I books to read PDFs because it's, you know, when you double click
[27:12.520 --> 27:17.760]  it, that's what it opens in on your Mac. Right. I mean, I guess on iOS, they just figure
[27:17.760 --> 27:24.040]  photos is the answer. But photos doesn't have support for PDF and some of those kind
[27:24.040 --> 27:32.440]  of features that you have in preview. I think what it is more is that they, even with
[27:32.440 --> 27:39.240]  iCloud and even with the new iCloud drive, which does work pretty well. I think, I mean,
[27:39.240 --> 27:46.400]  in my experience, it's, it syncs pretty, pretty reliably and pretty quickly. But I feel
[27:46.400 --> 27:56.280]  like they, they're averse to adding document oriented apps to iOS. Right. As opposed
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.160]  to, let's say, notes where the new notes app is updated on macOS 10L Capitan and it's
[28:02.160 --> 28:07.360]  updated on iOS. But you don't have files, you know, now technically there are files hidden
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.080]  somewhere in your, you know, library folder somewhere. But there's no files that are actually
[28:12.080 --> 28:17.400]  exposed to you. Whereas preview is still about opening PDF, dot PDF files and text. That's
[28:17.400 --> 28:22.560]  right. And that comes back to our file system conversation. Right. But they have it, they
[28:22.560 --> 28:25.840]  have it with iCloud now and they have the iCloud drive app. But it's almost like they
[28:25.840 --> 28:30.800]  don't want to even, even with the fact that it's that it is now technically possible
[28:30.800 --> 28:37.360]  to do, you know, in iOS in a pretty easy, you know, way. I feel like they're just averse
[28:37.360 --> 28:49.000]  to it on like philosophical grounds almost. Yeah. I mean, the problem with, yeah, I guess
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.680]  if you're using Drive and you really are invested in that, maybe you don't have a lot of
[28:52.680 --> 28:59.720]  these problems. Well, you do have the problem. If some of the apps don't use it. I don't
[28:59.720 --> 29:02.680]  know. I can't say, I can't say, I'm going to go to iCloud Drive. I just can't commit
[29:02.680 --> 29:09.480]  to that. What do you use it at all? Not really. I use it for photos. Is that different?
[29:09.480 --> 29:14.680]  It's different. Yeah. That's different. Because yeah, that's, that's just iCloud photo
[29:14.680 --> 29:21.040]  syncing where it's not really in the files. I live in a Google world. So then what do you
[29:21.040 --> 29:25.120]  Google world? No, I don't, I don't, I don't, I try to use this little Google stuff as
[29:25.120 --> 29:32.280]  possible. So with Google, where do you like, so you use Google Drive to sync documents from
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.800]  one thing to another? Yeah. How does that work in the finder? I don't even know. Like,
[29:36.800 --> 29:43.520]  how does that work on a Mac? It, well, you, you can sync all your Google Drive stuff to
[29:43.520 --> 29:48.280]  your Mac. I actually don't do that. Um, I actually just go through the Chrome browser
[29:48.280 --> 29:54.280]  because I don't want all those files there. And I think that that's more likely the, the
[29:54.280 --> 30:01.280]  most natural way to do it in, I mean, mostly everything for me is right in, um, is in,
[30:01.280 --> 30:08.400]  yeah, it's in Chrome. Yeah. For me, I've, I, I do use iCloud Drive, but it only works
[30:08.400 --> 30:13.440]  with certain apps. I mean, my primary way of like, hey, I, if I have a file that I want
[30:13.440 --> 30:17.240]  to be available everywhere, I put it in my Dropbox folder. Dropbox is the, yeah. It's
[30:17.240 --> 30:23.680]  the more important, way more important to me method. Yeah. I mean, I guess I just, I really
[30:23.680 --> 30:32.920]  use Drive for my documents for like my, yeah, my documents. I'm like actively editing
[30:32.920 --> 30:39.280]  and filing. That's how I actually do file to my editors through Docs Google Docs. Yeah.
[30:39.280 --> 30:42.880]  Now, for me, it's Dropbox. So like anything, like if I'm working on an article for
[30:42.880 --> 30:48.880]  during Fireball, it's a BB at a text file and, but it's saved saved to a, a folder in
[30:48.880 --> 30:57.480]  Dropbox. Hmm. That's a, that's a good workaround. Yeah. I usually write a lot in text
[30:57.480 --> 31:02.960]  that and then copy into, um, I have a weird things. Actually, I write most of my columns
[31:02.960 --> 31:09.280]  in Word. I'm just going to stay right there. Still, I just feel comfortable on a Sunday
[31:09.280 --> 31:13.800]  when I write, I don't even when I write my scripts. I just feel really comfortable in
[31:13.800 --> 31:21.040]  Word. It's just like my, my place, you know, so I just go into, to Word 2001. Yep. So 2011,
[31:21.040 --> 31:27.440]  I'm sorry, 2011. And that's where I am. Yeah, it's, that's a weird thing, I guess. I
[31:27.440 --> 31:34.120]  should probably upgrade this to. Well, not that BB at it isn't relevant, but the fact that
[31:34.120 --> 31:39.080]  I use a programming text editor as my writing thing is, you know, it's not really because
[31:39.080 --> 31:44.320]  I need to. It's, it's just, that's where I've always done my writing. And so it's, it's,
[31:44.320 --> 31:49.200]  you know, it is a comfort thing. I think you want to be as, you know, writers famously,
[31:49.200 --> 31:53.440]  you know, whether they're picky about which brand pencil they use if they write in long
[31:53.440 --> 31:59.400]  hand or, you know, certain brand of typewriter or even like certain, certain types of paper
[31:59.400 --> 32:04.040]  for putting the typewriter. Writers have always been fussy about stuff like that. And I think
[32:04.040 --> 32:10.760]  it's because we have so many problems. Just problems in general. We just tend to probably
[32:10.760 --> 32:14.840]  have like, you know, I just like don't know how I want to write something in our like,
[32:14.840 --> 32:18.360]  if I'm, it's one of those pieces, you know, the iPad was a good example of the pro.
[32:18.360 --> 32:23.080]  There were so many different ways could have gone about it. And I wanted to go about it,
[32:23.080 --> 32:27.880]  but I also had to write for a very mainstream audience on it. And so like, I just had
[32:27.880 --> 32:34.760]  such a hard time figuring out where to start that piece. And I probably opened like every text
[32:34.760 --> 32:39.400]  editing program I had on my computer. And just like, maybe if I write it in here, something
[32:39.400 --> 32:45.080]  will come, you know, like you just every procrastination technique. And it usually involves opening
[32:45.080 --> 32:52.360]  like every text editor I have on my computer. I'm like that sometimes too, especially with
[32:52.360 --> 32:56.600]  with the iPad pro where I wanted to write my review on the iPad pro. So I didn't have
[32:56.600 --> 33:02.040]  BB at it. So it wasn't like, you know, so I just started writing in three or four different apps.
[33:02.040 --> 33:06.280]  And then I got very confused about, well, where's the part that I wrote about the pencil? Oh,
[33:06.280 --> 33:10.440]  it's in the other app. Yeah. No, I did the same kind of thing because I was actually
[33:10.440 --> 33:16.280]  the day I started like sitting down to write, it was running the battery test. So I was writing
[33:16.280 --> 33:22.280]  on my Mac, but then I actually ended up writing a lot of it in pages because it was, you know,
[33:22.280 --> 33:28.280]  I used, I guess I used iCloud Drive for that. Yeah, you must. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:28.920 --> 33:33.080]  You didn't even know it though. It didn't even know it. All right, let me take a break here and
[33:33.080 --> 33:38.840]  thank my first sponsor. And it's our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace.
[33:38.840 --> 33:46.840]  It's the all in one way to build design and host your website. And it can be any sort of website.
[33:46.840 --> 33:53.400]  You can build an online store. You can create a portfolio. You can create a blog. You could use it
[33:53.400 --> 33:58.680]  to host a podcast. They even have like it for podcasting. They even, you know, they even have
[33:58.680 --> 34:04.680]  their own custom audio player. They even support built in things like building an RSS feed with
[34:04.680 --> 34:09.320]  all the weird iTunes stuff you need for a podcast. Anything you, anything you need for your own
[34:09.320 --> 34:13.800]  personal website or a company website or any sort of website or even a website for your dog.
[34:13.800 --> 34:19.320]  Yeah, a website for your dog. You can use. Go to, you know, I'm not above this. You know how I
[34:19.320 --> 34:24.120]  like to talk about your sponsors. I actually did this also on the verge cast a couple weeks ago.
[34:25.240 --> 34:30.440]  I wrote about how to build your own website a couple of months ago. And I fell in love with
[34:30.440 --> 34:37.000]  Squarespace. And I actually made my whole concept was I'm going to make a website for my dog.
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.680]  And so when you go to browser and your browser dot com now, that was made with Squarespace.
[34:42.680 --> 34:44.600]  What's the website? What's the address?
[34:45.480 --> 34:51.400]  Browser in your browser dot com. Browser in your browser dot com. And there's an example of a website
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.720]  built with Squarespace. I just want to also say Squarespace does not pay me.
[34:56.440 --> 34:59.480]  I do not make the rounds on podcasts to talk about Squarespace.
[35:04.040 --> 35:07.000]  There it is. There it is. Browser in your browser dot com.
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.880]  Tell me this is a really nice website. Okay. It really is. It really is.
[35:14.520 --> 35:21.800]  I even, it's even type set in one of my all time favorite fonts. It's a beautiful gorgeous
[35:21.800 --> 35:29.320]  future of bold. It's gorgeous. Thank you. It really is. Joanna Stern isn't even paid for this.
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.920]  I am, but I'm telling you right now, if you need a website, spend an hour in the Squarespace
[35:34.920 --> 35:39.960]  for free and before you try doing it any other way and you will be surprised at how far you go.
[35:41.400 --> 35:47.480]  Plan start at unbelievable $8 a month, which includes everything. Like it's not just like,
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.640]  oh, you build your website and then you have to go find a web host, which is where you're going to
[35:51.640 --> 35:55.480]  host it. You know, you've got like a big pile of HTML files and stuff and you upload them.
[35:55.480 --> 36:01.160]  No, it's all built in. Squarespace does it all. You get a free trial to start.
[36:01.160 --> 36:06.360]  No credit card required. Just go to squarespace.com and when you do sign up to start paying,

[36:13.240 --> 36:17.320]  purchase. Build it beautiful. Go to Squarespace. Seriously, beautiful, beautiful website.
[36:17.320 --> 36:27.080]  Easy to build. I really like that. I'm paying, I'm actually paying the $9 a month like you just said
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.760]  for the custom domain and for the hosting and I need to update the site. I need to,
[36:32.760 --> 36:38.280]  tonight, I'm updating the site. Yeah, because people are going to go and it is nicely,
[36:38.280 --> 36:42.440]  it is actually very nicely responsive to here. I am dragging the window around in it.
[36:42.440 --> 36:45.880]  I don't know what's really well on mobile and that's one of the nice things. You can see the
[36:45.880 --> 36:53.960]  view. You can see the mobile view. I did a whole column on it. I mean, it was a really fun
[36:53.960 --> 37:00.040]  piece. They sponsor so many podcasts and I know that people, I don't know if people tune it out
[37:00.040 --> 37:06.040]  or what, but it's a remarkable surface. It really is. There's nothing else like it. I can't think
[37:06.040 --> 37:10.440]  of anything. I know there's other ways to host websites. I can't think of other ways. You should
[37:10.440 --> 37:17.560]  read my article. But in the end, all you need to know is that Squarespace was the top pick that
[37:17.560 --> 37:22.520]  one browser on your browser.com. There we go. But I reviewed like three or four of them. I really
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.440]  went through the things. I mean, it was a really popular article because a lot of our readers
[37:26.440 --> 37:31.720]  have small businesses and we're interested in, I got tons of interesting emails of people who
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.880]  wanted to launch websites just for small things they wanted to do and they couldn't believe how easy
[37:35.880 --> 37:43.480]  it was. Yeah. I need to go work for Squarespace. What am I saying? I need to go. I basically sell
[37:43.480 --> 37:53.400]  Squarespace subscriptions or whatever they people sell there. All right, next device on the list.
[37:55.400 --> 38:03.080]  I would love to pick your mind about the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book.
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.440]  I have to, I actually just got the mailroom just dropped off the latest Surface Book,
[38:10.440 --> 38:17.160]  which they tell me Microsoft descent says this is the shipping unit. I should have no problems.
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.480]  But that's where I should back up and talk about some of the problems I have, but I have to take it
[38:21.480 --> 38:29.240]  out of the box. Yeah. What an interesting, what an interesting series of announcements from
[38:29.240 --> 38:37.560]  Microsoft. You know, the book. My review was very, I'll actually just be honest and tell you
[38:37.560 --> 38:43.800]  the story about what happened with the review. So I loved using the Surface Book. I think it's an
[38:43.800 --> 38:50.040]  incredible piece of hardware that Microsoft made. Everything from sort of the screen to how the
[38:50.040 --> 38:56.440]  keyboard works and the trackpad actually finally working very, very well. After years of reviewing
[38:58.040 --> 39:05.480]  just really just terrible. I mean, I have probably a lot of emotional and psychological
[39:05.480 --> 39:13.320]  issues because of how many terrible Windows laptops I've reviewed. It was just such a nice
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.320]  change. It's just such a, it was just, you know, it's just, it was a really big step, I think,
[39:19.880 --> 39:26.760]  in the history of Windows laptops. So wrote this really good review and then the first unit I had,
[39:28.120 --> 39:34.840]  had some issues. Actually, the first Surface Pro 4 I had had some issues and so it wouldn't restart.
[39:34.840 --> 39:42.680]  And then the Surface Book, the first one I had had a driver issue and so it kind of kept crashing.
[39:42.680 --> 39:51.480]  And then they sent me another one and about, I don't know, 24 hours before filing or that review
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.760]  going up, the thing just completely crashed. The hard drive just completely crashed, couldn't restart
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.920]  Windows. And I don't know, there was a couple of other bugs that they said were going to be sorted
[40:00.920 --> 40:07.400]  through. And then other reviewers had the same problem. So I ended up basically saying I couldn't
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.400]  recommend the Surface Book. And so now I'm at a point where I'm retesting it to see if they did
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.840]  solve this hard drive problem. It sounds like what I, from what I can tell and I did not get one
[40:18.840 --> 40:28.360]  to review, but because I'm not really in that racket, but I've seen it. And I was at like a Microsoft
[40:28.360 --> 40:35.080]  event here in Philadelphia where Ben Rudolph, you know, who's like the lead evangelist for these
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.560]  things. You know, they hosted a thing and he was kind enough to invite me and I got to spend some
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.400]  time using it there. But you know, it's very different than spending a week with it. But it sounds
[40:43.400 --> 40:50.520]  to me from reading everything that what Microsoft did is they seeded the review units before they
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.640]  had the, whatever you want to call it, Golden Master. This is what's going to go out to consumers.
[40:55.640 --> 41:00.600]  And there, you know, we're some pretty serious bugs because it wasn't just you. It was pretty much
[41:00.600 --> 41:05.880]  everybody kind of ran into the same issues. Yeah, I mean, there were bugs and then there were
[41:05.880 --> 41:12.360]  hardware problems. And I think the bugs definitely did make it into shipping units. I got many
[41:12.360 --> 41:18.360]  emails and tweets from readers who said I had the same problems. I just went back to the Microsoft
[41:18.360 --> 41:25.960]  Store. I returned it. You know, there was some clear quality control issues that just clear
[41:25.960 --> 41:31.240]  issues that made it through to shipping units. I didn't hear about the hard drive failures.
[41:31.240 --> 41:37.720]  You know, yes, and Microsoft did say that they had sent review units with different hard drives
[41:37.720 --> 41:43.960]  and they had caught these issues at the factory. So I had had the problem first on the Surface Pro
[41:43.960 --> 41:50.280]  4 and then again, you know, the Surface Book as well. So yeah, I'm hoping this time around,
[41:50.280 --> 41:56.520]  everything goes as well. And I can go as well. And I can actually, you know, really recommend this
[41:56.520 --> 42:05.560]  as the best Windows laptop ever made. But does it have an actual hard drive in it? It's not an SSD?
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.760]  They're SSDs. Yeah, but they had problems. They had problems. Yeah, I'm sorry. Keeps using
[42:10.760 --> 42:17.480]  the word hard drive. But yeah, they're SSDs with some sort of issue. And as far as I understand,
[42:17.480 --> 42:25.720]  they actually changed out the manufacturer of it. Interesting. So let's give them the benefit of
[42:25.720 --> 42:32.200]  the doubt for now and talk about it as what it's supposed to be, you know, and but let's
[42:32.200 --> 42:41.800]  assume that they're going to iron out the bugs and the manufacturing issues and talk about it just
[42:41.800 --> 42:52.440]  for what it, you know, what it should be. Yeah, I mean, you know, I took this like funny, I mean,
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.240]  I think one of the things that's been interesting about Microsoft over the last year is like,
[42:57.240 --> 43:04.760]  you know, when they looked at the tablet market, they had to kind of say, well, what's our strength?
[43:04.760 --> 43:11.720]  Our strength is not what the iPad is. We haven't created a really touch-friendly platform that works
[43:11.720 --> 43:17.400]  or we have, but it didn't, we tried to create a touch-friendly platform and it failed, you know,
[43:17.400 --> 43:24.680]  Windows 8 was, was by and large, obviously a huge failure. And we haven't got the apps to make this
[43:24.680 --> 43:30.360]  that really great immersive compelling experience that the iPad has. But what we do find is people
[43:30.360 --> 43:36.360]  want to do more work on these things. So we want to make tablets more productive, which really was
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.120]  like, okay, we're going to make tablets that can replace your laptop. And it was like, okay,
[43:40.120 --> 43:45.160]  so why don't you just make a laptop? Like the tablet really couldn't replace your laptop. I mean,
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.320]  it could, but it wasn't as good as a laptop. And it certainly wasn't as good as the laptops.
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.440]  They had kept putting it up against, which was the air. So they kept kind of convincing us like,
[43:55.080 --> 43:59.960]  we're really good at productivity. And so you should want to buy our device that can actually be a
[43:59.960 --> 44:05.640]  good laptop. And it was like, just make a laptop. And so now they made a laptop, but it's actually
[44:05.640 --> 44:10.520]  still a tablet. And so kind of just like, you know, and that's trying to wrap my head around
[44:10.520 --> 44:14.840]  the whole industry right now, which is, you know, tablets that want to be laptops, laptops that
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.280]  want to be tablets. And in the case of Microsoft, they've got a phone that wants to be a desktop,
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.520]  you know, what are all of this kind of hybridization of things and what do we actually want to use?
[44:28.040 --> 44:31.960]  And I think with the Surface Brook, it's actually coming to a point where it's like, okay,
[44:31.960 --> 44:38.440]  this could just kind of feels like the future. It doesn't, it isn't the best right now. It's not a
[44:38.440 --> 44:43.240]  great tablet. It's actually a pretty terrible tablet when you think about that. The battery life
[44:43.240 --> 44:49.240]  is really bad when to take it off the dock. But the idea that, you know, tablets can just be the
[44:49.240 --> 44:55.480]  tops of our laptops and that keyboards are just being added back to these things to make them laptops.
[44:55.480 --> 45:00.200]  Well, that makes kind of sense. That makes sense, you know. And so I kind of looked at it from
[45:00.200 --> 45:04.120]  that perspective. And then I just really tried to look at it as like, this is just a Windows
[45:04.120 --> 45:10.680]  laptop. And it's like, got the builds of an Apple laptop. It's got a touchpad that actually works
[45:10.680 --> 45:16.040]  that I don't want to hook up a huge mouse to it. It's got a beautiful screen. And so on hardware,
[45:16.680 --> 45:22.760]  Microsoft's finally giving us something that, you know, heightens and makes Windows worth it.
[45:24.680 --> 45:32.440]  I threw out a lot of thoughts. But no, but that's, so when I was at the iPad Pro event in September
[45:32.440 --> 45:38.440]  and in the hands-on area, I was hanging out with my friend Michael Johnson, aka Dr. Wave on Twitter,
[45:38.440 --> 45:46.040]  who's a developer at Pixar. And writes, you know, internal tools for Pixar and has written a lot
[45:46.040 --> 45:53.000]  of software to use the Wacom tablets and also, you know, for their artists, I hung around with him
[45:53.000 --> 45:58.520]  because he knows what the hell he's talking about in terms of evaluating, you know, a stylist on a
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.080]  thing. And one of the things he did when he first got to try the Apple pencil on the iPad Pro is
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.040]  all he did is just, and then like the Apple Notes app. He just put the pencil down and just started
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.320]  scribbling circles, just spirally circles and just watching the latency. That's all he did.
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.040]  Just to see, and he was very impressed. And you know, all he wanted to test it first was the palm
[46:20.040 --> 46:26.760]  rejection. And if he drew squiggles really, really fast, did it keep up? That's exactly what I did
[46:26.760 --> 46:34.040]  when I got to try the surface book with the trackpad is I just wanted to see, just put my finger
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.680]  on the trackpad and look at the mouse cursor and I just moved it around, you know, in a circle really
[46:38.680 --> 46:45.880]  fast to see is this, does this work like a MacBook trackpad where it's great or is it like every
[46:45.880 --> 46:51.960]  other PC I've ever put my hands on in recent years where it's, you know, oh man, I can see why people
[46:51.960 --> 46:59.320]  still miss the ThinkPad nubbin because the trackpad sings. And it was great. I mean, the surface
[46:59.320 --> 47:04.440]  pro trackpad. I mean, again, I did I spend a week with it. No, but in terms of just that quick test,
[47:04.440 --> 47:13.080]  it was great. I mean, I'm the reviewer who has said for the last five years, it is probably Apple's
[47:13.080 --> 47:19.480]  most favorite thing that I have said that Apple makes the best Windows computer. And I said it
[47:19.480 --> 47:23.720]  when I was working at and gadget. I said when I was working at the verge and I've said it
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.800]  when I've been working here at the journal, when you install Windows on a MacBook Air or a MacBook
[47:29.800 --> 47:36.120]  Pro, Windows runs better there than it does on pretty much any other laptop I've ever tested in the
[47:36.120 --> 47:44.600]  last 10 years. And that was a problem for Microsoft, you know, as more and more people by iPhones,
[47:45.240 --> 47:50.440]  more and more people see what Apple does in terms of hardware and software collaboration.
[47:50.440 --> 47:56.200]  That is a problem for Microsoft, especially in the place where they most want us to look to them,
[47:56.200 --> 48:02.760]  which is work, doing things. And so I think, you know, that's where the surface book,
[48:03.720 --> 48:09.480]  okay, maybe they're not going to sell as many as they may want. And I think that they,
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.160]  I think the pricing structure and is certainly if you ask my opinion, I think a lot of it is to
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.360]  protect the OEMs and their partners right now. I think there's very clear delineation of what's
[48:20.360 --> 48:26.760]  been happening. You know, this is a computer that starts well above $1,200 once you get it to where you
[48:26.760 --> 48:34.840]  want it, most PC buyers buy things under $1,000. But still, I just think as a as a proof of concept
[48:34.840 --> 48:40.520]  and for Microsoft to say, look, we can actually make great hardware for a really great operating
[48:40.520 --> 48:50.760]  system that we have out right now, we can do it too. Yeah, they're dancing in a very precarious
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.720]  situation dealing with the OEMs. And they have been ever since they started with the very first
[48:57.720 --> 49:04.120]  surface, which was really, you know, clearly not as much, you know, as more of a, even that,
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.080]  you know, when did the first one, they had the two versions, one, it was the surface that was arm
[49:09.080 --> 49:14.040]  and mo, you know, way more like an iPad and ran a different version of Windows and then they had
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.520]  the surface pro, which had an Intel chip and ran the full version of Windows eight, even though it
[49:18.520 --> 49:26.040]  was a full Windows eight computer, it was clearly less of a, hey, this isn't a true alternative to
[49:26.040 --> 49:33.000]  a laptop from Dell or from Lenovo or whoever else, HP whoever, you know, Nick, you name him.
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.720]  It was definitely this is like a new concept. Whereas the, you know, now they've, you know,
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.440]  starting from that point, they're clearly, and now with the surface book, they are clearly
[49:42.440 --> 49:49.080]  had they have an alternative to a laptop from one of their OEM partners, and that's a weird place
[49:49.080 --> 49:55.960]  for them to be. Right. And I think you're right. Looking now to see the pricing, they had a more
[49:55.960 --> 50:03.000]  cheaper skew and it's not here now. It's $1,500 starting right now. Right, which is definitely
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.560]  premium, even by Apple standards. Yeah. I mean, most people are buying that $1,000 air.
[50:10.200 --> 50:17.320]  Right. It, it definitely has impressive build quality though. And I'm not surprised by that.
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.920]  I think the entire story of this, this device, the fact that the first units that were sent out
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.880]  had these weird bugs and manufacturing things. Well, you know, guess what hardware is hard and
[50:27.880 --> 50:36.200]  Microsoft is still sort of new at it. And it's a tribute to the expertise of the existing
[50:36.200 --> 50:42.760]  companies, Apple certainly, but even on the PC side, you know, that most PCs that you test,
[50:42.760 --> 50:47.320]  right, don't have those sort of problems. That's unusual for you to get a review unit that has
[50:47.320 --> 51:04.520]  problems like this, right? Yes. Well, it's hot. I'm trying to think back. I have had many instances
[51:04.520 --> 51:12.280]  where PC manufacturers had really messed up certain components and they just did not work.
[51:12.280 --> 51:20.440]  Um, yeah, but you know what, you kind of seemed more forgivable in that in those senses.
[51:21.240 --> 51:26.360]  How about this? An usual, but not unprecedented. Yes, yes, absolutely.
[51:27.560 --> 51:30.760]  So it's not surprising that they're there to me that they're having those problems.
[51:32.200 --> 51:38.440]  But on the other hand, they have been making Microsoft has made peripherals for a long time.
[51:38.440 --> 51:43.160]  I mean, as long as I can remember, Microsoft has been making mice and keyboards and their,
[51:43.160 --> 51:48.760]  their mice and keyboards have always been excellent. I mean, truly top notch.
[51:50.920 --> 51:55.560]  Yeah. Oh, by the way, I want to say corrected the entry level is 1500. I don't know. For some
[51:55.560 --> 52:02.680]  reason, I thought it was 1300. It's, it's 1500 on the surface book. Hmm. So I'm, I'm
[52:02.680 --> 52:09.800]  not surprised. And I also thought great peripheral referrals. I thought that I thought that the keyboard
[52:09.800 --> 52:15.320]  on the surface book was excellent. The trackpad was excellent. The driver support to make sure
[52:15.320 --> 52:22.600]  that the good hardware trackpad actually translated to a good experience on screen was absolutely
[52:22.600 --> 52:32.040]  seamless. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the, the issues really did come down to, I think there were some bugs
[52:32.040 --> 52:37.400]  and issues with the drivers for the display. That was causing a couple of flickering issues and
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.000]  then obviously there was other things. So I'm excited to take this one out of the box and see how it
[52:41.000 --> 52:47.720]  goes. Um, but I know I've heard from a lot of happy buyers. I mean, um, you know, when it comes to,
[52:47.720 --> 52:53.560]  I mean, it's also really, really powerful system. So, um, I don't like the pen too. I mean,
[52:53.560 --> 53:01.640]  I actually still now prefer the iPad Pro pen over the surface pen, um, though I've lost both of them.
[53:01.640 --> 53:08.280]  So that's, uh, way in your review, you said you only had lost the cap, but now you've lost the
[53:08.280 --> 53:16.120]  entire pencil. I think I know where it is. I mean, this is a really big problem. I mean, it's
[53:16.120 --> 53:22.520]  2015 and we cannot find our styluses. We, we need a better way to keep track of our styluses.
[53:23.640 --> 53:29.800]  And actually, I have to say, Samsung, they have that feature where if this, if the stylus goes
[53:29.800 --> 53:34.920]  too far away, it will, uh, tell you on your phone. I don't know if they have that in the current
[53:34.920 --> 53:40.840]  note, but they had it. Something like that is, I think, kind of the key to, to the, to the prevention
[53:40.840 --> 53:50.120]  of the loss or the kidnapping of the styluses. I thought about the, like, I kind of, I do enjoy
[53:50.120 --> 53:57.080]  one of my favorite Apple Watch features is the, um, make your phone beep. Yeah. Um,
[53:57.080 --> 54:01.880]  I thought about that. Exactly. We need something like that. Well, but the problem, I think would be
[54:01.880 --> 54:08.360]  that I suspect that the, the pencil, I suspect that the pencil turned, well, yeah, it would need,
[54:08.360 --> 54:13.080]  A, it would need a speaker and B, it would need to be on all the time. Like the reason it works for
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.320]  finding your phone is that until a phone is off, it's on in some degree and the pencil,
[54:17.320 --> 54:23.320]  I think one of the reasons it gets such a seemingly amazing battery life is that it somehow turns
[54:23.320 --> 54:30.840]  off in a very intelligent manner when you're not using it. Yes. And so I don't know, you know,
[54:30.840 --> 54:37.080]  it's also like, they have, um, I did a piece a couple of a year or two, a year ago about the
[54:37.080 --> 54:43.960]  Bluetooth low energy trackers. And so those work when they're in the vicinity of your phone.
[54:45.320 --> 54:50.440]  So possibly, and, and there's really interesting crowd sourcing stuff that's happening with those,
[54:50.440 --> 54:55.160]  that if those are in the proximity of another one of those, like having, you've seen the
[54:55.160 --> 55:00.760]  tile trackers or the tracker, like those, those can talk to each other. So what if all the
[55:00.760 --> 55:09.240]  styluses could talk to each other? That would be something. It needs to be solved. It's definitely
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.280]  a problem. It's definitely a problem. It needs to have many conversations with Apple. Number one,
[55:14.280 --> 55:18.440]  let's talk about the styluses talking to each other. Number two, let's talk about text edit.
[55:18.440 --> 55:25.720]  Number three, let's talk about an ad where iPad lovers fall in love around the iPad.
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.480]  A shared movie. A shared, all these things could happen in one ad.
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.400]  All right, I want to take a break here. And I want to thank our next friend of the show,
[55:36.120 --> 55:42.840]  next advertiser. It is our good friends at Wealthfront. Wealthfront is offers long-term passive
[55:42.840 --> 55:49.800]  investing as dictated by strategies in modern portfolio theory. This is academically proven
[55:49.800 --> 55:56.360]  an approved way to invest for the long-term. How things in your portfolio should move in
[55:56.360 --> 56:02.200]  relationship to each other so that you have a balanced portfolio that is adjusted to your
[56:02.200 --> 56:08.600]  tolerance for risk, all sorts of stuff. A long story short, it's a replacement for a financial
[56:08.600 --> 56:14.360]  advisor. It's automated and algorithmic. You invest your money. You give them your money and they
[56:14.360 --> 56:20.840]  take care of it for you automatically. It's just a way to invest for the long-term. Why would you
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.640]  use it instead of a financial manager? Well, a financial manager usually takes about one to three
[56:27.640 --> 56:37.640]  percent fees. One percent is around the average. Wealthfront only takes 0.25 percent. And even then,
[56:37.640 --> 56:44.040]  they only take that fee on what you've invested over $10,000. And they have a special deal
[56:44.040 --> 56:49.960]  for listeners of the show. If you take the URL that I'm going to give you at the end,
[56:51.640 --> 56:59.640]  they will only apply their fees after $15,000. And the fee only applies to what you have invested
[56:59.640 --> 57:07.560]  above $15,000. So if you invest $15,000 and $1, they only charge that 0.25 percent fee on the
[57:07.560 --> 57:14.280]  dollar that's over $15,000. You can get started as low as $500. And in fact, that's what most of
[57:14.280 --> 57:20.360]  their customers do. Most people sign up and to test the waters, they just put $500 or $1,000 in,
[57:20.360 --> 57:25.560]  see how it works. And then they put, quote unquote, real money in only after they're happy with it.
[57:26.440 --> 57:30.600]  Really, really simple. It's a way to invest for the long-term and not worry about it.
[57:31.880 --> 57:36.600]  How is it better than doing something like tossing money at the S&P 500 index? It's because
[57:36.600 --> 57:44.040]  they automatically, it's not just one index fund with a list of companies, they do some kind of
[57:44.040 --> 57:47.720]  complicated thing that you can go to their website and read about if you want to see the details,
[57:48.840 --> 57:55.240]  balance it automatically. So if one spectrum of your portfolio starts going up,
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.280]  they might move more of the money in that direction and take less out of some industry where stocks
[58:00.280 --> 58:07.400]  are going down. I have to read this at the end. Go there, check it out. Here's what you do to go

[58:19.320 --> 58:25.160]  myself out of prison. For compliance purposes, I have to tell you that Wealthfront L incorporated

[58:58.440 --> 59:05.880]  really does. I can't use it. That's part of the deal with the SEC stuff is if you are being paid by
[59:05.880 --> 59:12.520]  them as an advertiser, I'm not allowed to invest the money with them. But it's certainly it's
[59:12.520 --> 59:22.200]  interesting. But it spooks me out that I have this show is obviously sort of a seat of the pants
[59:22.200 --> 59:28.920]  operation. And it really spooks me that they're like the thing comes with this big bold thing.
[59:28.920 --> 59:32.520]  And I've spoken to them on the phone to get briefed on how the whole thing works. And they're
[59:32.520 --> 59:38.280]  very nice people. But to have an all-caps bold, you must read this for legal purposes thing.
[59:38.280 --> 59:50.600]  It freaks me that a lot. With the Surface Book, I think you're clearly a laptop first
[59:50.600 --> 59:58.120]  in a tablet second for multiple reasons. It's part of the GPU processing is in the part that you
[59:58.120 --> 1:00:03.480]  detach. It's in the keyboard part. And like you said, it doesn't get...
[1:00:03.480 --> 1:00:15.480]  And the battery life is all in the keyboard. But it's way less cumbersome than I thought.
[1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:19.400]  It's including the software support in Windows.
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:26.360]  Yeah, I mean a lot of people also complained about the screen wobble. That was like a deal
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:30.600]  breaker for some people. I mean, the screen wobble is not a deal breaker for me.
[1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:37.320]  I mean, yeah, like when you shake the top of the screen, it certainly wobbles more than a laptop
[1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:43.880]  that has a very sturdy hinge. But yeah, not a deal breaker, I think the screen wobble.
[1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:49.880]  Oh, I think the Apple had had a screen wobble like that. And it's like, I don't know. I don't know
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:52.040]  how I'd feel if Apple had a screen wobble like that.
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:01:00.120]  Well, I think if a MacBook had screen wobble like that, but it didn't detach,
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:05.880]  you could just... It would be a pure complaint. Like the other ones don't wobble. This one wobbles.
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:11.240]  You know, what in the world is wrong with this hinge. Whereas if it wobbles, but it's because you
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:17.640]  can detach it, it's a trade off. It's obviously not ideal, but it is a trade off. And I think it's
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:25.400]  fair to say that, for example, with the iPad Pro, when you connect the Apple smart keyboard,
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:33.560]  I can use it on my lap. I, in fact, I have. I've used it on my lap resting on my thighs.
[1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:40.840]  And I've found it sturdy at work. Yeah, but it wobbles. I mean, I think a wobbles more than the
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:48.360]  Surface book would. Yeah. And in my iPad Pro video, I showed it wobbling off. But that's more,
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:57.080]  that's actually not, that's more a top heavy. I think that's more because the smart cover,
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:04.840]  the smart keyboard case is ways less than the tablet. So when you put it on your, you know,
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:11.320]  when you put it on your leg, and it's not on an even plane, it doesn't have the balancing to
[1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:17.400]  balance itself out. Doesn't have the weight, the evenness of the weight. But yeah, no, I mean,
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:25.640]  yeah, I like certainly there are compromises that you're making in design now for either
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:31.080]  either option, right? And it's like, I don't really know what to call these things. But when you're
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:37.160]  trying to put a tablet with the keyboard, you're sacrificing some of the best things about a laptop,
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:43.560]  which is using it on your lap, or using it while you're still your lap. You know, I just think of
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.160]  the scenarios when I actually use it on my lap, which is either sitting in bed or on a couch.
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:53.960]  And then when you're combining the tablet with the sort of the laptop, you know, whatever you want
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:57.880]  to call these things that are sort of laptops with tablets, like the Surface book,
[1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:04.120]  you are making compromises in some of the laptop design. So whether that be the screen, hinge,
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:11.160]  or battery, or can't think of another example right now, there's something else, but I can't
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:17.480]  think of it. You know, so there are these form factor compromises we're making on both sides.
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.320]  And you know, and that's what like is so hard right now, you know, like how I started the
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:30.280]  conversations, like it's so hard to tell to ask people or to recommend things when it comes down
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:37.720]  to what a user's willing to compromise, right? I mean, when I look at the differences between
[1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:43.640]  something like a Surface Pro 4 and the iPad Pro, there's such different products. There are so
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:49.400]  many different compromises you'd make on either side, whether it's because of how the hardware
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:56.200]  was designed or because of how the software is so different. And you know, that's like, that's
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:02.520]  what is very confusing about what's happening and computing. And part of me wonders, does all of
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:09.000]  this have to be happening right now? You know, is this partially on the window side to get people
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.360]  more interested again in buying PCs? Is it just that laptops were boring and people weren't buying
[1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:19.880]  them? I don't know. On the iPad side, I wonder, is this a way just to get more people interested
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:26.280]  again in the iPad because they were want them to do more things? You know, and it just, it
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:31.320]  ultimately comes down to when you're choosing your computer now, what is it that you want these
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:34.920]  things to do? And what are you going to live with? What are the compromises you're going to live with?
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:43.960]  I find it, and it's this is not a normal problem that most people have, but because I have
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:49.560]  review units of all of these various products, I have all three iPad sizes here, and they're all
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:57.800]  set up for me ready to go. And I have my MacBook Pro, and I find it hard at any given moment
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:03.240]  to choose, which for like if I'm going to go away for a week, which is what we did last week
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:07.240]  for Thanksgiving, family went away for a week, which iPad do I want to take with me? I don't
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:12.520]  want to take them all. And so I took the, just to get a break because I've been using the iPad
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:18.040]  Pro so much, I thought let's go to the complete opposite end of the lineup, and I just took the iPad
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:26.040]  Mini with me. And one of the reasons I did that was also because my phone is on Verizon, my iPad
[1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:32.360]  Mini is on AT&T, and I find that that's a really useful combination while traveling because you can go
[1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:37.480]  somewhere where maybe one or the other has terrible service, but if the other one does, you can
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:46.520]  just use that one. And I really liked it. I still like the iPad Mini a lot. It's just good at very
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:54.600]  different things though. Oh, what iPhone do you have? It's iPhone 6, not 6x, but not not the
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:06:01.720]  Plus. Right. I can't stand right. Yeah, I don't like the Plus either, but I just did this smartphone
[1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:11.000]  buyer's guide and it's like on paper, the Plus is so much better. Like it is the iPhone I should
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:18.600]  have, but I don't like using it. Like it's just so big. Yeah, technically it is clearly the best
[1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:25.880]  device, the image stabilization for video and the battery life and the photos are just,
[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:30.040]  and you'd think like those are the two most important things we want in phones right now,
[1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:33.720]  right? Like better cameras and better battery life. Why don't I just get this bigger phone and I
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:39.640]  just can, you know, and I also when I reviewed it, I just couldn't like gravitate towards the Plus.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:46.760]  I just hope with the with the seven or the next version that maybe they figure out a way to get
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:52.280]  the bigger screen into a smaller body and we won't have to make the sacrifices of these things
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:57.240]  because the phone will just feel smaller. Yeah, I don't care even care about the bigger,
[1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:01.480]  getting a bit more screen on the smaller device. I just want, I just don't want to device
[1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:05.480]  that's any physically bigger than this. And I would, I would, I just will hope that they can
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:10.280]  figure out is to get the optical image stabilization in the smaller one. And it would be wonderful
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:15.000]  if they could get the battery life or the Plus in the small one, but I'm not holding my breath on that
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:20.840]  one. Right. Yeah. But I totally see why some people do. I know our, our, our, you know, our friend
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:26.600]  Neelai is a Plus user. And I was talking about it. He has giant hands. He has giant hands, but he
[1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:33.480]  also told me that he most days literally does most of his work on his phone. Right. And if that's
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:39.320]  true for anybody, you know, like it tons and tons. So many people. Yeah. And if that's, if that's
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:43.640]  true that you actually do send most of your email from your phone and stuff like that,
[1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:49.960]  I can totally see why having the bigger keyboard, you know, for two thumb typing and the extra battery
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:56.520]  life is a killer feature. I totally understand why some people love the Plus. I, I, it's just not
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:02.200]  for me. Yeah. Same. No, I, I mean, and I always want to like, when I was doing the smartphone
[1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:06.360]  buyers and I was like, I'm going to, I'm going to do it. I put my sim in there, use it for a day. I just,
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:10.760]  I just can't. And then I just bought a new six ass on Sunday.
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:17.240]  Did you really? Yeah. Well, I had been using the review unit for. Yeah. And it was time,
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:27.320]  it was time to send back everything. So I now have a brand new six plus or six S. Um, well,
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:33.000]  hold that thought that that's actually a good point. So one of the things that we go through as
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:38.840]  reviewers of these things is we have to set up these devices more often than most people because
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:44.440]  it's, you know, at least three times a year, I have to set one up. I get us, because now I get two
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:50.040]  review units, the six S and the six S plus. And then I buy my own one that I actually use.
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:09:00.760]  I think that the, the setup process for going to buying a new iPhone is terrible.
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:05.480]  I just tweeted. Did you see my tweet earlier this week? No, didn't even see it. I said,
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:10.920]  I don't, I'm going to, I can't pull it up right now, but maybe I can't. I said, I got a new iPhone
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:18.280]  six S. I'm not restoring from backup. I'm just setting it up as a new phone. Hashtag yellow.
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:26.280]  Because usually I do a restore. And I'm not doing the restore anymore.
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:30.920]  Hmm. I wonder that might, maybe that's the way to go.
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:36.280]  It's just freeing like this phone. It's like, of course, it's brand new, but it feels really
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:43.480]  still brand new. It's not slow with like tons of apps and folders that I never use. It, um,
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.960]  yeah, I mean, that's the big thing, right? It doesn't carry over the apps. Everything else
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:52.600]  was blacked up to the cloud. All right. I mean, it didn't, and it also doesn't pull over your
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:59.240]  eye. So I got into this conversation online. The, the big thing that it, I, the biggest sacrifice you
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:06.520]  make now is that your eye watch, your eye watch, your Apple watch, um, activity data does not
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:11.960]  make its way over. Hmm, which is terrible. That doesn't make it terrible. That,
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:16.520]  everyone said privacy. And I was like, I just wish there was an option to opt in, to sync that to
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:23.080]  the cloud and bring it over to my new iPhone. Yeah, I, and one of the things that I've seen people
[1:10:23.080 --> 1:10:28.520]  complain about and this isn't my complaint is, is I've seen people complain about and somebody
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:34.680]  made like a diagram and posted it to Twitter where it was like in 2007 from like out of the box
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:40.680]  to using it, you're, you know, the original iPhone. It was like three things, you know, three little
[1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:45.560]  screens you went through and then boom, you're at the home screen. And now there's like 21 steps
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:50.360]  that you go through. But I don't, that's not the part that I find terrible because I actually,
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  I understand that when they say, Hey, do you want to allow location? I understand why they do that.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:02.520]  And it takes, it's just a tap. So I don't mind that that you say, yes, I want to allow location.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:14.280]  Yes, here's my, I, I cloud, username, password, yeah, that's not my problem. But given that
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:19.320]  they're already making you go through those steps, I don't find that to be a problem. My problem is
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:27.720]  with the fact that once you're past that, it takes so long and it's indeterminate for all of
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:32.440]  your stuff to come over. And you've got all these apps that are like darkened out because they're,
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:36.600]  it's like they're coming, but they're not there yet, but you don't see any progress.
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:41.880]  You mean when you restore it when you sign in and yeah, yeah, if you don't select setup is new.
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:47.960]  Right. I just don't see for the Apple Watch health stuff, I don't see why that isn't an
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:53.400]  option at that point too, where what do you want to do with your Apple Watch? Do you want to just
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:12:02.520]  keep it on the iPhone, which is more private, or would you allow us to store it in your iCloud account
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:06.360]  online, which that's all I'm saying. I just want an option.
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:13.800]  Right. And I don't see, it certainly is private. I mean, I don't want, you know, and I realize that
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:21.960]  there's some kind of bug in, you know, on Apple's server side stuff that someday somebody,
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:27.480]  there might be some kind of breach that would let that stuff out. And I wouldn't want that to happen.
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:33.000]  But to me, it's no more private than, in fact, I would, for me personally, I would consider it
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:40.760]  less private than my email, which I have a contact list or my contact list or my eye messages.
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:45.880]  I actually use iMessage more than I use my mac.com email. So the contents of my eye messages are
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:49.480]  far more. And I guess the whole iMessage is the core of my cloud.
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:56.200]  Right. Yeah. I miss it. My email is, if it was something I could opt into, I would, I trust Apple
[1:12:56.200 --> 1:13:02.280]  enough that I would trust it. But your email with Apple is on their servers, not others.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.640]  Right. But I, you know, they certainly host things. They do host things that are private.
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:13.000]  And I don't see why my Apple watch data, data can't be.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.760]  Yeah. I mean, I just wish, I mean, even if it was just like for the one-time sync,
[1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:25.960]  and then they deleted or something, I don't know. I don't know enough about that. But yes,
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:31.880]  that is the one annoying thing I did not get from the restore. And also iMessage history,
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:38.840]  you can get, you can sync all your old messages. Yeah. But other than that, I'm really happy with
[1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:45.640]  my setup as new iPhone, like the whole new world. It's like, it's, it's a tempting way,
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:48.600]  it's a tempting way to clean up all the apps you're not using too.
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:52.840]  Yeah. And it really makes you think about what the best apps you use. And like,
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:58.120]  I redid my home screen. And, right. This is all I use a lot of Google. But
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:02.120]  I have a lot of Google and social networks, basically.
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:06.120]  Right. Yes. It's Starbucks app.
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:10.680]  What paint? It's such a pain in the ass to set up.
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:15.880]  The Starbucks app. No, no, no. It has to set up a new device and have all of this apps.
[1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:21.480]  Yeah. I find it easier. I do it. See. And so, for example, with iPads, I never,
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:26.600]  I almost never restore from a backup. I just always start the iPad fresh. So like the iPad
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.600]  Pro that I've been using, you know, since whenever they've seated the review units,
[1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:34.760]  it's a lot easier to do than with an iPhone, because I don't feel like you're giving things up.
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:38.200]  You're not giving things up like your message hit. Well, I guess you aren't giving up
[1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.960]  somewhat of your message history, but I like the fact that you're main device for that.
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:51.400]  Exactly. And actually, I did the same for that pro. When I did the iPhone reviews,
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:57.240]  I have to think, no, you know, for the iPhone reviews, I didn't restore from backup.
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:02.600]  And then when I started using it as like my phone for a little bit, I did restore from a
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:07.640]  old backup, because I didn't want to test the battery life in my test with a, I just wanted to do it
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:15.560]  completely clean. But yeah, most of the time when I've gotten new phones, I do a restore.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:21.160]  And my wife has done a restore and her like, oh, and that's why I think it's also ridiculous.
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:26.440]  It's like, in some of those restore files, they have crazy things in there. The files can be like,
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:32.760]  I think her last one was like 60 or 70 gigs, because she had done the restore of,
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:36.360]  you know, you do the restore. It's all your photos that were stored on the phone, videos,
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.600]  everything, you know, even photos that were in your eye messages.
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:47.720]  Yeah. And sometimes those I had one point had one of her files on my computer and it was taking
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:53.640]  up a ton of space. Yeah, they can definitely get big, but that's 70 gigs, really big.
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:58.040]  Because they don't back up some of the stuff. They don't back up like your iTunes stuff,
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:03.400]  because they, you know, they can sing that. Right. They can sing it from the server.
[1:16:03.400 --> 1:16:07.000]  But that's part of the process, though, that I hate is that it's indeterminate when that's
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:11.240]  going to finish. There's nowhere to go where it shows you a progress bar that says, here's all
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:19.560]  the stuff that we are restoring. And here's what, what state it is. Right. I mean, for most
[1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:24.120]  people, a lot of this stuff should be in the cloud. Other than the apps, I mean, the apps are also
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:28.280]  in the cloud. You just have to manually go into iTunes and select which ones you want.
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:37.400]  That's what I did. I mean, into the app store. Yeah. I'm very happy with my decision to set up
[1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:43.560]  as a new iPhone. And I encourage all listeners to do the same. Yeah, it seems it's other than if
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:47.240]  you're going to be very upset about your Apple Watch data. Why do I keep calling it the eyewash?
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.760]  Should just call it the eyewash? Didn't be like that person that keeps calling it the eye touch.
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:57.720]  Tim Cook slipped and said I watch on one of the events this year. I forget which one, but might
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:03.320]  have been like at WWDC. But at some point earlier this year, Tim Cook slipped and almost got
[1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:07.640]  the word all the way out of his mouth before he correct himself. It makes you wonder, like,
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:14.120]  were they going to call it the eyewash at some point? Probably. Yeah, I suspect. I mean, obviously,
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:21.400]  we do it because that was like what it was rumored to be called for so long. Right. Yeah, I think
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:26.920]  what happened is that there was a, I think, well, who knows? Because this is one of the things
[1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:33.800]  where who knows who the people are. But clearly there's a contingent within the company that
[1:17:33.800 --> 1:17:42.360]  has one out that has decided that the whole eye prefix thing is day on. And maybe they were
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:48.280]  opposed to it all along who knows and that it was a Steve Jobs thing. Right. Like, you know,
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:53.480]  like one thing you know, this is one of the things we miss without Steve Jobs there is that when
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:18:00.200]  Steve was there, you knew with certain things like that that he must have liked it. Like, there's
[1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:06.680]  no possible way they would have used that eye prefix for the iMac, the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone,
[1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.240]  anything that had that eye prefix, you know that Steve liked it because if he didn't, there's
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:16.920]  no way they would have used it. Whereas who it is that's made them decide to get away from that,
[1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:23.640]  who knows? Is it Shiller? Is it Johnny Ives? Is it Shiller and Johnny Ives? Who knows? But somebody
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:28.520]  obviously doesn't like it anymore. But I think that there must have been some people who do like it
[1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:33.080]  and we're like, wait, that's what we're known for. People are already calling it the iWatch. We haven't
[1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:41.720]  even told them we're doing it yet. I think it's, I think people like it, it's just, I don't like
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:48.920]  that I keep saying it, but it's just like, that's what I call it. Yeah, it's like the iWatch. There was
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:54.840]  no iTouch. There's never been an iTouch. I see I never felt for that one. I never called it either.
[1:18:54.840 --> 1:18:57.480]  I mean, also it's like that sounds wrong. I always thought it sounded wrong.
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:03.720]  I even write it. I say it all the time, but it's gotten better over the years, but iPad is so
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:10.520]  close to iPod where I've had podcasts where I've been talking about the iPad and just said iPod
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:15.240]  like 10 times and whoever's on the show with me is like, you know, you keep saying iPod and
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:24.040]  I'm like, I do. It's just, it's just, it's filed under the same like cells in my brain. And they're
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:29.320]  like, like my brain says that close enough. It's a thing from Apple and the iPod pro.
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:31.320]  Yeah, the exactly.
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:38.920]  Yeah, this actually reminds me. So like yesterday, there's some internal email chain on our team.
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:44.520]  And oh, I know we got an email from VR company and they were basically like trying to take
[1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:49.160]  your music and make it into a VR visualization. And so it started talking about like, oh,
[1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:54.600]  remember those visualizations and iTunes, you know, the music visualizations. So turns out
[1:19:54.600 --> 1:20:02.520]  those are still there because everything is still in iTunes. And someone on our team went into
[1:20:02.520 --> 1:20:13.960]  iTunes and found the UI quilt or whatever the icons are, the dot r s dot r s r c files. I'm pulling
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:19.800]  this up right now. And you can see in there all the old, like, you know, it has support still for
[1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:28.760]  all of the old iPods. And it's amazing to look at a forward to this. It has like, you know, all
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:38.520]  the way back to it's got the original, it's got the original Apple TV in here, shuffles, iPod video,
[1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:42.280]  the U2 iPod. It's great.
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:44.520]  The U2 iPod.
[1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:47.160]  Remember that is great. U2 iPod.
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:49.640]  It was tremendous.
[1:20:49.640 --> 1:20:58.040]  Yeah. Yeah, just tons. I mean, my guess is that's because these are all still supported in iTunes.
[1:20:59.960 --> 1:21:01.880]  Yeah, the first Apple TV is amazing.
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:10.440]  That's really crazy. That's almost Microsoftian in terms of backwards compatibility.
[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.040]  I'll send you these. I think you should have access to it. Maybe you want to post them.
[1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:22.120]  Okay. Yeah, they're, and then they have like the little icons we were looking for. We were
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:28.200]  wondering if the little burn icon for burn to CD was still there. It's not, it's not there anymore.
[1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:35.400]  Wait, once the last time they sold a machine that could burn a CD, that's been a couple of years.
[1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:38.120]  You still can burn it though in iTunes.
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:41.320]  Right. You just have to have an external dock.
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:48.440]  Yeah. Right. All right. Before we go too far into the weeds on iTunes, let me take another break here
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:56.760]  and thank our next sponsor. And it's our good friends at MailRout. MailRout is a company.
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:22:02.280]  They do one thing and they do it well. They filter junk from email.
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:07.240]  They're just, these are email nerds who do nothing but email. This is great.
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:11.800]  They don't host your email. What they do is they provide it. The sounds weird. I know this
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:16.840]  sounds weird. They provide a service. If you have your own domain name or you host your email,
[1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:23.720]  you just change your DNS settings to point at MailRout first and your email goes through.
[1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:28.440]  It's like a very thin, it's like a screen. Think of it as like a sifting screen and they
[1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:35.640]  take all the spam and junk out and then forward all the good email, anything left after that
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:41.480]  goes to your existing mail server. So you already have a mail server and your domain name.
[1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:45.000]  You don't change your email server or your domain name. You don't have to set up new accounts
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.560]  on a new thing or whatever. All you do is change your DNS to point at MailRout first. The spam
[1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:56.600]  gets taken out and then your email just shows up. And the effect for you as a user of your email
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:01.080]  and for anybody else in your company or your team or uses your email, nothing changes. They don't have,
[1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:06.280]  you don't have to go into your mail clients and change, you know, anything on the user side.
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:10.920]  All you notice is that all of a sudden all the junk is gone and it's not in your inbox anymore.
[1:23:11.720 --> 1:23:17.400]  It is tremendous. I've used it. It is really remarkable in terms of how accurate it is.
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:25.080]  No spam filtering is perfect and they have really, really great features. Super easy where you can
[1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:32.360]  get like an automated message on a daily basis or a weekly basis that tells you, here's all the
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:36.680]  questionable stuff that we filtered out and you can just review that to look for any kind of false
[1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:43.400]  positives. Really easy to set up white listing. If there's one particular message that got hit,
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:49.080]  that you know you're going to get more from maybe like PayPal messages or something like that that
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:55.400]  often get flight to spam. You can just easily whitelist a certain address. Couldn't be easier.
[1:23:55.400 --> 1:24:01.080]  You just set it up once, change your DNS. All of a sudden spam and junk just go away.
[1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:08.440]  Could not be easier. They even have advanced features if you want them. They have an API,
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:15.640]  so you can program stuff. They support LDAP, Active Directory, TLS, mail bagging, whatever that is,
[1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:22.600]  outbound relay, anything you would want from the people handling your email. Great tech support,
[1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:34.840]  everything is just great. So here's what you do. Go to mailroute.net slash TTS, the talk show TTS,
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:40.040]  and when you go there, you'll start with a free trial, which is great. When you see how great the
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:45.800]  free trial is, once you start paying, you'll get 10% off for the lifetime of your account, not like
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:51.320]  one time only 10%. This is like for years to come, 10 years from now, when you're still using mailroute,
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:57.720]  you'll have saved like megabucks because you went to mailroute.net slash TTS. So go check them out if
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:06.680]  you host your own email. What else is on your mind Joanna? What else is on my mind?
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:17.080]  I really don't know what's on my mind right now. I was talking about using an iPad mini.
[1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:23.000]  If you could only take one iPad with you on a trip, which one would it be?
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:28.840]  Let's say you're going away on a week for a week, you're going to be away from home for a week.
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:38.360]  Well, I'm weird because I don't read on an iPad. Like, I don't read books on an iPad. So I have
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:45.160]  the Kindle paper white, which I love. So I would probably bring that pro and I would try to not bring
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:51.720]  my air. I mean, am I going on vacation? Where am I going? That's probably actually what's really
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:56.680]  on my mind. I'm going on vacation in a week and a half and I can't wait. All right, well, then there
[1:25:56.680 --> 1:26:05.640]  you go. So it's not even hypothetical. Yeah, I'm going to Cabo. I'm going to probably bring
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:15.720]  I'll bring the pro if I still have it and I haven't sent it back. I mean, I just don't think I
[1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:26.040]  would. Yeah, for watching Netflix and for, or like, watching any downloaded movies, we did that
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:33.160]  as well. I'm preferring it over the air that I bought two years ago.
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:38.120]  I still, I think I should sell that air probably, right?
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.880]  I should sell all of this stuff. I have so much stuff and I just keep it all and just hoard it here
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:51.800]  in my office and it's, you know, by the time. I mean, I don't sell, I did sell my iPhone 6. I did
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:56.600]  it for a story, but I pretty much would have, that's how I think I'm going to be doing going forward.
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:26:59.560]  I still haven't decided if I should go ahead and get into the upgrade program.
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:09.160]  Have you, is that, are you on that plan? No, I actually still own one of every iPhone
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:15.880]  ever made because I bought everyone for myself and I've kept them all. In fact, I'm more than one
[1:27:15.880 --> 1:27:21.160]  of everyone because I have some of Amy's as well. Some are Amy's. We've given away to like family
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:27.400]  members. I don't think we've ever sold one, but we've, you know, given them a way to people,
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:32.280]  you know, like her younger sister and stuff like that. And she had one that she broke.
[1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  I got it. So I'm kind of like, I'm thinking about doing this basically my own upgrade plan.
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:45.320]  Everyone else should be on the Joanna Stern upgrade plan where I basically buy the phone outright
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:56.440]  then hopefully sell it right before the event using old phone, use that new money to buy the new
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:06.440]  phone. And that's basically what I sold my six, my 64 gig, six right before the event for
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:14.360]  520 something dollars on Swapa. And it was a good experience. Way more money than you'd get on
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:19.560]  one of those other sites. I got completely scammed on eBay. So I didn't use eBay. You did get scammed
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:24.360]  on eBay? Oh, yeah. Totally scammed on eBay. Really? Tell me about that.
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:32.520]  Yeah. I like put it up for sale on eBay. The guy, of course, claiming to be from Nigeria.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.920]  Well, no, he didn't, he didn't tell me he was from Nigeria. So he's the guy who buys it,
[1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:46.360]  it says he lives in Boston and that he's buying the phone for $600. That's probably where I
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:51.240]  should have been tipped off because it was like more than I had put it up for. And so he then,
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:55.000]  this is actually hilarious because this was all for a story. I was basically just putting it up
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:01.800]  there to test out eBay for a story. And they say he says he's in Boston. I'm like, okay,
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:07.160]  he says, oh, I can't send the money through eBay. It's something's wrong with it. I need to send
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:14.680]  it through PayPal. Okay, that's fine. Then he says, oh, I can't send it through the right
[1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:19.720]  PayPal because eBay doesn't own PayPal anymore. It's like, that has absolutely nothing to do with
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:25.160]  anything. It is true. It's true. Yeah, it's true. But like, that doesn't have anything to do with
[1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:32.600]  any like whatever, whatever it is. And then ultimately sends me a fishing PayPal email that says
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:40.040]  he sent me the $600 through PayPal. And you know, there was no real transaction that happened
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:47.720]  through PayPal or through eBay. But you just, you didn't send him the phone now. No, no,
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:52.200]  and I don't think in the end, I don't think he was actually after the phone. I think he was
[1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:57.080]  after some sort of information that I would have either clicked on when I clicked on that PayPal
[1:29:57.080 --> 1:30:05.000]  fishing thing. Yeah. Yeah. And then like gave me a whole story like, oh, instead, send the phone to
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:13.400]  Nigeria because my cousin is there and gave me a whole story about that. But I was actually, I know,
[1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:18.120]  I could actually forward you the emails as I, let me see the PayPal.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:28.040]  The really, what actually ended up happening, which was really, I was very upset about from eBay,
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:35.480]  was he had gotten my phone number. Yeah. And that was where I, you know, the scam stuff happens and
[1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:42.600]  you need to be on the lookout for weird PayPal spoofing email addresses. Yeah, his name is Stanley
[1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:52.920]  Bates and, you know, Stan Lee Bates from Boston. And I knew obviously that something was really
[1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:58.280]  fishy when he wanted to send it through this weird PayPal looking thing in my, you know, it looks
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:06.440]  pretty real, to be honest. But the address says, um, sale safety at usa.com. Right. Anyway, what,
[1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:11.320]  what, what I was really annoyed about was eBay has this loophole where after you've finished
[1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:17.160]  a transaction with someone and bought something and said you're going to buy this item or whatever
[1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:22.760]  and have the account, there is a way using your listing number that you can look up their phone
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:31.240]  number and their email address. So he had been, he texted me. Yeah. Yeah. I was really
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:36.920]  sad. Happy about that. But in the end, I sold my iPhone six. And then I used that money to buy a
[1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:42.360]  new iPhone six as this past weekend. And so you, who did you sell it to Swappa? How do you spell that?
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:50.120]  Yes, swapa.com. S W A P P A. Hmm. Yeah, this was all first story. It was right, right before
[1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:55.640]  the iPhone event. I wrote a piece about the best ways to sell your phone. Right. But it, it,
[1:31:56.600 --> 1:32:02.360]  I mean, obviously introducing a middleman definitely, you know, they're, they're in business.
[1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:08.280]  So you're selling to them for less than what they're going to resell it for. And then theory,
[1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:13.240]  if you could sell, this is like the whole spirit of eBay. In theory, if you could just find the
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:17.320]  person who wanted to buy it, you could sell it to them for some price in between and make money.
[1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:24.200]  Yeah. I'll send you the article that, swapa is, is a marketplace, an open marketplace. So you are
[1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:31.720]  selling to another person. Oh, really? Yeah. So exactly the middleman options like gazelle or you,
[1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:38.680]  you sell or, um, what are the many other ones? Next worth or I cracked, they won't give you as good
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:45.480]  of a value as an eBay or an Amazon marketplace or swapa. Hmm. Yeah, I'm not familiar with that
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:50.040]  because I just hoard all of mine. Right. Like an, like an idiot. Oh, I had a great experience with
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:54.440]  swapa. Actually, it was, I had said on the listing that I would prefer it with someone in New York
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:33:01.320]  City and found a guy and we met in a very public place in, in New York and he bought the phone,
[1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:08.920]  right, right there. That legit guy, not Stanley Bates from Africa. And so if you met in person,
[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:14.040]  how does, was the transaction still digital though, where like he, he sent the money on PayPal
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:20.760]  before legit. I saw it, I saw it clear in my PayPal account. Right. Yeah. That sounds great.
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:27.000]  Yeah. I mean, you know, and like, that's what this year, you know, and I think back on like,
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:32.920]  what were some of the big themes of the year, you know, in smartphones. I just did this
[1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:38.760]  buying guide and it was like, all phones became great. You know, most of these Android phones are great
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:46.040]  now. Um, you know, the iPhone became even better. And the biggest deal was like how we buy our
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:52.760]  phones through carriers now, right, carriers decided, uh, screw, screw these contracts,
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:59.320]  um, whether people really start upgrading their phones more frequently, I'm not so sure. It's still
[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:06.200]  not the easiest thing, you know, to navigate those deals. Certainly Apple's program is, is,
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:14.360]  seems like the best of them all. Um, but yeah, I mean, how we buy and, and, and pay the carriers was
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:25.320]  certainly a big change of, of 2015. Um, I'm, I'm, I'm still with Verizon because I still think
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:31.640]  I get the best service with them, but I'm happy to say I won't be in a contract with them soon.
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:37.320]  Yeah, I'm out of, I've not been in a contract with them for a while. That was the decision. I made
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:44.200]  this decision like a year, was it a year ago or two years ago, I forget when, but, um, no,
[1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:50.200]  I think it was a year ago, uh, but we stopped doing buying phones on contract, even when our,
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:56.280]  we had the off option to do it and just pay the whole price and we will pay you, you know,
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.640]  we have a family plan with Verizon. We'll just pay that and just keep it all on the up and up
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:07.880]  and pay upfront. Right. I'm still in the, because I've made a family plan and we signed it about,
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:14.520]  we signed it when the six, when the six came out. So, um, I'm still stuck in that contract. Yeah,
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:19.720]  which then hopefully, you know, we can go to the, these new bucket data plans and
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:28.840]  be better. Do you get, do you get good Verizon signal, uh, at the journal's office?
[1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:36.280]  Yeah, I get pretty good signal for all in the office here when I'm on the sixth floor.
[1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:43.400]  When I'm in New York, I find that it is a block by block crapshoot as to whether I have
[1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:48.440]  cell signal and this is with my Verizon phone and didn't, that didn't used to be the case. Maybe
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:53.400]  it's just the places in midtown where I tend to be, I don't know, but it's, it's not necessarily
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:36:00.440]  bad. Like, like the way that AT&T's used to be horrendous in New York. I mean, like truly unusable,
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:06.280]  like can't believe, can't believe this, um, anybody even gets by with this service. Uh, which I
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:10.680]  don't think is true anymore, but it's not like that, but it's definitely not like it is for me here
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:15.640]  in Philadelphia and Philadelphia. I get pretty strong signal almost everywhere. Yeah, I mean,
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:22.440]  the thing I've noticed about Verizon is maybe I don't have as many bars everywhere, like as many
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:28.200]  bars that probably have with AT&T, but I get like better service and pockets where there usually
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:32.840]  isn't service. So like in the elevator, I always get service and by building with Verizon, it always
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:40.040]  drops with AT&T. And, um, also on the subways here on my subway route to work, I have Verizon service
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:46.040]  and not always AT&T. Oh, see, that's different here in Philly. And Philly, I think AT&T like
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:52.600]  bribed somebody and has like exclusive cell service in the subway. Oh, really? So yeah, they even
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:58.120]  have like the, the, the subway, I don't know how, I never even heard of such a thing, but, uh,
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.840]  in Philadelphia, the sports complexes, you know, like where you'd go see the
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:07.160]  fillies or the Eagles or the sixers and flyers, they're all right next to each other,
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:12.440]  they're all, and it's way down in South Philly at the end of the, the line, like you can't go,
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:18.040]  you just ride the subway south and right at the last stop you get out. And that subway station
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:24.280]  is named like AT&T station. So like, yeah, but I think that part of the deal with that.
[1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:28.440]  Not the same in, where the, where the Giants play in San Francisco, what's the name of that,
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:35.000]  uh, stadium Levi's stadium. I don't know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that, that's the 49ers,
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:43.720]  the Giants play at AT&T Park. Yeah. Yeah, I went with the same there. Yeah, I wonder if they have like
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:51.320]  exclusive cell towers in the stadium. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, we're, we're going to
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:57.240]  deal with the 5G, the competition for 5G next. So, when do you think that's coming?
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:03.240]  I don't think so. I don't pay attention to stuff like that. I thought they've been saying 2016,
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:14.600]  some of the tests are going to happen. I think Verizon's been saying tests happening in, in 2016.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:21.560]  Oh, God. Yeah, you know, these things happen in waves. It's going to be, it'll be another
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:30.440]  fun year of more stuff that is promised the next year. Let me take one break before we wrap up
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:36.040]  the show and I have one more sponsor to thank. It is our good friends at Backblaze. Backblaze
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:43.640]  does online backup for your Mac or your PC. But let's face it, most people listen in here
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:49.880]  are probably going to take the Mac version. But if you have a PC, you could definitely get back
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:59.320]  place for it. You install their software. You get a free trial. All everything on your Mac just
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:04.040]  backs up to their cloud-based servers. Everything. You have an external drive, but that backs up too.
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:09.240]  There's no limit. You say, well, I have a three terabyte drive. It'll back up the whole thing.
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:15.480]  Might take longer. It will take longer because that's, you know, there's no way to make three terabytes
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:21.640]  upload quicker. But it'll happen eventually. And once it's there, everything else is incremental.
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:26.280]  And then you don't notice it. You don't have to click a button. You don't have to go in there
[1:39:26.280 --> 1:39:31.320]  and set up a schedule for when the backup happens. Backblaze just runs automatically in the
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:39.880]  background silently. And as files change on your Mac, it just keeps it in sync with what's online.
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:44.440]  Then what can you do after that when it's backed up? Well, if catastrophe strikes, if, you know,
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:51.480]  here's computer breaks, if somebody steals your computer, you can go to backblaze and you can order,
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:57.400]  for example, everything restored onto a USB drive and they will mail it to you. You could just
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:04.200]  download everything if you want to. Or what happens in 25% of all of their restores from customers
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:09.800]  work this way. You can just restore one file at a time. So you can just log in from any computer
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:16.440]  anywhere. Log into your backblaze account. Browse your entire Mac, all of your files, and download
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:21.480]  one file. If you just like, find yourself in a situation where you know you have a file at home
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:26.520]  or on your office Mac, but you're not there right now and you don't have it with you. You can get it.
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:31.640]  They've got Android app. They've got an iPhone app. So you can use these apps to access your account
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:38.280]  and get anything from your system anywhere you are anywhere in the world. How much does this cost?
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:43.240]  It costs $100 a month. It sounds like it should. No, it doesn't cost $100 a month. It costs
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:51.000]  $5 a month. $5. And you just have unlimited, unthrottle backup. And I'm telling it, you sleep
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:57.400]  so much easier knowing that everything on your Mac is backed up somewhere outside of your desk
[1:40:57.400 --> 1:41:04.520]  that it's just out there. So great. Go to backblaze.com slash the talk show and they'll know
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:10.040]  you came from the show and you get a no risk, risk-free, no credit card required trial. Just go
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:18.200]  there and check it out backblades.com slash the talk show. You see that the Zuckerberg's
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:25.480]  announced that they're going to give away 99% of their fortune. I did. I was actually just looking
[1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:29.320]  at that article just because the baby picture. I was really just looking at the baby picture.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:38.520]  They announced it coinciding with the birth of their first child. It's a daughter. It is an adorable
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:44.840]  picture. I'm a sucker for babies. I know me too. And I like the name too. Max for a girl.
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:53.480]  Yeah. Yeah. And so they've announced in a letter to their daughter that they will be giving away
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:42:00.040]  99% of their fortune, which is very noble. I know like the gates, the gates is I think have
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:05.960]  pledged to give away 95% of their fortune. And I know that the Gates Foundation already has like
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:11.480]  41 billion dollars. They've already given an enormous amount of money to fund their foundation.
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:17.800]  Because he's saying over his lifetime. Yeah. And I think at the start, he's saying he's going to
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:27.880]  give up to or donate up to a billion dollars in stock a year for the next three years. And I guess
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:32.920]  part of that, again, to cycle back to Wealthfront, you know, that some of this stuff is like SEC mandated
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:36.760]  that if you're going to say, if you're going to talk about stuff like this with a publicly
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:46.120]  traded company, you've got to announce it in advance. But I think it's something that, again,
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:52.440]  another little bit of a theme of the year, so nostalgic for the year. I think I just want the year
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:59.800]  to be over so I can go on vacation. But it's a socially conscious move by Zuckerberg, obviously,
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:04.440]  and a really important one. But it's also like you feel like that's a little bit of a change
[1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:10.120]  that's been happening in Silicon Valley. And especially, you know, at Tim Cook's Apple more and more
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:15.560]  of the way he's you're laughing. I am laughing because I have a point to make here. But keep going.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:23.000]  But you know, it's a change, right? I mean, like, and I feel like also like coming out of,
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:28.680]  you know, Tim Cook's socially conscious Apple, where, you know, when he spoke at our conference in
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:36.120]  October, he spent a lot of time talking about how, you know, it's Apple's job to make the world
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:39.480]  a better place, which is like, obviously, Apple's always thought about that as a fight through
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:46.440]  technology. But you got also the sense like he wants to do that, even just in his position of
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:52.920]  power as the CEO of one of the most powerful companies in the world, if not the most powerful
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:59.800]  richest company in the world. You know, his message there was really impactful, I thought.
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:09.320]  I find Tim Cook to be an incredibly sincere person. And I actually think when you listen to him,
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:13.560]  especially when you really don't just read the transcript, but if you can actually see him talk
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:21.400]  on video or like you said at a conference and he just hear him talk, there is a sincerity in his
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:27.320]  voice when he talks about things like that. And I know he said it many times that in his office,
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:35.160]  he's got portraits of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy. And when he talks about that,
[1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:39.320]  and he said it many times. And if you just read it, you might think that that's just the thing
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:44:47.320]  that he wants to say. Right. But when you hear him talk about that, he gets choked up in a way.
[1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:52.440]  And when he talks about Apple's products, he doesn't sound as sincere. And I don't mean that he
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:57.960]  doesn't mean it. But he actually is less fired up and emotional when he's talking about, say,
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:03.960]  you know, how he traveled to Europe a couple weeks ago using with just his iPad pro and his iPhone
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:08.760]  as his only devices. And I think he did. I really think he's the type of person where he really,
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:12.680]  he wouldn't lie about that. He wouldn't say that if it weren't true. If he secretly had a,
[1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:17.400]  you know, a MacBook pro in his hotel room, he wouldn't say it. I really think that's true. But,
[1:45:17.400 --> 1:45:23.480]  you know, there's a certain rehearsed tone to his voice when he's talking about their products like
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:29.880]  that. And when he talks about the social stuff, he could see his blood start to boil a little.
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:35.960]  No, I totally, and actually, like, I actually just pulled up our live blog from the conference. And
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:40.680]  we, I didn't summarize a lot, but I said, you know, his, he sounds, it doesn't only sound like
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.760]  marketing speak when he is up there. He truly wants to make a push for human rights and making the
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:50.840]  world a better place. And I can't remember specifically the points he made. I, you know,
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:57.480]  but yes, I totally agree with you. The way I came, I came out of that,
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:03.800]  that interview where he was grilled on everything from the car to the iPad, to the Apple TV,
[1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:11.000]  and how he's going to, you know, put down the cable companies, just thinking, okay, this guy wants
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:16.600]  to mostly, though, make the world a better place and use Apple as, you know, as his technology
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:22.840]  company to help do that. So yeah, I think just like, you know, it's cheesy, but it does feel a little
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:29.880]  bit of a different vibe, I don't know. He's always had this reputation. And before he really became,
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:35.160]  you know, certainly, you know, when he became CEO, he obviously became the much, much more public.
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:41.640]  And but he spoke on stage a few times before that. But he was, you know, a lot more of a mystery
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:48.200]  before he took over a CEO. And, but he had a reputation as being fearsome, a fearsome negotiator,
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:52.040]  the sort of person who in a meeting, you know, even if it's just within the company that,
[1:46:52.040 --> 1:46:55.800]  you know, you better be prepared when you show up for a meeting with him or he's going to hand you
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:03.240]  your hat, you know, you don't see that when he's on stage talking about Apple's products. When he's
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:08.280]  talking about the products, he's very, very genial. There is this, you know, this very friendly,
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:14.520]  quarterly Southern demeanor that comes out. And it's funny because when he talks about these
[1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:21.960]  social issues, which is a much more, you know, it's, it's, it by the actual topic is humane.
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:31.080]  I sense, I, that's when I consent that the fearsome person that he can be. It's like,
[1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:34.120]  it is frustrations with these social issues around the world,
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:39.080]  boil to the surface and he can't hide it. It doesn't come across as genial at all. It comes
[1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:42.280]  across as, wow, I can see why people are scared of this guy.
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.400]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think, and it was a year ago, I mean, it was, it was actually a year ago
[1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:54.920]  right after our conference that he had come out, you know, and that, that letter, you know,
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:59.880]  which truly had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he was the CEO of Apple. I mean,
[1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:05.800]  it did. It had a lot about, of course, it had, you know, to do with who he was, but, you know,
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:16.520]  that letter was just so well written and so heartfelt. And that's a, you got a vision of who he was,
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:24.600]  and, you know, after many people thought, or as many people try to still explain who jobs was,
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:30.120]  this guy's just doing it. He's just, he's, he's putting it all out there.
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:40.040]  So like you say that there's this sort of a social, I don't know how best to put it, but there's
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:48.680]  a change in the, at the very top of the Silicon Valley industry to be socially minded with and
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:52.520]  end up, you know, put your money where your mouth is and actually do things like pledge 99% of
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:57.880]  your fortune to these causes. I made me laugh when I laughed a couple minutes ago,
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:49:06.120]  because I was thinking that the old way is like the Larry Ellison way, just to buy an island
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:13.880]  and why like a James Bond villain. Right. This is all mine. Right. And also I have a sailboat.
[1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:20.360]  Right. I've pledged my, I've pledged my fortune to America's cups. You know, right.
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:27.240]  $500 million, you know, racing yacht, which I would be watching my yacht and you can look at it.
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:35.240]  Well, this is my, this is my racing yacht, which I, which I observe from my, you know, yacht yacht.
[1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:44.360]  Right. You can peek at my yacht through your small little phone screen, but I peek at my many
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:51.800]  odds through my major window above 10 other yachts. So the other thing that made me laugh, though, is
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:57.720]  when I saw that that, uh, that the Zuckerberg's were pledging to give away 99% of their fortune,
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:05.880]  I thought, A, I thought, I would I do that if I were in his position, if I had, uh, somehow,
[1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:11.960]  if, if, you know, if Daring Fireball were worth as much as Zuckerberg's stake in Facebook,
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:18.920]  would I be willing to pledge to give 99% of it away? I would like to think that I would, uh,
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:23.480]  I'm not sure that I would. I feel like you'd nobody would, nobody can really say what they would do
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:26.360]  unless they were actually in that position to do it. I don't know that I would.
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:32.920]  But then my second thought turned to what if I was young Max. And my father had this fortune.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:40.120]  How would I feel about, about pledging to give it all away before I was even old enough to maybe
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:46.840]  make a counter argument? Like, why couldn't you have waited until I was even just a teenager?
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:51.800]  And I could maybe articulate an argument that maybe we should dial that number back a bit.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:58.280]  Yeah, in 15 years when Max is looking at this Facebook post through his holographic VR
[1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:07.640]  Oculus headset that Zuckerberg has also made another 98 billion dollars off of. He'll be like,
[1:51:07.640 --> 1:51:10.200]  Dad, I'm going to need that money.
[1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:17.720]  Or she like, yeah, I'm sorry. I keep referring it to, yeah, I'd love the name Max for a girl,
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:24.760]  but it's hard. It's a good name for it. It's a great name. But I really do feel like if my parents
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:29.080]  had that sort of fortune, I really would have wished that they would have waited until
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:35.480]  I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying maybe here on my side of it before we decide what
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:42.360]  percentage of the fortune to give away. I'm sure she will have plenty, plenty of money.
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:52.280]  Right. I totally realized that when you're talking about truly outsized fortunes,
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:58.120]  like Zuckerberg's stake in Facebook and Gates, you know, what Gates owned, it still owns in
[1:51:58.120 --> 1:52:05.800]  Microsoft, that 1% is truly still a monumental fortune. I'm just saying it may not be by your own
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:12.600]  island in Hawaii, you know, from Larry Ellison's fortune, which I really do kind of see the appeal of.
[1:52:14.760 --> 1:52:17.960]  Well, I mean, they live in, I think they live in Palo Alto.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:22.760]  God knows, we don't know what will happen to the property value there.
[1:52:23.320 --> 1:52:27.160]  Right. You might need my time. We just don't know. Actually, we do know.
[1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:34.680]  By the time Max Zuckerberg is an adult, she might need a billion or two dollars to buy a,
[1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:37.160]  you know, a regular sized house in Palo Alto.
[1:52:37.160 --> 1:52:42.600]  And they probably, probably just a small little portion of a yard in Palo Alto.
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:47.880]  I don't know enough about, well, I do know enough about what's been going on in the
[1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:55.720]  San Francisco Valley real estate market. But, yeah, I mean, certainly, I know there's been a lot
[1:52:55.720 --> 1:53:03.000]  of scrutiny about the way he set it up. It's an LLC versus it being actually a charitable organization
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:07.960]  or I don't know. I know there's been scrutiny today, but I've just kind of just thought it was
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:09.720]  great news yesterday.
[1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:12.760]  Wait, what was the, oh, the Zuckerberg news?
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:16.840]  Yeah, the Zuckerberg news. You know, you know, how our industry works.
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:18.600]  All right.
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:21.320]  And I'm actually, you know, I'm not on that side of the industry where I cover
[1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:27.080]  at really any of that, frankly. So I just read the articles and move on.
[1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:29.880]  Yeah, same here. And then I make jokes.
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:38.680]  Right. About the one last thing that is in the news is before we sign off is that
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:45.960]  there's so much news about so much speculation. It seems like it's going to happen that Yahoo is going
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:55.320]  to spin off and sell off a bunch of its units. And I can't help but think that's a good thing.
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:54:00.040]  But it really makes me think it's just big picture. What is Yahoo?
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:06.840]  Like, I don't, you know what I mean? Like, and now it's so easy to compare it with Google or AKA
[1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:11.880]  Alphabet, which I still find difficult to wrap my head around. And I realize that that's not one thing.
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:19.720]  But I still, I kind of get the company like I get it what what alphabet I'm going to call
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:25.240]  Google the hell with it. But I get what Google does. I get that they have this amazing search engine,
[1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:31.160]  which to me is still arguably. It might be the greatest invention in the history of the industry
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:35.160]  is Google web search. And I know that I give Google a lot of crap on Daring Fireball a lot of
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:40.520]  the time and people think I'm sort of, you know, because I tend to like Apple stuff and I tend to
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:47.000]  be a little bit more cynical about Google stuff. When I just look at the broad picture of everything
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.280]  that we have at our fingertips today, like if you could go, you know, if Ben Franklin time traveled
[1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:56.040]  and came here today, what was the, what's the first thing you would show him? I might show him Google
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:55:00.840]  like that there's this box where you can just type whatever you want into. And, you know,
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:05.560]  maybe I have to explain typing to him first, but I think he'd get it. But that you can just
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:09.000]  print his. I think you'd have to explain the computer first. Right.
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:15.960]  But, but once you got this, that's so amazing to think about. But it is, it's truly, you know, from
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:21.320]  our childhoods, it's truly still a piece of science fiction that we have that we, you could just type
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:27.960]  natural language questions to and get the answer. It's truly amazing. I get that they have this and
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:33.240]  that they make money from it with the ads that they show on it and that it billions of people around
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:39.000]  the world using it. So therefore tons of money. And I get their moonshots in terms of, you know,
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.520]  that they're banking on things that might become huge. Like if they have a self-driving car platform
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:52.280]  that can be to cars, what Android is to phones, that's that's a tremendous. I get it. I don't get
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:57.480]  Yahoo. Like I don't get what I don't know. Why do people go to Yahoo anymore? I don't get it.
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:04.120]  I don't think they do. I mean, I know they do, but like they do because they're older and they
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:11.080]  know it or it's already preloaded on their computers. That's why, right? I don't know. Are there
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:16.600]  other reasons? I don't know. I don't know. Like their email was there from many, many years ago.
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:22.280]  I mean, that's like why people still go to AOL. Right. Like the side of that, that you and I don't
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:27.320]  don't do. You're a product person. You write, you know, from the, hey, how do you, you know,
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:32.680]  you want to, what do you want to get? I'm a product person. I write about how do you use this stuff.
[1:56:32.680 --> 1:56:38.760]  I mean, I review services. I mean, I do tons of services stuff and I can't remember the last time
[1:56:38.760 --> 1:56:43.960]  I've recommended a Yahoo service. Well, that's what I wanted to do. And I've looked at them. I mean,
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.680]  even I gave Flickr a very, I mean, Flickr still has some great things. I gave it a really fair
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:52.920]  shake in the, in the photo comparisons earlier this year when it, you know, Google Photos and Apple
[1:56:52.920 --> 1:56:58.840]  Photos and it wasn't as good. Yeah. And I mean, it's like, it also people don't think about that
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.440]  anymore when they think Yahoo. They don't think about the services on their phone.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:09.240]  It's covered as a business story, right? It's the business reporters talking about this and,
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:15.560]  you know, Wall Street pressure on it and, you know, Kara Swisher has tremendous sources,
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:19.880]  you know, Yahoo. And it's the intrigue and speculation as to how much support does
[1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:24.680]  Marissa Meyer still have from the board and that sort of thing. But looking at it from like,
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:31.240]  my perspective is like, just what's cool and what is good to use and what would I recommend
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:35.560]  to people who, you know, follow me and look to me for advice or something like that,
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:40.040]  or what would be interesting for me to write about because it's, it's such a cool thing.
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:43.240]  I can't remember the last time that anything that Yahoo was involved with,
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:48.200]  even hit my, whatever parts of my brain light up when I see something cool.
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:56.360]  Yeah. Flickr, I guess the last time when I, I mean, was it Yahoo's not powering the weather anymore
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:58:03.160]  on the weather app? No, no, I don't think so. I think they switched to the weather channel,
[1:58:03.720 --> 1:58:09.000]  yeah, because they got, I think I had better worldwide service or something.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:17.320]  Yeah, I would have been the only Yahoo service I probably used every day since whatever,
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:22.200]  you know, since using Yahoo as a search engine 15 years ago.
[1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:31.640]  Oh, the iOS stocks app still is based on Yahoo data. Okay. I mean, so that's something.
[1:58:36.200 --> 1:58:45.080]  It was really like, um, Yahoo just picks up my videos. Yeah, who I get a lot of video views on
[1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:55.480]  Yahoo. So thank you for that Yahoo. I just, I don't get it. And I feel like, I feel like, and again,
[1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:59.640]  maybe it's just my me being obsessed with my perspective on things, but, uh,
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:07.800]  I just feel like all of this business side speculation on what Yahoo should do or whatever is
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:11.960]  got it all backwards and that it really has to start with products. And that's, if there's
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:17.880]  anything I'm disappointed in Marissa Meyer for is I really kind of had hoped that from what I knew
[1:59:17.880 --> 1:59:22.920]  of her beforehand that she was, you know, product focused. And I really thought that she would
[1:59:22.920 --> 1:59:29.560]  bring that to Yahoo, but it, I just, I think she did. I think she really, I mean, if you think about
[1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:34.440]  when some of the big attention that she had gotten when she first started was a flicker,
[1:59:34.440 --> 1:59:41.800]  a big flicker redesign, she was, she spoke at that. I remember I interviewed her after they
[1:59:41.800 --> 1:59:48.440]  knew flicker redesign. And she introduced it. And that was like a couple months after she took over.
[1:59:48.440 --> 1:59:54.520]  And then there was a new email thing. She was involved in that. I remember that. And then I don't
[1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:59.960]  remember anything else. Yeah. Or at least she tried to it first, but it's like, as the years have
[1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:04.440]  gone on, it just doesn't seem like that's happened. I don't know if I can share the story. Actually,
[2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:09.400]  this is funny. I'm going to share it. I got an email. I always have this podcast. I'm like,
[2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:12.840]  I feel, I mean, this is what's amazing about your podcast feels like just talking to you. And you
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:17.480]  really don't like think about that hundreds of how you probably have thousands and thousands of
[2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:22.920]  viewers that are listeners. I mean, I know you're. I think I haven't looked in a while. I probably
[2:00:22.920 --> 2:00:28.840]  should. I think it's a lot of them 70 to 80,000. Listen to me. Yeah, that's crazy. But like, yeah,
[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:36.360]  says the, says the woman who, wait, says the woman who writes for a newspaper with a circulation of
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:41.240]  what? I mean, the journals. Yeah, I was going to say the journal. The last I checked that's like a
[2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:47.560]  daily circulation of three million. Oh, this just feels like, you know, we're more intimate here.
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:55.960]  They cut all my words. But the, sorry, got an email. I had someone who used to work for me,
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:01:02.440]  and they were applying for a job at Yahoo. And they sent, you know, they want me to give some feedback
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:08.200]  and, you know, reference stuff. And in the email, it said, Marissa Mayer is going to be looking over
[2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:17.000]  this. And I thought to myself, that is really sad. Like, why is Marissa Mayer looking over a tech
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:23.240]  reporting position here? And I don't have anything. I mean, I had a lot of nice things to say about
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:28.440]  this person who used to work with me. But I just thought I wrote something like really
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:34.760]  sarcastic back to the recruiter too. And I wonder, I wonder if Marissa Mayer ever did read my review
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:41.000]  of that single tech review where they were going to hire. I don't know. Not a very interesting
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:45.960]  story. I don't know if I should have shared the story. Yeah, that's fine. But she definitely has
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:53.480]  a reputation as a micromanager. Right. You know, that's such an overused term. But as somebody who
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:02:03.640]  would do something like that and get involved in the, you know, wanting to approve. I've heard
[2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:09.000]  that story before. I have heard that that Yahoo that she wanted approval over, I don't know,
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:13.080]  almost everybody who got hired anywhere, that at some point. And it became like a gating factor.
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:17.720]  Because obviously, you know, she's busy. And you want to hire somebody for a certain team and
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:23.320]  all of a sudden it's almost like what developers go through with like the app store where like
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:27.480]  your app, you just want to fix a bug. Like you just want to hire somebody to do this. And then
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:32.760]  in the meantime, it's like a seven day wait before it percolates to the top of her, you know, inbox.
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:42.120]  And she can look at it. Yeah, I mean, I know there was a big, she had a big focus on the new Yahoo
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:49.400]  news. That was another big product launch that that she was very involved in. And that's actually
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:53.240]  a huge part of their operation. And actually, this is really how I think of them when I think about
[2:02:53.240 --> 2:02:56.600]  it. Because I know a number of people in the media industry have gone to work for them.
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:03:01.720]  A lot of anchors, a lot of on, on, on air talent from TV networks have gone to work for them.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:08.920]  David Pogue. David Pogue, of course. And they've built a good team over there.
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:17.560]  Yeah, I guess that is. I don't think, but that's not enough. Yeah, it's not enough to make them as
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:25.000]  big as they are. Right. Or to be as in, in the, in the ring with Google and Apple and Facebook.
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:35.000]  Right. And Microsoft. Yeah, I totally agree. But yet somehow it feels to me like like there's a
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:42.360]  potential there that they could be. Yeah. But I don't see it. But that's, you know, like again,
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:47.960]  like not, you know, when you think about, when I think about what's been going on with the big
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:56.280]  players in tech and products, Apple, Google, Microsoft, I don't really consider Facebook, Facebook's
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:04:00.040]  in there, obviously. And then the, you know, other big companies. But you know, when you think about
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:07.400]  the year, a lot of it was a, you know, there wasn't necessarily anything majorly new,
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:14.040]  you know, everyone's trying to compete to do a lot of the same things who can do it better,
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:19.320]  who can also do it more securely and more private, give us more privacy. That was a big,
[2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:23.320]  you know, source of the competition this year. I certainly Apple wanted to play to that.
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:29.800]  But, you know, when you think about where the real innovation or developments happened this year,
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:35.720]  it wasn't, it wasn't that kind of year. And what are, what is, what is going to be that sort of
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:43.400]  future for some of these companies? Yeah, the RVR is going to be an interesting one.
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:51.320]  Yeah, I, this was the year of, uh, watches becoming like a real thing.
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.840]  Everybody is, but even then, was it a huge thing?
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:05:01.560]  I don't think so. Not yet. But yeah, it's, you know, but it's obviously that's like a real
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:07.480]  thing that they're racing to do. And the next, I think VR is definitely the next big thing
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:13.240]  because I think the technology is very close. And there's, unlike cars, there aren't
[2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:19.000]  regulatory and legal hurdles to be passed in the cars thing. Everybody is working on,
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:25.640]  but it's so complicated and requires laws to be rewritten and, you know, just so much,
[2:05:26.280 --> 2:05:31.640]  so much stuff that's going to have to happen in public that it's years out. The VR thing is probably
[2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:37.960]  probably like a next year thing. Right. Yeah, I mean, like, it was such a year of refinement.
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:42.280]  And it's not a bad thing. Like, I don't, I don't want to whine about it. Like, I don't know,
[2:05:42.280 --> 2:05:46.840]  like nothing happened. This, you know, it was such a great year for products becoming
[2:05:46.840 --> 2:05:53.160]  that were already good becoming great. You know, I look at the iPhone. Like, it was already
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:57.960]  such a near perfect phone. I think it could still be a little bit more perfect as I wrote
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:02.760]  my review. But, you know, this is the device and our smartphones are the things that power so
[2:06:02.760 --> 2:06:09.720]  many of the other parts of our lives now. Like, they're just great. Yeah. You know, and that's
[2:06:09.720 --> 2:06:16.440]  what's happening with computing too, right? Like, we want our computers and our laptops
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:20.680]  or tablets to be even better and more like some of the mobile devices we've had.
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:27.160]  And we want our mobile devices to be more like PCs. Right. So it's just like a year of
[2:06:27.800 --> 2:06:33.400]  more refinement, I think. And again, I don't want it to happen. No, and I think that the fact that
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:43.720]  it's sort of like a refinement and it's created this, the thing that we talked about earlier,
[2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:52.360]  which is that it's made it harder to decide what to buy. Yeah. Because now that you can buy
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:57.880]  something like the iPad Pro, which really can be more of a laptop. But now that you can buy a laptop
[2:06:57.880 --> 2:07:05.640]  like the regular MacBook that says thin and light as an iPad or something like the Surface devices,
[2:07:07.240 --> 2:07:12.600]  it just blurs the line. And the fact that, you know, different things are way better on a giant
[2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:19.720]  sized iPad Pro, but other things are still better on an iPad mini. But it really doesn't make
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:25.240]  sense to tell somebody, well, you should buy three iPads. It's, I think you should
[2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:32.840]  visit the John Gruber life by three iPads. Right. Live with three iPads and a small iPhone,
[2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:36.520]  one in every pocket and one in every compartment of your, of your backpack.
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:42.600]  Okay. My last question to you, because I didn't ask you. Okay. What, what are you?
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:47.640]  Okay. Yeah. I'm going to ask about the iPhone then, because I think most excited about in,
[2:07:47.640 --> 2:07:57.080]  in 2016 for the iPhone. What am I as excited about? Or what am I hoping for?
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:00.280]  Yeah. I think what are you hoping for for the iPhone? I wasn't saying general for the next year,
[2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:02.360]  but I specifically want to ask you about the iPhone.
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:09.560]  You know, it's interesting. I know that there's rumors that are already out, like there's one
[2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:16.280]  last week about the, no, no headphone jack, which it's, you know, it's weird if it's comes true
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:19.640]  and it'll be a minor headache. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal.
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:23.640]  I find it interesting that there doesn't seem to be any specific rumors about what's coming yet.
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:35.720]  Yeah. I guess my biggest hope is that it's a truly revolutionary upgrade on the camera that it
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:43.560]  really takes a step towards being able to stand toe to toe with like an SLR type camera,
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:47.000]  not just point and shoot. It's like, I feel like point and shoots have been taken out.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:54.280]  Oh, yeah. And now it's, you know, what can take like the, you know, what can take, can we get
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:59.480]  us an iPhone that that stands up to like a thousand dollar standalone camera in terms of image
[2:08:59.480 --> 2:09:05.720]  quality and depth of field and stuff like that. And so something like that. And I heard a while
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:11.160]  back that, you know, and I know Apple bought this some company or there's a patent that's out there
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:16.520]  or something, but these ideas of use and other people are doing stuff like this. But having like
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:22.520]  two camera lenses and side by side and that it can do like some kind of magic when you take a
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:30.440]  picture by combining two images and that that's the way that a device as thin as an iPhone
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:36.760]  might be able to stand up to a truly big camera with a bigger piece of really big piece of glass
[2:09:36.760 --> 2:09:42.600]  is the lens and a significant distance. Yeah. So that would be my biggest hope is that it's
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:48.440]  all about the camera. But I say that just purely from my own selfish what I hope they do. This
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:53.400]  has nothing to do with anything that I have heard is coming. Right. What about you? What would you
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:10:01.000]  help for? I mean, I wrote this in a my review of the 6S, you know, the thing that bothers me
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:08.600]  the most about my phone is battery life and having to worry about it. I would, I would be really
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:17.400]  happy if they started to discuss or work in wireless charging. But I just don't feel like the
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:23.720]  solutions out there right now are very Apple. Yeah. That the biggest thing that people keep talking
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:27.320]  about with this remove and that ties into the removal of the headphone jack. The biggest thing
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:32.200]  people are complaining about with that is that they frequently want to listen to audio while they
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:37.400]  charge their phone like you're sitting on the train or on an airplane or something like that and you
[2:10:37.400 --> 2:10:43.400]  have a, your phone is, you know, a 40% well, if you can charge it, but you're sitting there on
[2:10:43.400 --> 2:10:48.600]  the train or wherever you are. My son does this all the time. Jonas is all his, all of his devices
[2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:55.000]  are under 20% at all times. So he's always watching YouTube while with his headphones on while
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:11:00.840]  he's charging his device. If they went to wireless charging, it would, that would solve it. If there
[2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:05.960]  was like an Apple watch type thing that could charge, you know, connect it to the Apple logo or
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:10.680]  something on the back of your phone, that solves the problem where you have that lightning jack
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:17.480]  for your headphones and you can wirelessly charge. Yeah. I mean, the big problem with the wireless,
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:22.120]  and I've tested a lot of these. I did this big piece on chargers last week. It was actually
[2:11:22.840 --> 2:11:31.000]  thrilling in a way. I tested like all these USB wall chargers, but it was that all these wireless
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:37.640]  solutions are just really slow. Like it takes a long time to go from zero to 50% with many of these.
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:42.120]  Right. The watch gets away with it because the watch has just a teeny tiny battery.
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:51.160]  Exactly. Yeah. It'll be interesting. Yeah. I could see that I would like, you know, and if there's
[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:59.880]  a second thing that I would like to see, it would be a a rejiggering of their priorities on how much
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:04.280]  battery life the phone should get. I mean, it's very clear that what they've done,
[2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:09.720]  because like the battery life doesn't get worse year-to-year with iPhone, but it stays the same
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:15.480]  unless you switch to the plus. So they just keep making it thinner and using the efficiencies of
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:20.440]  their newer technology to keep the, you know, they keep making the device thinner and keeping the
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:26.360]  battery life the same. I would love it if they like effectively decided to like multiply the
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:32.920]  the battery life. Right. Expect by like one and a half. And obviously this year they did
[2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:38.920]  a lot of it through iOS 9 and software improvements. And actually, you know, watchOS 2, I've noticed
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:45.000]  the battery life being better on this thing. But it seems like that's the only going to get them so
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:52.280]  far. Yeah, I think what I would like to see them, you know, like with the iPad, I would almost
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:57.640]  said iPod there. They've long said 10 hours of battery life. You get 10 hours of battery life from an
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:06.600]  iPad. I would love for them to just sort of really dub, you know, like double or like 1.5 the number
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:12.280]  that they tell you you can get from an iPhone and then engineer it from there, whether that means
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:19.800]  keeping the device as thin as it is now or using new technology or something like that. But
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:25.400]  I don't think that'll happen though. I would bet against that. I think Apple is very much interested
[2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:32.200]  in chasing down SLR quality photography. So I feel like whether they'll do it next year or not,
[2:13:32.200 --> 2:13:40.600]  at least my hopes are in alignment with Apple's institutional priorities. My hope for battery life,
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:45.160]  though, does not seem to be in alignment with their institutional priorities. Their institutional
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:52.840]  priorities, I think, are still hyper focused on thinness. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree with you there.
[2:13:54.680 --> 2:14:01.000]  Well, we shall see. All right. I'm going to go on vacation first. That's great. I can't wait.
[2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:07.800]  Oh, no, wait. I'm not going. Well, congratulations to the joy of vacation. Joanna
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:14.680]  thank you so much. Vacation to CES. I've never been. Have we ever talked about this?
[2:14:14.680 --> 2:14:19.880]  I think we did and I still can't believe it. How have you never been? I love Vegas. I love
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:25.480]  gadgets and I've never been to CES. It's long story short. It's because I hate Vegas,
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:34.040]  but I love gadgets. All right. The long story short, it's because it used to be immediately
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:40.840]  after Macworld Expo and I did go to Macworld Expo and there was no way that I was going to do
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:47.080]  two of those things back to back. And so I just never, ever developed any kind of tradition of going
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:55.240]  to CES and at any time it's ever occurred to me to maybe maybe I should, maybe just one year I
[2:14:55.240 --> 2:15:03.480]  should go and write about and podcast like what it's like for an Apple focused person to go to
[2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:08.520]  this, you know, more or less this consumer electronic show that is everything that's not Apple in
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:14.680]  the industry. Here's what's coming. But actually everything is around Apple. It's well more and more.
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:18.840]  Yeah. Well, I mean, you keep doing what you do best, which is
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:25.560]  comment on the non Apple stuff, but always pretty much it has been the last couple of years.
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:31.640]  There's always some strong Apple rumor that that seems to come out around CES.
[2:15:31.640 --> 2:15:38.440]  Yeah, it is true. Last year, last year at CES, there was this big rumor about what the MacBook was
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:45.080]  going to the MacBook Air would ultimately end up be the MacBook with the Air successor.
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:52.360]  Is going to look like? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, that they always somehow try to take the air out
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:57.800]  of whatever else is going on. Right. It wouldn't be just come around then. I don't know.
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:03.800]  Yeah. So, you know, I would expect here's my guess is that this year's CES is going to be
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:11.080]  the story is going to be all about virtual reality. I think that's my guess. And would, you know,
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:17.800]  would it be shocking if a rumor leads right before CES that Apple has a team working on VR?
[2:16:18.520 --> 2:16:23.880]  Yeah. And that's it. If they said nothing else, except that that would not surprise me one bit.
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:28.920]  If a rumor like that was floated, you know, to say, you know,
[2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:35.800]  you know, one of the reporters at the Wall Street Journal probably, you know, or something like that,
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:42.120]  wouldn't surprise me one bit. But anyway, I always, when it occurs to me that maybe I should
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:46.200]  go to CES, it's always too late. Like right now, I think it's too late. Like everything's
[2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:50.680]  all the hotels are booked up and, you know, it's like the sort of thing you have to plan
[2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:57.240]  in advance. And I'm not, I'm not good at that. Right. Yeah. Well, I would say you don't really
[2:16:57.240 --> 2:17:02.200]  need to come. I would love to podcast with you from there. Yeah. Do like a little video thing.
[2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:09.160]  It's, it's pretty much, I love CES because it is this time of the year where everyone gets really
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:14.840]  excited about gadgets. And my favorite thing was like, Neil I last year wrote this piece or they
[2:17:14.840 --> 2:17:18.680]  wrote a piece in the Verge was like gadgets are back and like getting really people excited for CES.
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:24.520]  And it was like, that's what I do all year. Like I do like, like good thing I have a job again this
[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:31.800]  year. But, you know, like gets people really excited about what's going to come and then actually
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:35.480]  that it all tapers down. And when you actually review the products that came out at CES and
[2:17:35.480 --> 2:17:40.040]  it wouldn't really cares. But there is always the excitement around CES.
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:52.600]  Yes. People can read your work at the Wall Street Journal. That's the WSJ.com. What's the,
[2:17:52.600 --> 2:18:00.520]  to get to the section that you guys do? What's the web? WSJD.com. WSJD.com takes your
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:10.920]  white right to the Wall Street Journal digital. Yeah. And on Twitter, you are at Joanna Stern. I am.
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:18.280]  Thank you so much, Joanna. It was good to be here. Glad we, we finally made it work.
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:23.880]  We didn't, we didn't talk about our favorite thing, my favorite thing, the Blackberry, but I will
[2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:27.960]  come back to talk about that the next time. All right. Do you think there'll still be a business
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:32.440]  next time? Yes, they have the new Android phone and I gave it a pretty decent review.
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:45.160]  I, I, well, we'll see. We will see. I mean, what, what holds them back? They can just be another
[2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:52.520]  Android phone maker. Maybe I think that's, I think that ship is sailed out. I think that they,
[2:18:52.520 --> 2:18:58.600]  if they had done that, I think, wasn't that what you wrote in your review? I think that if they had shipped
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:02.920]  that phone four years ago. Definitely that is what I wrote in my review, but I, I'm always holding on.
[2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:22.360]  Okay, third stand up thing going to go. Okay.
