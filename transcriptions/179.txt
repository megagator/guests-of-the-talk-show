[00:00.000 --> 00:06.480]  Have a question for you. Here's the linguistic question. I have heard this. I've heard it Bill Simmons is using it
[00:06.480 --> 00:08.480]  I've heard other people using it. There's the
[00:10.320 --> 00:16.920]  The what used to be the something something 1600 podcast though that crew is now have as a new podcast
[00:16.920 --> 00:19.040]  I think it's pod save the Queen
[00:19.880 --> 00:22.400]  People are calling podcast episodes pods
[00:23.640 --> 00:25.640]  I've seen it yet
[00:25.640 --> 00:30.040]  All over the place. It seems to be it is to me the link
[00:31.080 --> 00:33.840]  Linguistic, it's the word of the year so far for 2017
[00:34.800 --> 00:39.320]  I'm almost down with it, even though I am generally a curmudgeon on all
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.900]  Anything that that jiggers with the language
[00:44.920 --> 00:48.760]  What do you think? Well, it makes it makes I think it's fine because well one it's short
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.600]  Right and it it's both short and it's very descriptive
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.360]  You know exactly what it's talking about and it's also fascinating because we've kind of like our careers have
[00:57.520 --> 01:02.060]  Overlapped like the journey of the word pod from being this
[01:02.640 --> 01:10.240]  Apparatus you plug into your computer the iPod and thus being the podcast and now pod being an entirely like it went through a
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.400]  Transfamiliar ation or whatever the word is. It's really interesting. We actually when you think about it, I
[01:16.400 --> 01:18.400]  Think it's fascinating
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.600]  But it in particular it seems like people are using it though to mean episode not
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.280]  The show even though pike on pod save the Queen it I guess it kind of implies that it's the whole it's the show itself
[01:31.560 --> 01:36.200]  Yeah, I think it's part isn't pod save America. Oh, I'd save America whatever the hell their show is called
[01:36.200 --> 01:38.760]  But anyway, I'd the thing that stuck out to me is the use of pot
[01:39.680 --> 01:42.100]  yeah, but that makes sense though because podcast is the
[01:42.100 --> 01:48.980]  Entity, right and then a podcast contains multiple pods. Yeah, I mean if you think about it too much
[01:48.980 --> 01:55.020]  It doesn't make sense. But but if you think it at the appropriate level, it makes perfect sense. I'm I'm down with it. I
[01:55.820 --> 01:58.680]  Think it's a good addition. I wrote about this
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.780]  I I would have to find the link but I wrote about this the first time
[02:04.820 --> 02:10.620]  Apple ever put podcast as a feature in iTunes, which was a
[02:10.620 --> 02:15.340]  Long time ago. I mean we're talking it might have been like 2003. I
[02:15.860 --> 02:19.940]  Know it was 2005 because that was when Odeo was doing podcasts. Yeah
[02:20.820 --> 02:22.820]  Odeo nay Twitter
[02:23.340 --> 02:25.620]  but just how sort of
[02:28.020 --> 02:30.780]  At first I was sort of thinking
[02:30.780 --> 02:38.620]  a way back then that hey Apple might put the kibosh on people calling these things podcasts because they're very touchy-touchy about
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.260]  Trademarks and stuff like that and
[02:49.180 --> 02:53.700]  Then they like kind of embraced the word and it was like whoa what the heck is that
[02:53.700 --> 03:00.260]  And I it it hit me way back then like hey
[03:00.260 --> 03:05.620]  it's kind of genius for them to embrace it because it sort of makes it seem like
[03:07.180 --> 03:09.180]  Podcasts are only meant for iPods
[03:10.260 --> 03:13.260]  like they kind of own the thing and
[03:15.900 --> 03:17.140]  You know
[03:17.140 --> 03:22.940]  At this point, I feel like there's more people who have listened to podcasts period you know
[03:22.940 --> 03:28.180]  Some podcasts now, maybe not my podcast somebody's podcast who've never even owned an iPod. Oh
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.980]  Yeah for sure
[03:32.780 --> 03:39.980]  But yet the word persists but the whole the whole origin of the word is based it's clearly based on the word iPod
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.700]  Yep
[03:42.700 --> 03:50.260]  Yeah, no, it's it's a no you're right. It's really I think if you back up and think about it the
[03:50.260 --> 03:55.620]  The benefit the way it pays out to the iPod at least at that time
[03:55.740 --> 04:00.220]  You know is it's like a you know, it's like there's a classic strategy
[04:01.060 --> 04:06.300]  Technique which is commoditize your compliments basically all the things that make your product really good
[04:06.300 --> 04:08.500]  you want to make them be super common and super free and
[04:09.060 --> 04:16.100]  This is Apple kind of doing it from a branding perspective. Like they they made podcasts the name. They didn't trademark it
[04:16.100 --> 04:22.140]  They let it spread super wide and all crude to the iPod which they you know, we're raking in all the money on
[04:22.700 --> 04:25.860]  it you are indeed your memory if if you were
[04:27.540 --> 04:29.660]  Recalling it from memory is correct. It was from July
[04:31.780 --> 04:33.620]  2005
[04:33.620 --> 04:38.560]  2005 I don't know. What do we call those years now? I don't know. We know what we call them the aughts mid ass
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.180]  Yeah, it was and it was a post I wrote on the site called. Is that a podcast in your pocket?
[04:44.180 --> 04:46.180]  I'll put it in the show notes
[04:49.020 --> 04:55.540]  It is a long article I just found it as well I didn't have an editor back then I
[04:58.980 --> 05:04.060]  Kind of like calling it new pod like that's what Bill Simmons like Bill Simmons announcing a new episode
[05:04.060 --> 05:07.960]  It'll be like new pod and then he'll have like a link to the show. I kind of like it
[05:08.820 --> 05:10.300]  Yeah
[05:10.300 --> 05:12.300]  Now it's yeah
[05:12.300 --> 05:16.820]  It I've the one thing you mentioned before about you people have never had an iPod
[05:16.820 --> 05:21.980]  I get more and more of these of these emails from like striking members or whatever that are
[05:22.500 --> 05:23.620]  like
[05:23.620 --> 05:29.420]  I've officially reached the stage in life where people just say things in passing that just blows my mind
[05:30.300 --> 05:34.160]  About their their relative experience the technology compared to mine
[05:35.060 --> 05:38.820]  Like what give me another example? Oh just like I mean
[05:38.820 --> 05:42.500]  I now at now my I mean a brain freeze
[05:42.500 --> 05:47.940]  I just it's more I remember the emotion that I get from reading these emails. Well, they'll say something in passing about
[05:48.740 --> 05:52.780]  When they got their first phone or their memories about something and like something they'll remember
[05:52.780 --> 05:55.660]  Oh, do you remember back when it was this? I'm like, I remember when I was introduced
[05:57.500 --> 06:00.660]  Nothing's coming to mind right now, but it happens frequently enough
[06:00.820 --> 06:04.380]  It's one of those things where the emotion of the shock at man
[06:04.380 --> 06:09.300]  I'm old is someone who writes and said I like I'll give you like somebody who writes and says like they're a diehard
[06:09.580 --> 06:12.940]  Longtime Apple user and their first Apple product was like the iPhone 4s
[06:15.460 --> 06:17.460]  You're like what
[06:18.460 --> 06:24.020]  I'm gonna send John Syracuse to your house and and I'm gonna have you schooled on what it means to be a longtime Apple user
[06:25.260 --> 06:27.260]  Totally but god bless. Yeah
[06:29.140 --> 06:31.140]  No, oh shoot I'm
[06:31.140 --> 06:37.100]  I am apparently the it being 1230 in the morning aspect is kicking in but how there's something that happened the other day where I
[06:37.500 --> 06:43.820]  Officially shifted to like back like back in my day mode. I felt just oh it was about the box was basketball
[06:43.820 --> 06:49.300]  I just talked about bad us old timers and like if you started what if you started going to games in the 90s and I
[06:49.300 --> 06:56.700]  Felt justified in saying that like that was a really long time ago when like the 90s like don't feel that far away to me
[06:56.700 --> 07:01.900]  But it's actually it has really been like 20 30 years or whatever it is. And yeah
[07:01.900 --> 07:05.940]  The fact that I felt I could say that and no one called me out on it but cheaper on Twitter like yeah
[07:05.940 --> 07:10.480]  Oh, totally. I remember going to these games that are the dough. It's like yeah, we're a bunch of old people now
[07:10.480 --> 07:13.260]  It's it's it's both sort of depressing
[07:13.260 --> 07:19.580]  it's also kind of satisfying like to be able to like sit back and revel in in in your
[07:19.580 --> 07:28.260]  You know being a part of what came before I'm embracing it. I'm leaning into it. I'm gonna do a pot about it. Let
[07:29.060 --> 07:30.820]  Me take a break right off the bat
[07:30.820 --> 07:35.400]  Let's just get this rolling and and get a sponsor break out of the way and let me talk to you about
[07:35.780 --> 07:40.500]  One of one of the best new sponsors we've got on this show. It's a company called away
[07:41.500 --> 07:42.660]  away
[07:42.660 --> 07:48.860]  Uses high quality materials that other brands use but they sell at much lower prices
[07:48.860 --> 07:50.860]  What do they make they make?
[07:51.380 --> 07:55.660]  Luggage, they have three sizes the carry-on the medium the large
[07:56.300 --> 08:01.180]  The large is huge. It's it's like if you're like leaving your family, you know, it's like really really big
[08:01.460 --> 08:05.000]  All their suitcases are made with premium German
[08:05.580 --> 08:07.260]  parley carbonate
[08:07.260 --> 08:14.380]  Unrivaled in strength and impact resistance and very lightweight the interior of all their suitcases features patent-pending
[08:14.380 --> 08:21.240]  Compression systems helpful for over packers. In other words, you open it up and it's not just like like like a rectangle like a
[08:22.080 --> 08:24.080]  cube inside
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.400]  They've got like compartments inside. They've got little things that help you that help you organize your stuff
[08:29.980 --> 08:34.420]  They have a TSA approved combination lock built into the top of all their bags to prevent theft
[08:35.640 --> 08:41.920]  Removable washable laundry bag right inside. So this is a great idea. What do you do with your dirty clothes when you pack?
[08:41.920 --> 08:45.520]  This is what I do. I I never think ahead I go on a trip and I think well
[08:45.520 --> 08:50.480]  Here's all the clothes I'm going to take and then I get there and then once I get there I start piling up dirty clothes
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.500]  I just put them put them in a corner and it's like just just ignore until I pack up to leave
[08:55.600 --> 09:00.840]  They give you a washable laundry bag. You can actually have a place to put your dirty clothes
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.040]  When you are in your hotel room or whatever that wherever the heck you're staying
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.920]  Really really great. Now. Look, why are they advertising on the talk show? What what's this got to do with technology?
[09:12.040 --> 09:14.520]  Well, not every sponsor has something to do with technology
[09:14.520 --> 09:21.060]  But these guys do the carry-on from away is able to charge all cell phones tablets
[09:21.520 --> 09:25.940]  E-readers anything else that's powered by a USB cord because it has a built-in
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.920]  Battery right in the case. So
[09:29.920 --> 09:36.840]  This is super convenient. This is amazing. You just sit there at your seat in the airport while you're waiting for your flight to
[09:37.280 --> 09:43.520]  For them to tell you to board and you could just plug any cable right into the top of the suitcase and charge your phone
[09:43.800 --> 09:51.320]  Right from your carry-on. They got a lifetime warranty anything breaks. They'll fix it for you for life 100 day trial
[09:51.840 --> 09:54.320]  Get one of these suitcases live with it
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.440]  Travel with it Instagram it whatever you want to do
[09:57.440 --> 10:04.040]  And if you don't like it return it for a full refund no questions asked free shipping on any away order within
[10:04.280 --> 10:08.160]  The continental u.s. This is a great product. I need a new suitcase
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.080]  I don't have one of these yet and I feel terrible that I don't because my carry-on suitcase is a wreck
[10:14.080 --> 10:20.720]  It is it is like ripped up. It is it's got wheels that don't roll. It's terrible. I'm buying one of these things. So

[10:57.800 --> 10:59.800]  Want to talk about the NFL
[11:01.960 --> 11:10.040]  Well, we were originally gonna record what was it last week when I waited until until my Packers were humbled after after defeating your
[11:10.040 --> 11:12.040]  Cowboy, I didn't do that on purpose. I
[11:12.040 --> 11:18.240]  Didn't get the chance to uh to do a double or nothing after our unfortunate that the last time I was on the podcast
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.880]  What do we I owe you? What do I owe you a drink? I owe you drinks the next time the whole bar
[11:22.880 --> 11:24.600]  Oh, I know I owe you dinner
[11:24.600 --> 11:30.720]  Why is that we we bet before the regular season game between the Packers and and the end the cowboys?
[11:31.360 --> 11:33.960]  And we lost we lost soundly
[11:35.200 --> 11:41.040]  It doesn't seem right though. It doesn't seem right that I that you owe me given that the Packers beat the Cowboys in the playoffs
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.960]  It doesn't seem right when it when it counts when it counts. I forgot to specify the bet is about when it counts
[11:47.240 --> 11:49.960]  So you're a lifelong Green Bay Packers fan
[11:50.480 --> 11:52.920]  I'm a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.200]  The Cowboys and the Packers played at this point was at 10 days ago
[11:59.920 --> 12:01.920]  11 days ago
[12:02.120 --> 12:08.220]  Was honestly in all in my opinion. It was the only good playoff game in the entire NFL playoffs to date
[12:08.220 --> 12:13.900]  Oh, yeah, it's been that brutal. It's been brutal. Well, it wasn't just one of the only good playoff game of these playoffs
[12:13.900 --> 12:20.180]  It was like one of the all-time great playoff games of all time. Yeah, it so it was an all-time great game and
[12:20.940 --> 12:23.540]  But it was literally the only decent playoff game
[12:23.540 --> 12:27.740]  I mean the only other one that you could even make an argument for would be the the Steelers
[12:28.380 --> 12:34.260]  Chiefs game on the same day it which was a game that was won by a team that kicked six field goals
[12:34.260 --> 12:40.900]  So if you want to argue if you're like in the greater Pittsburgh area
[12:40.900 --> 12:46.700]  and you want to argue that that was a good game to in a game where your team won with
[12:47.460 --> 12:52.100]  Six field goals. Okay, fine. You know, that was a great game. Yeah, sure
[12:53.460 --> 12:58.300]  Otherwise, this was the only good game of the playoffs, but it like you said it was seriously like an all-time great game
[12:58.900 --> 13:03.180]  And I'm yeah, well our two teams have been in a have been in a few of those
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.540]  I
[13:04.540 --> 13:12.460]  Liked it. Yeah, I liked it in the 90s when the Packers enough it when the Packers and Cowboys would meet every single year and
[13:12.700 --> 13:18.420]  Every single year no matter what happened. The Cowboys would eat beat them handily. That's what I love
[13:19.020 --> 13:24.900]  Yeah, I don't like me not me not so I I tweeted immediately after the game that that victory was for Farve
[13:27.180 --> 13:31.780]  Yes, all the all the emotions of those 90s losses
[13:31.780 --> 13:34.100]  Came came rushing back at the end of that game
[13:34.820 --> 13:41.620]  What I remember from the early from the first years that this became a rivalry in the early Farve years when Farve was was
[13:41.620 --> 13:48.420]  A young up-and-coming quarterback was the ridiculous distances that Farve could throw a football like
[13:49.940 --> 13:56.700]  You know, they'd be like on like the 30-yard line and time would be running out in the first half and it would be like well
[13:56.700 --> 14:01.940]  I don't know. They're just you know, throw it to like the 20 and hope something happens instead
[14:01.940 --> 14:03.700]  He'd throw it all the way into the end zone. You'd be like no wait
[14:03.700 --> 14:06.500]  I thought they were at the 30 and then they'd show the replay and it was like oh, yeah
[14:06.500 --> 14:09.220]  They were at the 30 and he still threw it all the way to the end zone
[14:10.180 --> 14:12.180]  like he
[14:13.180 --> 14:17.220]  He could throw the ball like silly distances like like like throwing in a Robey
[14:18.740 --> 14:25.340]  Yeah, no, I mean it's it's hard to I mean obviously all the stuff with Farve sort of ended badly with Green Bay and and there
[14:25.340 --> 14:28.060]  was some enmity there for sure
[14:28.380 --> 14:34.260]  But I think it here's like here's where I get a pull of the that rhetorical trick for us long time Packers fans
[14:34.540 --> 14:40.620]  Who grew up with the team just being just brutal and awful and I got you know, I started in the 80s
[14:40.620 --> 14:45.500]  So that was they've been brutal for like 20 years before then. So yeah worse worse for other folks like my like my dad
[14:45.900 --> 14:47.900]  but I mean
[14:48.220 --> 14:51.380]  The way he utterly and completely transformed that franchise
[14:51.380 --> 14:56.500]  I mean, it's it's I mean over the last we were talking about this the other day like over the last like 25 years
[14:56.500 --> 15:01.580]  Whatever like I believe it's the Packers and Patriots and Steelers are one two
[15:01.580 --> 15:06.420]  three as far as like both record number of playoff appearances all those sorts of things and and
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.420]  Really the guy that made that all happen
[15:09.420 --> 15:12.060]  I mean Wolf will trade for him and stuff is a great GM
[15:12.060 --> 15:16.540]  But Farve was the the guy who just transformed that franchise and what it meant
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.180]  For people who aren't sports fans
[15:19.180 --> 15:26.460]  The Packers are an interesting story because they are unique in America among all professional sports teams
[15:28.020 --> 15:36.260]  Basketball hockey football baseball all four major sports. The Packers are unique in that they are
[15:37.980 --> 15:42.860]  They're owned by their fans more or less I mean, can you I I am an owner kid
[15:42.860 --> 15:44.980]  Can you explain the the difference?
[15:44.980 --> 15:51.020]  I mean every other team has like one rich guy who is the owner of the team and is a jerk and
[15:51.580 --> 15:52.700]  probably a
[15:52.700 --> 15:54.380]  Trump supporter
[15:54.380 --> 15:58.940]  In all sports the Packers are are different. I'm not sure the Packers can
[15:59.700 --> 16:02.140]  Can well because they're from Wisconsin, so
[16:02.660 --> 16:09.420]  But not just Wisconsin, but northern Wisconsin, which is uh, yeah that not not not a left-leaning liberal country
[16:09.420 --> 16:11.900]  We'll put it that way. Can you explain the ownership structure of the Packers?
[16:11.900 --> 16:18.940]  So so the Packers were owned by an owner at some way but it's sometime way back when I want to say back in like
[16:18.940 --> 16:20.940]  the the
[16:21.420 --> 16:25.500]  The 20s or something like that like way back because they're one of the original football teams
[16:25.820 --> 16:29.660]  They were going to go out of business or something like that
[16:29.660 --> 16:35.020]  But but they they established the the articles of incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation
[16:35.820 --> 16:40.620]  And it was sold to basically people in the community. They could buy in a piece
[16:40.620 --> 16:47.580]  and then it was written into the bylaws that if it was ever sold that all the money would go to the local post of
[16:47.580 --> 16:49.580]  the American Legion
[16:49.580 --> 16:55.260]  So that's still the case today. So if the team has ever sold all the proceeds go to the local American Legion post
[16:57.260 --> 17:02.380]  Probably worth at least I would guess like at least like one or two billion dollars. Oh, yeah for sure
[17:02.380 --> 17:06.940]  I mean like, you know, like we we always talk about like the Americas team, right?
[17:06.940 --> 17:16.540]  But there's there's there's basically five big teams the NFL that have national followings like their their lines in Vegas get set differently
[17:16.620 --> 17:22.460]  Because they attract so much betting from fans and that's your your Cowboys the Packers the Raiders
[17:23.020 --> 17:25.660]  The Steelers and then the Patriots are the kind of the newest addition
[17:26.860 --> 17:29.980]  Patriots have sort of snuck in just by virtue of
[17:31.020 --> 17:33.260]  15 years of non-stop winning
[17:33.260 --> 17:37.260]  Right, right, because I mean the Packers the Packers were pretty dominant in the early part of the NFL
[17:37.500 --> 17:40.860]  and so like when they won the first two Super Bowls that was kind of the tail end of their
[17:41.420 --> 17:46.700]  About just a multi-decade run of dominance and then in the 70s, obviously the Steelers and the Cowboys
[17:47.340 --> 17:52.540]  And then the Raiders came along and then the Cowboys obviously had a return return to glory. But
[17:53.980 --> 17:59.420]  But yeah, so so what happened was in a few years ago when they want to expand Lambeau Field to raise money
[17:59.420 --> 18:08.300]  They did another share issuance. So they sold another 250,000 shares at at $250 a piece and just raised a ton of money for the stadium
[18:08.300 --> 18:11.020]  And all these shares are totally worthless. Like there's you can't sell them
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.180]  I mean you could sell them on the side, but you can't convert them for money or anything
[18:16.460 --> 18:21.820]  But yeah, I have one so I have it. It's it's sitting in a box right now. I haven't actually put it up
[18:22.700 --> 18:26.780]  Here in Taiwan, but I am a I am a proud owner of the other Green Bay Packers
[18:26.780 --> 18:30.940]  It is sort of silly but it is to me
[18:31.740 --> 18:38.140]  It's the way most teams should be owned like even though it's the opposite and the Packers are in fact this odd
[18:39.880 --> 18:41.740]  Exception
[18:41.740 --> 18:44.700]  In it really is the way most teams should be owned
[18:44.700 --> 18:49.180]  They should be owned by the local fans because it it would take off the table
[18:49.420 --> 18:55.180]  The extortion that these owners put their fans through every time they need new stadiums built, you know, it's
[18:55.180 --> 18:58.060]  There there's an honesty to it where it's like look
[18:58.060 --> 19:01.420]  The only reason to buy shares in the Packers is if you're a Packers fan
[19:01.740 --> 19:07.900]  Right and the Packers aren't going anywhere like nobody is ever like the Packers are never saying like give us
[19:08.460 --> 19:15.900]  You know a 500 million dollar expansion of Lambeau Field or we're moving to Los Angeles like that's never even on the table, right?
[19:15.900 --> 19:17.820]  They're not going anywhere
[19:17.820 --> 19:23.740]  Right and every other team or half the teams, you know, I mean like maybe you know, Dallas isn't going anywhere
[19:23.740 --> 19:29.260]  But look at the Raiders the Raiders that have moved they've moved to Los Angeles. They went back to Oakland now
[19:30.540 --> 19:33.820]  Is it a done deal? Are they going to Vegas? I think it's all but a done deal
[19:33.820 --> 19:37.980]  I don't think it's been announced yet. But yeah, they're gonna move move to Las Vegas because you know, the the
[19:38.940 --> 19:44.620]  What's it called the a-okay Stadium and Coliseum in Oakland is it really is a shithole?
[19:45.660 --> 19:48.460]  And they could so now they're moving to Vegas
[19:48.460 --> 19:55.820]  Vegas the Eagles have gone through this in Philadelphia like there are no
[19:56.780 --> 20:00.460]  better fans or more loyal fans or or die-hard maybe
[20:01.100 --> 20:07.260]  Die-hard is maybe the way to go then Philadelphia Eagles fans. I'm not an Eagles fan, but I live I'm surrounded by them
[20:07.420 --> 20:13.740]  They're great fans years ago before they built the the the Lincoln financial field that they have now the the there
[20:13.820 --> 20:17.020]  There were threats that they were going to move the Eagles to Los Angeles
[20:17.020 --> 20:20.620]  I mean it would have ripped the city apart. It's not right
[20:22.300 --> 20:25.660]  But it's a privately held, you know team
[20:27.580 --> 20:32.540]  Yeah, I mean can really work in the NFL because so much of the the NFL is so
[20:33.660 --> 20:40.860]  aggressive in its revenue sharing and the TV deals are so massive that you know Green Bay can compete on an even playing field even
[20:40.860 --> 20:44.140]  Though they they they make much less money locally
[20:44.140 --> 20:49.260]  Although that was part of sort of the refurbishment that they did of Lambeau Field when I was able to buy it by my share
[20:49.340 --> 20:50.620]  my single share
[20:50.620 --> 20:57.260]  Was basically making sort of a year-round destination and like people do like poker niches and stuff there but relative to like, you know
[20:57.420 --> 21:00.140]  The you know Jerry's like Jerry dome or whatever
[21:00.700 --> 21:04.460]  they don't make as much locally, but because the vast majority of
[21:05.100 --> 21:10.460]  The money that ltbs get is from the TV deal and and from and all ticket sales have to be shared by and large
[21:10.460 --> 21:12.780]  I think except for like luxury boxes they um
[21:12.780 --> 21:17.500]  Yeah, they can they can do it and pull it off and then obviously, you know, if they're the team for Wisconsin
[21:17.500 --> 21:21.820]  So I I mean they're their television market is effectively, Wisconsin
[21:22.460 --> 21:25.100]  And so they they certainly they certainly do well
[21:25.740 --> 21:26.540]  But yeah, it's super unique
[21:26.540 --> 21:30.860]  they had to be grandfathered into like the NFL's like governance like document because
[21:31.260 --> 21:35.420]  It does state that no team could have more than like X number of owners
[21:35.420 --> 21:42.780]  And the greenbackers have three hundred and sixty thousand of them. So right. It's sort of like they want to avoid the situation. We're like
[21:43.420 --> 21:45.740]  ten people, you know, like
[21:46.540 --> 21:49.020]  me and you and Marco and
[21:49.900 --> 21:51.260]  Guy English
[21:51.260 --> 21:55.660]  Join in and buy an NFL team and we fight with each other and can't make decisions
[21:56.540 --> 22:01.660]  They want to avoid that and so that's why they have these these rules that you know
[22:01.660 --> 22:08.700]  They what they want are guys like Jerry Jones who just can make decisions on their own. Just just to simplify things
[22:09.500 --> 22:10.620]  and
[22:10.620 --> 22:13.260]  Packers have like a million owners
[22:14.140 --> 22:17.020]  Yes, I'm really like a page Wikipedia page right now
[22:17.100 --> 22:22.380]  Yeah, even though it's referred to as common stock a share of packer stock does not share the same rights
[22:22.380 --> 22:28.140]  It does not have equity interest does not pay dividends cannot be traded has no securities off protection and brings no season ticket purchase
[22:28.140 --> 22:31.740]  And brings no season ticket purchase. It doesn't even get you a seat
[22:33.820 --> 22:36.060]  The Packers have like a 50-year waiting list or something
[22:36.620 --> 22:42.780]  Which is insane because I actually have very little desire to go to a game in January Green Bay. I can tell you that
[22:43.020 --> 22:47.420]  It's uh, it's like a college team in so far is like nobody lives there
[22:47.500 --> 22:51.180]  I mean i'm looking at the Wikipedia page for the Green Bay metropolitan area and the
[22:51.820 --> 22:55.820]  This there's two hundred eighty thousand people. It's it's not even a
[22:55.820 --> 22:57.820]  It's not even a real city
[22:57.900 --> 22:59.260]  Yeah
[22:59.260 --> 23:02.540]  Yeah, no, so people will so that what they did for a long time is they had
[23:03.420 --> 23:08.780]  six games a year in Green Bay and two games a year in Milwaukee when at County Stadium where the Rouge is to play and
[23:09.180 --> 23:13.660]  And they did that when like when the team was having was in a rough time and it's kind of like, you know
[23:13.900 --> 23:18.300]  build up the fan base or whatever, but now all the games are on Lambeau Field and and
[23:19.580 --> 23:23.660]  You have like these grand caravans that go up from the it's all the Milwaukee's
[23:23.660 --> 23:26.140]  season ticket holders got to keep their seats
[23:26.140 --> 23:28.140]  So they have seats for two games a year
[23:28.300 --> 23:32.300]  And then the Green Bay ticket holders have seats for the other six games a year or something like that
[23:32.300 --> 23:33.900]  It's this whole convoluted thing
[23:33.900 --> 23:38.860]  But the the net of it is is like I mean, Wisconsin is is I mean, it's Packers country
[23:38.860 --> 23:42.940]  I mean more than more than anything else. I mean it is it is you cannot go
[23:43.500 --> 23:45.500]  You know in the football season can't go five feet without
[23:45.980 --> 23:51.820]  Encountering some sort of you know Packers paraphernalia somehow they're taken seriously yet their fans are called cheesehead
[23:51.820 --> 23:57.100]  Oh, it's really yeah, the the cheese that thing is something that all Wisconsin. I have to come to grips with eventually
[23:57.660 --> 24:02.540]  Apple maps apple map says it's a two-hour drive from Milwaukee to Green Bay. Does that sound right to you?
[24:03.100 --> 24:05.100]  Yeah, and and I think the um
[24:05.420 --> 24:10.620]  Yeah, that's in. Yep. It's a beautiful drive, but I think on stadium days. It's probably or game days
[24:10.620 --> 24:14.300]  It's probably a lot longer because it's it's a whole caravan moving up. Yeah
[24:17.340 --> 24:19.900]  All right, yeah well the other the other thing that's marching to me is that
[24:19.900 --> 24:26.140]  You need to get back into into basketball. I do because your Philadelphia 76ers are
[24:26.860 --> 24:33.420]  Shaping up to be the the 76ers Milwaukee Bucks rivalry over the next 10 years is going to be no
[24:33.420 --> 24:36.620]  I'm serious. It's gonna be amazing. I know we've got uh
[24:37.420 --> 24:39.420]  What's his name? Well indeed?
[24:39.420 --> 24:41.420]  And he's super exciting
[24:41.420 --> 24:45.900]  Uh, you know, I saw him at a restaurant here in Philadelphia a couple couple
[24:45.900 --> 24:49.500]  Actually, I was gonna say weeks ago might have been months ago. Uh
[24:50.060 --> 24:56.540]  he was we went out to dinner at a nice little steakhouse here and and he was there and
[24:57.660 --> 24:59.660]  He's he's a very tall man
[25:00.380 --> 25:02.380]  Yeah, he draws a lot of attention
[25:03.180 --> 25:05.180]  Yeah
[25:05.500 --> 25:07.500]  I am not I
[25:08.380 --> 25:10.380]  I have been around
[25:10.380 --> 25:13.580]  Like college basketball players. I'm you know, I'm I'm not always
[25:13.580 --> 25:18.620]  You know, I've been around Craig Hockenberry. I know what it's like to not even be close to being the tallest person in a room
[25:19.020 --> 25:22.060]  I'm generally close and you're a pretty tall guy. I am pretty tall
[25:22.060 --> 25:27.100]  I'm six foot two. It's pretty tall and it's usually maybe if not the tallest you're you're
[25:27.660 --> 25:33.580]  Up there. I'm not used to being around somebody who would have to stoop to put his chin on top of my hand
[25:35.020 --> 25:37.020]  It is very very large
[25:37.260 --> 25:41.600]  But the other exciting thing about the Sixers is uh, Ben Simmons his first
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.500]  Is uh, Ben Simmons his his foot is is healing quite nicely they say
[25:47.860 --> 25:49.380]  Yeah, and he'll be back soon
[25:49.380 --> 25:54.020]  So well the uh, yeah, I know it should be about tall the I mean the Bucks star player is uh, Yanis
[25:54.020 --> 25:56.500]  I don't know Kumpo. Oh say it again. Say it again
[25:57.460 --> 25:59.460]  Yanis on to the Kumpo
[25:59.860 --> 26:03.780]  Uh, which is a Nigerian name that was translated into Greek and then now is here in the U.S
[26:04.420 --> 26:07.780]  Everyone just calls him Yanis including Bucks fans. Yeah, they should just change his name
[26:07.780 --> 26:11.940]  Just get rid of that last name and just change them, you know, like Madonna just like Yanis
[26:13.780 --> 26:15.420]  You might as well be an NBA Twitter
[26:15.420 --> 26:20.260]  but but he was in Taiwan actually a couple years ago and I got the chance to meet him when he was here and
[26:20.380 --> 26:26.380]  I saw my Instagram for it's like 86 weeks ago. But uh, but yeah, I am I come up to below his shoulder
[26:27.340 --> 26:31.420]  He is every just see 611. He's just like ridiculous. It's ridiculous
[26:31.820 --> 26:36.100]  so the Sixers the Sixers are a good case study to me of
[26:36.100 --> 26:44.180]  One of my fundamental theories of sports, which makes no sense, but I believe it firmly which is that you don't
[26:44.980 --> 26:53.420]  Screw with your uniforms you pick a uniform that is gonna last for the ages and then you you tweak it as
[26:54.420 --> 27:02.140]  Minorly as possible through the decades. That's number one reason why my favorite team in the world is the Yankees Yankees
[27:02.140 --> 27:08.820]  The they don't screw with the uniforms Babe Ruth's uniform was like the same as the uniform they wear today except it was like
[27:09.300 --> 27:15.540]  Made out of I don't know felt or something some different material than the polyester that they can do today
[27:17.060 --> 27:21.660]  You know the Yankees tried cotton in the George Costanza era didn't work out
[27:22.740 --> 27:25.720]  But in terms of the way the uniform looks they don't mess with it
[27:25.720 --> 27:32.060]  The Dallas Cowboys don't mess with the uniforms when they have they they have they used to have like a special like Sunday night
[27:32.060 --> 27:38.140]  Uniform with stars on the shoulders and they'd lost every game. They played with those uniforms the Green Bay Terrible
[27:38.140 --> 27:39.700]  Those are they look terrible
[27:39.700 --> 27:44.460]  There is just a stupid excuse to sell a third Jersey to people who wanted to have every Jersey
[27:44.780 --> 27:49.420]  One of the things that's great about the Green Bay Packers Green Bay Packers look like the Green Bay Packers
[27:49.420 --> 27:53.020]  If you look at like Super Bowl one and you see Bart Starr
[27:53.420 --> 28:00.220]  Leading the team to the first Super Bowl 51 years ago. They look like the team that's playing today because they don't screw with the uniform
[28:00.220 --> 28:01.700]  this
[28:01.700 --> 28:04.500]  Philadelphia 76ers had a great uniform
[28:05.380 --> 28:06.900]  What I mean, it's a great name
[28:06.900 --> 28:12.100]  I mean who knows what sense it makes but I mean Philadelphia is where the country started you call them the 76ers
[28:12.100 --> 28:15.080]  So there you go, you go patriotic. You got to be red white and blue, right?
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.020]  but somehow during the Allen Iverson era they changed to
[28:19.580 --> 28:25.940]  Black gold. Oh, yeah, how a star this weird star, right? How can a team in Philadelphia?
[28:25.940 --> 28:28.580]  that's named after the the
[28:28.580 --> 28:30.940]  American Revolution and or
[28:31.500 --> 28:35.620]  independence, whatever you want to call it in 76 not be red white and blue and
[28:36.300 --> 28:40.220]  Yet they did and then they had you know terrible rule. Of course, they had terrible records
[28:40.220 --> 28:45.420]  How can you win when you're going against the sports gods by by screwing with your uniform now?
[28:45.420 --> 28:48.880]  The Sixers have gone back to it's not quite the classic
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.120]  I I kind of don't like the way they spell out Sixers on the uniform
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.260]  I feel like they ought to go back to the pure. Dr. J era uniform, but it's close enough
[28:57.260 --> 28:59.460]  Yeah, no, I mean the Bucks are definitely fit with that
[28:59.460 --> 29:04.780]  I mean they're so first off their classic uniform and their classic logo are both amazing
[29:05.700 --> 29:10.140]  The classic logo is this like cartoony buck kissing a basketball. Yeah, I love it
[29:10.140 --> 29:14.380]  It's sort of like he's sort of like a green green sweater on sort of like bullwinkle
[29:14.380 --> 29:18.820]  Yeah, right and they had great uniforms back in the 80s and that's when the team was good
[29:18.820 --> 29:23.020]  They won the title in 70s with with with then Luell Cindor later Korean Abdul-Jabbar
[29:23.020 --> 29:26.020]  And then they they were good in the 80s, you know, always lost in the 80s
[29:26.020 --> 29:32.020]  They're in the 80s, you know always lost to your 76ers in Celtics, but very strong team then 1993
[29:32.020 --> 29:34.020]  They they had this
[29:34.460 --> 29:38.220]  Awful logo that's like the purple and this terrible. It was just awful
[29:38.220 --> 29:42.260]  The universe were bad and they've been pretty much terrible ever since they had like one good year since then
[29:42.740 --> 29:47.740]  And then in 2015, they did a redesign which is not the old logo
[29:47.740 --> 29:53.900]  but it's the uniforms especially are are definitely a go back to the original especially this kind of this this
[29:53.900 --> 29:57.060]  paneling on the side that was really really good and
[29:57.980 --> 30:03.500]  Sure enough the team's fortunes that have are looking up but but there's this hilarious tweet. You got to put in the show notes
[30:05.020 --> 30:07.860]  The tweet reads you have to read it to appreciate it
[30:07.860 --> 30:12.900]  It reads America's slow but very real decline into a fascist state as told by the walking bucks
[30:14.180 --> 30:17.820]  Just go just follow the link. You have to see the tweet to appreciate it
[30:17.820 --> 30:24.060]  But I promise you you'll after your rear end off because it's it's it's really funny. All right, I will put it in the show notes
[30:24.060 --> 30:28.020]  All right before we get off sports. Let me give you this. I'm gonna toss this out there. Here we go
[30:28.020 --> 30:30.380]  Here's here's here's a contentious argument
[30:31.380 --> 30:33.380]  top quarterbacks of all time
[30:34.700 --> 30:36.460]  Mmm
[30:36.460 --> 30:40.860]  That is a contentious. You sent me a link. You sent me a link last night to a video
[30:41.380 --> 30:46.100]  You sent it right of the was it you you know, I don't think so
[30:46.100 --> 30:51.340]  It wasn't you who sent me the link to the the cab with John Elway in it. Oh, yeah, I did
[30:51.340 --> 30:56.420]  I did send that. Yeah. Yeah, that was great. So then somebody was in a cab in Pittsburgh
[30:58.780 --> 31:01.900]  And talking to their cab driver about who the greatest
[31:01.980 --> 31:05.900]  Quarterbacks of all time were and his even though this guy was a cab driver in Pittsburgh
[31:05.900 --> 31:12.140]  His number one pick was John Elway and it just so happened that among the people in the cab one of one of them was
[31:12.140 --> 31:18.580]  John Elway and they let it go on for two or three minutes before they they let the cab driver though
[31:18.580 --> 31:23.220]  Whoever was filming in the middle was pretty devious about it. She's like, oh, yeah. Do you think he's attractive?
[31:23.220 --> 31:26.900]  Yeah, you want to sleep with them? Then she goes like I bet you'd sleep with them. It's like his wife
[31:28.020 --> 31:30.020]  right
[31:31.220 --> 31:36.180]  All right top quarterbacks of all time, all right, let me ask you this I'll just give you a simple question who's better farve or
[31:36.700 --> 31:38.700]  Aaron Rodgers. Oh
[31:38.700 --> 31:40.700]  I
[31:44.220 --> 31:46.220]  Think from a a
[31:47.420 --> 31:50.380]  Pure between-the-lines perspective
[31:52.180 --> 31:55.820]  Rogers is probably better just like Farve's recklessness made him great
[31:55.820 --> 32:03.260]  But it it went like it cost us a lot of games. You're blinded by your fandom. The answer is clearly Aaron Rodgers. No
[32:03.260 --> 32:10.900]  Oh, okay. Well, but yeah, that's fair. Yeah, but from a meaningful a legendary status and meaningfulness of the franchise
[32:10.900 --> 32:15.780]  I would have to go with Africa Farve now Rogers needs to win that win a couple more Super Bowls to surpass them right now
[32:15.780 --> 32:17.780]  They're both at one which is shame
[32:18.300 --> 32:24.600]  It doesn't matter Aaron Rodgers could never win another Super Bowl and it doesn't matter Aaron Rodgers is better quarterback than Brad far
[32:24.900 --> 32:31.380]  Yeah, very fair enough. But if you dig that like the totality of their contribution to the Green Bay Packers, it's it's more complicated
[32:31.380 --> 32:34.440]  But yeah, I would agree with that. You're right
[32:34.440 --> 32:40.820]  I am bland blinded by my being a impressionable teenage boy and Brett Farve basically like saving my sports life
[32:40.820 --> 32:45.860]  Did you see my link the other day to triumph the insult comic dog at?
[32:46.740 --> 32:53.060]  The inaugural I thought I did I didn't I haven't watched it though. Well at the end when he first has to utter the words
[32:53.060 --> 33:00.220]  President and then followed by the word Trump every time he tries to say it. He starts vomiting
[33:02.220 --> 33:09.700]  That's how I feel with me saying that among the top five of all time at this point you've absolutely positively got include
[33:10.020 --> 33:11.580]  Tom Brady
[33:11.580 --> 33:18.460]  There I go. Yeah, it hurts to say it. I'm gonna edit it out. Here I am. I'm puking right now. Ah, there it goes
[33:18.460 --> 33:25.460]  It hurts there goes there goes my breakfast but it's undeniable at this point
[33:26.220 --> 33:30.940]  Yeah, I mean the record speaks. I mean the record speaks for itself, obviously, I mean 7th Super Bowl
[33:32.180 --> 33:34.180]  It's always tricky to like
[33:34.420 --> 33:38.500]  Separate the the greatest quarterbacks from the greatest coaches
[33:38.500 --> 33:45.060]  Well, yeah, where where how does that relationship actually play out because so many of them are in the same conversation, right?
[33:45.060 --> 33:49.900]  Right. Well, I mean, what if Rogers had been the quarterback of the Patriots for the last 15 years?
[33:50.540 --> 33:57.660]  Like would his would they be better or worse or the same like it's almost impossible. I mean Mike McCarthy is an okay coach
[33:57.660 --> 34:00.340]  I think he's he gets probably more grief than he deserves
[34:00.540 --> 34:05.540]  but at the same time like he's not even in the same universe as Bill Belichick and
[34:06.420 --> 34:10.660]  And you know, what difference does that make or someone like Joe Montana and like, you know
[34:10.660 --> 34:17.140]  Bill Walsh was so far ahead of everyone when it comes to his scheme and things like that and you get Jerry Rice
[34:17.140 --> 34:23.180]  I mean like but he was a great quarterback, but that's and this always I mean football stuff because it's where do you where do you?
[34:23.180 --> 34:24.300]  sort of
[34:24.300 --> 34:27.940]  Figure out where the boundary is Roger Staubach and Tom Landry
[34:27.940 --> 34:32.680]  I mean Tom Landry literally invented the shotgun formation like that was something that was like
[34:34.420 --> 34:36.900]  It's like you watch it now there are some teams that never even
[34:36.900 --> 34:41.060]  don't they even use the shotgun on running plays now and
[34:41.700 --> 34:44.580]  To think that it was like a loophole in the rules
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.100]  Yeah
[34:47.100 --> 34:49.340]  He like read the rule book and he was like, you know
[34:49.340 --> 34:52.840]  There's nothing that says you have to like hand the ball from the center to the quarterback
[34:52.840 --> 34:59.660]  We could just like toss it back five yards and basically all football is like discovering and exploiting loopholes
[34:59.660 --> 35:02.580]  Right, like if the forward pass is basically a loophole, right?
[35:02.580 --> 35:08.100]  And sort of yeah, I think in the long term man Dan Marino Don Shula, right?
[35:08.100 --> 35:13.520]  it's it's the all the quarterbacks that you mentioned almost everyone who I think you would mention in the
[35:13.700 --> 35:18.980]  If you're gonna put together a top five list have a coach who is arguably in the top five
[35:20.500 --> 35:24.300]  That's why John Elway might be the best though like that because he's the one who might be right
[35:24.300 --> 35:27.340]  Right that Elway's the one who you're like who the hell was his coach
[35:27.340 --> 35:35.300]  Yep, right, it wasn't like greaves or graves. Oh, I don't even know you went to you went to Atlanta later
[35:35.300 --> 35:38.420]  But yeah, I finally won with Mike Shanahan at the end of his career, right?
[35:38.420 --> 35:38.760]  But yeah
[35:38.760 --> 35:39.580]  I mean
[35:39.580 --> 35:42.860]  To my mind that I'd almost tempted to pick him for that reason alone
[35:43.060 --> 35:47.060]  Because like there's really no one else you can ascribe his greatness to right
[35:48.820 --> 35:49.500]  All right
[35:49.500 --> 35:54.420]  Let's take another break and thank our next sponsor and then we'll get on to the real meat of the show
[35:54.420 --> 35:57.500]  And our next sponsor is great company
[35:58.060 --> 36:04.420]  Eero ee ro look Wi-Fi is more important today than it's ever been
[36:05.340 --> 36:09.780]  Most of us have our whole house. We've connected with devices that are on the internet
[36:09.780 --> 36:14.980]  And how are they on the internet? They're on the internet through Wi-Fi outside the smartphone. It's probably the technology
[36:14.980 --> 36:19.960]  We depend on most it's a core utility of the 21st century home
[36:19.960 --> 36:26.280]  But despite its importance Wi-Fi is broken. Imagine if your electricity in your house
[36:26.980 --> 36:28.980]  didn't reach certain parts or
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.320]  Like it was intermittent like you got really good electricity
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.900]  In your living room, but in your master bedroom, it's like some days. It's okay. Sometimes, you know, you don't get electricity
[36:41.120 --> 36:47.800]  Well, you'd call electrician right away. It'd be like my house is broken, right? But that's what Wi-Fi is like for a lot of us
[36:47.800 --> 36:51.120]  because we have one Wi-Fi router and
[36:51.800 --> 36:52.960]  it
[36:52.960 --> 36:59.920]  Reached some places doesn't reach others. Why era was designed to change all this the company manufactures right now a single device
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.900]  It is a small elegant box about the size of an Apple TV with the sort of Apple TV like
[37:06.200 --> 37:12.400]  Round corners and it's nice and white and it's kind of it's really a nice little beautiful little box
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.080]  It's very simple very small and the idea is you get a couple of them their default pack comes with three
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.500]  You can get four you can get five you get however many you need
[37:21.800 --> 37:29.120]  But the idea is just you put them around your house and they form what they call a mesh network where the eros talk to
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.680]  Each other and then they fill your whole house
[37:32.320 --> 37:34.320]  with distributed Wi-Fi and
[37:34.640 --> 37:41.000]  You don't have to sit there and and be like a network manager and configure this you don't sit there and pick
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.760]  channels and
[37:42.760 --> 37:47.720]  Frequencies and and stuff like that. All you have to do is just
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.920]  with common sense put them in the rooms where you're actually going to use them and
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.200]  where there might be walls between you know, the one that's connected to your
[37:59.920 --> 38:01.240]  cable modem
[38:01.240 --> 38:07.740]  That's all you have to do. They have a great app you manage the whole thing from an app on your iPhone
[38:07.740 --> 38:11.060]  It couldn't be easier. It's got a great interface
[38:12.380 --> 38:14.800]  They have incredible customer support, too
[38:15.340 --> 38:21.500]  This is something that the company has really invested in you can call and get a hold of a real Wi-Fi expert
[38:21.500 --> 38:25.740]  Not like a robot but like a human being who you know
[38:25.740 --> 38:30.700]  a lot of people you can set up these arrows and you never have you just plug them in and I'll just work if they
[38:30.700 --> 38:36.660]  Do encounter a problem if there's something weird about your setup if there's something weird about your house
[38:36.660 --> 38:41.820]  You can call them up and within 30 seconds. You can get a real person at ero on the phone
[38:42.660 --> 38:49.060]  It's a great product. I've got them set up here. My Wi-Fi has never been better in the house than when I've had ero
[38:50.620 --> 38:55.180]  It's currently rated 4.4 stars on Amazon with a whopping 750 reviews
[38:55.180 --> 39:01.580]  It offers a one-year warranty and it will work with your existing modem and internet service
[39:01.580 --> 39:09.580]  So this is really great. Go to ero.com. Remember the promo code the talk show all one word the

[39:13.560 --> 39:15.560]  expedited shipping
[39:16.020 --> 39:21.420]  Just pause the podcast right now go to ero.com. Remember that code the talk show and
[39:22.300 --> 39:27.920]  You'll have these things like tomorrow or maybe the next day with free expedited shipping and you set them up in your house

[39:29.580 --> 39:36.820]  So my thanks to them. It's a great product. I'm using them right now. You're hearing me talk to Ben over ero Wi-Fi routers
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.140]  Couldn't work better
[39:41.880 --> 39:43.880]  What else is on the agenda Ben
[39:44.340 --> 39:51.420]  Well, I mean ero is I guess the the go-to recommendation now because Apple doesn't make routers anymore. Well, they
[39:53.220 --> 39:55.960]  They sell them they don't that arguably
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.360]  It seemingly don't make new ones and then according to
[40:00.800 --> 40:04.860]  Scoop german they've canceled making new ones. So who knows?
[40:06.040 --> 40:08.040]  Scoop german, that's good
[40:08.260 --> 40:10.260]  She's calling that from now on
[40:10.540 --> 40:13.880]  Who knows what the hell's going on with them with that? I don't know. So I
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.320]  I'm I did want to talk to you about this because I haven't really found I've kind of mentioned it in passing
[40:19.480 --> 40:22.760]  In a day up here too, but I'm really found a good occasion like write about it doesn't
[40:22.760 --> 40:28.360]  Just like I don't write about like my whole thing is that we're about products or I'd like business models and stuff like that
[40:28.840 --> 40:30.840]  but I find
[40:30.920 --> 40:32.920]  the a lot of the
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.320]  Mac angst to be both
[40:37.680 --> 40:43.480]  Understandable. I think I get where it's coming from and also to be way overwrought and over-the-top and
[40:44.400 --> 40:50.060]  Not not necessarily connected to reality the Mac angst meaning in a nutshell
[40:50.060 --> 40:53.780]  Apple clearly doesn't care about the Mac anymore
[40:53.780 --> 41:00.140]  they want everybody to just use iPads and iPhones and they're doing everything they can to undermine the Mac and
[41:02.300 --> 41:05.180]  Within a year to be gone in five years, it'll be gone. Yeah, it'll be gone
[41:07.420 --> 41:09.420]  Yeah, well, I think the
[41:10.460 --> 41:15.340]  Obvious, it's all crescendoed with the release of the MacBook Pro which much to my
[41:15.340 --> 41:21.880]  My great sadness and consternation did not come with a Apple branded monitor
[41:21.880 --> 41:23.880]  Which I was looking forward to buying very much
[41:24.480 --> 41:27.080]  and and so and then obviously there was the
[41:27.160 --> 41:30.100]  You know people play about the memory they played about how the battery life off
[41:30.100 --> 41:32.080]  Then it was the port situation all that
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.540]  But I think that was just that just happened to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.200]  Because what was so weird about the MacBook Pro?
[41:41.200 --> 41:49.160]  being the trigger for all this angst is that the MacBook Pro is the single best piece of evidence that Apple is still investing in
[41:49.160 --> 41:55.240]  The map I mean say what you will at the touch bar and whether it's gonna actually be something that makes using a Mac better
[41:55.240 --> 42:02.480]  Or not. I think that will remain to be seen over the long run, but it clearly required a tremendous amount of investment and effort
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.180]  which
[42:04.180 --> 42:08.580]  Presuming Apple is a rationally run company and by all accounts
[42:08.580 --> 42:11.340]  The complaints are app is that Apple is being too rationally run
[42:11.480 --> 42:16.840]  They would not make that investment if they're gonna abandon the damn platform. So so it I
[42:17.360 --> 42:24.200]  We can get into why the angst is there but it's it's really kind of ironic that it happened around this particular product it I
[42:24.960 --> 42:30.120]  I'm with you and I don't know how better to make my case. I got a
[42:31.400 --> 42:37.160]  I wouldn't say a friend but a source somebody I've known for years who's worked at Apple and I hear from
[42:37.160 --> 42:43.240]  occasionally and like many people who are longtime Apple employees seems to you know
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.120]  Every 18 months or so moves around within the company to different teams
[42:49.480 --> 42:55.020]  Worked on a certain aspect of touch bar support. It was a software side thing
[42:56.320 --> 43:01.720]  For a while and then right after it shipped in like, you know, like maybe like three days
[43:01.720 --> 43:07.560]  I you know, I like a DM conversation with him and he was and one of the things he said is
[43:07.560 --> 43:13.660]  I hope this puts the rest of the notion that we don't that Apple doesn't care about the Mac because this is a good guy
[43:13.660 --> 43:15.660]  I spent like 18 months working
[43:16.720 --> 43:23.520]  It was hardware and a custom chip it has a display it hadn't used in that the software support was incredible
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.360]  Right all their apps had it built in they had all these frameworks develops where third-party developers could use it. Like it was a
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.360]  multi-faceted
[43:32.200 --> 43:39.240]  You know effort that involved every single part of the company so that that trigger that Apple doesn't care about the back is is again
[43:39.240 --> 43:45.160]  Again, I think there were justifiable reasons for the angst but it was just bizarre that this was the triggering event
[43:45.840 --> 43:47.840]  right you I
[43:48.240 --> 43:49.320]  I
[43:49.320 --> 43:54.800]  Will listen to you and and maybe you know nod my head in agreement if you say I'm not
[43:55.200 --> 43:57.480]  Happy with the direction. They're taking the Mac
[43:57.480 --> 43:59.480]  I
[44:00.040 --> 44:07.440]  If your argument is Apple then Tim Cook don't care about the Mac period and they're letting it wither because they're done with it I
[44:08.360 --> 44:12.480]  Can't see it. I really can't it doesn't make any sense and like somebody else
[44:12.480 --> 44:20.480]  I I've had I've gotten more like the the reaction that reaction to the to these macbook pros really did drive a lot of sources
[44:20.480 --> 44:22.520]  Out of the woodwork at Apple
[44:22.520 --> 44:27.200]  Like I've heard just bits and pieces from a bunch of people who are so frustrated by the reaction
[44:27.200 --> 44:29.200]  and like
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.600]  One source who would be in a position to know I mean not super high but you know, somebody who would know
[44:38.600 --> 44:40.600]  Said that they literally spent
[44:40.960 --> 44:46.240]  quote-unquote hundreds of millions of dollars developing the new MacBook pros and that right
[44:47.160 --> 44:52.720]  They could have saved all of that by just putting updated Intel chips into the old
[44:53.400 --> 44:55.400]  macbook pro hardware like
[44:55.400 --> 44:56.600]  a
[44:56.600 --> 45:02.840]  Which would be like if so if like we waited this long and then new Mac MacBook pros came out in November or October
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.520]  whenever it was and they were just exactly like the old ones except they had
[45:08.800 --> 45:14.980]  New Intel chips and maybe they had the high gamut, you know high color gamut displays, but otherwise, you know
[45:15.640 --> 45:17.080]  visually and just
[45:17.080 --> 45:19.840]  distinguishable from them that would be further like
[45:20.800 --> 45:23.800]  Fodder for the conspiracy theory that the Mac is on the way out
[45:23.800 --> 45:28.000]  Right because they didn't do these to the minimum viable sort of right sort of thing
[45:28.040 --> 45:31.480]  but they literally spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing these they
[45:32.080 --> 45:35.680]  expect them to be like the foundation of the product line for
[45:36.560 --> 45:39.920]  years to come and yet people see this as proof that
[45:40.920 --> 45:43.880]  That they're they're trying to get everybody to buy iPads
[45:44.480 --> 45:50.340]  Right, and it's funny because like I mean even the MacBook Pro like there was a relatively long delay
[45:50.340 --> 45:56.280]  the last release of the MacBook Pro was in May of 2015 which and then
[45:56.580 --> 46:03.140]  That was the 15 inch the 13th was updated in March 2015. So to wait a you know, year and a half was a
[46:04.460 --> 46:09.300]  Relatively relatively long time, but it wasn't like an obscene amount of time, right?
[46:09.820 --> 46:11.420]  and and
[46:11.420 --> 46:17.780]  Before that it'd be no mid to mid 2014 wait 2013 early 2013 retina 2012 mid 2012
[46:17.780 --> 46:21.900]  So it's slowed down a little bit but I mean for all the things have been discussing eyes about Intel and stuff like that
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.900]  That's understandable and also developing the touch bar
[46:23.940 --> 46:29.440]  Presumably introduced delays right because they when you got your review units this that they did sent you the touch bar that unit
[46:29.740 --> 46:31.740]  Like a week later. No two weeks later
[46:33.060 --> 46:38.060]  So yeah, so the MacBook Pro has certainly been it's been fine all along
[46:38.060 --> 46:44.260]  The iMac has been fine all along although it wasn't updated this year, which I think, you know added to a little bit
[46:44.260 --> 46:48.660]  I mean clearly it seems to mostly come back to you know, the sort of
[46:49.460 --> 46:54.960]  MacBook Pro debacle and and that's why your point about the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the MacBook Pro
[46:54.960 --> 46:57.540]  I think it's actually a really really interesting and
[46:58.700 --> 47:06.400]  Telling point because they're not gonna necessarily make up that money on this version of the MacBook Pro, right?
[47:06.860 --> 47:09.020]  presumably they're gonna be using the touch bar in
[47:09.020 --> 47:14.860]  In for several generations of the MacBook Pro and hopefully on external keyboards and things like that
[47:15.180 --> 47:18.300]  Which means they will pay it off over time, right?
[47:18.300 --> 47:24.540]  And that's how like business works you make these massive upfront investments and then every you try to sell more units
[47:24.540 --> 47:26.140]  You could spread out those
[47:26.140 --> 47:28.540]  That investment over more and more units, right?
[47:28.540 --> 47:30.980]  and I the reason I think that's
[47:31.300 --> 47:36.400]  Really telling is I think it starts to get into what went wrong with the MacBook Pro or so
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.980]  It's a Mac Pro, but but if that's more of a sort of a really fascinating
[47:41.740 --> 47:47.100]  Screw-up that might have happened as opposed to in an abandonment of the entire platform
[47:47.140 --> 47:51.340]  Yeah, and and it you know, let's make it clear. I mean, let's not
[47:51.900 --> 47:58.980]  Brush it under the carpet that the fact is that the Mac Pro is a complete embarrassment to the company
[47:59.260 --> 48:03.420]  It's it. It's a debacle. It is absolutely
[48:03.420 --> 48:05.420]  Ridiculous that they're selling
[48:06.980 --> 48:12.940]  1100 or 1200 day at this point old computer at the same price with no updated components
[48:12.940 --> 48:15.780]  it's it it's clearly a disaster and
[48:16.620 --> 48:19.560]  It's not a great sign for the Mac as a platform
[48:20.580 --> 48:27.500]  But it I don't think you can extrapolate from it that the entire platform is has lost the company's attention
[48:27.500 --> 48:33.700]  Right. And so I this so to me this Mac Pro thing is again
[48:33.700 --> 48:37.300]  I don't write about products per se so I haven't really dug into it too much
[48:37.300 --> 48:40.760]  I did kind of touch on it a little bit in a daily update for Christmas
[48:40.760 --> 48:45.620]  But to me this Mac Pro thing is one of the most interesting untold stories about Apple right now
[48:46.140 --> 48:48.020]  like there's no
[48:48.020 --> 48:55.820]  like it's impossible to draw any conclusion beyond that there was a massive massive screw-up here and and I and
[48:55.820 --> 49:02.260]  My I mean do you want to theorize I have my theory. That's that's what podcasts are for
[49:03.020 --> 49:08.100]  so so my so the reason I mentioned that bit about the MacBook pros and all the investment that goes into it is
[49:08.860 --> 49:14.920]  When Apple the cost that it took to develop this new Mac Pro the trash can Mac Pro was certainly substantial
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.140]  Oh, you know hundreds of millions of dollars. I'm sure you know, maybe you know, maybe even more who knows and
[49:19.140 --> 49:26.300]  Apple would have counted on earning back that investment over not just this 2013 model
[49:26.340 --> 49:33.380]  But presumably a 2014 model 2015 model etc for probably like at least 10 years like they were probably planning on having this design. Yeah
[49:34.100 --> 49:37.700]  Or the my the better part of a decade at the very least, right?
[49:37.700 --> 49:42.400]  So my best guess is that this design is fundamentally flawed in some way
[49:42.400 --> 49:44.980]  I think it's only flawed in general because I don't I think
[49:44.980 --> 49:51.780]  It makes people buy stuff. They don't need necessarily and are we gonna do like this business, but but there's something from a business perspective
[49:51.820 --> 49:54.540]  That's fundamentally flawed about this model
[49:54.540 --> 50:01.460]  Maybe there's a super high failure rate and they're having to always return them and exchange them like that which totally destroys your margins
[50:01.460 --> 50:04.140]  that's possible, but the problem is if you
[50:04.660 --> 50:09.340]  dropped hundreds of millions of dollars into a design and it fails and
[50:09.740 --> 50:13.500]  You have to you have to decide what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna stick with it?
[50:13.500 --> 50:16.420]  Well, that's not an option. So are you gonna redesign it?
[50:16.420 --> 50:22.060]  But then you're gonna reinvest hundreds of millions of dollars into a market. That is pretty tiny
[50:22.060 --> 50:29.200]  the Mac Pro market is not a big market and and I think what my suspicion what happened is that this was a
[50:29.700 --> 50:32.140]  design that Apple felt they could not continue to make
[50:32.540 --> 50:37.300]  The problem was the Mac Pro market wasn't they had to eat
[50:37.540 --> 50:42.780]  hundreds of millions of dollars in losses because they didn't build enough because they abandoned the product and
[50:42.780 --> 50:47.540]  It wasn't it just they couldn't make the case to invest another
[50:48.260 --> 50:52.060]  let's say five hundred million dollars to build a new version and
[50:52.700 --> 50:57.300]  Now they're trying to like figure something out and you could say they should do it
[50:57.300 --> 50:58.740]  Do we have our well they should do it
[50:58.740 --> 51:02.660]  They should eat that cost because it's a halo product all that sort of thing, but I can certainly
[51:03.340 --> 51:07.500]  Sketch out a scenario where it just makes zero financial sense for them to go forward
[51:07.500 --> 51:12.900]  Basically this product doomed the entire line that that's my that's my best guess about what happened
[51:13.300 --> 51:19.380]  Yeah, I think it was you know, something along those lines has to be true, right? It has to be
[51:20.940 --> 51:25.780]  And I think that and then you can extrapolate from there and in a certain point
[51:26.300 --> 51:32.300]  Apple even as an institution and even as in my opinion a relatively straightforward
[51:32.300 --> 51:38.060]  Realistic institution they still have a
[51:42.300 --> 51:45.820]  Human side and and there's pride and ego involved and
[51:46.700 --> 51:52.300]  It logically if they were purely logical you could just say you know what it was a terrible mistake
[51:52.300 --> 51:54.300]  We're going right back to the old cheese grater
[51:55.380 --> 52:00.060]  Big box. Here you go. Here's a new Mac Pro with the old cheese grater and
[52:00.060 --> 52:07.980]  And updated, you know state-of-the-art Intel chips and and modern ports on the back and an 18 times Super Drive
[52:08.500 --> 52:10.500]  right and and
[52:11.140 --> 52:17.220]  There are tens of thousands of people waiting for new Mac Pro who would be like, thank you and they would be happy
[52:17.220 --> 52:22.940]  But Apple's not going to do that, you know, like and honestly, I think it at some level comes down to pride
[52:22.940 --> 52:28.020]  They're just not going to do it for pride alone, which you know is frustrating if you're the pro waiting for
[52:28.020 --> 52:30.020]  modern
[52:30.660 --> 52:35.120]  2016 or or honestly even 2015 level pro hardware
[52:36.260 --> 52:38.260]  here in the beginning of 2017
[52:38.900 --> 52:45.100]  But they're not going to do that. Like they really, you know in a figurative sense painted themselves in a corner with this
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.920]  yeah, absolutely, and I think well you winked to
[52:50.540 --> 52:51.900]  To a
[52:51.900 --> 52:59.360]  Really insightful article about this and someone making the point that the this that 2013 introduction was like Apple
[52:59.660 --> 53:05.100]  It was also pride. It was Apple's hubris seeing the best of them and like people are complaining. We're not innovating
[53:05.100 --> 53:07.220]  well, you know screw them look at this and
[53:08.040 --> 53:12.940]  you ended up with the design that was looked amazing was beautiful, but
[53:13.460 --> 53:19.540]  again, whether it was reliability or just the core architecture or whatever it was was was
[53:19.540 --> 53:27.180]  Fundamentally flawed again. We're speculating but was fundamentally flawed in in some way that had they
[53:28.060 --> 53:31.780]  Not set out to prove the world to the world that they could you know
[53:31.780 --> 53:38.900]  Innovate my ass might have come up with something a little more practical that would you know, pay itself off as
[53:39.740 --> 53:46.740]  As necessary to continue as a viable product and I I still firmly believe I think they were wait
[53:46.740 --> 53:50.500]  You know, it's a case of being way too far ahead of their time. I
[53:51.260 --> 53:57.580]  Still think that fundamentally it is the future of pro computing and I think that having a big box
[53:57.780 --> 54:02.340]  that you plug things into like internal drives and internal cards is
[54:03.380 --> 54:08.380]  the way things were but it's not the way the future and I think the way the future is a
[54:08.660 --> 54:15.620]  Smaller self-contained box that if you you do need to expand it for true pro reasons
[54:15.620 --> 54:20.100]  You're gonna expand on the outside through very high bandwidth
[54:20.100 --> 54:26.380]  I mean whether USB C and Thunderbolt 3 is is fast enough to be that or not
[54:26.380 --> 54:32.700]  I don't know. Maybe it's the next generation thing. But at some point I firmly believe that a pro hardware is
[54:33.140 --> 54:41.700]  just a simple small box and then the expansion will all be external and you just in with one simple thing that you plug in and
[54:41.700 --> 54:47.780]  There it goes you get enough power you get enough bandwidth that you don't need to open the box and put the thing inside
[54:48.220 --> 54:55.220]  because to me that the and you know, I've gotten pushback on this on on private channels and slack that we're on but I
[54:55.820 --> 54:58.900]  Whether the world is there right now in 2017 or not?
[54:58.900 --> 55:04.240]  I don't know, but I think I still think that's firmly where the future is. But this Mac Pro launched
[55:04.240 --> 55:11.760]  At the three or four was at 2013 2014 a long time ago long enough 2013 and the world wasn't there yet
[55:11.800 --> 55:15.080]  You know for all expansion to be on the outside
[55:15.080 --> 55:20.260]  I think it's the right design for the long term, but it wasn't the right design for then and it certainly isn't for now
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.080]  But yeah, well the other thing too is I feel like pro hardware
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.640]  Should be the most conservative though in some respects in the way it progresses. I mean there's in some aspects
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.920]  It can be faster pros will pay for it. They'll do the upgrades things like that
[55:33.920 --> 55:40.920]  But like especially when it comes to anything performance related because I think the the the Mac Pro has Thunderbolt 2
[55:41.480 --> 55:43.040]  which
[55:43.040 --> 55:44.320]  Thunderbolt 2
[55:44.320 --> 55:49.720]  I'm at camera rowdy lanes. It's PCI Express, but it has not very many lanes. And so
[55:50.240 --> 55:55.440]  You know, yeah, I think you're right. There was the idea wasn't necessarily wrong. The timing was wrong and
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.320]  You know, you know if they were to do the other thing too is I think this forcing people to buy to
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.960]  At least at the time high-end video cards and today you still have to pay like the high-end video cards, even though they're super obsolete
[56:06.960 --> 56:13.520]  Right, I think this had two big problems one is that video card technology is progressing much faster than processor technology
[56:13.760 --> 56:19.400]  Which means that the Mac Pro got older faster, right? Even like the processors in the Mac Pro are still
[56:20.800 --> 56:25.280]  Totally relatively viable today, right? They're not that far behind particularly in single-thread performance
[56:25.280 --> 56:31.480]  But the the GPUs are way behind and for a computer that's predicated on GPUs. That's a big problem
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.480]  And the other thing is you had people like developers in particular one to buy this. They don't need two GPUs
[56:36.480 --> 56:43.760]  They don't need a processing GPU per se or a high-end GPU for they just need a integrated GPU be totally fine for them
[56:43.760 --> 56:46.480]  And so if they were gonna do they're gonna really make it integrated
[56:46.480 --> 56:50.320]  I think they need to wait until they could get to a point where they could have a computer
[56:50.320 --> 56:53.520]  That's basically a processor and memory and like a boot drive
[56:53.520 --> 56:59.280]  And then once thunderbolt four or five comes along it can actually really saturate
[56:59.280 --> 57:05.680]  You know high-end graphics cards or the bus that then you need break those art those out to write you drop the cost by thousand
[57:05.680 --> 57:07.680]  Bucks, it becomes a much more
[57:08.200 --> 57:10.280]  You know computer that makes a lot more sense. Yeah
[57:10.920 --> 57:15.840]  So Mac Pro totally screwed not necessarily and in my opinion
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.680]  Definitely not in my opinion not indicative that the Mac platform as a whole is is
[57:21.680 --> 57:25.240]  screwed or painted in a corner the other thing I like to point out and
[57:25.800 --> 57:31.960]  It's as much proof as the MacBook pros the new ones with the touch bar that Apple hasn't lost interest
[57:32.800 --> 57:40.160]  institutionally in the Mac is the fact that the OS is still on a yearly annual upgrade schedule and there are pretty good upgrades and
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.880]  We'd all like it to be slower right if anything
[57:42.880 --> 57:49.040]  I would rather have them go to to a two-year schedule and spend entire years on just like fixing bugs and
[57:49.040 --> 57:52.080]  Spit and polish, you know as opposed to adding new features
[57:53.760 --> 57:59.040]  But it's it's on a much more vigorous upgrade schedule and rigorous and vigorous
[57:59.920 --> 58:07.040]  Than it was in the early years of the iPhone when they literally had to issue a press release saying we've we've had to delay
[58:07.040 --> 58:12.560]  The upgrade to Mac OS because we've pulled engineers to finish the iPhone OS, right?
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Yeah, that is been this way for a long time
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.120]  Yeah, I think that in the in the other day, too
[58:19.120 --> 58:25.040]  I mean, yes, there's like the the Swift playgrounds or whatever on on the iPad
[58:25.040 --> 58:28.880]  But I mean like I mean Apple Apple's like they're not stupid, right?
[58:28.880 --> 58:34.480]  I mean, it's we will probably tell the app store in a little bit and there's lots of things to complain about Apple's
[58:35.280 --> 58:42.000]  Treatment of developers from a business perspective. I certainly have plenty of opinions in that regard but from a
[58:42.000 --> 58:46.720]  development perspective, I mean Apple's been, you know has always been
[58:47.600 --> 58:52.640]  very cognizant of what its developers need and whatnot and to suggest that they're going to
[58:53.040 --> 58:58.640]  abandon the platform that that makes their their money makers possible. I mean, it's
[59:00.080 --> 59:04.000]  It's as it's describing it. It just doesn't make sense
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.920]  Like there there is a an Occam's razor explanation here, which is that it's a it's a it's a
[59:09.920 --> 59:14.560]  Occam's razor explanation here, which I think explains the Mac Pro it explains
[59:15.200 --> 59:19.200]  Why it's not updated explains why there's probably not going to be another Mac Pro
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.200]  Because you can I could sketch it on a spreadsheet right now. Why it probably makes zero sense to build another one
[59:24.000 --> 59:29.520]  And that sucks. It was a total screw-up. Hopefully someone will write the tell article. Sometimes it'd be really fascinating to
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.480]  To get the full story of when Apple just really did totally screw up a product
[59:35.120 --> 59:36.080]  but
[59:36.080 --> 59:40.480]  Yeah to extrapolate from that. There's just it doesn't make sense. No
[59:45.360 --> 59:50.320]  I'm still irritated about the no Apple logo display though. Yeah, that is
[59:52.160 --> 59:57.360]  And it's true because it's not just a product for Mac Pro users it
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.120]  I would guess that out over the years Apple has probably sold more standalone
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:09.940]  Displays to Mac Book Pro users than to Mac Pro users because I think the Thunderbolt display was pretty explicitly
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:17.060]  Marketed as a like the box itself has a Thunderbolt display attached to a laptop, right? Like it's pretty clear what it's for
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.340]  Yeah, I I
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:26.260]  I would be shocked if they've if there are more of them that were hooked up to Mac pros than to MacBook pros and and
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:31.700]  That's saying that knowing that most MacBook Pro users never use any display other than the one that's built into the laptop
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.820]  but even so I think that the the number of
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.020]  Laptops that are that are sold compared to desktops is so
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.940]  Extraordinarily lopsided and that most of those laptops that are sold or iMacs that have a built-in display
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.100]  I think it's so lopsided that it's clearly meant for that
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:59.860]  And so it is disappointing and and it does seem from early going that people who've bought this LG the LG 5k display
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:05.380]  some of them love it, but there are people people are having weird problems with it
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:12.340]  Yeah, I had somebody I didn't link to it and it's so anecdotal but somebody wrote in to Daring Fireball
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.540]  I mean, it's a perfect podcast material, but so I won't write about it
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.460]  but I'll talk about it where somebody wrote in and they had problems and
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:27.620]  Had like weird interference and they were taking it into the store and then they couldn't reproduce it at the Genius Bar
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.460]  and you know, just imagine what a pain in the ass it is to bring a
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.500]  27-inch display back and forth to an Apple Store
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.860]  Etc. And it turned out that moving
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.340]  He had his airport router
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:48.100]  He had an Apple Airport router on his desk and moving it away from his desk fixed the interference on the fly LG 5k display
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:52.340]  That literally, you know, and he said it's you know, I need you know, again
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.460]  I I'm not gonna write about it because it's like one guy with one case and I don't know but I've seen other people with
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:01.460]  These interference, you know with with weird problems on this and like what a weird problem
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.580]  but it's like it's the sort of thing that a normal person is never gonna figure out if if if it turns out that's for
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:12.020]  Whatever reason having their airport router too close to the display causes it to have weird
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.860]  Interference, how is a normal person gonna figure that out?
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:22.500]  And it's the sort of thing that Apple the Apple's Apple branded displays or but they're not just aesthetically pleasing
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:28.420]  They really are just terrific displays always have always were I can't say they are they are tanks
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.340]  I mean the I actually have mine sitting on my desk
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.500]  uh because not using one of those mounts because I couldn't it it it
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.420]  Weighs like five times as much as a normal monitor of similar size
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.540]  So i'm guessing that's probably why it handles the shielding better
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:48.740]  But uh, but yeah, I mean it's one of those things I I could never understand why you would pay so much for a monitor
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.140]  Until I had a job that bought one for me
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.540]  And it was like, oh, okay. I get it now. I I will never not buy another one of these again
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:02.740]  and now my thunderball display is failing and uh, and I can't buy another one and i'm very sad I had a 20-inch
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.460]  I I don't know what the name was, but it was
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.580]  I couldn't at the time when I bought it. I couldn't get a bigger one
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.020]  I think there was it was like 20 and 23s and I bought the 20-inch
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:16.660]  I mean it was probably like 2000 or something like that the plastic framing and like the the two way
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.980]  No, it had it was aluminum. It had an aluminum frame
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:25.700]  Uh, I had it and I had it. I mean I went through like three or four max while I was using it and you know
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.820]  I'm sure it was
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.540]  More or less like when I finally got rid of it. It wasn't because it was broken. It was just like I I
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.460]  I think I used it up until I got this 20. Yeah, I probably had it on my desk until I got this 27-inch
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.460]  Imac two and a half years ago
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.900]  It it just ran and ran and ran. It was unbelievable
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:50.580]  Yeah, my my monitor works fine. It's the uh, the USB all that stuff
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:57.220]  No longer works or it works very sketchily and so that i've been using that for like the camera and also I had all my stuff
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.340]  Plugged into it. So now I do the laptop and I move around a lot
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.220]  And so every time I sit down to plug in like five things every single time and I have to use the sound for my laptop
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.060]  Speakers and yeah, so it's more the display itself is fine
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.340]  It's the it's the sort of docking capability that has gone
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.300]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our third. I'm sorry. Just a second
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:20.900]  I do think though the other the one thing that is worth as long as we're here because abandoning the
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.020]  The apple display we start at the airport thing
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:29.860]  this stuff I think does fit more in the kind of critique of apple as being
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:38.580]  You know to quote-unquote spreadsheet driven or operational driven or whatever the the critique is of of sort of tim cook and apple
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:44.020]  Generally, and I think that is a fair one because the what that gets into is um, you know
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.020]  Apple never sold routers to make money on routers
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:53.300]  they sold routers because it would ensure that the experience of using your apple device was better than it would be
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.860]  than it would be otherwise and
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:01.220]  You know same thing with with the display you didn't apple didn't sell display because they were going to make money on displays
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.620]  Well, they probably made money given how much they charge for them
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:09.300]  But it kind of like it lets you be a you know, it kind of lets you some respects. It was a better experience
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.300]  That's true. But also having that big tank on your desk with the apple logo on it
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.900]  I mean it it lets you be an apple person in some respects and I think that part
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.940]  That that to me that is more concerning in a way because it's
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:29.860]  Apple is making decisions that are driven by it seems like anyway, they're making this is driven by
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.700]  the bottom line not driven by this sort of
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:39.860]  Halo sort of thinking about what it means to be an apple customer if that makes sense take a step back tape
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.100]  take a deep breath and just
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500]  Be there as a customer
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:49.220]  And see what the overall experience is like and again to draw an analogy I make it over and over and over again
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:54.420]  But just to to compare apple to disney and you go to a disney theme park you go to any other theme park
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.740]  And you buy a new one
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:01.700]  Park you go to any other theme park and you buy a hot dog and a soda
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.140]  And then when you're done with it
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:08.340]  You go to the trash can and the trash can is like filled to the brim overflowing and it's like what do you do?
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.420]  Do you like kind of rest the thing on top?
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.860]  What do you do with your garbage when the trash can is already full?
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:19.940]  You go to a disney theme park and the trash cans are never full because they spend the money to have people
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.500]  constantly emptying
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.140]  The trash cans so that they're always and and they're never filthy
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:31.540]  You never feel like you're grossed out by like putting your garbage in there
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:40.420]  It just works right it you just the and it's such a little thing to have garbage cans that are not full and not
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:46.020]  Covered with grime and you can just always throw your trash away
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.380]  That's what having
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:54.660]  apple branded wi-fi routers was like back in the day where it was like, you know,
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:59.380]  They didn't need to make them you could you know buy netgear or whatever other ones there were
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:04.020]  But the fact that you could just go in the apple store if you needed to and just say just give me you know
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.780]  I got to set up wi-fi in my house
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.900]  Tell me what to buy and you buy it and go home and hook it up and it would work
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:15.140]  Uh, it was the same sort of thing. It wasn't about making money for the company. It was like look you're an apple customer
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.620]  It's gonna you know, we'll take care of you
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.220]  Yep
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.020]  It doesn't matter whether we're making money on this or not, right?
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.340]  Do you really does you know?
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:31.220]  Would disney theme parks make less money if they cut their number of people emptying the trash cans in half?
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.300]  Probably not or at least not for a long time. It would take a while for it to show up
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.980]  but
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.100]  You know, it's just part of the experience, you know that you can do it
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.820]  Right and and and if that feels like the part that is
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.820]  Is
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:52.980]  That's the concerning part that's more like the mac pro like I really feel like there's a business explanation for it that you can make
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.300]  the
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.860]  and it's it's one of those ones where it's just you know, I
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.020]  It's one of the I can see it being a hard decision, but it's just gonna have to be made the router
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:09.140]  In this case, it's like the business decision is like too obvious. Like it's like it's very clear like this is a distraction
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.740]  We're not making money blah blah blah whatever it might be. But yeah, it's
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:18.100]  It is it's hard to explain that away as anything other than focusing on
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.060]  resources and margins
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:26.740]  And not focusing on the experience because I I just I even today as things are have gotten better
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.860]  but I don't know how you can say that we are focused on delivering the best possible experience and
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:37.220]  Be in becoming these peripherals. I mean again if you take take the experience holistically and yeah
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:41.220]  You can go to apple store and say oh my computer's wi-fi isn't working. Oh, it's probably that it's probably a bad router
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220]  like
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.460]  That yes, is that apple's fault no, maybe not but does that make their customer's life
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:55.060]  More challenging it does and it's a shame that they're they they seem to not care about that as much
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.180]  Yeah, I totally agree
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:03.620]  I kind of feel it's like they're they're the problem isn't that they don't care about the mac period
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.700]  the
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.700]  it's kind of
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:13.860]  Like which would be alarming and i've said this before too. Like I am a die-hard mac user like like if I had to choose
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.580]  between
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.060]  Only ever using
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:24.820]  Ios devices or only ever using mac os devices as much as I love my iphone
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:30.420]  I would rather switch to an android phone and have a mac to work
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:37.700]  Than to have an iphone and ipad and use anything else at my desk for work because it's that that's how much the mac
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:42.260]  means to me in terms of my workflow for working if I didn't if I like
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:49.140]  Somehow retired or if I you know, I don't know became a lumberjack whatever else I would do as a career
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:57.380]  And didn't work in a way that I that I use the mac I I would rather have an iphone I guess, you know
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:03.540]  Well, I know I would rather have an iphone and I guess I would choose that to use ios over mac period but because my work
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:08.420]  Is at a computer the mac means that much to me. That's how much
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:17.940]  And so I I care about this profoundly whether apple cares but the way I see it is not so much that apple is is
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.780]  Like moving away from the mac, but more or less that apple is just
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:26.660]  Giving the mac shit work, you know, like almost like they're taking advantage of the mac
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.300]  I mean, that's okay though
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.220]  I mean, I think the the point that people are kind of vaguely aware of but you know
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:38.020]  Certainly front and center to me being on this side of the world in asia is that you know?
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.700]  here
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:45.860]  People kind of skipped over pcs in some respects and and so that makes mobile really interesting because the way people use mobile here
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.860]  is just way more in depth and
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:52.500]  Pervasive than it is in in the states where everyone had a computer at one point people still use computers
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.420]  out of habit
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:11:00.020]  and so and and that's where app the growth is for apple and apple does make the vast majority of their money on the iphone and
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:06.420]  You know and the ipad is is you know the future and you see your kids use these devices and all that sort of thing
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:11.460]  I totally get it and it's totally a totally valid thing to thing to say but that's also where the
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.220]  the
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:20.020]  the router thing is particularly interesting because the router is just as important to the iphone as it is to
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.500]  And I guess the iphone can fall back on on cellular networking
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.060]  Maybe they think that home wi-fi is going to go away and again, I guess you think about it in emerging markets
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:32.260]  It is more the case that you may not have home wi-fi, but you do use wireless and maybe that maybe that's it
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:39.780]  Maybe that is you know, this is just looking forward to the future and the way things are but uh, but yeah
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.300]  it I mean, I guess that's the other thing too is like the
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:50.260]  You you talked about the the mac pro evolution like putting in a new set of processors and updated screens
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.900]  Would have sounded great to me
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:59.300]  I mean in some respects. It's almost like this weird. It's like this weird codependent relationship between apple
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:05.860]  You mean the macbook users macbook pro. Yeah, sorry macbook pro like I mean macbook macbook
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:11.860]  Apple is like we need to support the mac. You're right. It's the it's it's the truck quote unquote
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:17.700]  We're gonna dump all our shitty work on it and whatnot and we'll macbook pro users like that's fine
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.020]  All we want to do is like do our shitty work. Just give us just give us updated internals
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.340]  We'll be totally happy but I was like no we need to update it. We need to innovate it
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:31.940]  It's like this weird sort of like this weird sort of relationship between the two sides
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.940]  That that is kind of weird. That's all I can say. It's weird
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.220]  All right. Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor. It's a good friends at casper
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:44.580]  Casper makes an obsessively engineered mattress
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.940]  And they sell them at shockingly fair prices go to casper.com slash the talk show
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:55.780]  And use code the talk show all one word the talk show and save 50 bucks
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500]  Towards your mattress
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:03.780]  Casper has engineers mattress engineers. These are engineers who only work on designing mattresses
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.740]  And they've designed one perfect mattress
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.820]  it is a combination of memory foam and
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.660]  Other technologies
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:23.540]  The bottom line is it's just one type of mattress you don't have to go there and pick between
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:30.340]  This style that style whatever you just pick a size you just pick a size it comes to your house in a little box
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.660]  Shockingly small box because it's made out of foam. They they sort of vacuum steal it
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.780]  It's worth buying one of these mattresses just to get the box in your house to see how small
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.340]  A box they can put an entire like king or queen size mattress in
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:49.620]  You open it up in the room don't open it up before you get it to your bedroom
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:55.940]  Trust me read the bot instructions on the box. You don't want to do that. Uh, you open it up and you have a beautiful mattress
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:00.500]  It's right there. It makes a great sound. It sucks all the oxygen out of the air as it fills up
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:06.740]  And it's great. I have one it is terrific. It's like sleeping in a luxury hotel every night
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.380]  And here's the thing like all these other companies that sponsor these podcasts
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.460]  It sounds too good to be true, but the the reason it's so good is because it's so easy to do
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:24.580]  Good to be true. But the the reason it works is that they sell directly the reason mattresses cost so much in other places
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:31.780]  Is that there's the whole middleman thing where from the factory to your bedroom? There's all of this markup
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:40.340]  As it goes through the retail channel and the expense of having like a big retail showroom where you walk around and try
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:46.900]  Six different styles of mattress from different companies and it's gross because all these other people have like jumped
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:49.460]  On the bed to try it out
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.620]  Casper takes all that away
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:58.500]  You buy it. It shows up at your house. You have a hundred night home trial and if you don't love it
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:02.020]  They will pick it up at your house and give you a full refund
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.700]  You don't even have to pay to ship it back
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.220]  You just get all your money back and they just take it away if you don't like it
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:13.300]  they can do this because they know that people who buy them they don't take it up on them because it's a great mattress hundred
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.780]  Night home trial so you don't have to worry about the fact that you're buying a mattress online without actually trying it
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:23.060]  So next time you need a mattress or if you don't even if you think hey
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.180]  Maybe my mattress is old and gross and it's you know, it's kind of worn out
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:31.980]  Just go there get a new one and you'll sleep better. What's better than sleep? I love to sleep
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:38.060]  So go to casper.com slash the talk show remember that code the talk show and you will say 50 bucks
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.740]  Towards your mattress go there and try it out
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.700]  Love this sponsor cannot believe can't still cannot believe
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.260]  That my career has ended up where I'm a mattress pitchman. I
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:58.500]  Swear to god this my favorite one of my all-time favorite sponsors and during fireball slash the talk show history is Casper just because I
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.940]  You know like when Squarespace sponsors the show I told you if you would have told me ten years ago
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:07.620]  Hey, you know ten years from now you're gonna be pitching like a service where you can set up your own website
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.460]  I can think like hey, that's great. That's sort of what I was hoping I would end up doing. That's great
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:15.560]  If you had told me I would be selling mattresses. I just would be like are you serious?
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.380]  But here I am
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.260]  All right, what else is going on how about this Chris Latner story
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.460]  so Chris Latner creator of
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.140]  LLVM compiler
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.980]  C Lang
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:41.340]  the original engineer behind Swift he kind of worked on Swift for like a year or two before
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:47.380]  Showing it to his teammates at Apple and then it was like a small team that worked on it sort of you know
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:54.380]  Yeah fairly said the father of Swift has left Apple and is joining Tesla and within a week or two
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:59.900]  And a couple of other people, I mean there's sort of
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.740]  I
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.940]  Wouldn't call it
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.180]  Like a couple of people have written to me and said like wow
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.780]  You're linking to all these people who are leaving Apple for Tesla
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:12.780]  Does this mean that there's like this huge brain drain going on where?
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.340]  All the talent from Apple is leaving for Tesla and that's I don't think that's the case and I've asked around
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.580]  I I don't I just think it's a couple of high-profile cases
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.820]  But I do think there's more people leaving Apple for Tesla than leaving Tesla for Apple
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.860]  Yeah, and you know, it's it's
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.020]  It's hard to say I mean in some respects
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:41.300]  I mean the what what Latner has accomplished is incredible and I think if you don't really
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:45.820]  know about and most Apple customers have no need to know about sort of the
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.140]  developer toolchain, it's it's hard to appreciate the
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.940]  The contribution this guy has made to Apple. I mean like and the stature the stature that he has in the industry
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.980]  I mean, it's very hard to say, you know, who else is like Chris Latner?
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:05.180]  I mean, he's sort of a singular figure in terms of what he's accomplished and what he's done. I mean
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.020]  You know, absolutely
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.540]  I mean in the the entire like LLVM like
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:14.940]  Architecture and now like clang is kind of a part of that now that that's the front end compiler that you know
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.940]  It's it's one. It's totally taken over the industry
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:24.100]  I mean and for one and for two, it's a
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.540]  Yeah, I mean so for one just the impact broadly it's widely adopted. It's used everywhere
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.860]  There's all sorts of custom toolchains there bill on top of it
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:38.340]  It supports all sorts of things and then it LLVM is sort of a broader architecture clang is for C type languages
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.700]  But primarily so it's a narrower sort of thing that sits on top of it
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:47.420]  But the other thing I mean just from a so from an industry perspective it absolutely spot-on like this guy's a giant in the field
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:53.260]  I mean, like like Richard Stallman like level like there's no one is a GCC or whatever like this and kind of his
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:56.940]  It's not respects his successor in that sort of Linus Torvalds
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.780]  You know
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:04.300]  There's only a handful of people you can compare to Latner and for some reason all the other ones are a bunch of assholes and
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.860]  Latner is a really nice guy
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740]  right
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.020]  So so yeah, he's the absolute giant and then for Apple
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:17.540]  I mean it the the way I mean Apple talks about wanting to own their primary technologies, right?
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:18.100]  Yeah
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:24.540]  like what Latner did was made it possible for Apple to not only own its
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:29.140]  Developer tool stack in a way they didn't before and they were at the mercy of third parties
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.820]  like your whole Metro works and code warrior and all like all that sort of like stuff and and
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.620]  they they end up owning the entire stack and
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:41.260]  He did it in a way that is like the best of Apple strategy
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:46.460]  I talked about the commoditizing the compliments part right what Apple like people thought Apple being this in a being integrated
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:51.580]  Right because they do the OS and the hardware if you think about the hardware Apple is very modular, right?
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.580]  Apple's like 600 suppliers or something like that all over the world building all these pieces
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.620]  Competing against each other to get the lowest possible price Apple can dual source suppliers, etc, etc
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:06.220]  And and so Apple reaps all the benefits of having this massive ecosystem
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:12.940]  making their products better on an individual component basis and then Apple fuses it all together into one thing and ties it to the software and
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:17.100]  Says oh look we're integrated and they are it just everyone's integrated different parts of the stack
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:21.100]  Like that's what Latiners work what Apple do on the developer side?
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:25.660]  Yeah, like there is a massive community that is working on LVM
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:31.260]  That's working on Clang that now is working on Swift. It's a part of it being open source and you have they're working
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.020]  They're making it better. They're contributing patches
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.020]  They're building up new languages new use cases
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:40.620]  Making a more attractive language for students to learn so that new students come along who already know Swift and can code on Apple's platforms
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:47.900]  like there's all these benefits that accrue to all this stuff being open source and being the standard for all kinds of things that
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:53.100]  It all accrues to Apple's benefit because it's going into their core technology and then Apple owns
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:57.100]  Into their core technology and then Apple owns the top and the bottom parts of it, right?
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.140]  They own how it ties into to their platforms
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:06.060]  They own the IDE that you have to use Xcode to to at you know at some step to compile, you know
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.620]  you know iOS apps or whatnot and
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.220]  And so from a strategic and business perspective his contribution is massive
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:18.860]  It's absolutely massive and it's it's equal to someone like the more famous folks
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:26.300]  You see like Ivan Ivan industrial design or the people in the software stack or in the hardware the the the chip stack like building
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:30.460]  A custom thing for Apple it it's difficult to overstate the contribution
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:36.300]  He's made both the industry and to Apple and their sort of strategic position going forward. Yeah, I'll probably
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.500]  Miss this because I wasn't directly involved but Apple's
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.980]  Developer tools are incredibly important to a platform
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:51.100]  It's hard to overstate that and it's one of those things that Microsoft has aced
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:57.500]  I I think from the very earliest days and through to the current day like say what you want
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.820]  About using their platform as a user. I I still I find Windows 10 to be
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:10.380]  As unpalatable as ever but their developer tool story has always been top-notch and from everything from the compiler to debugger to
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500]  You know the the languages
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500]  The languages
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.380]  And Apple really
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.700]  missed out on that
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:26.060]  Back in the early days, you know, there was the the Macintosh developer tools was it was called
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.500]  MPW Macintosh programmers workshop
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:37.340]  And it was this sort of weird for the Mac perspective hybrid it was sort of like a
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:39.980]  command line shell
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.980]  that
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.700]  On a system that didn't have a terminal or didn't have a command line when you ran MPW
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.260]  There was a shell and it had its own shell scripting language
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:55.580]  And I remember I used to have a version of Perl that you could run in MPW
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:58.860]  It was you know, like people would say like, oh you can't run Perl on a Mac
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.740]  Well, you could if you had MPW and there was also a thing called Mac Perl
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:08.060]  Which was a standalone application and the way you would run scripts in MP and I mean, this is really way out in the weeds
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.060]  But you could send it like an Apple event
[01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.580]  It sent like an Apple script command to Mac Perl with the the
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:19.740]  Perl script file you wanted to run and then it would send you the results so you could run Perl on a classic Mac
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.460]  Even though it didn't have anything resembling a traditional
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:25.100]  Unix command line
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.260]  But eventually this became outdated and by the mid mid 90s
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:36.460]  Just about every serious Mac developer I knew was using code warrior, which was a third-party
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:40.940]  IDE, right integrated development environment, right? So
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.940]  Instead of just putting scripts together to compile your app
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:52.060]  You'd have an actual visual thing and there was you know, the predecessors to to that were from a company called think
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:56.460]  There was think C and think Pascal which were very well regarded
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.980]  I I know people to this day who would who would argue that think Pascal's developer
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:09.500]  Was the best debugger they've ever used great products and it you know, and in a Mac style where you had these projects that were in
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.700]  A window and it was click and drag to organize the project
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.260]  With Mac OS 10
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:22.540]  What they inherited from next was the GCC toolkit
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.180]  Which again I mean we could go on for an hour about this and it's over, you know
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:33.660]  it's really outside my expertise, but you know GCC the best thing you could say about it was that it worked
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:39.020]  It was flexible and it worked and it had all the trade-offs that came with
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:44.860]  Working on everything and for everything right that you had to see C and C++ compiler
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:50.140]  That next had jerry-rigged over the years to also compile objective C
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:56.940]  Nobody was happy about it and I was at it. I mean it like during this transition period like this is
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.820]  It was a good time to work at a company like bare-bones like in 2000 to 2002 to like
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.380]  Talk to people, you know, like engine, you know
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.020]  back engineers who were like
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.420]  switching from
[01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:11.420]  Code warrior to to
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:18.300]  The GCC what was the xcode called before it was xcode? I forget what what was it project builder, right?
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.580]  Oh, yeah, that's right project builder and interface builder. Um
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:28.140]  You know and the the bare-bones engineers were great. I mean they were very, you know, they're they're
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:33.660]  Pragmatic as engineers should be where they had bb edit and they had a lot of work to do
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:36.700]  But they were able to do a lot of work and they were able to do a lot of work
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:42.380]  They're they're pragmatic as engineers should be where they had bb edit compiling under
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:49.180]  GCC long before they had to just to make sure that you know, the source code was going to pass through a different C compiler
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.220]  You know, but
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:56.080]  It was it was very crude and rudimentary. Whereas the whole llvm
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.980]  clang
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:04.700]  Clang stack is very much what apple would have if they could just snap their fingers and say we wish we had a toolkit
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:09.100]  That worked like this. That's pretty much what llvm is. I think it's fair to say
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:14.060]  Yeah, and llvm is this is really amazing. It's basically like it makes the entire
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.060]  Bottom part of the compiler like totally modular where you compile into this intermediary language
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.700]  And then it can recompile for particular processors or GPUs or whatever it might be
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:32.300]  but it made it totally modular instead of like basically GCC was like this spaghetti soup of stuff where to add on support for
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.220]  anything you would kind of
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:39.040]  Just add to the spaghetti like but a new kind of spaghetti and it was totally impenetrable
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:42.860]  and llvm made this very neat sort of modular approach and
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:49.180]  Later developed llvm to sit underneath GCC. So basically gcu just would just compile to the intermediate language
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.620]  But eventually yeah
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:54.540]  He built all the way up to the top of the stack to to do the entire compiler itself
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:27:01.340]  Which then let xcode do way more interesting things because apple now controlled the entire thing from from top to bottom. Um,
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.500]  yeah, that we
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:09.180]  we if we didn't bore people with the sports we just bored them with talking about compilers, but the the net of it is is that
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:14.220]  Not only is he super only guard in the industry, but he is important to apple
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:18.700]  like strategically like what he has done for apple is is
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.820]  Very few company very few people in the company can really can really match that
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:24.540]  Yeah
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:31.580]  And it one of the practical effects of of his work that really has an effect on apple is it made it
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:36.460]  Much easier for apple. I mean, I think they could have done it. Anyway, even if they were stuck on the GCC
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:43.740]  Toolchain they could have but I think it was I I don't think anybody would argue with the fact that it's easier for apple to
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.540]  Have you know?
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:53.980]  Things that run on arm things that run on intel have new, you know switched to new new arm 64 and stuff like that
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:58.060]  It it makes them less dependent on on
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:03.980]  The the specific hardware that they're targeting they can yeah when that yeah when that came out it was still GCC
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:11.100]  But yeah, but but I think the 64-bit transition is is a perfect example of where it just got way easier for them
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.700]  And in all future changes will be much easier. Yeah
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:21.500]  Like they can go to something in the future. That's not there yet and they don't it'll be easier they can you know, anyway
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:25.100]  Is it a problem? Is it a bad sign that latner has left?
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.380]  Is it a problem? Is it a bad sign that latner has left for?
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:33.020]  I mean latner himself. I mean latner himself. It's it's really hard to
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:38.780]  Take too much out of it. I mean the guy he was on the ATP podcast, uh
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:45.820]  Which was accidental tech podcast, which was great. Um, absolutely and terrific. I I i've linked to it
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.620]  And i'll just say I mean if you haven't listened to it
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.420]  Uh, it was terrific and for a show where they almost never have
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.420]  guests, uh
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.260]  the
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:01.740]  He's really the idealized ATP guest yeah, the three of them did a great job, uh
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:08.380]  As hosts of outside guests good questions kept the conversation going covered just about everything
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.860]  I hope that they would cover it was really really a terrific show
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.980]  Yeah, and what you really get from him and if you look at his career, you can see this
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:20.380]  I mean the guys developed LVM as a graduate student and then
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:25.740]  Apple gave him the the opportunity care to completion. He did ceiling or clay. He's a ceiling or clang. Uh
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.700]  I clang
[01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.700]  Yeah, I say clang. Uh, I mean he initiated that and carried to completion
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:37.740]  He initiated swift basically on on his own like this is a guy that likes to take on
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.460]  hard and difficult problems from
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:45.900]  First principles. Yeah and figure them out and you know right now the
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:51.980]  Core, like Apple's sort of development stack is set for the next 20 years. Basically. I mean
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:59.420]  There's lots of work to do on Swift. It's not finished but like the conceptual portion of Swift is finished, right?
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:05.180]  Now it's like problem solving and implementation by and large and I can totally see for a guy like this like
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:12.940]  What what's left right? He he's built out the Apple's entire developer stack from literally from top to bottom
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:18.460]  And what's left for him, you know, and you have this opportunity with Tesla
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:22.140]  I mean, it's it's you know, this who knows what he's gonna do
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:29.980]  I mean Tesla's Tesla is built currently at an Nvidia stack where Nvidia has this has this setup where you can basically use their GPUs for general processing
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.620]  And if they have it, it's built on LVM
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:40.940]  Nvidia has their own implementation of it's called an NVM or something like that and but I mean and Tesla also hired one of Apple's original a chip designers
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:47.980]  Last year and I you got to imagine they might be coming with something totally custom and integrated on both sides
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:54.140]  I don't know. It's fun to speculate but I can totally see why someone like Latner who has a
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:03.180]  Remarkable history of solving really hard problems from first principles just wouldn't have anything left for him at Apple and
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.220]  and and there is something at Tesla and
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:12.300]  He's the guy who has not voted by my money. I'm sure Apple's made him rich beyond his wildest dreams without question
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:15.100]  You know, there's it's something deeper than that
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:15.500]  Yeah
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:23.820]  and at a certain level if he's just looking after his career in terms of if he's at Apple and he's in
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:27.260]  Software just in general let alone the toolkit or whatever
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.060]  I mean there's already
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:39.100]  Craig Federighi at the SVP spot, you know, I mean there's nowhere up for him to go at Apple whereas effectively
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:43.660]  I think he's now the Craig Federighi at Tesla. He is the head of software at Tesla
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:47.340]  so there's a company where there's an opening for a
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.740]  You know
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:57.420]  Reports directly to the CEO head of software whereas at Apple that position is not open and probably is not going to be open anytime soon
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:04.060]  One thing that is interesting is speaking of reporting the CEO is at least a few of the guys that have left the high-profile ones
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.300]  Were ones who did work with Steve Jobs?
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.860]  and it's almost like they're
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:10.860]  they
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.660]  you can get the sense that they kind of miss the
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:21.020]  This the fire for lack of a better word, you know, like it was brutal, but it was brutal in a like
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.620]  in a
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:28.460]  Very energizing sort of way. Um, which you're certainly gonna get I think with with Elon Musk
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:32.620]  I mean there there's a reason they compare they compare people compare the two
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.140]  Yeah, like one of the this isn't a new
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:42.860]  Poaching but
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.020]  Boss
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.900]  Ording I hope I'm pronouncing his first name, right but
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:55.740]  He left Apple in 2014 and as of March 2015, he was designing user interfaces at Tesla
[01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.500]  and
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.660]  I'd linked to this the other day, but he
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:05.180]  Well, he didn't it was before he went to Tesla but after he left Apple and
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:11.580]  He said why he left was one because he was spending a lot of time in court
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:17.180]  Defending patents and he was just like I don't know why he left
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.180]  Defending patents
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:23.180]  Because his name was listed on these patents and they're suing HTC and Samsung, etc
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.020]  And you know, it's
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.900]  It's not complicated. I mean he wanted to be designing user interfaces
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:36.700]  He did not want to be putting on a suit and tie and showing up in court and answering lawyers stupid questions about interfaces
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:41.580]  And then the other thing he said was I spent more time in court than designing aside from that
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:45.420]  I missed the interaction with Steve Jobs. We discussed matters every 14 days
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.420]  Yeah
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:52.060]  Yeah, it'd be I mean, you know, I the the reality is and
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.820]  You know, I I for all the great things that Apple has accomplished, you know
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.460]  I I tend to be a bit of a fatalist about things. I mean companies like people
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:05.020]  You know have life cycles. I mean they
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.060]  Apple came roaring back from the dead
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:13.420]  They they did the iPod which really just the company that led directly to the iPhone the iPhone
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.940]  Led directly to the iPad and and the Mac came along for the ride
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:23.020]  But I mean it it's a there was a very natural progression for Apple to reach the heights of me now
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:27.900]  I mean to be clear what's happened is extraordinary and Apple deserves all the praise and all their credit for what they've done
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:34.700]  but you know if you look back at the broad history of business in all sectors or whatever to
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:39.020]  you know, the reality is to presume that Apple is going to
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:45.340]  Make the next world-changing product is is for all the great products they made and I'm not doing that at all
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.460]  That really is to challenge like all of history and it's not an issue of you
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:54.140]  You don't make products because you really want to make products like Apple's not
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:35:00.620]  You know Apple Apple's filled with humans just like every other company you and what goes into making great products is is great people
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.460]  It is great culture, but it's also
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:07.660]  You have there's a there's a hunger. There's a need there's a market opportunity and you know
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:13.420]  You have there's a there's a need there's a market opportunity and you're forming your company around that opportunity
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:19.740]  I mean as the fact of the matter is that Apple has a product that makes up 70 to 80% of its profits
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:22.620]  it's the most profitable product in the history of ever and
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:29.660]  You it's just impossible to form the company-wide incentives that are necessary to drive
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:35.340]  A startup or to drive a Tesla to drive any number of these other companies
[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:39.020]  Whether it's being a bad company or the executives being bad executives or people being bad people
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:44.380]  It's a it's just it's like a it's like a fact of life. It's like a law. I mean
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:46.780]  you cannot
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:51.900]  Have the incentive structure of a startup when you're a 750 billion dollar company
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:57.980]  You just can't right and and there's people that want that that thrive on that and it's natural that they pursue that
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.100]  I still think that in hindsight even
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:06.460]  In for nobody really foresaw that the iPhone was the culmination of personal computing
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:11.260]  But in hindsight, it's obvious that it was that this is where everything is going
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:15.820]  It's making the same thing all along right from day one Apple's been making the personal computer from day one
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:22.540]  Right and and the iPhone fits perfectly in the evolution of Apple as a whole right and the one thing that Apple missed
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:29.100]  Steve Jobs missed everybody I think missed up until and and
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:33.020]  I'm not a huge Netscape fan. I'm not a huge Mark Anderson fan
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.620]  Andresen how do you say his name? I don't know and recent
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:42.540]  I think but I do think that he and Netscape saw something that was missed in the entire PC
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.540]  And I think Bill Gates missed everybody missed
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.740]  Was that
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.420]  ultimately
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:51.420]  personal computing
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:57.340]  Was destined to fundamentally be a communicate a personal communication tech technology
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:02.060]  that it's about people communicating with each other and where where Apple really
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.220]  missed out up until
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.900]  The last decade that you know a decade ago
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:13.980]  You know when the comeback in the 2000s with you know post post iPod and when when the Mac
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:19.740]  Finally started like picking up share and then ultimately with the iPhone was was that
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:26.220]  Most people have no need or care for a personal computing device forget the word
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:32.300]  PC whether you mean like Windows or Mac or you know the iPhone or whatever just a personal computing device in plain language
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:37.340]  until they until the internet and the only reason they wanted the internet was to communicate with other people and
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:43.340]  Read and write and so everything pre-internet that Apple did was falling on deaf ears
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:50.140]  I mean, it's it's fundamentally why then you know in my opinion is fundamentally why the the the Newton failed
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.540]  because the form factor was entirely about
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:55.740]  Being more personal than a Mac that it was smaller
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.980]  It wasn't pocket size
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.820]  But they could have made one pocket size if it had taken off surely if it had you know
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:07.420]  If it had gotten any kind of traction in the market surely they would have made a Palm Pilot size one
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:16.620]  But it was pre-internet and it didn't have you know, there wasn't a therefore wasn't a communication device and therefore it gained no traction
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:23.180]  And that's what the iPhone fundamentally is. I mean for you know, other than games if you took away all the apps that people use
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:26.620]  To communicate with each other they wouldn't use their phones at all
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:34.140]  Yep. No, this is exactly this is exactly right. I wrote this piece last spring called everything as a service that
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.940]  basically the point of it is that the iPhone was the
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.540]  ultimate the culmination the best ever sort of
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:49.420]  Manufactured device broadly and PC specifically and the reason is because it was empowered by the future
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:52.220]  right what makes the iPhone like the
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.100]  we talked about mobile and you know,
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:59.180]  People would make fun of Sasha Nadella saying Microsoft's gonna be called first mobile first
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:04.620]  But the reality is those are the same thing, right? The the phone is nothing without the cloud
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:09.580]  It's like Facebook is nothing without the the servers in the cloud. Google's nothing serves in the cloud
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:16.060]  Snapchat Twitter, whatever you want to be. It's all depends on there. It's it's it's a yin and yang sort of thing and
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.060]  and
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:25.340]  The iPhone was better than any other PC that came before it any other device that came before it because it was
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:32.140]  Lit up it was enabled by the future but the future means that the iPhone is the end, right?
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:36.460]  It's the end of the line in some respects because the future will be fully in the future
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:40.780]  I totally I I I think that's true right like the watch is not the new phone
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:44.060]  I think the watch is undersold as a success. I think Apple is
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:49.420]  You know, I I I wouldn't be surprised if if 2017 they become the number one
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:54.940]  By revenue watch company in the world. I mean, I think they were what number two last year to Rolex
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.940]  I mean, yeah, I mean the top five
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:01.820]  That's nothing to sneeze at it's a fine business, but it's not the new iPhone, right?
[01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:07.260]  It's right. It is clearly something different and as the watch has evolved. It's become less like the iPhone, right?
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:13.180]  Like the 1.0 watch was more like an iPhone where they were talking about this grid of apps that you would launch and
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:20.460]  The watch os3, you know second generation hardware third generation os is a lot more like hey
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.780]  It's a fitness tracker and notification display
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:27.900]  Yep, it's an accessory which is better because it's more clearly what is
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:32.380]  What what the wrist is good for but it's not that it's not a replacement for the phone
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.820]  Yep. Yeah, I know I agree
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:41.340]  I mean, I think the the future when and if we get there is probably some sort of thing where you know
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:47.660]  Yeah, it's a very long run where we're carrying some sort maybe it's the watch but some sort of identification device where basically any screen around
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.060]  us can become our personal computer and
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:55.420]  You know, we don't but I mean the reality is the phone is it's not a replacement for the phone
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:01.420]  But I mean the reality is the phone is is clearly a sort of endpoint I think and and that's fine
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.100]  That's good for Apple because Apple sells
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:05.260]  the most profitable phone by far and they will
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:11.100]  Make a lot of money off it for a very long time and as a company as an ongoing enterprise that that's great
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:16.780]  But I do think it really raises really really fundamental questions about you know
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.900]  if you want to look at 20 30 years out, what what is Apple's future because
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:27.260]  Going all the way back to to to the late 70s. I mean Apple's been a personal computer company and
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.780]  and the iPhone in like it was
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:36.460]  It was the future was the internet broadly that let the Mac sort of come back and be a viable
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:43.100]  Platform for you know, everyone makes people beyond the die-hards like you to work like everyone else
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:49.020]  but it was the cloud generally and what that enabled that made the iPhone the juggernaut that it is but
[01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:54.140]  That that's also the future that's gonna eventually obsolete obsolete the PC and that's okay
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:58.300]  like again, that's that's the way things go and you know better to have
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:05.660]  You know better to have shown brightly than to have not shown at all as it were and nothing's shown brighter than the iPhone
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:09.180]  I'm not counting them out, but I don't you know
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:15.260]  I don't know that it's any more likely than not that the next big thing would come from Apple. I don't know, you know
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:20.620]  But yeah, no, I don't come that all either but I can but I can understand why I I can understand why
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.180]  some of these really
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:27.980]  You know noteworthy employees who've been with Apple for a long time why they suddenly want to go somewhere else like
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:34.140]  You know for one maybe they just want to change but for two, I mean if you think about the future, I mean
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:41.100]  Not only are we moving out of Apple's sweet spot, which is personal computing
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:48.860]  Sweet spot, which is personal computing not only it but but also the you know, just the company
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:55.580]  It's so consumed by the iPhone appropriately. So that's like Apple's in execution mode
[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:58.780]  It's not an innovation mode and that's the mode. It should be in right
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:06.700]  it's you know, they're the at the point where they're going from a 99 good product to a 99.9 good product to a
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:12.400]  99.99 percent good product to keep adding nines as the product keeps getting better
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.480]  And you know, I I would argue that in some ways the mac is you know
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.680]  that's one of the reasons mac hardware has slowed to such a degree where
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:27.600]  There might be future directions for desktop computing that are big new areas or you know
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:30.560]  big new ideas or whatever, but the basic idea of
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:38.000]  you've got these windows you drag around on a screen and menus and apps that run and a mouse pointer that you either use a
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.920]  Mouse or a trackpad and a keyboard and and you sit there and do it. It's it's at a you know
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:45.800]  It's an old is what it is
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:51.560]  It's an old paradigm and it's is what it is and it's really getting polished out to you know
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.280]  A very large 99 point. It's not a new thing
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.960]  Yeah, like we said we would rather Apple slow down on the OS 10 updates, right? It's fine
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:04.440]  just let it be right whereas a lot of the most talented people at Apple from the last 10 years are the people who
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:10.960]  Stood up the iPhone from the world where a quote-unquote smartphone was a ridiculous, you know, blackberry or
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:19.320]  Symbian thing from Nokia running like not really a real OS but like some kind of embedded OS and
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.960]  As like an up-down left-right metaphor that they stood up this entire
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:30.800]  Paradigm of touch-based computing in a rich, you know, gooey environment with you know
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.560]  no perceptible latency when you scroll and
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:42.720]  You know all of these things that we just take for granted as as the oxygen of the device, you know in our pocket
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.760]  They stood it up from nothing to a thing
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:53.960]  And that's what they're good at is is you know going taking an idea that doesn't even exist and getting it to the
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.200]  98% you know 98% good
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.760]  That's what they live for and the other thing too is like that that's there that's always been their business model
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.840]  Like their business model has been to deliver the best possible experience and charge a premium for it, right?
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:17.360]  Yeah, and and that's the other thing you get to these other categories like services is not about charging a premium for a differentiated product
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.360]  right car is
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:24.600]  Right today it is but you know, that's our that's our Mercedes or BMW makes money
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.760]  but in the future if you get to a transportation as a service like these sort of uber style networks or
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:36.480]  car sharing or whatever it might be like the business it's not clear that they have a business model going forward and
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.400]  Licensing or building like fleets or whatever. That's not an Apple business model
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.360]  And again, it doesn't mean the company's not gonna be a viable concern going forward. It's just that everything like everything about the iPhone
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.720]  If you back up far enough
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:52.360]  It was no different than everything about the original Mac like that
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:58.840]  the business model was the same the approach was the same the needs it was seeking to serve was the same and
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:02.400]  That's because the personal computer is is you know
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.400]  Steve Jobs is from David see I saw this for anyone talking about the power of the personal computer and I will transform
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.960]  people and I've said before like my all-time one of my all-time favorite Steve Jobs moments was his second to last keynote the iPad to
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.400]  Introduction and it was right after they demoed iMovie and they had demoed GarageBand
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.640]  It was after the GarageBand demo Steve Jobs always a lover of music and stuff and he came out in this
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.820]  look of like contentment on his face and he's like
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.580]  Now anyone can make music and you like you could see it
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:37.700]  like I actually typed on Twitter at the time like I think this might be his last keynote because like it was like it was
[01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:40.900]  like his salutation like my wife's work is completed here and
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:47.080]  and that's an amazing thing and and the and that's fantastic, but like
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.380]  The world if the world goes on it does
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.480]  Did you watch I?
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:59.840]  I don't think Dalrymple and I talked about it on my last show but the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.240]  introduction was a
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:08.400]  Couple weeks ago. Did you I rewatch did you rewatch the the I I looked at parts of it
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:14.560]  I mean, yeah, it's it's a world. It's a world-changing event. It really is. I remember I was there
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.720]  It was early and I'm so glad I was but it was early in the era when I was regularly
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.120]  Attending Apple keynotes like even just a year or two before it was sort of it
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:29.800]  I think I'd been to like a WWDC note or two before that but like Macworld keynotes
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.560]  I wasn't going to because I just you know that I
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.700]  Was just a guy who never left his house
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.320]  But I was at the stuff to until 11 in the morning Macworld 2007 keynote
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:45.320]  I had a press pass for it was one of the first that I got a press pass for so I had a
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.520]  Good seat close to the front and I just remember thinking at the time
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:55.880]  That this is this is it. This is the keynote that we've every single other keynote has ever has been
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.240]  You know because we wanted this one. This is the one and it's somehow it you know, illogically
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:05.880]  It's the one that that we collectively want Apple to give every single time
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.000]  Right, we've changed the world again, you know
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.640]  But that they literally did but the thing that struck me was when I was looking for like YouTube clips of it
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.200]  Is that a whole bunch of them?
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:23.160]  cut out like the first five or six minutes of the keynote and just start with when he starts talking about the iPhone and
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:28.280]  To me, they're missing what was so amazing about that keynote
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:35.000]  Which was that the first five or six minutes were about like the Mac and something else
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.840]  No is more than that. I wrote all this the first 30 minutes were about the Apple TV
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.160]  It was I would do it. No that was I thought that came at the end after the iPhone
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:49.880]  No, they open with the with the Apple TV and like and that's it's kind of remarkable when you think about it, right?
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.600]  I mean clearly the jobs knew they had something right?
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:57.720]  I mean, you don't build up like we like we did the the my the Mac and the iPod now
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720]  We're doing a new thing and did it
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:05.880]  but at the same time like you don't put in 20 to 30 minutes about the Apple TV if you're introducing one of the most
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440]  If you're making one of the biggest and most
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:12.440]  Meaningful product announcements of all time and again like it's not just the iPhone
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:20.600]  It's like the entire world today and the upheaval that's in it is all tied back to that product and the the what it did
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.280]  in I mean
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.440]  It's it's remarkable in retrospect
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:29.160]  Well, the line that I remember was when he gave like a brief update about the Mac at the very beginning
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.560]  But then he said but we're not here to talk about the Mac today
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:35.880]  And it was like the like the iPhone
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:41.160]  and it was like the like the oxygen just came out of the crowd because it was
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:45.240]  The the the context to remember is that leading up to that keynote?
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.680]  It was widely rumored that Apple was going to introduce a phone
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:54.520]  And you know somehow the just the simple fact that Apple was going to introduce an iPhone
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:02.120]  Something called an iPhone was leaked and you know, I don't know if that came just because of their negotiations with singular
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.200]  I don't know, you know
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:12.040]  But somehow just that pure information leaked but what it was going to be like didn't leak at all. There was absolutely no
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:20.360]  Word no rumors. No guesses. Nobody knew whether it was going to be an iPod that can make phone calls or something else
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.840]  And I remember that it somebody reported it like
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:33.560]  On Saturday, like I don't know like the journal or the New York Times just that it's widely rumored that they're going to introduce a phone
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.680]  And I remember I got to San Francisco on Sunday
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:43.000]  You know an early flight and it was like the afternoon and I was walking down Market Street in San Francisco
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.560]  and I ran into James Duncan Davidson and
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.840]  Daniel Steinberg who's like a tech tech book author
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.520]  they were having coffee somewhere and they knew me and I came over and joined them and
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.400]  And they were like, what do you think? What do you think's going on tomorrow?
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.240]  and I was like, you know what the weird part is is that usually if something like this is
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.760]  Widely rumored and it's not true
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.440]  Apple somehow gets word out to sort of set expectations accordingly
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:12.520]  like if if every you know, if somebody reports that Apple is going to
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:19.580]  Announce cold fusion on Monday and it's not true. They don't they haven't invented cold fusion
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:25.460]  They'll somebody else will come out with it, you know, somebody else will get the story that no
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:30.980]  They're not going to have cold fusion and it may not get everybody to calm down, but it'll calm things down. But like
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:35.380]  Saturday somebody said they're gonna have they're gonna introduce a phone and Sunday
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:39.660]  It was just pure silence and I was like, I really think they're gonna do it
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:42.420]  And so and then I think everybody else is sort of thinking the same thing
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:46.100]  so everybody kind of went in to the keynote like with their breath held and like
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:50.800]  two minutes in Steve Jobs says we're not going to talk about the Mac today and it was like whoa, I
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:59.960]  The excitement in that room was so palpable. It's it's just impossible to to know it would have been amazing to be there
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:06.680]  I mean that yeah, and and I mean that it's the greatest keynote ever. I mean, there's it was in the tech industry
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:13.480]  It's it's remarkable and and you know, the in the whole thing like it's it's a widescreen iPod. It's a phone
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.400]  it's an internet communicator and everyone cheers loudly on the first two and you know kind of
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.320]  mumbles on the third and
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:24.240]  Again, I mean like because this is the flip side, right?
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:30.800]  I write a lot of major theme on trajectory is beyond the bismal stuff, but it's about like the internet and its impact on
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.600]  Not just business but society generally right but but again, it's it's yin and yang like the internet
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.640]  It's the internet plus mobile
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.840]  It's those two things go together because it's not just sitting down at your desk and having access the internet
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.720]  It's it you having full access to everything
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:51.720]  anywhere all the time in at every place in every location and in
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:57.000]  These two things are hand in hand. You can't divorce their impact from the other and
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:04.160]  That the iPhone changed the world it like Steve Jobs didn't more than put a dent in the world. He fundamentally changed the
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:11.120]  The course of like it changed the course of history. It really did I I can I it not to be hyperbolic
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:18.700]  But I believe you can trace what's happening these few years and the upheaval in society to that keynote. Yep
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:22.800]  It's remarkable I
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:29.640]  If it wasn't I mean, you know, let's let's you know, let's delve into it a little bit
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:35.760]  But if it wasn't for the iPhone, there wouldn't be Android as we know it Android might have still existed
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:40.960]  It was an existing project before the iPhone was introduced, but it was like a Blackberry clone type thing
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.000]  Yeah, and if that's what Android had been
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:49.280]  I don't think Donald Trump would have used it and I don't think Donald Trump would be a presence on Twitter
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:55.840]  And if Donald Trump wasn't a presence on Twitter and ever present presence on Twitter, I don't think he would have become president
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.240]  No, well, it's not just that though. It's it's the I
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.100]  Think you can draw tribalism. I completely agree. Like I don't think it's like a trick pull shot
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.400]  I don't think it's like, you know
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:09.180]  the cue ball hits the nine and the nine hits the
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.400]  Sidebar and then it hits the seven and the seven hits the two and the two goes in the corner pocket
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:17.880]  I think it's a straight shot between the iPhone and Trump as president
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:25.160]  it is and and I mean it was the iPhone and the internet combined that really broke down the
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:29.880]  hold that the the mainstream media had on information dispersal and
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:36.560]  That broke down the limits of geography when people came to kind of banding together right now you could on Facebook
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:42.920]  Find all kinds of people that agreed with you that weren't necessarily next to you in your hometown and you could build
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:49.160]  Basically, it removed geography as a limitation on all sorts of things and it made media less powerful and you could get your news from
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.760]  anywhere you go around it do whatever you wanted and it broke down all these things that held society together as it was and
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.240]  No
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:04.200]  I 100% without question agree let that you can draw a straight line from the iPhone introduction to yeah
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:06.200]  Donald Trump being president
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.240]  So so clearly what we need to do is invent a time machine to go back in time and
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.240]  and prevent
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.560]  Stop the eye
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400]  The iPhone is the new Hitler
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:28.400]  There's a title for your podcast what else do we have to talk about this week? Oh you want to talk about
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:31.760]  Payspot oh
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.520]  Yeah, it's a tradition. So we always talk about our drinks. I'm having a couple beers tonight. I
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.280]  Still do have a sparkling water as well
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:43.320]  Um, oh you betcha that the sparkling water is explode, right?
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:46.760]  So I realize I do have one of the original it's the original soda stream
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.160]  Which I have and there's no pressure release
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:53.760]  You have to manually pressure release it like when you pump it and you kind of pull the bottle out and release the pressure
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.440]  Well, I whereas I got a new one. So I went from my office and one for my one for my house
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.340]  I got a new one for the house and that one releases pressure automatically
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:08.960]  So I'm pretty sure that the ones that exploded were using the original one and didn't know you had to release pressure every single time
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:10.960]  You know, that's my soda stream update
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:15.520]  This is my philosophy my philosophy on on being a successful
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  internet internet writer is
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.720]  You need a fussy way to make coffee. You need
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.020]  Endless supply of fizzy water and you need a clicky keyboard
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:32.440]  And so I for years agree on the copy word well, you can disagree I would I would I
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:39.840]  I would list the I would actually put the fizzy water first and the fussy way to make coffee second and the clicky keyboard third
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.280]  because I I would rather I'd probably rather have
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:47.760]  shittier coffee, but still have fizzy water than to have
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.760]  Great coffee and have to drink flat water flat water. I every time I take a sip of flat water
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.880]  I feel like I'm sick like I'm getting a cold
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.760]  And you're gonna get more Twitter responses because we get it every time you complain about busy water
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  Well, they're part
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:07.440]  One of the funny parts about that is my wife hates fizzy water absolutely hates
[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:13.360]  so like when we go out to dinner if we get water a lot of times we'll get two bottles of water and one flat
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.360]  one still and
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.400]  Sometimes like if she accidentally like takes the wrong glass or something like that
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.520]  She'll like it, you know
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.880]  I as bad as it is if you're expecting fizzy water and you take a sip of still it's even it's it's like dangerous
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:30.120]  If you think you're gonna take a big gulp of still water and you get a highly carbonated
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.880]  Right because you have the natural tendency to spit it out. Plus it's like moving around in your mouth
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:39.080]  So it kind of accentuates it right and so for those who are not longtime listeners
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.080]  I've years ago found out about a company called SodaStream that lets you make your own fizzy water at home
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.520]  which is a true game changer so that you're not buying, you know bottles of Pellegrino or
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.520]  Whatever area yeah, which is expensive and it's a pain in the ass and you end up with all these glass
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.560]  But you can just I could just make endless supplies of my own fizzy water
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:02.640]  But I have the model that they I don't know if that's what they call it the penguin, but it looks like a penguin
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:07.040]  And I I think I can't get my bottle out without doing a pressure release
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:13.920]  But anyway, the originals there is the genesis is different. So but yeah, but every time I'm on your podcast we talk about
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:16.200]  blogger drinks
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.200]  You know, I my favorite
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:23.560]  Saying is I think from you and Merlin you can tell what you tell what time of day it is by what you're drinking. Yes
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:29.160]  So usually I'm on whiskey now, but I'm just trying to take it
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:32.240]  I feel like I got a little tipsy last time I was on the podcast with you. So I'm trying to take it easy
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:34.240]  It was a holiday
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:37.320]  But the other thing is I feel like I've talked about
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:41.040]  Utilities on the Mac which was easy to make before we move on to that
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:44.840]  I do have to say that the other thing is that like right before Christmas I did send you a link
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.840]  I don't know if I can find it but I sent you a link
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.800]  To somebody who is also a writer who's who's SodaStream blew up in his face
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.800]  I mean, I don't mean to do that
[01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:58.440]  But literally it broke the glass. He had like shards of glass
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.280]  I mean, he was alright didn't go in his eye
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:05.060]  But it I mean he really looked like he had been like in a terrible car accident or something like his face
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.560]  This is all messed up and it scared the shit out of you
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:15.500]  It did it did. Yeah, it because it turned out it is this specific model. They don't sell it anymore, right?
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:19.880]  But I'm still I'm still powering through because I think I know how to release pressure. So I think it's okay
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:23.920]  And then the other thing you like to talk about our clipboard utilities
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:27.560]  Yes, so I've talked about it almost every time and I have a new update
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.640]  I think I use something called copy and paste which actually did have search
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:33.880]  I said it didn't last time but I have switched to paste spot
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.600]  by by
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:44.240]  Yeah, the tap outs guys make tweet bot and it's it's fantastic and I felt bad because he released it
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:48.140]  I think at 20 bucks and then quickly lower the price. I think people thought was too high or whatever. I paid 20 bucks
[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:55.760]  I didn't ask for a refund because it's it's fantastic work and it's it's it's I mean you can not only do you have the
[01:59:56.180 --> 02:00:03.260]  The pace generally clipboard history, but it has the it's conversion functions where you can convert from like
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:09.080]  HTML to plain text or to markdown or whatever might be like it totally built-in is amazing
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:11.680]  You can search just by typing you have to click a search field
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.920]  Which I had to my old one to find an old clip you can store clips
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:21.920]  So I use it for support customer support for secretary where I just store like emails that I send
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:27.360]  Regularly, you know, I just use that instead of I was using text expander. I don't really use text expand
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.440]  I was only using it for tech support basically anyway, and this is much better and nicer
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:35.680]  Anyhow, I just want to say I've switched to pay spot. It's fantastic. And and
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:41.600]  Since I talk about it every time I felt I felt the need to update I have it installed. I like it
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.380]  It is my new I I was previously using launch bars built-in clipboard manager, and I still use launch bar
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.720]  But I've switched to
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:54.240]  Payspot and
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.240]  I like it better. I
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.920]  Still think launch bars is my second favorite, but I like it one of the little things they do
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:03.260]  That's nice is you bring it up with a little keyboard shortcut
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.980]  And then like to start searching
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.960]  To not get like one of your like you can just use the up and down arrows to get like, you know
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.320]  Whichever one you want and then you hit enter and it just paste whichever one you want
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.160]  but if you have one like you said that that's older I
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:23.220]  Love the way that to search you just start typing to search, right? There's no extra quicker
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:27.340]  you don't have to click in the field don't have to hit tab to switch you just start typing and it's
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:31.320]  It it just switches to search and I find that to be incredibly useful
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.480]  Right because I by far the biggest thing in my list is is URLs
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:40.880]  I just have tons and tons and tons of them and generally speaking if a site has relatively sane URLs
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:45.200]  You can just start typing the general word and it finds it every time it's it's fantastic
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.640]  right, or you know, like it'll match like a substring of it like
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.420]  You can type
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:56.880]  Wiki and it'll just show filter it down to the ones with Wikipedia links or something like that
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.120]  Right, exactly
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:05.480]  Or verge or whatever and it'll just filter down to that and you don't have to match from like the beginning of the string
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.840]  Or something like that when you yeah, because it will do anywhere the URL
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.880]  So if the URL has the name of the article in the URL like most sites do
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.040]  Like I'm looking at one here like the ringer comm slash widgets dash auto dash Porter
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:19.960]  I remember I ran an article out of Porter
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:26.040]  I start typing auto Porter and it pops up right away because it's it's it finds it in the middle of the string
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.480]  I feel like I haven't entirely internalized
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:36.480]  What what pay spot can do like I understand it, but I haven't like automated it like because there's another feature
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.320]  It has I forget what they call it, but you can like copy three things and and put it in
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:44.320]  There's a you can use a keyboard shortcut to put it into a certain mode
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:48.560]  Where I use I've just started using that. Yeah, you need this a new thing
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.960]  You have to teach yourself how to use it, right?
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:50.240]  but yeah
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:56.400]  You enter a certain mode and you copy like 15 things in a row and then you you can paste them back in order
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.920]  Right. Well, I actually do use that because I have like corporate accounts and I'll get like 20 names in the spreadsheet, right?
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.920]  I want you to put them into my in my in my software to track them
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.680]  So I'll just go through the spreadsheet and do name email address name
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:12.480]  You know all the way down the list and I switch to my other software and just do like just I can just put them
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:17.040]  Right in it's it's a great great app. And if you don't have some sort of
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:23.960]  Clipboard manager for your Mac. It is it really you're missing out. Yeah. Why are you using a Mac? Right?
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.440]  It's exactly and it's the exact sort of thing
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.060]  That again, I'm not I'm not disputing that there are people who are like, you know
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:39.620]  Totally power users who just use iPads, you know exclusively and have moved away from the Mac
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:42.140]  But it's the sort of thing that would keep me from ever
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:44.360]  Being able to do that
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:52.020]  Like I I feel I always feel slightly crippled on iOS where I'm on an iPhone or iPad that I've only got one
[02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:55.340]  Just the most recent thing I've copied is the only thing I can paste
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:02.280]  Whereas on the back I can paste I I always feel like I can paste anything that I've done in the last few hours
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.980]  I can I can still paste again. Oh totally and you
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:11.200]  Filters into the entire work for everywhere like you just start copying stuff because you know, you're gonna want it eventually
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:17.040]  That's true. I do that. Yeah, you just and you know, it's there right? It's kind of like you it's like your scratch pad
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.480]  That is just always present. Yeah, I am I clipboard manager is like by far
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:30.560]  My number one most essential utility and why I could never not not use a PC. All right, let me ask you this. I
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.440]  Have not used pay spots ability to store it frequently use snippets
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.340]  When you do that, do you have to switch a mode or can when you search do they do they all search?
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.640]  Yeah, so you can label them so they have regular things
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.800]  So like if someone like I'd mentioned the corporate things, right? So someone inquires about a corporate thing
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.240]  I just type corporate and and it merely goes to my safe snippet
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:05:00.480]  That's an entire email that explains like the program that I have and et cetera, et cetera. I just see that right now
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:05.200]  I see it. I see it with their little they have like they come they ship with one called creative quotes
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:10.420]  And I started searching for crazy one crazy and it just says here's to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:15.880]  So it just shows up. Wow, that is incredible. I'm gonna start if you use the text conversion, too
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:22.480]  I don't I don't I but I don't know what I would need to use it for. Oh, so I use it a lot. Um, like
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.480]  I
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.720]  Was so when I do when I edit the exponent podcasts
[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:34.140]  I always take the do the show notes in the text pane in logic. This is actually where I end up using the most
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.640]  And just because it's there and I'm already in the in the app
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:43.360]  But if you ever paste a link in it doesn't it just paste with style. Yeah, I want to paste plain text
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:43.760]  Yeah
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.080]  so if you go and paste spot and there's a little filter thing and you click it and
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:55.180]  You can convert to plain text convert to smart. You can do the convert to smart uppercase lowercase title case
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:57.180]  Like it's this super powerful
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:01.980]  Text conversion engine that is super easy to use like my old one had it
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:04.780]  But you had to click into a specific mode and click a thing
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:07.580]  Whereas this is just it's very straightforward and what to do
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:14.380]  So you could basically do conversion operations on text that's on the clipboard as you're pasting it. Yeah
[02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:20.260]  I don't know why I never need that. I guess I always I just I don't know you just live in plain text
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:23.740]  Oh, yeah, I just live in plain text. So it's never a problem for me, but I can see why it would be
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:26.820]  Yeah, if you're pasting the plain text editor is no problem
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:30.900]  It's only if you ever pasting into a right a stylized editor that it comes up
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.920]  Anything else you want to talk about this week?
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:36.660]  Feel like that's a good show
[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:42.700]  Yeah, I think it's pretty solid. So we didn't really talk about the App Store, which I fine. It's not that big a deal though
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:45.540]  I mean, I'm still waiting on trials and trials and upgrades
[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.500]  Yeah, the App Store changes
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.180]  Cumbered in like a minute
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:56.060]  I mean more or less they've added that they announced this week with the upcoming or it now shipping betas
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:59.780]  and the upcoming next really point releases of iOS and
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.860]  Mac OS
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:09.220]  They are adding the ability for developers to respond to reviews in the App Store. So in other words if a user
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.900]  writes a review that says
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:18.140]  I bought this app to do blah blah blah and when I do it it crashes and the developer knows
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:21.020]  Oh, I know exactly what that bug is. I have a workaround
[02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:23.340]  in
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.340]  For the last ten years or nine years
[02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:33.060]  The developer has been completely hamstrung because they have no way to respond no way to contact that user no way to post a response
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.100]  even though they know exactly what it is that the user is is
[02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:42.180]  Complaining about or maybe the user says I bought this app because I wanted to do
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:46.740]  X Y and Z and the app only does X and Y but it does do X Y and Z
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:50.380]  But they just don't know how to do Z and the developer knows exactly how to tell them how to do Z
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:55.680]  Now the developer can chime in and and put a response in the App Store. So that's
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.540]  This is what happens after nine years of the App Store's
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.860]  Innovative features like this
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:05.720]  And then the other change is on iOS in particular
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:08.840]  They are adding new API's
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:15.460]  official API's for developers to prompt the user to leave a review in the App Store and
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.040]  It's got a limit of three
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:22.200]  It's only right that we talk about this because this has been sort of a hobby horse of mine for a while
[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:29.460]  Three times per year or per 365 days, so it's not really like calendar based
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:36.460]  That's that's the limit of how many times any particular app will be able to prompt you and if you've already left a review
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:41.580]  Within the last 365 days. It won't be able to prompt you at all, which is super welcome
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:46.220]  the one app in particular that gets me on a weekly basis is
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:52.980]  Fucking OpenTable because I use it because it's uh, I don't I mean, I don't want to keep you here
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:56.820]  We've been on the show for two hours, but I don't know how the hell OpenTable cornered this market
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:01.580]  But they've cornered the entire market on making online reservations
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:07.340]  And I use it because I hate making phone calls. I don't even like to call a restaurant to make a review
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:14.060]  I just I love using OpenTable, but the goddamn app every fucking week
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:19.020]  it asked me to leave a review and I actually do what I always threatened to do with OpenTable is
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:24.020]  every time they prompt me I go and I go to the App Store and I leave a review and
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:30.180]  I complain that it's always badgering me for reviews. So here's a review one star and I'd give it one star
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:35.780]  Arrogation theory John irrigation theory, that's all fun table wins. No, the the I
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:41.380]  Hoping that the ability respond reviews comes to podcasts because there's this one review
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:46.580]  There's this one review in the well you hope for today, especially but there's this one review of
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:51.860]  Exponent that says they talk about topics that are too complex. It'd be better if they had a blog and
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:53.700]  it
[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:55.700]  enrages me
[02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:04.100]  That is amazing, I wish I wish I could tell you that I wrote that review I
[02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:10.340]  Get I get more people who email like if they clearly didn't read the blog post
[02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:13.500]  They just respond to the podcast and it's mildly irritating
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:18.780]  But that one in the iTunes store is just like it it's been there for like a year and it just drives me up the fucking
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:20.780]  ball
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:22.060]  I
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:26.500]  Do think it at some sense. There's a way that you can complain say wow after nine years
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:33.580]  They're finally adding these things, but I do think that in some sense. It's you know, it's only been a year since Schiller took over
[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:41.600]  The app stores and it's they that they've sort of had an official like hey the buck stops here leader
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:46.140]  So, you know, yeah, it's like it's the second. That's the second meaningful change
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:49.340]  I mean because they did this description pricing, um in the summer
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:56.440]  So yeah, I still think I mean again, I will bang the trials and upgrade up upgrade drum until they come
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:00.100]  But you know, I and you know, I
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:03.020]  Clearly there's an infrastructure issue here
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:05.100]  hopefully
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:07.520]  This means they're actually making changes
[02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:15.060]  and those changes would by definition take time and building software is hard and building software that has to handle
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:22.460]  The App Store is really hard. So yeah, I mean, it's good. It's a good signal. It's a good signal. I think is the
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:25.340]  biggest positive
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:31.860]  Yeah, so that they actually are listening and they're doing something that developers have actually asked for for a long time
[02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:32.660]  Yeah
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:39.740]  And I hope they change the the resetting ratings thing because right now if you're a developer you're incentivized to not update your app
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:45.660]  If you have good ratings, yes, because to update your your app resets the ratings and that's the exact wrong incentive
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:50.940]  Apple should want they should want developers fixing bugs updating their apps. And so that's something that I hope they
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.580]  They take care of yeah
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:12:01.300]  It's two incentive problems where one it's if you already have a version that has a bunch of great reviews and ratings
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:04.300]  you're incentivized not to update it even with a minor bug fix and
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.620]  And second if you do issue regular minor updates
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:14.700]  Which in theory is a good thing because you're fixing bugs on a regular basis or making small improvements on a regular basis
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:20.100]  You're incentivized to keep asking people for reviews because every time you update one you have to write exactly
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:22.980]  Yeah, so I asked them about it. I
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:28.460]  Spoke to someone at Apple about it and they you know did not have a good answer
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.100]  they did not have an official answer to that, but they
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:37.900]  Completely acknowledged that they are well aware of of the entire, you know, the fact that it's is not right
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:39.900]  so I'm optimistic that
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:45.240]  Sometime, you know, maybe like by WWDC. Maybe they'll have an answer to that
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:49.540]  You know that some just give the developer the option ask them if they want to reset the ratings or not
[02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:54.620]  That hey, if they invested to do a new app, they got a new developer
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.400]  Let them reset it and if they have a great rating let them keep it
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:01.980]  That's pretty that's a pretty good answer because then what's the worst case scenario there at a shitty app?
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:05.860]  That keeps getting bad reviews and the developer keeps resetting it
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:11.080]  Well, that's the same situation that they you know, it's that's no worse than the current situation exactly
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:15.020]  Yeah, whereas a good developer with a quality app that has quality
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:17.780]  reviews
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:23.740]  Yeah, I that I think you just solved the problem that's actually pretty smart. I wish I had thought of that
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:27.820]  Well, that's what happens at 2 30 in the morning. I'm gonna steal that and put that on on Daring Fireball
[02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:31.100]  Go ahead. All right, Ben Thompson. I
