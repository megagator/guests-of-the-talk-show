[00:00.000 --> 00:03.520]  I have a good story. It's why I'm late.
[00:05.840 --> 00:07.360]  Just two hours and fifteen minutes.
[00:07.360 --> 00:11.600]  Just two hours and fifteen minutes. Well, number one, you were gracious enough. I told you,
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.000]  we scheduled this this afternoon, and I had a furniture delivery scheduled for a one-to-five
[00:18.000 --> 00:25.360]  window. And I said, and you said, I'm kind of flexible. And I said, thank God. And I said,
[00:25.360 --> 00:33.120]  I'll bet you, I'll bet you they show up at 4 59. Pretty close, right? I think they showed up at 4
[00:33.120 --> 00:40.240]  44. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 20 minutes before the windows, window closed. Yeah. Which, you know,
[00:40.240 --> 00:46.320]  okay, they made it. Well, but here's the thing. It's nerve wracking, because we're having
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.760]  renovations done on the downstairs, like my office is downstairs. And we've been here for a couple
[00:51.760 --> 00:56.400]  years and I've never, we've never really done my office. Like, that was like to be done later.
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.560]  And we had the stairs painted. We, I mean, just painted. I mean, like, so just painted that the
[01:04.560 --> 01:14.640]  painters are still painting my office, but they've already done the stairs. And we have the, I love
[01:14.640 --> 01:21.920]  this guy. His name is Oleg. He's was born in Poland and he is the greatest painter house
[01:21.920 --> 01:29.280]  painter you would ever want because he's, he's obviously got like, Ted Williams, 2040 vision,
[01:29.280 --> 01:38.160]  right? Like, you know, this guy can spot like a flaw on a wall or a ceiling all the way across
[01:38.160 --> 01:45.600]  the room. And he'll be like, oh, that was, you know, a patch. The guy is an absolute perfectionist,
[01:45.600 --> 01:51.840]  but he works fast, right? Like, it's like the ideal combination, right? And he shows up every
[01:51.840 --> 01:58.240]  day on time and he's, and he's just, just a delightful, delightful man. And he does meticulous
[01:58.240 --> 02:03.520]  work, but works fast, right? Like, yeah, I'm a perfectionist. I love being a perfectionist. You
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.120]  know what I don't do? I don't work fast. Yeah, right. You usually do not see that both of those
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.320]  in the same person. Yeah, right. We had great guys. We had our basement redone again. And
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.880]  these guys are Russians and they were fantastic. They weren't, they're not perfectionists,
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.520]  but they were certainly good enough for the basement. And they were quite fast. So that
[02:25.520 --> 02:32.560]  was good. Well, Oleg was still here and was here to watch the guys delivering this big piece of
[02:32.560 --> 02:40.720]  furniture up the stairs and let them know that he just painted the walls and gave them his Polish
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.760]  stink eye as they brought it up the stairs. And they have to say they did a great job.
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.160]  But anyway, that's number one, why I'm late, because I had to wait for this furniture delivery
[02:50.160 --> 02:56.480]  and I had, you know, told Amy that I would take care of it and I did. And then I thought, well,
[02:56.480 --> 03:01.600]  why don't I go get coffee? There's, you know, my local coffee place is about five minutes away.
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.400]  I told you it would be five minutes because Amy wanted a coffee too. And she likes like a caramel
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.560]  macchiato thing that you can't make at home. And I thought, wouldn't that be a nice treat for her,
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.320]  you know, because I'm going to disappear here for two hours, do a podcast. I'll go out and it's
[03:16.320 --> 03:23.040]  very cold today. It is negative 43 degrees here in Philadelphia. 36 degrees. But I think the
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.320]  feels-like is negative 40. I don't have the feels-like on, but that's what it feels like.
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.120]  But I thought this wouldn't that be a nice thing to do? You know, it's, you know, it's what you
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.520]  do for your wife. You know, you do those things. Yeah. I mean, look at me, husband of the year. I
[03:37.520 --> 03:43.040]  bought her a coffee. Right. And it's only February. Yeah. Right. You can take the rest of the year off.
[03:43.040 --> 03:52.080]  You can take the rest of the year off. All right. So I think five minutes, which that's,
[03:52.080 --> 03:56.240]  you know, that's normal for getting a coffee. Well, I'm at the coffee shop,
[03:56.800 --> 04:05.920]  waiting for the macchiato. And my mom calls. My dad's not going to take five minutes. My dad
[04:05.920 --> 04:13.920]  handed her his iPad. And she said, and the thing at the top that you dragged down was already down.
[04:13.920 --> 04:21.920]  And I touched something and it went into dark mode. Now, why he handed her the iPad while
[04:21.920 --> 04:29.040]  control center was down. I don't know. But what I did is I thought, well, I know how to fix this.
[04:29.040 --> 04:35.920]  I was like, unfortunately, you know, none of the things in control center are labeled. They're all
[04:35.920 --> 04:44.560]  just icons. And I'm not quite sure how to describe the dark mode icon. Right. It's a circle that's
[04:44.560 --> 04:50.560]  half dark and the other half is inverted. I don't know if that's good enough for my mom. And I
[04:50.560 --> 04:56.080]  thought, I got it. I'll just show her on my phone. And I pulled down mine. I said, look, I'll just
[04:56.080 --> 05:00.800]  text you the answer standby. And I got off the phone, pulled down my control center, took a
[05:00.800 --> 05:08.560]  screenshot, took out the markup tools and drew like a red circle around the dark mode icon and
[05:08.560 --> 05:17.520]  said this. And then I texted it to her. She calls back as I'm on my way home. Dad doesn't have that
[05:17.520 --> 05:25.680]  icon. Well, but that's, I said, but this, that whole can, that's called control center with all
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.400]  these things. She goes, yes, I know that that's what it was. And it was open when he handed me
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.320]  the iPad and I touched something and put it into dark mode. And I said, well, then he has to have
[05:36.320 --> 05:42.400]  that icon. I said, the colors might be reversed because it's, you know, don't, don't, it may not
[05:42.400 --> 05:46.560]  look exactly the same because the screenshot I sent you was light mode. And then I'm suddenly
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.560]  cursing myself for not having put my phone into dark mode before digging the screenshot. Right.
[05:52.560 --> 05:57.600]  And I want to, I want to, I want to, I emphasize here, my, my mom is a very smart woman. She's a
[05:57.600 --> 06:04.000]  very bright woman, but she is very, very, uh, not good with computers. Yeah. And, and very,
[06:04.000 --> 06:09.040]  she lacks confidence in them. And, and that's the thing as like, yeah, that's the huge difference.
[06:09.040 --> 06:18.400]  She would just try. She could figure it out, but yeah. Well, eventually, and this is, this took
[06:18.400 --> 06:23.520]  several minutes. I'll skip it. I figure out that his phone or his iPad was not in dark mode.
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.160]  She had turned the brightness all the way down. Oh.
[06:31.520 --> 06:37.520]  But she's the one who mentioned dark mode. I actually, now that I think about it, I don't think
[06:37.520 --> 06:46.080]  she actually has any idea what capital D, yeah, capital D, capital M dark mode is. Yeah. She
[06:46.080 --> 06:51.760]  it's just a comedy of errors that she literally chose the words dark mode to describe what happens
[06:51.760 --> 06:58.800]  when you turn an iPad's brightness all the way down. And then I said, oh, okay.
[07:01.840 --> 07:05.360]  There it's the brightness. Yeah. There's like another screenshot. Well, I didn't take a
[07:05.360 --> 07:10.560]  screenshot because at this point I was like overdue. I was already home. I had given Amy
[07:10.560 --> 07:17.520]  her coffee and I'm just packing up my MacBook to take it down to this, my podcast cave to do this
[07:17.520 --> 07:23.120]  with you. And I'm already a little embarrassed because I've put you out longer than we're going
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.160]  to record, which is actually possibly a long time. And I said, it's a larger button. It's like a
[07:30.720 --> 07:37.440]  capsule shaped button, double the height of the regular buttons. And it has an icon that looks
[07:37.440 --> 07:42.160]  like the sun and it's a slider. Just drag it up. And she goes, he doesn't have that one.
[07:45.280 --> 07:50.960]  And she said, he has a moon. He doesn't have a sun. And, and, and at this point,
[07:50.960 --> 07:57.360]  Amy's like dying of laughter. And she's, she's, she says, it's right next to the moon.
[07:58.160 --> 08:03.680]  And I said, yes, it's right next to the moon. And she goes, no. And I said, well,
[08:03.680 --> 08:08.800]  you probably can't see the sun icon very well because, because you have it all the way down
[08:08.800 --> 08:15.840]  all the way down past it. And she goes, no. And I said, I'm telling you, there's an oblong button,
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.840]  double the height of the moon. I said, you see the moon one? Yes. To the right, there's a,
[08:21.840 --> 08:28.160]  there's a another button. It is twice the height of it. It's probably all dark. Just put your
[08:28.160 --> 08:33.840]  finger on it and slide up. And then she did it and it solved all the problems. And she's very gracious
[08:33.840 --> 08:39.600]  and, and there's why I'm like, because my mom put my dad's iPad in dark mode. Yeah.
[08:39.600 --> 08:45.360]  I didn't realize if you long press that it, um, it opens up and gives you dark mode on and off
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.160]  and night shift on and off. I didn't know that. Yeah. There we go. There's a hot tip. I just
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.440]  tried that. So she could have turned on dark mode, even though his icon wasn't on there.
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.400]  Huh? How about that? So you don't need the dark mode. No. Yeah. Cause it's already there. Yeah.
[08:58.400 --> 09:02.240]  I mean, you have to long press, but that's not. Yeah. There we go. Well, there's,
[09:02.240 --> 09:10.640]  there's the talk show tip of the week. How are you doing, John? I'm fine. Yeah. It's a beautiful
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.720]  day here. It's it's not, it's, uh, I think it's like 55 today. Uh, sunny, like crazy.
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.400]  We've been all over though. You know what? It was very, uh, it was, it was, uh,
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.360]  it was sunny, which is, you know, that's all you can ask for in February on the East coast.
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.320]  And we've had the most remarkably wild, mild winter. You could imagine we've had some cold
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.560]  weather, but we have had zero snow, zero ice. Like I just realized, you know, cause some of this,
[09:36.560 --> 09:43.680]  uh, renovation work we're having, we're letting them use our garage, you know, to, to store stuff
[09:43.680 --> 09:51.040]  around our car. And so it's like, it's like an obstacle course. And I thought that's where we
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.440]  keep this, the rock salt. And I was just reading an article about, Hey, how come the East coast
[09:55.440 --> 10:00.480]  hasn't had any snow? And I thought, uh, Hey shoot, where's the snow? Where's the salt?
[10:00.480 --> 10:05.760]  Uh, and then I realized, you know what, forget it. I don't even care where it is. Cause I remember
[10:05.760 --> 10:13.200]  last year I ran out of salt and it was a bad storm and I just, I just, I just, I just, I just,
[10:13.200 --> 10:17.760]  and I just went to around the corner is the advantage of living in the city. I just walked
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.360]  around the corner and they had like plenty of it. And I thought, well, there's my salt.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.120]  I'll just buy, just store it there. Yeah, exactly. I just store it at the,
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.880]  the corner. Oh, that's why they call it a store. Right. And I just remember thinking when I went
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.320]  to buy it, you know, it's like, uh, you know, uh, buying an umbrella and a rainstorm. It's like,
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.920]  either they're going to like gouge me or they're going to be out, but it was wonderful. They had
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.040]  like, they had like an entire pallet piled up with it. They were like ready for everybody in
[10:47.040 --> 10:50.960]  the neighborhood to need salt. And I was like, Oh, so I don't have to worry about it. But anyway,
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.800]  it just got me thinking that, uh, we have had a very strange winter here on the East coast.
[10:56.800 --> 11:01.520]  Yeah. I mean, I guess I can't complain. I mean, it's like, if we're going to have screwed up
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.760]  climate and destroy the entire planet for all life, at the very least, I haven't had to shovel
[11:07.760 --> 11:19.120]  any snow. I guess. Yeah. Um, is that, is that a thing that we should be happy about? Uh, well,
[11:19.120 --> 11:22.640]  I guess does that, does that really make it better? I mean, maybe it makes it better in
[11:22.640 --> 11:26.000]  the short term, but in the long term, it doesn't make it any better. Well, everybody said, well,
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  I guess everybody says that, you know, calling it global warming was sort of a mistake at the
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.840]  beginning. Climate change is a better term. Cause that sounds good. Right. And one of the side
[11:33.840 --> 11:39.520]  effects has nothing to do with the temperature. Well, it's caused by the temperature overall.
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.880]  It is global warming. It's like a one or two centigrade increase over time. And that's enough
[11:44.880 --> 11:52.000]  to cause all sorts of havoc with ice caps, melting and extra water and sea levels rising and currents
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  changing and all of these weird things, including as predicted the increase in extreme slash weird
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.600]  weather, bigger, worse hurricanes and, and tsunamis and stuff like that. And just weird
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.040]  weather like dry, you know, these, these droughts that are plaguing California with these terrible
[12:11.040 --> 12:17.600]  fires and et cetera, et cetera. So I, you know, and again, it could just be, you know, there have
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.880]  been, you know, like in my childhood weird winters where there was never any snow, which felt like a
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.120]  ripoff, you know? Yeah. It always felt like, yeah. I feel like when I was a kid, I felt like,
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.480]  I mean, looking back on it in my memory, it was like, it started snowing the first day of
[12:32.480 --> 12:39.120]  November and it snowed all the way through the first day of April. Which of course was not true
[12:39.120 --> 12:46.000]  in any regard, but you know, in Connecticut, we got, we got some good snows and, and made some
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.880]  big snow forts too. But you don't get, we don't get that much here in Washington. Although we've
[12:50.880 --> 12:57.680]  had, we've had some snow. I think Hank has had a couple of snow days this year already. Probably
[12:57.680 --> 13:04.560]  won't have any more, but still, we don't usually get a lot of snow. And that's, you know, and it's
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.120]  not to say that it was a lot, but it's just that they don't have, we can't handle it out here. So
[13:09.120 --> 13:16.160]  when we get any snow, they usually get the day off. So how have you been? I guess I asked that
[13:16.160 --> 13:22.640]  already. Yeah, you did, but I'm still fine. In the three minutes since you asked me last,
[13:22.640 --> 13:33.760]  I'm still fine. It's a good thing that your mom didn't have a question about multitasking
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.000]  on the iPad. You know what I've told, did I, was this on the podcast or when I wrote,
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  I wrote about it. She did have problems with it. And she, she did. She had profound problems with
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.400]  it where she, and to me, the, it was the, exhibit A in the case against the multitasking interface
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.480]  as it stands and having it on by default where she's, she's a prototypical, very simple iPad
[14:00.480 --> 14:08.560]  user who really just uses Safari mail messages and you know, maybe some games. Although I think,
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.240]  yeah, yeah, she plays like words with friends and like a handful of games, but Safari lots,
[14:14.240 --> 14:22.320]  she's an avid reader, a consumer of news, mail and messages and somehow going from
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.400]  mail where she, she, and she's one of these, she likes to sign up for like newsletters from CNN
[14:28.400 --> 14:33.120]  and stuff like that. I mean, it's, which, you know, I guess that's why they offer them,
[14:34.320 --> 14:42.400]  but somehow would continuously wind up with two instances of Safari, including one that was in
[14:42.400 --> 14:48.800]  the sidebar, you know, and not having no idea how to get out of it. And she found the setting
[14:48.800 --> 14:54.560]  in general settings, general, you know, home screen and multitasking, I think is the section.
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.840]  It's not even inaccessibility. It's like in the home screen and, you know, allow multiple apps
[14:59.840 --> 15:04.000]  or something like that. And she turned it off and now her iPad works exactly as she wants it to.
[15:04.000 --> 15:16.320]  Well, that's good. So she didn't have to call you then? No. I got, I got a couple of things.
[15:16.320 --> 15:21.840]  You see the agenda? I'm actually somewhat organized. I guess we should start with the
[15:21.840 --> 15:32.400]  sad news, right? Larry Tesler died unexpectedly. What's sad news? 75? 74. 74. And it was sort of
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.120]  unexpected. They didn't say what the cause was. I saw, I think it was the New York Times obituary
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.720]  from John Markoff said that he, he, his wife said they didn't know what caused his death,
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.400]  but that he had, he apparently had a bicycle accident a few years back and had never quite
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.160]  been right since. And I guess they, you know, I don't know, I don't want to read into it, but
[15:54.160 --> 16:00.880]  terribly sad. Too soon, you know? Yeah. But what a, what a, what a career and what an influence on,
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.720]  on the Mac interface. I mean, I had a couple of links on Daring Fireball about his influence, but
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.640]  it's so odd to me. And again, it's, you know, I don't want to make it all about me. It's,
[16:10.640 --> 16:16.560]  you know, Larry Tesler who died, but it's so odd that I really have been thinking a lot about him
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.200]  because I've been thinking and writing so much about this iPad multitasking stuff. And it really
[16:21.200 --> 16:28.960]  did occur to me before he died this week that his no modes mantra is sort of at the root of my
[16:28.960 --> 16:35.760]  complaint about the multitasking where it's these, it feels like going into a different mode for,
[16:36.560 --> 16:44.480]  for different things like putting two apps into side by side mode. I mean, there's no other way
[16:44.480 --> 16:49.440]  to call it than a mode is so weird because the first one you just tap the icon, which so far,
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.760]  so good. And then to get that second one, you have to do a tap and a hold on the icon in the,
[16:55.760 --> 17:02.080]  in the home tray or, you know, the dock, whatever you call it. Or as I found out from, from avid
[17:02.080 --> 17:09.440]  iPad users, you can go to spotlight and search for an app and from spotlight, you can tap and
[17:09.440 --> 17:15.440]  hold the app to put it. So it doesn't have to be in the dock, which I erroneously thought, but
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.080]  seemingly 90% of people who even know what iPad multitasking is also thought that you had to have
[17:22.080 --> 17:28.800]  the app in the dock because you can't just do it from the app on the home screen. So that's weird
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.680]  that the one way to get an app, the way to get the first app in split screen is one way and the other
[17:33.680 --> 17:40.720]  is another way. So that's a mode. And then the weird way that like, if you have an instance of
[17:40.720 --> 17:48.320]  Safari next to messages and another instance of Safari next to notes, you have to go to an
[17:48.320 --> 17:54.000]  entirely different mode to see them both at the same time, you have to swipe up and go into that
[17:54.000 --> 18:01.440]  multitasking mode, which sort of puts them in a three by two tiled arrangement that you can,
[18:01.440 --> 18:07.200]  you know, that makes it look like they're windows. But that the way that they're arranged
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.840]  isn't really spatially oriented in any way to the normal mode of using the iPad. Anyway,
[18:13.840 --> 18:21.120]  it's very modal. And I think it gets to the sort of heart of Tesla's life's work, arguing against
[18:21.120 --> 18:29.520]  modes. Yeah, I'm just I'm playing with it right now. I'm sorry, because I was trying to figure
[18:29.520 --> 18:34.320]  out what you mean with the part you're talking about with them. spotlight, because I've never I've
[18:34.320 --> 18:39.120]  never even tried that. Yeah, that's Isn't that weird? I mean, I guess that you could do it from
[18:39.120 --> 18:45.920]  there, but you can't do it from the home screen. I do think there's like the one thing that iPad
[18:45.920 --> 18:54.800]  multitasking as it stands today does get right, is that if you have if you if you have successfully
[18:54.800 --> 19:02.080]  navigated the maze to get the piece of cheese, to have two apps side by side on screen, right?
[19:02.080 --> 19:10.160]  Let's say you have notes on the left Safari on the right. And you would like to switch them to be the
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.440]  other way around. You would like, you know, just go take the one on the left, put it on the right
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.640]  and haven't go, you can actually do what you think you should be able to do, which is sort of tap in
[19:20.640 --> 19:27.520]  the dead space of the toolbar of one of the apps and hold and then just drag it over and it will
[19:27.520 --> 19:33.760]  do exactly what you think. But very little of iPad multitasking works that way where you just
[19:33.760 --> 19:40.800]  tap on the thing, the window, the tile, whatever you want to call it on screen, tap it, drag it
[19:40.800 --> 19:45.040]  over, and then the other one slides over to the other spot and does it but very little of it
[19:45.040 --> 19:52.400]  works that way. Yeah. And I am one of those people who has basically just given up on it. I don't
[19:52.400 --> 19:56.480]  the only time I mean, I haven't turned it off. And maybe I should because they really don't use it.
[19:56.480 --> 20:02.960]  But the only times I initiated are usually by accident. So yeah, I don't so I don't use it.
[20:02.960 --> 20:08.160]  I don't either although I'm keeping I still I still have it on because I want to write so much
[20:08.160 --> 20:16.000]  about it. So like if I if it wasn't my on my top of my mind to write about this, I would just turn
[20:16.000 --> 20:23.040]  I would just turn that setting off and relish the simplicity of never having to worry about anything
[20:24.320 --> 20:31.440]  going into a second instance. And it is I again, I there is something about my brain,
[20:31.440 --> 20:35.520]  maybe it's age, it might be, you know, I write about this, and it's inevitable that people start
[20:35.520 --> 20:40.320]  calling me the old, you know, whatever old man, you know, because I'm the old guy who only
[20:40.320 --> 20:49.440]  understands the Macintosh. But I do I keep forgetting that, like, when you somehow either
[20:49.440 --> 20:55.440]  purposefully or accidentally wind up with two instances of Safari, how do you get emerged back
[20:55.440 --> 21:03.840]  into one and it has nothing to do with the system wide multitasking interface it is. It's like in
[21:03.840 --> 21:11.600]  the tabs button inside Safari, you can press and hold the, you know what I mean? The tabs button?
[21:11.600 --> 21:18.400]  Yeah. I think you can press and hold and if you have multiple instances, you can Yeah. So you
[21:18.400 --> 21:23.520]  press and hold it. And normally it just says like, close all tabs, close this tab, open new window,
[21:23.520 --> 21:29.600]  new private tab, new tab. But if you have multiple instances of Safari, you can say merge all windows
[21:29.600 --> 21:35.440]  and it'll merge them. But which is great. So it's there. But I always forget how the hell to do it,
[21:35.440 --> 21:40.160]  because I don't think to do it within Safari, I feel like I should be able to do it at the
[21:40.160 --> 21:46.400]  system level. Yeah. Because I feel like it should work the same way for all apps. Although I guess
[21:46.400 --> 21:51.120]  Safari is different, because it actually has tabs. And if you have two instances of notes open,
[21:51.120 --> 21:58.560]  how do you merge them? Because that there's no way within one note, there's no tab. Yeah, right.
[21:58.560 --> 22:03.360]  You can't do it there. But the fact that none of that is consistent system-wide is the whole thing
[22:03.360 --> 22:07.280]  I'm arguing about, that this is not a small problem with a small solution. This is something
[22:07.280 --> 22:13.120]  that is fundamentally limited, that everything should be like Safari and have tabs or something
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.160]  like that. Again, it's not my job to come up with a solution, but it's my job to point out how
[22:19.680 --> 22:26.160]  problematic this is. I always forget. It's my job to remember stuff. I always forget. So there's my
[22:26.160 --> 22:34.320]  second, the talk show tip of the week. If you wind up with two Safari windows in iPad and don't
[22:34.320 --> 22:40.160]  want them, want them merged, go to one of them, go to the tabs button, press and hold, and there will
[22:40.160 --> 22:46.880]  be a merge all windows that'll do it. The good news is that it'll merge them in a way that is
[22:46.880 --> 22:59.120]  seemingly random in terms of the way the tabs show up next to each other. And so you get to play a
[22:59.120 --> 23:06.640]  game. Where's that tab? Find that tab. Find that tab. Yeah. Which is, you know, it's a very fun
[23:06.640 --> 23:11.120]  game. It's really, it should be part of Apple Arcade in my opinion. So it doesn't put it at
[23:11.120 --> 23:16.960]  the end. It just sticks it someplace in the middle? Is it doing it alphabetically?
[23:16.960 --> 23:21.920]  I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't seem rational to me. Maybe I'm wrong,
[23:21.920 --> 23:24.320]  but in my experience, it doesn't seem rational.
[23:25.600 --> 23:30.160]  Is it a function of having open, is it, I mean, is it still, I wonder if it's still like technically
[23:30.160 --> 23:38.560]  just another tab and it has an index that's still in, like, and if you open more tabs,
[23:38.560 --> 23:44.720]  then it's, they come after that one. I couldn't tell you. Yeah. I couldn't tell you. You had
[23:44.720 --> 23:48.960]  to test that several times to figure that out. Yeah. I couldn't tell you.
[23:55.040 --> 23:59.600]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. And I'm very excited. This is the first time
[23:59.600 --> 24:08.800]  they've sponsored a show. KOLIDE. K-O-L-I-D-E. I would have said KOLIDE. They've been sponsoring
[24:08.800 --> 24:14.960]  my website during Fireball for at least a year, maybe a little longer. They're a repeat sponsor
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.680]  on during Fireball. And I thank them for that. And I've been calling them KOLIDE in my mind
[24:20.800 --> 24:28.480]  for a very long time. And then I was listening to the ATP podcast where they sponsored and
[24:28.480 --> 24:35.440]  Marco said it was KOLIDE. And I thought, ooh, and I, cause I knew I had an upcoming note. I
[24:35.440 --> 24:40.480]  knew they were coming up. I knew they were coming up here on my show. And so I emailed them and
[24:40.480 --> 24:45.040]  they were, and, and they were very nice to me, but they acted like it was the dumbest question
[24:45.040 --> 24:51.360]  they ever heard. But anyway, I would think that these advertisers would start getting to know you
[24:52.560 --> 24:56.640]  and start sending pronunciations in advance. Yeah. Yeah. You know, like you would, you know,
[24:56.640 --> 25:04.400]  for, uh, you know, like a kindergarten, you know, reading, right. Anyway, KOLIDE, K-O-L-I-D-E.
[25:04.400 --> 25:10.880]  They are a software as a service startup. And, uh, oh, here it is in the notes pronounced KOLIDE.
[25:11.680 --> 25:17.680]  John, I swear to God, they did put this here. That is working to solve security challenges
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.600]  for tech companies that run large Mac fleets and use Slack. In the world of Mac management,
[25:23.600 --> 25:29.280]  the current accepted practice is to buy an MDM and then use it to lock down devices. So users
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.400]  can only do quote unquote safe things. The end result is that your users become frustrated
[25:34.400 --> 25:38.320]  and don't understand why their devices features and capabilities are turned off. Do this often
[25:38.320 --> 25:43.680]  enough, and they will start using their personal devices to actually get their work done. KOLIDE
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.320]  is different. KOLIDE believes that end user education about device security is the top
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.840]  priority. Instead of locking down the device, KOLIDE allows you to monitor it continuously
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.720]  to see if it is compliant with your security policy. If it isn't, KOLIDE will message your
[25:58.720 --> 26:05.920]  employees via Slack and walk them through the policy, why it is important and give them precise
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.800]  instructions on how to fix the issue themselves. KOLIDE will even message the user the instant
[26:10.800 --> 26:16.320]  they fix the problem so they know they did it right. KOLIDE does all of this by using an
[26:16.320 --> 26:24.160]  endpoint agent called OS Query, which is 100% open source, doesn't degrade the performance of your
[26:24.160 --> 26:29.600]  Macs, and provides important information to security analysts without violating the privacy
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.680]  of your end users. KOLIDE is free for your first 30 days across all of your devices. That includes
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.080]  Windows and Linux too, but they know my audience, probably a lot of Macs. And you can sign up on
[26:44.080 --> 26:52.080]  their website today at KOLIDE.com. K-O-L-I-D-E dot com. My thanks to KOLIDE.
[26:57.440 --> 26:58.800]  What else is on the agenda here?
[27:01.200 --> 27:04.560]  Are we done with iPad? I kind of think we should be because...
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.600]  Oh, did you want to mention, did you?
[27:07.600 --> 27:13.040]  Oh, yeah. Well, while we're talking about Larry Tesler, I just wanted to say, I thought there was
[27:13.040 --> 27:19.120]  one of the things I linked to was a tweet thread by Chris Espinosa, who's kind of been at Apple
[27:19.120 --> 27:27.920]  a long time. I think his employee number is six. I was going to say, seems like he's probably been
[27:27.920 --> 27:39.200]  there a while. And he's been there continuously. And who is also a very nice individual. I've met
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.480]  Chris a couple of times. But he had just a wonderful thread, very brief. I'll put it in
[27:44.480 --> 27:51.360]  the show notes. But I linked it on Daring Fireball about how all of the obituaries for Tesla are sort
[27:51.360 --> 27:58.320]  of leading with the inventor of cut, copy and paste, which I think he does deserve credit for.
[27:59.200 --> 28:03.760]  But he did so much more. But you know, I don't blame you. But I mean, how long is the headline
[28:03.760 --> 28:08.640]  going to be for an obituary? And it's not a bad thing in terms of letting, you know, like the
[28:08.640 --> 28:15.040]  readers of The New York Times, just have a stake in, hey, I didn't, you know, I think cut, copy and
[28:15.040 --> 28:21.360]  paste are so ingrained in our minds, that it's hard to remember. Yeah, it's hard to remember
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.240]  that they were an invention, you know, and that it was something worse. But that, you know, like
[28:26.240 --> 28:34.720]  prior, his anti-modality campaign was that, you know, word processors before the work that he and
[28:34.720 --> 28:43.120]  his team did at Xerox PARC had, they were so modal that they had different modes for adding text and
[28:43.120 --> 28:50.960]  different modes for editing text. Like, like, you know, like, think of the contacts app on iOS,
[28:50.960 --> 28:56.480]  you open up a contact, and it's read only, right? And then you hit an edit button at the top. And
[28:56.480 --> 29:01.280]  now you can edit the stuff and delete fields and add fields. And there's two modes. And you know,
[29:01.280 --> 29:05.440]  the modal thing doesn't mean that all modes are bad. Maybe that's actually a good selection for
[29:05.440 --> 29:09.200]  iOS, because you don't, you know, for something that you tap, maybe you don't want everything
[29:09.200 --> 29:16.720]  to be editable all the time. But it's kind of obvious. And, you know, I don't want to give
[29:16.720 --> 29:21.120]  short change to all of his work. But he even Larry Tesler would admit that doesn't mean never have a
[29:21.120 --> 29:26.320]  mode, just if you need one, don't use one unless you really need it. And if you do make it obvious
[29:26.320 --> 29:38.080]  how you get in, and how you get out. And Espinoza's thread just emphasized how, how thoughtful his
[29:38.080 --> 29:44.000]  stuff was. And it was about how in the early Macintosh, by this time, Tesla was at Apple,
[29:45.360 --> 29:53.280]  like around 1982, they were implementing copy and paste for text editing. And that they just
[29:53.280 --> 29:57.840]  inserted, they were happy enough the Mac team and then you know, this is a team full of real
[29:57.840 --> 30:03.600]  sticklers for, you know, trying to do insanely great work, as they said, they were just going
[30:03.600 --> 30:08.080]  to take a string of text and wherever the insertion point is, if you paste it, it would just
[30:08.080 --> 30:14.240]  add that string right there. And so if you were at the end of a word, and you were going to paste
[30:14.240 --> 30:20.480]  another word, the word would be right up against the previous word with no space in between it.
[30:20.480 --> 30:26.160]  And Tesla was like, no, no, that's not good enough. Right? Like, and Espinoza said, I was
[30:26.160 --> 30:31.040]  thinking like a programmer and a programmer thinks, I want the precision, I know that I have
[30:31.040 --> 30:40.480]  the string, M O L T Z on the clipboard, and the insertion point is right next to the N in j o h n.
[30:40.480 --> 30:46.880]  And if I paste, I expect moles to be right next to the john with no space, because if I wanted a
[30:46.880 --> 30:53.200]  space, I'd have typed a space. And that's the way a programmer thinks. And Tesla, you know, insisted
[30:53.200 --> 30:58.320]  he and he was thinking the way people think and the way people think is, I've got a name, I got
[30:58.320 --> 31:03.120]  a first name, and I got a second name on the clipboard. And when I paste, I would like it to
[31:03.120 --> 31:12.080]  look like a normal name, which is john space moles. And like, and then had the thoughtfulness to write
[31:12.080 --> 31:20.000]  it up in a heuristic that could be implemented programmatically in a way that wouldn't annoy
[31:20.720 --> 31:25.280]  the programmer types like Espinoza, who expected like, what do you know, and I think part of that
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.760]  heuristic is like, if you're in the middle of a word, and you paste, then it really does appear
[31:29.760 --> 31:35.520]  without spaces, because it assumes while you're in the middle of a word, right? It's just so many
[31:35.520 --> 31:41.040]  little details like that, that made the Mac great, right from day one, and you can attribute them to
[31:41.040 --> 31:48.640]  him. Yeah, I did not know until I read your blurb on during firewall that he had worked on the
[31:48.640 --> 31:54.640]  Newton as well. Oh, yeah, yeah, he was a I think that might have been the last big thing he did
[31:54.640 --> 31:59.120]  while at Apple. I know he was still in the advanced technology group after that,
[31:59.120 --> 32:02.480]  but in terms of stuff that actually shipped, that was part of it. Although I guess,
[32:03.200 --> 32:08.320]  no, that's not true. Because the the advanced technology group did work that led to Wi Fi and
[32:08.320 --> 32:13.280]  stuff like that. But yeah, he was definitely a big part of the Newton and the Newton was very,
[32:13.280 --> 32:21.680]  very anti modal in a great way. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, I always liked the cut, copy, and the cut
[32:21.680 --> 32:26.800]  and paste interface for that. Yeah, yeah, where you drag it to the side, and then you can still
[32:26.800 --> 32:32.080]  see it, you'll see the thing that you had, that you were going to move someplace else,
[32:32.080 --> 32:42.160]  and you move to the other place, and then you just drag it back in. Yeah. So anyway,
[32:42.160 --> 32:48.320]  RIP Larry Tesler, I've got more stuff saved up in tabs. So there'll be more stuff on during
[32:48.320 --> 32:58.480]  firewall. There's so much more to write about. But what a shame. Next on the agenda, what do we got?
[32:58.480 --> 33:04.880]  How about this? Do you see this malware bytes, quote, unquote, scandal last week? Yeah.
[33:06.080 --> 33:09.680]  Yeah, I tried to ignore it for a while, because it just made me angry. Yeah.
[33:11.680 --> 33:18.960]  It's one of those things where I started writing about it, and it was getting too long. I was like,
[33:18.960 --> 33:27.200]  this isn't worth me spending all this time on. And I wound up didn't link to it until just
[33:27.200 --> 33:30.800]  today. In fact, before we were getting ready for the show, and I just punted and
[33:32.160 --> 33:38.880]  just linked to Michael Tsai's write up, which has his usual amazing collection of commentary from
[33:38.880 --> 33:46.560]  around the web and Twitter. And Jason Snell did the yeoman's work of actually sort of writing
[33:46.560 --> 33:56.080]  about it intelligently. And it is. So basically, for those who didn't see it, the malware bytes
[33:56.080 --> 34:03.280]  labs make their money selling antivirus software. So I think it's fair to say there's a conflict of
[34:03.280 --> 34:12.160]  interest in terms of their interpretation of Mac users' needs for third party antivirus software.
[34:12.800 --> 34:18.320]  But they released their report on the 2020 state of Mac software and said, this is a quote from
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.080]  their report, Mac threats increased exponentially in comparison to those against Windows PCs in
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.600]  2020. While the overall volume of Mac threats increase year over year by more than 400%,
[34:30.640 --> 34:35.840]  that number is somewhat impacted by a larger malware bytes for Mac user base in 2019. However,
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.480]  when calculated in threats per endpoint, Mac still outpaced Windows by nearly two to one,
[34:42.960 --> 34:50.000]  which sounds really bad. And it's not nonsense or bullshit or made up, right?
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.520]  Right. It's not great either. Yeah, it's not great.
[34:54.160 --> 34:57.680]  Yeah. I mean, do you prefer the numbers would go down?
[34:57.680 --> 35:10.000]  Right. But it involves a broad interpretation of threats or Mac calling what you call malware,
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.520]  you know? And it's catnip for the tech press, right? And it has been, I mean, forever.
[35:19.520 --> 35:27.440]  I mean, going back till you and I started writing for the public, it has never not been a thing
[35:28.080 --> 35:40.880]  to try to make that the conventional wisdom is that Macs don't get malware and Windows gets
[35:40.880 --> 35:50.480]  malware. And that's the conventional wisdom. And then anything that refutes that is catnip
[35:50.480 --> 35:55.600]  to the tech press because it's a man bites dog story, right?
[35:55.600 --> 35:56.320]  Right. Yeah.
[35:58.640 --> 36:03.040]  And it always comes down to,
[36:03.040 --> 36:11.680]  at some point, there's somebody who will say Mac users or I can't, you know, somebody says that
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.040]  Macs, quote unquote, can't get malware, right? Which is something that nobody who knows what
[36:17.040 --> 36:24.080]  the hell they're talking about has ever said, right? Nobody's ever said it. It has never been
[36:24.080 --> 36:31.440]  true. Nobody's tried to say it's true. It does require nuance. And then so therefore we're
[36:31.440 --> 36:35.360]  already screwed. But basically…
[36:35.360 --> 36:41.680]  I feel like maybe early on, because the different disparity was so great, it did seem like,
[36:41.680 --> 36:48.480]  to some people, that the reason must be because Apple's coding was better, that Apple had fewer
[36:49.600 --> 36:57.920]  exploitable flaws or whatever, which was not the case. It was a lot of it was mostly because Windows
[36:57.920 --> 37:00.720]  just had the larger market share. And if you're going to write something, you're going to write
[37:00.720 --> 37:02.240]  something against Windows.
[37:02.240 --> 37:08.960]  No, I think it was true at one point. I think there was a point where Windows was more easily
[37:08.960 --> 37:15.120]  exploited by poor security practices on Windows part, that there were exploits, like exploits
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.840]  that would actually let a remote intruder take over the machine. To me, the canonical example
[37:21.840 --> 37:32.160]  of it is Word Office macro viruses, which were insidious. All you had to do was open
[37:32.880 --> 37:41.920]  a Word document with a macro virus. You just opened the.doc file and your machine was
[37:41.920 --> 37:48.160]  screwed. And it would spread, right? And that's the thing. We've sort of lost the meaning of
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.440]  virus in the computer sense, where it, you know, in the real world, the biological virus, which,
[37:53.440 --> 38:00.240]  unfortunately, we're going to, is on the agenda for today's show. But, you know, as we're reminded
[38:00.240 --> 38:07.600]  by the news around the world right now, a virus is a thing that spreads on its own, which is what
[38:07.600 --> 38:16.720]  makes it so insidious. And a computer virus should be, that's a term that should be used for a type
[38:16.720 --> 38:23.520]  of malware that spreads on its own, you know. And there was a time when, you know, and Max used to,
[38:24.640 --> 38:30.800]  a long time ago, Max had a terrible problem with viruses. There was a great app, what was his name,
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.360]  John Norstead, an app, free app called Disinfectant. Were you using a Mac back then?
[38:37.360 --> 38:47.120]  Do you remember Disinfectant? Disinfectant was amazing because Disinfectant was totally free,
[38:47.120 --> 38:55.840]  and it was totally unobtrusive on your Mac, and it totally worked. But there were viruses on the Mac
[38:56.640 --> 39:03.600]  that spread just by inserting a floppy disk. I mean, so it was literally the computing equivalent
[39:03.600 --> 39:13.920]  of an STD. If there was an infected Mac and you put a floppy disk in, that Mac would write the
[39:13.920 --> 39:20.000]  virus to the floppy disk, and then you would pop it out, and then you would put it into your Mac,
[39:20.000 --> 39:30.000]  and just by putting it in, your Mac would get the same virus. And it really was that little
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.880]  interactivity. Just put a floppy disk in an infected Mac, take it out, put it in another one,
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.120]  and the other Mac would have it. Disinfectant nuked all of them, and he kept it up to date.
[39:41.120 --> 39:46.240]  It was really great. But that, you know, that's a real, that was a real problem that the Mac
[39:46.240 --> 39:51.360]  faced in the early 90s, like when I was at Drexel University, and we didn't really, we didn't have
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.080]  a network at the time. We had to get software. You'd go to the computer lab, and the way you got,
[39:56.080 --> 40:03.120]  like, software that was site licensed for the whole university for Mac users, or even courseware,
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.120]  like, you know, like your professor would say, go to the computer lab with a floppy disk and,
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.120]  you know, put in your course number and you'll get all this stuff. Like, you know, some courses,
[40:11.120 --> 40:15.520]  you know, had like custom hypercard stacks. It was, it was kind of an amazing time to be a Mac
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.680]  user at college. But, you know, part of the thing was that if you, you had to have disinfectant
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.720]  because, you know, and all of the lab machines had disinfectant, but they would tell you sometimes,
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.720]  like, you know, I was, you know, didn't happen to me because I'm me, but I had friends who'd be
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.840]  like, holy shit, I put my floppy in, and it told me my floppy was infected, you know, and I was
[40:37.840 --> 40:43.920]  like, yeah, you got to get disinfectant. So anyway, I've never ever, ever, I mean, this was, that was
[40:43.920 --> 40:52.400]  like 1991, 1992. Like, I've known for, God, that's close to 30 years that Macs have never, quote,
[40:52.400 --> 41:00.240]  unquote, not gotten malware. But the stuff that, that faces the Mac today is not viruses. It's not
[41:00.240 --> 41:06.400]  things that spread without you doing anything. Like you just, you know, it's all, I don't know
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.960]  what you want to call it, scamware, trickware. Yeah, I think they use adware, but it's, but
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.480]  it's a variety of different, it's not just things that show pop-up ads or something. Yeah, Dan Gooden
[41:18.480 --> 41:26.240]  at Ars Technica had a good piece just at the end of January about this, this sort of, and some of
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.760]  them, they look so bad, but, but basically there's a whole bunch of them are just fake Adobe Flash
[41:31.760 --> 41:39.040]  installers, and that's particularly insidious, kind of obvious, kind of clever, but for anybody
[41:39.040 --> 41:45.440]  who is a non-expert Mac user, who's been a non-expert Mac user for, let's say, 10 years or
[41:45.440 --> 41:49.200]  more, which at this point is an awful lot of people, right? There was an awful lot of people
[41:49.200 --> 41:56.560]  who became Mac users in the mid 2000s, the aughts, as we call them, you know, right around, you know,
[41:56.560 --> 42:04.320]  when the Intel switch happened. And in that era, it was very common for you to be browsing the web
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.880]  and be told your Flash is out of date, go here and a Flash, you know, and, and, and you, you weren't
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.280]  being tricked. You were getting a legitimate update to the Flash installer, and it would show
[42:15.280 --> 42:21.840]  a dialog box that you had to click through to get an updated version of Flash installed because you
[42:21.840 --> 42:25.760]  needed- Because Flash itself was telling you, right? It could be because you'd go to a site
[42:25.760 --> 42:30.720]  and it would, it would automatically start playing something in Flash and Flash would say, oh, you,
[42:30.720 --> 42:34.800]  you can't see this because you're out of date. Right. And, and then it would download a thing
[42:34.800 --> 42:41.040]  and show you a Flash. So that's a thing that Mac users, non-expert Mac users have, have thought is,
[42:41.040 --> 42:46.240]  you know, have done and needed to do. And so now, even though Flash is, I think it's-
[42:46.240 --> 42:50.800]  Well, that's what's so funny about it now. It's, it's in a way, I mean, every time I go to a site
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.320]  and something like that pops up, I just, I think it's so cute because I haven't run Flash in 10
[42:56.320 --> 43:04.240]  years probably. It's like telling you, you need to install disinfectant. I mean, it's, it's belongs
[43:04.240 --> 43:12.160]  in a museum. Your zip drive is out of date. Right. I mean, it's almost like, it's like we, we, we
[43:12.160 --> 43:22.880]  have as a, as an industry successfully eliminated Adobe Flash, like 99.9% of it. I can't remember
[43:22.880 --> 43:26.400]  the last time I've seen anything that wants it. I don't even know. I don't think it runs on the
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.400]  latest versions of Safari. I don't even think you can install it if you wanted to.
[43:31.280 --> 43:34.560]  Oh yeah. I don't know about that actually. That may be true. I mean,
[43:34.560 --> 43:37.680]  yeah, I mean, it hasn't come in default for years and years.
[43:37.680 --> 43:41.520]  I don't think it even runs anymore. I can't remember the last time anything has ever even
[43:41.520 --> 43:47.360]  asked me to install it legitimately, but it's the gift that keeps on giving in terms of people,
[43:47.360 --> 43:53.040]  you know, again, to go back, does my mom know that she doesn't have Flash anymore? That she doesn't
[43:53.040 --> 43:57.040]  need Flash? Of course not. You know, she has no idea what the hell Flash was except that every
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.600]  once in a while she needed to update it or else she couldn't, you know, watch video on CNN.
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.280]  And so that's one of the ways they do it. So they trick you. It's not actually Flash.
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.720]  It is, you know, some kind of scam adware, but they get you to click through it and give the,
[44:12.720 --> 44:18.640]  you know, the permission to do it and it's insidious. And Apple is on it. That's the
[44:18.640 --> 44:22.640]  other thing that Malwarebytes doesn't, you know, that's sort of disingenuous about the whole story
[44:22.640 --> 44:27.840]  that, hey, you need Malwarebytes third-party antivirus. Apple, you know, for all the complaints
[44:27.840 --> 44:33.920]  we have about Apple software of late, Apple is on top of this. And if anything, in my opinion,
[44:33.920 --> 44:37.680]  my complaints have been that they're too on top of it and making things too difficult
[44:37.680 --> 44:44.880]  for expert Mac users who really do trust and are careful about what they install outside the app
[44:44.880 --> 44:51.520]  store on their Macs, that they've gone too hard, too far in the direction of protecting against
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.120]  stuff like this. And even just in November, they've changed the rules on what they're saying
[44:57.120 --> 45:02.560]  is disallowed through the mandatory notarization process and what they're going to, you know,
[45:02.560 --> 45:09.280]  revoke the license to, you know, that it's pretty much anything that is a scam is what they're
[45:09.280 --> 45:14.480]  saying, you know, and there's a document that Apple published in November that, to me, they're
[45:14.480 --> 45:22.320]  on top of it. And basically Michael Tsai's conclusion is mine as well, that I still, I really
[45:22.320 --> 45:29.440]  don't think, I think that, I really don't think that anybody, expert or typical Mac user, needs
[45:29.440 --> 45:36.240]  third-party antivirus software and that it causes more problems than it fixes, that what the best
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.600]  course of action for most people is to run with Apple's default settings, which are pretty strict
[45:41.600 --> 45:48.640]  about, does the Mac now default to only installing from the app store? Like, I think you even have to
[45:48.640 --> 45:55.040]  click something. I think so. Yeah, I think that's right. And then the only other option is, well,
[45:55.040 --> 46:02.080]  without futzing around, right, is the Mac store and verified developers, right? Right. And the
[46:02.080 --> 46:09.440]  thing that if you download from outside the app store, you have to, like, control-click the app
[46:09.440 --> 46:16.000]  and choose open or select it and go to the gear menu in the finder and select open. If you just
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.040]  double-click it, it'll give you a dialog that says you can't run it because it can't be verified.
[46:21.040 --> 46:28.000]  Can't be verified. And that is a very good, and that's a very good solution in my opinion
[46:29.040 --> 46:36.160]  to keep typical users from accidentally opening something they shouldn't, but allowing an expert
[46:36.160 --> 46:43.920]  user to open, like, a homemade app that you just wrote for yourself or a friend wrote in Xcode or,
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.600]  like, an AppleScript applet that isn't signed or something like that, but you know you can trust
[46:49.600 --> 46:56.080]  it. And you're just enough of a Mac nerd to know what control-clicking on an app is, and you can
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.040]  choose open, and then it'll still give you a confirmation dialog, but that confirmation dialog
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.680]  will give you the extra button that says openness anyway. I trust it. I mean, that's not the exact
[47:05.680 --> 47:11.680]  terms, but it's what it means. But not letting you do it by simply double-clicking the app
[47:11.680 --> 47:24.160]  is a terrific defense. Anyway, Apple's on top of it, and I think it's kind of BS. And I pity them,
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.320]  I guess, because they're the ones who chose to get into the Mac antivirus software thing, but
[47:29.280 --> 47:36.000]  you really don't need it. Yeah. I mean, I personally have not had a—knock on wood—had a
[47:36.000 --> 47:45.440]  virus, yeah, probably since the 90s, right? Since the early 90s, since that time. And now, my kid
[47:45.440 --> 47:51.040]  is another matter because, you know, during his Minecraft heyday, of course, he was going to any
[47:51.040 --> 47:56.960]  and every site that he could find to download mods and things like that. And so, he managed to screw
[47:56.960 --> 48:10.560]  up a Mac really badly. But that's a whole other set of impulses. And that was a number of years.
[48:10.560 --> 48:16.640]  That was at least three or four years ago. But there is a good power tool analogy that
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.200]  you need to be able to make a mess of things with a saw to be able to use a saw, right? I mean,
[48:23.200 --> 48:29.120]  there's certain tools that need, you know, you need to be able to shoot yourself in the foot.
[48:30.880 --> 48:34.480]  That's maybe a bad example, but— Right. You need to be able to—
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.240]  You won't respect a gun until you've been shot by one.
[48:40.240 --> 48:46.960]  You need to be able to drill a screw into your own hand. But you do, right? I mean, you can,
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.560]  you know, a hammer is a perfect example. I mean, you can't build a hammer that would function
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.840]  without making a hammer that would allow you to smash your thumb. But it would be nice if you
[48:57.840 --> 49:03.200]  don't ever actually need to drive a nail into the wall to have a similar tool that would never allow
[49:03.200 --> 49:09.760]  you to smash your thumb. You know, the analogy breaks down, I guess, at some point. But we do
[49:09.760 --> 49:15.680]  need to have computers that we can mess up. But most people ought to have a computer that they
[49:15.680 --> 49:23.600]  can't mess up, is a broad way of putting it. I would say the same thing. I mean, my son has
[49:23.600 --> 49:32.560]  a gaming PC now as well. And I think it's true of modern Windows as well. And I did some research
[49:32.560 --> 49:38.800]  on it, and so far so good. But, you know, the old mantra, and I think a lot of Mac users, people
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.240]  who've lived their lives in the Apple ecosystem, you know, and internalized it, that Windows is
[49:44.240 --> 49:51.120]  virus-ridden and exploit-ridden, and you can't use Windows without some kind of third-party antivirus.
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.120]  I don't think that's true either. I think Microsoft Defender, which is their built-in,
[49:55.120 --> 50:04.000]  you know, antivirus, is, you know, and Jonas has had his PC now since Christmas of last year. So,
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.520]  what, 14 months? And, you know, it seemingly is in tip-top shape. You know, we had to remove Norton.
[50:11.520 --> 50:20.720]  That was fun. And I, you know, I did just, you know, I wish that Jonas was more, I don't know
[50:20.720 --> 50:26.800]  how Hank is, but Jonas just wants to play the games. He really is. That's exactly how Hank is.
[50:28.400 --> 50:35.600]  And so, and Jonas is nerdy about the games, and he and his pals, even though they're,
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.080]  Jonas and Hank are either very similarly-aged or identically. Yeah, they're pretty close, yeah.
[50:40.080 --> 50:46.640]  Jonas is in 10th grade. Yeah, that Hank is in 10th grade. Yeah. And I thought it was really cool,
[50:46.640 --> 50:52.320]  is that Jonas and his pals got back into Minecraft this year. Like, Minecraft is, like,
[50:52.320 --> 50:57.200]  such an epic game. Oh, really? I mean, it's ridiculous to think that, I mean, we spent,
[50:57.200 --> 51:02.560]  you know, we both got licenses for it for, like, 26, 28 bucks or something like that.
[51:02.560 --> 51:07.600]  And the amount of gameplay. It's insane. It is absolutely. And they never, they've never asked
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.040]  for an upgrade. It's just like, you get a license, and then, you know, sure, you're okay, you got the
[51:11.040 --> 51:16.320]  game. Yeah. You know, and then they just keep pumping out updates to it. Yeah. For, like,
[51:16.320 --> 51:25.520]  nothing. Yeah. And Jonas and his pals, they know Minecraft the way, like, I knew the Mac and, like,
[51:25.520 --> 51:29.920]  knew how to use ResEdit to go in and change icons. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know,
[51:29.920 --> 51:36.240]  the way that I knew how to deconstruct the classic Mac and thought it endlessly fascinating is,
[51:36.240 --> 51:40.560]  you know, like, and he'll get into games like that, but he has absolutely zero interest in
[51:40.560 --> 51:48.640]  getting into the computer itself that way. And, you know, so I, it was up to me, who has no
[51:48.640 --> 51:54.800]  interest in Microsoft Windows at all, like, to figure out, is this, am I right that we want to,
[51:54.800 --> 52:00.640]  we don't want any third party antivirus, we want to just use this Microsoft Defender,
[52:00.640 --> 52:06.400]  and is the right way to do it to just de-install this crapware that came installed? Or do I want
[52:06.400 --> 52:12.640]  to wipe the computer and start over with a fresh installation, blah, blah, blah. And, yeah, I was
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.040]  like, well, it's a Christmas gift. So I guess it's, you know, my gift to you is I'll do the
[52:17.040 --> 52:22.400]  work for you and figure it out. But anyway, that's true. It seems to be true. It's true.
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.640]  And I've read other people. I mean, they are in effect using some sort of antivirus,
[52:26.640 --> 52:30.400]  you're just using what came with the you're not using third party antivirus. Right. And I think
[52:30.400 --> 52:36.320]  that what comes with it is actually superior. It's not like, you know, you're, you're, it's not like
[52:36.320 --> 52:43.520]  you're using text edit instead of a proper word processor, like pages or Microsoft Word, it,
[52:43.520 --> 52:47.840]  you're not using a cut down thing, you're using something that is expertly designed
[52:47.840 --> 52:54.160]  to have no impact on your computing while doing anything legitimately, but to identify you of
[52:54.160 --> 52:58.000]  anything that is actually problematic, if you download it and double click it or something
[52:58.000 --> 53:05.680]  like that, and gets regular updates automatically with no interaction on your own to stay up to date.
[53:06.880 --> 53:13.200]  Yeah, I would honestly say that Microsoft and and Apple have are very much on equal footing
[53:13.200 --> 53:19.040]  and deserve a grades for staying on top of this stuff and protecting most users in a way that's
[53:19.680 --> 53:28.560]  unobtrusive. You know, it's, you know, it's always the complaint, you know, and I say this, and I
[53:28.560 --> 53:38.640]  I say this, you know, with sympathy to people who get Sherlock to, you know, in the, the, the,
[53:38.640 --> 53:45.040]  you know, as we say in the Mac community from the Watson app that did something and an Apple
[53:45.040 --> 53:50.560]  came out with an app called Sherlock. I mean, it is pretty bad that that was the name.
[53:50.560 --> 53:53.520]  Yeah, the naming choices particularly egregious.
[53:53.520 --> 53:59.680]  Right. So it's, you know, but that makes it a long story that would, you know, to fully tell. But
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.080]  anyway, there was an app called Watson, if you weren't around in the mid 2000s, and it was so
[54:04.080 --> 54:10.560]  sort of a way to intelligently search things on the web without just being textual, like searching
[54:10.560 --> 54:17.280]  through a search engine. It delivered things into, I don't know what you call it, little nuggets,
[54:17.280 --> 54:22.080]  like, you know, the weather would show up as an actual, you know, weather thing that would tell
[54:22.080 --> 54:29.200]  you the weather. And it was a third party software and from what was it, Karelia. And then Apple came
[54:29.200 --> 54:34.960]  out with a big Mac OS X update that included an app called Sherlock, which pretty much did the
[54:34.960 --> 54:42.080]  same thing. And it was included in the system. And ever since having a piece of third party
[54:42.080 --> 54:49.680]  software be obviated, to at least some degree, if not entirely, but enough to make, you know,
[54:49.680 --> 54:54.720]  make it untenable as a commercial effort. The verb is Sherlocked.
[54:54.720 --> 55:04.640]  And I have sympathy for it. But my rule of thumb is if it belongs in the system, it will eventually
[55:04.640 --> 55:14.960]  be in the system. And I don't know if I'll find it. I'll try to make a note and see if I can find
[55:14.960 --> 55:20.000]  it. But there was a thread recently about this. I forget what the context was on Twitter.
[55:20.000 --> 55:26.320]  But somebody with longer memory than me was bringing up ads from like the early PC era,
[55:26.320 --> 55:35.040]  like 1983, like a 1983 ad in Byte magazine, where there was a third party utility you could buy
[55:35.920 --> 55:42.720]  that would allow you to print Lotus one, two, three spreadsheets in portrait, or I mean landscape.
[55:42.720 --> 55:49.760]  Because at the time, Lotus could only print, you know, in eight and a half by 11, would be eight
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.080]  and a half by 11, as opposed to 11 by eight and a half. And if you had a wide spreadsheet,
[55:54.640 --> 55:58.800]  well, then that didn't work. And you could buy a third party utility that would let you do it.
[55:59.760 --> 56:02.320]  Well, should, you know.
[56:03.440 --> 56:04.960]  Yeah, right. Exactly.
[56:04.960 --> 56:10.880]  Is it a rip off? Is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a, is it a,
[56:10.880 --> 56:17.840]  is it a rip off? Is it a, is it a, some kind of unethical act when Lotus added the ability to
[56:17.840 --> 56:22.640]  print in portrait? No. You know, if it belongs in the system or belongs in the app, the third
[56:22.640 --> 56:29.200]  party opportunity, you know, isn't going to last for long. And so if you're a third party developer,
[56:29.200 --> 56:37.040]  you should either recognize, if your, your product is a great idea, you should recognize it.
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.440]  That if, if it seems like such a great idea that it might be part of the system,
[56:41.440 --> 56:47.360]  then you should recognize that and be prepared to move on or do it in such a way that it's so,
[56:47.360 --> 56:52.160]  has such depth that the solution from Apple would never have that much depth,
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.240]  but the power users will continue wanting, you know, there'll still be a market for your
[56:56.240 --> 57:03.040]  solution. I don't know if it's just retrospective, if it seems so obvious that you should be able to
[57:03.040 --> 57:12.160]  print a spreadsheet in landscape. But then, cause you run, that seems, that seems like,
[57:12.160 --> 57:17.840]  yeah, of course you should be able to do that. But then you start thinking about like the tile thing
[57:17.840 --> 57:25.920]  and whether or not does, does it, does it make sense for a, you know, a little doohickey that
[57:25.920 --> 57:31.200]  you can attach to things that you can find them to be sort of baked into the operating system too.
[57:31.200 --> 57:33.760]  Trenton Larkin Right. Right. So you're talking about that,
[57:33.760 --> 57:38.560]  is that really like, you know, is that really something that necessitates being in the operating
[57:38.560 --> 57:42.880]  system? Yeah, I think that's the context of the Twitter discussion. I was thinking it was this,
[57:42.880 --> 57:49.600]  yeah, the antitrust case where, where Congress had invited tile among others to, to come to,
[57:49.600 --> 57:55.280]  to levy their complaints about Apple and other tech giants. And, and yeah, yeah, you know,
[57:55.280 --> 58:01.760]  I mean, it seems, I don't know. It's a weird, it's a weird question. And it does,
[58:01.760 --> 58:06.800]  it seems like the kind of question about like, what, what is art? Yeah. You know, I mean,
[58:06.800 --> 58:13.600]  I don't know what I could, the, the, the spreadsheet scene thing seems obvious to me,
[58:13.600 --> 58:21.040]  and this seems less obvious. But you know, they, these, it seems like it, to me, it seems like
[58:21.040 --> 58:27.120]  it's perfectly fine for Apple to ship this thing. But it also seems like maybe it should be something
[58:27.120 --> 58:33.520]  that you might have to download from the App Store instead of it coming with, you know,
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.560]  the operating system. Yeah. And it's, you know, we could go on and on and on about it and skip
[58:38.560 --> 58:43.680]  the rest of the show and talk about how, you know, I know that I went back and forth with
[58:43.680 --> 58:50.880]  Nilay Patel from The Verge on it, where he's, you know, and again, it's not a bad, this isn't like,
[58:50.880 --> 58:54.960]  oh, I disagree. And we're on opposite sides. And we hate each other. Let's, you know, yeah,
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.920]  that's getting a fistfight. It's, you know, it's a rational discussion, which is actually,
[58:59.920 --> 59:05.200]  isn't it enjoyable? I think we could still have a discussion where we're trying to work it out.
[59:05.200 --> 59:11.680]  Yeah. And, and well, and acknowledge that both have good points. But Apple Watch is a good
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.200]  example where Nilay's perspective is that it's, I don't know if he would call, I don't want to put
[59:17.200 --> 59:22.800]  words in his mouth, but anti-competitive, at least in the lowercase a sense, not the capital A, like
[59:22.800 --> 59:29.280]  this should be legal, illegal, but that is anti-competitive, that Apple Watch integrates
[59:29.280 --> 59:37.760]  with iOS on your phone at a level that no third party watch can access, right? So like,
[59:37.760 --> 59:46.000]  you know, no matter what Samsung does with a smartwatch, the only thing that they could
[59:46.000 --> 59:53.600]  get installed on an iPhone is an app from the App Store. And there is no way that an app from the
[59:53.600 --> 01:00:03.040]  App Store sandboxed can offer the level of integration that iOS and Apple Watch have,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:13.200]  which is way outside the bounds of what an app can do. But the reason for that isn't
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.160]  anti-competitive, like the result is anti-competitive, but it's not like Apple
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:25.920]  is spiting these companies. It's because if apps from the App Store were allowed to install
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:33.360]  system-level background daemons that do the things like, hey, I'll just install the WatchOS
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:40.480]  at four in the morning while you're, once your watch is on the charger and, you know, your phone
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.640]  is on a charger, and I know that, you know, I can tell from your, you know, the patterns of when
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.840]  you're, you know, that's very likely that you're asleep, I'll just do the, you know, software update
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:58.720]  then. It would be great if you could promise that the third parties would only use it for
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.200]  features like that. But if that potential was there, it would be used for all sorts of havoc,
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:09.200]  which we know from the last 20 years of computing. I mean, it calls back to the malware bytes thing
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.440]  where, you know, people would install software and it would install all sorts of shit in the
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:22.320]  background. And, you know, the lack of sandboxing and apps, it was just out of control in terms of
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:29.360]  how much stuff apps would do that was running in the background. And, you know, you don't want
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.840]  that, you know. So what's the solution? I mean, it sort of stinks. I mean, I don't think there's
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:40.800]  any way that Apple could offer third parties the level of integration between devices that Apple
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:47.120]  Watch enjoys because it's integrated without also opening up a can of worms that would, you know,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.080]  allow Facebook to install stuff that would, you know, observe every website you visit.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.960]  Yeah. On your watch. Yeah.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.720]  But that leads us into Mark Gurman's story this week.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.120]  Oh, what was—I have that open in a tab and haven't read it yet.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:21.440]  So the rumor is that Apple is considering allowing third party apps to be default apps for,
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:29.920]  specifically, I think it just mentions web browsing and mail and music. At least it talks
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:39.520]  about music on the HomePod. But something that people have been talking about forever.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.840]  Yeah. And that's been a complaint, you know, with, I think, Spotify in particular, you know,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:51.600]  that Apple has favored Apple Music by having, you know, there's an entire product called HomePod
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:57.600]  that only works with Apple Music. Yeah. And that is, yeah, that's mentioned specifically
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.200]  is the possibility of running Spotify on the HomePod as the default music app.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.280]  Right. And it seems, you know, it seems like
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.560]  this is, I mean, I don't know, we'll see if they do it or not. But the fact that they're
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:23.600]  considering it, if that is the case, doesn't seem like it's a coincidence that it's coming after,
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.840]  you know, they've been dragged in front of Congress.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:35.120]  Yeah, probably not. Let me, I'll take the devil's advocate side on this. Which is that
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:44.880]  I've long been sympathetic to Apple's perspective on not allowing you to choose a third party
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.040]  app as your default for web browsing or mail or contacts or calendar.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:59.280]  Not as a diehard, that would be a terrible mistake. But as a, all right, let me give you the other
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.840]  side, you know, sort of like the one button versus two button mouse thing, which again goes back to
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.680]  Larry Tesler, who wanted one button mice because the original mice, the original mice at Xerox
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:16.240]  had three buttons and, and five chord keys. I don't even know what that means.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:22.800]  Did you hear the story? Did you read the story? Just let me, just let me put a finger on, on,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:29.200]  on this thing. The, the story, the other story I saw, I think in the John Markoff obituary in
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:37.280]  the Times was that Larry Tesler at, while still at Xerox was against mice completely. He thought
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:43.920]  they were too complicated and wanted to show that, that they were wrong. He thought cursor
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.320]  keys were the way to go. And so he brought people, for word processing in particular,
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.760]  and he brought people in off the street who had never used a computer word processor
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:59.520]  and showed them how to do it using a Xerox system with no mouse installed, just using cursor keys.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:05.200]  And they all took to it very quickly, thought this is great. This is so much better than a typewriter
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.280]  because you can, you know, go back and correct mistakes and you can copy and paste and they got
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.160]  it. They could do, they could, they, typical people learn to do it. And he thought, and now I'm going
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.080]  to teach them, I'm going to show them how to do it with a mouse and they're going to hate it. And I
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.200]  can show everybody that this is the worst. And he plugged the mouse in and showed them how to do it
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.160]  with the mouse. And they all said right away, oh, I don't want to use that. I don't understand it.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.280]  And then he said, well, let me show you how it works. And he showed him how it works. And as
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:39.120]  soon as he showed him how it works, they're like, oh, this is way better. Oh, this is great. And
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:45.680]  he then, this is the part, this is what makes, this is why Larry Tesler is to me a hero and
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.120]  we need more. I mean, we're losing this sort of thinking in this world today. He was like, okay,
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:58.640]  I was wrong, you know, and, which is exactly what you write, but that's what you want. You want,
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:07.120]  you know, the true scientific method is come up with a hypothesis, test it, and then accurately
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.040]  gauge the results of the test. Whereas our modern world has gone to come up with your hypothesis
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:23.600]  and then sell it. Exactly. No matter what the evidence says. No matter what it is. Spend all
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:30.080]  of your mental effort coming up with a way to justify it. Get a few rounds of VC funding and
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:42.160]  sell it. So we were talking about default apps, default apps. All right. Yeah. So,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.480]  my defense about it is, and I would like to see them do it. I mean, just say overall,
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:56.240]  I would like to see them do it. I use Fantastical as my main calendar, although I think on all the
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.400]  other ones, they might do it. Well, I also have Cardhop installed, which is also from Flexibits,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:09.760]  which is an alternative to the contacts app. I guess if I could, I might set Cardhop as my
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.320]  default contacts app, but I definitely would set Fantastical as my default calendar.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.520]  But I use Safari and Mail, but I get it, you know, that it would be nice when you click
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.280]  an email address and you use something like the Gmail app or Spark or, you know, there's a bunch
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.800]  of great third-party email apps for the iPhone. Wouldn't it be great if it opened? And I know
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:40.320]  there's people who use Chrome, but I think Apple's thinking on this is the historical scarring
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:49.040]  of allowing third-party software to be indispensable and then holding them up.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:55.840]  And the best example of this is the influence, the outsized influence that Microsoft Office
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:05.040]  and the Adobe suite had in the transition from classic to classic macOS to macOS 10.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.320]  And Microsoft and Adobe essentially got to dictate an awful lot of what became carbon,
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:20.320]  because basically they were both like, you know, we're not going to this Coco thing all in, you
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:25.200]  know, come up with something that lets us, you know, do a lot less work and keep our code base
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.920]  mostly in shape. And those aren't the only examples, but like, here's my example with
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:41.280]  iOS. Some of Google's apps, it may be a lot of Google's apps on iOS, are to me inexplicably slow
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:47.840]  to update to things like new screen sizes, right? I've had a couple of Google apps that I've used
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.520]  that like when, I forget which years, but like when the iPhone has changed shape, I've had black
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:01.360]  bars at the top and bottom for months after the iOS update shipped or the new iPhone hardware
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.080]  shipped and was in my hand until Google updated the apps to actually update to the new screen
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:15.840]  sizes. And I think Apple is loathe to allow, let's just say, you know, the elephant in the room would
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.680]  be Chrome, right? That there's an awful lot of people who I think would rather use Chrome
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.160]  than Safari as their browser because they're in the Google ecosystem and it syncs their
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:32.640]  Chrome tabs across because they're using Chrome on the Mac. I think Apple's loathe to do that
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.720]  in some ways because they're loathe, like what happens if, you know, they update iOS to have
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.120]  some feature? Maybe it's hardware and it has a new screen size, maybe it's software and there's
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.360]  like a totally new, let's, like a totally new multitasking method for iPad, right?
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.520]  Just as an example.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:59.760]  Just as an example, but if they do, but it would require apps to be updated to support it.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:07.040]  And months and months go by and Chrome isn't updated to support it. And 30% of iPad users
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.160]  are using Chrome. Well, then 30% of iPad users are using a browser that isn't updated for this.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:19.200]  Yeah, you know, that is, I think, a large part of Apple's thinking on this, that it's not,
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:29.040]  you know, they don't make money by people using Safari instead of Chrome or Firefox
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.120]  on iOS, right? They're not selling access.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.120]  Not both, yeah. I mean, not email and not web browsing, right? They do music.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.640]  Right. So music is a much better example, but music isn't a,
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.080]  it's too, there's a conflation here between two different issues. There's default apps,
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080]  which I think only applies to
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:58.240]  utility apps, contacts, calendar, mail, and...
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.800]  Well, there's the question of what Siri uses, right?
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.200]  Right, but that's different than a default app. And I guess that is...
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.840]  Well, sort of, right?
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:16.640]  Well, I think of default apps in a URL context, right? What happens when you click an HTTP link?
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.880]  It's supposed to go to your default web browser. A mail to colon link goes to your mail app.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.720]  A cal, I forget the name of the URL, but it's like cal dot or cal colon something.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.960]  And, you know, you can download a contact in a standard format that opens in your default,
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:46.320]  on your Mac, opens in your default contacts app. I guess in this context of Siri, it's not URLs,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.320]  but it is sort of a, if you say, hey, Dingus, play some Rolling Stones,
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:00.240]  it's the effectively, right now, if Dingus is Siri, it is only going to play Apple Music.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.320]  And I get it, you know, and that's Spotify's complaint before
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.920]  regulators around, well, maybe not around the world, but at least in the US and Europe.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:16.000]  And it's important in certain contexts, right? I mean, if you're driving,
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:22.960]  you want to be able to do that. And if you have contexts that are important enough
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.200]  that you can't futz with it at the time, you are more likely to go with whatever the default is.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.240]  Yeah, but I don't understand how that would work on the HomePod, because at least on the Mac,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:42.720]  you are on iOS, or for the contacts calendar, web, and email, we all know how that will work.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.760]  You would just be able to specify that, effectively, the URL handler for it. And
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:57.680]  somewhere in the settings app, it would say, default apps, and the default, you'd go to email,
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:04.880]  and the list of apps would be all of the apps you've installed, that, you know,
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:09.920]  probably just through metadata into like an info.plist, probably wouldn't even be an API
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.440]  per se, but just, you know, would say, you know, I'm registering with the system as an app that
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:22.080]  can be a default email app. You know, like you do with contact blockers, network content blockers,
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.640]  like when you install a Safari web content blocker, there's a section and preferences
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:32.080]  that you go to, you know, Safari content blockers, and it'll just list all of the content blockers
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.880]  you have installed. Presumably, there would be a list of email clients, and you could tap one of
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.280]  them, and it would change, and then when you ever tap a mail to link, it would open in that app
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:50.320]  instead of mail. With the music, I'm not quite sure how it would work, because there are no apps
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:58.880]  for HomePod, right? Like, at a technical level, I'm not quite sure how in the world you could talk
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:05.200]  to your HomePod and say, hey, Dingus, play the Rolling Stones and have it go through a Spotify
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.080]  account, because there's no apps on the HomePod. And it's weird, right, because the HomePod
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:15.840]  version of Siri is a little bit different, isn't it? Yeah, because a lot of times she will say,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:21.360]  she will say, I can't do that on this device. I forget what I just did the other day,
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:31.200]  and it was weird. Oh, I know what it was. I wanted to do a division problem, and I said,
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:41.040]  you know, what's $500 divided by 12 or whatever it was, and she said she couldn't do it on this
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.880]  device, which I thought was weird, because I know I've done math, and it's because I said dollars,
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.480]  and even though technically that doesn't involve any kind of currency conversion.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:58.640]  Did you see what I mean? So, in a sense, it's a bug, because there was no currency conversion
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.560]  involved, so she should have just been able to do the division, but because I said dollars,
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.760]  it triggered a, this is a currency conversion thing, so it can't be done on a HomePod. You
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.200]  have to do it on an iOS device. It was something like that, but there's definitely things you can't
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.560]  do on HomePod that you can do on other devices. I don't understand how Siri integration would work
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:28.800]  with a HomePod like that, because HomePod isn't like Apple Watch, where it's tethered to an iPhone
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:36.400]  or an iPad to do all the work, right? Yeah. It's not like, oh, you have Spotify on your phone,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.480]  so therefore you could talk to your HomePod and it'll just work, because it'll get it from your
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.400]  phone, because, you know, what happens if you go to work and your spouse wants to?
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:47.760]  Too bad.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.160]  You can't listen to music until John comes home, you know?
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.800]  That would not be considered an upgrade to HomePod.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:04.880]  No. Well, but there's, you know, there has to be, I imagine that these are separate systems,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:12.880]  though, right? I mean, Siri is a separate system from Apple Music, and at some point in Apple's
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.440]  back end, it is parsing out what you're saying to, Siri is parsing out what you're saying to it,
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:29.040]  and then passing certain values to the music server, and then that's what you get, you know,
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:36.160]  when you get what you get in return. So it should be able to pass those values to another provider.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.520]  As my friend Rich Siegel of BB Edit fame, who was recently on the show, and it was a great show,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:45.280]  and I really thank him for it, but he would always, he had this saying when I worked at
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.560]  Barebones, and I would come in and, you know, he just had this saying about programming that,
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:17:00.960]  well, it's all just typing. He's not wrong. You know, and he's not that he was the sort of,
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.680]  not that he ever has been the sort of person to just by default say yes to feature requests,
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.120]  but if it came down to it and it was like the argument was, well, but that would be hard,
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.600]  he would be like, well, it is, it's all just typing, you know? So it is, you know, it's not
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:18.800]  like, you know, there's some sort of technical limit that HomePod couldn't offer some kind of
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:25.600]  integration with, you know, or like a plug-in API and, you know, it would obviously, you know,
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.160]  I guess if Germin is correct, that must be what they're working on, though. They must be working.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.440]  But what was interesting was that he just mentioned it on the HomePod. Did not talk
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.920]  about music on iOS, I don't think. Yeah, and that would be easier, in my opinion,
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.720]  because there you'd already, you know, there's already a concept.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.840]  There's already an app, yeah.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.560]  Right, and the app would just offer Siri, you know, this Spotify app could be updated with
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.840]  a new API to offer, you know, here's the, you know, if you're a music, maybe it would even
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.480]  be specific to music or something, I don't know. I mean, I guess audio would be a better way to
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.840]  think of it so that, because I would think you would want podcast apps to be able to integrate
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:12.240]  just as well so that you can say, you know, hey, Dingus, you know, play the latest episode of
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.160]  the talk show and the right thing would happen even if you use Castro or Overcast instead of
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.360]  Apple's podcast app. So hopefully he's right. I think that would be a great idea, honestly,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:30.960]  and not even, you know, not even as a anti-competition regulatory zealot, you know,
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.560]  it would just be a great feature for users, right? I mean, because it's good that you're
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.960]  allowed to use Castro and Overcast and prefer those as your podcast player, and it's good
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.840]  that you're allowed to use Spotify instead of Apple Music, you know, and they should compete
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:52.800]  on the merits, not on the integration. But I'm not the sort of person who thinks that Apple should
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:19:00.240]  somehow hold back on those integrations until it puts everything on equal footing with third
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.840]  parties. Yeah. And I suspect that, you know, if they, I would think it would probably be more,
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.040]  you know, kind of like the keyboard thing where, you know, you'd get it, but it wouldn't quite
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:18.720]  work as well as the default did. So anyway, hopefully it will. Do you use a third party
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:24.160]  keyboard, that third party keyboard thing? No, I don't. I guess I don't really hear much about
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:31.040]  it anymore. And I know Apple added swiping in iOS 13. Do you use the swiping? No. Yeah, I mean,
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:40.640]  I can't, I'm too old. Me too. I don't find it faster. I tried swiping. I believe I downloaded
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:46.480]  before, you know, before it came to, you know, the default keyboard, I tried it on a, you know,
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.440]  another keyboard and I just never liked it. Yeah. It's not the way, I don't think that way. And I
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.880]  found it extremely clumsy to use. Yeah. Yeah. And, but it's great that it's an option and I
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:03.520]  can see how some people it would, but I really do think of the keyboard as a mini version of a
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:11.760]  keyboard, a physical keyboard. And so I want to peck away. Yeah. Yeah. Do you use an iPad while
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.280]  we're talking keyboards? What's your iPad? Do I use an iPad? Yeah. What iPad do you use?
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:27.520]  I have the 11 inch iPad pro from last year. Well, 2018. Yeah. So I've got that too. Yeah. I,
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:32.880]  I cannot type on it at all. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. You like, you like the split
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.240]  keyboard. I like the split keyboard because you can't get it on and you can't get it on the iPad
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.640]  for some reason. I don't know what the hell happened. I don't know what the hell they're
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.000]  thinking because I can only type on iOS with my thumbs. And when they added the split keyboard
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.200]  to iPad, I was like, now I can type. I, it was like the iPad came out and I I've always
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:59.600]  liked the iPad a lot. I mean a lot. Uh, but I really had trouble typing on it,
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:03.280]  although the earlier ones were small enough where I could kind of stretch my thumbs,
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:11.680]  you know, like the, the, the growth from 9.7 to 11. Um, it stretched it so that my thumbs don't
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.760]  quite reach the middle. It's just big enough to not be able to reach the middle comfortably.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:24.240]  For a couple of years after the iPad mini came out, my eyes were still great enough
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.480]  that it was fine. I loved the iPad mini for a couple of years. I mean, I, I just,
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.840]  the first time I ever met, uh, Tim Cook, uh, was during a hands-on,
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:44.480]  uh, app after one of Apple's keynotes. And it was when I think it was the second generation
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.040]  of the iPad mini came out and maybe it went from like non-retina to retina or something like that.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.160]  I don't know, but it was like Tim Cook recognized me and we had just a brief and, you know,
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.360]  he did this, of course, the question, you know what this question was. So what'd you think?
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.360]  That's a great question. It's absolutely, it is. It's, it's, it's just a, you know, that's all,
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.800]  you know, Steve Jobs used to do the same thing when he went around the hands-on.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:15.440]  If you were deemed worthy of Katie Cotton saying, Steve, this is so-and-so from Time magazine.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.960]  And then he would go up and then he would say, so what'd you think? That's, that's what he'd say,
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:23.520]  which is great. And it, you know, but, uh, and then he'd tell Walt Marsburger to get off
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.320]  his damn table. Get off the damn table. No, he didn't tell him. That's the best part.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.760]  I know. He just sat there and stewed. But I love that story.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.000]  But I loved the iPad mini. I loved it. And you know, the only reason I don't,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.200]  still don't use one is it's just a little too small for my eyes right now. And I liked the,
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:48.640]  I wish there was a pro. I like my pencil. So, you know, I actually love the pencil, but.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.680]  You can use the, well, you can use the first-generation pencil, right? Yeah.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.640]  Yeah. Well.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.920]  Yeah. You don't like that one.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.880]  Yeah. I don't like it.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:59.040]  I know. I know. I don't, I don't. We got, Karen got the base, whatever the, you know,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.880]  she got the iPad, iPad laugh for Christmas and, and a pencil. And she in the, you know,
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.080]  the original pencil and she loves that thing. Oh, it is when you, it's so great. It just.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:15.760]  It's cheap. Oh, it is so cheap. It was 250 bucks at Costco. And then the, you know,
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.600]  the pencil was not 100, but still it was. In some ways it's the most
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:25.520]  unhappily priced product ever. It really is. I mean, going back to like 1978, it is.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.440]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.440]  It's the only time that Apple has made a truly fantastic personal computer that is at
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.520]  what can only be described as a truly low price. Yeah.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:48.080]  Yeah. It is. It's the greatest bargain that Apple has ever offered, maybe ever will. But anyway,
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.720]  one of the things I loved about the mini was the fact that you, I could thumb type on it so great.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.720]  It was like better for thumb typing, or it's probably still is better for thumb typing than
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.640]  the iPhone because they're, it's small enough that it's like no stretching and the keys are
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.880]  big enough that you like never hit the wrong key. You know, it loved it for that. The fact that you
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.800]  can't, and then the split keyboard on the bigger ones was like, Oh, this is great. I love it. I
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.200]  did just a split keyboard and then I could still thumb type and it was, you know, I could do it.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:25.200]  Now I can't split the keyboard. I can't type. I literally type like they say Tolkien did,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:32.160]  which is like one finger. I guess he supposedly used two fingers. That's what I use.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:41.360]  Well, I usually hold it with my left hand or like on my arm and just type with the fingers,
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.280]  whatever fingers I can use on the right hand. So I'll use multiple fingers.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.720]  I type with one index, my right index finger and it's maddening and I just either switch to
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:25:01.440]  a different device or if I'm in an iPad mood, I, it's a digression, but I just bought Jason's son
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.040]  of a bitch, Jason Snell. He talked to you new keyboard. Yeah. Another mechanical,
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:11.200]  another mechanical keyboard, but this one's Bluetooth, which is all the difference in the
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:18.400]  world with an iPad, like using a cable connection to the thing. It just sort of defeats the purpose,
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:23.760]  but I have a new mechanical keyboard that's really pretty nice. And so I just use that,
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.440]  but I either use a hardware keyboard or I just don't type at all on the iPad anymore.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.400]  Yeah, I use, I have, yeah, I have a hardware keyboard, hardware keyboard.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.560]  Oh, I'm trying to think, I'm trying to think selfishly. If somebody from Apple
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:42.880]  wrote me a confidential email and said, you can have one or the other, you can have
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:50.160]  a radically fixed multitasking for iPad. And it will, we'll sync, we'll sync all the man hours,
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:59.360]  we'll sync thousands of man hours into this and do it. Or we'll, we'll put, we'll keep multitasking
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.640]  as it is, but put the split keyboard on the iPad Pro. Yeah. You're, you're Sophie's choice. Yeah.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.840]  And we'll let you pick and we'll never, and I'll be like that guy who didn't vote for Jeter and
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:16.960]  we'll, we'll keep it anonymous. I don't know why. Yeah. I mean, I figured there has to be,
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.560]  I don't know. I sort of assumed there was maybe something with the camera that they thought if
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.040]  you were holding the key, the, the iPad with both hands like that, they would cover the camera up
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.600]  or something. I don't, I don't know. My working theory is that it has something to do with the
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:38.160]  extra keys they added, you know, like, like there's a tab tab now like the, the old, like when they
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.800]  made the keyboard a little bigger, they added extra keys. Like you used to not be able to type
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:48.000]  the tab character, you know, like the phone. And now they did. But I would just say, I don't care
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.240]  what, just when I go to split screen, get rid of those keys. I don't care. Yeah. Just return it
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:58.000]  the way it was. Yeah. Yeah. My theory was, um, that's my theory is that, that they, there was
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.240]  some argument inside where they're like, well, if we, if we keep split screen, we're going to lose
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:08.400]  these extra keys, you know, whereas on the devices where split screen still works, you don't lose
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.440]  keys. I would rather just, I would just say, if you lose the keys, you lose the keys. I don't care.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.080]  Yeah. Just let me tell you. I never used, I never used the split screen keyword. Um,
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.720]  but, uh, but I know it's, it's, there's some people who, who really relied on it like you.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.480]  Yeah. And the guy who does the Johnny Ive parody, he also,
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.000]  I didn't know that was a parody.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.440]  Maybe I've said too much.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.760]  Gonna take a break here and thank our next sponsor. Our good friends at Away. Everyone
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.640]  likes to travel differently. Away offers a range of suitcases made of different materials, such as
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:58.480]  polycarbonate, aluminum, and their newest one, durable nylon in a variety of colors and sizes.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:04.800]  So whoever you are and whatever you need to pack, Away has luggage that will help make your next
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:11.280]  trip more seamless. Features of all of their suitcases, all of their suitcases are designed
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.240]  to last a lifetime with durable exteriors that can withstand even the roughest of baggage handlers.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:23.840]  Every suitcase comes with an interior organization system that includes a built-in compression pad to
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.720]  help you pack more in. I've had this for years. I'm telling you, this is one of the best features
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:36.000]  I put my, put my shirts behind that, put the compression pad in there, cinch them down,
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.200]  keeps the shirts as wrinkle-free as anything I've ever tried to do while traveling.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:45.680]  Absolutely fantastic. Keeps your shirts wrinkle-free and gives you more room
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:53.120]  because it literally is a compression system. Let's you pack more and they include a hidden
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.920]  and removable laundry bag that separates your dirty clothes from your clean clothes when you
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:05.120]  come home. They have four 360-degree spinner wheels that are guaranteed to be the smoothest
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.200]  roll, even through the most hectic of airports and stations. I've had my away suitcase at least
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:17.600]  as long as they've been sponsoring the show. Still looks as good as new. The wheels still
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.400]  feel like brand new. I honestly can't believe it, how good it is. They even include a TSA-approved
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:31.760]  combination lock to keep all your belongings safe. It's really, really just a great, great suitcase.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.840]  Just a great, great suitcase. And they have all these sizes. I really love them.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.320]  They really are designed to last a lifetime. If any part of your suitcase breaks,
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.040]  their standout customer service team will arrange to have it fixed or replaced.
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:49.920]  They have a hundred-day trial on everything they make. Take the product out on the road,
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:56.240]  live with it, travel with it. And up to a hundred days, if you decide it's not for you,
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:02.880]  you can return any non-personalized item for a full refund during that period. No if, ands
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:10.960]  or asterisks about it. They offer free shipping and free returns on any order within the contiguous

[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:42.080]  free trial. My thanks to Away. Also, don't forget, their carry-ons come with a built-in battery pack.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:47.040]  The talking points they give me don't even mention it. Still my favorite feature. Absolutely love it.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:53.280]  Every single seat at the airport suddenly becomes a two USB port charging station, because you've
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:59.600]  got one built into your suitcase. And it pops right out, pops right out, so that if you're
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:05.680]  flying an airline that doesn't want you to have one stowed away and you have to stow your carry-on
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:10.240]  under the belly of the plane, you're no problem. You don't even have to open the suitcase. Really,
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:17.680]  a fantastic product. My thanks to Away. What else? What else next on the agenda? I just,
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.720]  just to interject this briefly, but I'm just looking at this. There's a, did you know there
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.440]  was a command that you can run that will return the startup sound? No. What do you, what is it?
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:41.200]  A pseudo NVRAM startup mute equals percent zero zero. Will you paste this in the show notes? Sure.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:46.960]  And it really plays the startup sound? But what if you have one of the new Macs that
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.240]  doesn't have a startup sound? That's the thing. That's where you want, that's where you play it,
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.880]  put it where you run it. That's what it's for. I thought you meant that you type,
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.880]  I thought you meant that you type this in the terminal and it'll just play it for you right
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:07.440]  now. No, no, no, no, no. It'll, it'll resets the, so that's just the, oh, which makes sense. I
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:12.560]  guess. I mean that, you know, yeah. What is it? Control G is the bell, right? Or,
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.680]  well, I don't remember, but there used to be a way, you know, some kind of control sequence
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.480]  you type just to play a beep. I thought you were saying, Oh, isn't that great? I should've,
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.520]  I should've actually listened once you started getting into the, once you started getting into
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.040]  you, do you know that I've ever mentioned this? Do you know that I really cannot spell
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:41.280]  audibly? Like, you know how, like when you have a little kid and you'll be like, Hey, should he get
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:47.760]  D E S S E R T? Uh, because, you know, maybe, you know, your kid was, had been naughty or
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:54.320]  something like that. I, I, I, I cannot, like when Amy would do that, I would have trouble
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:33:00.080]  following, I have trouble following along. I'm a very visual person. You'd say it out loud and
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.960]  then he'd say, yeah, of course they should. I, well, I was better. I'm, I was, I'm much
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.400]  better with Pig Latin, although I'm not good with Pig Latin either. Uh, I end up, I, I I'll
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.000]  get like two words in and then just start saying real words and she'll be like, what are you doing?
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.440]  Hank has always been better at Pig Latin than me. Hank is like fluent in Pig Latin.
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:22.640]  Oh, I'm terrible. Wait, what, what? No, no. You start telling me something about a command
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:27.200]  line thing and I'm like, law, my dad, you know, you might as well be telling it to my mom, you
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.240]  know, but if you showed it to me, I'd get it instantly. And now that you, now that you mentioned
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.480]  N V Ram, of course, you're, you're talking about a thing. I'm going to turn that on today.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:41.920]  Oh yeah. I'm totally going to do that. Yeah. I think it's a crying goddamn shame that they
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.440]  took the startup. I think so too. Yeah. And then they, and then the,
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.560]  and then the stupid thing is they put them all at the beginning of the Apple TV shows.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.960]  Like, I don't understand that. Like you, you have this iconic sound and you take it off the Mac
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:02.560]  and then you still use it on your TV shows. It's not quite the same sound or else it just
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.840]  sounds different to me, but it's not exactly, it's not exactly the same sound, but it's right.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:14.640]  But in the same way that like, you know, I get it that, uh, uh, it's clearly inspired by, you know,
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.480]  and maybe they, I think that the thinking behind it was, well, let's make it a little bit more
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:23.360]  appropriate for the beginning. You know, there's some kind of psychological semantic difference,
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  you know, in the same way that maybe the, the low Apple logo is a different size too, you know,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.840]  let's make it perfect for the shows. Anyway, I'll put that in the show notes. I promise.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.680]  I will try to remember to put it in the show notes. Let me see if,
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.520]  did you actually paste it into the show notes somewhere? I did. I don't see it.
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:49.520]  Uh, can I edit these? I think so. Yeah. Oh, there's something just showed up.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:35:01.840]  Yep. NVRAM. I'm looking for NVRAM. Oh, there it is. There it is. Ah, I can't wait. This is the
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:09.600]  third tip and trick of this episode of the talk show. This is my first. This is absolutely no.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:13.360]  Can I run it right now? Do you think it'll do well? Do you think it'll take my computer now?
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:20.480]  Well, I wouldn't do it. I wonder.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.960]  I won't do it. I won't do it. Just to be on the safe side. We got enough problems.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.240]  Did you, I don't want to go off on too big of a tangent on it, but I mean,
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.800]  are you updated to Catalina? I am. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was going to say something like,
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.680]  I don't have the problems. You know, people have been complaining about like being asked
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.040]  by the operating system all the time. If you really want to do that and stuff like that,
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.800]  I don't really have that problem. I don't do, I don't consider myself much of a,
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.280]  I mean, I know how to do things, but I don't feel like I'm like a real big power user. I don't
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:05.840]  exercise that, that muscle a lot really. Um, only if I'm like writing about something that I want
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:13.520]  to try out and figure out how it works. So I get the thing most often, the thing that I get is the,
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:19.600]  you know, do you want to let this website access downloads? Which I don't find really that annoying.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.760]  I don't, I actually don't either. And I actually, I actually enjoy that one.
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.800]  I get the point of it too. That's the other thing, you know, I mean, I, I, I, I, a number of times I
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.640]  have accidentally like, you know, where you do that thing where you like control click and you do,
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.000]  and it downloads like an HTML, it downloads the HTML instead of like the file that you,
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.720]  I mean, I've, I've done that, you know, fat fingered it by mistake. And so in those instances,
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.840]  well, I guess if you've already given them permission, it's going to download it anyway,
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.600]  but at least the first time it's not going to, there's so many, you know, there,
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:58.320]  there's so many, um, security problems or that aren't, you know, the, the technical ones are
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.280]  way beyond my can. I even have a degree in computer science and I don't understand the,
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:11.200]  the, the, the true genius level you have to be at to, okay, if you do, if you, I understand like
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:17.600]  a buffer overflow. I understand the idea that if there's some program that accepts input and is
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:27.360]  allocated a fixed amount of memory for the input and takes anything from the input and doesn't
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.720]  check the size and just throws it into memory, that it overwrites the bounce. You know, it's,
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.800]  it's like the analogy of like the cup is a fixed size and you're going to accept any amount of
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.000]  beverage from the thing that you're, you know, the, the, the beverage dispenser,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  it's going to overflow the cup, right? That's exactly what happens with memory.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  I understand why that makes apps crash, but I don't understand. It's just beyond me,
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.640]  the black magic of being able to use that to craft the overflowed memory in such a way
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.680]  that it gets to actually start doing things. Like I understand that layperson's explanation of it,
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.560]  but how you would be so talented at programming and finding these things that you would take
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.520]  advantage of it is just beyond me. But that's how a lot of software technical exploits are.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:25.360]  Yeah. The ones that I think are, it's like I fully understand it and it's like,
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:34.320]  oh, you clever rat bastard are the ones that are just, they're not really technical at all.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:40.080]  They're just exploiting things that the people who made the software never even considered because
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.960]  you think, why would anybody ever do that? And I've told this story on the show before, but about
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:53.120]  two or three years ago, Jonas encountered a bug that has since been fixed in Safari.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:00.080]  But I think it was there since the beginning of time, but somehow he wound up on a website that
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:10.560]  had some kind of like, you have to call us to get, your Mac has been infected with malware,
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:18.720]  and this is why it's slow, call us and we'll fix it. And he thankfully called me for help,
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:27.120]  but his computer really was dreadfully slow, like almost unusably slow. But that dialogue was there
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:40.720]  with the 1-800 number. And what the website was doing was sending a nonstop endless stream of
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:47.840]  four byte files to download. And the four byte files, they all had like the same text,
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.400]  like just like ABCD or something like that. Like they were just, you could open, they were just
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.040]  like four byte text files. They were all identical, but they all had a new name or something, or I
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:01.520]  guess the browser will just start adding numbers if they have the same name. And it was just sending
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:08.800]  them endlessly, an endless stream of them. And Safari was just trying to keep up, but couldn't,
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.560]  that the website could send these files faster than Safari could take them and write them. And so
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:23.440]  it actually did render his Mac too slow to use. And so it's very easy to see how a very rational
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:29.040]  person would think, holy shit, they're right, my computer must be infected. I'll call this number,
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:37.040]  right? But I can totally see how it might never have occurred to the engineers of Safari to not
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:45.440]  try to accept downloads as fast as they can. If you're accepting 10 downloads, why not get them
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:51.040]  as fast as you can? There's so many exploits that are like that. It's not really technical,
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:58.480]  but a lay person can imagine the JavaScript programming behind just repeat forever,
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:07.760]  send the download of a text file. And the text files themselves weren't any kind of virus or
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.680]  anything. They were just four-byte text files, and it was just sending them as fast as they could.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.440]  It was like a denial of service, right? I mean, it's like you just, yeah, you're, yeah.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.640]  Yeah. And the trick is if you could just force quit Safari and then open it back up with,
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.560]  either if you don't already have the setting to reopen existing web pages, there's a keyboard
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.600]  shortcut so that it doesn't reopen the pages that were already open so that that page doesn't open
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:37.600]  and start the thing all over again. But anyway, I filed a radar on it and wrote to a friend who I
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:45.760]  know is on the Safari team and got fixed. But I think now a better, even broader solution is the,
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.960]  do you want to accept downloads from this website in the first place, right? Because you don't even
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  want one unwanted download that you didn't ask for by being tricked into clicking something that
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.640]  you didn't, you just thought it was going to open a new page or something like that or whatever,
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.360]  and it's going to download stuff. I think it's a great, that's a warning I'm happy about.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:14.400]  But when a random app that I haven't used in two hours suddenly pops up a dialogue
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.120]  in front of everything I'm working on that says, do you want to allow whatever this app is to
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:25.360]  access the desktop? I find that very annoying. And I kind of get the thinking, I do get the
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.360]  thinking behind it. And I've complained about this desktop warning. And somebody was like,
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.760]  well, I keep, you know, right now I've got my, I'm doing my wife's and my taxes for 2019. And the
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.720]  files are on the desktop. So I don't want any random app to be able to read the desktop.
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:46.640]  You know, I kind of get it. I do get that people put everything they're working, you know,
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.000]  the desktop is what probably a majority of Mac users use for like, here's the thing I'm working
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.200]  on right now. I'm not going to file it away for until I'm done. And in the meantime, I'm going
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:04.480]  to keep it on the desktop because the desktop is so easy to get to. So I get it. But it's like,
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:12.080]  so many of these apps that I'm getting prompted for are apps that I trust completely and implicitly.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:16.640]  I want to be able to just say, you know, I don't have any apps on my system that I don't trust.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.560]  Or at least, you know, like the Mac way of doing it and Apple doesn't really do things this way
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:29.360]  would be, I would like it if it was as simple as like, if there was a, I'm going to come up
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:34.720]  with the dumb name, there's got to be a better name. But if there was a way to have a inside
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.760]  your applications folder, if there was another folder that was called trusted, and it was,
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:46.880]  you know, a magic folder, and any app you put in applications trusted was just guaranteed,
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.080]  you know, and, you know, and do the thing where apps can't install themselves there. The only
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:58.000]  way to get an app there is to actually drag it using the Finder. And when you drag an app there,
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.480]  have a dialogue come up and say, you know, by moving an application here, you are, you know,
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.080]  you know, trusting it with access to the full contents of your home directory.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.120]  I guess that, yeah, I mean, that would obviously solve your problem. But I mean,
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:16.960]  you also end up with apps that would say, you know, in order to run this app,
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.720]  you must install it in trusted. Well, but I still wish, you know,
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:29.600]  but I wish it were possible. Anyway, what was the, oh, but I get stuff that I keep getting things
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:40.720]  because I do enough AppleScript stuff. I just keep getting so many goddamn warnings about apps to get
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.160]  permission to do like inter-application communication and stuff. And some of them
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.120]  are Apple's own apps. Like, I guess fair is fair, you know, like in the sense that we
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.520]  often complain that, hey, Apple lets their stuff get away, you know, like Xcode is distributed
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:03.840]  through the app store and Xcode obviously has permission to do things that are outside the
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:09.680]  sandbox, you know. So Apple has apps in the app store that aren't limited by the same rules as
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:16.080]  third-party apps in the app store. And in a sense, that's not fair. I totally get that.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:26.240]  And so if Apple's apps are asking for this permission, I guess that's fair, but it just
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:35.600]  seems crazy to me. Well, I can't. You'd think, yeah, you'd think that it would be,
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:45.680]  we've pre-approved certain apps for, and maybe even the stuff in the Mac app store.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.960]  Right. Like if they did that at that level, then you could be,
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.040]  you know, sort of you'd get through a lot of things and you'd be assured that it was
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.760]  done in a way that was, you know, somebody took a look at it.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:03.520]  Well, and then the other thing is that there's just so many things that it's like,
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:07.360]  I don't even remember, they're scattered, you know, the permissions are scattered all over
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.200]  the place in system preferences where there's like full disk access and there's this other
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:21.440]  type of access. And I just want to say, like, so there's an accessibility system prefs pane,
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:28.000]  prefs pane, right? That's a top level of system preferences. But then there's also insecurity
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.040]  and privacy and accessibility item in the left-hand column of privacy that has allowed
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:42.480]  these apps to control your computer. And it's like, isn't that confusing that there's an
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.720]  accessibility pref pane and then there's an accessibility section in the privacy section
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.240]  of security and privacy and it uses the same icon. But that's where I've got things like in
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.600]  there, there's an app called AE server. And I was like, hey, server, I never even heard of that.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.560]  What the hell is that? And I reveal it, you can control click and it says like show and finder
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:08.160]  and you show it and finder. And it's at system library frameworks, core services dot framework,
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.680]  versions, a frameworks, AE dot framework, versions, a support.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.160]  That's- Aren't you glad you asked?
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.800]  But that's, you know, that's like the holiest of holies in the operating system. Anything in system
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:27.280]  library is like ought to be implicitly trusted. And then there's another one here. The icon looks
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:33.040]  like the terminal icon. It's just called launcher with a lowercase L. And it was asking me for
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.520]  permission. I was like, well, that seems like it might be sketchy, you know, and let me do my
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.880]  expert thing here that I want to be able to do, which is I'm going to be the Mac nerd who knows
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:49.120]  how to check if something should be trusted or not. Lowercase L launcher, which wants permission
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:56.800]  to control my computer is at, it's inside the system preferences app. It's system preferences,
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:04.000]  contents, resources. There's an app, a little process called launcher. Well done. Like there's,
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.600]  it's almost like you're, it's like inception at this point where system, something inside system
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:14.160]  preferences is asking for a preference that I can only set inside system preferences.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.400]  You know what I mean? And, and, and Apple has done this thing, you know, in Catalina,
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.600]  which is great where there's at a technical level, your startup disk is now actually two disks,
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.400]  a read only system partition, and then the read write system partition with where your user
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:41.120]  directory and stuff like that is. And therefore, while you're booted in regular non-emergency
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:46.800]  safe mode, whatever you call it, you can't write to that read only system partition,
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:54.960]  which is fantastic. So that like the file system itself is protected against some bugs that Apple
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:49:00.160]  could make, you know, there's no way there's a whole class of bugs that could maybe be exploited
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.800]  that would allow bad guy software to overwrite the system software itself. It's great that it's not
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.000]  even possible that it's blocked at the file system level, but a process that's in that,
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.840]  like this launcher ought to be implicitly trustworthy, right? Like, and how the hell is a
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.320]  normal person supposed to look at a dialogue that says allow this app and the icon looks like the
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:30.720]  terminal app, because it's just like a background daemon and the name is just lowercase L launcher,
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:37.040]  right? How is a normal person supposed to do this? And know that what they really want to do is say,
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:44.160]  yes, I want to give you permission to control my computer. So is that it asked you to do that?
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.720]  Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. I don't have launcher in there. But I have the other one.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:56.400]  I have the a server, a server one. Yeah. And it never it's never asked me. I don't know. I just
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.080]  feel about that. I get it. Like, I'm not saying that we should go back to the old days where
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.000]  anything you install on your Mac and do anything at once. Willy nilly, I get it. Yeah, you know,
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.280]  those days are gone. You know, it was, you know, but I just don't think the stuff should be hidden.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.120]  Yeah, I had a thing. I guess I should bring it up. I'm going to write about it. I didn't quite
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:22.560]  get it done before we recorded. But the location of media files on Mac OS 10.5 Catalina. So I ran
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.760]  into this problem. So you know, like, like, where does iTunes? Well, iTunes doesn't exist anymore.
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.000]  But why? Where did iTunes put your music files? Well, it was in your home folder in a folder
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.720]  called music. Well, that was, that's pretty obvious, right? Like, so if you ever wanted
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:46.160]  to like actually get to your music, you know, there, you could get to it. I had a thing. I'm
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:54.720]  trying to think how I can make this short enough. But I don't use Apple's podcast app. I listen to
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:02.880]  all podcasts that I normally listen to in overcast. And I do all on my iPhone. I don't ever listen to
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:08.960]  podcasts on any device other than my iPhone. That's just the way that that I listen to podcasts.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:16.400]  But I subscribe to my own podcast in Apple podcasts, because I know lots of people use it.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.240]  And I want to just every once in a while, I want to make sure you know, it looks right as does,
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:24.960]  does it you know, does this work the way I think it does in this very popular, very important and
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.720]  you know, it's a very good app. I can see why lots and lots of people like the Apple podcast app.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:36.320]  And I was looking at it this week. I hadn't looked at it on my Catalina Mac, you know,
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:41.920]  really, really since that that breakup between iTunes, you know, iTunes being busted into these
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.480]  separate apps. And I thought, well, I should do that. You know, I've still periodically take a
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:52.320]  look at how it looks on the iPhone. And I looked at it and I was scrolling down and there were four
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:52:00.800]  episodes that didn't appear. It was like episodes like 245 to 248, which is like roughly a year ago.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:07.120]  And they just weren't listed in the all episodes. And so I was like, Hmm, and my first thought was
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.600]  there. I bet there's something wrong with my RSS feed for the podcast. And then before I even
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:16.560]  finished the thought in my head, I was like, No, I'll bet it's the podcast catalyst app.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:24.240]  I was like, I'm not gonna go and debug my my RSS feed for the talk show yet. Let me see.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:30.160]  And I thought, I know what I'll do. I'll unsubscribe from the show in podcasts and delete
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:36.000]  all of the ones that it's already had all through the podcast app. And then I'll quit the podcast
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.280]  app and I'll relaunch it and I'll resubscribe to the talk show. And I did that. And I went to all
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:46.480]  episodes and the same four episodes were missing. And I thought, Hmm, then I went to my phone and
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.560]  looked in Apple's podcast app and I scrolled through all episodes and those episodes are
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:56.800]  right there. They're listed fine. And I went to, you know, Overcast and there they are. They're
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:03.040]  fine. And I thought, It's not my feed. There's something cached locally on my this catalyst
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:12.320]  podcast app. How do I delete all the files? And it's there's they're not in slash home,
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:18.640]  you know, home slash music anymore. Where the heck are they? And I went and I figured out that
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:24.720]  there's a whole bunch of stuff because it's a catalyst app. By default, instead of storing
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:30.160]  stuff in your library folder, it stores it in library slash containers, slash stuff. And you
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.520]  go into the library slash containers and there's all sorts of stuff. But there were four com dot
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:42.320]  Apple dot podcasts directories in there. And I just deleted all four of them, put them in the
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:48.320]  trash, deleted the trash while the app was quit, relaunched the app. And son of a bitch still was
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:55.200]  missing the same four episodes. So I started and it's just really hard to Google for. And then I
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:02.720]  found an article from Kirk Meiklehurn. Again, I hope I'm not, he's a long time Mac writer,
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:08.960]  Kirkville. I think that's at least close to right. And has long been and is, you know,
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:14.640]  literally has written the book. You know, his most recent book that he's written is take control of
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:22.240]  Mac OS media apps. Literally, you know, long time, decade or longer expert on Apple's, you know,
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:31.360]  iTunes and the various media apps. He had an article right after WWDC. Where does Catalina
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:38.720]  store your media files? Well, here's where Catalina's podcast app stores your media files,
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:46.000]  home slash your home folder, meaning slash library slash group containers.
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.800]  So far, so good, I guess slash. Well, not really because library is hidden to most people. Yeah,
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:59.280]  library is hidden. Although I'm okay with that decision to make it invisible, you know,
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.840]  and that you have to go and because it's not too hard to get into it, even though it's invisible,
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:08.640]  because there's like a go to command in the Finder and you can type it and it'll auto complete even.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.600]  So I'm okay. That's a decision a change Apple made that I'm okay with because most people
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:18.240]  shouldn't be. If they don't know what they're doing, you shouldn't be dicking around in your
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:34.240]  library folder. All right, group library slash group containers slash 243lu875e5.groups.com.apple.podcast.
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:44.080]  Now, I don't think I have that. But you do. And I bet it's just sorting in a way. No,
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:51.840]  it's a different number. Oh, is it? Mine? It ends with it ends with groups.com.apple.podcast.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.480]  Well, it's got a different number in the front. Well, mine is exactly the same as Kirk's for
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.000]  some reason. And my thought was, wait, maybe, maybe, no, maybe it's the same. Maybe I'm just
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:11.680]  all right. 243lu875e5. It's the same. It's the same. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. But I saw Kirk's article
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.160]  and I thought, Oh, maybe this is where I should go. So not library slash containers, but library
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:22.880]  slash group containers. And I deleted that folder, and then restarted podcasts. And then I had
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:28.080]  resubscribed to my show and it worked. It was something was cached in there, it had a bad
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.400]  memory of my feed with four episodes missing. You know, and this is this is a decades long trip
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.160]  trick of troubleshooting stuff. Like, if your app is acting up, you want to find out where is it?
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:46.240]  Where might it be storing bad information or a cache, go there, move that file to the trash
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:51.600]  and restart the app and see if that fixes it. Right. This is there. This is like troubleshooting
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.800]  101. Right. I can't believe that there's a single person listening to the show who hasn't
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:04.320]  used that as a basic user level debugging technique. And it worked. It's great. But
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:10.000]  when I first saw the article, I thought, Kirk, that's got to be that has to be some kind of
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.120]  randomized number per user. Right. And then right, lo and behold, it's the same for everybody.
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:23.360]  Why? Like, that's so ugly and gross. And if it's the same, if it's different for everybody,
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:31.280]  I, I still don't there, there would be no security thing, though, because it still matches group.com
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:36.480]  dot apple dot podcast, right? It's not like the whole folder is randomized. But if it's not
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:45.360]  randomized, why is it there? Why? It's so ugly. And part of my Mac nerd superiority complex is
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:50.720]  that everything on the Mac is supposed to be elegant, right? That is the grossest,
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:55.440]  most inelegant thing I've ever seen or imagined. I think I mean, I think the
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:03.440]  lots of things in the library folder are very inelegant. But they used to be it started like
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:09.920]  from the next era, everything was very elegant. And it's like slowly over time, Apple, like
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.840]  internal engineering wise has given up the first level is fine. But then when you get down further
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:21.120]  than that, it turns into a bit of a mess. Right. But I it offends me in the sense of that,
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:29.520]  you know, the back of the cabinet is supposed to look nice way. Right? It offends me that for
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:35.760]  whatever reason, this folder is there. But anyway, I had to delete that and it worked.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:46.320]  They didn't find that. It's not too hidden until you get to that stupid number. Right. But anyway,
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:52.480]  Marco had a tweet Marco Arment had a tweet this week where he was in the finder and
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:58.320]  had a folder full of big, big video files or something, you know, but they actually were
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:02.560]  actually quite large. I think he was like handbraking some video files or something
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.920]  and had done a get info on the parent folder. And the get info window in the finder was showing that
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:16.080]  the folder was 00 bytes. And his screenshot that he tweeted was like the actual finder window with
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:21.200]  file sizes, you know, and it's a whole bunch of like, you know, 100 megabyte video files,
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:26.880]  the selected folder parent folder, and then the get info panel showing zero bytes. And he was like,
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:35.760]  trust me, Catalina, this folder is more than zero bytes. And I pinged him privately about it. And
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:40.720]  he said, like, at some point, he was not quite sure when because he, you know, like took the
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:45.440]  time to take the screenshot and tweeted it. And then eventually, the get info window did show
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:54.000]  the correct number. But that to me is a very emblematic bug of what I think is wrong with
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.320]  today's Apple software and and their mentality. Yeah, where it did catch up eventually, you know,
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:04.880]  but it should it's the same thing. It's sort of well, I don't know if it's it's not I'm saying
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:09.840]  it's exactly the same thing. But it's also, from a user perspective, it's the same thing when you
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:17.840]  empty the trash and the your available disk space doesn't change. Yes, yes, yes, it is exactly the
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:26.720]  same class of bug, where it's like, all right, tenant one of anything related to the file system
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:38.080]  should be the actual bytes written to disk are maintained with the utmost integrity. So rule one,
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:46.080]  don't corrupt data, actually corrupt it, right? Don't you know, whereas corruption could be
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:51.280]  don't overwrite things, don't overwrite it, don't flip a bit don't have a even, you know,
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.680]  just files that could be, you know, ruined with with one zero turning into a one.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.920]  Don't accidentally delete files, you know, don't you know, the actual, you know, any way that the
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:10.560]  actual bytes on disk could go wrong, don't do that. But rule two, and it should actually be like
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:22.160]  rule one, a not even rule two, one a should be whatever you show to the user must be as accurate
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:32.080]  as possible. And the the idea there is, how is the user supposed to know if what is on their
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:38.160]  disk, and I'm using disk to mean the thing, you know, it could be an SSD, SSD, what is it written
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:43.840]  to permanent storage? How are they supposed to know that it's accurate? And the only way they
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:49.360]  can know is what is presented to them in the user interface. And so what's presented to them in the
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:57.440]  user interface should always be as accurate as possible. And in the old days of the Mac,
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:04.960]  I can't remember that ever being wrong. I can't remember there ever being a bug where get info
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:12.160]  would show you the wrong information. And it would and you'll remember this in the old days,
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:20.880]  both a combination of the speed of spinning hard disks and the nature of the HFS and HFS plus file
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:28.720]  formats, you know, if you're an ATP listener, insert your own ding there. Ding Dong, dingaling,
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:35.680]  whatever they play. It was expensive, right? Like if you had a special, you know, the bigger the
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:41.840]  folder and the more items that were in it, it wasn't a very fast thing, nature of the disk
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:47.440]  nature of HFS plus that it wasn't it automatically, you know, automatically computed what a folder
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:55.200]  size was. But it would never show you the wrong number, it would show you a placeholder, it might,
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:00.320]  you know, maybe like in a in a file listing, it would just be a dash wouldn't say zero,
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:06.480]  it would say dash. And if you did get info, it would spin it while it was computing,
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:11.440]  which is exactly accurate, right? What does the spinner mean? The spinner means
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.440]  the computer is figuring it out, I'm figuring it out, which is exactly right. It would be better
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:24.480]  if it gave you the answer instantaneously. But it's still 100% truthful and accurate
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:30.960]  to show an animated spinner, right? It would be bad if that spinner just suddenly stopped,
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:38.480]  right? Because that would say to the me, the user, Oh, God, something's wrong with my desk.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:46.400]  Right? Right? I mean, all of us who grew up in that era, we've probably shortened our lives to
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:52.880]  some extent, like I've taken some amount of longevity out of my heart with actual a
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:04:01.200]  actual disk problems. And imagined suspected disk problems, right? So if I, you know, in the old
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.160]  days, if I opened if I'd selected a folder and did get info, and it started spinning,
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.600]  and then the spinner just locked up, my heart would skip a beat. And then I, you know,
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.360]  I don't recall that actually happening. But that's what would have happened. You know,
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:18.960]  or like I always say, like, remember, if you like when you'd hear like a clicking noise.
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:24.400]  If your heart disk started clicking, that was not good. It was a race against time.
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.000]  It was, you know, Oh, my God, what's the most important file on this disk?
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:34.160]  It was like getting, you know, it was like getting, you know, your, your house is on fire.
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:39.440]  Well, first, get the people out, get the dog out. Yeah. And now you start thinking, what else? What
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:45.520]  else can I get out of the house? What do I take? Right? That's, that's what it was like if your
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:53.520]  hard disk started clicking. I showing zero bytes for a selection is, yeah, even if you eventually
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:59.280]  catch up 30 seconds later and show the right thing is so wrong. It's so fundamentally wrong.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:07.680]  Because it it casts doubt on the integrity of your file system. And that is I yeah, I mean,
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.200]  that's I would rather it's even with the thing where you empty the trash and it's I would rather
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:16.640]  it would say, it would say updating or something, you know, like, it's, it doesn't currently know.
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:21.440]  Right. Although I think maybe they don't do it because it takes too long. And it looks weird if
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:25.440]  it's updating for that. That also looks a little strange if it's updating for an awfully long time.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:31.360]  But it's like it that's what it's much more accurate. It's worse. It's, it's downright
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.520]  wrong to show the wrong number. Yes. And it makes no sense. Like what you're saying. I know what
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.680]  you're talking about. Like you think like you have like a disk, like, you know, like, you know,
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:43.920]  you have like a disk, like, that's like almost out of space. And but there's like a giant thing you
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.920]  can throw out. And you're like, oh, that'll free up enough space, you put it in the trash, empty
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:56.800]  the trash happens. And it's like, what, and you can get different results, different ways. Like,
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:04.480]  if you go to the new thing in the, you know, about this Mac, that shows storage, you know, and it
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:09.920]  shows it like with a graph. And you know, you go to about this Mac storage, and then you hit manage.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:18.080]  And it's like, it can show you different different numbers. Then you get in the finder. Like,
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:24.240]  that's insane. It's absolutely insane. And I just think that it's sort of indicative of a
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:33.040]  that in turn inside Apple, they've sort of lost sense of what should be at an utmost priority.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:40.000]  And I think like accurately reflecting the current state of the file system in the user interface
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:46.240]  should be just a half step behind the importance of the actual integrity of your file system.
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.840]  Because from the user's perspective, how else are they to know? Yes, it would absolutely be worse
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:58.080]  if the actual file system were corrupted. And it you know, Apple, by all accounts,
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:06.480]  the whole transition to APFS has been a glorious success, right? It's, you know, I guess there's
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.240]  some hiccups at the outs, you know, there's some aspects of it that maybe haven't been completely
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:16.640]  perfect. But overall, the millions and 10s of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of devices,
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.520]  maybe Yeah, probably hundreds of millions of devices of Mac and iOS around the globe
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:30.160]  have been updated from the HFS plus file system to the APFS file system without anybody knowing
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:38.080]  and it all just works. And the, you know, APFS is better in a whole slew of ways. And it's really,
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:44.480]  you know, and seems seemingly is, you know, terrific in terms of data integrity. It's a
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.960]  terrific success, which is everything you'd want from an operating system vendor shipping a new file
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:56.480]  system. But their commitment to making sure that everywhere in the user interface that the file
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:08:05.280]  system can be reflected is always up to date or shows that it's in progress of getting up to date
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:11.760]  is is to me, inexcusable. Yeah. And I don't know what the tech I mean, obviously, I don't know what
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:19.600]  the technical reason behind why it takes longer. I don't know either now would be I mean, you'd
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:25.360]  think that, well, I don't know. All right. You're deleting 10 gigabytes. I mean, I know I can see
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:30.320]  how big a file is. Right. You know, and if I delete that file, I can do the math, you know,
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:36.720]  practically in my head. Well, if it's gonna take a while, tell me it's gonna take a while,
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.920]  you know, don't don't, you know, right. All right. On that upbeat note, let's take a third
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.400]  break here and thank our third and final sponsor Squarespace. Oh, I love Squarespace. You guys know
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:51.520]  Squarespace. I'll tell you who doesn't know Squarespace. Siri doesn't know Squarespace.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.640]  The other day I was texting somebody about Squarespace. And when I said Squarespace,
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:02.320]  I was actually using the Siri dictation and it's just spelled it lowercase s space, space.
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:08.400]  It's like, come on, Siri, how do you not know Squarespace? Everybody knows Squarespace. I mean,
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:14.800]  Siri obviously doesn't listen to the talk show because if Siri did, Siri would know Squarespace.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:20.560]  Squarespace is the all in one hosting solution for websites. They've got everything you want,
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:25.680]  need a website. You go to Squarespace and you can do everything from registering domains,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.520]  picking a template to start with in a design, tweaking that template through an award winning
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:39.200]  WYSIWYG interface right in your web browser, analytics so that you can see where people are
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:45.280]  coming to your website and all of the components you might need. Like you want to have a blog on
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:49.840]  your website. They've got it built in. You want to host a podcast on your website. They've got
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:55.840]  it built in. You want to sell things on your website. They have a store built right in any
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.320]  kind of website that you want to build. You can build it with Squarespace and it's almost
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:05.520]  certainly going to be 10 times less work than building it by hand. You can really go a long
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:12.160]  way and you don't even have to use their templates. You can customize the design with your own brand
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:19.760]  down to the pixel. It's just a terrific service. Next time you or anybody you know who comes to you
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:25.600]  for technical help needs a new website, think about Squarespace. I would go there. Here's what
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.400]  you need to remember. If you want to throw them the love from the talk show and their continuing
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:36.880]  support of this show and its sponsorships, send them to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:46.960]  That's talk show squarespace.com slash talk show and use that offer code talk show when you pay,
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.480]  which you don't even have to do for 30 days. You get 30 days free. But when you do start paying,
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:56.800]  remember that code talk show. You get 10% off your first order. You could prepay for a year.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.880]  That's saving over a month right there, right off your first bill. So go to squarespace.com
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:10.880]  slash talk show. Next time you need a website, remember Squarespace. Enough ranting about
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:17.040]  Catalina. What else we got? Let's go speed mode, right? Apple results warning due to
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:24.800]  coronavirus. So Apple last week had to correct their just from January 28th estimate for the
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:32.720]  next quarter for two reasons. Supply chain is messed up in China because of this coronavirus
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:39.520]  and the lockdown within China. So they basically have closed plants in order to not further spread
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:48.000]  the virus, right? Right. And this is somehow in the three weeks since they issued their estimates
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:55.280]  there, they've gotten a much more pessimistic viewpoint on both suppliers. It seems like some
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:02.880]  of it's suppliers as opposed to Apple's own factories at Foxconn, but it's probably a little
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:09.600]  bit of column A, a little bit of column B. And then the other factor is retail demand within
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.040]  China because people aren't going out and stores are closed and including Apple stores. And so
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:23.840]  all of it not good, but I guess it sounds to me like following the news, I know I'm not
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:28.880]  following it as closely as some people, but it seems like it's sort of under control and
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.800]  being conservative about this and taking it seriously seems like the right path,
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:38.480]  but it's not good for a company with a big foothold in China like Apple.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.880]  Well, and it sort of went through a phase where it was like, oh, this seems like a problem,
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.040]  but maybe it's not too big a problem. And then there was a little bit of a floodgate opening
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.320]  where it seemed like, oh, it looks like the Chinese government maybe wasn't telling us all
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:13:01.840]  about every case that happened. And so that prompted some further reaction, and hopefully now
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:09.520]  they have come forward. Yeah, I mean, they're now like, okay, this is the real deal and not
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:15.040]  what we were saying before. Yeah, but it does seem like Apple's warning that iPhones might be
[02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:20.880]  in short supply. Who knows what else will be in short supply? I mean, AirPod Pros
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:28.400]  have been in short supply for months. I mean, they're primarily warning about iPhones, but...
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:35.360]  I need a new phone, Jon. That's all I know. I want people to take care of themselves. I don't
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:40.800]  want anybody going into a factory that's sick. I'm just also saying that I need a new phone.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:48.960]  Apple stiffing store employees. So Apple took a case to the California Supreme Court
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:54.240]  that the... It seems like a pretty simple story where they're either at all or most or some
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:14:00.960]  Apple retail stores in California, they've had a years-long policy of, for security reasons,
[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:07.440]  requiring employees who come in with either bags or Apple devices to have them inspected
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:13.840]  every time they leave. I guess leave? I don't think it was... Yeah, I think it was just...
[02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:17.840]  Yeah, it was just on the way out. Right, on the way out. But that includes like a lunch break.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:23.600]  So like you leave for lunch, you still have to do it. But that you would clock out before you
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.720]  got in line. So in other words, you'd go to leave for lunch, you'd clock out, you're off the clock,
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.280]  and then you would have to wait in a line that could take upwards of 20 minutes at some point.
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:39.840]  Hopefully that 20 minutes is the exception rather than the norm, but that was...
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.040]  Wait, did they actually have a line or did they just make you stand in an area?
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.640]  Well, I guess it was stand in an area. Well, but if you're not in a queue...
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.920]  Stand over here. Someone will be with you shortly.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.080]  Because we don't want any lines.
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.160]  I guess you're right. It would be unfair if it was a line because
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.160]  they should get a little dose of their own medicine.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.280]  That would be funny too. And if it was like, if it was hard to tell who the inspectors were.
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:12.320]  Oh, right, right. Because they're all wearing the same clothes.
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:17.280]  Oh yeah, but I don't have the checkout machine, so you need that guy over there.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.080]  You're going to have to wait over here. Someone will be with you.
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:28.000]  That is the most Mac Apple nerd, insider-y joke I can imagine. It is perfect for this show.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.360]  I can almost imagine it as like an SNL skit and it's an SNL...
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:38.480]  It's an SNL skit that would be funny to about 150 people.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.600]  Exactly, yeah. But this is dumb, right? I mean, this is Apple being stupid.
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:50.720]  It's incredibly stupid. I cannot understand it. I have heard from a couple of readers around
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:58.640]  the country at least that this security policy is not at every Apple store. There are some stores
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.520]  where, you know, people have said, I've been working at an Apple store for a while. I bring
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:05.760]  my phone to work every day and then there is, you know, of course I bring my phone to work every day
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:13.200]  and there is no line. So maybe it's at stores where there have been security problems. I'm not
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:20.640]  quite sure what, you know, and Apple unsurprisingly isn't forthcoming about it, but it apparently is
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:26.480]  not a policy at every Apple store. May or may not even be the policy at most stores, but it's just
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:33.120]  common sense that even if it's just one store, the clocking in and clocking out should happen
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:40.000]  after you get through the goddamn line. It's… That's not cool.
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:46.960]  I understand how it happened, how maybe they got into this, right? Like, I'm sympathetic to,
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:53.360]  okay, this store seems to have had a problem where we suspect employees might be walking
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:59.920]  out with merchandise or something, so we're going to have to inspect bags. Okay, I kind of get that.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:08.720]  And maybe logistically, it's like, well, you know, the clock out thing is over here and we
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:11.200]  can only put that, I mean, maybe there's something in there.
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:16.880]  And you optimistically, the security people optimistically think this will never take
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:25.840]  anybody more than 30 seconds to a minute. And they didn't foresee that like a whole, you know,
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:32.240]  10 employees, 10 or 20 employees at big store, maybe, you know, 20 employees all leave at the
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.240]  same time because their shift ends or maybe more, you know, and therefore there's a line and the
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:46.400]  line can take a while. And you wound up with these employees who should be getting paid spending 15,
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:50.640]  20 minutes in a line not getting paid. I mean, it's obviously enough of a problem that they
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:56.320]  brought a lawsuit. I mean, I know some people, you know, you can complain about some, you know,
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:00.480]  frivolous lawsuits. This doesn't seem like a frivolous lawsuit to me at all. This seems like
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:07.120]  system working. This is a legitimate lawsuit and what a class action suit is for.
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.880]  I understand how they got there. But once this got to the point where it became a lawsuit,
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:17.280]  and there was even a thing where it trickled up, you know, and apparently Tim Cook's first
[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:23.280]  awareness of it was him, and it got entered into evidence, him emailing somebody, is this true?
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:29.440]  I totally understand how, you know, Tim Cook might not, you know, I saw some people saying like,
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:32.720]  that just shows that Tim Cook is, you know, out of touch because he didn't know it was going.
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:39.760]  Tim Cook could not possibly be aware of the intricacies of day to day policy at every single
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:45.520]  Apple store in the world. I mean, that would be insane, right? Like, you cannot be the CEO of
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:49.920]  Apple and be aware of things like that. But once it gets to the point where it does trickle up,
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:57.120]  and it becomes a lawsuit, right, and it does cross his desk. I cannot for the life of me see
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:03.280]  how Apple's leadership cook to the, you know, their legal team at the executive level, how they
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:11.120]  decided to fight this to this California Supreme Court rather than just pay. It just seems so wrong
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:16.480]  on the face of it. And right, I mean, for I mean, what is it? It's like, it's a few million dollars
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:21.600]  or something, isn't it? Well, I forget 10 might be 10s of millions. I think, yeah, I mean, something
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:26.640]  we have, but still, it's not in the range of something that Apple, that's really going to
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:34.160]  impact their bottom line. I guarantee, it's impossible to empirically measure PR value.
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:42.800]  But my spidey sense says that they've already lost way more than 20, 30 million dollars of PR
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:49.440]  value by losing this site and this lawsuit and having, you know, news sites publicize that Apple,
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:57.920]  literally the richest corporation in the world, is making retail employees wait and security lines
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:04.480]  off the clock, you know. And the part that I thought it was so absurd is that it left,
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:10.800]  fighting this, left Apple's own lawyers arguing that it's a, you know, you don't have to bring
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:18.560]  your iPhone to work. Right? And like somebody else pointed out to me, like, what about Apple Watch?
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:26.880]  Right? Like, presumably, you know, you would think Apple would say that, you know, that the type of
[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:30.560]  people who they want working in their stores are the type of people who they would like to
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:36.800]  own an Apple Watch, right? And I've observed it myself. It seems to me like just about everybody
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:41.680]  who works at Apple Store wears an Apple Watch. I don't know if that does, is outside the inspection
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:46.000]  thing or whatever, but it's like the phone, though. Who doesn't go to work with their phone?
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:53.920]  I mean, it's insane. That's an absolutely, on its face, an absurd argument for Apple of all
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:59.920]  companies to be arguing. You know, like, if 7-Eleven wanted to argue that its employees
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.040]  don't need to bring their cell phones to work, it's still a BS argument. But 7-Eleven isn't
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:06.800]  selling iPhones.
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.920]  Selling the actual thing.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:14.720]  Yeah. It's just a ridiculous argument.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.920]  Yeah, no, it doesn't hold water.
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:22.400]  Or the argument that, you know, I don't know of a single woman who doesn't take a purse with her
[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:29.280]  to work. I mean, it's, you know, and plenty of men bring bags to work. You know, there's all sorts
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:35.520]  of, you know, it's just ridiculous to say that it's some kind of ridiculous, you know, it's a
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:42.400]  privilege to be able to bring a bag with you to work. Well, I mean, this is nuts. I mean, that's
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:46.800]  like, you know, maybe it's a privilege to be able to bring a bag with you to work if you're working
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:49.200]  in a prison camp making license plates, but...
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:49.760]  Yeah.
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:57.280]  Yeah. I don't know. I thought that was a very strange story. And I just don't understand that.
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:02.400]  I mean, you know, it wasn't like it got lost in some small court. I mean, this is the California
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:09.600]  State Supreme Court, Apple's home state. I mean, it seems very odd to me that they decided to
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:10.080]  fight this.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:14.720]  Yeah. I mean, there must be some...
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:19.680]  More to it than words. There's something we're missing.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:24.000]  Yeah. Like there's some precedent that they're worried about. I don't know. I mean,
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.320]  maybe there's another aspect to it that we, you know, consider. But on the face of it,
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.720]  it certainly seems extremely stupid.
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:38.400]  Yeah. And I have to say that one of the privileges of me having the platform that I have is if I'll
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:42.720]  say something, if I'll post something that says, this is stupid, I don't see any, this is no
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:47.200]  possible explanation for this. And there is, but I didn't see it. Usually there's at least,
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:53.200]  you know, somebody will tweet or email me with the, yeah, well, but... And I'm like,
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:59.280]  oh, okay. You know, I haven't seen one person propose a good reason for Apple to fight this.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:07.680]  It's just a minuscule amount of money for them. You know, and if their retail stores were eking
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:13.200]  out, you know, 3% margins, I guess I could kind of see it. And I realized that there are a ton
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:18.720]  of retail businesses that that's true for, right? Like how everybody knows that like restaurants,
[02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.280]  it's a really hard business. Everybody knows that a new restaurant opens up and you fall in love
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:28.000]  with it and then it closes. It happens all the time because it's a hard business. It's really,
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:35.760]  really hard. I brought this steak to work. This is my steak. Apple's retail stores are literally
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:42.000]  the most profitable per square foot of any store in the world. They could afford to pay people to
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:50.560]  wait in a line that they're making them wait in line for. Oh, man. All right. Last but not least
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:24:01.680]  on my list of topics is Apple TV. You use Apple TV, right? I do. Yeah. Do you mean just use the
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:08.640]  Apple TV app or watch the shows? Apple TV Plus. Well, both, but, you know, you use the device,
[02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:13.760]  right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The physical device. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, they added
[02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:21.920]  multiple users with the TV OS 13. Yeah. And I've set that up, but I don't think anybody's been
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:32.880]  using it. It's terrible. And somehow while I was gone on a trip, we have family sharing and family
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:39.120]  sharing works great. Family sharing is one of the triumphs of Apple services business in my
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:46.800]  experience, where for my family, you know, with three people, everything, all of our media sharing
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:53.360]  just works. And anything I've ever purchased on iTunes, Amy and Jonas are able to play it without
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:59.040]  hiccup whenever they want. It's all been great. It's exactly what you want. It feels very fair.
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:09.760]  But this multiple user thing, so what happened was I was out for a weekend or day, I don't know,
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:13.840]  business trip, I don't know where, but Amy and Jonas wanted to watch a movie. And so they
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:19.200]  entered Jonas's account as an extra account so they could buy the movie because they didn't have,
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:24.880]  I don't know, I don't know why they did it. They should have just called me and had me buy the
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.200]  movie on my phone or something. But they didn't. They added Jonas as a user. And now we have two
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:36.160]  users on the Apple TV, me and Jonas. And I'm the one who watches the most stuff on it. Like Jonas
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:44.560]  watches almost everything on his laptop on his own. And Amy watches mostly stuff on TiVo. And
[02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:51.440]  when she does watch Apple TV, it's with me. And so she doesn't really have a reason to do it.
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:26:00.560]  But I watch stuff. And I'm enjoying the Star Trek Picard show on the CBS All Access.
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:02.080]  As am I.
[02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.240]  All right. That's what I wanted to know. I want to get to that. But part of it is,
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.640]  it's not like Netflix. It's like most things where the episodes come out once a week.
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:20.480]  And what I would like to do when a new episode comes out is I'd like to go and go to the TV app
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:26.080]  and it'll say Picard. I see it. And I go there and tap it. And it'll know what the next episode
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:32.080]  I have to watch is. And two weeks in a row now, it's gone back to episode two of the season.
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:37.120]  And I'm like, what the hell is going on? And then I figured it out. It's because I go to settings,
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:44.160]  multiple users, and Apple TV keeps going back to Jonas instead of me. And I said,
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:47.440]  have you switched this? And he's like, no, I haven't even touched the Apple TV in weeks.
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:52.720]  You know, other than to like sit and watch like a show, all three of us together. Like,
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:58.960]  so the Apple TV is somehow switching back to Jonas instead of me, without me doing it. And
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:08.560]  the insidious part about it is that the interface doesn't show you who's who. Like, Netflix has this
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:14.720]  licked where like, I don't know what the timeout period is, but like after some reasonable timeout
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:19.680]  period, and whatever it is, they've got it right. Because it never seems annoying. Like, hey, I just
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:24.320]  told you it was me, you know, I come back to it. It's like, it's still me. It's like, I don't know,
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.360]  after X amount of time, you fire up Netflix, and it says, who's watching? And there's me,
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:35.360]  Amy and Jonas. And I say, it's me. And then it lets me pick up shows right where I left off,
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.760]  or Amy or Jonas. It asks you that right at the beginning. Right. And Disney Plus,
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:46.960]  which is a brand new app, does the same thing. And it seemingly works just as well. It's Disney Plus,
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:53.920]  you know, we opened it up when I first signed up for Disney Plus. I told it about Amy and Jonas,
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:28:00.640]  and they're there. And we've got, you know, fun, you know, a big advantage Disney Plus has over
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:06.880]  Netflix or anybody is you get, you know, you get the whole Disney library of avatars to choose from.
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:12.560]  Yeah, Netflix, Netflix has really got to get their act together on that. They've really,
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.800]  yeah, their selection is, it's not good. That was good. But at least, you know, it just says,
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:23.360]  like, who are you? And you say who I am, and you have one tap, and then you're in. And then it
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:29.760]  shows you this stuff, like the Apple TV multiple users thing, A, should not be going back to
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:35.440]  another user without having specified it. And B, it doesn't show you who's who, right? So it's like,
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:40.160]  I find that I wonder, does it does it save? I mean, I wonder if you can, like,
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:46.720]  just as a clutch fake that fake it by putting one on light mode and one on dark mode.
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:51.600]  I don't know if that stuff is stored that way. I don't think it is system level.
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:57.680]  I'll try that. But I don't think it is. And I have my Apple TV set up to do light mode in the
[02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:03.520]  daytime and dark mode. Yeah. I don't want to mess with that. But anyway, I figured something out
[02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:07.440]  last night while being frustrated, because last night was when I caught up on the latest episode
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:12.880]  of Star Trek Picard. I didn't know this. I don't know when they added it. I presume it was actually
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:19.040]  with TVS 13, along with the multi user thing. If you hold down the home button on the on this,
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.800]  the Apple TV remote, that's the button that looks like a TV set. I think it's called the home
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:30.880]  button. I actually don't even know. But it's next to the menu button. If you hold that button down,
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:37.680]  it actually slides this thing over from the right that looks like what's this thing called on the
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:44.480]  Mac, the notification center thing? Yeah, it just slides over from the right. And it shows with
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:53.040]  icons, the users who have been set up. And so I thought in select there, yeah, you can select
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:59.280]  there. So it'll, it both highlights who the current user is, and lets you change. And so
[02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:04.800]  you don't I thought up until last night, I thought the only way to change users was to go settings,
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:14.400]  system, users, and then pick a user by email address. But I think hiding it behind I'm number
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:20.240]  one, if I didn't know it, I mean, boy, that's a problem, right? Because I watch almost all my
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:29.360]  non-sports TV on Apple TV. And B, I'm John Gruber. I'm a professional, like, critic of user interfaces
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:36.960]  and user of Apple software. You know, like, it is a, it is in my, I hope that doesn't sound
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:44.640]  self-serving. But that's a problem if it took me until the end of February of an OS that's been out
[02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:51.520]  for five months to figure out that you can do that. Anyway, I'm trying to like it. Yeah. Okay.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:55.600]  So I just brought up Netflix on this iPad I have here. And yeah, because because it seems like that,
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:02.560]  like a like a device, like an iPad or an iPhone, you don't need it as much. And in a way,
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:09.680]  those devices would make more sense for you to because because they're less likely to be handed
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:15.120]  around. Whereas on the Apple TV, if anything, you want it much more in your face, because it's a
[02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:19.440]  thing that's attached to a big TV that's sitting in your living room. And you want to be able to
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:26.880]  know whose account you're in. Yeah. Do you have a Nintendo Switch? Yes. I thought so. So have you,
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:34.400]  do you use it? Yeah, well, I use it to play games. I mean, I've not. Yeah. Well, the Switch has a
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:42.080]  terrific interface for who the current user is. It always shows the users up in the top left. And it
[02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:48.800]  very clearly badges who the current one is. And it, it's, it's such a great interface. Like I,
[02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:54.960]  you know, I don't know if I'll ever get to it. But I feel like I could do just a, I feel like it.
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:32:00.640]  And if somebody else has written it, I would love to link to it. But this feeling I wish it had was
[02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:07.200]  that was a passcode for each account, which it doesn't. Yeah. So Hank is forever getting into my
[02:32:09.680 --> 02:32:16.480]  Breath of the Wild games and screwing them up. You used all my arrows. That's, see, that's a,
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:22.800]  that's less of a security problem and more of a parental problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which I have.
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:28.000]  Right. Like, like you don't need to lock it down for security reasons. You need to lock it down
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:35.360]  because your son's a bit of a jerk. Mm hmm. Exactly. It's a wonderful user interface.
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:39.440]  And it's it, I would have told you if you had told me before I had used it,
[02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:46.480]  that they were going to do a single user interface, not two different presentation modes,
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:53.040]  but it effectively the exact same visual interface, both for a TV where you interact
[02:32:53.040 --> 02:33:03.840]  in a up, down, left, right D-pad and select button method with a controller and as a handheld
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:08.400]  touch screen that you can tap, I would have said, I don't think you can square that circle.
[02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:16.960]  Yeah. You know, the, the, the things that make for a good TV size screen, TV sitting distance,
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:23.120]  D-pad and button interface are, I mean, just think about the differences between
[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:30.000]  the iPad interface to watching a show and the Apple TV interface to watching a show.
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:36.720]  They're two totally different interfaces. Yeah. I would have said you, I would have thought off
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:41.280]  the top of my head, you can't really square that circle. Nintendo has done it where either way,
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:48.240]  either way, it doesn't feel like a compromise. The TV one doesn't feel like you're using a tablet
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:54.720]  on a TV, but somehow stuck with a D-pad. And when you're actually looking at it on the handheld,
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:34:01.040]  it doesn't feel like you're using this giant TV sized interface squished onto the screen.
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:07.440]  It's a remarkable accomplishment of user interface design that I, to my knowledge,
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:11.680]  maybe I'm just not enough, I don't read enough Nintendo sites or something, hasn't been heralded
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:19.920]  enough as a triumph of, of design and user experience. But boy, I wish Apple TV were
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:30.160]  a lot more, TV OS, I wish was a lot more like Switch OS in terms of clarity of who you are,
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:36.960]  where you are, it's TV. It's amazing how they got the Switch so right after the Wii U.
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:40.000]  Yes, totally. Really kind of a mess.
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:46.480]  Yeah, both ways. Like the Wii U was sort of like the opposite where it was bad on the TV
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.280]  and really bad on the touchscreen. Right.
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:56.240]  And it just, it seems to me like Nintendo internally had a full reckoning and said,
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:02.480]  okay, let's literally go back to the drawing board and start all over and come up with something.
[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:09.920]  But I would love a TV version of TV OS that drew, that took notes from everything that
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.160]  Nintendo got right with what I'm calling Switch OS. I don't know what the hell they call their
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:21.520]  operating system, but the Switch OS offers so much clarity and I just, in particular for me,
[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:24.560]  you know, and I think it makes sense for anything you have hooked up to your TV,
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:30.880]  you want to have multi users. The way that the Switch lets you switch users and shows you who
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:39.840]  is the user. I can't imagine how it's both clear who's who and who's current and very obvious how
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:46.000]  to switch. Yeah, and it's right. That's the thing I was going to say. Because even compared to other
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.800]  gaming systems, I think it's much better. Because I don't, I struggle. I don't use the devices as
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:57.440]  much maybe. So maybe that's part of the problem. But I don't, I think just sitting down and trying
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:06.480]  to figure it out compared to the PS4 or the Xbox One is just like, I mean, it's night and day.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:11.520]  It's very obvious on the Switch how to do it. And it's way less obvious on those other platforms.
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:17.520]  PS4 I haven't used in a while. We used to, for a while we had it hooked up to our main TV,
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:22.560]  because it was our DVD player. And Jonas played games on it. I didn't really play games for the
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:31.600]  most part. But I would watch DVDs. But whenever I had to do something, I would be like, you know,
[02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:38.800]  I would always think to myself, you know, it really does look pretty. Like it did. The PS4
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:45.360]  interface to me does have that look of like, this looks like the type of OS that like production
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:55.200]  designers for a movie would design for the fake interface, you know, or like the, you know,
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:59.760]  there's some cool, I always, I'm a nerd for that stuff. I love looking at the user interfaces in
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:06.160]  Westworld. And thank God Amy doesn't watch Westworld because I often pause. She doesn't
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:11.040]  like sci-fi stuff, so she doesn't watch it. But it would honestly, I'd be divorced at this point,
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.960]  because with Westworld, I will pause the show and like get up close to the TV to look at the
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:22.800]  tablets, you know. And I've been doing that with Picard too. I'm like, oh man, that looks cool.
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.600]  Oh man. Anyway, we've gone on a long time. I'm really liking the Picard show.
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.400]  Yeah. And I really, I've heard a lot of people complain about the pace of it,
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:42.720]  but I kind of like it. It's a little slow. It's like you'd think that we would be someplace
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:49.280]  now where we'd be, I don't know, ramping up to something. And it still seems like they're
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:55.840]  putting the team together. I, my favorite episode so far was the second to last.
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.920]  And I knew it, I knew it when I saw that the written by credit was Michael Chabon,
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:08.800]  who I've been a fan of his novels. And I was so excited that he was part of the
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:14.800]  team, you know, executive producers and the writing team. But the episode that he wrote,
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:24.640]  the second to last one was so good. That was, it was the one where he takes upon himself,
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:28.800]  I don't want to spoil it, but he takes upon himself the, you know, his traveling partner
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:35.280]  from the Romulan outpost. Oh man, what a good show. What a good episode that was.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:41.280]  But I'm really enjoying the whole show. And I have to admit, I have skipped, I was a die-hard
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:46.160]  Star Trek The Next Generation fan. Absolutely. It was one of my all-time favorite shows in my
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:53.520]  lifetime. Never missed an episode. And then in the intervening years, I'd start every episode,
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:39:00.000]  or every series, and always petered out. I never got into Deep Space Nine. That's the one I gave
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:07.600]  the biggest try to. Yeah, and yeah, you should check out one of those things where they say,
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:13.040]  just watch these episodes. Get a primer. Because there are some, particularly Deep Space Nine,
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:20.320]  I think, and the tail end of Deep Space Nine is terrific. Voyager doesn't have as great of an arc
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:26.960]  as Deep Space Nine develops. But it's got some good. Yeah, and then I totally skipped the Scott
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:33.600]  Bakula one. Yeah, that one you can pretty much totally skip. There's some good episodes like
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:40.960]  in the last season, but it's kind of rough going to get there. Anyway, I'm really liking Picard.
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:46.800]  For those of you out here who were Star Trek The Next Generation fans, I think it's worth watching.
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:57.040]  It is a totally different type of show. But it does pay credit to the whole thing. It uses a
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:04.720]  lot of elements from various shows, and if you're a fan of those shows, it's so great just to have
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:16.320]  it back on TV. I like Discovery, but it's not the same. Yeah, I didn't watch it. I think it's fun.
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:22.080]  There's things I like about it, but it doesn't feel anywhere close to what I liked about Star
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:28.000]  Trek. I think it's a decent science fiction show, but it doesn't feel like a really good Star Trek
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:33.440]  show. And this feels like a Star Trek show to me. It feels like a really good Star Trek show,
[02:40:33.440 --> 02:40:41.200]  and it's a really good step to the—so The Next Generation was the traditional, this is drama,
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:48.800]  and every episode is a self-contained story. And it wasn't necessarily that they didn't go in order,
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:53.920]  but you could more or less tune in. I mean, they had some small arcs in there,
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:58.800]  but then they definitely had some double-parters. Right, definitely had double-parters,
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:04.320]  but for the most part, they were all standalone little mini-stories. It was like an anthology,
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:13.280]  whereas this is more like the new mega movie. The whole series is like a giant 10-hour movie or a
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:19.600]  20-hour movie over two years or something like that. And it's made the shift in a way that to
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:25.920]  me feels very natural. Really good. I really like it so far. Anyway.
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:31.360]  And he's always a pleasure to watch. Yeah, I would watch him.
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:38.160]  Like, man, I'd watch anything with— Yeah. Even like, they can't be stuff
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:40.720]  in the most recent episode. I really enjoyed it. I just thought it was funny.
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.160]  Yeah. Just seeing him go nuts. Anything with Patrick Stewart. Yeah.
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:49.520]  Yeah, and that felt like a throwback to some of the, you know, it was a totally Next Generation
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:51.200]  type thing, you know? Yeah.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:54.800]  Like a holodeck episode from The Next Generation. Right, yeah.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:01.680]  Yeah. Anyway, thank you, John. I appreciate it. I really appreciate it. Doubly so because of
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:07.680]  the pre-show delays. I'll even apologize on behalf of my mom,
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:11.840]  who's a delightful woman who you would enjoy tremendously.
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:16.640]  Well, I hope she has no more technical problems this weekend.
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.720]  Let's plug some podcasts that you're on on a regular basis.
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:26.400]  I am on The Rebound, where we talk about many of the same things that we talk about on this
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:34.640]  podcast, and Biff, where we talk about superhero shows and movies, and turning this car around,
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:37.440]  where we talk about what a pain my kid is sometimes.
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:42.640]  How he uses up all your arrows. How he uses up my arrows.
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:46.400]  All right, let me thank our sponsors. Our sponsors, Squarespace, that's where you go
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:54.880]  to build a website. Away, that's where you go to buy a new suitcase. And Collide, where you go to
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:43:00.640]  manage your fleet of Apple devices, or Windows and Linux, too, for your growing company. So,
