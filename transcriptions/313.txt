[00:00.000 --> 00:25.360]  Well, you know what impresses me about it is the self-awareness, whereas when I was
[00:25.360 --> 00:34.960]  14, I'm impressed by my own son's self-awareness, too. It is to me a very tangible way that
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.560]  generationally we're improving, and I think we've always been improved like that. Just
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.600]  to go back 100 years to when my grandfather went into the coal mines after 8th grade,
[00:44.600 --> 00:49.120]  I don't think he was that self-aware about it. I don't think he was like, oh, woe is me.
[00:49.120 --> 00:52.240]  It's like, oh, that's what you do. I never hesitate to bring it up because I know my
[00:52.240 --> 00:55.840]  grandfather. Nothing would please him more to know that I consider hard work sitting
[00:55.840 --> 01:01.120]  in a chair in the basement. It is. It's amazing how complicated the world is. Well, anyway,
[01:01.120 --> 01:08.220]  we're here to simplify it for everybody. We've got a lot to talk about. There was the Apple
[01:08.220 --> 01:12.840]  event last week, so I feel like that's a good framework for this. I've got more I want to
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.520]  talk to you about. I just did it last week when I wrote about it. I did it in the order
[01:18.520 --> 01:24.440]  Apple announced this stuff. Sometimes I don't know what to do if I'm doing my thoughts and
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.960]  observation type posts. Should I put them in the order like, hey, what do people most
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.400]  want to hear about? What's most important? And should I just do them in Apple's order?
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.400]  And I get it.
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.760]  So many things, too. This was like, here's a whole crapshoot of stuff that are only a
[01:38.760 --> 01:41.400]  few of which are related, and a lot of them are very interesting.
[01:41.400 --> 01:47.040]  Right. And Apple's stuff, it's not even like spin per se. It's not like, oh, don't do it
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.520]  Apple's way because you don't want to let them dictate it. It's, you know, it's for
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.740]  showmanship. And they had like a whole bunch of stuff. I mean, like, seriously, like three
[01:53.740 --> 01:58.440]  products in the first three minutes. It was like, I mean, the purple iPhone, what are
[01:58.440 --> 02:03.240]  you gonna say? It's purple. I mean, it is nice. They sent me one to look at. It's very
[02:03.240 --> 02:11.360]  nice purple. I mean, they're so good with color. I mean, it really is just a very, very
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.200]  nice shade of purple that I personally would never buy. But, you know, what are you gonna
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.200]  say? I don't blame them.
[02:18.200 --> 02:21.280]  No, it's gorgeous. It's gorgeous. No, I think it's great. I mean, this was the color event,
[02:21.280 --> 02:24.440]  right? They're like, hey, it's okay to have some colors because we've just had a really
[02:24.440 --> 02:31.160]  boring year. So what if we let you buy some things that are not just a few limited shades
[02:31.160 --> 02:32.280]  of gray and white?
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.920]  So I, off the record, got to talk to some people at Apple after the event. And that
[02:37.920 --> 02:44.240]  came up and it was, they sort of demurred on whether the colors, you know, and like
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.480]  the IMAX and the bright color. I got the impression that that was actually in the works before.
[02:49.480 --> 02:53.160]  And I just, you know, typical Apple, they don't want to say, but they completely agreed
[02:53.160 --> 02:57.480]  that it's serendipitous. That's the thing is that they wouldn't say, they never want
[02:57.480 --> 03:02.240]  to say when they make decisions. It's like, of all the things they're secret about, their
[03:02.240 --> 03:08.120]  timelines for product decisions is like the holiest of holies. But, uh,
[03:08.120 --> 03:10.560]  That's right. Yeah. Okay. That's interesting. Yeah. Cause they would have been testing,
[03:10.560 --> 03:15.200]  I mean, they're always testing materials, we know. So to make, to be able to mass produce
[03:15.200 --> 03:20.400]  these colors with these intensities and consistency on the material choices and blah, blah, blah.
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.040]  They've been testing it for three years or five years and they got to a point where they
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.120]  felt they could actually deploy it. But right. I mean, and they have to build the, you know,
[03:27.120 --> 03:30.360]  the painting machines and everything, the anodizing machines, everything they do.
[03:30.360 --> 03:39.440]  Yeah. And they've also clearly got like, uh, I don't know if it's in Alan Dye's team somewhere,
[03:39.440 --> 03:47.080]  but there's, there's some team of tastemakers at Apple who are clearly like totally wired
[03:47.080 --> 03:54.440]  into the worldwide sense of what colors are hot. Oh, interesting. Right. You know, and
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.240]  it's that purple, right? That purple is a, is a hot color. It is. It's not, it's not
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.920]  glaring. It is a very big color this year. And yeah. And they're so good at that. And
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.160]  then the other, the other companies just follow. Like I know that there's a hundred different
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.400]  things that Samsung copies from the iPhone with their phones, but like they're the colors
[04:13.400 --> 04:18.380]  for their devices. It's like preposterous. Like, like remember when Apple, the big thing
[04:18.380 --> 04:22.240]  was the Rose gold, you know, and Rose gold everywhere. And then like everything from
[04:22.240 --> 04:28.680]  Samsung came out Rose gold, but not, not beforehand. It was anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.280]  Apple iPhone. All right. Well, I found podcast subscriptions. This hits closer to home for
[04:34.280 --> 04:40.520]  me at least because you know, I do a podcast. I actually do a podcast that is subscription
[04:40.520 --> 04:49.320]  paid based. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. What'd you think about it? Well, you know, it it's
[04:49.320 --> 04:54.000]  tricky. I mean, Patreon exists was what somebody said when this came out. And I think a podcasting
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.200]  now is more business models than it used to. So it's easier to, it's easier to get money
[05:00.200 --> 05:03.520]  from people who want to give you money to support what you're doing and, and, or to
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.480]  get, you know, extras like additional episodes or special events or whatever. And I think,
[05:08.480 --> 05:11.720]  you know, Jason's knowledge wrote a very thoughtful thing about it. I kind of defer to him on
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.560]  that cause he's been, you know, he's part of and is running a subscription things for
[05:16.560 --> 05:23.640]  a lot of different networks or multiple networks. And I think there's this podcasts are now
[05:23.640 --> 05:31.000]  multimedia, multi-format, multi-place things. So if you're a supporter of somebody's thing,
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.600]  a podcast may be the center of it, but then there may be all kinds of other stuff. There
[05:34.600 --> 05:41.160]  might be videos, downloads, live events, a discord, merchandise, physical and digital.
[05:41.160 --> 05:48.800]  So it's a whole, I think, successful podcasters or successful entrepreneurs of their brand
[05:48.800 --> 05:53.800]  may still have the podcast at the center, but that's not what provides them the most
[05:53.800 --> 05:57.520]  value in the sense of why people become members because they can listen to the podcast often
[05:57.520 --> 06:04.120]  for free or get most of the podcasts for free. So that, you know, Apple's, I think what Apple
[06:04.120 --> 06:08.360]  has done is they've unlocked a really easy way for people who have not yet investigated
[06:08.360 --> 06:15.400]  it or haven't built a big enough audience to dive into Patreon or into one of the other,
[06:15.400 --> 06:20.440]  you know, kind of roll your system kind of things. Like Ben Thompson does, or, you know,
[06:20.440 --> 06:23.520]  there's lots of networks you could join or not networks, but I'm like, you know, Libsyn
[06:23.520 --> 06:25.800]  and all these different hosting systems.
[06:25.800 --> 06:29.480]  Memberful is a big one too, that a lot of people in our sphere use.
[06:29.480 --> 06:32.880]  Yeah. And it's great, right? So there's all these different things you could be part of
[06:32.880 --> 06:36.840]  or do it. So if you haven't done that yet, this is probably huge. And there's probably,
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.440]  you know, 200,000 podcasts where they might go, oh, maybe I should enable this and occasionally
[06:41.440 --> 06:46.360]  record an extra episode and maybe it'll bring in, you know, 50 or $100 a month. I just wonder
[06:46.360 --> 06:53.240]  if it's useful to people who have a big audience. You know, this is kind of the, it's the question
[06:53.240 --> 06:58.280]  about like a Substack. Substack was kind of, you know, oh, it's a newsletter service. Then
[06:58.280 --> 07:01.360]  it was like, oh, there's kind of a getting a lot of big names. It was like, oh, now they're
[07:01.360 --> 07:04.920]  paying advances to people and doing these deals and they raised a bunch of money and
[07:04.920 --> 07:08.520]  suddenly newsletters are super hot and everybody wants in on it, even if the market is only
[07:08.520 --> 07:11.920]  going to be, I don't know, a few billion dollars a year. And there's, I don't know what the
[07:11.920 --> 07:16.720]  upside is for it, but so podcasts is an existing market. The advertising side is actually relatively
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.800]  small. It's growing very quickly still, but it's only in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
[07:20.800 --> 07:25.080]  And I think the big market there is for all the stuff, you know, especially like when
[07:25.080 --> 07:28.440]  live events come back or even online events where actually, you know, people have figured
[07:28.440 --> 07:33.300]  out how to get a thousand people to pay to come to a one or one and a half hour essentially
[07:33.300 --> 07:39.040]  podcast taping with video. So there's, that world is growing maybe faster. But again,
[07:39.040 --> 07:45.000]  if you already have a podcast with the audience that makes it worthwhile to, you know, as
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.520]  bringing in enough money from ads and other sources, then is Apple's solution anything?
[07:49.520 --> 07:54.280]  So I feel like it's a great way for them to try something out. And it's kind of the, a
[07:54.280 --> 07:57.520]  long tail solution. I don't think the big head there of people doing really, really
[07:57.520 --> 08:01.400]  well already are going to care much about it because it's another thing to feed, another
[08:01.400 --> 08:05.880]  mechanism to deal with. And the people are kind of in the, we put Dave Sifri way back
[08:05.880 --> 08:10.520]  in Technorati, he described it, the magic middle is people who have a reasonable audience
[08:10.520 --> 08:14.160]  who's talking about blogs, but reasonable audience, but they're not huge, but, but they
[08:14.160 --> 08:18.160]  have, you know, sizable and they can do something supportive. And my wifi blog was in that area.
[08:18.160 --> 08:22.520]  You know, I've had podcasts like New Disruptors for a while. It was like that where it wasn't,
[08:22.520 --> 08:27.200]  I didn't have a hundred thousands of downloads, but I had tens of thousands and that was enough
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.660]  to bring in enough revenue to let me focus enough time and pay for editing and all the
[08:31.660 --> 08:35.920]  rest of it. So I don't, I don't know exactly who this first pass of podcast subscriptions
[08:35.920 --> 08:42.840]  serves, but I don't think it's really you. Maybe, maybe it is for your pay podcast, but,
[08:42.840 --> 08:44.960]  but I don't know, I mean, you already have a thing in place and you don't give anybody
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.560]  any money and you already reach an audience that knows you. So maybe not.
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.520]  It took me, it took me a while to, to really firm up my opinion about this podcast initiative
[08:54.520 --> 09:02.720]  subscriptions from Apple. And I would say first, it's very, it's not surprising to me,
[09:02.720 --> 09:10.840]  but it is a relief that none of it seems the least bit destructive to Apple podcasts as
[09:10.840 --> 09:16.480]  we know it, which in addition to being an app that you can use to listen to podcasts
[09:16.480 --> 09:24.040]  is also this stewardship of the iTunes directory and allowing it to be an open API. I mean,
[09:24.040 --> 09:28.360]  anybody who listens to ATP knows from, from Marco Arment who makes a third party podcast
[09:28.360 --> 09:33.280]  player that uses the iTunes API, that it's, it's the backbone of the whole podcasting
[09:33.280 --> 09:41.320]  industry. Android podcast apps are allowed to, and do use the iTunes directory. I mean,
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.960]  Google for their own app, you know, there's a certain point where it's, I think distasteful,
[09:45.960 --> 09:51.020]  you know, Google is big enough to build their own podcast directory, but like an indie app
[09:51.020 --> 09:55.960]  can do that. And, and they haven't done anything that's the least bit destructive to that in
[09:55.960 --> 10:02.320]  terms of, oh, you know, now all of a sudden free podcasts don't show up because we really
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.860]  want to steer as many people as possible podcast makers to use this proprietary subscription
[10:08.860 --> 10:12.760]  thing. So I'm glad they didn't do that. So I feel like the worst case scenario is if
[10:12.760 --> 10:19.620]  the subscription thing is sort of a bust, no harm done to us as podcast listeners, no
[10:19.620 --> 10:28.860]  harm done to me as a podcast professional for, you know, it sounds weird, but it's true.
[10:28.860 --> 10:32.880]  So there's that. And I think that's good. And I don't think that being heavy handed
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.000]  would do them any favors, but the weird thing about it is I'm not quite sure who it is for.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.840]  Right. Like you kind of got at this, like if, if you're more in that Kevin Kelly thousand
[10:42.840 --> 10:48.020]  true fans area where you're looking and, and, uh, Craig, Mon and I talked about this sort
[10:48.020 --> 10:53.000]  of demographic of creators extensively on the last episode of my show.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.420]  That was, that was great. I'm a big, I wanted Craig to do the Craig Mod cast years ago and
[10:58.420 --> 11:02.560]  he, he finally launched the podcast. He didn't call it that. And I'm devastated, but that's
[11:02.560 --> 11:07.040]  sort of what put me in mind to talk to you about being on next. Cause he got, yeah, I
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.400]  can't talk to Craig. I don't think we talked much typography on the show, but we've been
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.680]  talking, I talked to zero off about the typography of his books and, and then I, that got me
[11:15.680 --> 11:21.680]  thinking about you anyway, but that, that thousand true fan idea, it works and the internet
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.320]  makes it possible in a way that it was, it was possible on the local scale in the old
[11:28.320 --> 11:34.560]  pre-internet days where you could have like a band who was, you know, like big in Philadelphia
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.100]  and they could all, every weekend they were playing somewhere and you know, and they were,
[11:39.100 --> 11:44.920]  they could make a living as musicians, uh, locally without having any national stature.
[11:44.920 --> 11:51.360]  You know, there are examples of that, but for the most part, you couldn't, I couldn't
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.400]  do what I do without the internet. There's just no way I couldn't, I could have my own
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.440]  printing press and print up Daring Fireball as a weekly zine and it's, I would not have
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.160]  enough customers who I could distribute it to. I really couldn't. Maybe it'd be more
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.960]  of a possibility if I moved to, you know, the Silicon Valley and you know, but it's
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.160]  really hard. There was that guy who lived, uh, what's his name? Mark Anderson who lived
[12:16.160 --> 12:20.400]  on, uh, I think he still does live on Bainbridge Island in the Seattle area or not, I'm sorry,
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.880]  would be, which a little more road to get there by ferry or driving from the north.
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.480]  And he ran, was it like technology news service and it was a mailed newsletter and he charged
[12:27.480 --> 12:32.040]  a fortune for it and everybody in the world seemed to subscribe to it. But it was one
[12:32.040 --> 12:38.920]  guy, one guy could do that. There definitely were, there were expensive print newsletters
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.160]  before the internet, but I'll tell you, here's something funny though, the paid,
[12:44.160 --> 12:47.520]  the podcast thing. So, uh, you know, I did new disruptors for a couple of years back
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.780]  several years ago and, and, um, and you know, did like a hundred episodes. It was great.
[12:51.780 --> 12:55.040]  And people asked me if I'd reboot it and I did a Kickstarter and raised enough money
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.720]  again to cover sort of editing costs and time and whatever, you know, and do some live events
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.360]  and so forth and, uh, and did a year's run of it. And I found the weirdest problem wasn't
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.520]  my interest because I love talking to people about how they find their own way to do their
[13:07.520 --> 13:10.660]  own thing. Like, you know, you were on the original run of it and there's just so many
[13:10.660 --> 13:14.080]  interesting people out there. Here's the reason I didn't keep doing it in the second
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.080]  boot a couple of years ago, could not get enough guests because nearly, I wouldn't
[13:19.080 --> 13:25.200]  say all creators, but Kickstarter, Indiegogo to a lower extent, things like sub stack,
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.800]  uh, member, member, member full and a Patreon and a few other things. They basically have
[13:30.800 --> 13:34.880]  filled the zone for independent creators trying to figure out how to fund themselves. And
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.360]  if you can achieve a sufficient ignition for either part or all of your living, you have
[13:40.360 --> 13:45.040]  all these platforms to use, many of which take very little of your money. And if those
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.320]  don't work for you, there's almost no other way to do it. So it's not that independent
[13:49.320 --> 13:54.280]  creators have been locked out, whether they're cartoonists or podcasters or writers or whatever,
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.720]  it's more like the zone is full. So I would try to find somebody who was doing anything
[13:58.720 --> 14:03.000]  unique that hadn't been done and charted their own course. It was like, well, I just
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.040]  use Patreon and then I do this thing. It's like, oh, well, that's not as interesting
[14:06.040 --> 14:09.760]  to say, like 10 people on in a row who said, yeah, I use Patreon. That kind of solves everything
[14:09.760 --> 14:14.080]  for me. Uh, so that's where I think Apple's walking into that void where they're not
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.480]  void, but that filled space where they're saying, what are you doing different for people,
[14:17.480 --> 14:21.640]  Apple? And again, it may be useful for people who haven't done anything yet and maybe there'll
[14:21.640 --> 14:25.680]  be some stars or some new things that come out of there, or maybe it produces enough
[14:25.680 --> 14:32.040]  revenue for smaller podcasters to produce a more vibrant and a broader, uh, less, you
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.920]  know, more niche podcasting market that doesn't have to achieve a level where people can put
[14:35.920 --> 14:39.040]  more of their time and effort in. So that, I don't know. I don't know.
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.320]  Well, so I just see it that in that, in that market, it's just, it's just a non-starter
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.320]  to me that you don't, you don't get a relationship with the people who are paying for it. Right.
[14:48.320 --> 14:52.480]  And I, I'm not, I'm not faulting Apple for setting it up this way, but I, you know, and
[14:52.480 --> 14:55.920]  it's, but it's a longstanding complaint that independent developers who are used to the
[14:55.920 --> 15:00.840]  Mac world, where you, you know, you buy the software from the software maker and they
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.680]  get your email and then when you lose your serial number or you have tech support, you
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.000]  know, they, they could see that you're a customer and they can offer you upgrade pricing and
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.680]  blah, blah, blah. I get the privacy angle that nope, you, you subscribe, you subscribe
[15:13.680 --> 15:19.840]  to with Apple. And all I find out as a podcaster with a paid podcast and Apple podcasts is
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.560]  now I have another $5 a month coming from somebody and I don't know who, but it doesn't
[15:25.560 --> 15:30.120]  work with that whole like, Hey, what if you do want to have live shows for your followers?
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.840]  What if you want to offer them, you know, if you're doing like a book, a physical
[15:34.840 --> 15:38.840]  book, right? Which you've done, which Craig Mott has done or, or a print, you know, like
[15:38.840 --> 15:43.360]  you're an artist and you're doing prints to put on the wall, but you want to offer
[15:43.360 --> 15:49.760]  them to your members first, which is a super common frequent thing to do. That is like
[15:49.760 --> 15:54.720]  win, win, win, right? Cause it makes the people feel it's another source of income for
[15:54.720 --> 15:59.360]  the creator, but it makes the members feel good because they enjoy getting your work
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.400]  because they like your work, which is why they became a member. You know, you don't
[16:03.400 --> 16:07.760]  get that with this, whereas you do with all of these other systems. And then at the other
[16:07.760 --> 16:16.120]  end of the scale with like the super big Joe Rogan's and Dave Chappelle's and you know,
[16:16.120 --> 16:23.040]  just whoever the biggest name podcasts that you can think of. I seriously wonder if I
[16:23.040 --> 16:27.680]  look at it and I just think I thought the same thing with Joe Rogan frankly, but I just
[16:27.680 --> 16:34.000]  look at it and think there it's great that no one company totally dominates podcasts,
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.580]  but because they don't know one podcast, even, even Spotify, even iTunes is a big enough
[16:40.580 --> 16:48.520]  platform, right? Like if you're that big, like for me, my audience, can I say, can I,
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.520]  can I produce something for pay that would only work on Apple platforms? Yeah, definitely.
[16:53.520 --> 17:00.520]  In fact, it might be a waste of time for honestly, if I were to do something to do Android. But
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.680]  on the other hand, why, if I could do it on the web, why not just do it on the web? Right.
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.400]  Which is how dithering works, but for the truly mega celebrities can like a Dave Chappelle
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.840]  do a page show that doesn't show up for Android users.
[17:14.840 --> 17:17.260]  Here's what I dig though. When you're describing that, I realized, Oh yeah, this is the missing
[17:17.260 --> 17:23.020]  piece is Apple just needs to integrate. And I say just, but the next like Apple podcast
[17:23.020 --> 17:30.140]  subscriptions 2.0, what it offers is in show notes, it offers Apple pay to buy stuff, right?
[17:30.140 --> 17:34.340]  And if you're a subscriber, you can give them a discount on that. And then, so the Apple
[17:34.340 --> 17:38.000]  pay thing is like, Hey, I'm Craig Maude and this is my podcast. And if you're a member,
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.560]  you know, if you're a subscriber, you get X dollars off my next book, just open up your
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.360]  podcast app right now and go to iTunes and you'll see a thing right there right now.
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.400]  And you can double tap and you'll get the discount because you're a subscriber. If you're
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.840]  not a subscriber, subscriber to way that you can still get the discount. I mean, that is
[17:52.840 --> 17:58.000]  a powerful pull and I don't mind, you know, and again, Apple is good about like that digital
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.840]  versus physical thing. So you'd probably have to pay them 30% as usual for a digital good.
[18:01.840 --> 18:04.640]  But if it's a physical good, maybe they'd let you put a different method of payment
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.980]  or let you use Apple pay and it doesn't, you know, whatever. But, but like that kind of
[18:08.980 --> 18:13.500]  power of buy a thing in the podcast app that I'm talking about right now or later, go back
[18:13.500 --> 18:19.600]  to the podcast app cause I'm driving or whatever. That'd be a huge integration. Even if I don't
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.960]  know that person before they buy, when they buy, they have to, you know, I have to get
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.600]  their address or some limited piece of information that they've allowed me to obtain in order
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.600]  to fulfill a thing.
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.040]  Yeah, but I don't understand how, how would it get to them? Cause you don't know their
[18:32.040 --> 18:33.040]  address, right?
[18:33.040 --> 18:35.440]  Well, no, they'd have to, I mean, you know, and when you do an Apple pay transaction,
[18:35.440 --> 18:36.440]  you have to get people.
[18:36.440 --> 18:39.200]  Oh, I see Apple pay, not, not in app. That was where I was missing.
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.840]  Yeah. So it would be, but it would be exactly that is that it's in, you know, you build
[18:42.840 --> 18:48.360]  it into the podcast app and then it's an integrated thing where Apple still controls the privacy
[18:48.360 --> 18:54.000]  aspects and you're disclosed what you're providing as a buyer to the podcaster. So it doesn't
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.820]  build a relationship like you're building a mailing list, but it builds a relationship
[18:56.820 --> 19:01.480]  like you can actually sell somebody something or get them to participate in something. So
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.440]  that might be a 2.0 thing, but maybe not. Maybe this is just Apple, you know, messing
[19:06.440 --> 19:11.000]  around because they want to test the waters and then they go and they buy Patreon or they,
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.440]  they buy the last independent podcasting company that's not available. I don't know. Something
[19:15.440 --> 19:16.520]  like that.
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.680]  I don't know. I just don't know that it's a good fit. And then the other thing, Ben
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.360]  Thompson and I touched on this, but we kind of, I kind of came to this conclusion at the
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.480]  end of the today's episode of dithering, which is, wait, wouldn't the solution to this be
[19:29.480 --> 19:35.800]  an Android version of Apple podcasts, you know, which they do for Apple music. And it
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.560]  caused us to both double take while we were recording and double check and make sure that
[19:39.560 --> 19:44.520]  that wasn't a thing, you know, because there is, I know there's Apple music and would that
[19:44.520 --> 19:52.220]  be popular? I don't know. I mean, Apple's, Apple's forays off their own platforms have
[19:52.220 --> 20:00.520]  been relatively not, not very popular. I mean, I, you know, Safari for windows did not take
[20:00.520 --> 20:04.000]  off and it's, it's one of those things like, I don't know how many people even remember
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.600]  that there was Safari for windows. Um, but it's fascinating to think alike and see what
[20:09.600 --> 20:14.840]  Chrome did to the browser industry and think about the potential that was there. And it
[20:14.840 --> 20:20.960]  just did not click with windows users. I, you know, I'm not a windows user. I don't,
[20:20.960 --> 20:25.480]  I don't know. I did. I remember like kicking the tires somewhere where I saw a Safari running
[20:25.480 --> 20:32.180]  on a windows machine, but you know, it, that wasn't popular. iTunes was kind of popular,
[20:32.180 --> 20:36.220]  but was it really popular because it was a good music playing app for windows or was
[20:36.220 --> 20:42.020]  it because everybody wanted an iPod and if you had a windows PC, you therefore used iTunes.
[20:42.020 --> 20:47.400]  It seemed, and it also seems like the complaints from windows users were just a magnified version
[20:47.400 --> 20:52.080]  of the complaints from Mac users where it started as, you know, like a liked, if not
[20:52.080 --> 20:58.320]  beloved app. And then as it grew in scope over the years, it became less and less popular.
[20:58.320 --> 21:02.540]  Yeah. And it's still like that, right? Cause iTunes is now just this giant mess on windows
[21:02.540 --> 21:08.360]  because it's been broken up into its constituent parts and, and rethought for Mac OS. But now
[21:08.360 --> 21:13.040]  it doesn't even, it doesn't even have the focus of Mac designers trying to at least,
[21:13.040 --> 21:16.360]  you know, make it, if you want to work with your photos on windows, just open up iTunes.
[21:16.360 --> 21:22.180]  Like why would I do? No. So I don't even know if an Android version of Apple podcasts would
[21:22.180 --> 21:27.520]  help because if it doesn't actually get, you know, the fact that it could exist doesn't
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.240]  mean, I don't know. It, the only thing that would pull it would be something like, you
[21:32.240 --> 21:36.680]  know, to subscribe to this podcast, you need Apple podcasts for Android. And then, so how
[21:36.680 --> 21:43.120]  does, who is promoting that where millions of Android users suddenly download the app
[21:43.120 --> 21:47.520]  or does Apple do Android specific? I mean, I don't know. It's, you don't, you can't forget
[21:47.520 --> 21:52.800]  how people would get it. So the Apple podcasts would have to be huge. Like Apple TV plus
[21:52.800 --> 21:56.900]  is a great example though, John, cause I was researching a, you know, I've written a million
[21:56.900 --> 22:00.040]  books now, so I've always got like, whenever Apple breathes, I have to like go back and
[22:00.040 --> 22:03.800]  update four different books. And so I was looking at take control of Apple ID. This
[22:03.800 --> 22:08.000]  is one of my favorite books because I wrote it because Joe Kissel and I were kicking around,
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.480]  like, what's the next book idea. And it's like, what's the pain points like Apple ID.
[22:11.480 --> 22:16.200]  So I wrote a book about, you know, here's how to solve half the book is solving problems.
[22:16.200 --> 22:20.720]  But so I was digging into Apple TV plus for an update and I was like, okay, what platforms
[22:20.720 --> 22:26.640]  can you use it on? And the answer is like, goddamn everything. It is the most ridiculously
[22:26.640 --> 22:31.360]  well supported thing Apple has ever made. I think arguably you could probably play it
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.480]  on a Android watch with a browser in it. Like, you know, it's, it's any, it's practically
[22:36.480 --> 22:43.480]  any browser, any platform, any smart TV with the right support, like Apple TV plus works
[22:43.480 --> 22:47.040]  everywhere because they've got the content poll. I want to watch Ted Lasso. I need Apple
[22:47.040 --> 22:51.280]  TV plus let me watch another thing I want to. And Apple says yes, where most of the
[22:51.280 --> 22:55.960]  time Apple says no. So that's what they'd have to do with podcasts. Have compelling
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.360]  original content or exclusive content that was so compelling that people sought it out
[23:00.360 --> 23:06.960]  and they downloaded in the millions onto their Android or phones or windows devices. I mean,
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.840]  Ted Lasso, I don't know. I suspect Ted Lasso resulted in, you know, I want to say like
[23:10.840 --> 23:15.760]  a million Apple TV plus subscriptions or installations or whatever of things.
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.800]  I wonder, I wonder. I mean, and that was one of the early announcements too, right? That
[23:19.800 --> 23:23.360]  was, was that one of the, maybe there's more announcements in those first five minutes
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.840]  that I'm giving them credit for. They, they pre-announced that the next season will start
[23:26.840 --> 23:33.080]  in July. There was my family's day. Holy cow. We were just like, you know, one of the producers
[23:33.080 --> 23:36.120]  is on Twitter. And of course, as you can on Twitter, you're like, Hey, what's the next
[23:36.120 --> 23:39.240]  season coming? He's like, Oh, it'll be this fall. Don't worry. Like he said this weeks
[23:39.240 --> 23:42.840]  ago, like it's coming. We've done it like Jesus. And then when it was July, it was like,
[23:42.840 --> 23:48.740]  Oh yeah, you don't have to wait until September for it. It is funny. I wish I could give credit.
[23:48.740 --> 23:54.440]  It's sort of an obvious observation, but somebody, somebody put it so well, which was that, Hey,
[23:54.440 --> 23:59.520]  remember when, before Apple TV plus came out and there were a handful of stories and like
[23:59.520 --> 24:05.440]  the only example of original content we had was the carpool karaoke and, and the weird
[24:05.440 --> 24:10.600]  no offense to it. And the weird show about, uh, it was like, uh, app, I forget what it
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.160]  was called planet of the apps. Remember this? Oh yeah. Gwyneth Paltrow and some other people.
[24:15.160 --> 24:19.480]  Yeah. What's the show that's on network TV. That's like this where we're like inventors
[24:19.480 --> 24:25.600]  come in with their crazy ideas and shark tank. So it was like shark tank for apps, but like
[24:25.600 --> 24:33.380]  with Gary Vaynerchuk who I love, but, but it was not, it was not people who took and
[24:33.380 --> 24:38.000]  I didn't take it. I didn't think like, well, I think these two shows are probably emblematic
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.880]  of everything Apple will come up with. I thought they, I just thought they can't be, but it's
[24:43.880 --> 24:49.440]  not an unreasonable, it wasn't unreasonable for people to jump to the conclusion that
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.660]  maybe they were emblematic of what Apple was coming up with. And while before any of these
[24:53.660 --> 24:58.140]  shows came out, there were a couple of stories. I think the wall street journal, I think trip
[24:58.140 --> 25:03.860]  Mickel had the one that was the most widely reported that Apple was, uh, Eddie Q and Tim
[25:03.860 --> 25:08.680]  Cook were being two hands on and we're giving these notes. Tim Cook in particular was giving
[25:08.680 --> 25:14.280]  notes that they should, can't you make this nicer? And, and then there was the rumors
[25:14.280 --> 25:18.440]  be no new, no nudity, but no, uh, no adult themes or something where it was all going
[25:18.440 --> 25:23.520]  to be nicey, nicey stuff that kind of came out. Yeah. Something like that. And it's like,
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.120]  and in hindsight, that's really has not played out at all yet. Nobody's attracted it. I was
[25:28.120 --> 25:31.600]  watching an episode of Dickinson and the other people in the room and I was like, Holy, okay,
[25:31.600 --> 25:36.760]  I need to turn this off. I haven't seen that yet, but it's, it's really good and it's,
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.520]  it's amazing. It's actually totally amazing. It's an HBO. It's the kind of thing you'd
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.040]  be like, Oh, you could only see that on something like HBO before, which is a lot of what you
[25:44.040 --> 25:50.320]  say about Apple TV plans. Yeah. Servant is the one I think of, um, it's well, we're addicted
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.320]  to it. I think it's pretty good. It's interesting cause it's a horror drama, but the, but the
[25:55.320 --> 26:03.080]  episodes are only a half an hour. And I, I find that format to be fascinating and yes,
[26:03.080 --> 26:07.280]  like all streaming things. And again, what a boon to the creative arts. Sometimes they're
[26:07.280 --> 26:12.480]  33 minutes, sometimes they're 27 minutes. You don't have to make it exactly 27 colon
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.880]  zero zero every single episode. Oh, it's been so great. I have so many series on different
[26:17.880 --> 26:21.920]  streaming services. That's it. I think it's an excellent point, but there are some really,
[26:21.920 --> 26:28.400]  really sick, twisted, gory, perverted stuff in servant. And it's like, I think, I think
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.360]  Apple had never made any kind of content of its own. Like the closest thing was stuff
[26:33.360 --> 26:36.960]  they did during the Apple keynote and it's like, and now we're a studio. It's like, well,
[26:36.960 --> 26:40.000]  what's that going to be like? It's going to be like car park. It's going to be these very
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.720]  limited things. And then they've, they've totally proven us wrong. Those who thought
[26:44.720 --> 26:49.180]  it was going to be somewhat boring or anodyne. Yeah, totally. I, I, you know, I think they
[26:49.180 --> 26:53.240]  hired good people and let them do their work, you know, which is sort of what Eddie Q said
[26:53.240 --> 26:57.240]  in response to those accusations. He's like, I'm not giving people notes. I don't, what
[26:57.240 --> 27:01.400]  do I know about it? His, his response paraphrasing, but he was like, I don't know anything about
[27:01.400 --> 27:05.000]  making TV shows. So I found good people who know how to make, who know how to make good
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.240]  TV shows. And they're like the opposite of Quibi, right? Is that they, it's totally the
[27:10.240 --> 27:16.560]  opposite of Quibi. But anyway, I, how funny though, is it that even though there are several
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.080]  counter examples of shows with, you know, truly adult content and themes that, that
[27:22.080 --> 27:29.240]  the breakthrough hit of Apple TV plus is this show that is truly about the nicest guy and
[27:29.240 --> 27:37.800]  feeling good about yourself in a way that is not corny. And it, it, it, it is kind of
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.960]  exactly what, you know, yeah, there's a lot of F word in it, but you know, that's okay.
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.480]  They didn't sign that, but no, yeah, it's like, it's a, it's like deconstructing toxic
[27:47.480 --> 27:52.200]  masculinity. Like it's a show that's both incredibly enjoyable and also shows it's like
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.280]  a blueprint of being a good man and becoming a better man. And we just watch it and we're
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.920]  just, we've watched it twice as a family here and we're just in awe of it. And you know,
[28:02.920 --> 28:06.800]  everyone is ultimately redeemable. And I have feelings about season two, like, like redemptions
[28:06.800 --> 28:07.800]  that are yet to come.
[28:07.800 --> 28:10.280]  Trenton Larkin Maybe with the exception of the guy, the old
[28:10.280 --> 28:11.640]  guy who used to own the team.
[28:11.640 --> 28:14.200]  Trenton Larkin Rupert played by a wonderful, uh, uh, with
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.840]  his, Anthony had no, uh, yeah, Tony, it's the guy from Buffy, the vampire Slayer and
[28:18.840 --> 28:21.240]  the, um, the, uh, Folger's instant coffee courses.
[28:21.240 --> 28:22.960]  Trenton Larkin But it wouldn't surprise, wouldn't surprise
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.240]  me if he sees, if we, if we see another side of him in season two, right?
[28:27.240 --> 28:28.760]  Trenton Larkin Right. Cause they're sending us, right. It's
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.600]  going to be, but it's, it's one of the best TV. I mean, I put it up there with a good
[28:32.600 --> 28:35.080]  place. It's one of the best pieces of TV made the last few years.
[28:35.080 --> 28:37.120]  Trenton Larkin It's, uh, it's really unbelievable. And
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.640]  you could just see, I, and I, it's, I, I'm not gonna pretend like I know Tim Cook well,
[28:41.640 --> 28:47.200]  but it's like, he wears part of his purse. He's very private, but you can just tell that
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.400]  he loves Ted Lasso, right? You can just tell, he just loves it.
[28:50.400 --> 28:52.840]  Trenton Larkin It's kind of a show written for him, isn't
[28:52.840 --> 28:55.800]  it? I didn't think about that. So he just said that it's like, it's about football and
[28:55.800 --> 28:56.800]  football, you know.
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.000]  Trenton Larkin Yeah. Football and fish out of water and being
[28:59.000 --> 29:04.160]  good to other people and, and being creative. And it's like, he must've got like three episodes
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.160]  of watching it and just been like this, this, this is what I was talking about.
[29:08.160 --> 29:11.600]  Trenton Larkin Oh man. That's great. Yeah. It's, uh, when
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.320]  what a delight during pandemic year to have that.
[29:13.320 --> 29:14.880]  Trenton Larkin All right. Speaking of a delight, let me take
[29:14.880 --> 29:19.560]  a break and thank our first sponsor. Oh, I don't want to put down any of the other sponsors
[29:19.560 --> 29:24.840]  on this episode. And I don't want to put on, put down any previous sponsors. I love all
[29:24.840 --> 29:33.680]  of the sponsors of the talk show, but yes, please might be at the top of the list. If
[29:33.680 --> 29:37.840]  you make your own coffee at home. And at this point, honestly, it's the whole saga, who
[29:37.840 --> 29:43.240]  doesn't? You've got to try fresh roasted beans from the crew at yes, please. They spell it.
[29:43.240 --> 29:49.280]  It's pronounced. Yes, please. But it's spelled Y E S P L Z. They are long time coffee nerds.
[29:49.280 --> 29:58.440]  Um, they're founders, Tony Knessney. You might know Knessney. I've got a note. I've got a
[29:58.440 --> 30:01.800]  note Knessney. You wouldn't believe it.
[30:01.800 --> 30:03.440]  Trenton Larkin He's, he's a friend of mine. I'm sorry to
[30:03.440 --> 30:04.440]  interrupt.
[30:04.440 --> 30:05.440]  Trenton Larkin Well, maybe it is. I don't know.
[30:05.440 --> 30:06.440]  Trenton Larkin No, I don't know. I could be wrong. I'm
[30:06.440 --> 30:10.520]  sorry. I'm totally wrong. He's better known as Tonks. And I might remember the old Tonks
[30:10.520 --> 30:17.640]  coffee company. Also his partner, Sumi Ali. They are veterans of coffee's quote, third
[30:17.640 --> 30:21.280]  wave scene. I don't even know what that means. But they are fanatical about roasting great
[30:21.280 --> 30:26.360]  coffee. Tonks coffee was great back in the day. Yes, please. Coffee today is even better.
[30:26.360 --> 30:31.320]  I honest to God do not know how it would have gotten through the last year without yes,
[30:31.320 --> 30:35.920]  please getting delivered to the house, especially about a year ago when it was really sort of
[30:35.920 --> 30:40.520]  like, hey, you don't even know if it's safe to go outside, blah, blah, blah. What a relief.
[30:40.520 --> 30:45.640]  It is fantastic coffee. I am drinking some right now. I actually brewed to keep up with
[30:45.640 --> 30:50.480]  Glenn's energy. I had to brew a second pot of coffee. But I am literally drinking some
[30:50.480 --> 30:55.060]  right now. And they believe here's the thing about this. They're total total coffee nerds,
[30:55.060 --> 31:00.320]  but that part of their nerdiness is they honestly believe that brewing a perfect cup of coffee
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.760]  should be easier than making like a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese, just hot water,
[31:04.760 --> 31:10.760]  really hot water, fresh ground coffee. There's a couple of simple, simple ways to make it.
[31:10.760 --> 31:16.480]  It is so easy. They're not trying to tell you to buy some kind of $500 gadget and spend
[31:16.480 --> 31:21.240]  half an hour just to get like a tiny little espresso thing of coffee. No, I brew a whole
[31:21.240 --> 31:26.400]  pot of coffee. It takes me like four minutes and like 30 seconds of that is paying attention.
[31:26.400 --> 31:31.720]  But man, their coffee is great. What you do, you sign up, go over to yes, please dot coffee.

[32:29.240 --> 32:34.200]  every on a schedule that is right for you. I, I'm, again, I'm drinking it right now.
[32:34.200 --> 32:38.000]  Go to yesplease.coffee and remember that promo code fireball.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.600]  Can I just say, I met Tonks in Seattle over 11 years ago. I think now I wrote the very
[32:44.600 --> 32:50.600]  first coffee shop turning wifi off to promote people talking and free up table story. I
[32:50.600 --> 32:55.240]  wrote the first, I'm going to stake that. I wrote the first and Tony was the brewer
[32:55.240 --> 33:00.920]  there in the roaster there and I met, that's when I met him and it was only 11 years ago.
[33:00.920 --> 33:06.000]  Maybe it was a little longer. It was for the New York times and a local reporter, the guy
[33:06.000 --> 33:10.080]  worked for the sky. Brian worked for the Seattle post intelligence or said, uh, and this might
[33:10.080 --> 33:14.120]  be a pure alley. You should look into it. And I wrote something on a blog and my editor
[33:14.120 --> 33:17.040]  of the New York times where I was writing at the time said, Hey, you should write that
[33:17.040 --> 33:20.680]  for us, which is the weird, it never happened before or since. And I wrote it for them and
[33:20.680 --> 33:24.040]  it went viral and like the story got ripped off and translated into Bulgarian and like
[33:24.040 --> 33:28.760]  running a Bulgarian newspaper and everyone just kept calling this poor cafe and you know,
[33:28.760 --> 33:32.520]  what are you doing? And then anyway, and then like for the next 10 years, it seemed like
[33:32.520 --> 33:37.320]  every week there was a, uh, cafe turns off internet story. And then, you know, then everyone
[33:37.320 --> 33:41.760]  had self access and hot spots. But anyway, that's, that's Tonks origin story was that
[33:41.760 --> 33:42.760]  uh,
[33:42.760 --> 33:45.760]  Oh yeah. We had nice coffee shop like that here in right next to, you know, really high
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.240]  traffic spot next to a park. And, and they, they're the first one I remember in Philadelphia
[33:50.240 --> 33:54.640]  that had it. And I know that it sounds like, Oh, roll your eyes. It's a bunch of hipsters
[33:54.640 --> 33:58.840]  who don't want, but it really was appropriate because they were, they were busy without
[33:58.840 --> 34:03.340]  people working there. And it's, it's not to say that there's anything wrong with working
[34:03.340 --> 34:08.280]  in coffee shops. I've worked in coffee shops who hasn't, you know, it's great, but it's,
[34:08.280 --> 34:12.720]  it wasn't what they were going for. Right? Like they're, they wanted a culture and it
[34:12.720 --> 34:17.440]  was just, you know, relatively, it's still there, relatively small coffee shop. And if
[34:17.440 --> 34:20.560]  they could fill it up with people who are there to socialize and talk to people they
[34:20.560 --> 34:21.880]  know, you know,
[34:21.880 --> 34:27.200]  Yeah, it's just funny, funny trends. But anyway, remember coffee? Remember going into coffee
[34:27.200 --> 34:28.200]  shops?
[34:28.200 --> 34:30.680]  Well, I'm back now. I'm, I'm going into coffee shops.
[34:30.680 --> 34:32.800]  Oh man, I'm getting close.
[34:32.800 --> 34:33.800]  Oh, we're back.
[34:33.800 --> 34:35.760]  Oh, that's great. I love that.
[34:35.760 --> 34:39.480]  What else was in the news? Let me see here. Um, there's the apple card family thing.
[34:39.480 --> 34:46.200]  Yeah, I was intrigued by that. It's just a weird, it's like, Apple's so weird. It's like,
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.240]  Hey, now you can share your card with the members of the family. It's like, you mean
[34:50.240 --> 34:52.680]  like we've been able to do for 30 or 50 years?
[34:52.680 --> 34:57.840]  I was, I was really hoping that by posting, Hey, I'm not even sure what this means that
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.360]  I would get the, cause usually when I do that, I, my readers are so helpful and it's just
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.840]  my lazy way of doing research, but crickets chirping on this, like how it sounds like
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.960]  what they're doing is something new, but is that Apple hyperbole or no? Like, is this
[35:12.960 --> 35:18.160]  different than like my wife's and my joint Amex account? And if so, how?
[35:18.160 --> 35:24.320]  I think it is. Um, I think what they're emphasizing is that like normally with a credit card,
[35:24.320 --> 35:27.520]  I mean, you know this, right? So normally the credit card, you open an account, you
[35:27.520 --> 35:31.320]  typically don't open it jointly. I mean, sometimes you have to put down both parties income and
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.440]  a married couple or whatever, and you can get extra cards, uh, and you, if for family
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.640]  members and whatever, but somebody is usually like the person who the card is in their name,
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.640]  like the main account holder, primary care card holder. Right. Yeah. And I think this
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.800]  is more like they really are trying to make this like a family card. So they're providing
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.400]  online ways to control limits for kids. They're providing like charts and graphs and data
[35:55.400 --> 36:00.400]  and it's there. Keep talking about co-owners instead of like a primary owner and sharing.
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.640]  So I think it is a little, I think in effect it will seem the same. I think in nature it's
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.960]  actually a bit different and probably affects even like your credit rating, a little different
[36:09.960 --> 36:16.360]  report and so forth. But, um, I do, I do love the idea that they're making it. I mean, it
[36:16.360 --> 36:19.220]  really, you know, if you've got a family like you and I do, I think that's the issue is
[36:19.220 --> 36:27.080]  like if you have kids, this transforms how you manage like the budgets and controls and
[36:27.080 --> 36:31.720]  what they can do with a credit card. So it's much more of a training credit card than most
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.720]  credit card companies offer for any card. So that's kind of, I think that's my take,
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.280]  but I don't think we've seen the impact of it yet because Apple has let you, you know,
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.240]  they added those a ways to, um, uh, to set up a purchase amounts and so forth for people
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.080]  already in your family. And so as a result, this is like an extension of that. I don't
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.920]  think it seems as different. It's just all managed on, on one card and you get the higher
[36:53.920 --> 36:59.680]  percentage cash rebate. Yeah. And you know, I mean, I, I don't know, I gave him a hard
[36:59.680 --> 37:02.680]  time and it was like, what's next? You know, when they announced that they're getting into
[37:02.680 --> 37:09.760]  credit card business, payday, payday loans at the Apple store, I, you know, and I still
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.040]  am ambivalent about it and I still feel like if there's an area where they should really
[37:15.040 --> 37:20.000]  be able to brag and lead the way, it should be on the APRs that they offer. Oh God. Yeah.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.280]  It's absurd. Like I think that, you know, that the, the, uh, what does APR stand for
[37:27.280 --> 37:31.680]  even annual annual percentage rate, annualized percentage rate, annualized percentage rate
[37:31.680 --> 37:40.540]  and then 10.99 to 21.99 as of April 1st, 2020 their footnotes. Right. That's 21.99 is serious.
[37:40.540 --> 37:45.840]  It is. It is. It really, I think it was, I think like you could go back to like when
[37:45.840 --> 37:51.380]  they made up the word usury, you know, that yeah, 22%. Yeah. That's usury. That's that.
[37:51.380 --> 37:54.600]  That's not right. I don't get it. I don't get it. You know, they've got, so the credit
[37:54.600 --> 37:59.180]  card companies and Apple specifically in its financial analysis of our transactions has
[37:59.180 --> 38:04.280]  more information and can do more data transformation than whatever. And they cannot manage risk
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.500]  enough to say, here's a 3.99% credit card because we trust you or a 6% or whatever.
[38:09.500 --> 38:14.020]  They cannot manage risk well enough to issue that to people. That seems bizarre. Something
[38:14.020 --> 38:20.280]  that would be a reasonable amount of interest to carry. I mean, it's, and again, when I
[38:20.280 --> 38:24.980]  was younger, I had a ridiculous amount of credit card debt at one point. I mean, never
[38:24.980 --> 38:29.180]  enough to like, actually like get into bankruptcy, but enough where it was like, Oh, whatever,
[38:29.180 --> 38:35.440]  you know, it's a huge nut to pay every month. Yeah. And paying that off, getting out of
[38:35.440 --> 38:40.800]  it was like, Oh, never again. So I get it. Like I'm, that's not like a holier than now.
[38:40.800 --> 38:45.720]  Don't ever carry a balance on a credit card. I definitely did it. But it's like, if you
[38:45.720 --> 38:50.080]  can choose not to, you'd be insane. Even at the best interest rates they offer, like 11
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.160]  or 12%, that's really high. It's not a good deal.
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.840]  PayPal does better. I know you get these unprovoked things from PayPal. I have a business account
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.000]  there and they're like, Hey, do you want a credit line of, you know, I don't know, it's
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  like $2,500 and we'll give you, you know, a hundred dollars if you use it. And the interest
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.200]  rate is like 7%. And I was, I always pay off balances on the business side particularly.
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.440]  And I was like, yeah, I'm about to, you know, for my tiny type museum project, I was like,
[39:17.440 --> 39:20.440]  Oh, I need to send somebody here a bucks. I'm like, yes, I'll take a hundred dollars
[39:20.440 --> 39:24.520]  free. And you know, it impacts your credit limit or rating a little bit or whatever.
[39:24.520 --> 39:27.960]  So I took it, they gave me a hundred bucks. I was like, I think it was a hundred dollars
[39:27.960 --> 39:31.240]  and I paid it off within the period of time that it was 0%. So I didn't pay anything for
[39:31.240 --> 39:34.320]  it. They just gave me money. And I was like, well, you trusted me. You gave me a low interest
[39:34.320 --> 39:38.360]  rate and you gave me money to do this. And you're PayPal, right? You're not even Apple
[39:38.360 --> 39:40.200]  and you did that. So why, you know?
[39:40.200 --> 39:44.560]  Well, it's funny. I don't want to turn this into an episode about credit, building up
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.920]  your credit, uh, because I don't really know, but, but we bought a house like five years
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.600]  ago, four or five years ago, and we were going through the mortgage process. We only had
[39:54.600 --> 39:59.280]  my wife and I only had one credit card and we'd only had that one credit card and American
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.240]  express card for like, uh, I don't know, eight, nine years. And they were like, well, you
[40:05.240 --> 40:09.120]  should have more credit cards. And I, I grew up thinking that that was, that was the, you
[40:09.120 --> 40:13.240]  know, that having lots of credit cards was bad credit. Like, Oh, red flag. This guy's
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.920]  got six, six lines of credit from six different banks.
[40:16.920 --> 40:21.000]  You show your credit worthy by having credit that you're not using. So you want to have
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.160]  probably want you to have like $60,000 worth of credit limits across your cards and you're
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.160]  using like 10 or 20 of it at any given time or none, but you have to have them open. It's
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.800]  just, it's the weirdest thing. It's like you're more credit worthy when you have too much
[40:36.800 --> 40:38.200]  debt than you are when you don't.
[40:38.200 --> 40:41.320]  I remember my wife was talking to this woman from the mortgage company. She said, well,
[40:41.320 --> 40:44.360]  don't you, what about like a target card or something? And my wife is like, are you out
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.200]  of your mind? We're buying a house. What, why would it matter if I have a target card?
[40:50.200 --> 40:55.600]  You know, it was crazy. And we're like, well, wait, what should we do? I mean, like, should
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.240]  we get another credit card? And they're like, Oh no, not now. Not when we're actually looking
[41:00.240 --> 41:05.160]  at you for a mortgage. And it all worked out, you know, and, and, you know, it, it, it worked
[41:05.160 --> 41:09.800]  out in the end, but afterwards, once we had the mortgage, we were like, Oh, I guess we
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.720]  get to get more credit cards. And you know, now we've got like an American Airlines one
[41:13.720 --> 41:18.880]  that we only use when we're buying airfare, you know, and it's like, it's so, it, it's
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.720]  all worse. And then of course I bought, I got the Apple card cause I figured I should
[41:23.720 --> 41:28.000]  write about it. Now I've got that. It was so much easier when I had one credit card
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.320]  because then I never had, I never had to think. I never, never ever had to think just here.
[41:32.320 --> 41:35.120]  We were earning miles for a while. We had a United card and we have, you know, hundreds
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.440]  of thousands of United miles, which we, some day we'll use to go back to Europe, I hope.
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.960]  But I've now have cards where I get the Apple card, another one where I get 2% for transactions
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.400]  and the Apple one, I'll do it whenever I can use Apple pay. And the other one is when I
[41:47.400 --> 41:51.720]  have to do like an in store and I, I've got face ID on my phone and like, so I'll put
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.460]  in or tap the other cards, city card and just get 2%. I'm like, I want 2% back at everything
[41:56.460 --> 42:00.160]  I do cause I don't need miles right now. And it's, so I'm, you know, I'm getting 2% cash
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.160]  back. So I'll take that.
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.580]  Yeah. I was doing the thing where I was using my Apple card for all the Apple pay payments
[42:05.580 --> 42:11.760]  cause you get 3% or whatever or I don't know what are you getting? You get 3% for Apple
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.100]  pay, but 3% from Apple and selected partners. So I switched to T-Mobile and I changed it.
[42:18.100 --> 42:22.440]  So now I only use that card to pay my Apple bills. So like my iTunes monthly, anything
[42:22.440 --> 42:27.040]  I buy from Apple, I put on that card and anything else I just don't cause the extra 1% just
[42:27.040 --> 42:31.720]  wasn't worth it. It's like, I just, just, just let me use my one credit card. Anyway,
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.280]  now Apple's in the credit card business and they've improved it. What else? What is next
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.840]  on the list? Air tags. Oh man.
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.200]  Yeah. I'm, I'm really into this because yeah, so I I've written, you know, I've written
[42:46.200 --> 42:52.160]  about like find my Mac for years and years. And so I was totally prime when the COVID-19
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.160]  exposure notification thing came out. I don't get briefings from Apple that much anymore.
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.400]  And and one of the folks over there is like, Hey, you need to be heads up about this thing
[43:00.400 --> 43:03.400]  because we know you do this. And it's like, Oh, okay. What is it? And you know, and there's
[43:03.400 --> 43:10.400]  the COVID tracking business was basically find my COVID exposure. It was the same thing.
[43:10.400 --> 43:16.520]  I mean, much more sophisticated and security leaning like privacy preserving. But AirTags
[43:16.520 --> 43:19.800]  is basically, you know, it just relies on that same thing they built a couple of years
[43:19.800 --> 43:29.080]  ago, which is a distributed crowdsourced anonymous Bluetooth beacon based system. But adding
[43:29.080 --> 43:37.120]  in ultra wide band and NFC to it and you know, tagging it to devices you carry with you.
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.280]  So it's pretty slick. I mean, it's what I mean, I realized tiles came up with this before
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.440]  like they were the original developer of it, but there's a critical mass thing and it's
[43:46.440 --> 43:52.160]  like suddenly, you know, as Apple rolls this out, you've got I don't know, 100 million,
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.960]  well probably hundreds of millions of devices worldwide that will send back information
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.360]  about it is a thing. It is in fact, a billion devices that billion that can get are qualified.
[44:02.360 --> 44:06.720]  Yeah, which is crazy. Like somebody that's wild. Yeah, talking to Apple last week. They're
[44:06.720 --> 44:12.720]  like, I know it sounds crazy, but it's actually up to a billion devices that are participating.
[44:12.720 --> 44:20.280]  It is amazing. It is truly a fascinating system. And it's not unlike a lot of crypto type stuff.
[44:20.280 --> 44:25.600]  It's not even that hard to sort of see as a layperson, you know, get up in front of
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.680]  a whiteboard and start talking. All right, these identifiers rotate the identifiers,
[44:30.680 --> 44:37.760]  there's no backwards table mapping the identifier exactly to use. So even if you know the identifier
[44:37.760 --> 44:44.080]  of an air tag, it's just a unique thing. And then it calls home and home just says, okay,
[44:44.080 --> 44:54.340]  air tag 111234 is here. Nobody knows who's it is. And you know, it's somebody walks by
[44:54.340 --> 44:57.960]  with an iPhone and the iPhone picks up the beacon. It's like, Oh, yeah, there it is.
[44:57.960 --> 45:01.160]  It's right there. You know, it's literally like if you'd written a tag number on a piece
[45:01.160 --> 45:03.760]  of equipment, you know, and you're like a little pink tag, you stuck on it and said
[45:03.760 --> 45:08.960]  175392, whatever, right? And someone if they found it, they picked it up. And they go like,
[45:08.960 --> 45:13.360]  Oh, and they just like mail it into some central address postage paid. And that central address
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.060]  is like, Oh, that belongs to it's even more secure private than that. That belongs to
[45:17.060 --> 45:20.440]  Glenn and they call me up to say, Hey, we found it or more likely I would call up and
[45:20.440 --> 45:23.340]  say, Hey, do you have an item and it's got this number on it? They say, Yeah, would you
[45:23.340 --> 45:27.140]  send that to me? Sure. I mean, it's, it's practically that simple with more cryptography
[45:27.140 --> 45:34.560]  and anonymity. But it's kind of like a, you know, a global lost and found system where
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.400]  the person finding it has no idea what they've found. They don't touch it. It's just they
[45:38.400 --> 45:43.040]  don't even know their devices transmitting these anonymous tags back to Apple. And the
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.600]  person who lost it doesn't have to disclose anything about themselves in order to claim
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.420]  it. Just the proof that they, you know, essentially they tell your machine tells Apple when you're
[45:51.420 --> 45:55.820]  using the find my system on your end, it tells Apple like, Hey, cryptographically, you should
[45:55.820 --> 45:59.140]  release any information that matches this pattern. And Apple says, that's great. We
[45:59.140 --> 46:02.580]  don't know what's in it, but here you go. We know there's a match and that's the only
[46:02.580 --> 46:07.260]  thing they know about you, but they don't know the coordinates or any other data inside.
[46:07.260 --> 46:12.680]  I know that Apple has to keep rotating some of their big messaging things. Cause you can't
[46:12.680 --> 46:17.040]  just keep repeating yourself time after time. But you know, for a while they had the a thousand
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.620]  knows for every yes that they emphasize once or twice. And then for a while, I'm not sure
[46:21.620 --> 46:26.300]  which came first, but there was, there was a couple of things that was only Apple, right?
[46:26.300 --> 46:32.220]  Only Apple could do blank, but this, this find my network, I really do want to say is
[46:32.220 --> 46:39.060]  sort of an only Apple thing. Like who else could do this? I mean, Google has the technical
[46:39.060 --> 46:51.300]  chops for sure, but I don't know if it's feasible for them to, to work that into Android without
[46:51.300 --> 46:55.020]  designing the actual Android handsets for everybody around the world.
[46:55.020 --> 46:59.100]  That's my thinking. It's also, I think the ultra wide band aspect of it is, uh, you know,
[46:59.100 --> 47:04.460]  is a huge deal, even though, excuse me, even though it's only part of the product. I mean,
[47:04.460 --> 47:09.540]  I guess, you know, this is like, this is a multi purpose or multi part device. It's,
[47:09.540 --> 47:14.860]  you know, here's how you find something that's nearby to you because of ultra wide band.
[47:14.860 --> 47:18.220]  And then there's the Bluetooth LE part, which people could replicate. But right. I mean,
[47:18.220 --> 47:22.580]  so tiles and again, no offense to the company. They came up with a very clever idea. They
[47:22.580 --> 47:26.940]  implemented it and they just, you know, do they, I don't know what critical mass they
[47:26.940 --> 47:30.580]  have. Like they have a lot of people using tiles, but they don't have a billion people
[47:30.580 --> 47:36.260]  running tiles app and that's what they needed to make this work. And so I know why they
[47:36.260 --> 47:40.660]  are peeved about it. And I think with this in place and Apple opening it up to third
[47:40.660 --> 47:45.220]  parties, we're going to see, you know, does Apple cut them some deal? Do they settle and
[47:45.220 --> 47:48.580]  just say, look, we're going to make you a feature, put them in the app store or Apple
[47:48.580 --> 47:53.580]  store and whatever. But this is, it doesn't diminish the utility of a third party product
[47:53.580 --> 47:58.020]  that Apple selling this because Apple is selling their own very specific thing. There's not
[47:58.020 --> 48:03.420]  even a key ring holder on the device, you know, so it's very idiosyncratic version
[48:03.420 --> 48:04.420]  of it.
[48:04.420 --> 48:11.100]  Tiles complaint is, you know, and they're, they're in cahoots with Epic, you know, with
[48:11.100 --> 48:17.620]  the app, what's the app Alliance, whatever it's called. Uh, I forget the name of it.
[48:17.620 --> 48:25.220]  The Alliance of sore losers, sour grapes commission app fairness Alliance. Is that, is that right?
[48:25.220 --> 48:28.740]  Maybe it's a, it's yeah, it's something generic, but right. But you know, they're, they're
[48:28.740 --> 48:33.340]  contention, right? Is that Apple is denying them? Oh, coalition for app fairness. Okay.
[48:33.340 --> 48:39.220]  Yeah, there we go. So it's people's Judean history front, Epic spot, Spotify and tile
[48:39.220 --> 48:46.900]  are at the forefront of it. Um, but tiles complained about this on sort of antitrust
[48:46.900 --> 48:53.540]  arguments or abuse of their position as the platform vendor. Like it sucks to be tile,
[48:53.540 --> 49:00.020]  but that doesn't mean like there's only two other ways to take tile at their word. One
[49:00.020 --> 49:09.180]  would be to allow tile to write and install system level software for the iPhone. But
[49:09.180 --> 49:15.500]  even if w you know, like in Mac parlance, like system extensions, right? So that they
[49:15.500 --> 49:20.900]  could run in the background and do things that, that only Apple can do because they,
[49:20.900 --> 49:26.180]  they can, you know, like when you bring your air tag next to your phone and you get the
[49:26.180 --> 49:31.580]  little pop up from the bottom, that's nicely animated. A third party can't do that. Third
[49:31.580 --> 49:36.900]  party can't install something that is just always listening so that if, if your product
[49:36.900 --> 49:41.020]  is brought within an inch or two of it, no matter which app you're in, it brings it up.
[49:41.020 --> 49:48.780]  That's just not how iOS software works. Um, and even if Apple were to loosen the rules
[49:48.780 --> 49:53.140]  for iOS and allow system level extensions like that, which they're not going to do,
[49:53.140 --> 49:59.060]  or if they granted a one time exception to tile so that tile could do it, which again
[49:59.060 --> 50:05.740]  is even less likely. It still doesn't give tile the billion device network because what
[50:05.740 --> 50:10.460]  is Apple going to actually bake tiles code into the version of iOS that's pushed out
[50:10.460 --> 50:17.220]  to all billion users? No, it doesn't make any sense. So there's no way I get sucks if
[50:17.220 --> 50:21.660]  your tile, but this is the sort of feature that is so much better if it's built into
[50:21.660 --> 50:26.500]  the system and there's nothing, if you don't, if you don't own the system, there's nothing
[50:26.500 --> 50:27.500]  you can do about it.
[50:27.500 --> 50:33.100]  Yeah. And Apple allowing third party access to the Find My system is the right solution.
[50:33.100 --> 50:37.500]  And I think you could argue you being tiles or you being a reasonable person, maybe Apple
[50:37.500 --> 50:40.620]  should have done this, you know, maybe this should have been considered at the launch
[50:40.620 --> 50:46.420]  when they started the crowdsourced thing that seemed very tiles like without their own tracker,
[50:46.420 --> 50:49.620]  they should have said at that point, our goal ultimately is to allow third party access
[50:49.620 --> 50:54.080]  that doesn't violate the privacy of users and yet provide or drain batteries and yet
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.340]  provides the same experience that we have in our MFI program and our blah, blah, blah.
[50:58.340 --> 51:02.420]  They could have said that and then they still could have taken, you know, eight to 15 months
[51:02.420 --> 51:05.580]  to build it out. And I think it took a bit longer than that. I think they announced that
[51:05.580 --> 51:11.180]  last summer, right? That they were going to allow access. And then the recent announcement
[51:11.180 --> 51:14.820]  was, hey, we have partners now, but they're still not available, but they will be soon.
[51:14.820 --> 51:20.340]  And then, you know, we'll approve other folks after that. So, I mean, this is at some level
[51:20.340 --> 51:25.700]  and maybe provoked by tiles actions. This is probably the ideal outcome, except that
[51:25.700 --> 51:29.740]  it's a year later than tiles or somebody else might've liked, right?
[51:29.740 --> 51:36.560]  I mean, it's a never, it's an evergreen topic in tech. And I think it's, it seems like it's
[51:36.560 --> 51:41.020]  different now because we're talking about these big tech companies like Google and Amazon
[51:41.020 --> 51:47.980]  and Apple as being more influential than at any point in the past, certainly more than,
[51:47.980 --> 51:53.040]  you know, 15, 20 years ago, right? Now, you know, ExxonMobil isn't the biggest company
[51:53.040 --> 51:56.020]  in the world. They're not even on the list. It's all of these companies that own these
[51:56.020 --> 52:00.580]  platforms. Their influence is greater, but the issue is still kind of the same. I mean,
[52:00.580 --> 52:06.640]  we in the Apple community still call it a Sherlocking where, you know, there was a Apple
[52:06.640 --> 52:13.100]  came out with a product called Sherlock and it was sort of like desktop search. And then
[52:13.100 --> 52:19.060]  it was the third party app called Watson that did it a lot better. And then like a year
[52:19.060 --> 52:24.100]  or nine months later, the next version of Sherlock was a lot more like Watson and just,
[52:24.100 --> 52:30.980]  you know, copiously borrowed good ideas. And because it was built in kind of put an end
[52:30.980 --> 52:35.980]  to Watson as a feasible product. It happens over and over again. I've written about, I
[52:35.980 --> 52:41.180]  remember the, remember the confabulators thing. There was like, they called them gadgets.
[52:41.180 --> 52:46.920]  You'd use HTML and JavaScript and C or no, there's wasn't HTML. It was like an XML format,
[52:46.920 --> 52:52.820]  but sort of like HTML and you'd use job easy to make little gadgets that you could put
[52:52.820 --> 52:59.940]  all over your desktop. And then Apple came out with dashboard with widgets for your Mac.
[52:59.940 --> 53:03.400]  And you've argued about, I think you've written this exact thing. So tell me if I'm quoting
[53:03.400 --> 53:08.060]  you back to you, which is there are some features that are obvious that Apple will eventually
[53:08.060 --> 53:12.060]  implement and may choose not to. But if the, but you know, if you build a feature like
[53:12.060 --> 53:16.100]  that into a piece of hardware software, you're going to get Sherlock probably because it's
[53:16.100 --> 53:20.380]  a matter of time, but there's other stuff that's non obvious. And when Apple does those,
[53:20.380 --> 53:24.260]  then it's like, ah, did they really, did they really have to kill that company because it's
[53:24.260 --> 53:28.060]  not a core thing and it's not obvious that it makes sense for Apple. And I think we have
[53:28.060 --> 53:34.220]  a lot more Sherlocking of obvious features and Sherlock wasn't one of those. Like Apple,
[53:34.220 --> 53:38.220]  the things that Sherlock did, Apple didn't offer most of that stuff. And then they suddenly
[53:38.220 --> 53:42.180]  did. They like put out a portmanteau of things that were very Sherlock like, but like,
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.540]  Or Watson, Watson being the third party one.
[53:44.540 --> 53:50.500]  Oh, sorry. Watson. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, right. And so the, that's what I wonder about with
[53:50.500 --> 53:57.000]  something like this, like is AirTag trying to Sherlock tiles and it's, that would be
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.660]  true if Apple wasn't also opening up its ecosystem. Like did Apple wait to release AirTag until
[54:02.660 --> 54:07.140]  the point at which it could legitimately say we have a licensing program into play place
[54:07.140 --> 54:12.080]  and we have people in the pipeline who will be able to also release stuff that is an equal
[54:12.080 --> 54:16.540]  player in our ecosystem. And again, that could have been provoked by the, you know, the threats
[54:16.540 --> 54:21.100]  and the congressional hearings and whatever, but that gives them some kind of deniability
[54:21.100 --> 54:25.620]  because they're not killing tile. Tile could easily compete with its feature set and form
[54:25.620 --> 54:30.380]  factor and other things, uh, with AirTag. It seems like to me, right. You know, I don't
[54:30.380 --> 54:34.860]  know though. It seems like they're, you know, they could, I do think that that's why AirTags
[54:34.860 --> 54:38.380]  took so long to come out. I mean, I know that it's been rumored for like two years and there
[54:38.380 --> 54:44.200]  were signs of it in the, in the OS from like two years ago. Um, it really, and, and reports
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.660]  from six, seven, eight months ago from rumor sites that, Hey, the AirTags seem ready to
[54:49.660 --> 54:54.380]  go, you know, and there were pictures of them and, and the ones that came out last week
[54:54.380 --> 54:59.740]  look exactly like the ones that were supposedly ready to come out. So it, it, it honestly
[54:59.740 --> 55:05.860]  passes the Occam's razor sniff test that they were waiting for the made for iPhone third
[55:05.860 --> 55:11.180]  party thing to be ready, which doesn't seem like it was ready until earlier this month.
[55:11.180 --> 55:14.580]  No, it's true in Apple. I should say this is the, this is the, I think the key factor
[55:14.580 --> 55:18.020]  though, and this is where I think you'd have to say, you know, what's fair here is Apple
[55:18.020 --> 55:25.220]  did remove tile from the retail stores. So that was like a year and a half ago. So I
[55:25.220 --> 55:31.220]  think it was that an issue, you know, was that retaliation against tile being involved
[55:31.220 --> 55:35.080]  and trying to get the U S government involved. And so there is something there, like if tile
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.580]  became, so let's say, so here's the scenario is if tile became a part of this, you know,
[55:40.580 --> 55:44.460]  licensing program and could use the find my network, would Apple, you know, a, would Apple
[55:44.460 --> 55:50.380]  undo it and be, if so, would Apple stock them in the, in the Apple stores again, just as
[55:50.380 --> 55:53.620]  even a nice thing, like here's another product that does this, like, here's our, find my
[55:53.620 --> 55:56.780]  selection of, of things from seven different companies, including tile.
[55:56.780 --> 56:02.020]  Right. I don't know. I mean, I think, are they going to put these $4,000 van Moof bikes
[56:02.020 --> 56:08.840]  in the store? I don't know. But they did promote, I mean, they promoted the three products that
[56:08.840 --> 56:12.860]  came out was the van Moof bikes, which apparently are very nice bikes. I don't want to make
[56:12.860 --> 56:15.900]  fun of them. They're a couple of people wrote to me, they say they have them in there for
[56:15.900 --> 56:24.740]  apparently very nice. E-bikes Belkin has sound form freedom, true wireless earbuds, clearly
[56:24.740 --> 56:30.780]  air pod competitors. They're air pods from Belkin, but they have a find my support and
[56:30.780 --> 56:36.420]  the Chipolo one spot item finder, which is, that's the thing that's like a tile truck
[56:36.420 --> 56:42.140]  tile tracker. So there, I don't know if they're going to put them in the stores, but you know,
[56:42.140 --> 56:47.700]  it's just the thing like Benedict Evans has been written about this and he's, he's dug
[56:47.700 --> 56:51.420]  up a long time ago. I don't even know if it was about this one in particular, but this
[56:51.420 --> 56:56.740]  issue of when the platform maker builds a feature in, I mean, and my rule of thumb is
[56:56.740 --> 57:03.460]  if it makes sense, if it, if it would be better built into the system and it's worth building
[57:03.460 --> 57:09.980]  into the system, it will be built into the system. And the worth part is how many people
[57:09.980 --> 57:13.620]  are actually going to use it. I mean, if it's something truly obscure, even if it would
[57:13.620 --> 57:18.860]  be built into the system, why would they, you know, they can't build every idea in there,
[57:18.860 --> 57:24.900]  but you know, for something like this, like, like the air pod support or these air tags
[57:24.900 --> 57:29.280]  now, it is worth building into the system and it makes it better. And it's, you know,
[57:29.280 --> 57:33.500]  it stinks if you're the one who had the idea, but if you've got an idea and even if it's
[57:33.500 --> 57:37.580]  just software and it's a utility and it's like, Oh man, I mean like, look at like the
[57:37.580 --> 57:44.300]  launch bar type apps, right? Like there's launch bar and Alfred and a whole bunch more.
[57:44.300 --> 57:49.940]  And those still, right, those still exist. Even though spotlight is now works like that.
[57:49.940 --> 57:54.060]  You hit command space, you type something, you hit return and boom, you get what you're
[57:54.060 --> 58:00.040]  looking for. And the trick is why are launch bar and Alfred still successful? Because they
[58:00.040 --> 58:05.620]  do so much more. They do so much more that it wouldn't make sense for Apple to build
[58:05.620 --> 58:10.660]  into the system version. Whereas the concept of a tile tracker is so simple. Here's a little
[58:10.660 --> 58:15.140]  square, you put a battery in it, you match it up with the app on your phone, and then
[58:15.140 --> 58:19.040]  you can put this tile on a backpack or in a suitcase or wherever you want. And it'll
[58:19.040 --> 58:23.620]  tell you where it is. That's it. There, there isn't, you know, it's wonderfully simple,
[58:23.620 --> 58:29.040]  but there is no level to go launch bar style. Oh, and you can write your own custom extensions
[58:29.040 --> 58:34.740]  and scripts and extensions. You know, there's, there's not a lot of room there.
[58:34.740 --> 58:38.460]  Yeah, you don't need much more except if you could do, you know, something that requires
[58:38.460 --> 58:44.260]  a lot more battery and whatever it's GPS and cellular. And there are devices like that.
[58:44.260 --> 58:50.100]  My my wife and brother in law for my late mother in law got a tracker like that they
[58:50.100 --> 58:54.620]  slipped in her purse because she started to wander. It was surprisingly compact, it charged
[58:54.620 --> 59:00.900]  fast. And it did GPS and cellular and gave you location information. But that's not what
[59:00.900 --> 59:09.060]  everybody needs. That's a specialized product. I do not mean to laugh. But isn't it because
[59:09.060 --> 59:14.220]  I and I've had, I've had relatives, you know, who've gone through similar type things. So
[59:14.220 --> 59:18.920]  we I had my mom's aunt used to shoot, I mean, she must have been 80. She kept thinking she
[59:18.920 --> 59:24.080]  was late for school. And, and her husband would end because she stayed in the same town.
[59:24.080 --> 59:30.600]  So it was the elementary school was the one she had gone to, oh, my gosh, 70 years ago,
[59:30.600 --> 59:34.260]  but she'd be there like on a Saturday morning in the rain and her nightgown there. But isn't
[59:34.260 --> 59:37.620]  it funny, though, that that that they knew she would still take her purse?
[59:37.620 --> 59:42.180]  Yeah, yeah, that's right. Right. Right. It's amazing what parts of you you keep with right
[59:42.180 --> 59:45.660]  and the rest is gone. Right. And like, she's probably a woman who, you know, when she was
[59:45.660 --> 59:49.540]  younger, just just she'd never she would never she'd no more likely leave without her purse
[59:49.540 --> 59:52.860]  than leave, you know, without shoes on.
[59:52.860 --> 59:58.460]  That's right. Yeah. So yeah, so this is not this is not a solution for that. But I think,
[59:58.460 --> 01:00:04.460]  you know, I think that's the point is I think the tile, tile or in these little devices
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:11.360]  are useful in with a very specific limited function. And you know, and also kudos, finally,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.620]  for Apple releasing something that you can just replace with a standard battery. That's
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:19.680]  kind of kind of nice for once. Right. All right. Well, all right. All right. Let me
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.220]  play devil's advocate that what what product they make should have a replaceable battery,
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.580]  but doesn't this one has to write because what else are they going to do put a lightning
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.260]  charger on it? That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, yeah, the lightning charger. And what
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:37.580]  you do is you'd have to plug it into your AirPod to charge it. Stick out of like, no,
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.460]  I'm sorry to saw another picture of the original the Apple mouse thing. I Apple mouse being
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.140]  charged by an Apple pencil. Yeah, no, I think you're right. They have to they have to but
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.380]  they I mean, the AirPods it's the I just always slightly aggrieved by the AirPods because
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.860]  I've had this discussion with other people and I know you've written about it a lot.
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:01:00.660]  It's it's could you make AirPods without with batteries that were not even user serviceable,
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.980]  but serviceable right in some fashion? And the answer is, maybe so maybe you couldn't
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:12.300]  make AirPods to Apple specifications without making them essentially an environmental problem.
[01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.820]  But anyway, so that's the big one. The rest of you know, I actually come to the point
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:21.580]  where Apple's batteries have so much in like laptops and devices like mobile devices are
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:26.940]  so good and have so much they over promise so much that I'm like and they also their
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:33.320]  battery replacement charges for your you know, the things that you can't do aren't user serviceable
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.980]  are so reasonable now. And they included them you know, you got Apple care plus it you know,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.180]  includes battery of your battery drops below whatever they replace it for free as part
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.340]  of that all those things together. I'm like, well, that kind of took care of the battery
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:50.260]  issue and the Apple does have to recycle and deal with the batteries they pull out. So
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.420]  for all of those devices now, I'm like, it's a pain that you can't replace it yourself
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.900]  anymore. The advantages probably outweigh that and it's not a ridiculous price to get
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.780]  Apple to service it if it happens. So
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:06.700]  Right. I don't know what the path out of this is. And I do know though that like, under
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:15.980]  the umbrella term right to repair that legislation is going from the grassroots to like the attention
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:24.820]  of legislators around the world. But it is and I think it's unclear to me I stake out
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:31.060]  a middle ground here where I'm not in complete defense of Apple's mostly no user servable
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:36.860]  batteries. But I also don't think it's a very cynical play either. I really do think that
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:42.240]  when you compare, it's just impossible to look at a modern iPhone and think of it as
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.260]  a device where you could somehow crack the back off. They're just so dense. They really
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:57.020]  are. And it really does take an enormous amount of three dimensional space to design a battery
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:02.540]  that can be taken in and out safely. Right. Which is a big part of it as opposed to just
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:08.060]  sealing it up. Oh, yeah. Once they got to those multiple polymer lithium ion batteries
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:14.580]  and the sort of like terrorist batteries in the 2015 MacBook, when you get to that point,
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.980]  you're actually putting people maybe in danger if they start taking it apart. Maybe danger
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.460]  is an exaggeration. But the laptops particularly, it becomes more complicated. Yeah, I would
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.380]  have to say there was a period of time when it felt like Apple was thumbing its nose at
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.880]  people a bit because they, you know, they did the pentalobe screws and they did stuff
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.780]  where they could have used a solder or a screw and they used, you know, some kind of impenetrable
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:42.100]  glue that had melted off. And you're like, that was a choice during manufacture. And
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.060]  maybe it had a manufacturing purpose that shaved, you know, one thirteenth of a cent
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:51.060]  off every device, but maybe not. And then, but then you transition into the modern era
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:55.260]  where you're like, could you make, you know, I've got a 2017 iMac and I could put more
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:00.420]  memory in it myself. Could I take out the drive? I mean, that's a huge, weird engineering
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.820]  task. So they put a slot in the back for that. Like, I don't know. And now, you know, the
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:09.180]  M1 just breaks that. Then you're like, well, what are, you know, I mean, yes, it could
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:14.660]  do something with an SSD potentially. Everything is just on a postage side stamp. That's right.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.460]  I mean, you know, in the future, the funny part is the new, I know we're gonna talk about
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.460]  the new iMacs, or the new iMacs, like they could just have a slot. You just pull it out
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.660]  and stick a new computer in. I know. You really could. It really is almost like, it really,
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:30.420]  I thought about that. It's, it's like, why, why get a new display when the M3 comes out
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.820]  in two years? Why not just have like a cartridge that just has the, you know, the computer
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.820]  on it?
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.900]  Swappable chin like a plastic surgery.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.580]  But I do get it. And I do, you know, having gone through, I've had AirPods for so long,
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:49.420]  and it was funny, I had to look it up recently. I think they came out in like 2015. It's surprisingly
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:54.700]  long to me for a thing that still seems new. One thing I'd looked, I was just upgrading
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:05:01.340]  my Apple Watch to the new OS. No, I forget what I was, I was checking to see if it, if
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.820]  it wanted to, because I've been using, I was using the beta versions of 14.5 for a long
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.500]  time so I could get the unlock with the watch while you're wearing a face mask. Which I'm
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.480]  glad I did, because it was a long beta cycle. I got like two months out of that. But I wound
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:22.140]  up poking around and looking at the battery. So I have a Series 5 Apple Watch. So I, you
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:29.260]  know, it'll be two years old in September, or maybe October was the time I bought it.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:37.140]  And according to the OS, it is not, it's the battery capacity is at 91%. Oh, wow. You know,
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:43.340]  isn't great, isn't bad. I mean, I wear it more more days often than not. You know, you
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.220]  know, I'm an idiot, and I bought the titanium version. So I don't know, what is that like
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.720]  six or 700 bucks? I mean, you know, I mean, like you get a $600 watch, you don't expect
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:57.340]  the battery to, you know, and I know I can just take it to Apple and I can throw it away
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:04.020]  if the battery gets unacceptable. Very sensitive with the watch compared to a laptop. But like,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.740]  you know, by the time it gets down to like 80%, maybe in another year, it's like, wouldn't
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:16.780]  I rather just buy a Series 8 Apple Watch two years from now? You know, there's it it's
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:22.880]  not plan not planned obsolescence is the wrong term, like because it planned obsolescence
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.460]  really sounds like you truly went to your engineers and said, I want you to design a
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.640]  toaster that after 600 time, 600 slices of toast, the spring will break, and then they
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:39.460]  have to buy a new toaster. Like that's that it it's largely about the fact that by you
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:45.380]  know, Apple stuff lasts long enough that by the time it really does wear out or is unusable.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:50.780]  The new stuff is so compelling that it really does make more sense to just get a new phone.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:55.100]  Yeah. And, and this is I think, the big difference that with Apple gear than with the things
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.980]  made by most other companies, like who wants an Android three phone or an Android six phone
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:05.180]  or something, right? Those do not have a lot. I mean, they do. I mean, they're using the
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.480]  developing world or some aftermarket. But I think those are more disposable. And I know
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:14.620]  people are walking around with like iPhone fours and fives, right? Those are still functional.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:19.900]  And, you know, whenever I've sold, I don't think I've so rarely had a computer die, actually,
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.820]  when I got a MacBook Air last spring thinking foolishly, well, Apple won't release two MacBook
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.620]  Air models in one year, especially during a pandemic, right? So I bought a new Intel
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.740]  one, right when they came up with the better keyboard version. And my 2015 MacBook, which
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:38.140]  had had, you know, five years under Apple care plus how to get the keyboard, the bottom
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.940]  case, the battery replaced, I think at one point, but totally, you know, cover, so it
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:46.220]  was worth having bought the Apple care plus, that one was dying in such a weird way that
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:51.140]  I took the buyout and I, you know, got 300 bucks for it from Apple as a trade in and
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.060]  let them disassemble it and do whatever, right. But that's one of the few times like, normally
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:00.580]  my partner is like, as like my one of my kids both got 2018 MacBook Airs. And so they're
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.480]  getting towards the end of their three years of Apple care plus and they're in good condition.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.420]  And we're probably gonna, you know, I think at least for one of them, they might get a
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:12.900]  M1 or whatever the subsequent model is. So I'm like, hey, what's your battery capacity?
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.860]  So install the battery monitor app that I really like third party tool. And it's like,
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:22.260]  oh, it's at like 79, 80%. Like, as soon as it's consistently under 80%, we are getting
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:26.140]  this battery replaced. Because when we sell it, I mean, it's a benefit for somebody who
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:30.160]  buys it, we can say, you know, A, we'll get a little better price for it. And B can say,
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.560]  this was just repaired warranty, it has 100% new refurbished battery. And there you go.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.000]  What's the name of the app? Because people are gonna ask, it is, I think it's literally
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.060]  called battery monitor to accept those substitutes. It's by but let me tell you the maker because
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:50.500]  I think if you go, you know, the usual app store problem, if you actually go into battery
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:55.120]  monitor and the app store, you will get, you know, too many different apps, it is by the
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.060]  fine people at they're telling me I can't run it on my computer because it's I'm on
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.900]  an iMac. So anyway, it's bad. It's the best battery monitor.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.700]  I will put it I promise I've already made a note I will put it in the show notes.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.180]  It's great. It's what I was using. I was testing a lot of USB battery packs and draining batteries
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:20.820]  and doing stuff and I am just a big. It's a big fan of this simple app because it just
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:24.420]  pulls out all the stuff you can get some of it from system information. But not all of
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.640]  it. Some of it you have to actually use this app in order to see like you can get cycles
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:36.180]  but you can't get percentage of capacity from Oh, Marcel Bracink software.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:43.300]  Well, anyway, I feel like we will look back long, you know, hopefully sooner rather than
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:48.600]  later. I mean, 10 years, you know, 10 years feels like a decent goal that we'll look back
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:57.700]  on this era of glued in batteries and the the lifespan, the usable lifespan they had
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:02.100]  and think of it as incredibly crude. Oh, that's a great way to think about it. Yeah, but it's
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.500]  you know, there's a lot of the stuff though that people think you know, like I don't know
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.100]  the individual AirPods themselves. I don't know. I've seen what they look like when they're
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:16.400]  taken apart and it's really hard to to argue against the design. I don't know. I wish that
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.980]  they were more repairable. It seems incredibly wasteful that the best thing to do with $160
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:27.100]  pair of wireless headphones that just doesn't hold a charge anymore is get new ones. Well,
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:32.220]  you know, there's those those women who started the company that does AirPod battery replacement,
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:37.660]  right? They have some kind of secret thing they do. It's Jeff Carlson wrote about this
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:44.100]  for tidbits. Oh, I'm blanking out of the product name. It's a it's a they have some kind of
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:49.380]  clearly robotic system for replacing the batteries. So they take the glue out and whatever, and
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:55.500]  they don't charge that much for it relative to the cost of the AirPod. Pod swap is the
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.780]  name of these folks pod swap you send them and they're what they're clever at 60 bucks
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.820]  for a swap of the first generation ones currently sold out in the second you send them yours
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:09.700]  in and they send you a refurbished pair basically. They swap them out and then they deal with
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:17.060]  the with the issue of of, you know, cleaning and doing it but they have some secret sauce
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:20.960]  they've invented. It doesn't sound like it cannot be manual because it's too you know,
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.580]  one's been able to forget a manual process and anyway, it's a it's a clever idea. They
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.580]  can do it Apple could do it.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:32.100]  I will. All right. I agree with that. And I will put this in the show notes. But just
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:39.740]  looking at the math, right? $160 pair of headphones and 60 bucks to swap the battery. Again, that
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.540]  is a better deal than buying a new pair of $160 headphones, right? No doubt about it.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.980]  But it's still that's like a third of the price. Like back when we were kids, if you
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:54.620]  had bought a $40 calculator, if you had found out it costs $15 to replace the battery, you
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:57.900]  would thought it was crazy, right? I mean, that doesn't it?
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:02.540]  Oh, yeah, it's a great tea. I mean, that's the thing is our problem is we're comparing.
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.900]  Yeah, it's, I mean, remember when we use Macs and they would essentially like or any computer
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.740]  and they like burn out within two or three years, like they just die, something would
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:15.120]  go wrong with them. And sometimes you replace a component, but often they were too slow
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.540]  at that point or whatever. And you just have this, you know, off with the towers, you'd
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.380]  wind up with if you didn't take, there's no computer recycling. So you didn't figure out
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.100]  where to get rid of them. You have like 10, you remember this, right? You'd like 10 towers
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:30.300]  in the corner for your last 10 years. So now, like my expectations when I buy a Mac, it's
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.620]  going to last me five to seven years unless I have a specific reason to update. Like I
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:40.300]  need to write about new technology. So my five year old Mac book, which I liked, was
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.220]  dying. It was doing weird stuff and I needed to write about, you know, I need a new machine
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:48.140]  that I need to write about the M1. But many of the machines that I've then sold because
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.940]  they weren't dying, people have gone on, they've told me, oh, I'm still using that thing from
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:56.820]  three years ago. So they get eight or 10 years out of a Mac with the nominal repair in the
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.380]  meantime, maybe the battery swapped or some component. So that is fantastic by the standards
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:06.380]  of our youth. Absolutely. But the thing is we hold everybody to higher standards now.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.980]  And so we hold Apple to the standard of like, well, couldn't it be even longer?
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.780]  We just need some kind of next generation push on batteries, something that's as revolutionary
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:20.900]  as totally right. As lithium ion was to everything that came before it. It's all coming. I hadn't
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.740]  thought about that. Like the 10 year timeframe on batteries is not going to be, well, we
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.620]  have 20% more efficiency out of lithium ion. That is not going to be what it is. But like,
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.420]  for example, just to name one, you know, and we'll get into the Apple remote in a bit,
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:35.860]  but I'm much happier with the Apple remote having a little lightning port in the back
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:41.620]  than if I had to find a CR 2032 battery every single time it ran out. You know, it's true.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:45.740]  I have to charge my Apple remote. Like every, uh, it really is the most delightful thing.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:49.260]  It's like TV tells you, Hey, the battery's getting low, but it's like, you know, like
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.780]  10%. So you could easily, if you just don't want to deal with it right now, you could
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:56.500]  just keep watching the movie. But if you do want to charge it up, you just need like 10
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.860]  minutes on like a charger you have laying around. Anyway, let me take a break here and
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.780]  thank our next sponsor. Oh, you know what? I take it back about, yes, please. This is
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:11.200]  a near and dear sponsor to my heart. It's the only sponsor and daring or in talk show
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.500]  history who has ever written the theme song for this podcast that doesn't actually have
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:22.100]  a theme song. Alex Weinstein. Look, we're all storytellers. The game you're developing
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:26.900]  is a, is it a peaceful meditation or an exhilarating rush? The commercial you're directing? Is it
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:33.300]  an inspiring and heroic type thing or is it strange and curious? The podcast you're editing,
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:38.740]  is it banter between friends or is it serious in depth reporting on like a real life mystery
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:46.140]  in every project? It's music that tells the story. It's music that creates emotion. Where
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:53.460]  do you go for music? Well, I'm sure you have some sort of go to stock music site, but stock
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.660]  sites think more is better. They tout how many hundreds of thousands of songs they have
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.740]  in their catalogs. It's like listening for a needle in a haystack and it's a very boring
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:11.300]  haystack. Why don't you try something new? I want to tell you about Alex Weinstein music.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:16.500]  This is a direct line to a composer whose music has been licensed by Google, Amazon,
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:23.780]  Intel, Slack, panic and more. And he did the pick and boogers with John theme song for
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:34.660]  the show. You are listening to his music right now while I do this read. Alex's style is
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:41.100]  different than most. He takes a human approach to music production. Sounds can be imperfect.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:47.600]  Rhythms can live off the grid. It's handmade and organic music with exciting rhythms and
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:54.940]  texture and genuine real personality style. The result is a unique sound that helps your
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:59.420]  story stand out and connect with your audience. Do you want to tell a better story? Start

[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.660]  actually sounded like. I'm imagining it in my head right now, but I'm going to go, I'm
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:40.620]  going to go find it. I'm going to go listen to the show. Listen to myself. Where's that
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:46.620]  work? All right. Speaking of Apple TV remotes, there's a new Apple TV remote. You know my
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:53.320]  friend Joe Rosenstiel, right? Yeah. Joe is written the most eloquent. I'm not sure anyone
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:59.860]  has written as beautifully as at length about his, the hatred for the, uh, the old Siri
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:05.420]  remote as he has. And I recommend searching for Joe Rosenstiel and Siri remote if you
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.780]  want to understand everything that there is. Um, and I saw this as like, thank God I just
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:16.380]  bought the function one Oh one remote last year, which is very much like the new, it's
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:20.020]  got a lot of things in common, but not entirely, uh, to this new Siri remote, but it was kind
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.620]  of like, Oh, thank God. All right. But why, you know, when you hit yourself in the head
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:28.100]  for long enough, it starts to feel good. John talk about, and that's another one. I think
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.900]  that, I think that this, the, the, the black Siri remote came out in 2015 with the, what
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:42.420]  they call the Apple TV HD six years with that guy. Oh my God. I can't tell you. I, to me
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:47.900]  still the biggest head scratcher in my entire career writing about Apple. It's not the most
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:52.820]  important thing by far. It's not my biggest complaint, not my most serious complaint because
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:57.100]  it's relatively low stakes. What do we, what are we complaining about? That, uh, the, the,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.140]  the track pad diving board end of it, it, you touch it wrong and all of a sudden you
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.140]  pause the movie and all you wanted to do was pick up the damn remote to adjust the volume
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:10.260]  and you've paused, maybe you clicked or something and it went back. But you know, worst case
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.940]  scenario, I don't know, your, your family members are mad at you for doing it or, you
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.700]  know, but you're 10 seconds away from getting back to where you were. It's not destructive,
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:24.060]  but it's just so baffling. When did Apple make anything awkward? When did Apple make
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:30.540]  anything awkward besides the pencil and the four dimension mouse charging, right? Those
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.300]  are the two most awkward things that Apple ever did and they're just when you're charging,
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:39.740]  right? I don't know. It's not a bad idea. I could certainly see how it was like, let's
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:45.420]  make it, let's just prototype it and see how it is, you know, but if you actually prototype
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.020]  it in a real world living room where the lights are down, it is a disaster, you know, and
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:55.140]  in years and years and years, they just kept shipping this thing. There's no, they're making
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.580]  the best Macs they've ever made in history. They're making the best iPhones ever made
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.740]  in history. They're like, let's just keep shipping this pizza. The funniest, one of
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.580]  the funniest parts of the whole saga of that remote is that when they came out with the
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:14.100]  Apple TV 4k in 2018, they did tweak it. They put a white ring, a white ring around the
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.600]  menu button, which in addition to being white, if the lights are on, was actually raised
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.580]  so you could tell the menu button apart by touch. And I remember talking to somebody
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:31.720]  at Apple about, it was like, that's it? And it was like, well, I guess some people don't
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.820]  like the old remote, but you know, now we have a ring around the menu button and it's
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:42.520]  part of Ives's severance. You can never change this until after X years after I've left.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.980]  Do we blame this on Johnny Ive? Did Johnny Ive? No, no. The Siri remote had naked pictures
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:53.540]  of him and it was holding him hostage. I mean, is that whose fault it is? And now somebody
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:20:01.480]  liked it. You know, and Apple's always changing, right? You know, and maybe some, some designs
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:08.780]  like the aluminum, aluminum, unanodized MacBook air stayed the same for kind of an extraordinary
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.260]  long period of time. But for the most part, you know, every couple of years, everything
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:17.580]  gets a new look. I don't want to attribute everything, you know, oh, brightly colored
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:21.980]  IMAX, you know? Well, thank God Johnny Ive is gone. They fixed the remote. Thank God
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:27.740]  Johnny Ive is gone. No, no, no. It's just, but some of these, some of these things, it
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.580]  might be, I think it's, they didn't care. Nobody there cared as much as the people using
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.580]  it cared that they hated it. Is my suspicion. I don't know. There must be, they all used
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:40.780]  it. Don't you think all the Apple people, I know they always using their phone. Nope.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:47.340]  I know that they do. I know. I know that like Eddy Cue is a big time Apple TV user. I know
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.020]  Phil Schiller uses it. The Siri remote though, like if you're using your phone, if your phone
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.340]  is your remote, you don't have this experience. And so my question is, is everybody or all
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:00.460]  those people phone in the hand people, so they're watching TV and they don't even care.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.100]  They don't use it because it's not as, you know, it's not as sophisticated as the phone
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:07.820]  remote. And when I use the phone remote, I have my anger level at Apple TV goes down
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:15.140]  like 97%. So maybe that's it. See, you know what? I don't like using the phone remote.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:18.480]  Not because I think there's something wrong with it, but because when I'm watching TV,
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.180]  I want to get away from, you know, it's the end of my day and I want to be off the phone.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:28.240]  It's like, it'd be better if I just left my phone in the kitchen and didn't even have
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:32.340]  it in the living room with me. Cause I don't want to find out somebody posted to Slack
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:37.280]  or you know, breaking news from New York time. No, I'm watching something with my family,
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.660]  you know? So I don't, but maybe, maybe that's the explanation. I don't know. But we have
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:48.340]  a new remote that looks like it's looks nice. Looks nice. Goes on sale at 5 AM. So if you
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:52.940]  want one, I think it was. So you've gone, you've got up to 5 AM. It is funny. It is
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:59.940]  funny. Maybe. I don't know. I mean, so they fixed the remote and it looks like they fixed
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.860]  the remote and the, one of the problems with the Siri remote, the black one, the one that
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:09.460]  we hate is, in my opinion, people could just look at it and think, well, isn't that weird
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.820]  that it's symmetric? Aren't you going to be, you know, not knowing which end you've picked
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:16.420]  up. And it's like, yeah, yeah. The things that you thought just by glancing at it. So
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:22.020]  yeah, I'm not, I can't review the new Apple remote yet. I don't have it, but my review
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:28.180]  of the photograph of it is that it certainly looks like it's going to make me very happy.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.960]  The thing I'd love to talk about though, if I can dig into something is this color balance
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.940]  thing. So John, I know you worked, I know you worked in desktop publishing. Did you
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:43.020]  ever have to do color correction? Yes. But, but I typically never had to do it. Was there
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:47.860]  somebody else when I was at the Philadelphia Inquirer's promotions department, we had,
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:52.220]  the work I did was never so sensitive color-wise that I had to worry about it. So we did, but
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:59.540]  I also remember reading like Mac world coverage of, you know, this is the CRT era. Yeah. And
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.980]  the late, and the late great Bruce Fraser's incredible book on a, was it color correction?
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:08.740]  It was about color. You did a real world color. I don't know. It was a great book. I remember
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.100]  it was, it was so great. Graham Nash loved that book. Apparently a grammar Nash is huge
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:18.020]  nerd. He came very good friends with the Bruce Fraser before his death. Anyway, but no, so
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:22.260]  I was doing color correction back in the day. I did it under like one of those, the color
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.720]  balanced hoods. And this was for a, it was for a shop that was doing, it was like a typesetting
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.060]  and output shop imaging center place connected with the Kodak center for creative imaging
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:35.500]  where I used to work and are sort of connected with them anyway. So we have one of these,
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.620]  these hoods that you would go under and the lights were perfect and whatever. And I was
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.620]  like, one day I'm like, Oh, this is funny. And I realized I had like a five degree color
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:48.460]  red difference between my two eyes. Like that's how much correction I was doing and how calibrated
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:54.500]  the environment was like, well, my eyes perceive red. So anyway, you know, so I've been working,
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.660]  you know, color correction is this magical art. It's not calibration. I realize those
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:00.300]  are two different things, but you're always trying to figure out like, how do you get
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:04.300]  the thing that's the original thing? And this is one of those aspects of like, when you
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:09.980]  produce a television there's a broadcast quality thing. You know, there's all these parameters
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:15.200]  around the kind of video. And one of the remarkable things about HD video and sort of modern production
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.100]  is that you can have a handheld device, like a phone that can actually produce something
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.460]  that meets broadcast qualities with, you know, the post-production part. So this is all really
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:28.980]  cool, but you're like, all right, how do I get, how do I not have to sit there and tweak
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:33.620]  the million things, right? I just got a new TV. We went from a 32-inch to a 40-inch or
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:37.620]  whatever we have now. We got the biggest thing that fits. We decided to go from 1080p to
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:42.280]  4K because we're watching more TV. And I'm like doing the calibration stuff and the controls
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.860]  are really poor. It's a Vizio. It's okay. And I think I've got it okay, but I'm not
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:51.620]  delighted. And then this comes out, I'm like, oh, can I have to buy an Apple TV? I don't
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:56.120]  have a 4K. I have the HD one. Am I going to have to buy a 4K? Because this is incredible.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:02.380]  It's like one of the greatest uses of technology is a thing that makes your life easier in
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:08.760]  a noticeable way that makes you happier, right? It makes you feel better. It's not life-saving,
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:13.700]  but it's just a brilliant idea. Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm going on and on about it.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:17.140]  You know, you don't have to get a new Apple TV for it. You know, it's just built into
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.140]  tvOS.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:24.300]  No, I did not. Oh my, I'm an idiot. John, excuse me. I got to go calibrate my TV. I
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:30.480]  didn't know that. I didn't know that. All right. But yet I just got 14, I got 14.5 yesterday.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.940]  So I didn't have the, it wasn't ready for yet. Yeah. Same here. I manually forced it
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:40.900]  to update yesterday and I haven't used it since. So I have not done my homework. I feel
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:46.580]  like color correction, whatever you want to call the whole scheme, getting your display
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:52.220]  to show color well is one of those little things that has gotten so much better over
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:57.940]  like you're in my lifetime. Like number one, CRTs were terrible. I mean, they were what
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:03.740]  we had, but in hindsight, it's like, Oh my God, no wonder my eyes are so bad. But they
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:09.100]  were also terribly inconsistent. They were easily, they had like dials. They had actual
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:14.340]  physical dials under the screen that somebody could screw with, you know, and then you'd
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:20.060]  be like, Oh, why did you do that? Where were these before? Yeah. There are no presets,
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:27.260]  right? How about the whole thing with Mac versus windows standard gamma? Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:32.740]  Right. And then remember that. And then you'd have like a monitor that was going on the
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:38.060]  Fritz and you could like re recalibrated in the control, the monitors control panel, and
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:44.860]  you'd get like another custom thing. And it was, it was so, it was a disaster and that's
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:49.300]  not even going to professional standards that was just trying to get it. So it looked right
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:55.220]  to your eyes as somebody who cared about color and now that they just work. Oh, but not your
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:59.300]  TV. Right. And so, you know, right. So like your iPhone, you never have to worry about
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.940]  like what gamma your, your iPhone is generating or whatever. You just do brightness, right?
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:08.580]  All you have to worry about is brightness. Do you want to turn true tone on these things
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.340]  that you can easily understand? And they're not really about calibration, but are about
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:16.420]  personal taste. Oh, in the, in the P3 color space. I mean, when Apple started talking
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.980]  about that and I was like, well, most people notice, I don't know, it'll have some more
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:26.380]  vivid colors in a few areas. And it's, you know, if you use a RGB or was it SRGB versus
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:30.660]  P3 phone, you look at them side by side and the SRGB thing looks like washed out crap
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:35.400]  sometimes for the same photo. You're like, this is noticeable improvement that people,
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.420]  if you put them side by side, a normal person would say that one's better with the P3. But
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.860]  anyway, this new feed, that calibration thing is supposed to work. You know, we'll have
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.820]  to, we'll have to try it afterwards. Well, why can't I do this on my Mac? John, why can't
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.500]  I do this on my Mac? You're not supposed to. It's calibrating already, right? See, that's
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.800]  just it. You're not supposed to need to, you're supposed to plug it into an Apple display
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:02.120]  or a built-in display, but, uh, and otherwise the other big thing with Apple TV is, is sort
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.140]  of, as I wrote about it, it's like a lot of speculation that Apple was like getting out
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.660]  of the market because that's why they're pushing the TV plus app onto all these other platforms.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.320]  And they're just going to, you know, be more like Netflix instead of worrying about selling
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:20.500]  Apple TV boxes, they just want to put Apple TV on everybody else's boxes. Other people
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.460]  who thought, well, no, they should sell their own box, but they've got to compete on price.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:30.360]  These Roku things are only 40 bucks and Amazon is only 40 bucks. They need something for
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.660]  under a hundred dollars. And Apple was like, Nope, we're good. We'll, we'll just keep selling
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:43.500]  these for $180 because we can have a 32 gigabyte upgrade first 32 gigabytes. You probably don't
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.540]  need and that they didn't even bother. They didn't even bother telling you what you could
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.300]  use it for. The only thing I can imagine would be if you really do use your Apple TV as a
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:58.460]  gaming console, they're there having the games installed could take up multiple gigabytes,
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:03.060]  but like for streaming video, you don't certainly don't need extra 32 gigabytes, but on the
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:08.740]  other hand, it's only 20 bucks. So it's like, if you're already in for 179, why not? I don't
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.740]  know.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:13.580]  You know, the secret too is, um, I don't know if anybody put me enables this, uh, content
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.500]  caching on your Mac. If you've got a desktop Mac and you've got a bunch of extra storage,
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:22.460]  like I've got an eight terabyte external hard drive that I use for like offloading stuff
[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:29.340]  and backups and, and whatever, um, Mac OS, you go to sharing preference pane, you check
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:35.100]  the content caching box, and then you can set a limit and point it to a drive and any
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:40.660]  Apple content like it's synced appointments, uh, stuff protected with fair play, whatever
[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:45.700]  is just cash there for the network, uh, system updates, iOS updates, whatever. And so you
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.140]  don't know what's in there. Apple does all this disguising and encryption, but it's basically,
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:56.140]  I've got like an Apple content distribution network node on my drive. I can't, I can't
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:01.420]  even tell if it works. Like it's, it's constantly downloading stuff and it's full of, it's got
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:06.860]  like 20 gigabytes of stuff on it or whatever. I can't remember what I devoted to it, but
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:10.980]  it's like when you, if you've watched a movie, uh, you know, from a streaming device, it
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.460]  doesn't necessarily download it to the device. It'll download it to the caching server. So
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:18.620]  when you stream, it doesn't come off the network off the internet. We have gigabit internet,
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:22.580]  so that's fine, but it comes from your, you know, your local network anyway. So that's
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:24.900]  a trick you can do if you have a lower speed network.
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:31.180]  And that's in settings sharing. It's in, uh, uh, no, in the Mac OS, so a system preferences
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:35.340]  sharing, it's just one of these options. And if you look up details about it, Apple has
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:39.220]  some stuff online, but it's kind of like, turn this on and we'll cash some stuff on
[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:43.420]  your machine, like all kinds of things. And, uh, you know, so if you've got a lower speed
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:46.980]  connection, you've got like a 10 or 20 megabit per second connection. Back when Apple was
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:53.260]  making, uh, wifi routers, the time capsule had a feature like that where the, you know,
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:57.660]  your, your, your, if you're, if I forget if it was just the time capsule, because that
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:02.700]  time capsule probably, because it's the only one with storage, right? Like a regular cash.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:08.540]  Yeah. Cause I mean, I've always thought, I think that Apple, I wish for $179 I wish the
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:13.300]  new Apple TV was also a wifi hub. I mean, it's already a home kit hub and it could be
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:20.420]  a content caching hub and it could be so much more. And instead it is to me a little bit
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:25.460]  surprising that they did the very least surprising thing possible and just sort of upgrade the
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:30.780]  a series chip to the a 12 kept the prices the same and said, no, no, we're good. And,
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:39.980]  and you know, it seems like their attitude is yes, we want TV app everywhere. And so
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.740]  we're doing that. And anybody who's, who thinks that's fine. And at a $40 Roku box or the
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:51.460]  built-in smart TV stuff on your TV, if that's good for you, then Apple TV will be there
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:59.580]  for you. And if you want a premium experience and you know, color corrected output and the,
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:06.660]  the Dolby Atmos sound to their home pods and the Dolby, whatever they call it for the HDR
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.500]  content, you, you know, if you're willing to pay 180 bucks, you can, you can have a
[01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:16.420]  premium experience with the Apple TV box. It is sort of a very old school Apple idea.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:20.700]  You know, it's sort of like where the Mac was 20 years ago, you know, where, yeah, it
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:25.980]  is a serious premium over a PC crap box, but some people are willing to pay for it. And,
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:31.300]  you know, five, five, 6% of the market is fine for the, for them, for this product,
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:35.900]  you know, this isn't supposed to set the world on fire. Have you used a smart TV with the
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:42.140]  Apple TV app on it? Because I had not until recently. I did when we got a new TV a year
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:50.300]  ago and how long did you use it? Like 30 seconds. We got our new Vizio and it's a relatively
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:54.580]  modern, you know, 4k, it's not super high on one. It's like very affordable model. And
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:58.700]  I was like, well, this is great. It's got all the apps and I've got an HD Apple TV.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:04.060]  So we can watch 4k Apple TV programming through the app, the Apple TV app on the Vizio. And
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:07.340]  I don't know, I lasted, I don't know, maybe a couple of days messing with it. And it's
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:12.180]  so slow and the interface is terrible and everything lags and to go back and forth between
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:18.020]  Apple TV app on the Vizio and Apple TV on its own hardware, you know, the last, like
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:22.180]  a fourth generation one, not a, not a fifth or later, it was the most painful thing in
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.180]  the world. I'm like, all right, this is why they can charge. Right. This is why I haven't
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:30.160]  used a Roku. And so I realized Roku is a totally different experience and they're very affordable
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:33.420]  and so forth. So that's not a fair comparison, but it was embarrassing.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:38.280]  Yeah, I bought, uh, I didn't, I wound up not really writing about it at length, but I bought
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:44.740]  a Roku and an app, an Amazon box like two years ago, just, you know, and each one was
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:48.340]  like 80 bucks and I thought, well, I can justify it cause I'll write about it, but I didn't
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:52.820]  write about it, but I tried them both and they're fine. They're, they're, they're better
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:58.340]  in my opinion, in my opinion, then it, to me, it's like three tiers. There's the built
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:03.420]  into the TV tier, which is not good. I, we have an LG and people often say, if you read
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:09.020]  the reviews, people who actually bother to try Samsung and Sony and LG and Vizio and
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:14.140]  whoever else that LG does have the best reputation for the built-in software. And it's actually,
[01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:22.620]  it's like the, the remnants of the old Palm OS, right? It's or web OS from Palm. Like
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:30.100]  LG was the company that wound up buying the rights to, to the Palm web OS and they either
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:34.660]  never used it for phones or quickly aborted it for phones. But, uh, but that's what they've
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:39.380]  gotten their TVs and it is better than, than most of the other ones I've seen, like at
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:44.740]  family members' houses and stuff like that. That's not good. The Roku and the fire box
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:49.660]  or fire TV box, whatever Amazon calls it are better. Roku's in my opinion, better than
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:55.580]  Amazon. Amazon is just so clumsy software wise, everything, even their store. To me,
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:00.660]  it's their Achilles heel is that their design is so bad. Like we were just, I forget what
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.460]  we were watching at our family. We just watched something on Amazon prime, but it's like even
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:11.340]  my son who doesn't typically nerd out on stuff like this, he was like, this app is so janky.
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:18.700]  It just, it looks like the Amazon prime app looks like, like a prototype, you know, like
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:23.620]  us, like a couple of engineers who weren't even working with the designer, put this together.
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.340]  Cause everything is just like a rectangle and a box and all right, we can just put an
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:31.820]  image here and put some texts here. And it's like, you know, then you go show your boss,
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:35.540]  like, look, we could make this app that shows all this video. And it's like, yeah, let's
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:41.840]  green light. Let's bring a designer on board, get an interaction team. You know, like nothing
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.460]  is animated. It's, it's so weird. It very crude. The Roku is much better in that regard,
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:54.380]  but it's also clearly like a step behind the Apple TV, like just a night and day to me.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:36:00.060]  So it's worth it to me, 180 bucks. I don't know. I don't need to buy a new Apple TV 4k.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.940]  So I, you know, I've, I've had mine since the 4k one came out in 2018, so I've still
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:09.800]  got years ahead of it. So for the 180 bucks I spent on it, it's, you know, it's not bad,
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:13.920]  but it is interesting to me that it's contrary to everybody's advice. I don't remember anybody's
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:20.620]  advice to Apple being what they should do with the Apple TV is change nothing. Just
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:24.960]  keep selling these boxes for $180.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.620]  They're so, I mean, they are so funny because they don't have to, you know, they, they don't
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:33.740]  want to Apple as I think you've pointed out, many people pointed out, uh, they figure out
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.160]  a price point and then that's the price point for that product. Not forever, but often it
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:41.940]  doesn't move very much. Right. And they don't need to. And then occasionally, you know,
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:45.340]  we've seen them do it with like the home pod and some other products where they're like,
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:48.660]  ah, maybe this is a little much and they, they tweak it or they produce a new thing
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:52.460]  and then they have a justification to make it lower. They try to keep the lowest price
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.460]  of the lowest and Mac at a, you know, under a thousand dollars, those kinds of things.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:01.620]  But I think they like their prices more than they like adjusting prices. They don't want
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:05.500]  to, I mean, they're never racing to the bottom, but I think, you know, how do you have a company
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:11.700]  that's worth trillions of dollars and has delivers 30% plus margins consistently. That's
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:17.140]  how you don't change the price. I would say the product where that was the most conspicuous
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:24.940]  for the most people was the Mac book air and that that era when it was not still $999 did
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:31.660]  not have a retina screen and it was just looking slower and slower, slower, and they just were
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:37.700]  waiting until they could make the retina Mac book air that they wanted to make. And in
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.620]  the meantime, what every other PC maker would have done is low, well, we'll at least lower
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:47.740]  the prices, you know, but they, I, you know, I think, I think based, I mean, again, they'll
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:52.560]  never explain themselves, but basically they didn't want to, okay, we're not ready with
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:57.460]  the next generation Mac book area, but we'll lower the price to 799. Okay. You know, there
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:02.100]  you go. Or 699, you know, that was super cheap, wasn't it? They never did. They never lowered
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:07.240]  the price. It was always 9 99. They had like eight. No, they had like 8 99 for, for education,
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:10.100]  but they never lowered the price because they didn't want to come out with the one they
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:15.220]  always wanted to come out with and say, okay, now here it is. And it's 11 99, you know?
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:20.060]  And in fact, when they came out with the retina Mac book air at like 11 99, they still kept
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:26.880]  the old crummy one around at 9 99 just to hold that price point until like a year later
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.700]  when, okay, now we can sell last year's retina Mac book air for 9 99 and here's a speed bump
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:37.180]  version for 11 99, et cetera. And then the other one that really stands out, of course,
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:42.520]  the trashcan Mac pro where never even got an update, but yet they kept these incredibly
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:48.100]  professional prices, you know, $4,000 for this computer with at, you know, a seven year
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:54.360]  old chip. I mean, it was, it was crazy. It just is, but it was such a niche product.
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.140]  You know, it didn't, it didn't have the mass market, but it's all about holding those price
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.140]  points.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.780]  Yep. And it's like, again, I mean, there are spreadsheets make it work. I mean, it's cracked
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:08.540]  me up that I bought a TV. I bought a 4k TV for just a few dollars more than the new Apple
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:13.600]  4k TV 4k. Right. It's like, that's, that's what they can do. And they own that. And,
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.720]  and you know what, I will probably eventually get one because I got a 4k TV now and an HD
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:22.420]  Apple TV. So I probably will eventually go, oh, you know, wait for sale or some, you know,
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.660]  whatever. And then I'll do it.
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:29.020]  My advice to anybody buying a TV is you research the hell out of it. There's only a nice thing
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:33.180]  is there's only a few brands. It's not as complicated as you would think there's what
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:40.620]  Sony Visio. Visio is not a Sony brand, right? It's Visio, Samsung and Sony and LG and LG.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:45.380]  Right. And, and you know, did you, did you get OLED or no? I did not. Now we got, we
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:49.780]  got a cheap thing and actually it's really, I was shocked by the reviews were really positive
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:55.780]  and I swear to God, we didn't pay more than $250 for it. So I it's, it's really good.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:40:01.420]  I, um, I went right, I skipped the whole led. I never owned an LED TV. So I went right from
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:07.820]  plasma to OLED, but by going, waiting, holding out for OLED, there were only four brands.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:11.980]  There's only four brands that make OLED. I chose LG cause it just seemed, it was a good
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:15.900]  combination and I liked the idea that the software was at least, if I ever had to use
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:23.600]  it, it was better. And then immediately stop looking at TV prices because TV prices, like
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.140]  if you wait three months, you'll save all this money or for the same amount of money,
[01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:34.380]  get a way bigger TV or way brighter TV. Like the TV market continues. It's amazing. It's
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:40.100]  really, you know, but it's, it's not something about, it's not something you want to keep
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:44.800]  your eye on the prices after you've made the decision. It's just a very, by the way is
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:51.020]  I think TV makers barely make any money like companies, you know, it used to be more and
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:55.180]  the race to the bottom was so quick and there's so few companies that can make like manufacture
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:59.980]  the glass and the led components. So, you know, Samsung famously provides chunks of
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:04.200]  that to Apple, right? And then Apple is building its own factories too, or, or buying or supporting
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.900]  ones to avoid having to use Samsung as as much of a source and blah, blah, blah. But
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:14.100]  the thing is it's really, the TV business is so terrible that, um, or the HDTV business
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:19.780]  that it's, I don't know if I, I remember a few years ago, practically no one except Samsung
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:24.740]  was making money because everyone else had to buy source materials from elsewhere. And
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:28.580]  I don't know what it is today, but anyway, so they charge these ridiculously low prices
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:33.500]  that are sometimes below their, you know, their profit. You're like, how do you, I don't
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:36.580]  understand a market like that. It's like the negative Apple model. It's like, let's have
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:41.060]  a negative 5% margin on all our products. All right, let me take a break here. Thank
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:46.060]  our next sponsor. Oh, all right. I keep talking up. Each sponsor is being better than theirs,
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:51.660]  but if you need, if you have this sponsor and you need them, you, they will become your
[01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:56.340]  favorite company ever. And I'm talking about back blaze, longtime sponsor. They're back

[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:19.300]  the one. It backs up everything you've got connected to the Mac. It's all in the cloud.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:23.540]  They have over an exabyte. I don't even know how much that is of customer data backed up
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:30.900]  and counting. Oh, they're telling me how much it is. That's 1 billion gigabytes, 50 billion
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:37.260]  over 50 billion files have been restored for back blaze customers. What do you do if you
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:40.260]  need to get stuff back? Well, number one, how do you get set up? You just install their
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:45.740]  software on your Mac, sign in, you get a 30 day free trial. It just starts backing stuff

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.100]  computer. It doesn't slow down your memory. Let it go. You might need to give it a couple
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:57.060]  of days cause you might have a lot of stuff. Then after that, everything just backs up
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:00.860]  incrementally. You don't even know it's there. There's just, there's nothing to do. You don't
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:04.500]  have to remember to go in every day and hit a button or something like that. No, it just
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:11.060]  backs up incrementally as you go to the cloud. They've got an iPhone app, Android app too,
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:14.740]  where you can go and access your files. So if you just want to access a file from your
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:18.700]  Mac while you're on your phone, just go to their app. There it is. You could just get
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:22.100]  it there and view it or email it to somebody or something like that. But when you want

[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:41.540]  They'll send it on a hard drive. You can send a hard drive back to them after you've restored
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:47.740]  it to your computer and get the money back for that. You can restore online, over the
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:52.020]  web, anywhere from the world, from anybody else's computer. If you need to access some

[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:30.260]  don't use backplace use something but backplace it I use it. I have it installed. I love it.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.780]  My thanks to backplace for sponsoring the show.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:41.340]  My wife's 2014 max SSD just entirely died. And we were able to achieve all our files
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:45.540]  300 gigabytes off backplace. Thank you. Not I'm not sponsored by backplace.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:50.060]  I didn't know that story. But it's great. Miller stories over the years. I I would I
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:55.060]  honestly hope and that backplace will not even discourage me from saying I hope none
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:59.820]  of you ever need it. I really do. I hope every single one of you never needs to use it. But
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:03.420]  if you do, that's when I get email from people and they're like, you know, I signed up for
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:07.060]  this a couple years ago on your podcast. And you'll never guess what happened to me last
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:12.180]  week. One million chance doc. One million chance. What else we got? Are we moving on
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:22.420]  to IMAX? IMAX. What do you think? I love the colors. I love the design. I guess the biggest
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:29.060]  complaint is why make it so absurdly thin? Because they can. I mean, that's this is kind
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:33.620]  of the Apple thing, right? It's they just are. They're obsessed by it. Because there's
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:38.500]  no, you know, I've got like I say, I've got the 2017 one and it's, it's curved. It's a
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:42.940]  little bit it's a little heavy still. So making it lighter would be good. But there's something
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:48.180]  about I don't know. Like they want this, you know, when the iPad came out, and it was like,
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:51.700]  it was a sheet of glass, and they'd remove the computer and you were completely interacting
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:56.300]  with the thing. Almost as if it didn't exist. You're directly sticking your hands into the
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:01.420]  computing experience of the device. So I feel like there's a little bit of the we're going
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:06.620]  to erase the computer until it no longer exists practically to produce an experience that
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:10.380]  you are not separate from the computer. And maybe that's the guiding philosophy. I don't
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:16.420]  know. I like the colors, though. I do like if they didn't have an institutional compulsion
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:21.540]  to keep making things ever smaller and make the computer disappear. If they didn't have
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:27.300]  it, I mean, yes, can it lead them to go too far? Sure, I would say I, you know, I would
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:33.960]  say the one port 12 inch MacBook is the best example that one port one USB port that also
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.460]  doubled as the power connector is not enough. It just isn't for any of those. Yeah, I had
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:43.100]  that machine. I own the 2015 MacBook, and it was incredibly irritating. Two ports is
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:48.660]  is fine. But one was ridiculous. John, let me ask you a contrasting question. Maybe this
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.740]  is the way Apple thinks about it. And maybe I'm wrong is, does it need to be any thicker?
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:47:01.220]  Maybe, you know, like, like, this is the both incredibly thin. But But I want to I wonder,
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:04.260]  did they actually strive for it? They're like, well, we got a monitor, like, well, where
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:07.740]  do we stick the computer in the past, we stuck the computer, sort of behind the monitor,
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.180]  you know, if you take apart your old net, the bulge, right, you kind of right bulged
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:15.020]  out like a CRT. And that was an LCD. And now they're like, we got the chin, and we're gonna
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:18.380]  get rid of the chin. It's like, no, we sort of need the chin, people put their hands on
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:22.420]  it, the height of the thing, we didn't give you an adjustable height. So unless you use
[01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:27.220]  a VESA mount version, you know, you kind of need that extra screen shouldn't be that low.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:31.460]  So let's just stick the whole computer in the chin, you know, and eventually I'm like,
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:34.500]  you know, and they put this is the fun part where they put the Ethernet port on the models
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:38.700]  that have gigabit Ethernet is in the power adapter, right, which is neat and weird. Eventually,
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.100]  I'm gonna be like, oh, they're just gonna put the entire computer in the power adapter.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:47.460]  Like that's the next evolution of the iMac is gonna be a little Mac mini sized lump on
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:51.820]  the floor, or a little Apple TV size thing, right? It's almost like with the it's almost
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:56.540]  like, is the Apple TV too big? You know, like, why does it need all those ports? Why can't
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:02.780]  it be more like Apple TV? No, I I'm with you, you know, and it is interesting, because part
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.580]  of making it so small is it does have an external power adapter now, which I believe is the
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:14.540]  first desktop Mac ever with a power external power connector. I mean, like, ever, ever.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.940]  I'm trying to think if, yeah, and I would say people were were had different opinions
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:25.580]  about it. I will tell you this, I'm confident with my extensive but limited knowledge of
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:30.460]  computer circuitry that I believe is probably you may exceed me on this, but it's certainly
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:35.660]  uncomfortable to you, because I'm not an electronics person, but I have read and talked to and
[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:41.520]  dug into it. I am absolutely confident the failure rate of the main device will be substantially
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.660]  lower by removing the power circuitry from it. Yeah, sticking it into the power brick
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:50.260]  because then you're like, my machine died. They're like, great, we will send you a new
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:56.620]  $50 item instead of having to repair a $1400 item. I wonder I wonder how often that that's
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:01.660]  what you know, something in that what fails SSC SSDs don't fail more. I mean, you know,
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:07.300]  over period of time, the main circuitry don't fail. The heat dissipation is an issue from
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:12.860]  the power supply more than the low power circuitry. This is an M1 based device. So the power dissipation
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.780]  is like, you know, it's like nothing compared to the Intel chips, right? So you're gonna
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.860]  you know, you've got M1s, it's you touch the computer, and it's not hot. And if you're
[01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:25.780]  using my kids have these 2018 MacBook Airs, and one of my kids will be doing this game
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:30.060]  called GeoGaster that's super fun. It's just they plop you down a Google map, you have
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:34.020]  to find where you are on the planet. It's really neat. And he's just using Google street
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:38.340]  map and his machine is so hot, you can't touch it. Right. And that's so these Macs are going
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:44.740]  to be absolutely cool to the touch in in every circumstance, and just won't overheat and
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:50.160]  overheating and other related issues. I'm sure a huge part of the failure of devices
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.160]  for repair.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:58.780]  I love that it's too thin for an Ethernet jack. I mean, because I didn't even think
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:04.020]  about that. Right. And it's, it's so they had the headphone jack is on the side, because
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:09.740]  it's the headphone jack is too deep to go in the back with the USB ports. But an Ethernet
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.820]  port wouldn't fit either in the back because it's not deep enough. And it wouldn't fit
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:19.360]  on the side because it's not thick enough. And it is pretty funny thinking about like
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:25.340]  back in the day when Ethernet was the shiznit. Part of what made it so cool was that it was
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:30.940]  so much smaller of a port than everything else, you know, I mean, compared to like,
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.580]  display adapters and SCSI, for example, SCSI was, you know, like the size of a book.
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:40.060]  Oh, my God, I love that. That's so great. And so that's actually, I had not thought
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:45.700]  about that as USBC thing is that it's actually shallow. So it's not just small. I didn't
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:49.620]  think about that. So the circuitry in the back end is right goes out on either side.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.100]  Yeah, it's, it's really pretty interesting. I mean, and you know, but that's the company.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:57.160]  So the people who are complaining about the chin, that they wish that they'd gotten rid
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:02.340]  of the chin. Why not just make it the whole thing a little bit thicker than he could have
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:08.220]  put the computer behind the display and nobody sees how thick it is. I get it. I mean, that's
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:12.020]  certainly you know, but maybe you should start a computer company. I don't know. I think
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:17.100]  Apple's, like I said, compulsion to keep making things thinner and create the illusion
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:23.220]  that the computer itself is disappearing is making driving them towards that goal much faster
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:28.040]  than if they if, if institutionally Apple was more willing to say, Ah, we'll just put
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:30.300]  it in the back. Who cares? Nobody looks at the back.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:34.980]  That's right. They could have a big ugly bulge. Imagine if there was like a, like a square
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:41.700]  bulge in the back. So it was super thin, no chin in the bulge of the computer. So yeah,
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:47.460]  that's where I what makes me wonder with is here we are at the end of April. WWDC is in
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:53.940]  like five weeks. Where do we see the rest of the Apple lineup going? So they've they've
[01:51:53.940 --> 01:52:00.160]  with the with these IMAX, they've completed the consumer end of the game, unless they
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:06.060]  have new products, like if they were going to bring back a just plain MacBook that's
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:09.620]  even smaller than the MacBook Air, which I expect them. I don't know if they'll call
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:14.140]  it the air. I expect, though, that they will have future, they're going to bring back laptops
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:18.340]  that are smaller than what we now call the MacBook Air. But But right now, there are
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:24.580]  consumer max across the board, all the consumer Intel max have either been replaced by M ones
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:31.180]  or are available as an alternative, you can still buy the Intel 21 inch iMac, if you want,
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:36.060]  I have no idea why anyone would buy that. But it's there if you want it. It's the pro
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:43.300]  max that are left. And I'm just like looking at the calendar. Here's what I with the iMac,
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:47.980]  what I think they're going to do is so for example, with with if you want a 16 inch MacBook,
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:52.940]  your only option is the MacBook Pro. That's it. And yeah, and the 16 inch MacBook Pro
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:53:00.180]  start said like 2800 2400 I think we're but it's you know, it's a serious amount of money.
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:04.420]  It's more than most people spend on a laptop like and that's a base configuration. Most
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:07.780]  people are probably going to, you know, you're looking at probably most people who buy a
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:16.260]  16 inch MacBook Pro probably spend $3,000 easy. I think but that's it. That's your only
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:22.380]  option for a 16 inch MacBook. There is no there's never been a 16 or 15 inch, you know,
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:28.000]  1200 dollar MacBook. I think that's where they're going with the iMac is is that okay,
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.060]  so they've got this 24 inch display. It's much bigger, noticeably bigger than the old
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:38.420]  21 inch. But what about the people used to the 5k 27 inch? My guess is that there'll
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:44.380]  be the new iMac Pro will just be like the 16 inch MacBook Pro where it's just that's
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:49.700]  that's the big iMac. It's 27 inches, maybe it'll go up to 30 inches. I don't know. I
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:53.480]  speculated maybe they'd go to 30 some a couple people are like, I don't know about that.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:59.420]  Because 27 is exactly 5k. They're not going to make the pixels bigger. Who knows? Whatever
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:05.220]  2730 a bigger display. All of them are iMac Pros. They all have, you know, the ability
[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:10.740]  to have more than 16 gigabytes of RAM more than two terabytes of storage. But what chip
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:18.900]  is it? Is it the M one x? Is it? Is it dude, but and when you know, like, when is it coming
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.780]  out? If they announce him at June, but they don't ship till later in the summer or the
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:28.700]  fall, then does an M one x even make sense? Why come out with an M one x when the M twos
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:33.580]  are probably coming out later in the fall? Right? Like, yeah, I don't buy that. Well,
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:37.660]  I'll tell you, I'll tip my hand, which is, you know, among the many 1000s of books I
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.820]  feel like I've written, take control of your M series Mac is my book about M series Macs
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:46.580]  because Joe Kissel and I are like, we're not going to name this M one Mac because we don't
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:52.740]  know what Apple is going to do. And we figure I'm I'm on the favor of the M two M one x
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:56.660]  sounds like the thing they do for incremental change. I think for a pro machine, it's going
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.260]  to be called an M two because it's going to be a fundamentally different thing. So there
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:05.220]  might be an M one x that allows Oh, I don't know, like maybe a lot of 32 gigs of internal
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:09.060]  memory or something. But there's been some good discussion about, you know, when you
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:13.380]  start to get above a certain size with a system on a chip, like you cannot just you can't
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:19.340]  throw like a terabyte of RAM into a system on a chip. So an M two that allows so I mean,
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:24.780]  we can back this out, right? A pro system has to be able to have enormous amounts of
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.100]  of RAM and should be able to have like four terabytes or eight terabytes of, of storage,
[01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:33.680]  because that's a reasonable thing from an SSD. So if you do that, you have to re engineer
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.700]  the chip, which means it's a next generation thing. And the M two, almost certainly, I
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.620]  doubt they'll put it into configurations. I mean, I could be wrong, but it doesn't seem
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:47.600]  to be their approach. So the M two will support some kind of external memory configuration.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:54.240]  So you can use D RAM, and maybe it'll be user expandable, because of the sheer difference
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.700]  of size people want. But that logic to me makes a lot of sense. And an M one x, maybe
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:05.780]  in the fall, there'll be an M one x, that drives the next generation of chip for specific
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:10.140]  machines, you know, maybe the MacBook Air, you know, version two of it. But an M two,
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:13.100]  I think has to be the pro chip. And I mean, my logic could be totally wrong. But that
[01:56:13.100 --> 01:56:15.540]  doesn't seem the way Apple likes to do its labeling.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:21.620]  But then what what would be the next chip for next year's MacBook Air? If the M two
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.940]  is for pros? See, that doesn't add up to me.
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:26.500]  No, I mean, but it could be. I mean, that's it could be the M one x, I mean, it could
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.860]  be an M one x like before. Or we would then you just I mean, do you up cores in it? Like,
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:35.340]  I have a feeling there's a core and I mean, sort of this issue like cores. There's so
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:39.660]  much in the M one. And I realize it's not that different in some ways from what was
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:45.260]  in the in the A series, but but it's I mean, do you know how many cores do you need? And
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:49.760]  a pro needs more cores that we know that's going to be a new architecture, right? And
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.300]  what do they do to the, you know, they're already using the five nanometer process.
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:57.900]  They've already got, you know, the neural, like all the things that are already in there.
[01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:02.300]  What is the next generation for a MacBook Air, it's going to be tweaks, and I don't
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:04.980]  know what those are going to be. If they're not, you know, they maybe they'll be higher
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:10.020]  performance. Or maybe there'll be 16 and 32 gigabyte options on chip instead of eight
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:11.020]  and 16.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:18.580]  Yeah, it's so the other way to look at Apple's in house chips, Apple Silicon, Mac, iOS and
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:23.300]  Mac, is to go by the actual cores, and they come out with new names for these cores every
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:29.740]  year. So back in a couple years ago, when they had the a 12, they called the high performance
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:36.220]  cores vortex, and the high efficiency cores Tempest, then the a 13 year, it was lightning
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:43.100]  and thunder for high performance, high efficiency. And then last year, with the a 14, which is
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:50.300]  in the iPhones 12, and the iPad, the new iPad Air from last fall, firestorm and ice storm
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:56.520]  firestorm is high performance. And so that the a 14 to high performance to the firestorm
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:03.900]  for of the high efficiency ice storm, the M one goes four of each, but they're still
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:09.880]  it is the same cores, right? Like the it's like the 2020 cores. So that's the thing.
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:16.260]  It's like if they came out with like pro Apple Silicon Max, and they called it the M one
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:23.580]  x m one to me would mean the firestorm ice storm cores. Oh, interesting from last year,
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:27.780]  and maybe they add more of them, right? So maybe it's 16 cores instead of eight cores,
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:31.820]  and it's eight, eight of each eight, eight high performance, eight high efficiency, I
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.420]  don't know how they want to mix and match them. But it would be weird if they came out
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:40.900]  with these with this, these products that are completely under their control with their
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:47.660]  chips. To me, it would be weird if they came out with pro MacBook 16 inch MacBook Pro,
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:54.220]  and maybe the iMac Pro with the M one x and it's got more cores. And so if you're doing
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:59.940]  X code, X code doubles in speed, because you've got double the course, but single core performance
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.020]  would be worse than the new iPhone that's coming out in September. Yeah, yeah, this
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.580]  is so that's right. So there, I hadn't thought about it that way, but you're totally it is
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:14.340]  that an M two has got to increase core performance. And so an M one x is, I think you're exactly
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:21.500]  right is quantity as opposed to the like the core, the literal core, and also GPU to write,
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:28.180]  I mean, eight core GPU is great, but they could be putting a 12 or 16 core one into
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:33.660]  a professional into a pro model, right? It doesn't seem it does not seem that the GPU
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:42.220]  in these as as sufficient as it is, for typical users needs, it's not a pro GPU. You know,
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:45.980]  and leaving aside the whole issue of PC gaming and stuff, there's all sorts of professional
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:54.740]  reasons to want a better GPU. And it's also very, very, as much as Apple is milking, not
[01:59:54.740 --> 02:00:00.580]  milking, that's it, that sounds too negative. But there, it's extraordinary that this M
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:10.260]  one chip is both for $700 Mac minis, and for $1,700 iMacs, and also for portables. And
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:14.820]  it's great. It's not just like, oh, yeah, it's a it's a great desktop chip, and you
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:18.420]  can use it in a portable and it's like, Oh, well, what's it do to battery life? Oh, it
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.380]  doubles your it doubles your battery life.
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:25.220]  I remain I've told people this a bunch, I've had the M one MacBook Air for five months
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:30.660]  almost. And I still am in disbelief when I do a lot of things on it that it works as
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:36.220]  well as it does. Like I, it's almost like an ongoing marketing machine. Because, like
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.660]  you, I've used Macs for decades. And I've enjoyed some significant improvements in performance
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:45.780]  over the years. But this one is ridiculous. So every time I touch it, I'm like, that
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.500]  can't just have happened that fast. And I, you know,
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:56.260]  the battery life thing amazes me. I serve I typically keep my Mac in my office and downstairs
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:01:00.460]  in the kitchens on the second floor. But I was I forget what I was doing. But I wanted
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:06.520]  to be with the family. And so I had took my Mac, my Mac book up there. And I didn't plug
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.460]  it in. I have USB C up there. But I didn't realize I didn't plug it in. I'd been up there
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:14.580]  like all weekend. I was like, huh, this isn't plugged in. I look at the battery and it said
[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:19.300]  like 61% is still remaining. And I'm like, what doesn't make any sense. Get this, though.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:23.340]  You know what was added? And you're going to love this and Big Sur 11.3 just came out.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:29.500]  You know what they, they, they added that wasn't there before was hibernation for M1s.
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:32.540]  So it was getting that battery life with unless you're well, I don't know if you're bringing
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:37.540]  the beta back that far, but so it didn't have hibernation mode. So it got the battery life
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:42.780]  with just normal sleep mode. That's crazy. It's really insane. So with hibernation mode,
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:46.940]  I figured you could probably, you know, go around the world and, and, you know, do like,
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:50.820]  I don't know, like 18 hours of use on the thing over 30 days and it would still have
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:52.620]  a charge at the end.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:56.740]  It's the whole Apple Silicon story for Mac. And one of the things that to me is so exciting
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:01.780]  about it is that they've so successfully kept their cards close to their vest, right? Nobody
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:06.980]  knew what these, we were kind of hoping for IMAX last week, but nobody knew what they
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:09.940]  looked like. And never somebody, you know, somebody said, ah, they're going to be in
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:13.620]  colors again. We didn't know what colors, you know, we didn't know how thin nobody was
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:19.940]  like this thing looks like a giant iPad from the side. I mean, it literally is the thickness
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:26.500]  of the original iPhone. The whole thing is as thick as the original iPhone. It's crazy.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:31.460]  Nobody knew what the initial lineup of M1 Max was going to be last November. No, it's
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:36.340]  it's all terribly exciting. And nobody knows what their story is with Pro IMAX, which is
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:40.700]  so I tell my wife this, I said, we don't know what's coming. And this is what, and no one
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:45.180]  knew that the M when the M1 shipped, it was a shock to everybody. What exactly? And she's
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:50.780]  like, that's not usual, is it? I'm like, no, somehow Apple's kept a tighter lips on this
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:55.460]  than any product they've released in, I don't know how many years or decades, maybe because
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:03:00.420]  it's so different. But, so here's, here's my best guess. And I have no inside information
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:04.860]  about this at all. I don't even know where I would go. I mean, I, you know, John Ternus
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:10.260]  is not entering his phone when I call him to ask for tips. But here's what I think.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:15.420]  And I'm just mainly looking at the calendar. And just thinking about the fact that the
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:24.020]  room for a Pro tier of M1 is sort of running out because the A15, which will have the same
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:30.900]  cores as the next generation M2 is absolutely, we all know is slated for September. Now,
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:35.540]  whether it'll be late, probably not this year, if it wasn't late last year with COVID. But
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:40.740]  we know iPads or iPhones come out in September, or at least get announced then. And it'll
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:45.540]  be the new two cores. That's so I think they're running out of time. And I kind of think back
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.780]  to last year when they first announced this transition, and they did say it would be over
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:54.820]  the next two years. And I kind of chalk that up to a sort of institutional under promise
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:59.620]  over deliver, right? Let's say two years. But like when they did the Intel transition,
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:04.940]  they got the whole thing done in a year. They had the whole Mac lineup done in a year with
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:12.340]  going from PowerPC to Intel. What if it really is two years? And in that two year thing is
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:20.780]  that the M1, the first year of Apple Silicon for Macs is entirely consumer based. And it's
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:26.620]  with the year two, where there'll be an M2 for consumer Macs. And then that's when we
[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:31.940]  see the M2X. And that's the pro story. So you're thinking consumer that there's possibility
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:38.300]  April 2022 before there's a consumer M2, and then fall for a pro M2. I wouldn't be surprised
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:43.380]  if they can do the M2X later this year. But I'm thinking, you know, that maybe like, you
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:48.060]  know, it seems like from the rumors and from what people are most, you know, what I know
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:52.740]  is popular and what people are waiting for. It's the 16 inch MacBook Pro that people really,
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:56.100]  really want. Yeah, I mean, I could see that, right, I could see them holding off on other
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:59.060]  designs. But then if they can do that, they could do anything, right? I mean, it's not
[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:00.060]  a right.
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:03.620]  And then, you know, but then it gives them another six months to figure out what the,
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:07.460]  you know, because the and then the other end of the, the far end of the spectrum is how
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:14.260]  do they replace the Mac Pro, where you're, you know, that a fully spec'd Intel Mac Pro
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:21.380]  right now is insane. It's, you know, I don't know, it's like 5000 cores. It's, but it,
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:26.300]  you know, and you can, I mean, you put terabytes of RAM into it. It's, it's, it's nutty. Yeah,
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:29.660]  so it's, that's what I'm thinking. It has to be a different, there's a different way
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:34.860]  of thinking about it then. I mean, you know, for years, it's been like the iPad and iPhone
[02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:40.260]  and lower end, the consumer Macs were all kind of the same thing. And then the phones
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:44.900]  and iPads were outperforming. And now you have an iPad Pro that's using the same chip
[02:05:44.900 --> 02:05:51.420]  as, you know, the consumer Mac. So it's all in alignment now. But the Mac Pro is, you
[02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:55.380]  know, just something beyond that. So it's got to be something, I mean, so that's the
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:06:00.780]  thing is, what if it's two years for the Mac Pro, right? But it's not two years for, you
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:07.220]  know, a, an iMac Pro and a 16 inch MacBook Pro and a refreshed 13 inch Mac Pro.
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:11.180]  Right, exactly. Or at least a second tier, right? Like I, what I could see them doing
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:15.500]  with the third. And, you know, there's rumors that they're going to 14 inches from 13 inches
[02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:20.500]  where maybe it'll go. And so maybe, maybe, maybe they keep the 13 inch one around at
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:27.060]  a 1400 ish price point, but they come out with a Pro Pro 14 inch smaller MacBook Pro
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:34.060]  with the M2, maybe the M2X, whatever. Maybe it has to be the M2X because it goes to 32
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:40.380]  or 64 gigs of RAM. And it starts at $2,000. You know, but the, if you, oh wow, I don't
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:44.300]  want to spend $2,000. Well, don't, no, we got the, you know, there's all the holes in
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:47.820]  the product. I mean, the product matrix has the holes in it. And I think it's, I mean,
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:51.300]  you know, as you, as you've written about, I think quite eloquently, eloquently when
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:54.340]  reporters are like, well, they haven't made the decision about X yet. And you're like,
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:58.900]  it's two months. They made the decision like a year ago, guys, you know, come on. So they've
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:04.180]  either made M2 chips already or they're, you know, in mass production in a, whatever. There
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:08.580]  are tons of people at Apple who know everything we're speculating about and they're all keeping
[02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:12.700]  their mouth shut. And I love it. It's amazing. It's amazing. No, I love, I love that. No,
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:16.180]  I was, I want to hit one of the consumer points though, too, though. It's just in passing
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:19.820]  is it's weird to me. It's just, it reminds me of, you know, it's not the Schneider cut
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:23.460]  level, it's not a cut level of things, but it's like people like how it's kind of a little
[02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:27.860]  bit of a, oh, Apple's playing to the, or how dare they make colorful Macs. I'm like, you
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:32.220]  don't have to buy one. They have a, as, as Jason Stells calling it, the, the no color,
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:36.860]  right? There's seven, it's six colors plus a non color. Isn't it? And you can buy the
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:42.300]  non color one. So I don't know. I, but I think it's, I think it's wonderful to see them trying
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:46.620]  something different after a lot of uniformity for a lot of years. And this is like the purple
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:50.160]  phone and whatever people want to do things a little different. Apple's got its fingers
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:54.840]  on what people want. They, you know, they don't, we know they famously don't do a focus
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:57.380]  groups the way a lot of the industry does, but they listen to people, they listen to
[02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:02.460]  what CUS sat, what is it? The, uh, yeah, customer sat. Yeah. So they, they know that. And, uh,
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:07.100]  so this is clearly something they think they want it. They can do, they can do interestingly.
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:12.900]  Um, the whole like accessorized thing, all being the same color is pretty neat. I am
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:18.140]  a Johnny Ive fan boy. I love the guy's work. I've talked to him a few times and he's always
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:24.300]  been charming and delightful and truly inner. And I think he's done wonderful work for Apple,
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:32.380]  did wonderful work for decades, but it's impossible not to see the post Steve Jobs era of Johnny
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:38.820]  Ive as chief design officer as clearly, I mean, there's stuff we can speculate on thinness
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:45.420]  and other design decisions, but the move towards monochromatic hardware is undeniable. I mean,
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:52.980]  there's absolutely no denying that an awful lot of the product lineup went towards very
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.900]  true at Johnny's terms, honest, you know, that this is honest to the materials it's
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:04.580]  made of and aluminum looks like aluminum, um, you know, and, and, and trends and things
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:09.540]  go in waves and who knows, maybe if Johnny Ive was still there, it would be just as colorful,
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.660]  you know, and maybe these are just colors of IMAX that he signed off on before he left.
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:20.440]  I don't know, but it is very welcome to me. And again, if, whether it's completely serendipitous
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:27.860]  with the timing of the disaster and melancholy of 2020, it really feels incredibly well,
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:32.500]  timed in a way that it almost might've felt inappropriate a year ago. Right. Oh God. Yeah.
[02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:41.100]  Oh my God. If they had released like September or something, it'd be like, oh, Apple. No,
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:46.820]  not right now. One of my favorite gags of all time was from the movie, the naked gun,
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:51.860]  right? You have to be a fan of the movie. Oh yeah. Yeah. So it's the part where Leslie
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:57.740]  Nielsen's detective. Oh man, what was his name? Well, whatever his name was. Leslie
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:02.920]  Nielsen's detective character is falling in love with Priscilla Presley. And there's this
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.160]  montage of hilarious scenes in there. It didn't matter what happens and where they go. They're
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:12.020]  just so happy and light on their feet and they're coming out of a movie theater and
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:16.420]  they're just laughing and holding hands and skipping. And the camera slowly pulls back
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:19.780]  and everybody else coming out of the theater looks like they're coming out of a funeral
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:25.460]  and you realize that they just went to see platoon. Oh my God. Right. That to me would've
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:29.940]  been like, you know, that's, that would've been like, Hey, look at these cheerful, bright,
[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:33.380]  colorful IMAX last year. It's like, yeah, I don't know. I think we needed everything
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:39.660]  to be sort of dark gray last year. I didn't wait. It feels very well timed and serendipitous
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:42.940]  or not. Can I call out, there's something that I am in love with, with these that's
[02:10:42.940 --> 02:10:47.420]  not related to the Mac. It's the touch ID on a keyboard, on an external keyboard. I
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:51.340]  should not have forgotten to mention that. I just, cause I mean, years ago when they
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:56.820]  first released a secure, a secure enclave in an iMac, I was like, well, how are they
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:59.980]  going to touch ID? They can't do it. You know, they can't do an external keyboard at the,
[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:04.940]  ah, well Apple's clever. They'll have some kind of USB based thing because they wouldn't
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.060]  trust it to blue. I don't know. And then it never appeared. And I thought, all right,
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.500]  maybe this is just a thing they can't do. You know, they don't want to have an ugly,
[02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:14.700]  they're not going to stick a touch ID sensor on the front of your iMac. You have to touch.
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:17.940]  That would be weird. And you're not going to do with a Mac mini and whatever. So I was
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:20.980]  like, okay, it's just never going to happen. And then this happened and I was like, oh,
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:25.980]  they needed to redesign secure enclave so that it could accept like wireless, direct
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:32.420]  wireless connections, doing some kind of proprietary thing over the, uh, not the w whatever their,
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:37.320]  their wireless chip is. Yeah. The U1 maybe. I don't know. Yeah. So there's some, yeah,
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:40.820]  so there's something going on where they control the protocol, they control the wireless thing
[02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:46.700]  and secure enclave can securely do wireless communication because it's only for M1 devices
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:51.260]  and I thought that's kind of cool actually. Yeah. I would anticipate that. I don't know
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.380]  when it would come out. Maybe you have to wait a year, but you know how Apple always
[02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:59.540]  issues their security state of Apple security white paper. I feel like learning how the,
[02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:05.740]  if they can explain even in basic layman's terms, how the touch ID security works with
[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:12.280]  the air gap. I sounds fast. Should be fascinating. Uh, I think you've talked about it on the
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:17.020]  podcast, the Apple platform security guy that came out in February. Yeah. That was, I mean,
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:24.900]  I recommend listeners if you have any interest in how Apple does anything, that is one of
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:29.300]  the greatest documents Apple's ever produced. I could not have written my M series book
[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:36.100]  without it because it digs into like boot modes and um, uh, this is just by the way
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:40.460]  also, but did you know, you might probably know this, you know that you can't, uh, if
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:45.300]  your max, uh, there's a, there are special hidden partitions you can and should not erase
[02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:51.260]  on an M one Mac. Yeah. Yeah. So if your M one SSD dies, you cannot boot it up externally
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:55.540]  because the policy information for external boot is stored in hidden partitions on the
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:13:01.020]  internal SSD. And that's one of these super weird things and you can sort of extract it
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:04.380]  from the platform security guide. But there's also like, there's a thousand other little
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:09.060]  interesting details in there that has helped me as an M one as a writer, but also as an
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:15.700]  owner, it just understanding how they pulled all this stuff off. Um, anyway, it's a fast,
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:18.420]  it's a fascinating read and eventually I hope they'll update it sooner than another year
[02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:19.740]  or two with this.
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:22.980]  I, yeah, that's what I, that's why I was thinking we may have to wait for it cause I know it
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:29.100]  just came out a few, just a few weeks ago. Um, but it's, you know, so I guess the other
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:34.500]  thing I would be doing, our mutual friend John Siracusa disfavor by not mentioning the
[02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:39.180]  fact that these IMAX do not have face ID. They've owned, you know, they're, they're
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.780]  only biometric is the touch ID, which is optional. You have to pay a little bit extra for the
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:47.940]  keyboard. I forget. I think it's like 40 bucks. Yeah. If you don't buy, if you are, do you,
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:51.980]  it's if you buy the low end model, it's not included, but if you buy it, so they have
[02:13:51.980 --> 02:13:57.060]  like three tiers standard models. Yeah. And it's unclear cause the ethernet port, they
[02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:00.620]  don't have the build to cause you can't actually order them yet. They don't have the build
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:07.780]  to order things so you don't know, can I just get the lowest end new IMAX and just upgrade
[02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:13.740]  the keyboard to touch ID? I don't know. Probably. But, um, but they, you know, that's the thing
[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:21.320]  about going touch ID on the keyboard is it's apparently in lieu of face ID, uh, which I
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.220]  think would be slicker. Um, but I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm overlooking something
[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:30.460]  Siracusa seems to think that they should just have face ID. You know, you're right in front
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:35.780]  of it. There's always a camera. I think there's a, if, I mean, I remember reading about the
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:39.700]  technology they're using. I think they'd have to develop different technology, although
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:44.700]  because they're not tapping, um, battery power to do it, they could probably do it. But I
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:49.180]  mean, it's, I think you have to be relatively close. So do you want to have to like lean
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:55.060]  like get closer to the camera, move your head? No, closer, closer. Yeah, I don't know. But
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:58.380]  if you're close enough to touch the button on the keyboard, aren't you inherently close
[02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:01.700]  enough? I don't know. Well, you could have the keyboard far away. I think the distance,
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:06.500]  like I think I'm two feet. I have a tape measure. I'm currently, look, I can live measurement.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:12.900]  I am currently, uh, yeah, about 24 inches eyeball from, um, from my IMAX screen as we
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:18.940]  talk. And I think a lot of people are like 18 to 24 inches away typically. So, um, that
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:23.380]  I think maybe the, well, I've got the 20. I wonder, I wonder if it's not just that face
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:31.260]  ID is by Apple's, you know, Tim Cook's spreadsheet numbers just too expensive because the, to
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:37.060]  me, and to me, the tell on that is that that new iPad air that was actually the first thing
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:43.500]  to have the A14 in it last September has touch ID on a button instead of face ID. You know,
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.460]  I figured that was, didn't you think that was pandemic air though? That was a choice
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:50.660]  that was made for the pandemic, but they didn't want to add to the, you know, I don't see,
[02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:54.400]  I think that was too late. I think that I, I don't think that, you know, for a device
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:57.860]  that debuted, I'm sorry. No, you're right. No, that would have been too late. I was thinking
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:02.620]  the iPad pro. Yeah. Uh, I, you know, I mean, we know that Apple can do seemingly anything.
[02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:07.620]  So my suspicion is they would need, um, have to have a separate hole cut for an infrared
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:13.580]  camera in the, um, in the top where they already have that kind of built from the glass on
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:19.260]  an iPhone or iPad. So, uh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I, I like face ID at first. I thought
[02:16:19.260 --> 02:16:22.820]  it was, I just did not get into it and I was like, this is great. I said to myself just
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:28.020]  before we all had to put on masks for a year. Um, I just think, I just think it might be
[02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:35.180]  that face ID is, you know, and when this, my, my hypothetical iMac pro comes out sometime
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:41.940]  later this year, I would think whether it's June or September or November, like one year
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:47.960]  after the first batch of Apple silica, I wouldn't be surprised if the iMac pro iMac pro has
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:52.980]  face ID. Oh yeah. Cause then they can put in the extra buck 50 in cost of goods for,
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:56.940]  for putting it. Yeah. And you know, and as we've said already, they, we know in the lab
[02:16:56.940 --> 02:17:02.100]  somewhere, there is an iMac behind steel doors that does face ID cause of course they're
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:06.460]  testing it and they either it's the cost or maybe they decided the experience was too
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:11.820]  awkward in their scenarios or they wanted to, I don't know, maybe they're in cause you
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:16.820]  don't need, it's weird because I think the, it's just easier to hide into the experience
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:22.340]  and move your phone closer or farther away as necessary. Um, but it's also touch ID is
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:27.780]  a generally good experience. You know, originally it was a little weird now. It's so, uh, incredibly
[02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:32.220]  reliable. I mean, I didn't own, I had the 2015 Mac book, so I didn't get touch ID in
[02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:38.180]  a laptop until last spring and um, I didn't really know I was missing it as much. And
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:41.380]  now I'm like, Oh my God, what was it like to have to enter my password? I'm like, well,
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:46.220]  I have an iMac that I use as my office machine. So I'm, I'm constantly looking at like, my
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:50.440]  finger is moving to my keyboard that doesn't have touch ID as my iMac is pronouncing me
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:56.460]  for a password. I'm like, Oh God, I got to take my password in again. So it seems barbaric
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:00.860]  unless you just restarted. But you know, it does raise the question then of the one thing
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:07.600]  Apple has never done yet is ship any device that supports two methods of biometric authentication.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.540]  They have touch ID devices and they have face ID devices and so far near the twain shall
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:22.340]  meet. If they were to make an M class iMac with face ID or a Mac book pro with face ID,
[02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:28.900]  any Mac with face ID, what would happen if you paired a touch ID keyboard with it? Which,
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:35.060]  you know, it it's, and it's sort of a tricky question on the whole in the long run. I think
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:39.420]  it's very obvious that our computers will be using more and more senses for lack of
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:44.660]  a better word to do all sorts of things. I mean, they use cameras for all sorts of things
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:49.040]  now. Now they're using the, the, the ambient light sensor on the phone to help you calibrate
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:57.140]  your TV. As we just mentioned, our devices are gaining senses and the ways that a human
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:01.740]  recognizes another person, like if you and I, you know, ran into each other on the street,
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:05.860]  I would probably see you first, but if I heard your voice, I would know, Hey, that sounds
[02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:13.500]  like Glenn, right? Multiple senses are good. So it, you know, face ID plus touch ID is
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:18.860]  in some sense better because it's certainly more secure if you were doing, you know, like
[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:24.060]  something so secure, you know, updating the operating system and they wants to check both
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:29.180]  face ID and touch ID. I don't know, but what happens if it's like, ah, in the middle, do
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:32.700]  you get to choose, you know, if it's just like a typical, Oh, you want to delete this
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:38.140]  one file and the finder wants you to authenticate before you move it to the trash. Do you get
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:40.460]  to do either?
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:44.740]  It's tricky too, because of like the negative matches too. Like I, I'm constantly surprised
[02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:48.140]  because of mask wearing how often my phone's like, Oh, you got to enter your password.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:53.220]  I'm like, I didn't, but I didn't look at you for a while. Why? So it's very sensitive.
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:20:00.100]  And the other thing about face ID is, Hmm, wait, nothing that happens with face ID other
[02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:05.100]  than unlocking the device, which is where you just want to get in. But when it's confirmation,
[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:10.420]  Oh, you want to confirm a purchase or you want to confirm the destruction. You're always
[02:20:10.420 --> 02:20:15.520]  have to, well, no, you always have to double click a button to make sure it doesn't happen
[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:19.740]  by accident. Right? The worst thing you'd ever want is, is you, you go to trash this
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:23.780]  important sensitive file and the computer's like, well, let me double check with face
[02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:29.700]  ID up. He's, he's right in front of the computer. There it goes deleted, right? And so if you're
[02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.980]  right eye twice, wink, wink, and that's.
[02:20:31.980 --> 02:20:38.060]  So if you have to confirm face ID with some kind of button push anyway, why not just have
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:42.060]  touch ID on the button in the first place? Cause then it's just the button. So there's,
[02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:45.100]  there's a part of me that says maybe face ID has never come into the Mac.
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:50.340]  Right. Cause what's the, I mean the, the ease of face ID is to not have to interact with,
[02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:54.460]  I mean, even with the buttons, but like to unlock or something, it's a, it's a reduction
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:59.220]  in a like inefficient interaction that could cause rejection. So like getting your finger
[02:20:59.220 --> 02:21:03.300]  touch ID works great, but you still have to, it's often a two hand operation or you got
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:09.020]  your thumbs the right spot. So it can be awkward in a, in a mobile device and face ID is a
[02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:12.620]  very efficient, you know, you hold it up, even if you have to double click, you do it
[02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:16.220]  one handed and you just look at it, you do the thing, dumped up, it's done. When you're
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:19.500]  on a keyboard, you're always, you just rest your finger on touch ID. Oh, you want to confirm
[02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:24.700]  it. You hold your finger down. It says, great, done. And that it's a, I think it's a simpler
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:29.540]  interaction for that modality because it's right. The intentionality behind it, but also
[02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:35.460]  just like where your hands and grip is related to what you're doing.
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:41.380]  So anyway, we'll see, you know, but it's unanswered question. Anyway, I would love, I know, and
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:45.580]  I know it would have been the answer to our face masking year is it would have been great
[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:52.220]  to have iPhones that did both face ID and touch ID on the power button. Right. It's,
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:56.180]  you know, and maybe they'll come out with it. It'll just be too, hopefully, hopefully
[02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.180]  too late.
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:01.900]  I was just hoping they'd figure out a way. I think, I mean, I've read a lot about secure
[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:05.940]  enclave and I'm not a cryptographer, but I I'd hoped that they would figure out a method
[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:12.500]  of doing. No, I think, I mean, I think they've, they built it into such a hard coded mode
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:19.180]  to avoid, uh, you know, government and criminal and whatever interception that they can't
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:25.780]  just say, Oh, here's an update that lets you unlock your phone, uh, without face ID or
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:30.740]  with a poor face ID mask, like an eyeball face ID mask for 15 minutes after the last
[02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:33.700]  time you updated it. Like they just won't, I don't think they can do it. I'm not sure
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:39.340]  if they, uh, would have done it if they could, but it may simply be a limit in how secure
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:40.580]  the systems designed.
[02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:44.740]  Yeah, it is. I know one thing I've heard from ever since face ID came out and I heard from
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:50.380]  during fireball readers who are medical professionals and they wear face masks, you know, in normal
[02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:55.860]  times. Um, and they say what a pain in the ass this whole thing has been. Um, and I know
[02:22:55.860 --> 02:23:01.220]  that culturally it, you know, it's, everybody knows now, but like in most of Asia in flu
[02:23:01.220 --> 02:23:06.180]  season, it's very common to see just, you know, normal years without a coronavirus pandemic.
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:11.860]  You just see lots of people wearing face masks. And again, the face ID was met with objections
[02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:17.860]  there that in pre COVID U S didn't exist. So it's interesting that it's on Apple's radar
[02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:22.260]  now as a, Oh yeah, this hits home to us. You know, it's just like anything weather related
[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:26.180]  where it's like, Oh, sometimes the weather isn't like Cupertino 72 degrees and sunny.
[02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:27.180]  Huh?
[02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:31.340]  Yeah. I mean, this is, and also like, you know, what my future is, uh, I mean, I was,
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:37.340]  I was delighted, um, as I know you were the CDC bowed to a scientific wisdom and is relaxing
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:42.140]  the outdoor masking recommendations by using science and clinical research. That's great.
[02:23:42.140 --> 02:23:46.460]  Uh, but for me, I'm like, well, I'm going to wear a mask like 10 months the year, either
[02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:50.780]  outdoors or in congregate settings from now on, because I have seasonal allergies this
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:55.300]  last two years. I mean, look, I'm looking for bright linings, right? Any silver lining.
[02:23:55.300 --> 02:24:00.020]  My allergies have been fantastic. And I saw my allergist a few months ago and uh, he said,
[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:03.780]  you know, you should just wear a cloth mask from, you know, February to June any year
[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:06.740]  now. And I was like, Oh really? And he's like, yeah, it'll totally help you. I'm like, Oh
[02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:11.380]  Jesus. It just wasn't socialized. Have you seen, have you seen the numbers on influenza
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:18.860]  in the U S it was like 18 deaths in the entire season. It's just unbelievable. Yeah. And
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:22.660]  that's the other thing is I've had the flu twice in the last, you know, two, three years
[02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:26.820]  ago or three or four years ago. And once I got the kind that not only did I get it and
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:30.580]  then recover, I got, I had side effects that lasted for four months. I got this terrible
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:34.860]  heart inflammation thing. Oh my God. Oh, it's this time you've got people have recovered
[02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:39.700]  fully from it, but um, it's just, it takes months to recover, to get back to normal.
[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:43.900]  And um, and I was like, God damn it. So I'm like, all right, so from February to June,
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:48.980]  I'm going to wear a mask for allergies. And then from, I guess, September to may, I'm
[02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:54.300]  going to wear a mask for flu. So I guess you'll see me in June, June and July, July and August
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:57.620]  without a mask in the future. Cause it'll be acceptable. The thing that's so startling
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:01.260]  about the influenza numbers and they were so worried about it. They were like, Oh my
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:05.140]  God, it could be a double whammy. But it's like the, the precautions we collectively
[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:10.300]  took, even with all of the controversy over large swaths of America who didn't want to
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:15.820]  wear masks and businesses who, who wanted to reopen as early as they could. And as soon
[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:19.060]  as the numbers came down a little bit, it's like, well, let's reopen everything. And then
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:24.460]  the numbers spike back on all of that nonsense all year long. What we were doing was enough
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:32.060]  to completely all effectively, I know not, not 0.0 all the way, but 0.00 something. Yeah.
[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:39.460]  Get rid of influenza. That shows you how crazy contagious COVID-19 is, right? Yeah. But it's
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:44.620]  both horribly contagious. And then like, you know, it's like very contagious and not contagious.
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:50.740]  Like no fomite spread, basically no outdoor, real outdoor transmission. So coronavirus
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:56.020]  only spreads into COVID-19, right? Limited cases. But apparently the flu, if we all just
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:59.660]  took a little bit more care, we could have gotten rid of it years ago. It really is amazing
[02:25:59.660 --> 02:26:02.980]  that in the midst of a pandemic, it's the first time I can remember where I've gone.
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:07.740]  Like, I don't know, 14, 15 months now. I mean, cause I, I say 14, 15 because I don't think
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:11.420]  I was sick early last year either just by luck, but it's like, I haven't been sick in
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:17.120]  a year. It's crazy. I know there are, there's silver linings in the middle of all the horror.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.220]  It's like, there are some things. There's also, I mean, you know, again, sidebar, but
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:25.220]  all these things were like, well, there might be an effective HIV vaccine. There might be
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:28.360]  a vaccine against malaria. There might be, you're like, oh my God, you know, hundreds
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.660]  of thousands of people died here in millions worldwide, but perhaps hundreds of millions
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:39.000]  of people will live in the next 20 to 50 years because of improvements that were discovered
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.940]  in the last two years. So there is something to look forward to in terms of global health.
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:47.700]  I mean, that's, that's a good, if that outcome turns out to be true and then hooray.
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:52.020]  All right, let me take one last break here. Thank our fourth and final bonus sponsor of
[02:26:52.020 --> 02:26:57.420]  the episode. Oh, and I do, I have a soft spot for these guys too, because they are the most

[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:36.980]  Unbelievable deal. My thanks to Squarespace. Go to squarespace.com slash talk show and
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:42.340]  remember that code talk show for more information. All right. We're running long shocker for
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:49.100]  me and you. Unbelievable. iPad Pro. That's what, last but not least, that was Apple's
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:56.340]  last announcement. I sort of have the least to say about it because it's like, I expected
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:02.980]  them to say it has the A14X. In my mind, what an A14X is, isn't really different from the
[02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:07.180]  M1. So now that I think, I'm like, why did I even think that? Because like I told you,
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:13.300]  I knew it was going to have A14 caliber cores, the Firestorm and Ice Storm. Because it's
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:17.440]  the iPad Pro, of course it would be for high performance instead of just too high performance
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:23.580]  and it would have an eight core GPU instead of four core GPU. And that's the M1, right?
[02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:28.700]  And what else is there? You know, I mean, it's Thunderbolt, right? Well, the iPad Pro
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:34.740]  can use Thunderbolt. So it's Thunderbolt slash USB four ports. So for the high performance
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:35.740]  IO.
[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:38.900]  I mean, for all everybody was like, the Mac is going to become an iPad. It turned out
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:45.060]  the iPad became a Mac. Here's my question. Let me ask you a provocative question. So
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:49.260]  why not? I mean, it's not that provocative. Why not have a Mac OS compatibility layer
[02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:50.260]  on an iPad?
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:53.660]  That's what everybody's talking about, right? I mean, it could maybe they would do it. I
[02:29:53.660 --> 02:30:00.100]  don't know. Maybe not. I don't know. I mean, so many really weird there. It's like this.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:03.540]  There's this whole, I haven't linked to them yet, but there's like, I have a whole built
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:10.660]  up stash of links to what I'm calling the iPad malcontents. And it's not people who
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:17.940]  are outside the iPad ecosystem complaining about this thing they don't use, you know,
[02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:23.380]  like, like, if I were to complain too much about Windows or PC users complaining about
[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:26.860]  the Mac, and you're like, you don't even know what it is. Now, I'm talking about people
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:35.740]  like Jason Snell. And people who use the iPad full time for work are the ones who have the
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:43.220]  most astute criticism of it in Yes, in this spectrum of this is the best hardware I own.
[02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:50.020]  I love it. I love so much about this device as it is. But yet I there's there's software
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:55.380]  on the Mac that is so much more powerful. Why can't I use that on the iPad? And is it
[02:30:55.380 --> 02:31:00.100]  a is the answer a Mac compatibility layer? I mean, I know that the one verge I forget
[02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:04.540]  who wrote it, but the verge story was like, just just put Mac OS on iPad or something
[02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:05.540]  like that.
[02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:09.380]  Well, right. And that's, I mean, right. That's would be them. I mean, Apple will never capitulate.
[02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:14.460]  I don't think ever. I say, I say never. And then it's like, we'll never put TV on an iPad
[02:31:14.460 --> 02:31:23.300]  or an iPad. Right. I don't know that Apple wants to release a touch screen Mac, even
[02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:28.500]  though the iPad Pro with a keyboard is so very close to a touchscreen Mac. So what is
[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:33.580]  what is the difference? But I think just the way they said we're gonna have an iOS and
[02:31:33.580 --> 02:31:38.420]  iPad OS, I think Mac OS remain disparate or different. The thing is, it comes down to
[02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:41.980]  the Mac App Store, right and locking down the app. So if Apple makes it possible to
[02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:48.980]  run Mac OS apps on an iPad Pro, I cannot believe they will let you run arbitrary side loaded
[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:52.420]  apps will all only be Mac App Store apps that you can run.
[02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:56.180]  Right. And then that immediately rules out a bunch of the professional apps people are
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:59.420]  talking about. And I know there's a bunch of professional apps that are in the Mac App
[02:31:59.420 --> 02:32:04.660]  Store, but there are some prominent ones that are not and you know, it does that make it
[02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:09.180]  worth it them doing it now to do that probably I don't know I don't think it's suddenly opening
[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:15.220]  up an iPad audience doesn't make it worthwhile for them to become part of the App Store environment
[02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:23.220]  iPad as exemplified by the iPad Pro in particular because it's you know, it's truly puts it's
[02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:28.620]  not just pro meaning more expensive or nicer. It's pro meaning has truly professional specs,
[02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:33.260]  right? These these these iPads go up to 16 gigabytes of RAM now. They're actually terabytes
[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:39.540]  of storage. They're telling us the previous limit was 512 gigs. Glenn, they're so pro
[02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:49.340]  that they're telling us how much RAM is in them. Right. Okay, that's right. That's it.
[02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:55.380]  But they are in a weird space that no Apple computer has ever been in before. I mean,
[02:32:55.380 --> 02:33:02.260]  here's this thing that is 11 years old platform, and you still can't write iPad software on
[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:06.820]  an iPad. It did not even close. There's nothing I mean, who knows, maybe this is the year
[02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:13.040]  where they announced Xcode for iPad, you know, and and this is a lament that only has five
[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:19.700]  weeks of life. I don't know. But it is that's weird, right? I mean, and it was totally weird.
[02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:24.980]  But that's when you need the M2. I mean, you did a pro M series chip to do Xcode. I don't
[02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:30.100]  I mean, I don't really but maybe I don't well, no, because we know that the M1 it's a great
[02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:34.740]  developer machine on No, you're right. It's so everybody who has one on a Mac already
[02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:40.420]  loves it. And most Xcode projects are way faster. I know I have a friend with a private
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:43.900]  friend who has an app that actually compiled slower. And he's like, I must be the weird
[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:48.540]  exception. But for the most part, it's faster. It's this thing that drove me crazy about
[02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:52.580]  I had my iMac, I actually just switched to an external SSD. Finally, a Thunderbolt based
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:57.940]  one for my iMac at a fusion drive. And it took me forever. And, and it's whatever. So
[02:33:57.940 --> 02:34:02.440]  I was infusion was generally fine, except for certain apps. So I got the M1 and running
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:09.340]  Creative Cloud, like launching Photoshop and using it on my M1 with 16 gigs was, you know,
[02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:14.940]  orders of magnitude faster than running Photoshop on a quad core 2017 iMac. I'm like, Oh, for
[02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:19.900]  great, you know, what did they in emulation and I'm like, Oh, come on. So yeah, I can
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:24.300]  imagine how the developers feel with Xcode because it's such a hog.
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:28.780]  I've seen, you know, and like Photoshop comes up a lot because there is Photoshop for iPad,
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:34.220]  Apple even showed it off in the iPad Pro thing. And I hear I bring this up or I didn't even
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:38.060]  have to bring it up. And people who read my site, watch the show. And they're like, that's
[02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:43.580]  not real Photoshop. I need real Photoshop. Why can't I have real Photoshop and it's like
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:47.700]  Photoshop for M1 now it's doesn't have all the features yet. They have a you know, so
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:53.220]  that's essentially Photoshop for iPad. That's not on an iPad yet. Like how hard is it to
[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:59.580]  recompile? I just custom target it. I just can't help but feel that it is sort of it
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:09.140]  we just have to accept the incompleteness of the story. You know, it's you're right.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:13.940]  It doesn't all add up. But it's sort of to me, it's sort of like the thing with the Apple
[02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:18.740]  TV hardware where people are like, well, 200 bucks is way too much expensive compared to
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:22.260]  Roku's and Apple's pushing the TV app all over the place that they should lower the
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:28.220]  price that they can't just make another Apple TV that costs $180. And it's like no, yeah,
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:33.380]  they can and that's fine. And it's like you can't just keep shipping these incredible
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:40.660]  iPad pros and not have software like the Mac Mac caliber software like where's Final Cut
[02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:46.180]  Pro right? What's the point of putting the pro display XDR caliber micro LED thing in
[02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:52.020]  the 12.9 inch iPad? Well, if it's such a great thing, like for color correction, why is there
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:57.260]  no Final Cut for iPad? Right, right. And once but here's the thing is once I mean, maybe
[02:35:57.260 --> 02:36:00.340]  this is there's always like the reverse Trojan horse or something I don't know what you want
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:08.420]  to call it. Where with every developer working to create arm compatible and one targeted
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:12.380]  versions of their Mac apps, then suddenly they have software that works on the iPad,
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:17.940]  more or less. I just don't know. I don't see it. I just don't see them adding app kit to
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:22.060]  iOS. I mean, but but they could just they could have a way to make it easy. You've written
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:25.780]  your you've written you don't have to run them. You don't necessarily have to run Mac
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:32.860]  OS apps in in iPad OS. But you can have M one targeted apps that are designed for Mac
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:38.620]  OS that are easy to then make iPad OS versions of but only through the App Store, right?
[02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:42.480]  I mean, it sort of happens today a bit. But I mean, that seemed like some of the issues
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:48.860]  going with catalyst and I know all these various efforts to provide some kind of platform synthesis,
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:56.580]  but it's weird that the iPad winds up being the loser in that scenario and not the Mac.
[02:36:56.580 --> 02:37:02.660]  I don't know, you know, and is it the loser? It's certainly it the iPad over well overall
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:06.180]  sells in much higher quantities than the Mac overall. No, no, you're right. I just mean
[02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:09.940]  in terms of software experience, right? It's all these things that the professionals I
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:13.620]  think you're right is I mean, when I look at this now, it's like, what is an iPad Pro
[02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:17.620]  that is not a Mac? It's like it has cellular connectivity built in, which Apple has never
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:23.300]  put into its, its Macs for whatever reason. And it's got better, you know, it's got camera
[02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:28.460]  stuff. It's got better cameras front and back and, and whatever and a lot of the rest of
[02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:31.980]  it is like it's not really, you know, there's nothing else that's that different anymore
[02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:38.620]  get more ports in a Mac, typically. So yeah, it's like what isn't what is an iPad for when
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:45.620]  it's so close to a Mac? Now, it is a different animal. But what is it for? I don't know.
[02:37:45.620 --> 02:37:51.060]  It's, you know, and again, I just kind of feel like the way that it is, maybe this is
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:55.860]  it, there is no other shoe to drop. And this is just at this many years in maybe just accept
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:38:00.840]  that. Yeah, it's, you know, there's a lot of stuff, you know, that Safari and notes
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:06.660]  and Apple Mail, you know, it all sort of works. But I mean, even, you know, Apple Mail there,
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:10.820]  it's maybe that's a bad example. Like why in the world with Apple Mail on iPad? Can
[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:16.020]  you not set up smart mailboxes? I love smart mailboxes. Yeah. Can you not still not caption
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:21.940]  photos in photos for iPad OS? I think it's possibly true that I don't know you can right
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:28.320]  but it took until recently I want to say latin movies, iPad iOS 14 iOS 14. But yeah, there's
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:35.580]  there's weird, weird absences, weird gaps. And the smart mailbox thing kills me. I live
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:41.540]  I live by a smart inbox that I just set up with all of my inbox mail from seven days.
[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:45.100]  And that's the one I try to zero out. And then you know, because I've got 10s of thousands
[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:51.360]  of other unread emails from 1015 years. But but for the most part, you know, I consider
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:56.860]  my inbox empty if my seven days of email, smart mailboxes empty. Well, you can't do
[02:38:56.860 --> 02:39:02.220]  it on an iPad. Smart albums and photos also use those it's it's they have the powers
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.820]  there right things there. Why can't we? And it doesn't Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:11.220]  that is it's I mean, I will say that again, though is like what you know, what is an iPad
[02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:17.400]  Pro for when it's so close to a Mac with similar specs, and it's, it's a different experience
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:22.620]  still because of the I mean, the touch element, the pencil capability, the portability, the
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:27.880]  built in cellular aspect, the fact that you can detach a keyboard at will or not use one
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:34.380]  at all. I mean, all of these things are differentiations. But iPad OS doesn't live up to Mac OS is what
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:40.180]  I mean, I'm not a full time iPad user. Partly because I found I'd rather be on a Mac. And
[02:39:40.180 --> 02:39:46.340]  I've got two different sizes of Macs basically, an iMac with an external five 5k iMac with
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:52.540]  an external 4k monitor, and laptop. And I switched between those because I did not find
[02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:59.440]  my iPad experience worthwhile enough to not have basically a laptop, a Mac laptop, right.
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:05.700]  That's why I find it so credible from people like Jason, and I forget who else is in my
[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:10.360]  queue has these complaints, but people who really do use it, like I'm more like you probably
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:15.920]  even less like, I find myself so much more productive on the Mac, it just it's just works
[02:40:15.920 --> 02:40:20.280]  with my brain. And I'm not saying this to put the iPad down. But I actually have found
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:25.840]  in the last year since they came out with the trackpad support in iPad and the magic
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:32.640]  keyboard in particular, I found that I would lose hours a day working on my iPad in the
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:36.360]  kitchen, because it was so much better and so much more useful for a lot of the stuff
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.180]  I wanted to do because I had this trackpad and a magic keyboard. And then I would think
[02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:44.080]  about it and think you know what, though, I just keep a lot of my work when I'm working
[02:40:44.080 --> 02:40:48.720]  on my iPad is sending things into a to do list to do when I get to my Mac. And if I
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:54.520]  just if I just spent the last 90 minutes on my Mac, I would have just done that. You know
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.940]  what I mean? It's like that. It's that trap that any to do system can fall into, where
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:03.840]  you feel like you're, you're I'm totally organized. I've got my whole life in this list, but it's
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:06.600]  like you're not actually doing it. You've just put everything into a list. And it's
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:11.120]  like, that's how I often feel when I spend too much time doing anything other than just
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:16.920]  reading on my iPad, which I do love for comfort and for just shifting my posture and going
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:23.300]  to a different room. But if I really try to do anything else, I find myself far more hamstrung,
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:27.440]  but I know other people feel otherwise. And they feel like it like their mind has been
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:33.900]  freed when they're on the iPad. But yet, you know, it, it, there's just so little headroom
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:39.200]  for power using on iPad, right? I mean, smart mailboxes are a perfect example. I'm sure
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:44.440]  whatever the percentage of all Apple customers who've ever created a smart mailbox on their
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:50.000]  Mac is very low, but it's a great feature. It's, you know, that helps. They've got the
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.680]  code. I mean, the code works on both platforms. They could just, and we know that right. And
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:42:01.220]  now that part of the frustration, I think that it's coming out by calling it the M one
[02:42:01.220 --> 02:42:05.780]  and not calling it the a 14 X it's just rubbing it in your face that you know, the device
[02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:14.080]  is capable of doing it very quickly, right? You can see how fast anyway, I don't know.
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.680]  I was going to talk to you about NFTs, but I'm out of energy. No way. Forget it. Here
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.840]  it is. So here's what my kids do before I go to bed. Like, you know, before they go
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:25.840]  to bed, uh, you know, my kids go to bed relatively early. We've, we've somehow managed to make
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:29.960]  that happen. And, uh, their trick is if they want to stay up later, they're like, dad,
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:36.520]  explain blockchain to us. All right, let's start with the, no, not here. I'll give you
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:40.880]  my one sentence thing. A non fungible token is like a post-it note that says, I owe you
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:50.760]  one art and it's, it's not, it's a signed post-it note. Uh, if you're sure, as long
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.160]  as you keep that as, as long as the post-it note doesn't fall off the refrigerator, you
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:43:01.760]  own that art. All right. All right. We squeezed it in. Glenn, it's always a pleasure to have
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:05.720]  you on the show. What do we want to, where do we want to send people to read more of
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:11.520]  your fine work? Oh gosh, let's see. Well, uh, been fun stuff over at macworld.com as
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.000]  usual. Remember when people used to get excited about CMSs, John, we talked about content
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.720]  management systems and that was the thing. There's a new, they switched over to WordPress
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:24.080]  over there and actually it's delightful because WordPress is now not bad. Um, so, uh, so easier
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:28.160]  to post articles there. Uh, so macworld.com, uh, I've still got some tiny type museums
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:33.600]  too. Uh, most of them are sold, but, uh, there's a handful of them. And where can people, where
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:40.160]  can people find the tiny type museum? I have type museum, tinytypemuseum.com. I have one.
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:44.800]  I was just looking at it. Uh, you technically got, you technically got number one, you know,
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:50.840]  really? Yeah. I was, I, you got the one, I mean, so they're not numbers. One of a hundred
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:56.120]  ish. Like there's a, I had this, there's a shipping issue, right? So I figured we had
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:01.000]  to make a, the, my collaborator who made the wooden cases, which are amazing. We had to
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:04.080]  make a little more than a hundred in case something went wrong. Right. And she was going
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:08.040]  to get one. I have a couple and so there's a few above a hundred, but we were like, what
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.160]  if something goes wrong in shipping? It seems like it's really likely. So if someone's museum
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:16.920]  was destroyed, they were insured. But I'm like, I'm not going to just say, sorry, I'm
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:21.840]  giving you your money back. That seems horrible. So we made some extras. So we have, it's technically
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:28.520]  an edition of 100 and then we have just a handful more and I've shipped, uh, 90, well,
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:33.520]  25 of them so far sold and a couple of people for reasons that are unknown to me, it gave
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:38.120]  me money and have not given me their address after two years. That's their prerogative.
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:43.320]  Um, anyway, so there's a handful, like once I've shipped a hundred or sold a hundred that
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:46.000]  I've got a handful more, but anyway, there's only like a, I don't know, there's like a
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.560]  handful left in the world. Like, uh, like nine, probably the most that I could ever
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:55.480]  sell at this point. I got it. For the first time in my life, I have an office, home office
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:45:01.120]  with nice built in shelves. And, uh, the tiny type museum has a prominent space of honor.
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:08.320]  Oh, that's nice. I'll give you a G right or a J letter. This is one of the, one of the
[02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:11.800]  bonuses is if you tell me your initials, which people have done, I've tried to find some
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:17.000]  nice wooden type there. I got a piece, you know, people would type. It's like, I'm sorry,
[02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:21.720]  I think I got a G. If wood type is, um, I think I have some nice G's as you can imagine
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.600]  with my name. Um, wood type is this amazing thing cause it was really made mostly from
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:30.800]  the mid 1800s to like 1980s, but mostly in kind of this one century period. And it's
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:34.080]  just all kind of jumbled up. Some people have preserved collections and some stuff was just
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:38.720]  thrown away or used for firewood. And, um, so you go on eBay and you can buy mixed lots
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:42.520]  of it. And so I bought tons of it in order to have good sets to send people and examples
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:47.000]  and whatever. And digging through one piece and some wood type is stamped with a metal
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  stamp on the side with the foundry. And it's, I get this one piece, it's a lowercase umlauted
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.600]  U and I look up the code or the name because there's people who do this thing and they
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:00.820]  research, you can find all the stamps of every wooden type company, including the different
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:07.200]  periods. And I'm like, Oh, this piece of type was made in 1869 in Geneva. And there's something,
[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:09.760]  I don't know, so weird. And it looks just like a piece of the type I have here that
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:15.760]  was made probably in like 1950 in Wisconsin. And anyway, there's just something so wonderful
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:20.960]  about that where it's like this ordinary objects like this is 150 years old. Well, that's,
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:24.600]  that's really cool. It looks great. It's held up. It's doesn't, it didn't get outdated.
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:26.640]  Don't install any new firmware. It's just to you.
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:30.520]  All right. Well, anybody who wants one, I can, I can vouch for it. It is. It's also
[02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:34.800]  a sort of thing. It's not for everybody, but if you think it's for you, it is for you because
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.040]  it is exactly what you think it is. And it's just delightful little package of this little
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:44.560]  hero set of it was given as a gift to more people than I would have expected. And a few
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:50.200]  people donated it to their universities or bottom for university teaching collections.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:55.340]  The other thing I always appreciate is a take control books publishes all my technical books.
[02:46:55.340 --> 02:47:00.200]  And so we did this M series book because I was writing a book about securing your Mac.
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:03.780]  We updated a book that was a few years old and dug into all the new security stuff and
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:08.320]  kind of the new sort of Apple. Apple is doing so much physical security of devices. Now
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:13.880]  they have to kind of rethink their whole, whole orientation towards security.
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:19.320]  The M series book is, I would really, really recommend it. I love it. It's very kind of
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:24.000]  the take control people. I think I've somehow been lifetime into a, like new books come
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:29.340]  out and I just get them, but I read that one and it's so interesting because as a long
[02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:33.560]  time, and I'm sure this applies to so many people who listen to my show as a long time
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:41.120]  Mac user, everything I know about how to troubleshoot a Mac is out the door. It is all new key combinations.
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:48.480]  It is, it's, it's all been rethought and all for the better, but it, there's an awful,
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:51.320]  you should read the book because there's an awful lot of, and cause it's the sort of stuff
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:53.880]  you want to know before you need to know it.
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:57.960]  Yeah. And I wrote this cause it was doing the securing book in like January or December,
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:01.880]  January. And I kept coming up with stuff that was like, Oh, but not in the M1. Oh, but not
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:06.480]  in the M1. I'm like, Oh, there's a book worth of M1 stuff. Tell me if you come across this
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:09.800]  because it's the weirdest one is I'm digging around and you know, Howard Oakley who writes
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:15.200]  Eclectic Light is his website. Howard is the nicest person. It turns out how a lot of incredibly
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.040]  pleasant interactions with him lately. And he's, he's such a knowledgeable person, generous
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:23.520]  with his information. And I'm not sure anybody else in the world outside of Apple seems to
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.560]  know or document as much about APFS and the M1 and boot modes than he does. So he's the
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:36.320]  place I go to. Anyway, I'm, I'm digging around, I think in the app platform security guide
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:41.000]  and I'm reading Howard's site and I'm like, wait, what's fallback recovery OS. So, you
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.960]  know, Apple's now sort of calling Mac OS recovery is now recovery OS. That's sort of the term
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:49.960]  only used in the platform security guide. So in your M1, there's not just a recovery
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:55.400]  mode recovery partition. If that fails, there's a backup one that you can trigger, but it's
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:58.440]  kind of like the AB things on a spaceship. You know, they send probes off and there's
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:03.440]  two, you know, just in case one of the computers fails. So we actually have two recovery partitions
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:08.720]  in case one gets corrupted. You've got a backup one that has to, has slightly different features,
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.820]  but it'll, it'll work seamlessly. And if it boots, it'll actually restore the other one
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:17.240]  and then switch and become the main one. And you're like, what the, you know, this is just
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:22.960]  hidden in the M1s and there's very few circumstances hopefully under which you'd have to deal with
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:27.880]  it. And then Apple had that whole thing about reviving or restoring firmware, which is available
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:34.840]  in Intel's. I had no idea about it. Intel Macs, it's just as weird on M1s, but anyway,
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:40.560]  it's, it's a great journey. And but even things like you're talking about keyboard shortcuts
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:46.320]  for starting up the boot modes on a M1, there's like five boot modes and there's like 14 on
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:50.880]  Intel machines. That's insane. But it's great cause it's less do you have to deal with.
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.320]  But that's what you need to do. And I love to take control books, which is great, but
[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:59.720]  much like my, my comment about modern streaming television show needing to have episodes of
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:04.320]  not of a set length. The one thing I love about take control books is that they're always
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.000]  of the length they need to be and no more. Whereas I know, you know, this as a long time
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.680]  book author, it used to be that, Oh, you know how people, you know how people buy a book
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:17.120]  when they need a computer book, they go into bookstore and they look for the thickest book
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:21.560]  with the subject on the, that they're looking for on the spine and figure that's the best
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:29.480]  book and buy it. And it was a Mac Bible sold. There was this race to have the most pages.
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:33.360]  And that's why, you know, your tiny type museum is on one side of my shelves on the other
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:37.120]  side or all of my old computer books, most of which are most of which look like phone
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  books.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:45.440]  Oh, it's sweet. Yeah. That's a, and just by the way, I am working on take control of cryptocurrency.
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:50.760]  You will get an NFT explanation eventually. This is, this is Joe and I, we realized, and
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:55.020]  I think the book, you know, I had a friend who was a colleague, worked across the hall
[02:50:55.020 --> 02:51:01.640]  of place I was at who, she was a home birth midwife and she eventually left midwifing
[02:51:01.640 --> 02:51:06.420]  because she realized she got so many people coming in who she felt were not qualified
[02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:10.260]  from a safety and health perspective to give birth at home that most of what she did was
[02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:14.680]  tell people, don't give birth at home. And she found that too depressing. So, she went
[02:51:14.680 --> 02:51:19.600]  to a different field and I'm like, this cryptocurrency book may actually wind up being a lot of reasons
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:23.680]  why you should never invest in cryptocurrency, but I'm going to be honest about it. And if
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:26.820]  you want to understand how it works, it's going to say, and then it's like, okay, with
[02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:31.560]  all of this in mind, here's how you can do it safely and intelligently and, and whatever.
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:34.240]  But as I go through it, I'm like, man, am I just going to write a book that's like,
[02:51:34.240 --> 02:51:36.200]  Hey, just don't do this. I don't think it'll do that.
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:39.420]  Did you see the story, a couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post had a story about some
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:46.800]  poor guy who, who had a bunch of Bitcoin and put it on, it put it on a USB device that's
[02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:53.440]  meant like a Bitcoin currency holder. And Bitcoin went up in value to like $600,000.
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:58.200]  And then he, he went to the app store and the, the, the context of the story is, Hey,
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:01.740]  you think you can trust the app store? Well, this guy went, the company who made this device
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:07.860]  that it's like for your self storage of your Bitcoin, they don't even have an app, but
[02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:11.840]  some scammers made an app with their company name. I don't know what it is, Trexor or something
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:18.440]  like that. So he thought it was legit. He, he put into it his backup key to his Bitcoin,
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:23.240]  which is like only supposed to be used in recovery if you lose the device and they'd
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:25.600]  stole all of his Bitcoin.
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:29.860]  I felt bad for the guy, but Josh centers told me this, Josh centers of tidbits who's looked
[02:52:29.860 --> 02:52:34.260]  into this and those devices. He said, that's the key that they tell you to never enter
[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:38.920]  anywhere for any reason. And he entered it into an app. So he was ripped off. He is the
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:42.920]  victim and I'm not blaming him, but he did use the key that they said, never do this
[02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:48.980]  with the key. And so he's, he still is a crime victim, but he, he, he did, he did do the
[02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:50.720]  thing you're not supposed to do.
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:54.860]  You're never, ever, ever supposed to do it, but he plugged it right in. But it's also
[02:52:54.860 --> 02:53:00.480]  the case that you're not, it's too complicated that this is why, this is why I don't like
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:05.960]  when you, we don't keep our checking accounts on USB devices in our home. You know, we go
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:13.520]  to a real bank, you know what I mean? Well, if you had cash, if you had $600,000 in, in
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:19.000]  a hundred dollar bills, you would do a much better job protecting it than, than this guy
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:23.640]  did with, you'd never act the way as, as loosey goosey with the Bitcoin. It'd be like, it's
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:29.800]  like if he kept $600,000 in cash in a mailbox in front of his house and then, you know,
[02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:33.520]  just had like a padlock and then somebody was like, well, I need to do service on this.
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:36.280]  Can I have the key to the padlock? He's like, here you go.
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:39.640]  You know, here's the one thing about Bitcoin is there are billions, maybe tens of billions
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:43.800]  of dollars at the current exchange rate that are lost forever because they're locked up.
[02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:47.560]  I met this guy years ago and I was writing a Bitcoin story for The Economist. I'm sure
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:51.760]  we talked about it in my Bitcoin episode with you a few years ago. And it turned out he
[02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:56.920]  was generating in his little apartment because of a fluke and timing about equipment availability,
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:54:00.680]  like some significant single digit percentage of all Bitcoin mined in the country or in
[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:04.200]  the world, sorry, was being generated in that guy's apartment for just a brief period of
[02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:08.160]  time. And he said, oh yeah, I've got these hard drives, you know, since my cold storage
[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:12.480]  and they've died and I can't recover the data off them. And they had like, I don't remember
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:16.480]  how many Bitcoins it was, but by today's dollars, it might've been hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:20.960]  today. And I'm just thinking about, it's such a weird thing. It's like, well, I put my money
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:26.620]  in a flammable bag and if I don't enter the key right, then the bag catches on fire and
[02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:30.560]  all the money's burned up forever. I don't think that's a good way to keep money.
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:34.760]  It's like the Bruce Schneier remark that, you know, that so many people think like the
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:38.600]  worst thing you could possibly do with an important password is write it down on a piece
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:43.160]  of paper because piece of paper, that seems terribly insecure. And Bruce Schneier's argument
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.720]  is no, we're actually very, very good at keeping, if you know you have important information
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.940]  on an important piece of paper, we're naturally evolved to know how to protect it and keep
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:57.360]  track of it and put it in, oh, this is where I put important pieces of paper and that's
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:01.640]  where it is and keep it safe. And it's almost certainly more secure than anything a lay
[02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:04.440]  person could ever do digitally, right?
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:06.000]  Totally, totally.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:10.800]  I remember there was a story a couple of months ago or maybe a year ago about people who've
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:16.820]  lost access to their Bitcoins. And there was one guy who had tens of millions, maybe more,
[02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:23.660]  maybe hundreds of millions and whatever contraption he had used to store them, limits the number
[02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:24.660]  of guesses he grabs.
[02:55:24.660 --> 02:55:26.420]  Oh, I read that. Yes.
[02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:31.880]  And he's like near, he's got like 10 guesses and he's used eight. And honest to God, I
[02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:38.520]  mean, it would drive anybody insane. I mean, I think I'm relatively very well balanced
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:44.640]  emotionally and mental health-wise. If that were me, I think they'd have to lock me up.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  I mean, that would be...
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:50.960]  They said, you're going to lose $20 million if you enter this code wrong. I mean, it's
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:51.960]  life changing.
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.480]  He sort of has some guesses, you know what I mean? Like he kind of thinks, you know what
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:01.080]  I mean? Like the way that a lot of us have certain combinations and ways that we make
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:04.440]  when you get to make your own password, which you really probably shouldn't do anymore.
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:11.880]  But you have some ideas about old passwords, and it's like, I don't know, did I use a zero
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:17.000]  instead of an O? Or did I use the three instead of the E?
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:20.360]  It's a terrifying thing. And we're reading these stories all the time. I mean, this is
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:23.800]  one of the... And we won't get into this right now, but it's one of the things that's weird
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:28.540]  about cryptocurrency is I think the total value of all that outstanding is valued at
[02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:32.640]  like almost $2 trillion now, I think. But it's a weird thing because it's not really.
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:38.240]  I mean, that's the exchange rate. So at some level, it's worth nothing, unlike fiat currency,
[02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:42.360]  which is backed by the full faith and credit of a government, where the government's going
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:45.240]  to demand your taxes in that money, and they're going to pay you in that money, and they're
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:49.000]  going to pay all their debts in that money and so forth. So there is some basis, whatever
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:52.840]  it is, of fiat currency. But it is that thing. It's like, you could have a run in the bank.
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:56.800]  It's like if everybody tried to cash out their Bitcoin at once, it's worth practically nothing.
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:01.640]  So it's this weird quantum superposition of your money's worth a huge amount of money
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.160]  and your Bitcoin's worth a huge amount of value if you can access it, and then if you
[02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:11.520]  can get it through an exchange system and retrieve it in a fungible form. But yeah,
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:16.320]  I feel like we're going to have a story every day about somebody who had one Bitcoin or
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:24.520]  fifty or whatever. The sushi guy, right? The guy got paid, he let people pay for sushi,
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.720]  and they were able to retire, I think, because they had so much Bitcoin left over.
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.600]  I've also read, I remember reading a story about somebody who, as a gimmick for the press,
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.840]  bought pizza with Bitcoin, and in hindsight, it's now, I don't know, like $5,000.
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:40.040]  Oh yeah, like $60,000 or $50,000, or something?
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:43.520]  Yeah, $60,000 in today's money. And he's like, well.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:48.640]  I got $40 in Bitcoin, I bought like $40 in Bitcoin several years ago and totally forgot
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:53.480]  about it, and it's gone, and I don't know if it was stolen or I trans-donated it, I
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:56.920]  probably donated it to somebody back then or whatever, but I'm like, well that would
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:00.960]  have been like $8,000 now, or whatever it was. I did the math when I bought it because
[02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:04.000]  I found the receipt, and I was like, well, you know, that's not life changing, but I'm
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:10.520]  still like, I had, this is, John, you know, I missed the domain name rush, I kind of missed
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:16.360]  that, like I was registering domain names in 1994, I think it was, and some of the domains
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:19.960]  I registered were later sold for vast amounts of money, I did not receive the vast amounts,
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.760]  I received some commissions, I got a little money out of the domain thing, but I'm like,
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:28.760]  Bitcoin, that's the one I missed, Bitcoin, I should have bought like 10 Bitcoin for $10
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:30.120]  and never sold them, right?
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:33.640]  Yeah, I kind of regret that I didn't either. Just a little, you know, just put, I don't
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:34.640]  know, put a couple hundred bucks in.
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:37.480]  The next one, we'll get the next one for sure.
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:43.720]  All right, Glenn, it's good talking to you. Oh, really, really, really did enjoy it. Anyway,
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:48.120]  I would be remiss if I didn't tell people about your Twitter and also warn them about
[02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:49.120]  your
[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:50.120]  Double-edged sword.
[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:58.200]  Glenn F, with two Ns, Glenn F on Twitter, but be ready. It's a lot. Anyway.
[02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:08.960]  Glenn F, I backed off.
