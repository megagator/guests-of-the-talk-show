[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  So we spent like pretty much the whole beginning of the week together, and it started, we had
[00:06.160 --> 00:14.800]  a wonderful dinner on Monday night with our mutual friend Michael Lop, where you two wanted
[00:14.800 --> 00:18.760]  to talk entirely about Destiny 2, but all I wanted to talk about is how is Apple going
[00:18.760 --> 00:27.440]  to pronounce the X in the name iPhone X, because the name had leaked, and we had one and only
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.800]  one reason why they might call it iPhone X, which was that we're 10 years away from the
[00:31.800 --> 00:39.160]  original iPhone, and we came up with a list of like 15 good reasons why they would pronounce
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.020]  it iPhone X, and we just left the dinner like, well, that's a settled deal. It'll be iPhone
[00:44.020 --> 00:51.480]  X. And then I stayed in the city, could not get a hotel. It's bizarre that I could not
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.600]  get a hotel near Cupertino, so I just stayed in the city, and you swung by kindly and picked
[00:56.600 --> 01:01.580]  me up the morning of the event, and we drove down, and as we're driving from San Francisco
[01:01.580 --> 01:07.040]  to Cupertino, I said, you know what? I'm going to write that up. And right there in the front
[01:07.040 --> 01:15.480]  seat of Matthew's car, I wrote the article I headlined X-Man, explaining exactly in predicting,
[01:15.480 --> 01:19.460]  you know, only an hour before the event, two hours before the event, exactly why I thought
[01:19.460 --> 01:27.400]  they were going to call it iPhone X. Well, you know, I was I was there to be the voice
[01:27.400 --> 01:33.240]  of reason, and I just didn't speak up. Honestly, I bought in, though, I got into your reasoning.
[01:33.240 --> 01:38.960]  No, we were all convinced. I was the one who started dinner convinced and and you and Michael
[01:38.960 --> 01:42.720]  were both like, I could see it both ways. And by the end of it, and half of the reasons
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.840]  I came up with, I stole from you and Michael. Like, it wasn't just even by reasons like,
[01:47.840 --> 01:51.680]  right, right. I'll take the heat for it. But quite frankly, it should have been like crowd
[01:51.680 --> 01:57.120]  sourced. It should have been a three byline article. Me, you and Michael eating prime
[01:57.120 --> 02:05.120]  live deciding. Yeah. Oh, my God. Now I'm hungry. Yeah, I still I still am. I'm fine with it.
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.960]  You know, I'm fine with the logic behind the reasons. But I think in the end, you I told
[02:11.960 --> 02:15.200]  somebody this the other day about something different. It was something some of the decision
[02:15.200 --> 02:19.640]  that Apple had made or was going to make or whatever. I said, you know, in the end, there
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.240]  can be like lots of logical reasons why X or Y or Z that would be the choice that they
[02:25.240 --> 02:31.560]  would make. But when it boils down to it, if you go back, write up a scorecard of all
[02:31.560 --> 02:35.920]  the decisions they've ever made and all of the things, you know, of the the pre thinking
[02:35.920 --> 02:39.920]  that everybody put into. Oh, what will they do? What will they do? In the end, they typically
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.920]  do the most absolutely the most obvious thing. The most obvious thing is the thing that they
[02:44.920 --> 02:49.840]  do because they're working at such enormous scale. That's what makes sense typically.
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.480]  You know, so iPhone 10 just. Yeah, the other one was iPhone eight. Why wouldn't we call
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.780]  this iPhone 10? You know, it's just like logical. So I will say this. I ran into Phil Schiller
[02:59.780 --> 03:09.160]  after the event and the first thing he said to me was, hey, John, sorry about the 10 thing.
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.860]  Which blew my mind because I literally published it like 90 minutes before the thing. So how
[03:14.860 --> 03:20.080]  could he possibly have been aware of it? Because you'd think he would be like in like concentration
[03:20.080 --> 03:25.320]  mode, a little busy, you would think. And he laughed and I laughed. And he and then
[03:25.320 --> 03:32.760]  all he said was, we spent a lot of time on the name and ended up back at one. Right.
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.720]  I think you're exactly right. I feel like they probably did spend a lot of time and
[03:37.720 --> 03:44.440]  they ended up at the most obvious thing possible. So the other day was pretty good. So, yeah,
[03:44.440 --> 03:48.920]  you published it and we go, we're so harried. I mean, you and I are harried, right? Trying
[03:48.920 --> 03:55.240]  to find the place and get in because it's brand new. We're running into a literal blockade
[03:55.240 --> 04:02.160]  because they have blocked an entire street off. And I got a rash of crap from Apple people
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.000]  about using Waze instead of Apple Maps because they said that Apple Maps would have directed
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.300]  me appropriately. This is too good of a story. So we've plugged the address in and you and
[04:12.300 --> 04:18.360]  I both, you know, when you get an invitation to one of these events, somebody in Apple
[04:18.360 --> 04:23.880]  PR emails you, you know, there's somebody who's, who's like your point person and your,
[04:23.880 --> 04:28.540]  Hey, if you have any questions, contact me person. And it varies by event, but that way
[04:28.540 --> 04:32.360]  everybody's taken care of. And, and there's tons, I don't know how many people there are
[04:32.360 --> 04:39.500]  in Apple PR, but there's, it's, you know, pretty large group. And you and I both had
[04:39.500 --> 04:45.040]  emails that, that seemed to imply an unusual amount of familiarity. It was just like, Hey,
[04:45.040 --> 04:50.840]  we'll see you there. You've got briefings the next day after the event or after the
[04:50.840 --> 04:56.800]  event at, you know, 11, 15 and we'll meet you at the cafe. And it's like, well, where's
[04:56.800 --> 05:02.720]  the cafe? Oh yes, the cafe. Got it. I have no idea. It just implied an unusual amount
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.800]  of familiarity with a campus that we obviously have no familiarity with, but they did give
[05:06.800 --> 05:12.040]  us a street address and, and you plugged it in to, to ways and, and we're going there.
[05:12.040 --> 05:18.280]  And, and like you said, we literally, they had the street closed and it was obvious that
[05:18.280 --> 05:23.120]  it was Apple people who had closed it. They're, they're, they're Manning it. And we're looking
[05:23.120 --> 05:28.120]  at the mixture of people, but some of them were definitely wearing that like white shirt,
[05:28.120 --> 05:35.320]  black pant, Apple security, traffic control. And from within the car we gave like a, Hey,
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.240]  where do we do? And, and there was a woman who gave us sort of a, you can either go left
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.440]  or right. And so we made a right and next thing you know, we're like, it was like, it
[05:43.440 --> 05:48.800]  was the wildly coyote thing. Like, you know, the two arms cross pointing either direction,
[05:48.800 --> 05:56.000]  you know, like Alice in Wonderland, just your cat, you can go this way. So we made a choice
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.720]  and we ended up behind. It was not the main building. It was, it's, it's some of these
[06:00.720 --> 06:05.320]  peripheral buildings that it's obviously part of campus, obviously new construction. And
[06:05.320 --> 06:10.040]  the ones we were behind were obviously unfinished. It was these buildings that run finished.
[06:10.040 --> 06:14.840]  There was a garage back there, but we were a hundred percent certain that this is not
[06:14.840 --> 06:18.800]  where we were supposed to go. And so we both made some texts, placed some texts, like to,
[06:18.800 --> 06:25.760]  to PR people like, Hey, what are we supposed to do? So we got a call from Apple PR and,
[06:25.760 --> 06:29.360]  and they were like, you got to go around the block. And they were like, are you, what are
[06:29.360 --> 06:34.120]  you using Google maps? And I thought it was a joke from Apple. Like I thought it was like,
[06:34.120 --> 06:39.220]  Oh, that's just the type of joke. Yeah. What are you using Google maps to get real? Yeah.
[06:39.220 --> 06:46.100]  But the truth is that Apple had a seated, I guess in some way, Apple maps with where
[06:46.100 --> 06:52.720]  if you plugged the address of that they gave us in, it was like 10, 600 ton, 10 towel drive.
[06:52.720 --> 06:57.000]  It would give you the exact right directions to get there. And Google maps literally read
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.120]  you led you right into the, the, the blockade. So it really was the, and it kind of reveals
[07:03.120 --> 07:09.800]  the thinking at Apple where, where they're so on, you know, the, they, it just didn't
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.040]  even occur to them that people wouldn't be using Apple maps. Right. Right. Like, why
[07:15.040 --> 07:20.480]  are you lost? Obviously you're using our first party mapping application. We spent billions
[07:20.480 --> 07:24.640]  of dollars to develop and that we, why wouldn't you? Right. And that we literally spent time
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.320]  before the event, like routing people around it. Cause you and I went back the next day
[07:29.320 --> 07:34.880]  and the next day even Apple maps led us that way. Like they, they literally seemingly on,
[07:34.880 --> 07:38.760]  on the day of the event, they changed Apple maps, driving directions to get you around
[07:38.760 --> 07:42.320]  the street blockade that they set up for one day. Everybody ended up on the right side
[07:42.320 --> 07:45.960]  of the blockade to get directions and park appropriately and all that, which was fine.
[07:45.960 --> 07:49.880]  We literally had to go around Apple park. We drove around the perimeter of Apple park
[07:49.880 --> 07:53.400]  and ended up in the right spot, but it was just one of those things where you go, Oh
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.240]  yeah, they make the map. They can just make the map point wherever they want. Right. So
[07:57.240 --> 08:01.920]  literally instead of like sending us those explicit directions in the email, they just
[08:01.920 --> 08:06.040]  presumed that we'd be using Apple maps and they just put it into Apple maps, which I
[08:06.040 --> 08:14.680]  found incredibly amusing. Yeah. And then it, and I just got, I just got razzed by it the
[08:14.680 --> 08:20.820]  entire day cause apparently they shared the information with everybody. The person I texted
[08:20.820 --> 08:25.280]  shared it with the whole PR team and everybody was very aware that I was using a Google product
[08:25.280 --> 08:30.960]  to try and navigate my way to Apple park. Right. Every single person at Apple PR who
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.160]  came up to you the rest of the day was like, what's wrong with you? Why do you use Google
[08:34.160 --> 08:40.200]  maps? I'm sure, I'm sure we're right up the chain. Right. They're, they're back channel
[08:40.200 --> 08:52.220]  must be, is, is quite efficient. Right. Yep. All right. So we do get there and it's effectively
[08:52.220 --> 08:55.400]  what they, where they wanted us to park was at the new visitor center and the visitor
[08:55.400 --> 09:04.040]  center is across the street from the, the, the block where the main building is the ring
[09:04.040 --> 09:10.400]  and the Steve jobs theater is also across that same street, but it is wholly separate.
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.160]  I mean, it's quite a, quite a distance from the main building. So yeah, the, the Steve
[09:16.160 --> 09:23.520]  jobs theater is inside the fence of the compound, right? You know, where Apple it's in Apple
[09:23.520 --> 09:28.040]  park, right? If you want to call Apple park, the literal park land that they built. And
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.160]  then the visitor center is across a small, you know, but street, you know, that, uh,
[09:34.160 --> 09:42.120]  that separates that park from ancillary buildings. Right. Uh, so it, it, it, it's fundamentally
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.560]  a different layout than infinite loop was where, you know, there's, there's now a store
[09:48.560 --> 09:52.120]  at infinite loop. There was always a sort of a company store, but it wasn't really,
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.600]  it was different than the Apple store, but now it's like a real Apple store. Um, but
[09:56.600 --> 10:02.200]  the Apple Apple park, right? Well, no, but the old campus at infinite loop, the store
[10:02.200 --> 10:08.120]  is literally in company store, right? Yeah. It's in, and always was in one of the buildings,
[10:08.120 --> 10:12.400]  you know, like if you went to infinite loop, the old campus, do you want it to see it?
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.080]  You were there in a building. I mean, obviously, you know, you weren't, there's no backdoor
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.840]  of the store where you could go into a secure area. You know, it's only like, you know,
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.280]  from the sidewalk, it's like parking lot sidewalk. Now you're in the store, but you were fundamentally
[10:26.280 --> 10:30.240]  in a building full of, you know, where there were Apple employees above you secretly working
[10:30.240 --> 10:37.720]  on Apple stuff. Whereas now the visitor center is, it's, it's contained. It's separated
[10:37.720 --> 10:43.280]  by an asphalt moat from anywhere that work is being done, right? There is no chance of
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.440]  contamination. And, and even with the, I wonder if they'll close the other one. I wonder if
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.600]  they'll close the other store. I don't know. That's a very good question. I would guess
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.680]  that this store is, is nice. It's a broad open layout with the tall glass walls, just
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.240]  like a new design Apple store. And the other one is not, you know, they kind of updated
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.680]  it recently, but not, it's not crazy update. Yeah, I think that they probably will. Right.
[11:07.680 --> 11:12.040]  But maybe they'll keep them both open for a bit, but I would guess that they'll close
[11:12.040 --> 11:18.920]  the other one and, and, and sort of, uh, it's a good question. Cause they're obviously infinite
[11:18.920 --> 11:22.920]  loop is staying occupied. They need all of the off. Then, you know, they need all of
[11:22.920 --> 11:28.480]  the space. Uh, yeah, they're already full. Yeah. You know, they're not moving from infinite
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.320]  loop to Apple park. They're just sort of like, um, you know, they're, they're like bulged
[11:33.320 --> 11:37.560]  into their current office space and they're just sort of like, you know, let out the excess
[11:37.560 --> 11:42.480]  up on desks and stuff. Yeah. Uh, I would guess that they will close the store at infinite
[11:42.480 --> 11:48.600]  loop. I don't know though. That's a good question. Um, it's definitely, and, and even with the
[11:48.600 --> 11:53.400]  press too. So it's, it's a, just the random riff raff who want to pay homage and come
[11:53.400 --> 12:00.560]  to Apple's headquarters and buy some t-shirts. Uh, you are not really in the real building
[12:00.560 --> 12:05.840]  now. It is an entirely self-contained building, like you said, across an asphalt mope. And
[12:05.840 --> 12:13.280]  even the theater, even the press are no longer like in the compound, like you can't complain
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.000]  about the theater that when we can talk about it in detail, the theater is exquisite and
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.560]  it is nice, but it is absolutely positively not, you know, uh, near the main building.
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.480]  No, it's a, it's the standing at the theater and looking towards the main building is the
[12:30.480 --> 12:38.440]  equivalent of looking across probably a football field's worth of grass and rolling. I would
[12:38.440 --> 12:42.640]  say you've just seen freshly seeded grass. I would say probably a couple of football
[12:42.640 --> 12:49.720]  fields. I think it's like a par four. Yeah. It's, it's at least like three or 400 yards.
[12:49.720 --> 12:54.240]  It is. It is still massive at that distance, which says something about the scale of the
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.200]  building. Yeah. And, and it is true, like the way that we drove in where we had to,
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.160]  we got turned around at this blockade and had to go around effectively. What we had
[13:01.160 --> 13:09.080]  to do is drive all the way around the Apple park all the way around and, and it, the vantage
[13:09.080 --> 13:13.840]  it it's, you know, it's a big building. Everybody knows it's a big building, but it's, it's
[13:13.840 --> 13:20.440]  really kind of stunning driving right by it. Just, just how massive it is. It really, it's,
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.360]  it's just, it's it, whether you like the way it looks or not, it's truly magnificent in
[13:26.360 --> 13:32.260]  terms of just the scale of it. Right. And I think we're used to seeing a lot of buildings
[13:32.260 --> 13:37.520]  that are vertical, especially in the city, right? So you, you're next to a big building
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.760]  in New York or, you know, even downtown San Francisco or whatever, and you look straight
[13:41.760 --> 13:45.960]  up and you're like, wow, look at that. It's a skyscraper. It's really tall. I mean, Salesforce
[13:45.960 --> 13:51.840]  tower in San Francisco is enormous and dominates the skyline now. But this is a different kind
[13:51.840 --> 13:58.020]  of scale because it's so broad and massive. It's just like a, there's a lot of mass there.
[13:58.020 --> 14:02.160]  It's very broad and something with a circular nature of it when you're up next to it, like
[14:02.160 --> 14:06.660]  when we're driving next to it and looking to our left at a point at which it was fairly
[14:06.660 --> 14:12.160]  close to the street, you know, because it kind of grazes the street on a couple of dimensions.
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.920]  And when you look that way, it curves away into the distance like it's heading towards
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.960]  the horizon, right? You know, the curve almost full, you know, gives you a greater sense
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.860]  of size and scale than if it's a squared off corner. You're like, oh, well, that's where
[14:25.860 --> 14:30.780]  it ends. Yeah, I literally no end in sight. I don't know what to compare it to because
[14:30.780 --> 14:35.000]  I've never seen a building. I've never seen anything like it. I really haven't. I've seen
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.440]  many towers like Epcot, like when you get close to Epcot, maybe or something like that.
[14:40.440 --> 14:44.680]  One of those types of buildings where it's a themed building that's built specifically
[14:44.680 --> 14:51.040]  to be massive. I don't know. It's just so it really seems almost it's so I've thought
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.000]  of this before, but now having seen it in perfect in person, it is. It's so funny that
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.200]  the old campus was named Infinite Loop, which is a programming pun. But my God, would Infinite
[15:03.200 --> 15:09.120]  Loop be a better and a perfect name for that building? Right. It's a literal infinite loop.
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.640]  When you're looking at it at Street View, right up against it, it really seems as though
[15:12.640 --> 15:18.040]  it just is infinite. It like you said, it just goes off into the horizon. It's like
[15:18.040 --> 15:24.420]  you can't even see where the it ends. It's truly magnificent. And that's as close as
[15:24.420 --> 15:28.840]  we got to the main building. I mean, that's as close as any anybody was able to get is
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.600]  outside the fence looking towards it. You know, the theater, obviously, quite a bit
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.280]  further away even. So that's as close as we got to see it. But it was pretty big. Yeah.
[15:38.280 --> 15:45.440]  In in recent years, and I do think it correlates directly. I'm like 99% sure it correlates
[15:45.440 --> 15:53.360]  directly to the Katie Cotton era and the Steve Dowling era of Apple PR, where in the Katie
[15:53.360 --> 16:00.000]  Cotton era, when when we had events at town hall at the old campus, you came in the front
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.960]  door, and then you went out the front door. And that was that was it. So you got it, you
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.440]  got to park in the Apple parking lot, and you got to walk on an Apple sidewalk. And
[16:10.440 --> 16:14.720]  you came in a door, and there was a lobby and you'd go in and even if you had briefings
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.080]  or something that you know, if you had meetings after the event that you're in the same building,
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.540]  and you just went up the stairs, and then the only door that you could leave by was
[16:22.540 --> 16:28.440]  the one that puts you back on the sidewalk, back in the parking lot. And in the last,
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.720]  I don't know, three years or so, when they've had events at town hall, they've let us in
[16:32.720 --> 16:38.640]  the main entrance. I forget which building it is. But instead of going in the building
[16:38.640 --> 16:43.080]  where town hall is, they let us in a nicer building. And then you can walk through the
[16:43.080 --> 16:50.280]  courtyard in the middle of the campus. And they'd have like some some food and coffee
[16:50.280 --> 16:56.680]  outdoors. And it was a nicer spread. And you felt like you were actually inside. But every
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.160]  step of the way, there were t shirted Apple employees like it's like it did feel more
[17:02.160 --> 17:09.000]  hospitable. But it was also very clear that every step of the way, I mean, literally,
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.600]  like every 10 feet, there was an Apple employee to make sure nobody wandered off.
[17:13.600 --> 17:19.240]  Right, right. Even though the buildings are access controlled, there's a first line of
[17:19.240 --> 17:24.960]  defense, right? Just to make sure nobody even accidentally wanders off the path that was
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.240]  laid out for the outsiders to go from A to B, there will be none of that at the Apple
[17:30.240 --> 17:37.280]  Park.
[17:37.280 --> 17:44.040]  So the line of people that in Apple Park that were there to do roughly the same thing, you
[17:44.040 --> 17:48.980]  know, keep people moving and make sure they didn't wander off into the literally the woods
[17:48.980 --> 17:55.680]  where 9000 trees or whatever are planted. But they were there and maybe every 10 to
[17:55.680 --> 18:02.240]  15 feet. And they were very aggressive about saying hello and hoping you had a good day.
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.860]  And, you know, how are you enjoying everything? But literally every single person was doing
[18:06.860 --> 18:11.600]  it after a while. It's a little bit like, OK, oh, we're doing this again. OK, good.
[18:11.600 --> 18:16.160]  So I just started to go on the offense and I would just preemptively right before I crossed
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.240]  the threshold of attention, I would say, hey, how are you? How are you doing? They were
[18:21.240 --> 18:27.360]  a little like thrown off their script because, oh, fine. Yeah. I was like, please leave me.
[18:27.360 --> 18:32.600]  It's like a mace. They're going to mace them with kindness.
[18:32.600 --> 18:40.480]  So the Steve Jobs theater itself is truly magnificent. It's I don't have enough superlatives
[18:40.480 --> 18:48.240]  for at least aesthetically how pleasing a building it is, how striking it is. I guess
[18:48.240 --> 18:53.080]  I knew this. I mean, there's renderings of it, but then you see it. And I realized that
[18:53.080 --> 18:58.120]  carbon fiber is is a lightweight material. That's what makes it so interesting. And this
[18:58.120 --> 19:05.440]  is like the largest carbon fiber roof of any building in the world, apparently. But the
[19:05.440 --> 19:12.240]  lobby of the theater is is a circular pavilion, for lack of a better word, enclosed in glass
[19:12.240 --> 19:19.960]  with a carbon fiber roof. And there's literally no columns supporting the roof. It's it's
[19:19.960 --> 19:26.820]  wholly supported by the glass walls. And and when you realize I didn't really it wasn't
[19:26.820 --> 19:29.960]  as striking when we got there in the morning because we got there around eight thirty.
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.680]  It was like an hour and a half before the event and it was already jam packed. Like,
[19:34.680 --> 19:40.280]  you know, there were hundreds of people who were already there. And when you're in a room
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.320]  filled with people and there was people, there were people outside it on the sidewalk because
[19:44.320 --> 19:47.760]  that's where they had the food and coffee. When you're surrounded by that many people,
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.600]  you see the people. And it was only when we left in the afternoon after most of it was
[19:52.600 --> 19:57.800]  cleared out. And I took a really cool photo where there weren't even any people in the
[19:57.800 --> 20:02.360]  sight line of the of the camera anymore. When it was mostly empty is really when it was
[20:02.360 --> 20:08.460]  striking like, Holy hell, what is holding? What is holding this this roof up? It right.
[20:08.460 --> 20:12.800]  It's architecturally it's an engineering wise. It's it is a marvel.
[20:12.800 --> 20:17.560]  Yeah, when you're standing in the building, especially when you walk right in the doors,
[20:17.560 --> 20:21.880]  and nobody's in there, or come up the stairs, and nobody's in there, you know, the feeling
[20:21.880 --> 20:27.520]  of openness and, you know, outside in, obviously, it was the was the whole point of it. It's
[20:27.520 --> 20:32.480]  just it really is impactful. And the only thing that obstructs your sight line in any
[20:32.480 --> 20:38.000]  direction because there are no physical supports beyond the glass itself is the elevator. And
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.440]  that's like that comes up out of the floor. But even the stairwells are there's only like
[20:43.440 --> 20:46.900]  a slight wedge and then they just sink into the ground. You know, there's not like a big
[20:46.900 --> 20:52.360]  boxy like, Oh, here, here stairwell begins, you know, they're cut into the ground, so
[20:52.360 --> 20:54.480]  to speak. So it's it's quite interesting.
[20:54.480 --> 21:00.240]  Yeah, somebody commenting on my photo said it looks like the layer of a Bond villain.
[21:00.240 --> 21:06.240]  And it's truly it truly does. I mean, it's and the stairs really do it was sort of like
[21:06.240 --> 21:10.480]  when I first got there. It was like, where the hell are the stairs? I didn't even I couldn't
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.440]  even tell where they were. It's sort of a it's freaky almost. I don't know.
[21:16.440 --> 21:22.160]  Yeah, it's one of those buildings where and I'd like architecture a little bit and pay
[21:22.160 --> 21:25.840]  attention to it when I when I can when I'm traveling. And some of those buildings that
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.600]  you look at and you go, you know what, somebody's definitely going to use this in a movie, right?
[21:30.600 --> 21:35.000]  But Apple's not that company. They don't need people to use it in movies. So it probably
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.600]  will not get used in a movie. But it's one of those art or those pieces of architecture
[21:39.600 --> 21:47.200]  where you go, Oh, wow, some site site researcher would love this place. You'd be like, Oh,
[21:47.200 --> 21:50.680]  we could shoot a scene here. And yeah, it could definitely like slot into a Bond film
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.440]  like, oh, this is the entrance to the lair. Yeah.
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.640]  So we, you know, gets the time, you know, the word spreads that they're letting people
[22:00.640 --> 22:08.160]  in, it's time to go to send the staircase. The handrails to the staircase are literally
[22:08.160 --> 22:15.420]  carved out of the walls. It is, it feels like it's carved out of stone. It's not stone.
[22:15.420 --> 22:18.600]  It's it's some kind of artificial I forget the name of that. I found out the name of
[22:18.600 --> 22:23.720]  it. But it's, it's the same surface that's like an expensive kitchen countertop service
[22:23.720 --> 22:29.180]  surface. But that the effect of having them carved out of the wall, it feels like you're
[22:29.180 --> 22:35.480]  in that that temple in the Indiana Jones in the last crusade, you know, that's carved
[22:35.480 --> 22:40.720]  into the mountain, it really feels like the theater is carved into the ground. Not that
[22:40.720 --> 22:48.360]  it is an underground theater, but that it's carved out of, you know, a massive block of
[22:48.360 --> 22:53.680]  marble or something that that was on the site for millennia. It really is the effect that
[22:53.680 --> 23:01.880]  you get. And it's funny, like I've had a bunch of questions about the hidden hands on area
[23:01.880 --> 23:07.400]  where people are like they don't understand. They don't understand what we're saying when
[23:07.400 --> 23:12.940]  we say that there's this retractable door, but it doesn't look like something is hidden.
[23:12.940 --> 23:16.720]  It just looks like that's the way it's supposed to be when we went in. And then when the show
[23:16.720 --> 23:22.560]  was over, and we went back, the wall was gone. And there's the hands on area. But the bet
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.360]  the best expert, you know, exponent visual explanation I can think of is is Dan Fromer's
[23:27.360 --> 23:32.780]  photo essay at at Recode. He had before and after shots that I think show it about as
[23:32.780 --> 23:37.240]  well as it can be shown. So I will put a link to the show notes and add a link to it from
[23:37.240 --> 23:41.680]  during fireball earlier, but it is quite a thing.
[23:41.680 --> 23:50.000]  Yeah, and that area that, you know, display area that they had for the hands on stuff
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.960]  is completely hidden. And I think there were some architectural renderings or, you know,
[23:55.960 --> 24:01.240]  some plans or something at some point that, or maybe even early shots that somebody had
[24:01.240 --> 24:06.640]  posted to the internet a few weeks ago. And in those shots, it makes it look like there's
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.980]  a wall that retracts away, like, you know, kind of a slightly curved wall that maybe
[24:11.980 --> 24:17.760]  retracts left to right or splits or whatever. And then you're led into a separate room for
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.680]  the demo area. And people were wondering out loud, how are they going to hide that area?
[24:22.680 --> 24:27.060]  When you walk down the stairs and you come in? How are they going to make it so that
[24:27.060 --> 24:31.480]  you can't see what's in there? As you walk into the theater, because it literally shares
[24:31.480 --> 24:35.360]  the same space, you walk down the stairs, and through the doors into or through the
[24:35.360 --> 24:41.100]  opening into the theater, which is even further underground. And that area is right there,
[24:41.100 --> 24:44.840]  you know, you're boom, you walk into it. And so people were wondering, how are they going
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.680]  to obscure it. And of course, once you come down the stairs, we came down and it was immediately
[24:49.680 --> 24:55.640]  obvious the way they obscure it is that it's an entire cylinder. It's not just a wall,
[24:55.640 --> 25:01.600]  it's a cylinder that wraps all the way around the exhibition area, I think they call it,
[25:01.600 --> 25:07.760]  or exhibit area. And that exhibit area is completely closed off by a column of metal
[25:07.760 --> 25:14.360]  paneling that matches the paneling, of course, used above, in at least in its aesthetics.
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.280]  And that's it, you walk by this huge metal cylinder, and into the theater, but you get
[25:19.280 --> 25:24.480]  no glimpse of anything inside the cylinder when you walk by it, right, because this cylindrical
[25:24.480 --> 25:31.640]  wall, you know, that it's, I don't know how you would just, you know, it's sort of like
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.120]  an escalator is a bad comparison, but that, you know, that there's, I don't know, five
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.760]  or six foot wide panels, with, I guess, some kind of hinge between them, which is how it
[25:40.760 --> 25:48.440]  like rotates, you know. And but when it's hidden, you would when it's open, and the
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.320]  exhibit area is open, you would never think that it's possible that there's a wall that
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.120]  could slide out and hide it. And when it's hidden, you would never think there's a room
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.400]  behind there. It just looks like this is like, a big column that supports the lobby above
[26:01.400 --> 26:02.400]  us.
[26:02.400 --> 26:08.840]  Right, exactly. Like it was built, you know, built into the building and not meant to move
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.840]  at all.
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.720]  Yeah, it looks right both ways is what I'm trying to say. All right, and we go into the
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.480]  theater itself. And the theater itself is is just fantastic. Every single thing about
[26:22.480 --> 26:30.500]  it. The seats are like plush leather. They are comfortable. There is truly a generous
[26:30.500 --> 26:39.640]  amount of leg room between the rows. All of the back area. Every seat has power. We sat
[26:39.640 --> 26:45.400]  a little bit closer, like the back row of the front area, which was more like, like
[26:45.400 --> 26:49.560]  couch seating almost, right? It wasn't even like we had individual theater seats. It was
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.480]  sort of like, like, it was more like a bench, but it was so spacious that it's more like
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.760]  sitting on a sofa. It was kind of crazy comfortable, which is
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.960]  that yeah, it was it was it felt a lot like a car seat. It really did. It did. It felt
[27:04.960 --> 27:11.800]  like a luxurious, spacious bench seat of a luxury automobile. Now one that you want that
[27:11.800 --> 27:13.000]  you have a driver for.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.040]  Yeah, and they even had the armrests that that pop back into the seat, you know, so
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.340]  you can keep them all up. And then there's more room for seating. But if you have room
[27:22.340 --> 27:28.000]  and there's nobody next to you, there was like a big plush automobile style armrest
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.880]  that you can retract down from the seat. It was
[27:30.880 --> 27:39.000]  a little loop that you hook your finger through and pull down just like a back car seat. I
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.480]  pulled it down, but no cup holders. It definitely was a European car, not a not an American
[27:44.480 --> 27:45.480]  car.
[27:45.480 --> 27:49.560]  So the blueprints for all of this, I guess, have to be released publicly, I don't know,
[27:49.560 --> 27:53.420]  to get approval. So like, I'm sure Apple, if they could have would have, you know, kept
[27:53.420 --> 27:58.520]  everything even more secret. But the blueprints for this were already out and I had seen them.
[27:58.520 --> 28:04.840]  But I'm particularly terrible, I think, at looking at blueprints for a building and visualizing
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.760]  what it actually is like to be there. And when I saw the theater on blueprint, I thought,
[28:08.760 --> 28:12.600]  Well, that looks like it has an unusually low ceiling. And I was like, Well, I guess
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.760]  that's what happens when you build it underground. But that seems weird. But when you're in there,
[28:16.760 --> 28:22.320]  I mean, that ceiling is cavernous. It is it's like being in a cathedral. You know, my reading
[28:22.320 --> 28:30.780]  of the blueprint was obviously totally dipshit wrong. It's just a truly truly cavernous space.
[28:30.780 --> 28:35.700]  The lowest point is when you're walking through the short tunnel or whatever you want to call
[28:35.700 --> 28:41.140]  it that right transition area from the exhibit area to the theater itself is when I say low,
[28:41.140 --> 28:46.020]  it's like a 12 foot or whatever, you know, ceiling. That's the lowest point. And from
[28:46.020 --> 28:54.320]  there, you know, the the theater slopes down way down in a in a amphitheater style seating.
[28:54.320 --> 28:59.000]  So by the time you get to the bottom sections, the ceiling is quite high above you. Yeah.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.160]  And I can't remember off the top of my head, but I almost I'm almost positive. It's cut
[29:03.160 --> 29:07.560]  upwards as well. Yeah, I think so the top of the screen is, you know, they have projectors
[29:07.560 --> 29:11.460]  and all kinds of other stuff that they need to mount. And so I'm sure it goes upwards
[29:11.460 --> 29:18.620]  on the ceiling as well as you go towards the screens. Yeah. And I noticed that there's
[29:18.620 --> 29:28.360]  a lot less visual visually exposed, like stage lighting, like, they know what kind of shows
[29:28.360 --> 29:32.640]  they're going to put on there. So they don't really need like, like a lighting rig that
[29:32.640 --> 29:37.320]  could accommodate anything and everything. I don't know, or else they just spent I don't
[29:37.320 --> 29:43.200]  know that it seems like they hid a lot of the lighting stuff that you when you look
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.580]  up in a theater nowadays that you see, because it's like, what else are you going to do?
[29:47.580 --> 29:51.560]  It's up there. It's just like instead that even the even the ceiling of the theater was
[29:51.560 --> 30:01.360]  was cleaner, and more just simpler than than any theater I've seen before. Yeah, when you
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.440]  build a bespoke and you know exactly what it's going to be used for. I mean, theaters,
[30:05.440 --> 30:11.060]  remember, have to be multi purpose, they have to be music venues, and in true theaters,
[30:11.060 --> 30:15.000]  to support different kinds of lighting rigs. And, you know, the essentially something like
[30:15.000 --> 30:20.280]  a contact point, right? That's what these trusses are in the normal theater where you're
[30:20.280 --> 30:23.760]  like, hey, look, you've got 180 different possible contact points here that you can
[30:23.760 --> 30:28.800]  hang whatever you want from, you know, lights or strobes or, or speakers or whatever. And
[30:28.800 --> 30:33.640]  then that's what, you know, the grips that come along and get all that set up. But the
[30:33.640 --> 30:37.840]  in this theater, they know exactly precisely what it's going to be used for. So they probably
[30:37.840 --> 30:41.960]  just put in exactly what they needed and no more, you know, and it probably allowed them
[30:41.960 --> 30:46.920]  to build it directly in rather than having a universal rigging. Yeah, I was kind of curious
[30:46.920 --> 30:53.240]  what going into it, I was kind of curious what the the screen would look like, because
[30:53.240 --> 30:57.500]  they could do anything, it's their theater, they could make like some kind of wraparound
[30:57.500 --> 31:02.120]  screen, a curved screen takes up the whole front of the stage, they could put three screens
[31:02.120 --> 31:08.800]  up there, you know, one on the left one on the right one in the middle. And it again,
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.500]  like your your thing before, like your observation that usually they just do the simplest and
[31:13.500 --> 31:20.380]  most obvious thing possible is they just had one rectangular flat screen in the middle
[31:20.380 --> 31:26.200]  of the back of the stage. And it's just really, really fucking nice. Right? Like, yeah, what
[31:26.200 --> 31:31.040]  is the simplest and most obvious thing they could do? Just put a really nice fucking screen
[31:31.040 --> 31:36.200]  rectangular flat, right in the middle of the fucking stage. And it was magnificent. And
[31:36.200 --> 31:42.960]  the audio quality. I mean, we could it was crazy, right? Yeah, it was very good. It was
[31:42.960 --> 31:48.480]  very good. I mean, like, I've, I've listened to, I've seen movies, you know, like, they
[31:48.480 --> 31:53.040]  do this every once in a while, but Dolby Atmos will put on a presentation and say like, Hey,
[31:53.040 --> 31:56.320]  you know, we, we helped with the sound design on this movie, or we think this shows off
[31:56.320 --> 32:00.200]  our system really well, you can come check out our screening. There's some Dolby Atmos
[32:00.200 --> 32:05.720]  theater in San Francisco that people can go to. And that is obviously top shelf sound,
[32:05.720 --> 32:09.600]  you know, and I don't know if it was quite at most level, because it doesn't need to
[32:09.600 --> 32:15.120]  be necessarily a home theater or theater type setup. But it was close. It was really crisp,
[32:15.120 --> 32:19.840]  really booming. And when they have the, you know, segments with music, like the commercials,
[32:19.840 --> 32:25.560]  things like that, the ad spots that they had, with obviously, mostly music in those things.
[32:25.560 --> 32:29.520]  I definitely felt the rumble through my seat, it felt like there was some probably some
[32:29.520 --> 32:35.400]  subwoofers built in somewhere under the seats, it was it was good. The sonic aspect of it
[32:35.400 --> 32:40.360]  was really, really solid. I noticed that it was the first time since they've gone to high
[32:40.360 --> 32:44.860]  dynamic range displays where during the keynote, they didn't have to say now we can't show
[32:44.860 --> 32:50.020]  you this because the screen you can't show it. And instead they could, they could show
[32:50.020 --> 32:54.800]  you what it looks like, right? High dynamic range versus right, we're gonna switch over
[32:54.800 --> 33:00.920]  to our HDR top of the line projectors with 4k and all of the stuff and just show you
[33:00.920 --> 33:05.880]  it right here. Instead of going you'll just have to imagine you know that this looks better.
[33:05.880 --> 33:11.200]  I that's that's pricey. I would I would I don't even want to tell you how much money
[33:11.200 --> 33:17.820]  I would pay to see Star Wars Episode Eight in that in that theater, like to get a center
[33:17.820 --> 33:22.840]  anywhere. I don't care if I'm in the back row, but anywhere near the center in that
[33:22.840 --> 33:27.280]  theater was where I wanted is where I would love to see Star Wars Episode Eight because
[33:27.280 --> 33:32.720]  it is the nicest theater I've ever seen in my life. It is it's truly, truly magnificent.
[33:32.720 --> 33:36.940]  All right, let's take a break. And I'm going to thank our first sponsor. Now we can talk
[33:36.940 --> 33:45.120]  about what it should show the hands on area was. Yes, let's. All right, our first sponsor
[33:45.120 --> 33:53.680]  is Eero, E-E-R-O. Now Eero makes Wi Fi base stations, but they're not just like regular
[33:53.680 --> 33:57.880]  base stations, they create a mesh network in your house. And now they have their new
[33:57.880 --> 34:04.120]  second generation hardware. And it's even better than before. But it works with the
[34:04.120 --> 34:10.360]  first generation stuff if you already have it. Now, unlike other router companies, typically
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.740]  to get Wi Fi that goes through your whole house, they just make like routers that are
[34:13.740 --> 34:18.960]  even bigger or have bigger antennas or something like that. And instead, what Eero does is
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.880]  create a mesh network where you get like they're like the basic kit comes with I think three,
[34:23.880 --> 34:27.960]  and you have one that's like your main one, you plug it in your ear, that's plug it into
[34:27.960 --> 34:31.800]  your cable modem or wherever it is that you get your internet. And then you plug the other
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.840]  ones in around your house and their app, which is awesome. It just put the Eero app on your
[34:37.840 --> 34:42.760]  on your iPhone. Their app will even guide you and help you kind of strategize like where
[34:42.760 --> 34:49.620]  in your house you should put them to get like the best coverage throughout the house. Now
[34:49.620 --> 34:55.400]  the second generation hardware adds a third five gigahertz radio. And so now it's tri
[34:55.400 --> 35:00.460]  band and it's twice as fast as their first generation hardware. And their first generation
[35:00.460 --> 35:05.760]  hardware got rave reviews from everybody who used it. So it's even better now. But that
[35:05.760 --> 35:11.840]  third tri band helps them keep like saturate your whole house, whether your house is like
[35:11.840 --> 35:17.080]  wide, like you've got like a lot of area to cover or whether it's tall, and it has a lot
[35:17.080 --> 35:24.220]  of floors. Either way, Eero really helps saturate your home with really strong Wi Fi signal.
[35:24.220 --> 35:27.260]  And the thing is, it's not like Oh, well, if you have three of these set up, now you've
[35:27.260 --> 35:31.120]  got three networks and you're switching networks or something like that, like your devices,
[35:31.120 --> 35:35.560]  you just sign in to your network, and and like your phone or your MacBook or whatever
[35:35.560 --> 35:41.200]  it is that you're getting on a Wi Fi with it just connects to the nearest one automatically
[35:41.200 --> 35:47.480]  like Eero handles that it's just one network with one password. But with three, four, however
[35:47.480 --> 35:52.480]  many of the space stations, you know, the little things you need it, you don't have
[35:52.480 --> 35:57.320]  to worry about that. It just works. It's so super simple. And the hardware is really,
[35:57.320 --> 36:01.880]  really beautiful. It's so small, so simple, so elegant. It's not the sort of thing you're
[36:01.880 --> 36:05.320]  going to, you know, I have to like figure out a way to hide or something like that.
[36:05.320 --> 36:10.240]  It looks great. And the new ones, the new little extra ones, just plug into the socket,
[36:10.240 --> 36:14.440]  you don't even need like a cable. And they even, you know, like a nightlight and they
[36:14.440 --> 36:19.140]  even have a nightlight underneath to like illuminate the floor underneath them, which
[36:19.140 --> 36:23.760]  if you don't want, you can simply turn off. But it could not be easier could not be less
[36:23.760 --> 36:31.200]  visually, almost invisible. It's truly truly a great product. I've done the whole reason
[36:31.200 --> 36:36.160]  that I can connect to Matthew right now is through any row. It's really a great thing
[36:36.160 --> 36:43.400]  that's that's made the Wi Fi in my house so much better. So here's what you do. Go to

[37:10.060 --> 37:13.360]  them even if they weren't a sponsor of the show. It's really really one of the best products
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.480]  I've got in my house. So my thanks to them. Okay, hands on area after the show.
[37:19.480 --> 37:23.520]  My kid loves to pull out the pull out my ear on the wall, pull it out of the wall, because
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.960]  he can reach. Yeah, he can reach one of them is in the bathroom. And it has the nightlight
[37:27.960 --> 37:35.000]  on it. So he's like, ah, and he yanks it out. Part of my mesh goes down. Like dead. Dang
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.640]  it. Like, literally, my internet will get slower. I'm like, what happened? Oh, you know
[37:39.640 --> 37:45.480]  what they are? But they're adorable little things. I can see why he's drawn to it because
[37:45.480 --> 37:50.000]  it is sort of like, I don't know, it's sort of like the same industrial design is like
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.360]  Eve from Wally, you know, it's right. Just this sort of and it's light up, you know,
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.720]  and he can reach it all the things. It's got all the good things that he likes. It's light
[37:59.720 --> 38:07.080]  up, he can reach it. It comes apart. It's really nice to touch. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.920]  Hands on hands. All right. So the hands on area, I linked to a picture Brad Ellis link
[38:10.920 --> 38:18.200]  to where he observed that the tables for the hands on area are concentric with the walls,
[38:18.200 --> 38:23.680]  the round walls of the atrium of that hands on area, meaning that they have like the same
[38:23.680 --> 38:30.880]  center. And even the pads on the tables on which they laid out like the watches or the
[38:30.880 --> 38:34.860]  phones or whatever it is you're trying to get your hands on. We're concentric with the
[38:34.860 --> 38:41.320]  table, like custom tables, the wood grain is perfectly aligned with the the radius of
[38:41.320 --> 38:50.200]  the table. The pads are custom made. It truly was beautiful. And I would say it was at best
[38:50.200 --> 38:54.380]  half the size it needed to be to accommodate the number of people were there maybe maybe
[38:54.380 --> 39:01.920]  only one third of the size. Like each table every single thing doesn't matter. Like what
[39:01.920 --> 39:06.360]  was the least exciting product they announced? Probably maybe Apple TV. They didn't even
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.420]  have Apple TV set up. There was no Apple TV in the hands on area. So yeah, let's say let's
[39:11.420 --> 39:15.240]  say new watch bands, right? And most people love those. And the fashion people certainly
[39:15.240 --> 39:18.560]  made a beeline. Like I was near the watch band table at one point, they were like, you
[39:18.560 --> 39:21.520]  know, yeah, we could tell they were the fashion people because they actually were dressed
[39:21.520 --> 39:29.680]  nice, right? But I'm just being honest, right? They got a bunch of bloggers there and I don't
[39:29.680 --> 39:36.440]  know, sweat sweatpants, basically. But yeah, they they had them arranged around in a circle
[39:36.440 --> 39:44.400]  and even the the lower attention products, not the X or not the new iPhones, but the
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.920]  bands, you could not even get there was four deep away from even being able to touch it
[39:48.920 --> 39:56.520]  for an hour or more. I have I have vaguely not vaguely but I have complained about the
[39:56.520 --> 40:02.280]  scrum of hands on areas for a while now. And I realized that this is an incredibly privileged
[40:02.280 --> 40:11.240]  complaint. And I still feel I feel so happy. And I really am that I get invited to these
[40:11.240 --> 40:17.400]  events because 10 1520 even 20 years ago, I always used to think like someday I would
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.180]  love to be somebody who writes about this stuff and gets invited to be at these Apple
[40:21.180 --> 40:28.240]  keynotes, I would like to be there and cover this. And 10 years into being somebody who
[40:28.240 --> 40:33.080]  gets these invitations and goes there, I still appreciate it. And I realized that that there's
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.160]  tons, 1000s of people listening to us talk right now who in the back of their minds think
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.000]  boy, that would be cool if I got to be there. And it really was cool to be there. So file
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.520]  this complaint under it's a privilege to be there. And I'm really the overall experience
[40:46.520 --> 40:53.320]  was great. And the show is great. And everything was great. But the, you know, so I just keep
[40:53.320 --> 40:57.340]  that in mind when I complain about the hands on area, but effectively, the effect of these
[40:57.340 --> 41:02.960]  hands on areas has been going downhill for a while because of the need for so many people
[41:02.960 --> 41:08.120]  from so many publications to get video of the stuff, which takes up so much physical
[41:08.120 --> 41:14.920]  space because you've got a camera person and a, you know, for lack of a better word talent,
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.800]  handling it and trying to talk to them. And there's so much more jostling. And it's it's
[41:19.800 --> 41:25.240]  been like one or two deep around the tables for events for a while now. But to say, like
[41:25.240 --> 41:29.300]  you said, that this was three or four deep, it really was it. This was like an entirely
[41:29.300 --> 41:33.680]  different level where it was like four people deep around the table where you at least at
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.100]  previous events, it's like, Okay, I'm not even going to get literally, they call it
[41:37.100 --> 41:41.360]  the hands on area. I'm not actually I may not actually get to touch these things with
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.120]  my hands, but I'll at least get get to see them. You couldn't even get close enough to
[41:45.120 --> 41:51.100]  see this stuff. It was really. And then the funny thing is, then you'd run into Apple
[41:51.100 --> 41:55.180]  people afterwards. And they'd be like, isn't the hands on area beautiful? Isn't the hands
[41:55.180 --> 42:02.060]  on area beautiful? How about that hands on area? And it's sort of like, well, it is beautiful.
[42:02.060 --> 42:08.400]  But from our perspective, as people who actually would like to get our hands on these things.
[42:08.400 --> 42:16.760]  Right? It's the hands on area is great. At many things. One of those things is not actually
[42:16.760 --> 42:22.220]  allowing you to get your hands on. Right? It's like, one thing it doesn't do well. It's
[42:22.220 --> 42:27.260]  like having an exquisitely beautiful, truly beautiful, put it in architectural, the cover
[42:27.260 --> 42:33.740]  of Architectural Digest magazine restaurant, and you can't get a table. You know what I
[42:33.740 --> 42:37.980]  mean? It's like, well, it is beautiful. But I would invite everybody there and you just
[42:37.980 --> 42:43.060]  standing Yeah, three deep behind other people eating. Yeah. And yeah, you're, you're invited
[42:43.060 --> 42:52.340]  to go even you even get an invite to go but you don't get any food. And even like I get,
[42:52.340 --> 42:56.060]  there's a combination of factors. So a while back, I think it was a couple of years they
[42:56.060 --> 43:02.740]  started consolidating all of the other events worldwide into one event. So this kind of
[43:02.740 --> 43:07.860]  coincides with the larger venues like the Bill Graham and things like that. They basically
[43:07.860 --> 43:12.180]  I don't you remember, I'm sure that they used to have satellite events, they would have
[43:12.180 --> 43:16.980]  like the UK press would come to the Apple Store Regent Street or some other location
[43:16.980 --> 43:22.460]  and watch a live stream and then have their own hands on area. And so on and so forth,
[43:22.460 --> 43:26.160]  you know, at various permutations of that it wasn't always exactly that way. But there
[43:26.160 --> 43:31.340]  were these satellite events for foreign when I say foreign, I mean, press outside of the
[43:31.340 --> 43:36.960]  US. And they would go there and it made it so that a they couldn't fit anybody, everybody
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.220]  in the room in town hall, right? And then also be they didn't have to travel and they
[43:41.220 --> 43:46.200]  could just, you know, go locally and they would, it would capture more press that way.
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.380]  So they started consolidating for logistics reasons, I think, and messaging and all of
[43:50.380 --> 43:54.460]  that. And because they started, I think, seeding more units. Remember, there was that big surge
[43:54.460 --> 43:58.420]  in increase in seeding demo units and things like that.
[43:58.420 --> 44:02.820]  Well, I mean, famously, let's just look at it. I mean, if we want to talk about the 10
[44:02.820 --> 44:09.140]  year anniversary of the iPhone, the first iPhone was seeded to four people. Steven Levy,
[44:09.140 --> 44:15.060]  at the time was at Newsweek. David Pogue, who was at the Times, Walt Mossberg, who was
[44:15.060 --> 44:19.580]  then at the Wall Street Journal and Ed Begg at USA Today, who's the only one who's still
[44:19.580 --> 44:22.740]  at the same publication. Those were the only four people.
[44:22.740 --> 44:25.820]  I saw Ed at the event. Yeah, he was walking around.
[44:25.820 --> 44:30.560]  Those were the only four people who were seeded with the original iPhone. And I happen to
[44:30.560 --> 44:35.940]  know that each one of them had a personal engineer from the engineering team who was
[44:35.940 --> 44:43.740]  on call 24 hours a day. I know, I know somebody who was with a soldering gun at the ready.
[44:43.740 --> 44:48.580]  I know somebody who is one of those four people for one of those reviewers. And it was like
[44:48.580 --> 44:53.020]  the most nerve wracking experience of his life because it was more or less like if anything
[44:53.020 --> 45:01.940]  goes wrong with that fucking iPhone, you better fucking fix it. Oh, yeah. And there's no manual.
[45:01.940 --> 45:06.180]  So good luck. No repair manual. And all four reviews actually went off without
[45:06.180 --> 45:10.140]  a hitch and they were all gone. But still, that's a huge difference from the number of
[45:10.140 --> 45:14.540]  people who get seeded with review units. Right. So there you get a combination, like
[45:14.540 --> 45:19.100]  a perfect storm of all of that that ends up, the end result of it is that you have a ton
[45:19.100 --> 45:23.620]  of people there and a ton of people all mashing into the demo spaces. It doesn't matter whether
[45:23.620 --> 45:30.020]  it's at Bill Graham or Town Hall or wherever, you're still going to probably overload your
[45:30.020 --> 45:39.580]  demo space. That said, they did build this thing from scratch, knowing exactly how many
[45:39.580 --> 45:46.060]  seats they have in the theater and exactly what they are going to experience in terms
[45:46.060 --> 45:51.740]  of volume, crowd volume. Right. You know, and I look, I know that it's tough. I mean,
[45:51.740 --> 45:57.900]  I know, I know without a doubt, personal experience that like they get calls from all these people
[45:57.900 --> 46:01.620]  are like, oh, I need to get extra extra in or can you fit one more in and all this stuff.
[46:01.620 --> 46:05.840]  So I don't want to like I don't want to make it seem like they are the PR people are not
[46:05.840 --> 46:09.060]  doing their job. They're trying to do their job, which is get the most people possible
[46:09.060 --> 46:15.260]  to see these things, get the word out, et cetera. And they do. They're usually unflappable,
[46:15.260 --> 46:20.220]  very courteous, all of that, like very, you know, they they handle a lot of what I would
[46:20.220 --> 46:26.060]  really blow up at, you know, a lot of behavior by the guests, by Preston and other people
[46:26.060 --> 46:31.620]  and other guests. But they hit a lot of that with aplomb without naming, without naming
[46:31.620 --> 46:37.980]  any names. We've both heard some interesting stories about. Yeah. The requests that certain
[46:37.980 --> 46:44.140]  publications put in. Right. Right. Exactly. So, look, I want to give them all of that.
[46:44.140 --> 46:47.900]  You know what I mean? But it would have been it seems like that there would have been an
[46:47.900 --> 46:53.620]  anticipated issue as far as the design of the space goes that look, hey, these concentric
[46:53.620 --> 46:57.860]  rings, because this is essentially a big ring that follows the ring of the steel walls,
[46:57.860 --> 47:02.700]  which follows the ring of the stairwell and the ring of the. So it's gorgeous and incredibly
[47:02.700 --> 47:08.840]  like beautiful, empty. Right. When you see the space without the units in it, you know,
[47:08.840 --> 47:11.700]  because that's the only time I could see the space empty because everybody obviously is
[47:11.700 --> 47:16.260]  gone at that point. It's gorgeous. And it would probably to somebody who had laid it
[47:16.260 --> 47:20.220]  out and was looking at it the day before going, I can't wait till everybody gets to come here
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.300]  and see this. It would have been, you know, they would have been ecstatic because of how
[47:23.300 --> 47:27.780]  gorgeous it is. Right. I love that. I think I think it's logistically it was tough. I
[47:27.780 --> 47:34.620]  think it's, you know, they're we you and I both had briefings scheduled after the event
[47:34.620 --> 47:39.300]  and and the timing of which and such that it was convenient. It wasn't like I was asking
[47:39.300 --> 47:42.900]  you a huge favor to wait for me. You know, we both finished about the same time so we
[47:42.900 --> 47:47.420]  could drive back to the city together. But by the time we were done, the hands on area
[47:47.420 --> 47:51.740]  was taken down. So we couldn't you know, like when we came back from the briefing area,
[47:51.740 --> 47:57.180]  which was behind this thing, it wasn't like they were still out there and we could then,
[47:57.180 --> 48:00.680]  you know, play with all the stuff that was gone. But we could see what it looked like
[48:00.680 --> 48:06.380]  mostly empty. We saw Jaws was there doing a TV spot with somebody as we went up the
[48:06.380 --> 48:12.460]  stairs. It looks beautiful. It look when it's empty, it is stunning. But I think it's sort
[48:12.460 --> 48:18.660]  of it sort of speaks to, you know, the weak spot in Johnny Ives design aesthetic, which
[48:18.660 --> 48:25.220]  is that there are times where I mean, and to go back to a Steve Jobs quote, you know,
[48:25.220 --> 48:30.860]  that design is how it works, right? That so if design is what it looks like, it is truly
[48:30.860 --> 48:36.740]  is a magnificent exhibit area. But if design is how it works, it is actually a failure
[48:36.740 --> 48:42.380]  of an exhibit area because it was nowhere near nowhere near enough capacity. Because
[48:42.380 --> 48:47.980]  this concentric idea, this idea that the tables there'd be one sort of ring of tables laid
[48:47.980 --> 48:51.840]  out concentric with the walls is just not enough. It should have been laid out more
[48:51.840 --> 48:59.900]  like an Apple store with rectangular benches with some space between them. Mm hmm. Like
[48:59.900 --> 49:04.420]  an Apple store like layout. I remember too that the very nature of like a concentric
[49:04.420 --> 49:08.420]  ring means that you're going to squish people together who are on the inside. Mm hmm. So
[49:08.420 --> 49:12.140]  you know, it's actually tighter because you're walking into a ring of tables, right? And
[49:12.140 --> 49:15.340]  then there's a melee in there because some people are just in the center trying to get
[49:15.340 --> 49:19.060]  like there were literally people doing hits in the center of it. So you have like ABC
[49:19.060 --> 49:22.660]  or whatever set up in the center of the ring doing hits because that way they have the
[49:22.660 --> 49:26.700]  backdrop of like the products and people behind them and the theater behind them. And they
[49:26.700 --> 49:32.060]  were, you know, I mean, that was that creates its own chaos. And then in amongst that, yeah,
[49:32.060 --> 49:37.580]  you got all the bloggers with the sticks and the, you know, doing the selfie style stuff.
[49:37.580 --> 49:40.900]  And then you have the people with actual video people who are shooting over the shoulder
[49:40.900 --> 49:44.580]  and getting the hands ons and all of that stuff. So it's a mess, you know, and I don't
[49:44.580 --> 49:49.280]  know what the solution is, but it definitely was. Well, the school, I think to some people
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.780]  being able to get everything they needed. The solution is to scrap the ring idea. I
[49:53.780 --> 49:57.940]  mean, let the you know, the room is obviously already a circle, but scrap the ring for the
[49:57.940 --> 50:04.380]  tables and do an Apple store like rectangular layout and you'd get a lot more product on
[50:04.380 --> 50:08.940]  the floor. We spent you and I spent and as I mingled, you know, we did wasn't like we
[50:08.940 --> 50:13.020]  were attached at the hip the whole time. But most of the people I knew, we spent our time
[50:13.020 --> 50:17.540]  outside that ring because the inside of the ring, like you said, was was it was almost
[50:17.540 --> 50:21.100]  like a like it had gravity. You know, it was like once you were inside, I just kind of
[50:21.100 --> 50:31.420]  got sucked in. Yeah. And at one point, Tim Cook and Johnny came out to do, you know,
[50:31.420 --> 50:35.140]  some handshaking and photo ops and things like that, you know, because they always bring
[50:35.140 --> 50:38.660]  Tim out and Tim is like talks to some of the people at the tables and they shoot some video
[50:38.660 --> 50:43.020]  and all of that. And of course, once that happens, the melee ensues. You know, everybody
[50:43.020 --> 50:46.620]  wants to get a selfie with Tim and say hi. And he's very gracious about all that stuff.
[50:46.620 --> 50:52.900]  But to just to get him into the ring, they had to have like five or six people around
[50:52.900 --> 50:56.420]  him, like whatever you want to call them, bodyguards or handlers or whatever, just to
[50:56.420 --> 51:02.580]  like, you know, I hesitate to use the word because they weren't rude. It's just like,
[51:02.580 --> 51:05.740]  hey, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. We're going to get him in. And everybody, you know,
[51:05.740 --> 51:10.060]  is like, oh, OK, let me move. I remember trying to get their picture. They're also trying
[51:10.060 --> 51:14.420]  to get their selfie. They're they're dressed very casually, like in polo shirts. But I
[51:14.420 --> 51:18.860]  remember I was looking at him and I was like, you guys are I bet they're all former Navy
[51:18.860 --> 51:26.100]  SEALs. No doubt. All of the guys driving the carts were former cops. Yeah. All of the people
[51:26.100 --> 51:30.460]  driving you driving the press up and down the pathways and stuff. No. So I was doing
[51:30.460 --> 51:35.060]  I was doing a periscope. I was doing a periscope video outside the ring showing a group of
[51:35.060 --> 51:40.100]  people going up the elevator. Now, the elevator is for those of you who haven't been following
[51:40.100 --> 51:48.100]  the architecture of this place is sort of notable in so far as when you come into it
[51:48.100 --> 51:54.720]  on the in the lobby, it's facing one way and then it opens in the back. And rather than
[51:54.720 --> 52:01.060]  put two doors in the elevator car, the elevator actually descends in a sort of helix like
[52:01.060 --> 52:08.860]  thing so that it rotates 180 degrees as you descend and ascend. And the elevator shaft
[52:08.860 --> 52:14.940]  itself is, of course, made of glass. So you can see this from either upstairs or downstairs.
[52:14.940 --> 52:20.460]  You can you can watch it as it as it goes. So I'm shooting a periscope video of the elevator.
[52:20.460 --> 52:25.320]  And that's actually where the door was, where, like as I'm shooting this, it was actually
[52:25.320 --> 52:28.780]  for those who were like, I don't know, 600 people on my periscope, they got quite a nice
[52:28.780 --> 52:32.500]  surprise where I'm telling them I'm shooting the elevator. And then all of a sudden the
[52:32.500 --> 52:38.840]  door opens and Tim Cook, Johnny Ive and Laureen Powell jobs walk out of a door and right past
[52:38.840 --> 52:47.500]  me. People on the periscope are like, holy fucking shit. That was interesting. It was
[52:47.500 --> 52:52.220]  very interesting watching the people make space for them because it was it was not like
[52:52.220 --> 52:54.220]  it used to be.
[52:54.220 --> 53:00.260]  Yeah. And when it used to be, I remember very specifically, like the Yerba Buena Center,
[53:00.260 --> 53:05.580]  they had that outdoor separate exhibit area. You know, in other cases they may use for
[53:05.580 --> 53:10.000]  artwork or like they turn it into a gallery or another presentation space. But they used
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.060]  it for this exhibit space for the Apple event. And I remember like, you know, Tim walking
[53:14.060 --> 53:17.540]  around and kind of standing there and like, you know, Jim Dalrymple would talk to him
[53:17.540 --> 53:21.300]  or say hi, or, you know, somebody will come up or a handler would be standing next to
[53:21.300 --> 53:25.500]  him telling him something and then he would shoot a little little photo op thing. But
[53:25.500 --> 53:30.220]  it was just such a crush this time. It was just very like impossible.
[53:30.220 --> 53:37.220]  I remember back in the Steve Jobs era, you know, where Jobs would wander around the hands
[53:37.220 --> 53:46.260]  on area and it was just Jobs and Katie Cotton. And yeah, and and Katie would they never you
[53:46.260 --> 53:50.340]  know, it was, you know, they never stopped and talked to me, but I would watch them and
[53:50.340 --> 53:57.100]  I could see what it was was Katie would, you know, in a low voice, tell him exactly who
[53:57.100 --> 54:00.340]  he was about to meet, because Katie had like the, you know, jobs couldn't be bothered to
[54:00.340 --> 54:05.420]  remember who the fuck who was, but Katie did. Yeah. And so she would say, you know, hey,
[54:05.420 --> 54:09.060]  this is so and so from, you know, Wall Street Journal or, you know, this is, you know, and
[54:09.060 --> 54:11.700]  then he'd come up, go, Hey, how you doing? You know, what do you think? And that was
[54:11.700 --> 54:15.660]  that was always and Tim does that does the same thing. But Steve Jobs is question whenever
[54:15.660 --> 54:20.300]  he'd be, you know, and Katie would also help him make sure that he met, you know, the right
[54:20.300 --> 54:25.580]  people that he wasn't wasting time on, you know, people like me that he talked to David
[54:25.580 --> 54:30.500]  Bogan and talk to, you know, he didn't need to be reminded to Walt Mossberg is, for example.
[54:30.500 --> 54:34.940]  But yeah, his question was always, so what do you think? And he'd want to, you know,
[54:34.940 --> 54:39.980]  and you could tell he wanted to know, what did you think? Yeah, but it was getting filed
[54:39.980 --> 54:44.780]  away somewhere. It was literally though, just Steve Jobs and Katie cotton wandering around.
[54:44.780 --> 54:48.940]  And obviously, I mean, you know, people noticed that Steve Jobs was walking around there.
[54:48.940 --> 54:54.340]  You know, it was not like he wandered around unnoticed. But it was not like it. Nobody
[54:54.340 --> 54:58.940]  had to part the Red Sea for him physically. Yeah, you know, I was that is I was at the
[54:58.940 --> 55:02.540]  last event that he was at. And I do regret not just like saying hi, because I was, you
[55:02.540 --> 55:06.020]  know, right next to him, but he seemed busy. And I don't know, at the time, I mean, I'm
[55:06.020 --> 55:10.500]  trying to like juggle cameras and do my thing and all of that stuff. But I do regret not
[55:10.500 --> 55:15.180]  saying hi or whatever. But you I felt like I could have like, Hey, what's up? And with
[55:15.180 --> 55:19.940]  this, it was just like, Oh, man, the you know, they've got some some really tough work on
[55:19.940 --> 55:23.640]  their hands to get him in there. Yeah, let him talk to a couple of people who are looking
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.740]  at the table naturally, like the people are just organically next to him. Shoot a little
[55:27.740 --> 55:32.940]  over the shoulder stuff for ABC or whatever interview that he's there doing b roll for.
[55:32.940 --> 55:36.460]  And then they got it. They had to literally get him out after that. They just say, Okay,
[55:36.460 --> 55:41.220]  well, let's get out because it was creating even more of a congestion issues. Johnny hung
[55:41.220 --> 55:45.180]  around and when talk to stuff, but I think, you know, people were like, talk asking him
[55:45.180 --> 55:48.700]  what his watch was he was wearing and stuff like that. He hung out a little bit more.
[55:48.700 --> 55:53.260]  But with Tim, it was just impossible. And it was a byproduct of the space. Did you notice
[55:53.260 --> 55:56.860]  what watch he was wearing? I'll bet I'll bet he was wearing a ceramic. I think the ceramic
[55:56.860 --> 56:02.620]  is I would guess so. But I didn't. I didn't. I wasn't close enough to see Yeah. But yeah,
[56:02.620 --> 56:10.100]  I would guess so. I was talking to another guest that was their designer in at the time
[56:10.100 --> 56:13.940]  we were just chatting it up. And then it out of the blue, somebody's like test me on the
[56:13.940 --> 56:18.260]  shoulders like, Hey, could you just step this side for just a minute? Oh, just excuse us.
[56:18.260 --> 56:22.020]  Johnny's gonna get a shot for vogue. And so I had to step away. He said, the designer
[56:22.020 --> 56:28.820]  got their quick vogue shot. So in the shot in vogue, I'm just out of frame to the left.
[56:28.820 --> 56:36.980]  Not asked to participate. They get their shot. And then, you know, we could hear a discussion.
[56:36.980 --> 56:40.940]  You should have said then, do you want to get one with all three of us then? Oh, you
[56:40.940 --> 56:48.900]  could. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, exactly. What is he wearing? What are they wearing? What
[56:48.900 --> 56:56.220]  are the stars wearing? Story I heard was the last thing at last, I think it's the last
[56:56.220 --> 57:00.260]  remark I have to make about the theater. But when you go from the hands on area, and like
[57:00.260 --> 57:04.740]  you said, they're sort of like a little low ceiling. Feels like a tunnel almost, but like
[57:04.740 --> 57:09.020]  a little hallway between there and the actual theater itself. There's there's, and it's
[57:09.020 --> 57:14.960]  all stone. Everything on the walls is just stone. But then there's an engraved Steve
[57:14.960 --> 57:22.660]  Jobs theater above it. typeset in Helvetica, which I found slightly odd that it's not San
[57:22.660 --> 57:29.060]  Francisco. But it is obviously not a mistake, because the story I heard was that it was
[57:29.060 --> 57:34.420]  the third, third version of it. And that the first one was Johnny came down and looked
[57:34.420 --> 57:41.220]  at it and said, Nope, $50,000 in stone etching, rip it out, but another one in second one
[57:41.220 --> 57:48.220]  came in Nope, another 50 grand. Throw it out. And then the third one was put up and he was
[57:48.220 --> 57:54.840]  like, that's it. A kind of weird I did a little slightly weird to me that it's not San Francisco
[57:54.840 --> 58:01.720]  because almost everything else everywhere is all San Francisco, the software, the hardware,
[58:01.720 --> 58:05.220]  all the signage on campus, everything San Francisco, but the word Steve Jobs theater
[58:05.220 --> 58:12.100]  engraved into the thing are set in Helvetica. Oh, the other thing we should talk talk about
[58:12.100 --> 58:18.020]  is the parking garage. I got to figure out how to put these I'll try to put these in
[58:18.020 --> 58:23.040]  the show notes somehow. But we parked on level p one of the visitor center parking garage
[58:23.040 --> 58:27.560]  and there's p two the first day. Oh, p two the first day. Oh, p one was the second day
[58:27.560 --> 58:31.320]  though and that's the one where the mistake is where there's there's two elevators and
[58:31.320 --> 58:32.480]  they're not next to each other.
[58:32.480 --> 58:36.440]  Yeah. So if anybody's listening to this, we're going to tell you exactly where you could
[58:36.440 --> 58:39.440]  fix this issue.
[58:39.440 --> 58:43.120]  On level p one of the visitor center parking garage, there's two elevators. The elevators
[58:43.120 --> 58:47.640]  are facing each other. They're not side by side and there's only, you know, as you might
[58:47.640 --> 58:55.160]  expect, there's two buttons, one to go up, one to go down. And the one that's correct,
[58:55.160 --> 59:00.880]  the up and down buttons are about six inches above the one seam in the wall. And on the
[59:00.880 --> 59:01.880]  other one,
[59:01.880 --> 59:06.120]  there's a two tone wall, like two tones of concrete, right? There's a groove that separates
[59:06.120 --> 59:10.240]  the lighter concrete from the darker concrete. Very nice, you know, nice little concrete
[59:10.240 --> 59:11.240]  work there. Yeah.
[59:11.240 --> 59:17.080]  And on the facing elevator, the up and down button panel is was obviously misplaced by
[59:17.080 --> 59:23.800]  the workman and it actually crosses, crosses the seam between the concrete. And as you
[59:23.800 --> 59:28.560]  pointed out, there's even like, like tape underneath, right? Is it was it tape? What
[59:28.560 --> 59:29.560]  was that?
[59:29.560 --> 59:34.120]  It's like like blue, blue masking tape, right? We just yanked it off, right? Just finished.
[59:34.120 --> 59:38.760]  But they couldn't get the rest of the tape off because the no button panel was placed
[59:38.760 --> 59:46.760]  over the gap in the concrete. It is so obviously wrong. And we both couldn't stop laughing
[59:46.760 --> 59:50.840]  with the knowledge that it's proof that Johnny I've has never stepped foot on level p one
[59:50.840 --> 59:54.320]  of the visitor center parking garage.
[59:54.320 --> 59:58.240]  He has never seen this because if he saw this, he would have ripped it out. I really hope
[59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.360]  he does not. I don't think I really would be surprised if he listens to the show, but
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.160]  if he does, he's going to like pause it and go over there. He's going to be what the fuck
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.760]  are these guys talking about? And then he's going to go down there and see it. And he's
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.440]  going to lose his shit.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.960]  And you know, look, it's just, you know, junk happens when you're when you're building an
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.360]  enormous sprawling complex, things are going to slip through the cracks. It's just that
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.700]  they spend so much time building it and you have a person whose reputation is like nothing
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:32.320]  but but like, look, this scene, why the scene, you know, and then you look and there's an
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.240]  elevator buttons like eight inches too low. And not only that, it wasn't there was a blank
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.240]  wall and you're like, are they lower? I need to break out my ruler. It was a like there
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.720]  was a literal demarcation line that allowed you to see immediately that it was really,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:53.200]  really wrong. And it's and it's directly facing one where it's exactly right. Right, right.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.560]  Exactly. You just look left and right. It's like wrong. Right. I think I think you did
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.840]  like the invitation of what Johnny would do if you stayed in there like, what the hell
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:09.600]  is going on here? Am I taking crazy pills? But like that's I grew up finding stuff like
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.840]  that because my dad was that way. I mean, he's a fit and finish guy for a lot of years.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.920]  He did like interior decorating and and paint and plaster and all of that stuff. And so
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.160]  for him, like he'll walk into a room and instantly go like, oh, that wasn't cut in properly there.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.320]  And you're like, dang it. I thought I was finished in this room, you know, and I inherited
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:34.320]  that that thing. And so I was like, we've got the elevator like my the I feel the disturbance
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.960]  in the in the detail force where what's going on here. But yeah, that was good times. Really
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.760]  good. All right. Let me take another break here and we'll talk about the actual products
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.360]  that were introduced at the event. But I want to tell you about our next sponsor and it's
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:54.040]  our good friends at backblaze backblaze offers unlimited native backup for Mac and PC. No
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:01.320]  credit card required to start no risk and you get a 15 day trial at backblaze.com slash
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:09.320]  daring fireball. Here's the deal. You install backblaze on your Mac and it is great software.
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.100]  I'm not going to name names but there's competitors that have these weird Java based apps that
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:19.840]  are horrible and bloated and take up tons of RAM and have terrible user interface backblaze
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.640]  is just a nice system preferences panel. There are actual Mac software engineers used to
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.360]  work at Apple so they totally know what it means to write truly native Mac software and
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:37.120]  backblaze never in I've been using it for years never ever like like I keep activity
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.400]  monitor running on my Mac all the time because I'm a nerd. And if I see those levels go up
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.480]  and I'm like go over there and see what it is what's what's making my CPU go to too hard.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.560]  It is never backblaze like it's not the sort of thing where you need to sit there and like,
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.120]  oh, I'm going to do something I'm going to work right now I could better go turn turn
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.060]  it off so that it doesn't do a backup. It's like, I have no idea when backblaze does these
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:05.320]  backups because it's silent and efficient and it just works. It's just truly invisible.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:11.360]  And what it does is it backs up all of your stuff to their cloud backup service. Should
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.920]  it be your only backup? No way. I and they'll be the first ones to tell you that you should
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.480]  have local backups, you should use time machine. I use a product called super duper, which
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.160]  creates a clone a perfect cloneable image of my startup disk. So if anything ever goes
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:32.440]  wrong with my startup disk, I am never more than like one day's data away from just plugging
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.200]  in the external drive and I can boot from it. And there it is. But you should have backups
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.280]  off site, just in case something terrible happens. So maybe you get robbed. Maybe there's
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:51.280]  like a fire. Maybe the the pipe leaks in the ceiling above your office and soaks all of
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.260]  your computer equipment or something like that. There's all sorts of things that could
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.160]  go bad, where you're going to be like, boy, I really wish I had an offsite backup. Well,
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:04.200]  Mac plays is the offsite backup that you should use. I use it. I would tell you to use it
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.320]  even if they didn't sponsor the show. Just truly great. And here's the deal. You pay
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:15.000]  five bucks a month per Mac, and it'll back up everything on your Mac and any external
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.880]  drives connected to your Mac. And that's that's the only limit. And you're like, well, wait,
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:25.240]  not me. I've got like this giant movie collection on an external drive next to my Mac. Nope,
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.480]  no limits. If it's connected to your Mac, it all gets backed up. That's it. Five bucks
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:38.520]  a month. There's no catch. That's it. So go to backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball. They'll
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.720]  know you came from here. Download the free demo and you got 15 days to try it out and
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.660]  see if everything I just told you is true. So my thanks to Backblaze for their continuing
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:51.660]  support of Daring Fireball and the talk show. Great, great service. If you're not signed
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:57.280]  up yet, there's something wrong with you. Which which order? What order do you want
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.080]  to talk about the products? Do you want to talk to the order Apple Apple did them? Or
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:07.480]  do you want to go reverse? Because iPhone 10 is the is the hot shit.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.880]  I don't know. Let's go. Yeah, let's go reverse. Let's do what? Reverse school reverse. Okay.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.160]  Yeah. iPhone 10. Because I figured if we run out of time. Yeah. Yeah. Let's give short
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:29.480]  trip to retail. It's sort of as Apple events where they go a lot of great stuff happened,
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.880]  but we have to be things to talk about. So everything's going great. Okay. Does it make
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.240]  sense? I don't know that it makes sense to talk about iPhone 10 separately from iPhone
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.640]  eight. Because now I think we should talk about it both. Yeah, it's there's a lot of
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.140]  shared hardware and shared features and shared philosophies. I think for showmanship purposes,
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:53.360]  they introduced them separately, and did the one more thing and, and, you know, and they're
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:00.800]  obviously priced separately. But at a basic level, it's it's almost impressive how much
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:09.600]  of the internal new stuff that's in iPhone 10 is also in iPhone eight.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:17.360]  Yeah, almost everything a 11 bionic chip is, as far as we know, at this point, they're
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.140]  the same speed, you know, it's it and maybe there's I don't know, maybe there's a mega
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.120]  hertz difference, I don't know, or gigahertz, I guess at this point, but I would almost
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.600]  be surprised if there were but, you know, but the fact that the most impressive fact
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:38.160]  of the a 11 bionic chip is that the new performance controller that Apple has engineered now allows
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.280]  all six cores to run at the same time as opposed to previously and which a lot of you know,
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.640]  it's not unique to Apple, there's other Android like the snapdragons that do this thing where
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:54.940]  there's high power, high performance cores and low power, low lower performance cores,
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.760]  and it switched between them. So when your iPhone didn't really need like iPhone, your
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:06.640]  iPhone seven doesn't need a lot of CPU performance, it'll use to low power cores. And when it
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:12.960]  does need more performance, it switches to two high performance cores on the the a 11
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:19.920]  bionic it and I can't emphasize what a breakthrough this is. It's it's always using the low performance
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.480]  cores. And when it needs more performance, it adds the high performance course. And so
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:32.180]  it the multi core performance difference between these two is it's absolutely jaw dropping
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:36.680]  and nothing like what you would expect in a 12 month year over year upgrade. And the
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.720]  iPhone eights get them to
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:45.600]  Yeah, they all get them and that and the performance controller too. It's more sophisticated even
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.240]  than just switching or adding because they can traffic control between all of them as
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.800]  far as I understand it from the presentation is that you can get you can get any combination
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:02.520]  there of whereas the previous fusion chip, it was they switched them off and on in pairs.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.400]  Like it's sort of Yeah, it was sort of much less sophisticated. So basically, just a more
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.000]  sophisticated version of what they were doing before, but an enormously forward in terms
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.520]  of efficiency. And like one of the big questions I think are big, like, kickbacks right away.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.560]  Everybody was like, Oh, well, it's getting some performance gains because it has it got
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.120]  to drop 32 bit, right? Like it doesn't have to do 32 bit, it can do only 64 bit now. And
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.520]  I think that's true. But I don't think that that's, I don't think that should account
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.920]  in people's minds for much of the performance game. It really is an enormous jump forward
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920]  in processing power and efficiency.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.440]  Yeah, there may be that's an interesting question as to whether part of this performance controller
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.360]  is the fact that it only has to do 64 bit. My understanding, though, is that the dropping
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:57.760]  of 32 bit and the performance gains from that is really more that it's not really I could
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.640]  be wrong, it might there might be a performance control or CPU level silicon advantage to
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:09.540]  that. But mainly, it's sort of a ram issue where we're supporting both means you have
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:15.560]  to have both versions of all the OS frameworks. And when a 32 bit app launches on iOS 10,
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:22.760]  you have to load all of app kit and whatever other blank kit frameworks, you know, insert,
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:30.920]  you know, camera kit, whatever it in broad strokes, and I'm sure people who truly understand
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.760]  what's going on, they might roll their eyes. But in broad strokes, it's almost like you've
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.800]  got two versions of iOS running, you've got the 32 bit version and the 64 bit version.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.460]  And and the context switching of that is, you know, it's just fairly significant, whereas
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:49.160]  going 64 bit only, it just drops a whole level of that, that you just don't even have to
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.480]  worry about. But you might be right, there might be something and maybe it was just that
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.060]  it was easier to develop the performance controller, if you only knew you had, you know, one set
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.600]  of frameworks, and you never had to worry about this, that sort of context switching.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:09.720]  Yeah, and I think that there's, there are going to be people who will try to dampen,
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.680]  which it's only right to do dampen the amount of like, over the top enthusiasm about this
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.320]  processor by saying, Well, you know, look, here are the caveats, here are the things
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:25.160]  that may, you know, they may be doing to get these performance numbers or whatever, because
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.520]  we've seen some of the Geekbench public Geekbenches already, you know, coming from test devices
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:35.000]  out there that are showing like MacBook Pro like performance.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.880]  My hat's off to the people in the hands on area who managed to get to the App Store and
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.880]  down.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880]  I know.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:47.000]  Because when you're using it, there is somebody from Apple supervising you. I don't know.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.360]  I don't. I'm not quite sure how that happened. Because what they was able to do that. Right.
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.160]  How did they sign into the App Store? I'm not even sure if that's how these numbers
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]  leaked. I don't know.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.720]  I don't know if it was. Yeah, I don't know if it was that. All I saw was a screenshot
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:03.160]  right on the Twitter's. And, you know, it was showing like a MacBook Pro like performance
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.440]  coming out of that thing. And then of course, there are people who are like, Ah, well, you
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.920]  know, you got to take into account the 32-bit switch. You got to take into account this
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:16.440]  and that and the other thing. And I get all that. But I have two things to say about that.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:22.600]  One Apple did it. Right. Like their Silicon team did it. All of those things that you're
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.760]  saying. Oh, they just dropped 32-bit. Oh, OK. But they had to drop 32-bit. They were
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.200]  literally the first first phone ever to use a true 64-bit processor. And they spent three
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.400]  years building that, you know, and now it's paying off. Right. Like they transitioned
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.560]  their file system, the 64-bit file system without a hitch to like a billion devices.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:51.840]  You know, like zero problems, like nobody. I never saw a single person say, oh, I upgraded
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.560]  to iOS 10 or whatever and my file system screwed up. No, not a single one. I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.000]  Right. So they had to put in the work. And then the second aspect of it is what I
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.200]  feel is important to point out, even though it won't affect people in the near term, the
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:16.400]  A11 is putting up these numbers and performing this way on a battery powered device. Like,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  can you imagine how powerful that thing actually is? If it can put up a MacBook Pro like number
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:30.160]  on a battery? Imagine the performance your battery life performance your MacBook Pro
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:37.080]  would get if it had the iPhone 8 battery. Right. Like imagine an iPhone with a MacBook
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:45.480]  sized battery. That's how good your MacBook's battery life would be. So look, everybody's
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.040]  always like just championed it to bits of know when Apple is going to switch over and
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.080]  put ARM CPUs into MacBooks and all this stuff. And, you know, a lot of people see the touch
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:02.400]  ID and the touch bar as testing the waters, because that obviously has an ARM CPU in it
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.720]  or ARM part in it. But, you know, I don't know. I'm not a prognosticator in that regard.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.000]  And there are tons of people that are much more smarter, much more smarter, obviously,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.520]  much smarter than I am. Yeah, as proofed, much smarter than I am about processor lifespan
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.040]  and like when that's the right thing for them to do. And I don't know system architecture
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.960]  on a low level to know are they ready to do that and all that. Right. But just coming
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:30.760]  from a purely strategic standpoint in terms of what they're building there, they could
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.960]  probably switch now. Right. They could probably switch very, very closely to now. And that's
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.320]  that's crazy, crazy impressive over the past three years what they've done. And I'd like
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.480]  to point out that all of these really massive, fun and incredibly technical, obviously, improvements
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:55.000]  have been made on, quote unquote, S years, you know, the years that most people were
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.880]  like, oh, you know, who cares? Right. It's like, well, you should care because they're
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.080]  literally building the future of your processing power on your laptop in front of your face.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:10.960]  You know, I saw somebody at that, somebody I know at Apple who works on iPad and they're
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.480]  at the event. And, you know, a typical Apple person, they're not going to tell me anything.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:26.640]  But all I said, all I said to him was, holy shit, the A11. And he just smiled. So you
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.120]  bring this up. I wrote about this during fireball. I wrote about this, that I retweeted that
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.800]  screenshot floating around with them, because somebody somebody said, I got like, I don't
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.100]  know, a thousand goddamn likes on it. But somebody said, holy shit, this is like MacBook
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:45.280]  performance. And I retweeted it with a comment. MacBook Pro performance, MacBook Pro, not
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:51.400]  MacBook. Like this blows the standard MacBook away, right? Like the nicest regular MacBook
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.920]  that you can get the CPU performance on your iPad eight. Not even if you just get the eight,
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.000]  the six hundred ninety nine dollar iPhone eight beats the MacBook. It's MacBook Pro
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.040]  performance. And of course, out of the woodwork come the Android fans. And they're like, I
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:14.800]  thought benchmarks don't matter. You know, that's no matter. And nobody ever said this
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.600]  is why nobody is saying you should buy an iPhone because it performs as great geek bench
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:26.060]  benchmarks. Nobody is saying that. But this is unprecedented in the history of personal
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:32.800]  computing like it, because in the old days, there were times like it sort of was like
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.360]  a tide coming in and out where every once in a while, Apple would make this breakthrough
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:43.600]  back before they switched to Intel. Like when they first switched to power PC, the Macs
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.320]  were power Macs when they first had to came out. They were arguably and I think it's fair
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:59.320]  to say they jumped ahead of of the PC and then very quickly until past them again. And
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:10.960]  the power PC architecture sort of languished. And then there were times like the the power
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:18.600]  Mac G four was the G four sort of put them back in the game. And then it quickly languished.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.000]  And then it just never went anywhere. And so there were times when as an Apple user,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.960]  as a Mac user, you're sort of you really were effectively making a conscious choice to use
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:33.400]  a platform that in terms of pure computing performance was behind the rest of the industry.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.320]  And you know, I did. So I stuck with the Mac through all those years, because I liked the
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:43.960]  software. I liked the design. And, you know, I, but I was aware I wasn't like in denial
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.800]  that dollar for dollar or just in terms of like, what's the fastest performing computer
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.280]  I can buy? Is it as fast as the fastest performing PC? No, I knew it wasn't. But I was fine with
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.040]  that, because I liked the platform. It's never been the case, though, that the people you
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.500]  know, and in some broad sense, Android is the new windows, because it's the platform
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:07.480]  that, you know, is licensed and everybody uses it. It was never the case that Windows
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:15.000]  users had had to accept that Max had blowaway performance that blew them away. But that
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.200]  is the case now. And they're losing their minds over this. Like it, it, there's a certain
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.840]  contingent of Android user who prefers the platform, which is totally reasonable. I get
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:33.600]  it. I don't like it as much, but I could see why some people might, but who also want like
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:40.240]  the best performing hardware in the world. And they can't have that. And it's like causing
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.880]  cognitive dissonance in their minds.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:18:14.640]  That, that like one-offsmanship is sort of where the specs discussion falls apart for me, right? I mean, and like you mentioned earlier, people are going like, oh, I thought specs don't matter or whatever. But the effects of the specs do, right? The effects of what is being done there matter. And that's what it's capable of. So you honestly, I don't even, I
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:44.480]  really wish people who are in Android that feel some sort of FOMO or whatever about the, even the processing power, let's just say that, right? They're like, oh man, I want a phone that uses Android that has the most powerful processor in the world. And my question to them is why? Like, why do you want that most powerful processor or whatever? Is it just because, you know, holding your hand, you have that? And the answer for some people would be yes. Like they just want it. They want to know, like, honestly, it's the same reason I upgrade my GPU.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:19:11.960]  Like habitually, like, I want to know if I pull up my Destiny 2 on a PC in October, it's going to run like 4K with all of the water droplets and, you know, body fluids and everything looking crisp. And that's fine. That's just, I do it consciously knowing that I'm, you know, probably spending money before I need to, to upgrade my GPU. And some people do the same thing with an Android phone. They're like, oh, and I got the new hotness because it's the fastest in the world or whatever.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:40.080]  And so now they are faced, as you said, with this dissonance problem where they're like, oh, I cannot get something that goes blow for blow in Android, you know, goes blow for blow with an A11. But my question to them is, like, why do you want that processor? And I think that that's the strength of iOS, because it gives people that unified platform to build for and the ceiling of maximum power that they know they can target.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:20:06.680]  Like, they know the rules of their world. And so when they go in there, they know they can cast a fireball or they know they can, you know, summon a dragon or whatever. They know exactly what they can do within the frameworks of that world that Apple has built for them. Whereas on Android, as a developer who wants to push the limits, your targets get narrower and narrower and narrower, the more you want to push the platform.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:19.040]  And so that's why I always ask people, like, why? Why do you want a more powerful processor on Android? Because guess what? All you're going to get is a handful of demo apps that can even take advantage of it. And those apps will probably not scale.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:44.560]  Obviously, there are a few apps from major developers, like games, that may push it, right, and are built to push it. But by and large, if you're going into an A11 powered iPhone, like an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 10, you know that the apps getting built for that thing by the people that know how to do it are going to be pushing the boundaries of what that's capable of.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:21:00.560]  Like, you're going to, within months, you're going to be seeing what really truly what that thing is capable of. And that doesn't happen on Android, because it's not a symbiotic relationship between the developer ecosystem and the actual hardware that you're using.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:28.560]  It really is as though like, in the mobile era, it's as though imagine if like Microsoft and Intel had been one company and kept the chips to themselves. And, you know, it it's undeniable that Apple's chip team is better than Qualcomm's and better than Samsung. Samsung has their own chips. I forget what they call them. Like in a weird the weird way that there's a lot of chips.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:48.560]  Like in a weird the weird way that there's literally like two different Galaxy S8s, one with a Snapdragon and one with the custom Samsung chip. But the performance on the Samsung chip isn't really all that different than the Snapdragon. Like Apple is literally like two years, maybe even more ahead of of the industry.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.560]  And there's just no precedent for that in the PC side of things.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:22:07.560]  And again, you you get this if you get the base model iPhone eight, you know, like it's it's and again, this is not the main reason why you had a very good line in the car when we were driving where it's not the specs that matter, it's the effects that matter.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:25.560]  Meaning what what what how does the user benefit from this? And but they are real effects, you know, like and one of them is battery life where this faster performance means if you want to do this thing on your phone and and the processor can do it without even breaking a sweat.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.560]  It takes less of the battery life away and you get longer battery life.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:37.560]  That's right. That's right. Yeah. It's like it's like, you know, you got, you know, Joe DiMaggio out there playing in your your neighborhood ballpark.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:47.560]  Right. Like, is it going to be an effort for him to crush it out of the park? No, you know, it's he's going to be fine. And so that it does allow overhead is important.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:23:01.560]  Right. So just to give you an example, ARKit, one of the reasons that many developers are excited about it after they learn this fact, they're excited about it is that it uses almost none of the GPU.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:13.560]  Right. I mean, almost none. I think it activates it and uses some bare minimum amount of it. But nearly all of the GPU is completely untouched by just firing up the ARKit framework.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:26.560]  So all of the work that ARKit does for the developer in getting a point cloud and and plane detection and tracking and updating that tracking and et cetera, et cetera, it's all CPU based.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:37.560]  And the GPU is left completely alone because Apple knows that many of these developers will be building in unity or an unreal and they're going to need all of that GPU to perform those calculations.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:51.560]  So to do those to render those those scenes. So ARKit, all that stuff is on the processor to do. And in order to do that efficiently and consistently, they need precise understanding of the capabilities of the processor.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:24:00.560]  Incredibly good handling over the power utilization of that processor. And then, of course, handling over the rest of the hardware, like the sensors and things.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:08.560]  And that that kind of like, you know, blended efficiency only comes when you build the silicon and then you build the framework.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:19.560]  I think that another good example of that. And again, Apple does like to put features in the new hardware that's exclusive to them.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:29.560]  I'm lacking a better word here. This sounds mean spirited, but out of marketing spite, let's say that, hey, you can only do this if you buy the new iPhone.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:38.560]  But I think that the new portrait mode lighting effects, it's not just spite of, hey, sorry, iPhone seven plus users, you can't you don't get this.
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.560]  It's only for iPhone eight and iPhone 10. I don't think so.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.560]  I think it actually has to do with the increased performance overhead because it's all rendered in real time when you do it.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:55.560]  Meaning portrait mode on the iPhone eight plus and on the iPhone 10 has this these lighting effects that you can do.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:18.560]  And as Phil Schiller explained on stage, they're not filters. They truly are computationally simulating advanced lighting effects of like, you know, like it detects eyes and and simulates placing a light that would the way that a professional portrait photographer would place a light just to highlight your eyes.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:26.560]  And it's not just after you snap the photo and then it goes and a little spinner shows up and it like does it. It's it's all rendered in real time.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:40.560]  I think that's another example of it where the hardware has the performance of these chips truly has an effect on the experience of using the device in a way that people can appreciate.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:51.560]  Even if it's not. Yeah, even if it's not. I think some people would go like, hey, Apple doesn't chip stuff on purpose. And, you know, I know I know people will pull examples out and, you know, wave them around if you ask.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:26:02.560]  But in terms of something like the portrait mode, I think that even if they could be supported, my gut tells me they could probably get it to run on like an iPhone seven plus. Right.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:10.560]  But even if they could support it there, the experience might not be, you know, as flawless as they showed it on stage, where it's just like bing, bang, boom.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:20.560]  And maybe the live preview wouldn't work, but afterwards it would work. Or maybe the processing time is just longer so that when you snap it, you get the spinny.
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.560]  Right. Where, you know, as you saw on stage, it's like bang, you know, you shoot the picture and that's it.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.560]  Right. There's no waiting around. Doesn't go to a splash screen. It doesn't say, OK, give me 10 minutes. Check back, you know.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:39.560]  And it's just I think experience is sometimes why those decisions are made, even though they can support it or can ship it.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.560]  And some people will cry foul like, hey, I don't mind. Just give it to me.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  I think that sometimes it's a matter of that, sometimes a matter of resources and supporting it or whatever.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:55.560]  But I guarantee that like the best experience you're going to have is with the A11 because this stuff is cutting edge and they built the silicon to support it.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:01.560]  You know, they really they really said like, oh, hey, we could do this. OK, well, what do we need to get this done?
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.560]  And they wouldn't ask their silicon teams to build it. You know, that's that's how it works.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.560]  Then what else is new? So all of the new iPhones, including the iPhone eight, get a true tone display.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:22.560]  And anybody who has an iPad pro with a true tone display, which heretofore was the only Apple product with true tone.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:32.560]  I love true tone. I cannot wait for it to it's not quite as profound as going from non retina to retina, but it is close.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:41.560]  And it just like with retina, once you have one device that's retina, when you look at non retina devices, you're like, oh, my God, look at these big fat pixels.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:50.560]  And it's like when you're have a true tone device and then you look at a non true tone device indoors with like incandescent lighting, you're like, why is everything so blue?
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:28:00.560]  You know, it is not an iPhone 10 only feature. It is iPhone eight and a serious, serious upgrade year over year.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.560]  Trying to think what else true tones. Great. I love that. I love that thing.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:12.560]  I mean, as somebody who is also hypersensitive to color temperatures, you know, it's it's been a huge, huge plus for me for with the iPad.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:19.560]  So I'm really happy to to see that come to iPhone. It's it's it's in other words.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  And I think there were so many people that I spoke to, you know, just other writers, you know, Jim Dalrymple and other people.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:42.560]  Like if there were no iPhone 10 this year, the iPhone eight as are as they are exactly feature for feature and dollar for dollar, what they cost, what they do would be a very solid year over year update.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.560]  Yeah, I think you'd have to endure Apple would have to endure that same wave of like, oh, is the iPhone boring, you know, stuff.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.560]  But it would be fine. You know, like the people would buy them. People that needed an upgrade would get the upgrade.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:04.560]  You get nice, solid camera upgrades. You get a great new portrait lighting feature, which, you know, I think is a really, really cool application of computer vision.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:12.560]  You get a lot of a lot of nice things at very if you don't use a case, a very different look with the glass backs.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:22.560]  Yeah, yeah, the glass backs that we saw. I mean, I really like the gold. I think it's really cool. It has like a sort of pink cast to it in the back underneath the glass.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:29.560]  I guess it's like coated on the back as a sort of like millennial pink type pink, very pink.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:42.560]  Part of the reason I wanted you to be on the show is that if you weren't the guest for this wrap up show, I was going to have to rip you off in so many ways because so many things that you said privately to me that I want to repeat.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:51.560]  But like, I like that they went from having two golds to having one gold and like you described it as a it's not rose gold, but it is a rosy gold.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:30:00.560]  Right. And I think that is I can't explain it like if you've only seen it in photos and you haven't seen it in person yet, it's that's the best way to describe it.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:15.560]  And I think it is a very again, I probably shouldn't speak to fashion, but it's to me seems like from what I've seen, you know, in storefronts and stuff like that, it's the kind of gold that changes depending on what light you look at.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:21.560]  And like in the sunlight, it'll be very pink or whatever. And then like under fluorescence, it may look more straight gold.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.560]  But I don't think it's I don't think it's the death of rose gold like everybody thinks it is.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:44.560]  No, no. But it's like a shift in what is the hot flavor of rose gold, you know, and the color of the glass is a very it just seems of the moment, you know, like I don't know that it's a timeless color, I think, but it's a very 2017 2018 color.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:50.560]  And I think I think it I think that's partly why so many of the fine like it should be a color of the time, you know.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:31:01.560]  I think rose gold as as it was is over, you know, and it's it's and it's interesting to me that they've kind of narrowed in on one flavor of gold.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.560]  It looks great. Yeah.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:17.560]  Looks good. And the silver looks good, you know, that just all you gotta do is run look over people's shoulders at the at the thing you see that the glass, the glass back is definitely more active.
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.560]  It feels like the backs of the aluminum did feel a little bit static.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.560]  Yeah, I think that's the best way to put it.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.560]  Put it. It's like it feels solid. It feels static.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.560]  And some people like that. I get it.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:39.560]  But like the reason I went with jet black with my iPhone seven is because it felt more alive, like, you know, it's like sparkly and shiny. And, you know, you get a lot of a lot of cool reflections and just feels more, I don't know, more active to me.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:46.560]  And I think that the glass backs on the eights just make them feel there's translucency there.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:52.560]  There's more going on, you know, and that maybe it'll encourage more people to use clear cases or no cases.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.560]  All of that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if you know, you mentioned you mentioned the thing. Oh, so good.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560]  Well, no, you keep going.
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:05.560]  You mentioned the thing. I just wanted to loop back because you mentioned the thing about if that they had not released an iPhone X.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:16.560]  And this might be an interesting time to talk about this, but I've been thinking about this and I was going to I was going to write about it at some point, but I'll just say it here and maybe I'll write about it.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:28.560]  I don't know. But I really think that there's a lot of people with a lot of angst over the notch. Right. And over the screen not being full screen and they see it as a betrayal, you know, of Apple's attention to detail.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:39.560]  And that, you know, I mean, quite literally, Steve Jobs would never have shipped this device or never agreed to let it be shipped because it's like, oh, find a way to get rid of the ears or whatever.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:45.560]  Or heck, you know, they're just software wise, just put black up there, you know, or whatever it is.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:54.560]  And I get it. Like, I get it. I think honestly, the value, the arguments are valid. I'm not out there carrying water for Apple and saying, oh, you should love the horns and all of this. Right.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:07.560]  It is what it is, you know, but I think that it is, while not creating excuses or any of that, I'm just a person who likes to ask why. Right. Like, why? Why would they release it like this?
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:14.560]  Why would they release it before they could figure out a way to eliminate those things, if that's what you think that they were trying to do and couldn't do? Right.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:27.560]  Eliminate those little ears or the notch or whatever you want to call it. And the way I think about it, I believe, and I have not verified this with anybody at Apple, this is not based on inside information, any of that junk.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:39.560]  This is just me thinking. It seems to me that the iPhone X, I'm going to crib a word from you talking about the AirPad charger, but the iPhone X is like a superset of the iPhone 8.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:54.560]  In other words, it's like we got the iPhone 8 as a base. Now, what can we do to make sure that we are catching what we believe in our hearts to be the next wave of platform change?
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:11.560]  And right now, that's all about computer vision and augmented reality, like computational computer vision based interfaces and input mechanisms are all anybody thinks about in tech right now.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:18.560]  Even if that's not their space, they're like, hey, how will our business be affected by this shift if it happens? Because everybody's sort of like thinking it's going to happen.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:29.560]  And if you're shifting to AR as an interface and the camera as an input mechanism and all of these things, if you look at Apple and Apple's thinking about these things and they plan three years in advance.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:38.560]  So three years ago, they were thinking about these things when they started building out the system and get all the silicon ready for it and all that stuff and buying the companies.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:54.560]  In 2013, they started buying these companies and all of that, they're planning for all of this. If you look at it now versus 12 months from now, if the platform shift happens the way people think it happens over the next year, 12 months later would be too late.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:35:08.560]  They needed to get out there now with a camera that shows off not only their ability, but also inspires people to think about it and developers to start developing for it where they have this true depth camera.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.560]  They have all of these tools that allow people more precise accelerometers.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:36.560]  The A11 is optimized for AR and for AR applications and for computational photography and obviously Core ML and all of these stuff all adds up to a perfect storm of we need to ship this now and plant our flag in this new platform generation now to pull ahead of our competitors or to push forward in this way.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:52.560]  Whereas Google with Tango, they got to refactor significantly now and they launched obviously ARCore and all of that, which is fine I hear. It's not crazy bad or anything. They took a lot of Tango and just cut out some stuff.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:36:03.560]  But they don't have a Tango device that's mass market. They don't have however many they're going to sell these things, 100 million device Tango phone. They tried that and it didn't work.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:19.560]  And so now Apple I think sees a lot of opportunities for them. They can get a device that has the depth camera out in the market at massive scale. They can plant the flag in computational photography. They can plant a flag in AR and depth sensing as an input mechanism and output mechanism.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:33.560]  They've got a lot of positives here so they go why not now? Why can't we take all of the technology that we have and put it in this thing and hell if we're going to need this tab to put these cameras in, fuck it. Pardon my French.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:43.560]  But it's just like we're going to do this because we feel it's the right time. It's still a great experience. We don't feel it compromises it. Now you can argue that and then that's what we're going to do.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:51.560]  So that's the way I've been thinking about this. It's a superset of the iPhone 8 that they were able to launch now to plant a flag for this next generational shift in platforms.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:37:20.560]  That was great. That was absolutely one of the great rants I've heard on a podcast in a long time and I agree with every word of it. And now here's why it's wrong. No, no, I agree with it. And so if I were at Apple and in a position to vote thumbs up or thumbs down on the hardware aspects of the notch, I would, for everything that you just said, I'm going to give it a reluctant thumbs up.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:32.560]  Do I wish that they could have all the features and all of the dot projector and the camera and everything and somehow fit it behind the pixels of the display? Sure.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:43.560]  Do I think that the I think the ideal form of the iPhone 10 design would be a note, you know, the same thing with no notch. That's the ideal form.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:38:03.560]  Right. Right. And they can't do it. And therefore, since we can't do it, what do we do? I think the notch is reasonable because I think if you didn't have the notch, if you just had a forehead that was of that thing, then you would have to have a corresponding chin because I think the symmetry matters.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:14.560]  And I feel like the symmetry is maintained in portrait mode while you're holding the phone vertically. Even with the notch, there is a certain symmetry to it.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:21.560]  My problem with the notch and I think I wrote this, but effectively, it's not the notch itself in hardware. It's the way the notch is handled in software.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:28.560]  And I'm even willing to go with the embrace the notch UI style again while you're holding the phone vertically.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:37.560]  It's the fact that when you hold it horizontally that they're going with this, you can see it and you scroll. It's over there on the left all the time.
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.560]  I think it's ridiculous. I think that when you hold the phone sideways, they should cover the notch with black.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:49.560]  And the thing that I find so surprising about it is that it's when they went to OLED and OLED has blacks that can hide it.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:39:00.560]  And the best example of it is Apple Watch. Except in extreme sunlight, you can't see where the display ends and the bezel starts on Apple Watch.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:07.560]  The black of the background of Apple Watch, except in the most extreme of sunlight, you just can't see it.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:12.560]  And even in the extreme sunlight, it's sort of subtle. You have to kind of look for it. So they could do it.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.560]  And I think it's almost ridiculous that they don't.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:28.560]  Right. And I am not of the camp that I'm trying to say Apple loves the notch and are just big fans of the notch.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  And why can't you see why they're right? I think that they would, as you said, eliminate the notch that they could. I firmly believe that.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:47.560]  I think that it's my perspective on it is they felt that the notch was worth it given that what the tradeoffs were, what they could accomplish.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  And some people disagree and some people were like, well, they shouldn't ship it because Apple's a company that thrives on detail and look at all of these caveats to this notch, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:11.560]  But I honestly think that Apple's guidelines, like design guidelines, if you look at those about making the notch work in your designs or whatever, none of those guidelines are like the notch is the way of the future.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.560]  They're like, here's how to make your apps work with the notch.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:23.560]  It's less like plan for the notch to take over Apple's line of hand computers.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:32.560]  This is how you deal with the notch, plain and simple. And that, I think, speaks to me to be like, maybe our next one won't have the notch.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.560]  And maybe it will for another generation. But eventually that notch is going bye bye.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:46.560]  In terms of the keynote, I do kind of admire the keynotes embrace the notch aspect and compare and contrast.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:55.560]  And I wrote this, but I think it's a very good comparison to the camera bump on the iPhone. And I do think that the notch is is very analogous to the camera bump.
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:09.560]  It's the front facing equivalent. It ideally you would want a phone like the iPhones, the iPhone SE and all the phones from the iPhone S and earlier where the camera is flush with the back and you don't feel it.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:13.560]  It sits flat on a table and there is no bump.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:26.560]  But I understand why the bump is there because a thinner phone everywhere except for the bump feels better in hand and thinner is, for lack of a better word, sexier on hardware.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:37.560]  And yet the physics of photography mean that the lenses need to be a certain distance from the sensor and bigger sensors require bigger lenses that are further away.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:53.560]  It's in conflict. So I get it. But the early pictures of there were promotional photos of the iPhone 6 that were a mini little controversy in our world where they had pictures of the phone from the side where you couldn't see the bump.
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  And the question is, did Apple fake that? And if you sit here and hold it, you can hold it at a certain angle where sideways you can hide the bump.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:07.560]  And I think that they were genuine photos. They didn't Photoshop the way I stand when I go on stage, like just a certain way.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:13.560]  Right. So it's a certain way. So I look better, you know, and that's what they did.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:21.560]  But there's a certain argument to be made that that's actually even if it's a genuine photo that wasn't Photoshopped, it still is sort of disingenuous not to show the bump.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:32.560]  And so they've gone the opposite way with the notch and literally to the point where one of the things that had people almost like a pop leptic, you know, was that they were in a Johnny.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:38.560]  I've narrated video design video when they showed video playing like somebody watching Wonder Woman.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  The notch was literally over overhanging the content of the video. The video is filling every pixel of the display, including round corners. So it's cutting off the corners of the video.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:43:02.560]  And the notch was actually overlaid over the content of the video. And people were like WTF, including me.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:10.560]  And the truth is, it's just like now where you can switch between you double tap on a video in it, you know, even on an iPhone seven.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:21.560]  And it'll either fill the screen and cut off some of the video or it'll preserve the perfect aspect ratio of the video and use black bars at the top or bottom as necessary to to do that.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:30.560]  And it's the same way on the iPhone 10. And by default, it actually defaults to doing what I would strongly argue is the right thing, which is preserving the aspect ratio of the video.
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  So it's actually Apple actually went to the non default in the in the video just to not hide the notch, which I kind of admire.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:49.560]  Right. Right. You've got to give them sort of credit for that. Right. Like there's in some way there's a certain integrity to it, I would say.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. You know, so the camera bump thing, I think that there is a definite, as you said, there's a straight up allegory between those two.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.560]  However, that camera bump is only going to get bigger over the next couple of years.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:19.560]  It makes me wonder how the notch will do, you know, how soon it will go or how soon it will find they'll find a way to circumvent and whatever that is, by the way, they're already working on it and have been for a year or two. Right.
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:25.560]  Like whatever we're trying to like divine, they've already done it, you know, or already figured out how they're going to do it.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:31.560]  And like the camera bump, you look at next year, that camera or I'm saying next year. Right. I'm just pulling this out of my butt.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:46.560]  I don't know when they're going to actually do it, but next year, whenever they decide to put a depth camera on the other side of the phone, that bumps got to get bigger or they got to rearrange the elements inside it to make room for the IR emitter and projector and all that jazz.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:52.560]  Now, it's less effective on that side of the phone, to be honest. It's pretty it's much more effective when it's close.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:45:00.560]  So they may be working on other systems for the other side of the phone. They may not be an exact mirror, you know, because IR is obviously much more efficient at close range.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.560]  So, you know, but whatever it is, it's going to have to go in that bump.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:12.560]  You know, I do think I, you know, again, I have no inside juice on this whatsoever. I could be totally wrong.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:26.560]  But I again, I think you're right there probably either won't be IR or if it is IR, it won't be quite as effective because IR is, you know, it's mostly there for your face and for portrait photos and for the face ID.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  But there might be something else that they can do to do a depth map on the back.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:46.560]  And I do feel like that's part of how phone photography, meaning no matter how big that camera bump is going to get, in theory, it has to be easy enough to still slip in your jeans.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  You know, so it's never going to be the size that and it's I don't think it's ever going to telescope out like some point and shoot cameras do.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.560]  Right. It's never the camera lens is never going to be that big.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:16.560]  So within the confines of the physics of a phone size camera system, I feel like the way that that phone photography is going to continue to catch up and or pull ahead of a true photo.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  You know, true camera cameras would be things like depth mapping combined with the computer. It's computational photography.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:34.560]  But it needs I think there's room for additional sensors back there and not not physically, but room in in in the system philosophically, philosophically.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.560]  Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:46.560]  Because I think that there's definitely not a scenario where you just take the exact same array and flip it around. And it's really all that useful.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.560]  But whatever it is, they're definitely working on something there. And so that bumps not going not going bye bye.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  One thing that only really occurred to me like yesterday thinking about this is that this is the first time to my memory, unless I'm missing a feature.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:11.560]  This is the first time that there is something to the front facing camera that is way better than the back camera like the you know, whatever you want to call it.
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:21.560]  I mean, I mean, I'll just say it. I'll just say the word selfie selfie camera has always been you break out in hives.
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:25.560]  Well, if Schiller can say it, I can say it.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:33.560]  I guess they you know, they call it what do they call it? The FaceTime camera? I think they still call it but you know, they should call it the selfie camera.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:40.560]  But the front facing camera has always been a subset and really a sort of severe subset of the back facing camera.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:46.560]  It's always had smaller sensor and it's you know, it's just not as good a camera.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:53.560]  The depth stuff, the stuff that's in the notch, it in some ways makes it better.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:03.560]  It actually is, you know, it's a really interesting piece of technology and the back camera doesn't have it.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:05.560]  Kind of interesting.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:09.560]  Yeah, that's true. I didn't think about that either. That makes total sense.
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:16.560]  I think that it's never leapfrogged. It has come on parody at some point, I think.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:25.560]  Remember too that like, you know, with the caveats that the lens elements are always different, you know, front versus back because you need different field of view and all that.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:33.560]  I think at some point it reached sensor resolution parody or sensor parody, but then like they always kind of go back and forth.
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:40.560]  But yeah, I think so. I think you're right. Definitely speaks to the times and how people use their phones.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:46.560]  You know, I mean that the rise of the selfie is not just about taking pictures of yourself. It's about how people communicate.
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:58.560]  The Snapchat generation and, you know, people that are comfortable communicating either via video or for image in place of text.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:02.560]  It does definitely make sense to focus on that camera more and devote technology to it.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:08.560]  And of course, face ID, you know, all of that. It's an amalgam, right? It's not like, oh, this is the reason.
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:14.560]  But yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely a good point.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  Should we jump to talking about face ID? Is there anything else on? I mean, yeah, we can.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.560]  I mean, you had Craig on your show. I already have that, which was nice.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.560]  You had an interview with him for TechCrunch, which was also nice.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:36.560]  And you covered like the privacy related aspects of it that I kind of slipped my mind. So that's kind of interesting.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.560]  So I don't I guess we don't have to spend a ton of time on face ID because you've written about your interview.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:46.560]  Previous episode of the show is me talking to Craig Federighi about it. And I don't think there's much left on the table.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.560]  But, you know, I don't think we're more qualified to talk about it.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:50:03.560]  Right. You know, what really what blew me at what blows me away about Craig is that he clearly understands every single aspect of everything Apple is doing at a technology level.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:21.560]  In the sense of that great Richard Feynman axiom that the only way to prove if you truly understand something is if you can deliver a freshman essay or not essay.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.560]  But what do you call it? Lecture about it. You know, can you explain it? Explain it to a five year old.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:40.560]  If you can't explain it in plain terms, then you don't truly understand something. And Craig excels at explaining how all of this stuff works, like differential privacy and and all the complex ways that they're managing it.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:46.560]  So he understands everything they do and has time to manage, manage all these teams.
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:56.560]  Like it's like I kind of get it that it's useful for Apple to have a senior executive who truly understands all of the technology the company is working on.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:09.560]  I get it. But I can't believe that that individual is also somebody who manages all of the software teams at the same time, which you would think would be take up, you know, 60, 70 hours a week.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:20.560]  Yeah. And it reminds me of this anecdote. I'd heard the anecdote before, but I heard it first person as well.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:36.560]  And from a buddy that, you know, I think works at ILM, Todd Vasiri, who's, you know, I think he's spoken about this on Twitter, too, a little bit, but he gets to work with James Cameron at one point on one of the shows.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:46.560]  And you get you just get this vibe from from Cameron that he could do your job or that at least he knows the fundamentals of your job.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.560]  And you are in doubt as to whether or not he could do it better than you. Like, I mean, he may not. Right.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:59.560]  He may need to sit down and learn all your tools or whatever, but he understands the fundamentals of what you're doing and how to get the performance out of you that he wants.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:17.560]  And you have this understanding that if he had the time and if it was in his schedule to do so, that he might be able to sit down and do this thing that you're doing and that you want to impress him and that you can impress him because he knows how hard it is to do what you do.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:32.560]  You know, or how how tough of a task he's giving you. Right. Because there's a difference between a manager like that and a manager that's like has no concept of how hard it is to build a system that you're building or to squash a bug that you're quashing.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:39.560]  And one who has been in the trenches and who knows it or at least, you know, has an understanding of how hard it is.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:46.560]  And you want to work harder for those people. You want to do better for those people because you know that they will appreciate it.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:53:03.560]  And, you know, I've always thought I've always kept that in my mind and I'm no I'm no gym camera, but I always try to make sure that I'm at least understanding the scope of the things that I'm asking people to do when I'm managing them, you know, and at least and I personally always love it if I have actually tried to do it, you know, at least once.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:29.560]  And that and whether that's like pull off a particular tone in a piece or whatever and in an editorial, that's that. But in Craig's world, you get the feeling like if he's in there asking you to accomplish, you know, pulling something off like face ID, where it's like, oh, it takes three quarters of a second and he's like, no, it should take a third of a second or whatever that you he knows what's needed to get there.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:38.560]  And you want to impress him by getting you there. And so it's a different kind of vibe than a manager who who you think is really just there to to manage you as a as a cog.
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:54:07.560]  Yeah, there's and Cameron is spoken. I've seen him speak about Stanley Kubrick. He's a huge Kubrick fan. And I think that same thing was true with Kubrick, where he he he mastered all aspects of movie making. He could edit, he could shoot famously, you know, had the camera in his hand for tons of shots. And I remember reading a story. I'm going to box this a little bit because I'm doing it from memory. But one of Kubrick's early studio movies was a great, great heist movie called The Killing.
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:21.560]  I love all those movies. But if you like heist movies, you know, and but you're where you're like, I don't like old movies, but this is so good. And it's so sort of presage is the Tarantino style influenced The Dark Knight to like so much, you know, all of that.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  There's this great anecdote. You know, there's an early scene. I forget when they put it because it is chopped up chronologically. But there's a movie there's a scene where the they're they're planning the heist and it's in the one guy's apartment and it takes place in two rooms. And there's a dolly shot where they're in one room and in one take the camera pans or dolly sideways to go from one room to another. And it was one of the first shots they shot at least it was one of the first scenes that they shot and the thing.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:55:16.560]  And the cinematographer had this all set up and Kubrick came in and looked at it and it was like totally like lazy, you know, like the way that it was lit. And he's like, no, no. And the guy was like, well, you know, it's going to take forever to do it the other way. And Kubrick was just like, fuck you. And he like went and did it and just set up all the lights the right way and said move and just did the dolly shot himself. And then like the cameraman was like, oh, shit, this guy, this guy could do my job. You know, and so it's like, I better I better up my game or I'm going to get fired.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  Totally, you know, change the way he came in to every single scene. He's like, I better do the best that I can do. And I think you're exactly right. What else is there to say about iPhone 10? I mean, it's what are the differences between iPhone 10 and iPhone 8? The screen is obviously different depth camera depth screen is different. The screen is is OLED, you know, obviously, that's a huge jump. One thing and I don't know the answer to this, but one.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:56:13.560]  One thing a lot of people are talking about right now is whether that OLED is pen tile construction or RGB. And they're leaning towards pen tile because of the dithering at the corners that gives it that nice, smooth curve. It's a sub pixel anti aliasing, I guess, that's being used for that that curve. And the question then is if it's pen tile, because of the way the pen tile screens are constructed, the apparent resolution may be actually less than the actual resolution.
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:35.560]  In other words, they're wondering if it's sharp or not, you know, as sharp as the iPhone 8. I don't know, because I've only seen it briefly, obviously, there at the event. Whether you know how those screens compare, but that's an interesting thing that I want to look into. Well, who knows? Who knows what that'll be? But that might be a minor controversy.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  Yeah, I suspect, though, that even if it is pen tile, and I have no idea, but even if it is, there are so many virtual pixels prints or, you know, what they claim to be the pixels print that even if it is pen tile, it still should be smoother, I think, than an iPhone 8. Whether it would be smoother than an eight plus, I don't know. But the eight plus has the weird thing where it's a still a scaled down interface.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:12.560]  It still is not really a true 3x. It's like you treat it as 3x, but they scale it to a certain degree, which decreases the actual sharpness of it to some degree. I don't know.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:38.560]  And the iPhone X is 3x, too, so it's going to be different. So even if it's pen tile, though, I feel, though, that it should be at least as sharp as the eight plus. I don't know. I had about 10 minutes with it in my hand in the hands-on area, and to my not great eyes, but good enough, you know, it looked very good. And I thought the color was excellent, which is my big concern with all OLED screens.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:56.560]  I thought the color was totally, you know, and I saw it side by side with an iPhone 8, and the color was just spot on, you know. So I don't know. I have no hesitation. I can't wait to spend more time with it, but I think it's a very nice display.
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:12.560]  So the display's better. Yeah, you got that. Oh, both cameras are OIS now on the back. Yeah, only on the X, though. Which is nice. You know, only on the X, right? But you were asking about differences. Right. And so that's one difference, the iPhone 8.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:30.560]  And the telephoto photo is not stabilized. Yeah, and on the X, the telephoto lens is f2.4 as opposed to f2.8, which if you're not a photography nerd, just means that it's one entire stop better in low light.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:49.560]  It's about like 36%, I guess, is the number that they cited. So the gains are not, you know, it's not not unnoticeable. 36% is a bunch. So when you're shooting in low light with that telephoto lens, like, let's say at a concert, you know, trying to zoom into the stage.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:59:09.560]  Right. It might, it might default to that telephoto or use more of that telephoto data, because it'll be a little bit sharper. Yeah, it won't be jittery as much. And especially with the OIS too. Right. Yeah, so it's a it's with even OIS aside, it's a full stop faster, and you have OIS and OIS should add at least another stop.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:30.560]  So you get you should get at least two stops, which is pretty significant. Maybe more depending on you know, how good the OIS is, but that's that the cameras definitely better. I think that from the time I spent with it, it's it's even more of an embrace the camera bump industrial design. Like the bump is truly
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:57.560]  Yes, it's got a straight like it comes straight out from the body instead of having any hint of a bezel. Yeah, because like the or a, I guess I would say call it a slope, right? Because it's not. It's a slope with an additional camper on top of it. But the or chamfer I never know which one it is. But this on the eight, it's straight up out of the body out of the glass back. It's like bang, you know, like, here it is. Yeah.
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:15.560]  I'm trying to think what else I even just in 10 minutes, you could and it was nice because in a hands on area, you could pick both upside by side, it there's a it's heavier, it's heavier than like an iPhone eight. I don't know if it's as heavy as the plus, but the plus feels so much bigger in hand because it's so much wider.
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:35.560]  But just the I think it's just the nature of using stainless steel for the sides instead of aluminum. There's it's not like it's too heavy. Like, wow, this, you know, it's not like I'm telling people this is a reason not to buy the 10. But to me, it's heavy in the premium sense, sort of like the way that the stainless steel watch is heavier than the aluminum Apple Watch.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:45.560]  It's not like you feel like you have a weight on your arm, but you just feel like you have a premium watch on your wrist instead of a, you know, regular watch.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:01:09.560]  Yep, yep, exactly. Just a little bit heftier. And the because it's not as large as the plus, the plus may feel, as you mentioned, more heavy. Because if you're holding it, especially if you're holding it like from the bottom, because I think most people when you pick up the iPhone eight plus, you're gonna hold it from the bottom, and they'll the leverage or or balance of the phone, it's gonna be top heavy.
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:37.560]  And so you're, you have more exertion, they're holding it up right, then you do with the X. Yeah, I bottom line, I think is if you're on the fence, if there's anything, you know, if you're thinking, I think I want the iPhone 10. But I don't know, you want the iPhone 10. But on the other hand, the iPhone eight is, if you know, it's really good. I don't know, it's so it I have no idea how this is gonna play out. One thing we know as we record.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:02:05.560]  They've been on sale for two or three days, they're still available. If you get, you know, iPhone eight is on sale, iPhone 10 is not going on sale to like late October. But if you go to buy an iPhone eight, or a plus today, you can still get it on on launch day. So you know, and that is unlike years past where quickly, you know, sometimes within minutes, it switches from same day, you know, launch day delivery to two to three weeks or four weeks or something like that. So that's not the case. But I don't think that's surprising, because I feel like, you know, I don't think that's surprising.
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:25.560]  Because I feel like, I feel like the overwhelming number of the, you know, hundreds of millions of iPhones that get sold every year go to normal people who just feel like they're buying a nice iPhone. And that the number of people who really, really care about having the newest iPhone on the first possible day.
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:49.560]  It's easy to, because we all talk to each other on Twitter and on podcasts, and we read their sites. And it's easy for people to overestimate just how many I like, I don't think that Apple is going to have a hard time selling the iPhone eight and eight plus. But I'm not surprised that they I'm also not surprised that they didn't sell out already.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:55.560]  Because I feel like the people who are going to sell out a launch weekend thing are all going to wait for the 10.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:09.560]  Right. Yeah, the people that have to have the newest thing, the iPhone 10 is technically three minutes newer. So they're going to want that.
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:23.560]  The twins joke. Yeah, I think that's right. I think that there's going to be a contingent of people that are buying this early, that are really just going to gravitate towards the X because of who they are, what kind of buyer they are, what kind of user they are.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:45.560]  I think that there are some people going like, so I was asking, I asked a couple people, I was there, Horace Didier was there, analyst extraordinaire, and Ben Maharan, also an analyst. And I asked them both, you know, what they thought about the gap between the pre-orders between the iPhone eight and eight plus and the 10.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:59.560]  And whether it hurt Apple or how it would affect their, you know, guidance or quarters, whatever. And Ben said that, you know, the guidance that they gave last time was so wide, so broad, that it basically indicates to him that they don't know.
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:08.560]  Yeah, they don't know exactly what the mix will be and that the guidance was so wide as to give them latitude so that it wasn't like, oh, they missed their guidance or whatever.
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  It was just like very wide in terms of range. So it could be, oh, we sold a ton of 10, so the mix is going to trend later and miss this quarter. Or we sold a ton of eights and it's going to hit this quarter, you know, versus next quarter.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:36.560]  But they, I asked Horace the same thing, you know, what he thought was a problem. And he said he didn't really think so. As long as it got here before Christmas, both models, that it really wouldn't affect the quarter that matters, which is Q1.
[02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  And I have a semi-informed as well opinion or feeling, whatever you want to call it, that they don't care.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:05:01.560]  That if you buy a 10 instead of an 8, the answer is, OK, like, what do they care? They don't care. They're fine with it either way. It's not that they're hoping to sell a ton of one or not the other. They're like completely fine.
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:14.560]  I'm sure they have an idea of what they want to sell or whatever. But a lot of people forget that Apple under Tim Cook, one of the superpowers, is that it can have as little as two weeks of inventory at any given time.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:25.560]  That is an enormous tactical advantage when you're releasing serialized devices, because you can go, hey, let's just hold off on producing. Let's produce 20 percent less.
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:41.560]  And that change gets into your inventory channel within two weeks. It's not months where you're eating tons of devices like Samsung, which is like shuffling devices around at one point, trying to get them into carrier channels to bolster their quarter.
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:45.560]  And then the next quarter was like down in the dumps. So that's that advantage they have.
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:06:01.560]  Yeah. And obviously the the shipping delay on the iPhone 10 is not perfect. I'm sure that in a perfect world, it would be the preorders for both would have been the same day and they'd both be coming out at the end of next week.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:12.560]  Right. But I got the sense talking to people at Apple that it is what it is. And this is what happens when you're you're pedal to the metal trying to do the most that you can't.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:21.560]  You know that this you know, this happens, you know, that if we if we never miss a ship date, if we never miss a goal, that means we're not trying hard enough.
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:28.560]  You know, yes, yes, exactly. If you hit it every time, it means that you you let off the pedal right somewhere along the line.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:36.560]  And I think and to hit a target within two weeks or four weeks from three years away, that's pretty, pretty good.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:40.560]  Well, you know, like we have two different projects within a gap.
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:49.560]  Let's see, though, because one thing we don't know, and I'm sure I'm not sure but I given that it's late, it's obviously hard, you know, difficult to produce.
[02:06:49.560 --> 02:07:01.560]  I'm, I'm pretty sure that every time Apple is late on delivering hardware, it also is.
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:10.560]  They can't meet demand immediately. So I'm almost certain I would be shocked if this thing goes on sale on I don't know what day of the week it is.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:19.560]  If it's like midnight Pacific on a Thursday in October when it goes on sale, if by like the time you wake up Friday morning, it's four to six weeks delivery.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:23.560]  You know, let's see how many they actually shipped before the end of the calendar year.
[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:39.560]  But I get the sense to that, that, you know, you know, whatever that means for q1 if if a lot of them don't get into even if you pre order right away, it late October, you may not get it until December or something.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:55.560]  You know, it's very likely to me that it might not be till January or February where where they catch up with demand, but even so they're gonna if they sell the same x number of iPhone 10s in the 12 months.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:08:08.560]  So be it. It's still, you know, they're, you know, they're just not that quarterly driven. Yes, they want to have a great holiday quarter and they want to deliver as many of them as they can and I'm sure they're busting their asses to, to make that possible.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:21.560]  But they're, you know, if they sell, you know, 100 million of the things in 12 months, that's still 100 million of them sold in 12 months. And that's, you know, that's fun.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:38.560]  I guess the last thing, if we do talk about face ID, the thing and I know I brought it up with with Federighi, but we can talk about it a little bit freer. It's a little it was a little uncomfortable to bring it up that I spoke, you know, I have friends who work at Apple, I, you know,
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:46.560]  at least two of them who have been disclosed and have been carrying iPhone 10 around for a while who I spoke to when I was out last week.
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:58.560]  And, you know, they, you know, again, and I have, you know, however much I, I often say that Apple has never lied to me. I've never been told a lie by Apple PR.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  When I've spoken off the record with executives like Phil Schiller or whoever.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:19.560]  I've never been lied to. That's, you know, it's part of the company. It's why, you know, they have integrity like that. And they have their view on the long run, right, where they're not going to tell a lie, which would then make me mistrust everything they tell me, you know, henceforth.
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:29.560]  Have I ever been told things that I suspect are spin? Of course, right. They always try to put the best spin on things. But when I talk to friends who work in the lower levels in engineering, they don't spin.
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:37.560]  They're, they're just, you know, they may, they'll either not say anything or give me a look or tell me what they really think about something.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  Because why wouldn't they, you know, that's, that's, it's not their job to spin things. And what I've heard talking to people who've been had firsthand experience with face ID is that it works great.
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:55.560]  It is like the facial identity, you know, facial equivalent of touch ID. Once you get used to it, you can't go back.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:12.560]  And all of the people who are worried that this is going to suck, and I really think Samsung in particular really pissed in the well on this one by shipping a shitty camera-based face ID feature years ago, which could be spoofed by like a printout of a photo of you.
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:22.560]  And which Samsung, knowing that it wasn't all that secure, wouldn't let you do things like authorize payments with it, you know, like it was only really used for like unlocking the phone.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:36.560]  Yeah. And they warn you that it's like a convenience feature, not a security feature and all this stuff. But that's not the way people absorb that. You know, they just say, oh, face ID, you know, facial recognition. That's it. All phones in the same blanket.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:48.560]  Can I vouch for it firsthand? No, because I have never once used face ID because I couldn't set it up in the hands-on area on a demo phone and I don't have a iPhone X yet.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:56.560]  You know, I can't vouch for it. But based on what I've seen and seeing people who do have it, you know, use it, it really just works.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:09.560]  And the analogy is I brought it up with Federighi and I really think it's true is it seems to me like it's exactly like the way with the original iPhone back in our naive days where people didn't even lock their phones.
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:18.560]  And it was just you'd wake the phone and there was a nice little thing there, swipe to unlock and you swiped it and you were in and now you just pick up your phone.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  And because of the what's the name of the feature where it wakes up, the phone wakes up just by the accelerometer, whatever they call it.
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:34.560]  But you don't even have to hit the power button. Now your phone just the screen turns on because it sees that you've picked it up and you just swipe up from the bottom and you're in.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:42.560]  You don't have to think about the face ID part because you just look at it and the face ID happens and you just swipe up and you're in. It seems great.
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:12:05.560]  Yeah. And that moment of first unlock or whatever, that's the only thing that's really going to convince anybody. You could say it, so you're blue in the face, you can ask people and I ask people too and they were very positive about their experience over weeks or months, but none of that really matters.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:18.560]  And I think that they have, if anything, is probably making, you know, Federighi grit his teeth over the next four weeks is that people haven't tried it and they're already assuming that it's crap.
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:26.560]  And they're doing that because of the institutional knowledge they have from unreliable systems of other types, you know, of this that are in the same bucket.
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  Which iPhone 10 do you think looks better?
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:43.560]  It's a hard one, but I don't know, I'll probably have to go with black. I just like the glass because I'm a jet user, you know, so like the jet, it's the same thing as the jet for me because it's all black.
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:55.560]  I'm gonna get black, but I've always gotten black and I always will get black, but there's a part of me that wishes that the black one had the same chrome sides as the white one.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:02.560]  Because I really kind of like that pure chrome stainless steel look on the first one.
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.560]  And it's not chrome, it is stainless steel, but it looks like chrome.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.560]  And that's stainless steel, so it's not a coating or anything like that, it's just stainless steel.
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  Yeah, I'm using chrome in the terms of that it's just that sort of shiny, pure steel colored steel as opposed to the black, you know, on the black one the sides are darkened somehow.
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.560]  It's space black or whatever, space gray, whatever they're calling it.
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:29.560]  They both look good and it's a very, very close call. I've never bought a white one.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  But the fact that the face on both is black at least puts it into play for me that I would maybe get the white one, but boy that really does look good.
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:42.560]  I don't have anything else on iPhone 10. I'm ready to move on.
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:43.560]  Yep.
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:47.560]  All right, let me thank our third sponsor of the show, it's our good friends at Audible.

[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:36.560]  I don't have nearly as much to say about the other products that were announced. I think they're interesting. If we go backwards, what would be next? I guess the one I got an hour and a half on the on the old watch bands. I got time.
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:56.560]  I guess the what was first watch, I guess. So I guess if we're going to go backwards, it would be Apple TV 4k. Apple TV 4k is Apple TV. It is faster because it has I think it has the 810 now. And it supports 4k. And Apple is working with the studios to get all of the movies, you know, in iTunes at 4k.
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:09.560]  And they've already got Netflix at 4k. And they put a rubber ring around the menu button on the remote. Oh, yeah. I was wondering what that white thing was. So that's it.
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:25.560]  So that's how they have fixed everybody's complaints about the remote control is they put a white rubber ring around the menu button. So it does feel different. It's not just painted on there is a sort of like it's a physical thing. Yeah, it's a physical like rubbery ring around it.
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:39.560]  And I guess that the theory is that helps orientation, right? Like, so you know what direction you're grabbing it in. But that was never really my problem is that it's as slippery as hell. And like, you can't really control it well.
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:17:02.560]  Like swiping and stuff. I really wish that they had made it asymmetric. I don't know how but there should be some way that it is a nice looking remote and but I'm sure there's some way that they could make it somehow like a wedge shape in a way or something that would easily and no matter which way you pick it up would instantly let you know whether it's forward or backwards.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:12.560]  And I feel like now that you've still got to reach for the middle and figure out where menu is, it's better, but it's like the least they could possibly do to improve that remote.
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  Yeah, I don't know, I think a lot of the improvements for the remote for me could come in software, like, you know, a little bit more of a snap to Yeah. Which, you know, I haven't played with the new tv OS. So maybe there is but it was just like I have a lot of problems with the how fast it scrolls and how much of a snap there is, as I'm never sure how far over to move my thumb and you know, all of that. I don't know, it's just not a very good remote.
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:56.560]  Yeah, I'm not surprised that Apple did this. But to me, the nicest part of the announcement is that if you've already bought movies in HD, when those movies that you've already bought get 4k versions, you'll get 4k versions of them because you've already bought them, you don't have to worry about it.
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:21.560]  And I feel as somebody who has personally pretty much entirely shifted from buying blu rays to just just buying movies on iTunes, just out of convenience. It is, I'm very thankful for that, because that wouldn't be the case with the blu rays, right? Like I'm going to get better looking all those movies that I've bought on iTunes instead of buying the blu ray.
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  I don't have a 4k TV yet, but when I do, I'm going to get a better picture than I would if I were still, you know, getting up and physically putting discs in a player.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:52.560]  Or if I had done the, something I've never done was do the whole thing where you rip them and somehow set up a media server in your house, like, you know, upscaled 1080 is never going to look as good as 4k downloaded from streamed from iTunes. So hooray to Apple for doing that.
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:19:09.560]  Yeah, that was easily, I feel the best like feature of the Apple TV 4k, right? Because like, you know, 4k is a standard and yes, Apple can argue, and I'm sure they will, that their implementation of it is like pristine and they're doing a good job, all this blah, blah, blah.
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:34.560]  But 4k is really a sort of binary choice in a media player. If your bit rates are strong, if your FPS is high, you know, your Hertz is high, you're looking at 4k, 60 Hertz, HDR in both acceptable formats, Dolby Vision and HD 10. Dolby Vision is sort of a super set of HD 10, but it all pans out to whatever your TV supports.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:55.560]  As long as you're doing all those things right correctly, then it is what it is. Like, great, you made yourself a relevant player for the next couple of years as 4k takes off, right? So good, good job. Like, thank you. But the treat, the flourish, the reveal is that deal.
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:20:22.560]  You know, that whoever at EQ deal, you know, where it's like, oh, this is the promise of digital, you buy a thing and it evolves with technology. You don't buy a physical copy and have to rebuy a physical copy. And I'm sure that the arguments that arm wrestles over the people not rebuying with the studios were epic, you know, I'm sure they were as evidenced by the fact that Disney didn't buy in.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:52.440]  Right. So Disney is not currently sold on that idea, right? The king of the back catalog, really, you know, right? Really? Exactly. Right. Like the re releasing and and they were resistant from home video right from the beginning. I mean, they because they had this sort of historical strategy, like I'm revealing my age because I don't, you know, just sounds ridiculous by today's standards. But when, when I was a kid, what Disney would do is, you know, like, I remember going to see
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:21:15.440]  Dumbo in the theater, and Dumbo was made in like, I don't know, like 1940 something, I think, and and every like 10 years, they would make a big deal and reissue one of the classics from their back catalog with all of the promotional fanfare of a new release, you know, TV commercials. And it just like a first run release, like here, we're going to put up Dumbo, you know, this summer, you can go see Dumbo.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:44.560]  And, you know, made tons of money over but that way, like, as a kid who was born in 1973, like I grew up and saw, like Dumbo and Bambi and I vividly remember Pinocchio Pinocchio I frickin loved because like that whole I don't know, I won't get into it. But man, oh, man, Pinocchio blew me away because it was so dark, right? Like, yep, really dark. I was like, I can't believe this. Like, this is like, it's like the sickest This movie is sick.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:51.000]  Like David David Lynch, fairy tale, I guess. Yeah, that movie is fucked up.
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:22:20.760]  I remember my sister was like, my sister's two years younger than me, and she was like, messed up. And I but I loved it. But you, I saw all those movies in the theater. So they were resistant to it. And I could see why they're resistant to it now. But to me, the argument is, look, times change. You know what I mean? Like, just just in the same way that like VHS and home home movies changed. It changed the world, you know, in the 80s. And everybody had to get on board eventually, like streaming services, like
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:43.560]  Netflix, Netflix, just to say Netflix, but you know, Netflix and all of the other Netflix like services around the world have changed things where there are fewer people who buy movies. Now, there's a lot of people who, if they're going to watch something, they just go to Netflix and watch the most interesting thing that Netflix has available to them. And that's it. And the idea of paying
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:23:02.840]  499 to rent a movie or, you know, $15 or whatever to buy a copy of the movie so they can watch it multiple times just never even doesn't does not compute. So I feel like for those of us like me, who are perfectly willing and happy to spend $15 to buy a copy of a movie that I know I want to watch several times.
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:32.000]  You should work to keep me in that camp as opposed to making me feel like a schmuck who has to spend another $15 or $20 to buy a movie I just bought two years ago. Yeah, because you're going to be making more movies and I'm going to buy those right. Like and that's the best way I can say it. Like if I have to spend $20 to get a 4k version of a movie that I've already purchased from iTunes for $20 I'm going to feel like a schmuck do it. I'm either not going to do it and just watch it to make me feel like a schmuck.
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:42.840]  Or if I start watching it upscaled and I'm annoyed, I'm going to feel like a schmuck coughing up that 20 bucks. And I feel like making me feel like a schmuck is not a good way to encourage me to keep doing what I'm doing.
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:24:12.720]  Right. Yep, I agree. And so hopefully they'll come around. I mean, there's also they've got Disney, by the way, it's what I'm referring to. But they've also got that the movie streaming service, you know, that they're launching and like there, you know, so there's a lot of variables and I get it, but it seems like they should, you know, should come around. But the the fact that we got so much of it right off the bat, and that I'll be able to, and you know, you and I and everybody who buys one will be able to launch their catalog and they'll be able to do that.
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:42.800]  Start watching super crisp 4k stuff as long as their TV is already 4k. That's great. And I think that there is a little bit of market pressure built up and that people who have been replacing their TVs over the last couple of years and if they did, they probably got 4k. You know, it was pretty expensive to buy a 4k TV in like, I don't know, 2014, 2013, 2014. But it hasn't really been off the charts expensive in a while now. You know, you can you can get a 4k TV starting at 350 bucks if you're prepared for it not to be such a great 4k TV.
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:25:12.600]  You know, but the even the high end ones are still a couple of grand not not 10,000. Right? Yeah, it's entering it to me. I know that Apple's not Apple TV debuting right now is not the first 4k box that you can connect to your TV. But to me, it feels like they they timed this perfectly fall 2017 is exactly the right time for Apple to have a 4k Apple TV. Like I don't think they're late to this at all. Because I feel like you said like the the prices on actual 4k TVs.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:42.520]  are now entering normal people's you know, this is what I feel like is a reasonable amount to spend on a TV. And if they came out next year, I feel like it would be too late. So I feel like the timing is right for sure. I don't have anything I guess there's the whole sports angle, which is obviously you know, that's really the only content thing other than you know, getting movies into 4k but the only real content angle on Apple TV or at least I guess it's more of a tv OS thing was the sports angle, which I think is interesting as a
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:26:02.040]  sports fan, but we'll see. You know, it certainly is one angle. It's the one thing that they talked about on stage that was about getting people to switch from watching regular cable TV to watching TV, normal, you know, TV network content through Apple TV instead.
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:31.960]  Mm hmm. Right. Yeah, it, the enhanced version of TV that everybody's been trying to sell everybody forever. You know, here, this was their concession to that, or their nod to that in this keynote in this release cycle. It looks cool. I mean, I think that they, you know, they executed right from what I could see on the sports side of things. Like, Oh, yeah, what's the score? Or I could turn the scores off if I don't want to see it.
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:58.080]  See them or, you know that I could see where in the game this is. So I know if I want to tune in or not. Those are all things that the NFL has already proven out that people want with like red zone and stuff like that and then and the big dish packages until you get a major league to sign it and sign on to that and to sign on to the kinds of enhancements you want to deliver beyond just that little score thumbnail.
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:24.640]  You know, if you want running stats while the thing is open and all that, like some of the apps are to do like MLB's app already does it. But, you know, when once it's built into the TV OS level, because those, you know, MLB only built that really nice, cool app so that you buy a subscription. Yeah. Like the the fact that it's a nice, cool app is a byproduct. You know what? Thank you. Right. If we're building a good app, but in reality, they want you to subscribe, which is legit. Like that's their business.
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:53.840]  So if Apple could say, look, what if we get you the same amount of subscribers, but we want to build a lot of those features directly into the OS. I don't think you're going to find too many objections there. So it's just a matter of getting the sign on. And so right now, I believe the way it works is just it's apps that A, enable this hook or whatever, and then B, that have live streams in them. So it's pulling from whatever apps already do live stream. There's not an additional detail.
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:16.000]  Being cut here to like provide live streaming directly to Apple TV or any of that. It's just being pulled out of the apps and then this overlay is being put on top of it. And when you click on one of them, it takes you to that app to watch it or whatever, which is fine. You know, it's it's a way to get it done now. But it just if you look at it, it just gives you that glimpse of the future.
[02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:43.200]  That I'm I've always been convinced is what the whole I you know, I think I've cracked it thing is about what Steve said about the Apple TV, which is that it completely agnostic experience. So whatever you want to watch whenever you want to watch it from whatever source, it's all available in one interface built by people who are interface builders, not by a network or a service or whatever.
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:29:12.400]  And it's just like you go like a little, you know, I want to watch Little House on the Prairie right now. And the system says, Oh, well, you have access to Little House on the Prairie free. So I'm just going to start playing it for you. And if the system says, Oh, you don't have a Little House on the Prairie, any services, none of the services that that you sign are signed in for, or your single sign on has Little House on the Prairie. Here's six options to buy it, you know, and click on one and, you know, face ID that or touch ID that or, you know, whatever and boom, you're on it.
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:28.000]  And I think that that that like confidence level of, of being able to deliver you a multitude of different content across a bunch of different networks all in one interface. You know, it's just so far away yet, because of the deals.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:57.600]  Yeah, because of the it is, it is better than it used to be, though. I mean, and in our family, we watch, we like to watch movies, the three of us and, and it is our our habit now that if we decide upon a movie, if we know if we don't just browsing, and then like, Oh, yeah, let's watch that one as we browse, if we have a movie in mind, we speak it to Siri on the Apple TV, just to see if we can already get it from Netflix or Hulu, where we have subscriptions for free before we spend money doing it. And it really does work great. And
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:19.800]  it's, you know, it's it's become a habit. And let me take this moment, I have a bit of follow up from a previous show. It's a last two episodes ago, counting the Craig Federighi show with with Jim Dalrymple. I pronounced the the ROKU competitor to Apple TV, I pronounced it rock you. And it's in fact, pronounced Roku. And the funny
[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:49.400]  announced it rock you? Yes. And the Wow, the funny part about it, the funny part of good name. Well, the funny part about it is, at least a year ago or more, I mentioned it on the show, and I called it rock you. And I got the feedback from listeners that I don't they always say like, I don't know if you're just fucking with me or what. But in the first time I did it, I did think it was called rock you. I just I looked at it and thought it was rock you.
[02:30:49.960 --> 02:31:15.640]  And when I said it with Jim, last week, I my my instinct was to pronounce it Roku. And I thought, wait, but I know I pronounced it wrong. I better say it the other way around. And so I said rock you thinking that I was correcting myself. But in fact, I had internalized the Roku pronunciation, but my apologize to everyone. And but that really was my thought process. And I'm not screwing with you.
[02:31:15.640 --> 02:31:39.880]  I don't have anything else on Apple TV. We're going long here. We have Apple Watch to talk about. I don't have a lot to say about it. I mean, it's, I think it's I think the whole cellular thing is is I didn't even set it on stage. This was our vision from the beginning, like, and I'm not saying they shipped it too early. I'm not saying they should have waited until now.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:32:09.800]  And in the big picture, I do feel I feel like Apple Watch gets such a bad rap. And I'm not the biggest fan of Apple Watch. I didn't even take mine to California because I thought I know it was I don't want to have the charger. I don't know. So I just, you know, and I have mechanical watches that I like and love. And so it no matter what I like to switch my watch around. And but I see so many people wearing Apple Watch on a daily basis. I can't believe that it that people try to crack jokes about it because the Apple Watch is so much better than the Apple Watch.
[02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:39.160]  The thing that there's the whole thing where the Boston Red Sox were caught using an Apple Watch in a dugout as part of a scheme to steal signals from other teams. And the joke that was on Twitter with like 12,000 retweets and all sorts of likes was the real story here is that somebody finally found a use for Apple Watch and and people want to believe that and they but I can't believe it because I know so many people who it is their fitness tracker of choice and who right, you know, it's true that
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:33:09.360]  it was more ambitious at the start and and they they weren't sure what it was good for. And they talked more about apps and going to that honeycomb app screen and launching apps. And it you know, they've narrowed it down to the two obvious things that the watch is really good for which is notifications and fitness tracking. And they keep making both of those better. And I see so many just regular people on the streets of Philadelphia or San Francisco or the airport who are wearing Apple Watch.
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:39.320]  It's it's super popular. And it Cook even said in the thing that it's now presumably by revenue. They never say when they have this list of top watches in Apple is, you know, was number two behind Rolex. If Rolex was number one, it has to be revenue because it can't be quantity because there's no way Rolex is the number one watch by by quantity has to be by revenue. And however, they've, you know, computed this, they now are the number one watch company by revenue, presumably in the world.
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:54.480]  I, I don't get I don't get the hate on Apple Watch. Like I totally get it if you're not into it. I like I said, I'm personally not super into it. I like it. I really love the unlock my Mac with it feature, which is why I wear it usually like on a work day killer.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:34:13.680]  Yeah. So the way I look at it, it's like, you know, I agree with you completely. Obviously, this has been done gone over ad nauseum by a lot of smart people that, you know, they were sort of we don't know what people are going to like, you know, initially when they launched it, and we don't know which portion of this is the killer feature.
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:27.840]  And over the last two generations, they have figured it out. It's fitness. Fitness is the killer feature, period. The rest of the stuff is icing. And that icing is getting good. You know, there's some good stuff about that icing the honestly, the cellular addition is another piece of icing.
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:55.840]  It's like, hey, take your workouts, and take the anxiety you have of being away from your phone, so that your your kids preschool calls, you don't have to, you know, you're not in the middle of your run. And you're got your phone flapping against your leg the whole time, because you're just convinced that some emergency might happen. Boom, you got it right on your wrist, you can at least call and say, Okay, cool, I'm gonna get in my car, and I'll be right over or whatever. I'm coming back. And it takes a layer of anxiety of being separated from your phone out of it.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:08.320]  Which, whatever you want to say about modern life, I don't care. But people are addicted to their phones, and not just because they want to waste time on them, but because they connect them to the rest of the world, their families, and all of that.
[02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:37.040]  You and I were talking about this last week, but I'll repeat it for everybody who wasn't in your car with us. But I realized that from 1000s of years, mankind survived with children, wherein you couldn't communicate with them. If you were out of earshot, right? Like, you'd only find out how your kid was doing if you were within the distance where you could hear them, or they could hear you. And I think that's the thing.
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:54.240]  You hear you. And exactly, we survived. But guess what, how do you get them to come home? You yell, you hold, a lot of kids did die, though, during those 1000s of years, like, I'm not a worry war parent. I don't think my wife is either. I think we're maybe even more relaxed than many of our peers.
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:36:24.000]  But we do live in a cell phone world now. And now that we have them, it is like, so my example is that Amy's not super into this stuff of, you know, why would she be? But you know, we've been out to dinner before the last weekend before I flew out. And just as part of the conversation, I just sort of gave an overview of what we expected. I mean, pretty much came up in the context of that leak from the the OSGM. And like, here's, here's what we already know. And,
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:54.160]  when I said that, I think, you know, it looks like Apple Watch is going to get cellular. And the way I think it will work is you'll just pair it with your phone, and you won't have to worry about it. I guessed how it was actually going to work where you don't get a new phone number, and people have to call your watch, you just separate yourself from your phone. And she said, so you mean I could go to the gym, and, you know, leave my phone in the locker. And if the school calls my, it'll come to my wrist. And I said, yes. And she goes, Well, then I need that, you know, like, so for example, she still has an Apple
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:24.080]  Watch, original Apple Watch. And when Apple Watch two came out last year, she saw no reason to upgrade. And now as soon as she heard this, she instantly was like, Well, I need that. And and specifically in the context of like a week, like last week, where I was going to be away for a couple days. Because ordinarily, like, you know, she doesn't feel so bad being away from her phone, you know, where her phone's in the locker at the gym, and she's upstairs, because she knows that if something happens, they're going to call me too. And I'm, you know, around. But like last week, when I'm
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:41.080]  in California, it's just, you know, low level anxiety, you know, it's not like she, you know, refuses to go to the gym. If I'm in California, it's just though, that in the back of her head, she's like, I'm so you know, in the back of her head, she's worried that her phone is going off in her locker downstairs. I think it's a killer feature. I really do.
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:38:10.080]  Yeah, I do too. And I think that that addition of that layer of anxiety pill or removal or whatever, is going to appeal to a lot of people. Because as Apple said, like, this is their vision, whatever. It feels logical. Like it just feels logical that this computer on your wrist should be independent. You know, the tether model is going to the dogs or by the wayside or whatever analogy you want to use.
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:40.080]  The tether model is gone, right? You know, this whole idea of like this thing has to exist in conjunction with this other thing. About the only thing I think is going to really be pervasive over the next couple of years is AirPods because they they're just they don't know how to make them independent yet. You know, but at some point, if you could put an AirPod in and stream Apple Music directly to it, like maybe the case is the cellular radio, as long as you have the case in your pocket, because you got to have that any way to charge, you know, and then it streams to your AirPods.
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:39:02.080]  Or whatever, I don't know what the hell they're gonna do, you know, but I could see them making them independent or wanting to. And so the watch is always felt that way. It's always felt logical to have a cellular radio in there. Now they figured out how to do it, while making the watch exactly the same thickness and then a little bump on the back, like a millimeters or a millimeter bigger or something less.
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:29.080]  I thought that he said a tiny bit bigger. I have to rewatch it. I could swear that what he said was that it's two tenths of one millimeter thicker. I think I say a couple of millimeters, but yeah, it was not that it was smaller than and if that's literally what Jeff Williams said again, hats off to Apple for having the integrity of actually admitting it publicly, you know, because I think two tenths of one millimeter you could legitimately get away with. It's the exact same size.
[02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:40.080]  Whereas two millimeters. You get the guy with this caliper. Right. Starting a class action lawsuit. Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:40:00.080]  Yeah, you know, let's acknowledge it. It's it's reasonably priced, but it isn't cheap. Like it seems like most of the carriers are going to charge you ten dollars a month for the privilege of using this. So that is one hundred and twenty dollars a year that you're just, you know, in addition to the four hundred bucks you pay for the watch in the first place.
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:14.080]  You know, that is in some ways it makes it a premium product. But I thought, you know, I'm not surprised by that at all. I thought no way in hell is any carrier going to let you do this for free.
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:24.080]  And it seems to me like in my experience with AT&T and Verizon, anytime you want to add a quote unquote, add a device to a plan, it's ten bucks.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:41.080]  Yeah. So it is what it is, but am I going to get one? I don't know, because I don't wear it every day. I don't know. But Amy was a sure thing. A hundred percent. I'm on you know, she's on board and I think I probably will too.
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:55.080]  What about the red dot? I get it, but I don't get it. I wish it wasn't there. And I think it's going to be silly with some bands. I just think it's not a great choice, to be honest.
[02:40:55.080 --> 02:41:08.080]  Like it's there to differentiate the cellular watch. But in my opinion, the cellular watch is differentiated by the fact that it's cellular. I don't know what their vision is that people have multiple watches and they want to make sure to grab the cellular one. I don't know.
[02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:25.080]  I don't get it. I did notice in person that it isn't I mean, it's obviously red if you're looking for it, but it doesn't seem to jump out as much as it does in some of their photos. But exactly for the reason you just said, like black is a neutral color.
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:51.080]  It's, you know, arguably the neutral color. And so like having black on that side of the crown goes with every strap you could possibly or and or watch face that you choose. Whereas red is a very I don't know. It doesn't go with everything. I don't hate it. It's not we certainly wouldn't keep me from buying the watch, but I do find it a little curious.
[02:41:51.080 --> 02:42:01.080]  Yeah, I mean, like red goes with a gray band or a black band. And you can even say it might go with like a pink band, but it doesn't go with an orange band.
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:26.080]  Orange is a perfect example, right? It's just it's just a little weird. I don't know. So Tim Cook's been wearing and I've seen just a handful of other Apple exists, but Cook's is the one who's conspicuous because it's been photographed. He's been photographed with a stainless steel Apple watch with a red thing on the crown for like, I don't know, like a year and a half, like from even before series two.
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:40.080]  And it's, you know, other people have noticed this. Like, do you think he's been wearing a prototype cellular watch for in 18 months? Or do you think red just used to mean special? Because the the original edition gold ones had red red there, too.
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:51.080]  I think it was just something special. I don't think he had a prototype cellular one. I think it's possible, but I feel like I feel like there's the engineering couldn't have been there back then, even at a prototype level.
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:58.080]  I think it's a little far out. Yes, my gut. That's just a gut feeling. Yeah.
[02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:01.080]  Anything else on Apple Watch?
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:21.080]  I will say this. There was a black, the older the first generation of the nylon, their nylon watch straps, woven nylon. There was a black one that I bought, which is my favorite Apple Watch strap ever. Both. I just like the way it looks. And I also find it extremely comfortable in all weather and situations.
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:39.080]  And in fact, I've worn it so much that it's it's worn a little bit like it doesn't look bad, but it's obviously showing a little bit aware. And I've been thinking in the back of my head, I should buy another one of those just to have it because I think that all of these type of straps, you know, are limited edition.
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:49.080]  And lo and behold, come and go. Yeah, lo and behold, that one's gone. But I did find one the other day on Best Buy.com was still selling them. So I quick ordered one.
[02:43:49.080 --> 02:44:05.080]  But I think it's I think that they're totally I think that that must be if you're like a designer, I would I think that must be such a fun team to work on because I feel like they are having so much fun doing like a variety of watch straps that change every six months.
[02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:14.080]  Like and really running the gamut from playful to subtle to elegant.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:19.080]  Yeah, well, the new Velcro ones they showed off there.
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:33.080]  You know, it's just it's it just makes sense that if Apple's going to do a Velcro watch, the entire band's Velcro. Right. Like the entire band is the loop. Right. The Velcro hooks to the loop material.
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:48.080]  It's not a patch. Almost every Velcro watch is there's a patch of contact material. It's the loops. And then you have the Velcro hook material on the other side. And the Apple way is to go like, nope, we're going to make the entire thing loop.
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:57.080]  So you can attach it anywhere you want. And they know most of the band's not going to be used. Right. But at the same time, it gives them infinity stability and and continuity of look.
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:11.080]  You know, the whole thing looks the same. I am what I felt there. It's kind of fuzzy. Yeah, it feels very nice. I'm not a Velcro kind of guy, but I have to say that it's the nicest Velcro I've ever seen in my life by far.
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:16.080]  It's the first time I've ever seen Velcro and thought, this is really nice Velcro.
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:21.080]  In fact, I even wonder, is Velcro like a trademark like Kleenex?
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:34.080]  I wonder if it even that's a good question. I don't know. I wonder if it technically is Velcro with a trademark or whether it's like a Velcro like, you know, scratchy side on one day and soft side on the other.
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:41.080]  I mean, it is definitely a registered trademark Velcro. So, yeah, I think you have to use like hook and loop fasteners or something.
[02:45:41.080 --> 02:45:52.080]  Yeah. All right. Well, I'm about at the end of my list. There was one last thing in the keynote. Oh, I guess we could talk about the opening Steve Jobs tribute if we're going to go backwards. I mean, and there's the angel orange thing.
[02:45:52.080 --> 02:46:01.080]  The angel orange thing was interesting. I don't know what else to say about it, though. I mean, it's like, you know, here's their new flagship stores. They are architecturally fantastic.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:19.080]  They are obviously of the same architectural design language as the Steve Jobs theater itself and the new campus. You know, it's it's obviously one cohesive architectural language that they're using around the world, including at their campus.
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.080]  But, you know, I don't know what else to say other than that.
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:26.080]  Yeah, I mean, I think there's some controversy over calling it town halls or whatever.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:43.080]  Or town squares. There you go. And I mean, I'm not the right person to debate, you know, civic responsibility and, you know, adoption of those things, co-option of those things by corporations.
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:47:12.080]  I get the arguments. I don't know. It didn't strike me as particularly egregious, but there, you know, some people are getting all mad about it. But I think that they're already if you go to like the one in San Francisco that is already converted over to that new model of that town square model or whatever, whereas like indoor out as the as the the patio area and the big doors that open so people can walk through it and all that stuff.
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:23.080]  Like I get it. They're co-opting something that is theoretically public space, but it is private property and it is a corporate drive. They're trying to sell products and all that stuff.
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:34.080]  But I think they did a pretty decent job of making those things feel like they had a variety to them that didn't exist in Apple stores before.
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:42.080]  I think it did at one point, like when a lot of the stores had theaters and stuff like that, you felt like there was always something going on. You could go there and see.
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:54.080]  But I think it hasn't felt like that in a while. And I think that you're you're now kind of seeing them try to return to that a little bit and bring back the fact that like, hey, you got other things to do here than just buy stuff.
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:48:08.080]  I don't get the controversy over it. I feel like it doesn't matter which company it is, but if you have a retail space, you can either have it be like you're either make it feel like you're either in here to buy something or you can either come here to buy something.
[02:48:08.080 --> 02:48:18.080]  Or you can be on our property for a free reason to see a show or to have a class or just to hang out and sit on a bench and feel welcome doing it.
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:26.080]  So I don't see how that that ladder is worse than the former, right? Like, how is that not better?
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:38.080]  And secondarily, I don't think that it was implied in any way that they're going around and telling cities around the world, like, get rid of your public parks. We'll take care of it.
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:48.080]  You know, they're not trying to replace public parks. You know, they're saying that in addition to the public parks that these cities already have, we're going to have a space that's welcome to the people. I don't get it.
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:52.080]  So, yeah, I thought it was really great to see her on the stage.
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:49:17.080]  Yes, it did be really nice to see her out there. Yeah, that was it was the answer to the long standing question of when when is Angela Arens going to be on stage at an event? A cynical part of my mind says that maybe, you know, there's a if not for Angela Arens, I don't think there would have been any women from Apple on stage at that event, unless I'm forgetting somebody who did a demo, but I don't think so.
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:28.080]  Because it was truly the only the only but it wasn't like there was a cavalcade of men either. It was really just Cook Schiller, Federighi Q, and Jeff Williams.
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:41.080]  And and, you know, as I said, I was I've said many times, they don't pick people to do the segments that the people who come out for these segments of the people who are in charge of them, you know, and so Angela Arens isn't going to be on stage until they decide to speak about retail on stage.
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:52.080]  And lo and behold, what she was there to talk about was retail, but she was super great. That's that's the thing. People have been itching to see her on stage because they've seen her speak in public places on videos and stuff before.
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:50:01.080]  And she's obviously a very dynamic, engaging personality. And so, you know, it, you know, the capability was obviously there.
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:29.080]  And I think the people in the fashion world who knew her before, you know, as the CEO of bribery, and then also the people who are paid to sort of think about this things and know these things know that, you know, she was the CEO of a major fashion corporation and effectively took a what you would might consider a downgrade in position, but certainly an upgraded, outsized impact and influence and right and size of job, I think size of job wise, bigger job, you know, hands down.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:44.080]  Yeah, but the it was good to see her out there because I think that she's just like an enormously capable executive and has been doing a lot and getting her to present her work or getting, you know, getting to see her present her work is always a treat.
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:52.080]  It's always nice to see people, as you said, who have done the work and who have been in the trenches working on a product, you know, present that product.
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:51:04.080]  And I think she it showed that she was she had done a bunch of presentations around the world. I've been at a couple of one of them. She did local presentations at the stores themselves.
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:10.080]  And she's been doing some of that, but we hadn't seen her on the stage proper. And I think she, you know, she felt very comfortable up there.
[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:14.080]  And obviously, you know, was presenting things she had worked on closely.
[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:22.080]  I found this interesting link, this fashion blog called The Fashion Law had written about her out there.
[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:29.080]  And they were, you know, obviously saying, you know, she's an executive who's presenting her work and all that went really well.
[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:33.080]  But they they pulled some like fashion marketplace or whatever.
[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:49.080]  And this one fashion marketplace said that, you know, during and for two hours after the time she was on stage, users search for and viewed that pale pink Burberry trench coat that she was wearing a lace one every 12 seconds.
[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:58.080]  And it like searches on the platform on this list platform was for the terms lace pink and trench coat grew by eight hundred and thirty percent.
[02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:00.080]  That's absolutely amazing.
[02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:10.080]  It's not that she's just out there giving this presentation. She's out there like, I'm a fashionable trendsetting, you know, woman who is also an executive at this company.
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:16.080]  And I'm not going to come out here and like, you know, try to untuck my shirt or whatever. Like, I'm going to dress how I dress.
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:19.080]  You know, I'm going to dress how I how I feel comfortable.
[02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:23.080]  And I think there was some nice resonance there with people.
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:44.080]  Can I now is as good a time as ever to bring it up, but I find it so funny personally because, you know, those of you who are longtime followers of me on Twitter, I had a habit for years of when I would go in the keynote and when speakers would come out, I would note who had worn their shirts tucked and untucked and keep a tally for each keynote.
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:53:00.080]  And I gave it up at some point around two years ago. And because I realized it was completely biased towards men because it doesn't, you know, and I've you know, it's just one of the way, you know, one of the ways that I'm trying to be more cognizant of that.
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:03.080]  And it doesn't seem fair to to keep track of it.
[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:09.080]  I'll only keep track of it for men and not women. And it's different. So I just don't do it anymore. But I used to here in Philadelphia.
[02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:15.080]  We have a nice Apple store on Walnut Street. And right next door to it was an American Apparel.
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:19.080]  Well, American Apparel went bankrupt and closed all their retail stores.
[02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:24.080]  The store that took over that space literally right next to the Apple Store.
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:41.080]  Untuck it. Wait, wait, let me guess. I was just going to say it's untuck it, huh? I'm so sorry I spoiled it for you. Untuck it. I will put a photo in the show notes. I will link to a photo of the untuck it next to the Apple Store, which it amuses me to no end.
[02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:47.080]  So sorry, I spoiled them. That's great. There's one in Soho very near the Apple Store, too.
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:59.080]  And I always see it and laugh. For those of you who don't know, untuck it is a store that the entire point of the store is that they sell shirts that are meant to be worn untucked, which is what it is.
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:02.080]  But anyway, I find it so funny that they open next to the Apple Store.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:10.080]  Yeah, Angela Arnts did great on stage, and I'm sure it won't be the last time that that was here.
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:18.080]  And then the opening last but not least, going backwards would be the opening Steve Jobs tribute, which I don't know.
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:22.080]  I don't even know what to say about it other than I thought it was perfect.
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:31.080]  I thought that the the the little passage that we heard of Steve Jobs himself was absolutely fantastic.
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:43.080]  I I've been writing about Apple ever since I started during Fireball, and it so summarizes what it is that I you know, it it puts it.
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:46.080]  He put his finger on what Apple is and why they do what they do.
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:50.080]  Why do they go to the extraordinary lengths that they go to and do the unnecessary?
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:58.080]  You know, why? Why are the handrails cut out in the theater that they're going to use twice a year for keynotes carved out of stone?
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:04.080]  You know, why do they go to these lengths to do things that they don't need to do?
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:10.080]  And it's, you know, to show their appreciation for fellow humans who they're never going to meet, never going to shake.
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:15.080]  I don't want to go out. Just it's just so perfect to me. And I never heard it before.
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:22.080]  I understand what I was told was. Oh, yeah. Well, what did you hear? You tell me.
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:25.080]  Well, I heard that it was from an internal company meeting. Right.
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:30.080]  And that it was not it was recorded as the internal company meeting and had never been heard outside of the company anywhere.
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:37.080]  And I don't even think that it had been replayed, maybe, you know, since then or I didn't get that vibe that it was like, oh, we listen to it all the time.
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:45.080]  I think they discovered it, maybe uncovered it or somebody remembered it because there are obviously many people worked with them for years at Apple that are still there.
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:50.080]  But it was an internal meeting, speaking to employees off the cuff unprepared.
[02:55:50.080 --> 02:56:01.080]  This was not a speech he was giving, you know, or something where it was prepared externally to, like, talk to press or talk to, you know, even a graduating class or any of that jazz.
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:04.080]  This was just an internal meeting talking to employees about why they did what they did.
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:13.080]  I haven't said I was told the exact same thing. So, as usual, I think Apple actually had a prepared answer ready for probably I have a theory.
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:23.080]  Now, this I have no little birdie. I was told only what you were told. But my theory is maybe that was from one of those top 100 meetings.
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:34.080]  You know, that Steve Jobs started a tradition where once a year, I think around May, Apple holds a offsite like over a weekend for what they call that.
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:37.080]  It's like the top 100 and its executives and managers.
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:45.080]  And it's, you know, 100 people from within the company who are considered like, here's the best, you know, here's here's our top 100 leaders within the company.
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:49.080]  And we're going to and they go and they review product plans for the next year.
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:54.080]  And who knows what else? But it's obvious, shockingly, very secret.
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:58.080]  Obviously, you know, politically inside the company, it's a sign that you are on.
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:05.080]  If if, you know, you get invited for the first time, it's obviously a sign that you're on the fast track to to management.
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:10.080]  I have it. That's my theory is my theory. It was from one of those, perhaps the last one that he intended.
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:15.080]  Maybe. I don't know. Yeah, but it was very, very touching.
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:19.080]  It sounds reasonable as anything. Yeah, because that's the other.
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:23.080]  The only other thing I was told was that, yeah, it was internal meeting, never before public.
[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:26.080]  And I even the other thing I was told, maybe you were told the same thing.
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:31.080]  This would prove that they had it prepared was that most even most Apple employees hadn't heard that before.
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:37.080]  And the even most Apple employees hadn't heard it before was what made me wonder if maybe it was that top 100 meeting.
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:44.080]  Right. Right. But anyway, it was great. And then I thought Tim's Tim Cook's remarks were incredibly touching.
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:50.080]  And, you know, I don't know him personally. I mean, I've spoken to him very briefly a few times.
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:58.080]  But, you know, I don't think he's hard to read. And, you know, I think most people would agree that even just from his public appearances,
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:02.080]  he's he's not really the sort of guy to tear up easily.
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:08.080]  You know, I think he's a pretty hard baked individual, at least in public.
[02:58:08.080 --> 02:58:14.080]  And I think that the emotion that he showed while speaking about Steve was truly profound.
[02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:18.080]  You know, I watered up. We were you and I were sitting next to each other. I don't know.
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:23.080]  I watered up. I mean, I didn't have tears running down my face, but but they were there.
[02:58:23.080 --> 02:58:28.080]  They were like they were at the starting line.
[02:58:28.080 --> 02:58:39.080]  Yeah, I you got to say you got to think that, you know, sharing something like that with the public for the first time.
[02:58:39.080 --> 02:58:45.080]  You know, there's emotions attached to that. There's emotion attached to the theater that has his name on it.
[02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:47.080]  You know, all of this stuff, some of it was mentioned by them.
[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:53.080]  But you just kind of think like on a personal level, these are still people.
[02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:56.080]  They still worked with one another. They still built relationships with each other.
[02:58:56.080 --> 02:59:06.080]  You know, Steve with his co-workers and his employees and they had a life, you know, lifetime shaking relationships with these people.
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:13.080]  And I think that a lot of times people get hyper cynical about this because like it's a show and it's pomp and circumstance and all of this stuff.
[02:59:13.080 --> 02:59:22.080]  And it's like, yeah, I get it. But it's really only the most hard bitten and cynical of people that can really manipulate people on that level.
[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:28.080]  And if you do that, it'll be evident in the other ways that you do business and the other ways that you conduct yourself.
[02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:34.080]  And so for me, it felt genuine. You know, it felt straightforward. It felt exactly as as it was.
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:47.080]  You know, people in that in that auditorium, many of them, especially the senior people, owe their careers and lives and the ability that they have to impact millions of people to Steve.
[02:59:47.080 --> 03:00:03.080]  And just to be like, hey, here's a tribute to you. You know, hell, if you're going to cry at the end of Fast the Furious when, you know, Vin Diesel drives on one road and and and, you know, Paul drives down the other.
[03:00:03.080 --> 03:00:17.080]  You know, why don't you laugh or why don't you cry when you got to, you know, present you really, really felt love for in that filial, you know, employee way or heck, even friendship way.
[03:00:17.080 --> 03:00:24.080]  Makes sense to me. Yeah, I thought it was really nice. You could feel it. Yeah, you could feel it in the in the auditorium.
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:30.080]  Well, that's it for me. I mean, we were three hours into this for a two hour.
[03:00:30.080 --> 03:00:35.080]  Just just go ahead and cut down to an hour and a half.
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:43.080]  You've got a big week coming up. By the time this airs, you will be knee deep in TechCrunch Disrupt event taking place next week.
[03:00:43.080 --> 03:00:49.080]  And among your featured people on stage is going to be Laurene Powell Jobs.
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:01:01.080]  Yes, that's correct. She'll be on stage talking about various efforts to do with students and technology involving students in tech early and making sure that the pipelines are appropriate.
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:12.080]  She's been an outspoken advocate of DACA, obviously, of the Dreamers Act and maintaining that and keeping those opportunities open for immigrants.
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:23.080]  And then we also have Lisa Jackson. I'll be talking with Lisa Jackson, Apple's head of environment, social issues, former guest on the talk show.
[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:30.080]  That's right. That's right. You've had her before as well. What should I what should I how should I prepare? Is she a hard subject?
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:37.080]  Well, be ready. She's sharp. That's my impression so far. I need to be on my toes.
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:52.080]  You know what? I'm getting one of this week. I think that when she was on the talk show, it was evidence of the same thing I said about Federighi, which is that she clearly understands everything in her domain because she can explain it to someone like me who doesn't know jack squat about this stuff.
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:02:03.080]  Like it's so thoroughly like her explanation for like the environmental design of the new main building at the headquarters was just it was just like, wow, it's like I can't believe you're not an architect.
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:17.080]  So anyway, that's great. So I'll bet and you guys, you guys publish videos of those things, right? Yep. Yeah. So those will be videos that I'm those are two right there that I'm sure listeners of this show will be interested in. So break a leg on the show. Can't can't wait to see those videos.
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:24.080]  Thanks so much. Thanks for having me on and everybody can follow you on Twitter at at panzer panzer.
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:34.080]  You got it. All right. See you soon.
