[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  I'm not naming names, except it was me,
[00:03.200 --> 00:07.020]  but we came home from a trip to Disney World this year
[00:07.020 --> 00:10.560]  and there was a fruit fly situation.
[00:11.500 --> 00:12.660]  Oh no.
[00:12.660 --> 00:14.100]  Two to something.
[00:14.100 --> 00:18.540]  It wasn't bad, it was not a terrible fruit fly infestation,
[00:18.540 --> 00:22.340]  but it was, and it was most definitely my fault.
[00:24.580 --> 00:26.940]  We have people come and feed the cat,
[00:26.940 --> 00:29.460]  so there are at least some people doing basic check
[00:29.460 --> 00:31.700]  on whether there's something disastrous happening
[00:31.700 --> 00:33.800]  in the house when they come in to feed the cat,
[00:33.800 --> 00:34.940]  so that's good.
[00:34.940 --> 00:37.660]  It's like, check on the house, feed the cat,
[00:37.660 --> 00:38.980]  and also make sure that there's nothing.
[00:38.980 --> 00:41.680]  Yeah, we didn't leave a banana on the counter or something.
[00:45.680 --> 00:46.740]  A banana would be the worst.
[00:46.740 --> 00:47.740]  You'd have to move.
[00:49.660 --> 00:52.140]  Yeah, I don't know, because the banana skin is,
[00:52.140 --> 00:54.820]  well, yeah, no, you may be right.
[00:54.820 --> 00:57.580]  We've had other fruits that have rotted in the fruit bowl
[00:57.580 --> 01:00.820]  at the bottom that were worse, where I would walk in.
[01:00.820 --> 01:02.140]  And you know, they're insidious,
[01:02.140 --> 01:04.780]  because you don't really notice it
[01:04.780 --> 01:06.500]  if you're just in the house,
[01:06.500 --> 01:08.980]  but then somebody walks in from out in the world,
[01:08.980 --> 01:11.460]  out in the fresh air, and goes, oh no.
[01:11.460 --> 01:12.540]  Where is that coming from?
[01:12.540 --> 01:15.620]  And that's when you discover that there's a rotten nectarine
[01:15.620 --> 01:16.860]  at the bottom of a fruit bowl.
[01:16.860 --> 01:18.420]  Yeah, it's not good.
[01:18.420 --> 01:20.540]  You know, my wife found a good tip.
[01:20.540 --> 01:23.300]  It's one of those, you don't have to buy anything.
[01:23.300 --> 01:25.180]  It's you use stuff in your own household
[01:25.180 --> 01:27.260]  to solve the problem.
[01:27.260 --> 01:30.140]  There's like a woman who had a whole bunch of those tips.
[01:30.140 --> 01:31.660]  Oh, like hints from Heloise?
[01:31.660 --> 01:33.540]  Yeah, hints from Heloise, right, exactly.
[01:33.540 --> 01:36.300]  I remember as a kid, I didn't know how to pronounce her name.
[01:36.300 --> 01:38.180]  She was a Letterman guest, wasn't she?
[01:38.180 --> 01:39.940]  She was on Letterman a few times, I think.
[01:39.940 --> 01:41.460]  I think she was.
[01:41.460 --> 01:42.780]  So I don't know if this actually comes from her,
[01:42.780 --> 01:43.900]  but it's one of those type of tips.
[01:43.900 --> 01:44.800]  But the way to get rid of,
[01:44.800 --> 01:46.740]  one way to get rid of fruit flies
[01:46.740 --> 01:50.060]  is to fill a wine glass or two with,
[01:50.060 --> 01:51.880]  and the tip says white wine.
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.180]  I don't know if that makes a difference.
[01:53.180 --> 01:56.060]  I doubt it, because, but it at least lets you see them.
[01:56.060 --> 01:59.380]  And then you put a little bit,
[01:59.380 --> 02:03.620]  maybe like an inch of white wine in the glass,
[02:03.620 --> 02:07.020]  and then on the top, just drop gently
[02:07.020 --> 02:09.780]  about two drops of dish detergent.
[02:09.780 --> 02:13.060]  And then the fruit flies are attracted to the wine,
[02:13.060 --> 02:15.540]  but the dish detergent that floats on top
[02:15.540 --> 02:17.540]  is viscous enough that they can't escape.
[02:19.420 --> 02:22.000]  And they get nice and drunk,
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  so you're killing them humanely.
[02:27.100 --> 02:30.100]  I think we did that with vinegar,
[02:31.060 --> 02:33.100]  and like a plastic bag,
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.980]  where you clip the end of a Ziploc bag,
[02:34.980 --> 02:37.120]  and you put it down in the glass with the vinegar below it,
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.120]  and they go down, and then they can't come back out.
[02:40.120 --> 02:42.940]  So that's another homemade fruit fly trap,
[02:42.940 --> 02:44.580]  but we definitely have done that.
[02:48.980 --> 02:50.180]  Anyway, we should get going.
[02:50.180 --> 02:54.580]  We only have limited time, and we have six hours.
[02:54.580 --> 02:55.540]  As much time as you want, yeah.
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.620]  We have six hours of topics to pack into a two-hour show.
[02:57.620 --> 02:58.760]  We do, as usual.
[03:03.480 --> 03:05.980]  Starting out, I'm gonna get some follow-up out of the way.
[03:05.980 --> 03:08.680]  That's what you're supposed to do, a follow-up, right?
[03:08.680 --> 03:11.860]  So a couple episodes ago, I had molts on,
[03:11.860 --> 03:16.740]  and I spoke about my longstanding analogy
[03:16.740 --> 03:20.180]  that I like to use for designing a good interface.
[03:20.180 --> 03:21.620]  And this could be for software.
[03:21.620 --> 03:23.620]  It could even be for hardware products.
[03:23.620 --> 03:25.300]  But I like to think of it as the difference
[03:25.300 --> 03:28.260]  between feeling like you're going uphill or downhill.
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.600]  And a bad interface for something makes you feel
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.460]  like you have to push uphill every step of the way.
[03:34.460 --> 03:37.220]  And a good interface makes you feel
[03:37.220 --> 03:38.260]  like you're going downhill.
[03:38.260 --> 03:41.180]  And one of my favorite examples would be
[03:41.180 --> 03:46.180]  like Fantastical's interface for entering a new date
[03:47.980 --> 03:50.700]  or event, where you can just start typing free form
[03:50.700 --> 03:55.700]  in a field, podcast with Jason, Wednesday at 5.30.
[03:58.060 --> 04:00.540]  And it'll just parse it, and I'll have an event
[04:00.540 --> 04:03.220]  that's named podcast with Jason.
[04:03.220 --> 04:05.460]  It'll correctly interpret Wednesday
[04:05.460 --> 04:07.420]  as meaning the next Wednesday.
[04:07.420 --> 04:10.060]  And 5.30 is 5.30 p.m. instead of a.m.
[04:10.060 --> 04:12.380]  because they're somehow smart enough to know
[04:12.380 --> 04:16.620]  that we're not gonna podcast at 5.30 a.m. Eastern time.
[04:16.620 --> 04:18.460]  Brilliant interface, feels like you're going downhill.
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.960]  It feels like I can't imagine how it would be easier
[04:20.960 --> 04:23.460]  to create an event, whereas going uphill
[04:23.460 --> 04:26.400]  would be like sitting there and having to pick
[04:26.400 --> 04:30.780]  from a date field and bring up a calendar
[04:30.780 --> 04:33.180]  and pick the date and then enter the time manually
[04:33.180 --> 04:36.260]  and have to manually enter a.m. or p.m.
[04:36.260 --> 04:38.100]  and going through all these different fields.
[04:38.100 --> 04:40.780]  Anyway, but I mentioned my frustration with that
[04:40.780 --> 04:44.020]  because, with my analogy, because going downhill
[04:44.020 --> 04:46.060]  also has sort of a negative connotation.
[04:46.060 --> 04:47.780]  If you say, oh man, Daring Fireball's really
[04:47.780 --> 04:51.340]  going downhill lately, most people would interpret
[04:51.340 --> 04:54.560]  that as meaning it's not as good as it used to be.
[04:56.900 --> 05:01.220]  So listener Justin Scott on Twitter, thank you Justin.
[05:01.220 --> 05:06.220]  He suggested that I switch to downstream and upstream.
[05:06.220 --> 05:09.520]  And then you swimming downstream, swimming upstream.
[05:09.520 --> 05:12.240]  And then you lose the second meaning
[05:12.240 --> 05:15.280]  where downhill has a negative connotation.
[05:15.280 --> 05:17.840]  So I'm gonna keep that in mind, I've bookmarked it.
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.040]  I'm gonna try to keep it in my brain
[05:20.040 --> 05:21.480]  because I only bring it up about once a year,
[05:21.480 --> 05:24.560]  but I just wanted to thank him for his clever,
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.440]  can't believe I didn't think of it, suggestion.
[05:28.440 --> 05:30.440]  It's good, you just gotta think about boats
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.960]  more than like walking or riding a bike or something.
[05:32.960 --> 05:33.800]  Yep, exactly.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.620]  That's all.
[05:34.620 --> 05:37.860]  Secondarily, on the last episode with Glenn Fleishman,
[05:42.120 --> 05:46.280]  I went on an angry rant about the Amber Alert system
[05:46.280 --> 05:48.720]  that set your phone off.
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.200]  And a couple of people wrote in to say
[05:50.200 --> 05:52.680]  that that was a little bit cruel or something.
[05:52.680 --> 05:55.200]  And somebody pointed me, I will put this in the show notes
[05:55.200 --> 05:57.720]  that the amberalert.gov website
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.160]  claims to have these statistics.
[05:59.160 --> 06:02.000]  And they claim that 40 children have been rescued
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.480]  because of wireless emergency alerts.
[06:05.480 --> 06:08.040]  I don't know, I started taking a look at their report.
[06:08.040 --> 06:10.440]  They have reports, but the reports only go up to 2015,
[06:10.440 --> 06:12.600]  so I don't know what's going on with 2016.
[06:14.440 --> 06:17.640]  I started reading it, it was just a gobbledygook.
[06:17.640 --> 06:20.040]  So I'll just accept it, I'll say, okay,
[06:20.040 --> 06:22.660]  I'll admit, let's just say 40 kids have been saved,
[06:22.660 --> 06:23.980]  who would have otherwise not been saved?
[06:23.980 --> 06:28.240]  So go amber alerts.
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.820]  Oh, the other followup on that is I heard that,
[06:29.820 --> 06:34.160]  I posited that Apple was legally required to participate.
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.680]  And a couple of people wrote in to say that,
[06:35.680 --> 06:37.780]  no, it's voluntary, but everybody does it.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.600]  That's bad luck if you're like, no, no,
[06:42.600 --> 06:44.840]  you don't want to find missing kids.
[06:44.840 --> 06:47.660]  No, you gotta put that in there.
[06:47.660 --> 06:49.420]  It's sort of implicitly mandatory
[06:49.420 --> 06:53.460]  because it's sort of a bad PR, you know.
[06:53.460 --> 06:54.300]  Yeah.
[06:56.280 --> 06:57.120]  What else?
[06:57.120 --> 06:59.060]  We have one last bit of followup suggested by you.
[06:59.060 --> 07:00.880]  Now, this is pure coincidence.
[07:00.880 --> 07:02.040]  Last time you were on the show,
[07:02.040 --> 07:03.880]  which was quite a while ago, I think,
[07:05.120 --> 07:07.680]  we were talking about old-fashioned keyboards
[07:07.680 --> 07:10.840]  and you had a new mechanical keyboard
[07:10.840 --> 07:12.860]  that you had ordered, or two maybe.
[07:14.080 --> 07:17.160]  And you pointed out, I will put a link to this.
[07:17.160 --> 07:18.320]  I'm afraid I actually don't know
[07:18.320 --> 07:19.400]  how to pronounce its surname.
[07:19.400 --> 07:22.400]  I believe it's Stephen Troughton Smith?
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.240]  Maybe it's Troughton Smith?
[07:23.240 --> 07:25.040]  I say Troughton, Troughton Smith, I think.
[07:25.040 --> 07:28.040]  Yeah, Troughton sounds, I guess, sounds more British.
[07:28.040 --> 07:29.600]  But very good friend of the show,
[07:29.600 --> 07:31.920]  or friend of the website, at least.
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.000]  Expert iOS, I call him like a spelunker,
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.480]  like he digs into the betas.
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.560]  Uncovered all sorts of juicy tidbits
[07:41.560 --> 07:45.880]  from that HomePod iOS release,
[07:45.880 --> 07:47.920]  premature release a couple weeks ago.
[07:47.920 --> 07:49.200]  Anyway, he had preordered,
[07:49.200 --> 07:51.040]  he'd showed me this, actually, privately,
[07:51.040 --> 07:53.800]  at least the plans for it.
[07:53.800 --> 07:56.800]  He preordered, there's a, I forget the company,
[07:56.800 --> 07:58.480]  is it WASD?
[07:58.480 --> 08:00.200]  I think it's W-A-S-D.
[08:00.200 --> 08:02.720]  I just say W-A-S-D, yeah.
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.600]  Do you have one of their keyboards?
[08:04.600 --> 08:07.460]  I don't, I've actually been thinking of getting one,
[08:07.460 --> 08:11.300]  and then I saw Steve Troughton Smith's tweets,
[08:11.300 --> 08:15.360]  and oh boy, I'm gonna have to at some point,
[08:15.360 --> 08:18.040]  because they let you do custom keycaps,
[08:18.040 --> 08:20.680]  and that is, so the one I've got
[08:20.680 --> 08:25.440]  is a weird Chinese keyboard that I like a lot,
[08:25.440 --> 08:29.120]  but it comes with the keys, the keycaps that are on it,
[08:29.120 --> 08:31.280]  and they're really generic Windows keycaps,
[08:31.280 --> 08:35.320]  and the advantage of the WASD is you can order it
[08:35.320 --> 08:38.440]  with custom printing on whatever keycaps,
[08:38.440 --> 08:40.080]  like colors and printing,
[08:40.080 --> 08:41.700]  when you order a keyboard from them.
[08:41.700 --> 08:45.320]  Yeah, so Troughton Smith made his
[08:45.320 --> 08:47.820]  Apple Extended Keyboard 2 style,
[08:47.820 --> 08:50.640]  which is actually the style of a whole era
[08:50.640 --> 08:52.480]  of Apple keyboards.
[08:52.480 --> 08:56.140]  There was a pretty long era of Apple keyboards,
[08:56.140 --> 09:00.160]  pretty much the entire,
[09:00.160 --> 09:02.480]  like probably starting around the late 80s,
[09:02.480 --> 09:04.900]  and right up until the Steve Jobs,
[09:04.900 --> 09:07.500]  Johnny Ive iMac.
[09:07.500 --> 09:10.160]  Like until that iMac keyboard, yeah, I think so.
[09:10.160 --> 09:13.040]  Where all of Apple's keyboards used,
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.240]  I actually forget the exact thickness and weight,
[09:16.240 --> 09:18.080]  but it's a universe condensed,
[09:18.080 --> 09:20.200]  a version of universe condensed slanted,
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.360]  or I forget if they call it italic or slanted,
[09:22.360 --> 09:25.920]  but the font universe, very distinctive,
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.200]  and it does look beautiful.
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.320]  So he made a custom keyboard layout.
[09:32.320 --> 09:34.760]  I think he took somebody else's and then tweaked it,
[09:34.760 --> 09:37.400]  and got a keyboard that truly does look,
[09:37.400 --> 09:38.320]  I mean, that's remarkable.
[09:38.320 --> 09:40.760]  I mean, the colors are a little,
[09:40.760 --> 09:42.080]  probably not what Apple would use,
[09:42.080 --> 09:44.800]  but in many ways it looks like a modern version
[09:44.800 --> 09:46.400]  of an Apple Extended Keyboard 2.
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.240]  Yeah, he did a good job.
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.000]  WASD lets you use Illustrator,
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.360]  there's also like a free open source app
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.520]  that you can download that lets you set
[09:55.520 --> 09:56.600]  these template files up.
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.400]  And so you can put in kind of any font
[09:59.400 --> 10:00.800]  and any symbol you want.
[10:00.800 --> 10:03.760]  And if you're a Mac user, you kind of,
[10:03.760 --> 10:04.600]  they've got some,
[10:04.600 --> 10:06.880]  they've got like a pre-formatted Apple layout,
[10:06.880 --> 10:07.720]  but it's not great.
[10:07.720 --> 10:08.980]  That's one of the things that's prevented me
[10:08.980 --> 10:11.800]  from buying from them is that I'm concerned
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.560]  that if I'm gonna use their service of customizing keys,
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.880]  I want it to be right.
[10:17.880 --> 10:19.300]  And then I start to dive in and I'm like,
[10:19.300 --> 10:21.920]  no, no, no, no, no, this is gonna be a whole project
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.920]  like Steve Trout and Smith found out.
[10:23.920 --> 10:26.040]  It's a whole serious project.
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.880]  Even if you search the web and find somebody
[10:27.880 --> 10:30.880]  who's done a particular layout that you can use
[10:30.880 --> 10:33.680]  and then adapt, but it looks great.
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.060]  I wish WASD let you choose the body of the keyboard,
[10:38.060 --> 10:39.360]  but all their keyboards are black.
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.960]  And I think by default with black keys.
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.960]  And so Steve's keyboard is black body with gray keys,
[10:45.960 --> 10:49.360]  which is not ideal, but it looks great.
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.360]  And the layout looks great.
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.520]  And it definitely, I'm not sure I would do custom key caps
[10:53.520 --> 10:55.600]  hearkening back to this era.
[10:55.600 --> 10:57.280]  I might do something a little more modern,
[10:57.280 --> 11:00.680]  but still Apple-like, but it is,
[11:00.680 --> 11:03.820]  it can't glance at those keys and not feel like you're
[11:03.820 --> 11:05.960]  in the early nineties.
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.000]  My bit of feedback to him,
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.460]  and I don't even know if WASD lets you do it,
[11:08.460 --> 11:11.340]  but I think you could do it yourself if you,
[11:11.340 --> 11:13.080]  there must be some way you could do it yourself
[11:13.080 --> 11:14.840]  by popping the keys off and on.
[11:14.840 --> 11:18.040]  But one of the changes that Apple made at some point
[11:19.560 --> 11:23.320]  was they changed the little home row alignment nubbins.
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.320]  I don't know what,
[11:24.320 --> 11:26.680]  if there's like a keyboard engineering name for them,
[11:26.680 --> 11:28.920]  but everybody familiar with the modern keyboard
[11:28.920 --> 11:31.040]  thinks of them as the things on the F and J key
[11:31.040 --> 11:33.400]  that your index fingers feel.
[11:33.400 --> 11:36.880]  And it's to help you know that you're on the right row.
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.280]  But back in that era,
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.040]  in the Apple extended keyboard two era, Apple,
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.920]  and I think dating back as long as I can remember as a kid,
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.640]  all the way back through the big clacky, clacky Apple twos,
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.920]  Apple used to put them on the D and K keys
[11:50.920 --> 11:52.180]  for your middle finger.
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.920]  And for me, as somebody who still uses
[11:56.920 --> 11:58.680]  an Apple extended keyboard on my,
[11:58.680 --> 12:01.440]  or keyboard two, to be precise, on my iMac,
[12:01.440 --> 12:03.720]  I have, I actually prefer,
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.360]  I prefer the middle finger rather than the index finger.
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.840]  And so I feel like Travis Smith should have done that.
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.080]  Of course you do, you're from Philly.
[12:11.080 --> 12:12.640]  Of course you prefer the middle finger.
[12:12.640 --> 12:16.080]  But they, WASD lets you customize like everything.
[12:16.080 --> 12:17.280]  Like you can, you can get,
[12:17.280 --> 12:20.280]  you can order a key from them in a particular color.
[12:20.280 --> 12:23.240]  So I'm sure that if he wanted to,
[12:23.240 --> 12:24.360]  or if somebody else wanted to,
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.720]  they could order that nubbin key
[12:26.720 --> 12:28.400]  with the other letter printed on it.
[12:28.400 --> 12:30.080]  And then you just pop them off.
[12:30.080 --> 12:33.280]  I mean, they can sell you a little tool that helps,
[12:33.280 --> 12:35.680]  but you just pop off the key and put on a new key.
[12:35.680 --> 12:40.200]  I did a whole custom key layout thing for my stupid keyboard
[12:40.200 --> 12:41.880]  that I use, the same deal from,
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.040]  and I use WASD's keys because they are the ones that will,
[12:45.040 --> 12:47.060]  they'll print anything on a key.
[12:48.060 --> 12:53.040]  Anyway, great work, great company.
[12:53.040 --> 12:56.720]  I guess I should put a link to WASD WASD keyboards
[12:56.720 --> 12:58.000]  in there too.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.120]  So what company was your keyboard from?
[13:01.140 --> 13:04.400]  Oh, it's called, I got from Josh Chipolsky.
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.120]  He was, he was pointing out these things.
[13:06.120 --> 13:08.640]  It's a Leopold is the name of it.
[13:08.640 --> 13:13.280]  And it's a, yeah, it's tenkeyless or it's maybe a 60%.
[13:13.280 --> 13:14.800]  Basically it doesn't have a function key row
[13:14.800 --> 13:16.440]  and it doesn't have a number pad.
[13:16.440 --> 13:18.640]  And I really love it because it's small.
[13:18.640 --> 13:21.860]  And that means that my track pad is right next to it.
[13:21.860 --> 13:24.880]  But it is weird because it's got a non-standard space bar,
[13:24.880 --> 13:27.740]  which means that I can't like buy key cap sets
[13:27.740 --> 13:29.640]  and swap out the space bar.
[13:29.640 --> 13:32.720]  It just, I would have to like start using like super glue
[13:32.720 --> 13:34.800]  and rubber cement and weird stuff.
[13:34.800 --> 13:36.300]  And I'm never gonna do that.
[13:36.300 --> 13:39.040]  So it is, it's pretty good.
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.260]  And I'm using Cherry MX Brown mechanical switches.
[13:43.260 --> 13:45.920]  The first one I got was blue and they were,
[13:45.920 --> 13:46.760]  it was super clicky
[13:46.760 --> 13:49.440]  and this one's a little more kind of clacky.
[13:49.440 --> 13:51.720]  I know that doesn't make any sense, but it is like,
[13:51.720 --> 13:53.240]  that was clicky and this is clacky
[13:53.240 --> 13:55.120]  and I liked the clacky better.
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.080]  So now I know like, I figured out which switch I liked.
[13:58.080 --> 14:00.340]  So now if I order a WASD keyboard, I'll be like,
[14:00.340 --> 14:01.240]  give me the Cherry Brown
[14:01.240 --> 14:03.400]  because that's the switch that I have that I like.
[14:03.400 --> 14:06.480]  And I wouldn't miss, or I would be okay
[14:06.480 --> 14:08.080]  with getting a function key row back
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.300]  because I've got keyboard shortcuts mapped,
[14:10.300 --> 14:11.600]  but it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
[14:11.600 --> 14:13.120]  I just don't want it to be any wider
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.840]  because the further, the more wide the keyboard is,
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.040]  the further away my pointing device is.
[14:18.040 --> 14:21.520]  And then I'm stretching with my right hand to get to it
[14:21.520 --> 14:23.520]  and it gives me some wrist pain.
[14:23.520 --> 14:25.120]  I'm much more comfortable with everything
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.680]  as close together as possible.
[14:26.680 --> 14:29.760]  Part of it, part of this reminds me of, and I do,
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.800]  and there's a part of me that's a nerd
[14:31.800 --> 14:34.820]  who loves to configure everything.
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.400]  I do love that.
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.560]  I love being able to design everything.
[14:40.560 --> 14:44.160]  Like the Ray-Ban website lets you design
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.280]  your own sunglasses.
[14:46.280 --> 14:51.080]  And so I could pick exactly, the frames that I like,
[14:51.080 --> 14:54.440]  I could get them, I can pick like gold chrome,
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.740]  silver chrome, or brushed chrome.
[14:57.740 --> 15:00.380]  You could pick like which lens color you want
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.860]  for the sunglasses and,
[15:02.860 --> 15:05.020]  because they're like the ones I like are like aviator style,
[15:05.020 --> 15:07.760]  you can even pick what color the bit of plastic
[15:07.760 --> 15:10.040]  that goes behind your ears is.
[15:10.040 --> 15:10.880]  I love that.
[15:10.880 --> 15:13.600]  So, and I really, I feel like I got mine just right.
[15:15.340 --> 15:16.540]  And so I appreciate that,
[15:16.540 --> 15:19.220]  but this choice between like cherry red
[15:19.220 --> 15:21.820]  and cherry brown and et cetera,
[15:21.820 --> 15:24.920]  and the fact that at each one there's like different types,
[15:24.920 --> 15:27.940]  there's like another color that's exactly like
[15:27.940 --> 15:32.220]  one of the other ones, but just has like less,
[15:32.220 --> 15:33.860]  takes less pressure to push,
[15:33.860 --> 15:37.400]  but has like the same exact thing at the bottom.
[15:38.280 --> 15:39.620]  Like the thing at the bottom is the thing
[15:39.620 --> 15:41.500]  that makes them most different from each other.
[15:41.500 --> 15:43.020]  Like the, I forget what the word is,
[15:43.020 --> 15:45.500]  but it's like the way that it actually clicks.
[15:45.500 --> 15:47.100]  But then how much pressure it takes
[15:47.100 --> 15:48.780]  is sort of a secondary choice.
[15:48.780 --> 15:52.380]  And I'm overwhelmed by it because I find,
[15:52.380 --> 15:54.300]  I think I like the cherry red,
[15:54.300 --> 15:57.540]  but maybe cherry brown, I don't know.
[15:57.540 --> 16:00.020]  And so I find that choice paralyzing.
[16:00.020 --> 16:01.300]  And I appreciate the fact
[16:01.300 --> 16:03.300]  that with an Apple extended keyboard too,
[16:03.300 --> 16:05.940]  you just got the ones that Apple liked best.
[16:05.940 --> 16:08.500]  Yeah, yeah, that is, I mean,
[16:08.500 --> 16:09.340]  and if you didn't like it,
[16:09.340 --> 16:10.880]  maybe you get a different keyboard
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.260]  that like the IBM keyboards were totally different.
[16:13.260 --> 16:15.300]  And that's like Rich Siegel loves the IBM keyboard,
[16:15.300 --> 16:17.180]  I believe, and it feels completely different.
[16:17.180 --> 16:19.800]  But back then it was, now it's an enthusiast thing
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.100]  where it's like, we make one keyboard
[16:21.100 --> 16:22.420]  and then you choose the switches.
[16:22.420 --> 16:25.740]  And they're emulating like this brand of keyboard
[16:25.740 --> 16:27.140]  or that brand of keyboard.
[16:27.140 --> 16:29.500]  I bought the tester, actually, after we talked,
[16:29.500 --> 16:33.820]  people pointed out in the last episode that I was on
[16:33.820 --> 16:34.940]  that you can get a little tester,
[16:34.940 --> 16:35.900]  which is like a little block.
[16:35.900 --> 16:39.300]  And I did it and it led me to the cherry brown,
[16:39.300 --> 16:42.780]  which I'm happy about, but it's not the same.
[16:42.780 --> 16:45.220]  Like it's not the same to have a little tester
[16:45.220 --> 16:46.180]  where you're clicking a key,
[16:46.180 --> 16:47.720]  trying to imagine how it's different
[16:47.720 --> 16:48.940]  from the key next to it
[16:48.940 --> 16:51.460]  versus actually like typing on a keyboard.
[16:51.460 --> 16:54.540]  It's not, you know, it's better than nothing,
[16:54.540 --> 16:56.820]  but short of buying six keyboards,
[16:56.820 --> 17:01.020]  which is totally insane, short of doing that,
[17:01.020 --> 17:02.980]  you're never gonna really know for sure.
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.740]  Right, it gives you the tester.
[17:04.740 --> 17:07.140]  The tester is actually a fun little fidget toy.
[17:07.140 --> 17:09.820]  And I know that in the intervening months,
[17:09.820 --> 17:10.980]  since you were last on,
[17:10.980 --> 17:14.520]  fidget toys have become like a phenomenon.
[17:14.520 --> 17:18.340]  It is a very fun little, I like to have it at my desk,
[17:18.340 --> 17:19.780]  but it's exactly right.
[17:19.780 --> 17:21.260]  It's like pressing one key.
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.560]  It can give you a basic sense of,
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.260]  oh no, no, definitely not that one.
[17:26.260 --> 17:29.120]  But when you get to two that are kind of close,
[17:29.120 --> 17:31.460]  there's no way that either one gives you the feeling
[17:31.460 --> 17:33.340]  of what it's like to just write an article
[17:33.340 --> 17:35.660]  using a keyboard full of the exact same switch.
[17:35.660 --> 17:38.840]  And to further compound the decisions you have to make,
[17:38.840 --> 17:42.500]  they also ship two kinds of little like gaskets
[17:42.500 --> 17:45.700]  that you can optionally add to any of these.
[17:45.700 --> 17:49.440]  So there's like four levels of choice.
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.960]  It's which bottom out style do you want?
[17:53.960 --> 17:56.860]  Do you want the lighter touch or harder touch?
[17:56.860 --> 18:01.620]  And do you want no gasket, a red gasket or a blue gasket?
[18:01.620 --> 18:03.820]  And I think the gaskets are sort of like quieters,
[18:03.820 --> 18:05.340]  like dampeners.
[18:05.340 --> 18:06.540]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[18:08.540 --> 18:10.860]  And so that's a choice.
[18:10.860 --> 18:12.720]  The gaskets you can change on your own,
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.760]  but it's a lot, what is it, 110 keys or something like that,
[18:16.760 --> 18:18.380]  or 101 keys on a lot of these layouts.
[18:18.380 --> 18:19.940]  So it's a lot of-
[18:19.940 --> 18:21.420]  It takes a while.
[18:21.420 --> 18:22.940]  You can order them with the gaskets on,
[18:22.940 --> 18:24.140]  but you can also do it yourself.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.620]  And it takes a while.
[18:25.620 --> 18:26.440]  I've done that.
[18:26.440 --> 18:27.280]  It takes a while.
[18:27.280 --> 18:31.900]  No, it shows you the advantage of bringing this
[18:31.900 --> 18:35.020]  to a broader version of the same topic,
[18:35.020 --> 18:36.780]  the advantage of what Apple does,
[18:36.780 --> 18:39.180]  where when you buy an Apple product,
[18:39.180 --> 18:43.700]  you are kind of putting yourself in their hands and saying,
[18:43.700 --> 18:46.540]  I want you to make the right decision for me here.
[18:46.540 --> 18:48.620]  And Apple is not a company that generally says,
[18:48.620 --> 18:51.220]  well, you can get it in these 10 different things, right?
[18:51.220 --> 18:52.420]  They 10 different SKUs.
[18:52.420 --> 18:54.020]  You get it, the one that we think
[18:54.020 --> 18:55.480]  is the one that most people are gonna like,
[18:55.480 --> 18:56.420]  and it's the best one.
[18:56.420 --> 18:58.540]  And that frustrates some people.
[18:58.540 --> 18:59.940]  Going to this keyboard thing,
[18:59.940 --> 19:01.980]  it is the exact opposite of that.
[19:01.980 --> 19:03.980]  It's like you have so much choice
[19:03.980 --> 19:07.060]  and nobody's motivated to say,
[19:07.060 --> 19:08.620]  no, no, no, this is the best one
[19:08.620 --> 19:10.380]  because everybody's got a different opinion
[19:10.380 --> 19:12.040]  and they want to give you all the choice,
[19:12.040 --> 19:13.060]  but you become paralyzed.
[19:13.060 --> 19:14.740]  And this is why I haven't bought one of those
[19:14.740 --> 19:16.260]  WASD keyboards.
[19:16.260 --> 19:17.900]  I have to choose,
[19:17.900 --> 19:21.100]  even now that I've settled on the Switch color,
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.540]  which took me a while,
[19:22.540 --> 19:24.740]  there are all of these other issues.
[19:24.740 --> 19:26.420]  And then there's like the keyboard layout thing
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.260]  on top of that.
[19:27.260 --> 19:28.760]  It's like so much choice.
[19:28.760 --> 19:30.860]  And with Apple, it's like, no, we sell a keyboard.
[19:30.860 --> 19:33.260]  It's this one, like it or lump it,
[19:33.260 --> 19:34.660]  but this is the only one we make.
[19:34.660 --> 19:35.980]  So this is the one you're getting.
[19:35.980 --> 19:38.180]  There is something to that.
[19:38.180 --> 19:40.140]  The closest I can think Apple has come to that
[19:40.140 --> 19:42.620]  would be last year with the iPhone 7.
[19:42.620 --> 19:45.020]  I found it excruciating to decide
[19:45.020 --> 19:48.660]  between the flat black and the jet black, right?
[19:49.660 --> 19:52.540]  Offering two blacks is very on Apple-like.
[19:52.540 --> 19:55.860]  Yeah, it's like they couldn't decide which one.
[19:55.860 --> 19:58.700]  There was an internal struggle about the two.
[19:58.700 --> 20:00.980]  And so they're like, fine, whatever.
[20:00.980 --> 20:03.940]  We'll ship them both and see what happens.
[20:03.940 --> 20:05.100]  I wonder what happened.
[20:06.940 --> 20:07.980]  I'd be interested too.
[20:07.980 --> 20:08.820]  I would be fascinated.
[20:08.820 --> 20:10.780]  And it's the sort of thing that, oh my God, I don't know.
[20:10.780 --> 20:13.460]  I bet so few people within the company really know.
[20:13.460 --> 20:15.220]  I mean, I think like anecdotally,
[20:15.220 --> 20:18.620]  you could talk to like a retail employee
[20:18.620 --> 20:20.900]  and they could say, somebody who sells phones
[20:20.900 --> 20:23.100]  in an Apple store on a daily basis
[20:23.100 --> 20:24.540]  probably might have a good sense
[20:24.540 --> 20:26.620]  of which one is more frequent.
[20:28.660 --> 20:32.140]  But who knows how that lines up worldwide,
[20:32.140 --> 20:34.000]  that there might be regional differences
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.020]  or something like that.
[20:35.020 --> 20:37.880]  But I think you must be exactly right
[20:37.880 --> 20:39.740]  that internally they couldn't decide.
[20:39.740 --> 20:41.540]  And that's the reason why someone
[20:41.540 --> 20:44.820]  whose tastes so largely aligned with Apple's institutionally
[20:44.820 --> 20:46.620]  like me would have found it so hard
[20:46.620 --> 20:48.580]  to decide between the two.
[20:48.580 --> 20:50.700]  I've always thought it's so hard.
[20:50.700 --> 20:52.900]  One of the nice things of being a huge,
[20:52.900 --> 20:54.780]  being a diehard Mac user,
[20:54.780 --> 20:56.740]  and I've always said this is one of my,
[20:59.100 --> 21:01.700]  what I love is Mac OS and using the Mac software.
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.700]  And I would, if I had to choose between
[21:03.700 --> 21:07.340]  like a ThinkPad running Mac OS
[21:07.340 --> 21:11.700]  or a MacBook Pro running Windows or any other system
[21:11.700 --> 21:14.620]  that could run, I would choose the PC hardware
[21:14.620 --> 21:17.700]  running Mac OS without even a moment's hesitation.
[21:17.700 --> 21:20.220]  But before you even finish the question,
[21:20.220 --> 21:22.280]  I would buzz in on my Jeopardy thing
[21:22.280 --> 21:23.580]  and say, give me that one.
[21:25.600 --> 21:28.180]  So I always consider myself so fortunate
[21:28.180 --> 21:31.300]  as somebody who really also does care about the hardware
[21:31.300 --> 21:33.980]  that I'm not like, I don't feel that way about Windows.
[21:33.980 --> 21:36.300]  If I felt that strongly as a pro Windows user,
[21:36.300 --> 21:39.260]  I would find buying a new laptop excruciating.
[21:39.260 --> 21:40.720]  It would take me months.
[21:40.720 --> 21:42.460]  And I could, by the time I made up my decision,
[21:42.460 --> 21:44.820]  they'd probably all be outdated.
[21:44.820 --> 21:46.900]  I would find it so hard to decide
[21:46.900 --> 21:49.060]  because I might have a vague idea
[21:49.060 --> 21:52.620]  that I want something roughly 13 inch diagonal,
[21:52.620 --> 21:54.900]  and I want high-end specs,
[21:56.180 --> 21:58.940]  but you've got so many options
[21:58.940 --> 22:01.020]  that are roughly equivalent to each other.
[22:02.060 --> 22:02.900]  So I-
[22:02.900 --> 22:04.060]  I think this is one of the core reasons
[22:04.060 --> 22:06.660]  why people misunderstand Apple when they write about Apple
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.980]  or even just people who don't use Apple products
[22:08.980 --> 22:12.060]  and misunderstand why people like them is this,
[22:12.060 --> 22:14.220]  which is it's not a-
[22:14.220 --> 22:16.900]  because they'll say, but there are so many other choices.
[22:16.900 --> 22:19.220]  It's like, yeah, but there is something to be said
[22:19.220 --> 22:21.100]  for somebody with good taste, you know,
[22:21.100 --> 22:24.260]  and you are relying on the taste of that entity
[22:24.260 --> 22:26.100]  to make those decisions for you and say,
[22:26.100 --> 22:28.460]  we've looked at it and this is really the one that you want
[22:28.460 --> 22:30.120]  and that's what we're selling you.
[22:30.120 --> 22:32.060]  And, you know, some people, for some people,
[22:32.060 --> 22:33.820]  that's not the way they want to live their life.
[22:33.820 --> 22:36.580]  And that's great, but there's a,
[22:36.580 --> 22:38.140]  there's a just huge amount of power
[22:38.140 --> 22:41.940]  in being able to just sort of say, you have three choices.
[22:41.940 --> 22:43.660]  We made all the other choices for you.
[22:43.660 --> 22:47.140]  Pick these from these three and walk away and that's it.
[22:48.380 --> 22:49.220]  Totally agree.
[22:49.220 --> 22:50.780]  All right, so ends our follow-up section
[22:50.780 --> 22:52.700]  and I'll take this break
[22:52.700 --> 22:54.640]  and I will thank our first friend of the show.
[22:54.640 --> 22:56.740]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.620]  Make your next move and make your next website to it
[22:58.620 --> 22:59.520]  at Squarespace.
[22:59.520 --> 23:04.020]  Listen, Squarespace sponsors this show all the time.
[23:04.020 --> 23:06.620]  They're possible, I think quite probably
[23:06.620 --> 23:11.100]  the most frequent sponsor of the talk show in its history.
[23:11.100 --> 23:12.620]  So you've heard me talk about them before
[23:12.620 --> 23:15.020]  if you've listened to the show on any regular basis.
[23:15.020 --> 23:17.020]  Just file this away in the back of your brain
[23:17.020 --> 23:18.420]  the next time you have a project
[23:18.420 --> 23:20.580]  that you need to create a new website for.
[23:21.420 --> 23:23.260]  Try it at Squarespace first.
[23:23.260 --> 23:26.420]  I'm telling you, I know in the back of my head
[23:26.420 --> 23:28.460]  that I would be, I would think, eh, I don't know,
[23:28.460 --> 23:31.080]  somewhere you'd actually just drag and drop on the website.
[23:31.080 --> 23:33.100]  It's on a webpage itself to make your website.
[23:33.100 --> 23:35.060]  How's that gonna be?
[23:35.060 --> 23:37.020]  I'm telling you right now, there are so many websites
[23:37.020 --> 23:39.680]  that you use on a daily basis that are Squarespace sites
[23:39.680 --> 23:42.620]  and you'd never know it because the design flexibility
[23:42.620 --> 23:46.220]  and the number of options you have is as infinite
[23:46.220 --> 23:49.020]  as if you really were sitting there in BB Edit
[23:49.020 --> 23:51.460]  with a brand new empty HTML document
[23:51.460 --> 23:53.140]  and the world's your oyster.
[23:53.140 --> 23:55.860]  Any and everything you could possibly want to design,
[23:55.860 --> 23:57.180]  you can design.
[23:57.180 --> 24:00.020]  And the thing that would gnaw on the back of my head
[24:00.020 --> 24:01.940]  before I tried it is I would think, ah,
[24:01.940 --> 24:04.700]  I'll bet it's like when you created a blogger site
[24:04.700 --> 24:07.100]  10, 15 years ago and you had like three templates
[24:07.100 --> 24:09.280]  to choose from and everybody's blogger site
[24:09.280 --> 24:10.900]  looked like one of these three things.
[24:10.900 --> 24:12.580]  It's not like that at all.
[24:12.580 --> 24:17.580]  Squarespace sites can be branded right down to the pixel
[24:17.660 --> 24:18.920]  from corner to corner.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.300]  I'm telling you right now that I think I mentioned
[24:21.300 --> 24:22.400]  that the last time I sponsored the show,
[24:22.400 --> 24:24.400]  if you view source on Pixar.com,
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.220]  Pixar.com has the Squarespace stuff in their metadata
[24:28.220 --> 24:29.700]  that they're using Squarespace
[24:29.700 --> 24:31.260]  for at least part of their site.
[24:31.260 --> 24:35.780]  It really is that powerful where you would want to use it
[24:35.780 --> 24:37.220]  with infinite resources.
[24:37.220 --> 24:39.060]  But if you don't have infinite resources,
[24:39.060 --> 24:41.180]  if you're just somebody who's like making a website
[24:41.180 --> 24:44.260]  for a friend, do it with Squarespace
[24:44.260 --> 24:45.660]  and you can turn the whole thing over
[24:45.660 --> 24:47.660]  to your completely non-technical friend
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.860]  and they'll be able to take it from there.
[24:49.860 --> 24:54.860]  It'll get them off your back and you'll be done with it.
[24:54.940 --> 24:57.820]  Really, it's just highly recommended.
[24:57.820 --> 24:59.380]  I'm telling you to check them out the next time
[24:59.380 --> 25:01.980]  you need a website or someone you know needs a website
[25:01.980 --> 25:04.140]  and they come to you for advice.
[25:04.140 --> 25:05.800]  Go check them out.
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.060]  Go to squarespace.com slash Gruber
[25:09.060 --> 25:10.740]  and you use that code Gruber
[25:10.740 --> 25:13.040]  and you get 10% off your first order.
[25:13.040 --> 25:14.940]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[25:14.940 --> 25:16.220]  What do you like better, Jason?
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.540]  You like doing the podcast reads
[25:17.540 --> 25:21.860]  or like being the non-reader?
[25:21.860 --> 25:25.340]  Oh, you know, I can do either one.
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.180]  I'm okay.
[25:26.180 --> 25:28.340]  The one that drives me crazy is when it's a podcast read
[25:28.340 --> 25:30.700]  that I also do because then I like,
[25:30.700 --> 25:32.040]  I can see the text in front of me
[25:32.040 --> 25:34.420]  and those are the ones where I will chuckle
[25:34.420 --> 25:38.780]  as like Marco, let's say, will be reading an ad
[25:38.780 --> 25:41.300]  and I'll notice the ways that he does it better
[25:41.300 --> 25:43.460]  and the ways that I think I do it better
[25:43.460 --> 25:47.780]  and like which things he omits or rewords versus what I do.
[25:47.780 --> 25:49.380]  That's kind of fun when that happens
[25:49.380 --> 25:51.880]  but otherwise I don't really mind since I do both, right?
[25:51.880 --> 25:54.440]  I'm on podcasts like when I do upgrade with Mike,
[25:54.440 --> 25:55.520]  he does most of the spots
[25:55.520 --> 25:57.980]  but I do other podcasts where I read the ad spots
[25:57.980 --> 26:00.140]  and so I'm okay either way.
[26:00.140 --> 26:02.500]  The pressure's off when you don't have to read the spot.
[26:02.500 --> 26:03.800]  That is nice.
[26:05.820 --> 26:07.540]  You and Mike show is exactly what I was thinking
[26:07.540 --> 26:09.360]  because I know Mike does them
[26:09.360 --> 26:12.060]  and I know that on a whole bunch of other ones,
[26:12.060 --> 26:14.940]  you know, of your 20 podcasts that you do them.
[26:14.940 --> 26:16.780]  Yeah, fair.
[26:16.780 --> 26:18.380]  I used to find, I've said this before,
[26:18.380 --> 26:19.660]  I used to find it excruciating
[26:19.660 --> 26:21.660]  when I first started doing the show on my own
[26:21.660 --> 26:22.820]  because I knew I was bad at it
[26:22.820 --> 26:25.820]  and I just, but it's like anything,
[26:25.820 --> 26:28.180]  if you don't work at it, you can get better
[26:28.180 --> 26:29.700]  and I find it's just,
[26:29.700 --> 26:31.940]  it's turned into the most energetic part of the show for me
[26:31.940 --> 26:33.900]  because every time I do one, I just try to get fired up
[26:33.900 --> 26:37.220]  and I think, what can I do to make this interesting?
[26:37.220 --> 26:40.020]  Yeah, I think that's the lesson that I took from it.
[26:40.020 --> 26:42.740]  Back in the early days when I started doing Ed spots,
[26:42.740 --> 26:45.180]  when the incomparable was on five by five
[26:45.180 --> 26:47.260]  and I would listen to the way Dan Benjamin did those spots
[26:47.260 --> 26:51.940]  and I really was legitimately like, oh, I see.
[26:53.260 --> 26:54.340]  You're supposed to bring energy
[26:54.340 --> 26:55.980]  and enthusiasm to these Ed reads.
[26:55.980 --> 26:56.820]  Got it, right?
[26:56.820 --> 26:59.640]  And that was a really good thing to follow
[26:59.640 --> 27:02.500]  and I've tried to get better and improve that
[27:02.500 --> 27:03.940]  and bring that energy to it
[27:03.940 --> 27:06.940]  and you know, it could always be better
[27:06.940 --> 27:08.860]  but it's something that, you know,
[27:08.860 --> 27:12.700]  those of us who came from the side of being a writer,
[27:12.700 --> 27:15.460]  it's, a lot of times you're actually meant
[27:15.460 --> 27:17.660]  to keep some remove from that stuff
[27:17.660 --> 27:19.000]  and so then to read the ad is like,
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.180]  I need to get in a different frame of mind to do this
[27:21.180 --> 27:24.680]  because this is not my usual low key,
[27:24.680 --> 27:27.020]  somewhat cynical kind of frame of mind.
[27:27.020 --> 27:28.740]  I'm reading any ad spot.
[27:28.740 --> 27:31.620]  So I, yeah, I think every now and then
[27:31.620 --> 27:32.820]  Mike hands me one on upgrade
[27:32.820 --> 27:35.660]  just because it's a service that's not available in the UK
[27:35.660 --> 27:38.760]  and I need to talk about it and those are fun to do too.
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.100]  All right, most important issue of the week by far and away
[27:42.100 --> 27:46.420]  is Google announced that Android,
[27:46.420 --> 27:48.320]  whatever version number they're up to,
[27:49.500 --> 27:51.340]  I don't know, I actually don't even know
[27:51.340 --> 27:52.580]  but they're doing the thing with Android
[27:52.580 --> 27:56.940]  where they give each version a candy slash snack name,
[27:56.940 --> 27:59.160]  sort of like, so everybody knows it by the name
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.380]  rather than the number,
[28:02.820 --> 28:05.540]  sort of like Mac OS releases where people know Sierra
[28:05.540 --> 28:08.880]  and Hi Sierra and starts blurring together in your brain
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.260]  whether which one's 12, 10.12 and whatever.
[28:12.260 --> 28:15.780]  Anyway, the new version that's coming out imminently soon
[28:15.780 --> 28:17.460]  is called Android Oreo
[28:17.460 --> 28:22.460]  and I wrote on Tearing Fireball about my love,
[28:22.820 --> 28:24.900]  I took it as an opportunity and I mean this sincerely,
[28:24.900 --> 28:27.540]  I really wasn't, I think people took it as me
[28:27.540 --> 28:30.420]  throwing shade at them but I really wasn't
[28:30.420 --> 28:33.380]  but I liked Oreos growing up
[28:33.380 --> 28:36.220]  but back in college I think even, in the late 90s
[28:36.220 --> 28:39.540]  I discovered Numinos from Paul Newman's snack company
[28:41.460 --> 28:45.360]  and I wrote, they're so much better to me,
[28:45.360 --> 28:49.500]  it's unbelievable and again, I'm quite convinced,
[28:49.500 --> 28:51.020]  I am quite convinced, I would bet money
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.460]  that I could take a Pepsi challenge
[28:52.460 --> 28:54.580]  and taste test a Numinos versus Oreo.
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.340]  They definitely taste different in my opinion
[28:58.340 --> 29:01.260]  and I think that a Numinos tastes more like a real cookie
[29:01.260 --> 29:02.520]  where if you look at the ingredients
[29:02.520 --> 29:04.820]  it's made with just like flour and sugar
[29:04.820 --> 29:07.900]  and stuff like that and there's no high fructose corn syrup
[29:07.900 --> 29:10.340]  and Oreos to me tastes a little bit,
[29:10.340 --> 29:11.500]  especially the aftertaste,
[29:11.500 --> 29:14.200]  it tastes a little bit like you ate some sunscreen.
[29:14.200 --> 29:15.540]  Yeah, a little more engineered.
[29:15.540 --> 29:18.580]  I agree, in my house the great debate currently
[29:18.580 --> 29:21.840]  is that my wife thinks double stuff Oreos
[29:21.840 --> 29:24.580]  are an abomination and my children think
[29:24.580 --> 29:26.940]  the more of that filling, whatever it is
[29:26.940 --> 29:28.680]  and wherever it comes from, the better.
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.180]  I'm kind of on the fence about that,
[29:30.180 --> 29:32.460]  I agree with you about Numinos being good,
[29:32.460 --> 29:37.420]  I actually really fell in love with the ginger-os
[29:37.420 --> 29:40.980]  which are a Numin-o but it's like a ginger cookie instead
[29:40.980 --> 29:43.060]  and they're so good, they're so good.
[29:43.060 --> 29:45.420]  I've had those and they are very good.
[29:45.420 --> 29:46.360]  Yeah.
[29:46.360 --> 29:50.540]  I had, I mean, it's the way the taste buds evolve
[29:50.540 --> 29:52.780]  from childhood through adulthood,
[29:54.940 --> 29:56.660]  you'd enjoy sweeter things,
[29:56.660 --> 29:58.420]  this is the reason why kids love candy,
[29:58.420 --> 30:00.820]  when you're younger your taste buds are geared towards it
[30:00.820 --> 30:04.500]  and it's why kids typically don't drink black coffee
[30:04.500 --> 30:08.980]  is bitter things don't taste as well
[30:08.980 --> 30:10.140]  when you're a little kid.
[30:10.140 --> 30:13.460]  When I was a teenager, like late junior high,
[30:13.460 --> 30:16.620]  man, I probably ate half my weight in candy every day
[30:16.620 --> 30:19.940]  and just like the Willy Wonka Gobstoppers and,
[30:19.940 --> 30:22.460]  oh man, Nerds, remember Nerds?
[30:22.460 --> 30:23.300]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[30:23.300 --> 30:27.300]  Oh man, that's just super concentrated sugar.
[30:27.300 --> 30:28.760]  I don't know what the hell is Nerds
[30:28.760 --> 30:33.460]  but it's just like a lemon lime flavored sugar.
[30:33.460 --> 30:34.300]  I love that stuff.
[30:34.300 --> 30:37.280]  So back then I did love Double Stuf Oreos
[30:37.280 --> 30:39.580]  because it was just more of the sweet stuff.
[30:40.540 --> 30:42.460]  I would tend to agree with your wife now though
[30:42.460 --> 30:44.780]  that it's sort of an abomination.
[30:44.780 --> 30:47.460]  It's way out of way, it's definitely out of whack.
[30:47.460 --> 30:50.500]  Yeah, I get why kids liked it, right?
[30:50.500 --> 30:54.580]  That makes sense but yeah, you wanna keep it in balance
[30:54.580 --> 30:56.700]  but yeah, as an adult, your palette is totally different.
[30:56.700 --> 30:59.100]  Whenever Halloween comes around, we have that same thing
[30:59.100 --> 31:01.740]  where I have like one or two of those candies
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.660]  and it's sort of like, wow, that is so much sugar
[31:04.660 --> 31:08.980]  but my kids are happy to just keep on eating that sugar
[31:08.980 --> 31:10.420]  so it works for them.
[31:10.420 --> 31:12.540]  You should try one of those sour candies
[31:12.540 --> 31:13.380]  or something like that and it's like,
[31:13.380 --> 31:15.780]  holy shit, I'm not gonna taste anything for a week.
[31:15.780 --> 31:18.660]  And meanwhile, my son is popping them one after another.
[31:19.820 --> 31:22.680]  No, my tongue starts to hurt after a couple of those candies
[31:22.680 --> 31:26.980]  where it's just like, it's not, no, no, it's not gonna work.
[31:26.980 --> 31:28.980]  But anyway, I bring it up
[31:28.980 --> 31:31.060]  because I really do mean this sincerely
[31:31.060 --> 31:32.980]  and I know exactly what you're, if you're out there
[31:32.980 --> 31:37.980]  and you hear alternate Oreo and you think, ah, they suck.
[31:38.140 --> 31:40.140]  Like the Hydrox, I always thought Hydrox
[31:40.140 --> 31:41.380]  were terrible growing up.
[31:41.380 --> 31:43.220]  I forget there was a brand,
[31:43.220 --> 31:44.700]  I think it might've been regional
[31:44.700 --> 31:46.700]  to Southeastern Pennsylvania.
[31:46.700 --> 31:48.860]  Lance, I think was the name of the company.
[31:48.860 --> 31:53.300]  And like our high school sold these cookies.
[31:53.300 --> 31:55.580]  They were Oreo, exactly like Oreos,
[31:56.460 --> 32:00.500]  black cookies sandwiching a layer of white sugar cream
[32:00.500 --> 32:02.940]  or whatever that stuff is and they were awful.
[32:02.940 --> 32:05.380]  I mean, they just tasted like the Oreos you'd get in prison
[32:05.380 --> 32:06.220]  or something like that
[32:06.220 --> 32:08.840]  or the ones they had in the Soviet Union.
[32:08.840 --> 32:10.740]  I mean, they just tasted like cardboard.
[32:12.080 --> 32:15.580]  And so I know if you have like a bias in your head
[32:15.580 --> 32:17.940]  that anything like an Oreo but that's not an Oreo,
[32:17.940 --> 32:19.460]  is terrible.
[32:19.460 --> 32:22.220]  I implore you to buy one package of Numinos.
[32:22.220 --> 32:26.100]  I find them at like Whole Foods or somewhere like that
[32:26.100 --> 32:28.100]  or I'm sure you can get them on Amazon.
[32:29.060 --> 32:30.900]  Just try one thing of Numinos.
[32:30.900 --> 32:33.260]  I'm telling you, the whole Newman product line
[32:33.260 --> 32:34.080]  is actually great.
[32:34.080 --> 32:35.680]  I think they make good pretzels.
[32:35.680 --> 32:38.540]  It's really high quality stuff.
[32:38.540 --> 32:43.540]  It really is like a better quality Oreo.
[32:43.540 --> 32:48.540]  I read a story about the whole Newman's own business
[32:51.220 --> 32:53.180]  and I believe the way that a lot of this works
[32:53.180 --> 32:55.980]  is because they sell in lower volume for higher prices.
[32:55.980 --> 33:00.420]  What they kind of let the food manufacturing,
[33:00.420 --> 33:02.500]  they subcontract out all the food manufacturing, right?
[33:02.500 --> 33:03.820]  It's just like Trader Joe's does
[33:03.820 --> 33:05.700]  and your local grocery store does
[33:05.700 --> 33:08.420]  but it lets them set their standards
[33:08.420 --> 33:09.580]  a little bit differently.
[33:09.580 --> 33:11.780]  And so you get something where as an Oreo
[33:11.780 --> 33:16.040]  may be just engineered to have a certain amount of flavor
[33:16.040 --> 33:18.300]  to make the kids happy and also costs
[33:18.300 --> 33:20.300]  so that they've got their profit margins
[33:20.300 --> 33:21.820]  where they want them.
[33:21.820 --> 33:24.640]  The Newman's label, it's a little bit different
[33:24.640 --> 33:27.940]  and that's because it doesn't get sold
[33:27.940 --> 33:30.620]  in every single store in mass quantities.
[33:30.620 --> 33:33.640]  And it actually reminded me of our argument
[33:33.640 --> 33:35.680]  about like the high-end iPhone, the same thing
[33:35.680 --> 33:38.380]  where it's like, Apple sells so many iPhones now
[33:38.380 --> 33:41.040]  that to a certain point, they need any feature,
[33:41.040 --> 33:42.940]  any piece of electronics they put in an iPhone,
[33:42.940 --> 33:44.260]  they need to mass produce
[33:44.260 --> 33:48.260]  because they sell tens of millions of iPhones in a year.
[33:48.260 --> 33:50.480]  And that's kind of like an Oreo.
[33:50.480 --> 33:52.920]  And the Newman's are like,
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.020]  I'm not gonna say it's like Andy Rubin's essential phone
[33:55.020 --> 33:55.860]  but it's a little like that.
[33:55.860 --> 33:56.820]  It's like lower volume.
[33:56.820 --> 33:58.340]  They can afford to be different
[33:58.340 --> 34:01.420]  and charge a different price and not have to worry about it.
[34:01.420 --> 34:02.940]  And I think that's the clever thing.
[34:02.940 --> 34:05.620]  It may even in fact even be made in the same factory
[34:05.620 --> 34:06.820]  where they make Oreos.
[34:06.820 --> 34:08.420]  I don't know, they don't say, right?
[34:08.420 --> 34:09.980]  They can't tell you that.
[34:09.980 --> 34:13.460]  But with a different mixture of ingredients
[34:13.460 --> 34:15.460]  that lets them have a different product.
[34:18.100 --> 34:20.980]  Have you ever seen that there's a website
[34:20.980 --> 34:23.960]  that is devoted to backwards engineering
[34:23.960 --> 34:26.580]  where Trader Joe's stuff actually is from?
[34:26.580 --> 34:27.620]  Trader Joe's stuff.
[34:27.620 --> 34:29.400]  Trader Joe's, I think some of their stuff
[34:29.400 --> 34:30.300]  is exactly what you're saying
[34:30.300 --> 34:31.960]  where they just contract somebody to make it.
[34:31.960 --> 34:36.660]  But a lot of their stuff is just rebadged identical stuff.
[34:36.660 --> 34:40.980]  And so for example, the one that is the most painfully
[34:40.980 --> 34:44.580]  obvious is their crinkle cut salt and pepper chips
[34:44.580 --> 34:47.140]  which are excellent, excellent potato chips
[34:47.140 --> 34:51.260]  are clearly kettle brand salt and pepper crinkle cut chips.
[34:51.260 --> 34:52.300]  Exactly the same.
[34:52.300 --> 34:55.480]  There are, it's sort of a very distinctive chip.
[34:55.480 --> 34:56.580]  It's super thick.
[34:56.580 --> 34:59.740]  It's kind of greasy, but really, really good.
[34:59.740 --> 35:01.580]  And it is literally exactly the same.
[35:01.580 --> 35:04.180]  And they used to sell kettle chips right there in the store.
[35:04.180 --> 35:07.700]  And there's a whole website.
[35:07.700 --> 35:09.140]  There's a website though that's devoted
[35:09.140 --> 35:10.980]  to sort of backwards engineering
[35:10.980 --> 35:13.740]  exactly what everything in Trader Joe's actually is.
[35:15.700 --> 35:17.500]  Yeah, cause it comes from all over the place, but it's good.
[35:17.500 --> 35:18.340]  It's mostly good.
[35:18.340 --> 35:19.620]  We go to Trader Joe's all the time
[35:19.620 --> 35:20.800]  because there's good stuff.
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.300]  You learn over time, which ones are the good ones
[35:23.300 --> 35:24.380]  and which ones are the bad ones.
[35:24.380 --> 35:25.420]  I like Trader Joe's a lot.
[35:25.420 --> 35:27.380]  We do, we have one pretty nearby
[35:27.380 --> 35:29.300]  and I feel like I don't go there enough.
[35:29.300 --> 35:31.140]  Every time I go there, I think I should come here more often
[35:31.140 --> 35:32.840]  cause I actually enjoy going there.
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.280]  And just by coincidence, it's like their free samples
[35:36.280 --> 35:38.460]  way more often appeal to me.
[35:38.460 --> 35:41.020]  And I guess I would like to try a little bit of that
[35:41.020 --> 35:41.860]  than most stores.
[35:41.860 --> 35:43.640]  Most stores, it always seems to me like they're offering you
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.640]  some pretty weird stuff on the free samples.
[35:49.020 --> 35:53.240]  We went into a Walmart on this road trip we took
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.040]  and for, I guess, good reason,
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.160]  but we don't have Walmart around here
[35:59.160 --> 36:00.200]  anywhere near where we live.
[36:00.200 --> 36:03.320]  It's, I don't know, 30 miles away or something
[36:03.320 --> 36:04.160]  there's a Walmart.
[36:04.160 --> 36:05.360]  And I'd never even been to one
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.160]  until I was visiting my mom in Arizona.
[36:08.160 --> 36:11.600]  And that's like one of the few places they can go
[36:11.600 --> 36:13.880]  where they're out in the desert there to shop.
[36:13.880 --> 36:16.480]  And so we go to one on this road trip
[36:16.480 --> 36:18.600]  and it was kind of a nightmare.
[36:18.600 --> 36:20.760]  We're looking for groceries, we're looking for snacks,
[36:20.760 --> 36:21.680]  we're looking for stuff.
[36:21.680 --> 36:23.600]  And it was a little bit like
[36:23.600 --> 36:25.400]  sort of like the opposite of Trader Joe's.
[36:25.400 --> 36:29.560]  Like they only had the most marketed
[36:29.560 --> 36:32.960]  and mass available products.
[36:32.960 --> 36:36.460]  And so we're like looking for a very particular cut.
[36:36.460 --> 36:37.920]  We're looking for like Sun Chips
[36:37.920 --> 36:39.800]  and this Walmart was like, nope,
[36:39.800 --> 36:40.640]  you don't have those here.
[36:40.640 --> 36:41.840]  It's like, what are you?
[36:41.840 --> 36:43.440]  Because they've got, it's like Walmart.
[36:43.440 --> 36:47.220]  They only had like Walmart brand and some Doritos.
[36:47.220 --> 36:48.800]  And it was weird, a huge rack,
[36:48.800 --> 36:50.360]  but the brands were all over the place.
[36:50.360 --> 36:51.640]  And I kept thinking,
[36:51.640 --> 36:53.520]  this is what I always read about about Walmart,
[36:53.520 --> 36:54.800]  which is that they have,
[36:54.800 --> 36:57.880]  they're ruthless when it comes to what products they stock
[36:57.880 --> 36:59.240]  and what suppliers they use.
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.800]  And just walking into this one Walmart in Utah,
[37:03.800 --> 37:05.260]  it definitely, I could tell,
[37:05.260 --> 37:07.520]  like there was some stuff that was there
[37:07.520 --> 37:08.760]  and the other stuff's like, nope,
[37:08.760 --> 37:10.280]  we decided not to carry that.
[37:10.280 --> 37:13.320]  And Walmart is powerful enough to just decree that stuff.
[37:13.320 --> 37:14.700]  It was weird.
[37:14.700 --> 37:16.000]  Yeah, it's a weird store.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.540]  Retail is fascinating.
[37:17.540 --> 37:19.640]  All right, the actual biggest topic,
[37:19.640 --> 37:21.520]  or I don't know if we're gonna spend a lot of time on it,
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.640]  but the big thing,
[37:23.640 --> 37:24.880]  and the reason I specifically,
[37:24.880 --> 37:26.720]  why I thought of asking you to be on this show
[37:26.720 --> 37:30.600]  is that last week I commemorated the 15th anniversary
[37:30.600 --> 37:31.840]  of Daring Fireball,
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.680]  of which I consider this podcast to be a part.
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.400]  And I, oh my God, did I get email after that
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.240]  from so many readers.
[37:40.240 --> 37:41.120]  I lost count.
[37:41.120 --> 37:42.520]  And I thank all of you for sending it.
[37:42.520 --> 37:45.680]  I read every single one of them and replied to like two,
[37:45.680 --> 37:48.680]  because if I replied to them all,
[37:48.680 --> 37:50.120]  I wouldn't even have time to do the show.
[37:50.120 --> 37:51.000]  But I thank you.
[37:52.800 --> 37:55.440]  And I really, I have to say, I don't know,
[37:55.440 --> 37:57.400]  you might've noticed, because you're a close reader,
[37:57.400 --> 37:59.320]  but like when Daring Fireball turned 10,
[37:59.320 --> 38:01.240]  I didn't say anything and I didn't do five.
[38:01.240 --> 38:03.920]  This is the first time I've ever mentioned an anniversary.
[38:03.920 --> 38:05.240]  And I certainly don't do it every year,
[38:05.240 --> 38:06.840]  but I didn't do it at 10 either.
[38:08.960 --> 38:11.280]  And my thinking changed between 10 and 15,
[38:11.280 --> 38:14.360]  where 10, I just like, for example, the other thing too,
[38:14.360 --> 38:16.460]  is to the best of my knowledge,
[38:16.460 --> 38:19.740]  Daring Fireball has never won a single award.
[38:19.740 --> 38:22.280]  And I just don't, I don't like that.
[38:22.280 --> 38:24.860]  I just, this is antithetical to me.
[38:24.860 --> 38:25.780]  I don't like it.
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.200]  And to me, celebrating like anniversaries feels like,
[38:31.200 --> 38:34.160]  I don't know, like awarding myself an award or something.
[38:34.160 --> 38:36.600]  There's a part of my nature that is,
[38:36.600 --> 38:39.800]  that finds self-congratulatory stuff to be,
[38:42.400 --> 38:44.720]  I don't know, I don't like it.
[38:44.720 --> 38:47.040]  Yeah, but I think it's good.
[38:47.040 --> 38:48.880]  I think it's healthy to be a little uncomfortable
[38:48.880 --> 38:51.320]  about celebrating your own accomplishments
[38:51.320 --> 38:52.560]  and letting other people do it.
[38:52.560 --> 38:54.400]  But this year I thought, you know what,
[38:54.400 --> 38:56.540]  I'll bet readers would be happy to know.
[38:56.540 --> 38:58.900]  And so why the fuck not?
[39:01.060 --> 39:03.200]  So I wrote about it, but then I thought, you know,
[39:03.200 --> 39:05.480]  and it was actually from my friend, Jim Coodall,
[39:05.480 --> 39:06.960]  who I don't even think it was this year.
[39:06.960 --> 39:08.760]  I think it was like last year,
[39:08.760 --> 39:13.680]  but Jim and I were hanging out somewhere.
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.120]  It was probably in Vegas and just idly,
[39:17.120 --> 39:20.440]  and this is the type of thing that like occurs to Jim,
[39:20.440 --> 39:23.080]  is he just said, do you ever just like do like a word count
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.800]  and figure out how many words you've written
[39:24.800 --> 39:26.460]  on Daring Fireball?
[39:26.460 --> 39:27.500]  And I said, no.
[39:28.600 --> 39:29.560]  And he said, you should do that
[39:29.560 --> 39:31.160]  because I'll bet that's an amazing number.
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.160]  And so as an excuse to actually point out the fact
[39:36.840 --> 39:39.040]  that Daring Fireball had turned 14, I did it.
[39:40.920 --> 39:43.480]  And I counted separately my original words
[39:44.960 --> 39:47.840]  and separately words that are block quotes.
[39:47.840 --> 39:49.920]  In other words, things from other people's articles
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.320]  that I quote, which anybody who reads Daring Fireball
[39:52.320 --> 39:53.320]  knows exactly what I'm talking about.
[39:53.320 --> 39:55.080]  I block quote things all the time.
[39:56.300 --> 39:57.620]  What was the full tally here?
[39:57.620 --> 40:01.000]  So combined between my full articles and link list entries,
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.040]  I've written 2 million.
[40:03.040 --> 40:05.600]  And it's just so funny that it's this close to being over.
[40:05.600 --> 40:08.080]  It's 2 million, as of last Friday,
[40:08.080 --> 40:12.280]  2 million, 1,516 original words
[40:12.280 --> 40:15.760]  and 3 million, 100,000 and change total words,
[40:15.760 --> 40:18.240]  including block quotes, which is a lot of words.
[40:18.240 --> 40:20.840]  And that your full columns is just over a million,
[40:20.840 --> 40:24.080]  the whole piece is at 1,048,000.
[40:24.080 --> 40:27.280]  I did the math on this because those are amazing numbers.
[40:27.280 --> 40:28.600]  And then I was like, okay, what does that mean?
[40:28.600 --> 40:30.880]  What's the average Daring Fireball week?
[40:30.880 --> 40:33.400]  And I looked it up and it's like 2,500 words a week,
[40:33.400 --> 40:36.400]  every week for 15 years gives you your combined total.
[40:36.400 --> 40:41.400]  And of that about 1,300, 1,400 is full column.
[40:41.540 --> 40:44.120]  So that may be one or two kind of column length pieces
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.560]  a week, it's really one big column,
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.560]  but probably over time it was two or three shorter pieces
[40:51.720 --> 40:52.640]  more often than not.
[40:52.640 --> 40:55.120]  And then you throw in an extra thousand words
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.180]  of link list commentary and that's your average week.
[40:58.180 --> 41:02.560]  It's not, it is a huge accomplishment on one level.
[41:02.560 --> 41:04.820]  And on another level, it shows you that it's really,
[41:04.820 --> 41:09.820]  the accomplishment is being consistent at doing a good job,
[41:10.600 --> 41:13.560]  not an unreasonable, like writing 2,500 words a week,
[41:13.560 --> 41:14.760]  it's not unreasonable at all,
[41:14.760 --> 41:16.960]  but to do it every week for 15 years
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.220]  is not something that most people do.
[41:20.220 --> 41:24.920]  No, it's a tribute mostly to just keeping,
[41:24.920 --> 41:27.320]  just keep putting one foot in front of another
[41:27.320 --> 41:32.040]  and then do it for 15 years and you can go a far distance.
[41:32.040 --> 41:33.520]  Yeah, that's totally it.
[41:33.520 --> 41:36.080]  I seem to recall reading years ago
[41:36.080 --> 41:38.840]  that a New York Times op-ed columnist,
[41:38.840 --> 41:40.040]  like their regular columnists,
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.880]  like Paul Krugman and Maurice Doud,
[41:43.880 --> 41:48.880]  their columns are either 700 or 750 words more or less.
[41:49.520 --> 41:51.200]  And there's a little bit of play
[41:51.200 --> 41:54.120]  that they can do layout-wise with a block quote
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.880]  or something to stretch or to expand,
[41:56.880 --> 41:59.200]  but roughly 700, 750 words.
[41:59.200 --> 42:00.280]  And I think that they all,
[42:00.280 --> 42:01.880]  I think most of them do two a week.
[42:01.880 --> 42:03.020]  So that's about the same.
[42:03.020 --> 42:07.320]  It's roughly 1300, 1400 words of regular columns a week
[42:07.320 --> 42:10.760]  is roughly the output of being like an op-ed columnist,
[42:10.760 --> 42:12.640]  which feels like it's about right.
[42:12.640 --> 42:16.440]  My one-pager in Macworld all those years
[42:16.440 --> 42:19.520]  was about 800 words, 780, 760,
[42:19.520 --> 42:21.960]  but I always shot for 800.
[42:21.960 --> 42:25.740]  And I remember thinking David Pogue,
[42:25.740 --> 42:28.440]  back when he did the back page column in Macworld,
[42:28.440 --> 42:29.680]  he would write eight,
[42:29.680 --> 42:32.680]  sometimes we would jump him to a column in the back,
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.360]  but so like 800 backward, which was terrible,
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.240]  it's like between 800 and a thousand words.
[42:38.240 --> 42:39.520]  And he did that 12 times a year.
[42:39.520 --> 42:42.560]  And I remember marveling at that and thinking, wow,
[42:42.560 --> 42:46.120]  how does he come up with 12 column ideas every year?
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.120]  And today I write 800 words a week for Macworld
[42:51.460 --> 42:53.000]  and then I write six color stuff
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.460]  and it's like 52 column ideas a year.
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.840]  How is that even possible?
[42:57.840 --> 42:59.200]  But you find a way.
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.320]  But that does seem like a natural, like 800 words.
[43:01.320 --> 43:02.960]  I think that's what I shoot
[43:02.960 --> 43:05.080]  with my Macworld columns now too, even today.
[43:05.080 --> 43:05.980]  It's like, that's not bad.
[43:05.980 --> 43:10.080]  That's like a thought, a pretty clear supported thought.
[43:10.080 --> 43:11.560]  And then you're out.
[43:11.560 --> 43:12.840]  I feel like I'm so lucky
[43:12.840 --> 43:15.460]  that I've spent my entire writing career.
[43:15.460 --> 43:19.440]  Well, I used to write print in college for print newspaper
[43:19.440 --> 43:22.440]  and that was sort of constrained to the sort of,
[43:22.440 --> 43:24.640]  couldn't go too long, couldn't be too short.
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.000]  And so I have done it both ways, I guess I should say.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.340]  And I've written for the back page of Macworld
[43:31.340 --> 43:33.480]  and had that sort of,
[43:33.480 --> 43:35.040]  and again, there was always a little bit of play.
[43:35.040 --> 43:36.200]  It wasn't that precise.
[43:36.200 --> 43:37.260]  There was a little bit,
[43:37.260 --> 43:38.740]  some kind of a pull quote or something
[43:38.740 --> 43:41.640]  and you could stretch it or shrink it a little bit.
[43:43.320 --> 43:46.400]  But the basic minimum and maximum were pretty narrow
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.240]  and it's harder.
[43:47.240 --> 43:48.280]  It's absolutely harder.
[43:48.280 --> 43:50.240]  So I do marvel at like a Paul Krugman
[43:50.240 --> 43:55.160]  who two times a week, 48 weeks a year at least,
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.320]  hits this exact narrow timeframe
[43:57.320 --> 43:58.520]  because so much of what I write
[43:58.520 --> 44:01.660]  is either way longer than that or way shorter.
[44:01.660 --> 44:06.660]  And I love not having to stretch a smaller idea
[44:06.660 --> 44:10.740]  into bigger, I always hated it.
[44:10.740 --> 44:14.540]  And even worse, I always hated having good sentences
[44:14.540 --> 44:17.540]  cut out of a long piece just because it wouldn't fit.
[44:17.540 --> 44:20.380]  Like that seems crazy in hindsight now.
[44:20.380 --> 44:21.740]  First thing I ever did as an editor,
[44:21.740 --> 44:26.740]  my first day on the job at Mac user back in 94,
[44:26.740 --> 44:28.500]  something like that was,
[44:28.500 --> 44:30.820]  oh, the regular letters column editor is out
[44:30.820 --> 44:31.660]  and she's your boss.
[44:31.660 --> 44:35.280]  So you need to cut this, it's 70 lines over.
[44:35.280 --> 44:37.660]  And literally I had to print out of the letter section
[44:37.660 --> 44:40.380]  of Mac user and had to sit there with a pencil
[44:40.380 --> 44:45.060]  lining out like words to pull up a line or sentences.
[44:45.060 --> 44:46.620]  And that was in print.
[44:46.620 --> 44:48.220]  I mean, that is still how it's done
[44:48.220 --> 44:49.680]  for those who are still doing print.
[44:49.680 --> 44:51.300]  And yeah, it can be brutal.
[44:51.300 --> 44:53.620]  It can also be kind of a great lesson
[44:53.620 --> 44:56.060]  like those pieces you wrote for Mac world.
[44:56.060 --> 44:58.560]  I think I, most of, when you were writing those,
[44:58.560 --> 45:00.080]  I think I was probably the editor on those.
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.500]  And it was very much like that of like,
[45:02.500 --> 45:05.620]  can I change one word to be a little bit shorter here?
[45:05.620 --> 45:07.400]  And then that'll pull up a line
[45:07.400 --> 45:09.320]  cause you were three lines over or something like that.
[45:09.320 --> 45:12.720]  And the best is when you do that and send the PDF back
[45:12.720 --> 45:14.460]  to the writer, you in this case,
[45:14.460 --> 45:15.940]  and say, can you check this out?
[45:15.940 --> 45:18.020]  And if it doesn't look like anything changed,
[45:18.020 --> 45:19.620]  that's the best.
[45:19.620 --> 45:21.860]  But, you know, cause in the end,
[45:21.860 --> 45:22.700]  you don't wanna change the meaning.
[45:22.700 --> 45:26.820]  You just wanna pull up those widows
[45:26.820 --> 45:28.700]  that are dangling over into another line.
[45:28.700 --> 45:30.020]  You wanna pull three of those up
[45:30.020 --> 45:32.900]  so that you can get it, the whole column on that one,
[45:32.900 --> 45:35.580]  on that one piece of paper, which is, it's a fun constraint,
[45:35.580 --> 45:36.620]  but I agree with you.
[45:36.620 --> 45:39.180]  It is so much better when you know you have one thing to say
[45:39.180 --> 45:41.360]  and it's only gonna be two paragraphs to just say it
[45:41.360 --> 45:44.100]  and move on instead of like, what, how,
[45:44.100 --> 45:46.520]  can I take three things that are each worth 200 words
[45:46.520 --> 45:47.740]  and put them together somehow
[45:47.740 --> 45:49.160]  and make 800 words out of it?
[45:49.160 --> 45:50.780]  Which is, it's no good that way.
[45:50.780 --> 45:53.620]  But if you're working in print, you, you know,
[45:53.620 --> 45:55.220]  everything has to be 800 words long
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.660]  or whatever your constraint is.
[45:56.660 --> 45:57.940]  I think I've told this story before,
[45:57.940 --> 45:58.780]  but I'll tell it again.
[45:58.780 --> 46:01.940]  But my first regular writing for the public
[46:01.940 --> 46:05.580]  was at the student newspaper at Drexel, The Triangle.
[46:05.580 --> 46:07.300]  And I, my sophomore year,
[46:07.300 --> 46:10.940]  I started submitting, you know, op-ed columns,
[46:10.940 --> 46:15.180]  you know, where I tried to do sort of a Dave Barry-ish
[46:15.180 --> 46:20.180]  sort of comical look, tried to be funny in op-ed columns,
[46:21.660 --> 46:23.540]  as opposed to, which I thought was so maddening,
[46:23.540 --> 46:25.140]  as most of the shit on the Drexel,
[46:25.140 --> 46:27.500]  on the Triangle op-ed page was like,
[46:27.500 --> 46:29.060]  people writing, trying to write serious shit
[46:29.060 --> 46:31.820]  about Bill Clinton and stuff like that.
[46:31.820 --> 46:33.100]  And it's like, why the fuck would you want to read that
[46:33.100 --> 46:34.060]  in a student newspaper?
[46:34.060 --> 46:35.380]  It's like, I thought I cracked jokes
[46:35.380 --> 46:38.460]  about the shitty stuff going on at this university.
[46:40.780 --> 46:43.540]  And I also had this thought that,
[46:43.540 --> 46:46.140]  my God, I can do better than these people.
[46:46.140 --> 46:49.660]  And the way you, of course, now this is 93, I guess,
[46:49.660 --> 46:50.660]  when I started, right?
[46:50.660 --> 46:53.040]  Or 92, it would have been 1992.
[46:53.040 --> 46:54.940]  The way you submitted a column is you,
[46:54.940 --> 46:58.620]  I think it had to be in MacWrite format.
[46:58.620 --> 47:00.740]  And then I think later it was either MacWrite
[47:00.740 --> 47:04.180]  or they expanded to MacWrite Clarus.
[47:04.180 --> 47:07.020]  What was the Clarus suite called?
[47:07.020 --> 47:07.900]  Was it Clarus Works?
[47:07.900 --> 47:10.400]  Clarus Works, the Clarus Works word processing suite,
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.060]  which maddeningly was made by the same people as MacWrite,
[47:14.060 --> 47:17.380]  but was a different document format or Microsoft Word.
[47:18.460 --> 47:20.340]  And you'd just bring it in on a floppy disk
[47:20.340 --> 47:22.540]  and they'd put the floppy disk in and copy it over
[47:22.540 --> 47:24.700]  and tell you they'd get back to you, you know,
[47:24.700 --> 47:26.860]  see if it got in.
[47:26.860 --> 47:28.700]  I don't even remember how they got back to me
[47:28.700 --> 47:31.580]  because in 1992, like I had email
[47:31.580 --> 47:33.460]  because I was majoring in computer science,
[47:33.460 --> 47:36.180]  but I don't think school-wide there was email yet
[47:36.180 --> 47:37.480]  or if there was, I don't know.
[47:37.480 --> 47:38.580]  So somehow they got back to me and said,
[47:38.580 --> 47:40.060]  okay, we're running it.
[47:40.060 --> 47:41.380]  And I was very, very proud.
[47:41.380 --> 47:43.660]  And I think like my third column,
[47:43.660 --> 47:47.380]  the third one I submitted when it came out.
[47:47.380 --> 47:49.140]  And then of course I read it, you know,
[47:49.140 --> 47:51.040]  word for every time it would, you know, those early ones,
[47:51.040 --> 47:53.020]  I'd read every single one in print.
[47:53.020 --> 47:55.340]  And it was amazing because there's my writing
[47:55.340 --> 47:58.300]  and my name right there on a real freaking newspaper.
[47:58.300 --> 48:00.320]  And like halfway through,
[48:00.320 --> 48:03.020]  one of my sentences got rewritten
[48:03.020 --> 48:05.220]  and I thought it turned what was previously
[48:05.220 --> 48:07.720]  a very clever, funny sentence into one
[48:07.720 --> 48:10.080]  that wasn't even funny at all.
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.820]  And I was like, what the hell did I,
[48:11.820 --> 48:14.540]  what, you know, did I make a grammatical error?
[48:14.540 --> 48:17.380]  Like if I did, I'd be damned if I knew what it was.
[48:17.380 --> 48:19.700]  And so when I submitted my next one,
[48:19.700 --> 48:21.100]  the guy who was the op-ed editor said,
[48:21.100 --> 48:24.320]  I remember his name, Francis Wisniewski, very nice guy.
[48:25.860 --> 48:28.380]  And I said, I asked him, I said, hey, by the way,
[48:28.380 --> 48:29.680]  this last one I had right here.
[48:29.680 --> 48:32.380]  And I said, I originally wrote whatever the sentence was
[48:32.380 --> 48:33.300]  and you changed it to this.
[48:33.300 --> 48:34.480]  What did I do wrong?
[48:34.480 --> 48:35.680]  And he goes, oh, you didn't do anything wrong.
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.380]  I just needed to move it up a line.
[48:39.020 --> 48:42.260]  Like the column was one line too long.
[48:42.260 --> 48:44.900]  So he edited that sentence to make it shorter enough
[48:44.900 --> 48:48.420]  that the whole column gained one line.
[48:48.420 --> 48:49.780]  And as soon as he said that,
[48:49.780 --> 48:52.080]  I thought I need to become the op-ed editor.
[48:54.260 --> 48:55.100]  And I was like-
[48:56.380 --> 48:58.180]  His failure was that he blew your joke
[48:58.180 --> 49:00.700]  in changing the line count, right?
[49:00.700 --> 49:02.860]  Cause a good editor would keep the joke
[49:02.860 --> 49:04.980]  and find another way to make it work.
[49:04.980 --> 49:09.980]  Right, and Francis, I did not steal his job.
[49:10.540 --> 49:12.380]  He was not, it wasn't like his aspiration.
[49:12.380 --> 49:14.460]  And in fact, I think he really, really wanted to be,
[49:14.460 --> 49:16.300]  was like the business manager.
[49:16.300 --> 49:18.260]  And he went on to do that and do a very good job.
[49:18.260 --> 49:19.500]  So it wasn't like I stole his job.
[49:19.500 --> 49:21.780]  And as you might expect, semester to semester,
[49:21.780 --> 49:24.980]  there's a lot of turnover in a student newspaper.
[49:24.980 --> 49:28.580]  But I literally, I took the job as op-ed editor
[49:28.580 --> 49:31.740]  so that I could, and then taught myself,
[49:31.740 --> 49:34.020]  learned there at the newspaper graphic design
[49:34.020 --> 49:35.560]  and Quirk Express and everything.
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.940]  But I did it specifically so that my columns would,
[49:39.940 --> 49:43.460]  A, never get mangled like that.
[49:43.460 --> 49:45.740]  And then B, ought to be honest,
[49:45.740 --> 49:50.080]  to always give them the best spot on the page.
[49:50.080 --> 49:51.180]  Sure, of course.
[49:51.180 --> 49:53.380]  That's your prerogative, quite frankly.
[49:53.380 --> 49:57.020]  Here we are 20, 20, geez, 20 some years later.
[49:57.020 --> 50:00.500]  And my column still gets the best spot.
[50:01.580 --> 50:03.860]  I'm looking, by the way, at something,
[50:03.860 --> 50:04.960]  if this is 14 years ago,
[50:04.960 --> 50:07.220]  I'm not sure if this is the first thing you wrote for me,
[50:07.220 --> 50:10.380]  but one of the things in the early days of Daring Fireball
[50:10.380 --> 50:12.900]  that I wanted to mention is I have a distinct memory
[50:12.900 --> 50:14.740]  that we had you write some how-to articles
[50:14.740 --> 50:15.900]  about BB Edit.
[50:15.900 --> 50:17.620]  I found one of them that's still on the web
[50:17.620 --> 50:19.060]  about version control in BB Edit.
[50:19.060 --> 50:20.780]  It's 2,000 words, how-to article,
[50:20.780 --> 50:22.260]  but I think you wrote a few.
[50:22.260 --> 50:23.460]  Yes, I do.
[50:23.460 --> 50:26.780]  At least, because I remember you saying to me at some point,
[50:26.780 --> 50:29.900]  it may have been in this 2003 era
[50:29.900 --> 50:32.580]  where we were having you write some freelance stuff for us
[50:32.580 --> 50:34.620]  where you said, I made more money
[50:34.620 --> 50:36.860]  on what I wrote for Macworld last year
[50:36.860 --> 50:38.180]  than I did for Daring Fireball.
[50:38.180 --> 50:40.900]  And literally you wrote like three articles for me.
[50:40.900 --> 50:42.260]  But those were the early days
[50:42.260 --> 50:44.300]  when you were just getting started with Daring Fireball
[50:44.300 --> 50:46.700]  and that was, it was funny
[50:46.700 --> 50:48.220]  because it was really literally like,
[50:48.220 --> 50:50.220]  I saw your work on the web and we're like,
[50:50.220 --> 50:51.540]  oh, there's a guy who can write.
[50:51.540 --> 50:53.300]  I wonder if he could write some stuff for us.
[50:53.300 --> 50:56.180]  And I know you had worked on BB Edit stuff before
[50:56.180 --> 50:57.020]  and so you knew that.
[50:57.020 --> 50:59.620]  And so in those early days,
[50:59.620 --> 51:02.060]  we threw some how-to stuff your way.
[51:02.060 --> 51:03.420]  And then eventually you also,
[51:03.420 --> 51:05.020]  you did those back page columns for a while,
[51:05.020 --> 51:06.220]  including that one.
[51:06.220 --> 51:08.780]  That's got to kill you though, the how Apple rolls thing,
[51:08.780 --> 51:11.140]  like that's like one of the more famous things
[51:11.140 --> 51:12.980]  that people quote all the time
[51:12.980 --> 51:14.860]  and you have to link to it on Macworld every time
[51:14.860 --> 51:15.700]  because it's on.
[51:15.700 --> 51:16.980]  I think you could reprint that.
[51:16.980 --> 51:18.820]  I think you have the rights to reprint that now.
[51:18.820 --> 51:22.180]  I was just going to tell you, I actually had plans.
[51:22.180 --> 51:26.140]  I was just going to reprint it and wait for a life.
[51:26.140 --> 51:27.860]  I think you have the rights.
[51:27.860 --> 51:29.540]  I think the way that the writers contract,
[51:29.540 --> 51:32.780]  there was, we redid our writers contract at some point
[51:32.780 --> 51:37.500]  and it was two freelance editors or freelance writers
[51:37.500 --> 51:39.420]  who really pushed back on some of the details of it,
[51:39.420 --> 51:41.700]  including Bruce Fraser,
[51:41.700 --> 51:44.980]  who was an expert in publishing and pre-press
[51:44.980 --> 51:46.940]  and color and color management.
[51:46.940 --> 51:49.920]  Great guy, passed away a few years ago
[51:49.920 --> 51:53.080]  and he made like 20 changes to the writers contract.
[51:53.080 --> 51:54.920]  But one of the things that came out of that contract
[51:54.920 --> 51:58.700]  was this idea that you get rights back
[51:58.700 --> 52:00.680]  or like they keep the copyright,
[52:00.680 --> 52:03.900]  but you get a permanent sub-license after a period of time.
[52:03.900 --> 52:05.980]  So I think, yeah, I think you could probably republish that
[52:05.980 --> 52:07.860]  and stop linking to the Macworld version
[52:07.860 --> 52:09.900]  and nobody would notice probably.
[52:09.900 --> 52:12.100]  Yeah, I've actually been meaning to do that.
[52:12.100 --> 52:15.220]  And I even thought it even re-popped into my head last week
[52:15.220 --> 52:16.100]  when I did the word count,
[52:16.100 --> 52:18.100]  cause I thought, well, should I count that?
[52:18.100 --> 52:18.920]  And then I thought, well,
[52:18.920 --> 52:20.460]  then I'd have to find all the other ones too.
[52:20.460 --> 52:23.660]  And it seemed like I'd already given myself enough work.
[52:23.660 --> 52:24.860]  So I didn't count them.
[52:25.700 --> 52:28.820]  And you know what, I probably would have done it
[52:28.820 --> 52:31.940]  if instead of being like a thousand words over 2 million,
[52:31.940 --> 52:35.340]  if it had come out like 1,500 words under 2 million,
[52:35.340 --> 52:37.780]  I would have gone there, done it so that I could,
[52:37.780 --> 52:40.540]  because it's like, and nobody,
[52:40.540 --> 52:42.820]  I know nobody was gonna double check my work.
[52:42.820 --> 52:45.260]  So I could have just lied too and pumped it over,
[52:45.260 --> 52:47.660]  but that I wouldn't, I couldn't sleep if I had done that.
[52:47.660 --> 52:49.340]  So I would have somehow figured out a way
[52:49.340 --> 52:53.140]  to add to the word count and that would have been the way.
[52:53.140 --> 52:54.460]  So how'd you do the word count?
[52:54.460 --> 52:56.020]  I have to ask, how'd you do the word count?
[52:56.020 --> 52:59.220]  Did you do like a crazy, like custom movable type template
[52:59.220 --> 53:02.420]  and just export it out and then do some greps,
[53:02.420 --> 53:03.820]  do some regular expression stuff?
[53:03.820 --> 53:04.660]  No, even easier.
[53:04.660 --> 53:08.940]  So in movable type, you can, is it export?
[53:08.940 --> 53:10.140]  I think it's export.
[53:10.140 --> 53:10.980]  They have two features.
[53:10.980 --> 53:13.220]  One is backup, like you backup your blog
[53:13.220 --> 53:14.980]  and it somehow they say, this is a complete bad.
[53:14.980 --> 53:15.820]  I don't know what that is.
[53:15.820 --> 53:17.780]  And I did that and it took forever
[53:17.780 --> 53:20.020]  and I don't even know where they put it.
[53:20.020 --> 53:22.140]  It must be in some directory on my server
[53:22.140 --> 53:24.500]  in the movable type directory, like in a zip.
[53:24.500 --> 53:26.580]  And then I tried the export and I thought,
[53:26.580 --> 53:28.180]  this is probably gonna time out.
[53:29.180 --> 53:31.420]  But the export for my regular articles
[53:31.420 --> 53:34.820]  didn't take too long and it instantly turns it
[53:34.820 --> 53:36.780]  into a download in your browser.
[53:36.780 --> 53:39.180]  So it just downloads a dot text file.
[53:40.220 --> 53:42.940]  The link list one, which has like, what did I say?
[53:42.940 --> 53:45.140]  25,000 entries.
[53:45.140 --> 53:48.060]  It took a while, but it never timed out.
[53:48.060 --> 53:50.660]  I never let my browser go to sleep.
[53:50.660 --> 53:52.540]  And I don't know, at some point,
[53:52.540 --> 53:54.060]  I don't know if it was five, 10,
[53:54.060 --> 53:55.380]  cause I stopped paying attention,
[53:55.380 --> 53:59.020]  but there was a big text file in my downloads folder with,
[53:59.020 --> 54:02.540]  and it's, so one file for each of the two blogs,
[54:02.540 --> 54:05.580]  my one blog and movable type is the full articles
[54:05.580 --> 54:08.500]  and the other one is the link list entries.
[54:08.500 --> 54:10.780]  So I had one file for each and there's,
[54:10.780 --> 54:14.180]  it's sort of an easy to understand format
[54:16.740 --> 54:18.620]  that movable type created for this,
[54:18.620 --> 54:21.500]  where there's like seven dashes to separate articles
[54:21.500 --> 54:25.260]  and five dashes on a line to separate fields.
[54:25.260 --> 54:29.500]  And then, you know, a little bit of grep here and there,
[54:29.500 --> 54:32.700]  just to delete all the other fields.
[54:32.700 --> 54:37.700]  And then I was left with nothing, but just article text.
[54:37.860 --> 54:39.300]  I will add as,
[54:40.300 --> 54:42.100]  because this is the director's commentary
[54:42.100 --> 54:43.540]  of Daring Fireball.
[54:43.540 --> 54:47.100]  I made the decision, the completely arbitrary decision
[54:47.100 --> 54:50.940]  that I would count my headlines as words written
[54:50.940 --> 54:54.900]  for my articles, but not for link list entries,
[54:54.900 --> 54:57.540]  where sometimes I will write something,
[54:57.540 --> 55:00.260]  which I think is clever as a link list entry title,
[55:00.260 --> 55:03.580]  but very often I just take the headline
[55:03.580 --> 55:06.220]  from the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal
[55:06.220 --> 55:08.940]  or gently rewrite the original headline.
[55:08.940 --> 55:13.020]  And it doesn't feel like it's fair to count them as words
[55:13.020 --> 55:13.980]  or as original words,
[55:13.980 --> 55:16.580]  whereas my headlines I do think are.
[55:16.580 --> 55:17.860]  So I deleted all the headlines,
[55:17.860 --> 55:19.540]  the titles for the link list entries,
[55:19.540 --> 55:22.340]  but didn't delete the titles for Daring Fireball.
[55:22.340 --> 55:23.940]  And then I just wrote,
[55:23.940 --> 55:26.100]  I have a Perl script that just went through
[55:26.100 --> 55:30.500]  and counted all the words on lines that started with,
[55:32.740 --> 55:35.500]  right pointing, the greater than sign
[55:37.580 --> 55:41.980]  and counted those as block quotes
[55:41.980 --> 55:44.540]  and counted all other lines as words of text.
[55:46.940 --> 55:49.540]  So the other thing in there where the counts
[55:49.540 --> 55:52.260]  are probably a little bit inexact to tell you the truth
[55:52.260 --> 55:54.380]  is that the first year and a half or so
[55:54.380 --> 55:57.100]  of Daring Fireball entries weren't written in Markdown.
[55:57.100 --> 56:00.100]  They had to, because Markdown didn't exist.
[56:00.100 --> 56:02.860]  And so for those, I think the block quotes
[56:02.860 --> 56:04.900]  actually got counted as original words.
[56:04.900 --> 56:06.100]  So I forget.
[56:07.300 --> 56:09.140]  I think, I don't know.
[56:09.140 --> 56:10.340]  I think it's close enough.
[56:10.340 --> 56:11.180]  Yeah.
[56:12.020 --> 56:14.380]  I did that after my first year doing Six Colors.
[56:14.380 --> 56:15.220]  I did it.
[56:15.220 --> 56:17.940]  And I think I set up like a template
[56:17.940 --> 56:20.900]  that was just body text of things with my byline
[56:20.900 --> 56:22.460]  since Dan and I both read on the site
[56:22.460 --> 56:24.180]  and I did it that way.
[56:24.180 --> 56:26.140]  And it just spat out an HTML file
[56:26.140 --> 56:28.060]  that I could grab a little bit.
[56:28.060 --> 56:29.860]  But it was one file with everything?
[56:30.740 --> 56:31.780]  Yeah.
[56:31.780 --> 56:32.820]  Yeah, it was like an archive,
[56:32.820 --> 56:35.580]  but I just downloaded the same thing here
[56:35.580 --> 56:39.100]  and I can see how that would be a smart way to go.
[56:39.100 --> 56:41.020]  Cause it is just a super simple text file.
[56:41.020 --> 56:42.420]  I had a bunch of people ask me like,
[56:42.420 --> 56:43.940]  how do you think you did the word count?
[56:43.940 --> 56:45.300]  So I thought I would ask.
[56:45.300 --> 56:46.460]  Ah, that's a good question.
[56:46.460 --> 56:47.300]  You know.
[56:47.300 --> 56:49.940]  And then I also, the other thing I did
[56:49.940 --> 56:52.900]  is I documented it in a note to myself in Yojimbo,
[56:52.900 --> 56:56.500]  exactly what I searched and replaced for in the file.
[56:56.500 --> 56:58.500]  So the next time I do it, I can just bring up that doc
[56:58.500 --> 57:01.540]  and I don't have to spend 10 minutes tweaking grep patterns
[57:01.540 --> 57:03.780]  to exactly nuke the parts I don't want.
[57:05.220 --> 57:06.060]  The funny part is-
[57:06.060 --> 57:07.500]  I want to say, go ahead.
[57:07.500 --> 57:09.860]  Well, no, you go first.
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.420]  I won't forget.
[57:11.420 --> 57:12.260]  All right.
[57:12.260 --> 57:16.300]  I just want to say it's a big deal to do anything
[57:16.300 --> 57:18.500]  for five years, let alone 15 years.
[57:18.500 --> 57:21.100]  So to be as consistent as you've been with a site
[57:21.100 --> 57:22.060]  is a big deal.
[57:22.060 --> 57:23.500]  And people don't,
[57:23.500 --> 57:26.060]  I think people don't give consistency enough credit.
[57:27.380 --> 57:30.900]  It is a big deal to write 1500 words
[57:30.900 --> 57:33.100]  or 2,500 words every week for 15 years.
[57:33.100 --> 57:34.220]  It's a huge deal.
[57:34.220 --> 57:36.300]  And you do, because as simple as it seems
[57:36.300 --> 57:38.540]  to put one foot after another,
[57:38.540 --> 57:41.100]  it isn't over time because at some point
[57:41.100 --> 57:42.940]  you want to take a break from that
[57:42.940 --> 57:46.300]  and to keep doing it and persisting is a big deal.
[57:46.300 --> 57:51.300]  I also wanted to say personally that the,
[57:51.540 --> 57:54.180]  and this is a funny thing about the way the web works
[57:54.180 --> 57:55.300]  and the way the media works,
[57:55.300 --> 57:58.060]  but when I got to know you,
[57:58.060 --> 57:59.540]  I was the editor of a magazine
[57:59.540 --> 58:01.740]  with hundreds of thousands of subscribers and whatever,
[58:01.740 --> 58:03.500]  and we gave you some freelance work and all of that.
[58:03.500 --> 58:06.700]  But the fact is, more often than not,
[58:06.700 --> 58:09.340]  Daring Fireball was an inspiration to me
[58:09.340 --> 58:13.180]  about how the way we were writing about technology
[58:13.180 --> 58:14.860]  was changing on the web.
[58:14.860 --> 58:18.700]  And when I was unhappy in my job
[58:18.700 --> 58:20.740]  in the last few years I was at IDG,
[58:20.740 --> 58:24.260]  I have to say one of the things that I thought of was,
[58:24.260 --> 58:25.580]  could I do what John does?
[58:25.580 --> 58:27.140]  Could I try to do that?
[58:27.140 --> 58:30.420]  And nobody's, we're different people
[58:30.420 --> 58:32.340]  and the web is a very different place
[58:32.340 --> 58:34.980]  than it was 10 years ago or 15 years ago.
[58:34.980 --> 58:39.780]  But be that as it may, one of the big things in my mind
[58:39.780 --> 58:41.580]  when I decided to go out on my own
[58:41.580 --> 58:44.060]  rather than try to find a different job
[58:44.060 --> 58:45.780]  in the media or somewhere else,
[58:45.780 --> 58:48.700]  was I'm not gonna forgive myself
[58:48.700 --> 58:50.900]  if I didn't give that a try.
[58:50.900 --> 58:53.140]  And that was because I saw what you had done
[58:53.140 --> 58:54.140]  and I liked it so much.
[58:54.140 --> 58:55.820]  And I thought that is the thing to do.
[58:55.820 --> 58:58.420]  That is the job I would like to have
[58:58.420 --> 58:59.900]  is something like what John does.
[58:59.900 --> 59:02.100]  So as an inspiration to me,
[59:02.100 --> 59:04.940]  not just for all your great work writing about this stuff,
[59:04.940 --> 59:06.780]  but on a personal level,
[59:06.780 --> 59:07.980]  as somebody who I looked at and said,
[59:07.980 --> 59:10.220]  he's doing great stuff
[59:10.220 --> 59:12.060]  and I would love to be somebody
[59:12.060 --> 59:14.780]  who can do something even sort of like that.
[59:14.780 --> 59:16.620]  I wanna thank you.
[59:16.620 --> 59:17.940]  Well, you're very, very welcome.
[59:17.940 --> 59:21.420]  And I'm very, I have to say,
[59:21.420 --> 59:26.420]  proud of the number of sites that are like Six Colors,
[59:26.700 --> 59:28.180]  like Jim's Loop.
[59:31.140 --> 59:32.700]  Max Stories, 512Pixels.
[59:32.700 --> 59:33.540]  I mean, there are a lot of them
[59:33.540 --> 59:35.540]  that it's very clearly you're the inspiration for that.
[59:35.540 --> 59:36.380]  Absolutely.
[59:36.380 --> 59:41.380]  And to me, it is a non-zero sum game.
[59:41.380 --> 59:46.380]  So it's like when other sites started getting more,
[59:46.740 --> 59:48.780]  Daring Fireball-ish sites started appearing,
[59:48.780 --> 59:51.860]  I didn't think, oh, you fucker, you ripped me off.
[59:51.860 --> 59:53.100]  I thought, hey, this is cool.
[59:53.100 --> 59:53.940]  I did.
[59:53.940 --> 59:55.860]  Now, it's the difference between me and somebody,
[59:55.860 --> 59:57.820]  if somebody made a site that looked like Daring Fireball,
[59:57.820 --> 59:59.560]  I'd be angry and I'd say something.
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.660]  Somebody who makes something that follows this format,
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.380]  which is different than what came before
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.540]  and tries to monetize it in similar ways.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.020]  To me, that is like, it's like that makes me proud.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.280]  So I appreciate your kind words about that.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.460]  And it pains me.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.300]  I hate taking compliments, but I'll take this one.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.420]  The other thing that I found
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.620]  in my perusal of these archives,
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.000]  I remembered that I had done this,
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.360]  but this whole thing where I had to sort of parse
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.880]  the ones written in Markdown differently
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.780]  than the ones written in HTML.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.880]  Sometimes I do forget it though.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.220]  Like I know it, but when I look at it, it was weird.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.420]  So I linked to, for the anniversary,
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.020]  I linked to my very first article on Daring Fireball
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:44.700]  and all of the links,
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.860]  every single link in the article was a 404.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.720]  I would guess that over 90% of the links
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.860]  from the first year or two of Daring Fireball are now 404s.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.840]  And so I thought, well, I'll fix them as best I can
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.420]  by painstakingly going to the internet archive
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.660]  and finding an archive version of the same thing
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.500]  and link to it.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.860]  And it worked for all but one.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.940]  And it makes me furious and I'm gonna call them out,
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:07.740]  it was eWEEK, eWEEK is still,
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.860]  there still is an eWEEK website,
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.780]  but eWEEK not only broke their own goddamn URL,
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.020]  but their robots text forbids the internet archive
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.500]  from archiving the article.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.800]  So I can't even point to it there.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.980]  So it's literally lost to time.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.380]  So fuck you eWEEK.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.940]  But everything else, I wanted to fix the links,
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.620]  including a whole bunch of links to apple.com.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.180]  And it was kind of funny finding them
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.060]  and looking at that,
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:34.900]  cause you can link to it
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.980]  and you can see the old apple.com web design from 2002.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.740]  But when I went to fix those links,
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.540]  I opened it up in movable type
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.900]  and I was like, what the fuck is this?
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.260]  Cause it's all these P tags all over the place.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.140]  And I thought it was just a moment.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.740]  It only took me a moment to remember,
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.380]  yes, you had to invent Markdown to not be writing in HTML.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.820]  But there was this brief moment where I really thought that,
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.260]  I thought that it was like an SQL error or something.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.380]  Yeah, like something broke in my browser
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:09.860]  and I was looking at something that I wasn't supposed to see
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.180]  and then I realized, oh yeah,
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.940]  that's how you used to have to do this.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.700]  Anyway though, the thing that I found that I remember is
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.700]  I publicly announced Markdown as a beta in March of 2004.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.020]  But I had been working on it
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.500]  since like September or October of 2003.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:35.300]  And I started writing my articles on Daring Fireball
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.420]  using Markdown months before I announced it.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.340]  And mostly going back and forth with Aaron Swartz,
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.180]  who was my muse for this.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.020]  Like there were a couple of people who when I started,
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.860]  I emailed them and said,
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.140]  here's what I'm thinking about making.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.260]  Would you be interested in like more or less beta testing
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.980]  that's giving me feedback on this?
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.060]  And every, almost every state,
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.220]  literally every person I went to,
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.540]  I forget who else I went to,
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.020]  but almost every other person wished me well
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.460]  and didn't wanna say anything like that's a stupid idea.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.140]  But I think they all have more or less thought
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.740]  that's a stupid idea.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.580]  I'm fine writing in HTML.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.340]  Like I don't have a problem writing in HTML.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.700]  So why in the world would I want to abstract it?
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.980]  Except Aaron, Aaron got it right away.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.780]  Even though he had his own thing, which was called ATX,
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.540]  which was sort of, the exact same idea is Markdown.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.700]  Like, here's like a format you can write in
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.620]  that alleviates you of the tediousness
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.540]  of putting in every single HTML tag by hand
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.180]  and all those, littering your text with it.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.300]  And I even, a liberal, and I said to him,
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.260]  here's the ideas I'm stealing from ATX.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:49.420]  But he got, he instantly got how even before I,
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.100]  my first cut at the Markdown, what it would be,
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.580]  he instantly saw it as superior to anything else
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.300]  that was out there, including ATX and at the time Textile,
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.540]  which was pretty popular.
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.500]  But what would happen is every couple of days
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.340]  I'd do a new build and either,
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.700]  you know, I changed the syntax in subtle ways.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.700]  But I started writing my articles in it well before this.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.140]  And then it's the smartest thing I think I did
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.140]  in the whole thing because so much changed
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.660]  after I actually had to use it.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.900]  You know, like my ideas for how Markdown would be good.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.660]  When the rubber met the road, some of them were bad ideas.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.380]  And then there were things that I just hadn't thought of
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:29.700]  that I was like, like one of them I remember
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.780]  is originally I didn't have any syntax
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.060]  in Markdown for lists.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.940]  I just thought, well, of all the things
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:40.780]  you have to enter in HTML, the OL tags and UL tags
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.760]  for unordered lists is no big deal.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.180]  But then I realized as so many other things
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.500]  go so much easier to write, I was like,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.580]  wouldn't it be great if I could just put an asterisk space
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.180]  and then it would be a bullet item?
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.580]  You know, so it was through actually using it
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.700]  that it happened.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.500]  But that meant though that every time I changed the syntax
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.700]  as the months went on, I had to go back
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.740]  and edit every single article that I'd written
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.660]  for the last two weeks, three weeks.
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.900]  And all by the end, it was like, I'd have to go back,
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.900]  I'd make like a subtle change and I'd have to go back
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.500]  and double check three months of articles
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.560]  and change the syntax so that they wouldn't break.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.940]  So it was kind of a pain in the ass.
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:24.340]  So anyway, I found the first article I ever wrote
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.060]  and published using Markdown.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.660]  It was an article titled Run Panther Run
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.760]  on the 3rd of November, 2003.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.380]  And you can verify this.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.860]  There's a trick on Daring Fireball
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:38.220]  where if you add a dot text extension to any URL,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.580]  you can see the Markdown version of that article.
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:45.260]  And so on the one previous to that article
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.840]  titled Command Tab at the end of October, 2003,
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.700]  it's still written in raw HTML
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.240]  and then the next one's written in Markdown.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.720]  I think I counted.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.280]  You have to do dot T, dot T-E-X-T.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.320]  Yeah, T-E-X-T, because I'm not an animal
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.480]  who's limited by a three character extension.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.040]  So anyway, I think I counted in there
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.680]  by the time I published the beta.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.640]  And I think there were some subtle changes after that,
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.280]  but once the beta came out, nothing changed.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.360]  I don't think much changed that broke older articles,
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.640]  but there were 31 articles
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.400]  that I'd have to check for changes.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.720]  It was quite a pain in the ass.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.000]  It's a good thing I'm a perfectionist
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.600]  because otherwise the desire not to have to go
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.320]  and tediously edit these articles
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.080]  would have led me to just have shitty syntax in Markdown.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.400]  I think it's funny that when you announced Markdown,
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.720]  you got the same complaints that I always got
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.840]  when I tried to explain to people why I wrote in Markdown.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.360]  It's the exact, the argument was there fully formed
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.880]  at the beginning, which is why don't you just use HTML?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.440]  And there's a good answer why,
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.980]  which is I'm much less likely to make a mistake
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.760]  using this basic syntax and then compiling it into HTML
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.640]  than I am to making sure I get all the angle brackets
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.040]  and quote marks right, plus it's more readable.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.800]  But from day one, that was the question about Markdown.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.640]  Do you know what, to tie it
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.060]  with the earlier thing in the show,
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.600]  to me writing in Markdown feels like swimming downstream
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.600]  and writing raw HTML is upstream.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.080]  Ever so slightly, it's not hard.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.760]  HTML, raw HTML,
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.280]  especially if you're not doing the whole document,
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.960]  you're just doing the article portion
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.840]  where you have P tags and A tags for the links
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.400]  and stuff like that.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.200]  It's not terribly upstream, but it's subtly upstream.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.080]  And especially to me, and that's,
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.880]  not to turn this into a Markdown show
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.000]  instead of a Daring Fireball show,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.100]  but especially for reading what you've already written.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.520]  It's so much nicer.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.620]  I agree.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.260]  But those, that early, I guess two,
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.440]  almost two years of writes to amount,
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.120]  boy, that feels like, that really feels like old times to me.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.100]  That's the only part that really feels old to me.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.840]  Otherwise the weird thing about the 15 year anniversary
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.300]  and how much, I was 29 then, I'm 44 now.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.320]  I mean, that's, but 29 is by most people's definitions,
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.120]  a young man and 44 is clearly middle-aged.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.160]  It's a long 15 years,
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.800]  but it's still, Daring Fireball still feels new to me.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.380]  I don't, I can't explain why, but I think that's healthy.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.600]  I think so.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.420]  I think so.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.360]  My daughter is 15, right?
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.680]  And I, that seems not that long ago,
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.840]  and yet it also seems like forever ago.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.000]  And that's just, I get it.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.500]  I was trying to think of what I did
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.800]  before I wrote in Markdown.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.160]  And I think the answer is that I just wrote in plain text
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.400]  and I had a bunch of scripts that would wrap
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.340]  the paragraph tags around the plain text.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.000]  And then maybe I would just use, you know,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.160]  bold and italics tags and Ahrefs.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.100]  I think I would just put those in,
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.200]  but, and then I would just wrap it in paragraph tags
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.200]  at the end using a script and then paste it in somewhere.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.040]  I think that's what it is.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.100]  That is literally exactly how Markdown started.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.360]  Well, half the story of how Markdown started.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.040]  That's what I used to do for the first two years
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.000]  is write like in something that looked sort of like
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  Markdown, maybe without the italics tags, you know,
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.520]  for italics, I would actually put like an M in there,
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.740]  but no P tags.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:14.740]  And then at some point I'm so visually distracted
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:19.400]  by like it inline Ahref equals quote,
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.000]  here's a big long URL.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.880]  And inline links really distract me
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.100]  when reading the raw HTML.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.020]  You know, I had something that I could grep for to,
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:33.020]  you know, that in the first draft, I could, you know,
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.700]  keep the URLs out of the text.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.000]  But then once I was like, okay, this is done.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.840]  I'd like run a script or a couple of search and replace.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.860]  Then it was in HTML.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.860]  But then at that point,
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:45.740]  any subsequent edits had to be done in the HTML, right?
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.740]  It was like, you could do it up to your first, right?
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.820]  And so the idea was, well, why not try to make something,
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.260]  you know, and there was already a very popular textile
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.940]  plugin for movable type, you know, that would let,
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.340]  you know, it was the same idea as Markdown
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.980]  where you could keep it in that format.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.660]  And it would only, you know, every time you publish,
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.380]  it would just spit out a version.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.220]  But that's exactly what I did too.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.500]  All right, let me take a break and thank our next sponsor.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.120]  It's our good friends at Casper.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.180]  This is a mattress that was designed
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.800]  by a team of 20 mattress engineers.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.740]  That's a real deal.
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:24.820]  That's a real thing.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.780]  20 people who just engineer mattresses.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.000]  And then perfected by a community
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.020]  of nearly half a million sleepers
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.620]  who've given feedback to them
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.220]  and, you know, helped improve the product.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.000]  The mattress industry has forced consumers
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.900]  into paying notoriously high markups.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.460]  Mattresses are a huge rip off.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.560]  In general, the traditional mattresses are.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.540]  Casper is revolutionizing the mattress industry
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.580]  by cutting the cost of dealing with resellers
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.500]  and showrooms and all that stuff
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.800]  and passing the savings directly to you.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.020]  You just go to casper.com,
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.460]  you pick what size mattress you want
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.280]  and they ship it direct to you.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.820]  It's so super convenient.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.880]  Now because it's foam,
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.560]  it's not like a spring or something like that,
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.340]  what they can do is they can vacuum pack it
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:12.820]  and it comes in a remarkably small box for a mattress.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.420]  It might be the biggest box you get sent to you this month
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.460]  but considering that there's a whole mattress in there,
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.020]  it's actually remarkably small.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.380]  And then you take it up to the bedroom
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.260]  where you're gonna open it,
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.180]  you follow the instructions on the box
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.340]  and then it sucks all the oxygen out of the air
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.160]  so you gotta be careful
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.600]  because, you know, you might not be able to breathe.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.220]  And then there it is, a full-size mattress.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:33.500]  And it is great.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.980]  It is such a great mattress
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.380]  and it combines the pressure-relieving support
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:42.100]  of memory foam with a breathable open cell layer
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.980]  on the top for all-night comfort.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.720]  I said this the last time they sponsored the show,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.340]  this summer we went on vacation.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.620]  A lot of times you stay in a nice hotel,
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.180]  you get a really nice mattress.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.380]  My son who has a Casper mattress could not wait,
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.520]  the number one reason he couldn't wait
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.440]  to get home from vacation was to go back to bed
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.660]  on his Casper mattress, could not wait.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.740]  He's like addicted to it.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.660]  It's really, it's just a great product
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.880]  and they have affordable prices
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.460]  because they sell direct to you.
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.980]  They have free shipping to U.S. and Canada
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.340]  and they have a 100-night trial.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.580]  So any hesitation you might have
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.180]  over not being able to sit on it
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.180]  in a skanky mattress showroom
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.060]  and sort of, you know, bounce on it
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.220]  and see if you like it.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.940]  A hundred nights to sleep on it
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.620]  and they have a free no-hassle return policy
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.460]  if you're not happy.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.260]  You just go back to Casper.com, tell them you're not happy,
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.900]  they'll arrange for pickup and completely free of charge
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.040]  and with a full refund they'll take the mattress away.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.480]  So you can't lose.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.980]  They have over 20,000 reviews and an average of 4.8 stars
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.380]  based on Casper, Amazon and Google reviews
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.380]  and I can see why, it's just a great product
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.380]  and it's designed, developed and assembled
[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.940]  right here in the USA.
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:58.780]  So here's what you can do,
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.820]  you can dive deeper into the science
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.300]  behind the perfect mattress
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.420]  and get 50 bucks towards any regular mattress
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.900]  at casper.com slash the talk show
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.940]  and just remember that code, the talk show
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.140]  and you'll save the money.
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.460]  So thank you very much to Casper.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.660]  Love their product.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.980]  Next time you need a mattress, keep them in mind.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.540]  All right, I'm done talking
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.440]  about Daring Fireball's anniversary, are you?
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.140]  I mean, I thank everybody for the good words
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:30.780]  but let's start on the next 15.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.820]  You covered it, yeah.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.540]  All right, next on my list of topics
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.100]  is this new feature that Apple's added to iOS 11
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.060]  that people are calling like a cop mode.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.940]  But the basic idea is that there's a new feature in iOS 11
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:49.580]  where if you quickly tap the home button five times,
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.980]  it doesn't have to be super quick either.
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:54.600]  It brings up the emergency SOS screen
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.020]  where you can just slide to call 911
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.760]  and if you set up your phone with your medical information,
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.660]  it can just slide to unlock that.
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.460]  So for example, let's just say
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.420]  you've got some kind of medical condition
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.440]  and you pass out or have a seizure or something like that
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.980]  or you're in an accident and you're incapacitated.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.480]  A first responder, if they find an iPhone in your pocket,
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.700]  it wants this word spreads around,
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.500]  they can tap that button five times
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.020]  and if there's a medical thing
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.220]  and then tell them that you're allergic to penicillin
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.100]  like I am or something like that,
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.940]  there it is right there and they know how to get to it
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:30.940]  and they don't have to unlock your phone.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.060]  It's a great feature.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.820]  Well, in one of the most recent betas,
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.460]  I think it was like two betas ago,
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.020]  Apple added a feature to this
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.780]  where once you enter this SOS emergency screen
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.720]  to unlock your phone after that,
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.060]  you have to use the passcode, not touch ID.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.340]  So in the same way that when you power the phone off
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.940]  and this has been like this ever since touch ID came out
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:55.740]  and power it back on from being truly off, not just asleep,
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:00.680]  you have to enter the passcode before touch ID can work.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.740]  Now, this is really useful though for somebody,
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.780]  let's just say like if you're going through customs
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.940]  or something like that and let's face it,
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.780]  in today's world, it's a reasonable concern
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:13.460]  that you might wanna engage this mode
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:18.460]  and then you can't be required to use touch ID
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.400]  or coerced into using touch ID to unlock your phone.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.220]  I think this is a great feature
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:28.380]  and I think Apple's implemented it really, really well.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.300]  Yeah, the idea that you can do this,
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:32.760]  like just stick your finger in your pocket
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.060]  and press the button and you've deactivated touch ID
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.060]  essentially until you log in.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.520]  It's not, first off, this emergency ID thing
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.900]  is a really cool feature.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.900]  There's a version of it in now
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.980]  where if you get to the password screen,
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.580]  there's an emergency button
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.640]  and you can make an emergency call without logging in
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.620]  and there's also a personal data there.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.100]  You enter it through the health app.
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:16:00.100]  So I've got that in mind and the idea is first responders
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.260]  know that it's there and they know how to get to it
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.380]  and I don't have a medical alert bracelet.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.920]  I used to wear one because one of my pupils
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.760]  is larger than the other
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.960]  and that can lead to a misdiagnosis of a concussion
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:11.060]  when I don't have one.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.520]  And so I've got that in my medical info in my iPhone
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.180]  just as another place where they could gather info
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.900]  and it's got like my wife's name and phone number
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.340]  and some other health information about me
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.700]  and it's really useful.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.900]  But this adds this other layer of not only quick access,
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.780]  but the touch ID lockout,
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.740]  which everybody else was saying like lick your finger
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.660]  and then touch it on the button a few times
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.980]  until it fails and goes back to the password.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.660]  This is way better than that.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.580]  I should say that all these security experts will tell you
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.580]  that making your phone not able to open biometrically
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.780]  does not, and forgive me, this sounds terrible,
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.740]  but it's really accurate,
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.540]  does not stop them from beating it out of you.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.180]  If it's somebody who is a,
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.300]  if you're in a place with authorities
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.780]  who can get that out of you by some other means,
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.260]  your actual password, they can do that.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.860]  But in the United States, if they're following the law,
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:11.260]  they can't physically compel you to enter your password,
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.020]  but they, legally, but they can physically compel you
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:15.940]  to put your finger on your phone.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.820]  So that, it makes a difference, makes a difference.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.680]  At least according to some court cases
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.520]  that have already come out,
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.460]  I don't think it's actually gone to the Supreme Court
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.540]  and been officially decided,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.980]  but there have been court rulings
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:29.420]  that police can force somebody to require somebody
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.340]  to use their fingerprint.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.560]  And in one case, the funny part was that in the one case
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.020]  where it happened, the law enforcement got the judgment
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.460]  that said, yes, you can require this guy,
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.460]  you can't make him tell you your passcode,
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.580]  but you can make him put his finger on the thing.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.060]  But by the time they got the judgment,
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.740]  the timeout period had gone
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.140]  so that the phone required the passcode anyway,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.260]  which is, I enjoyed that very much.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.100]  Anyway, the other reason-
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.580]  I would imagine that they can't,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.700]  I imagine they can't force your finger onto the phone either
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.220]  that you have to sort of do it of your own free will,
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.280]  although there might be a court case
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.320]  about that at some point too.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.780]  Right, the other reason this is interesting
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:07.860]  is that there are rampant rumors
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.860]  that at least one of the new iPhones coming out,
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:16.860]  probably next month, is going to use 3D facial recognition
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.760]  as a biometric identification,
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.100]  either in addition to Touch ID or instead of Touch ID.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.740]  And I'm sure you've heard the same thing too,
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.020]  talking about it and writing about it
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.340]  over the last few months,
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.060]  is an awful lot of people who are very, very reasonably,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.340]  this is, I'm not making fun of or disagreeing at all,
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.980]  but who are very, very reasonably wary
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:43.980]  of having something where the law enforcement
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.820]  wouldn't even need to force you
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.260]  to put your finger on the thing.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.100]  If you're being held,
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.680]  they could just hold the phone in front of your face
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.520]  and unlock it.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.140]  Totally reasonable concern, it actually, I agree,
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.860]  it would be easier for law enforcement
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:02.860]  to get into a phone with facial recognition than Touch ID.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.820]  And this is an interesting thing
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.340]  where once you anticipate that this is going to happen,
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.300]  you're literally just five quick taps away
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:11.900]  from locking them out of that.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.060]  I do wonder about this Face ID feature
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:23.660]  that I would think that it would be constructed in a way
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.220]  where it would try very hard to get the sense
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.180]  of whether you were holding your phone or not, right?
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.500]  That it would be one of the fundamental things here
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.620]  is somebody across the table from you
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.380]  cannot pick up your phone, unlock it,
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.180]  and then start looking through your email.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.100]  Somebody can't walk away with your phone
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.060]  and then from across the room surreptitiously
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.820]  as you're looking frantically for your phone,
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.220]  hold it toward you,
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.620]  and then get all your information out of it.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.480]  That it needs to be able to,
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.180]  if it's gonna have this wide angle lens
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.780]  and have an idea of sort of like where your face is,
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.900]  it should actually be able to make a judgment
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.500]  about like you're not close enough
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.060]  for me to unlock at this point.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.700]  That has to be part of the deal.
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.380]  Yeah, you would think so.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:11.220]  And I would anticipate that assuming that this pans out,
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.840]  this is gonna be a significant segment
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.140]  of the keynote address introducing the phone,
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.500]  explaining how it works and the way it tries to be smart.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.540]  Just to scratch another thing
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:26.000]  off the things I've been meaning to talk about here,
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.020]  just to alleviate a nonstop stream of feedback
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:34.360]  from listeners is skepticism from people
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.600]  who hear about this feature
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.180]  and think this is going to be terrible.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.380]  I don't wanna have to hold my phone in front of my face
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.800]  like I'm taking a selfie every single time
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.180]  I wanna unlock the phone.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.700]  If you ask your concern,
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:47.860]  you're thinking about this all wrong.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.500]  There's no way Apple would use this
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.640]  if that was how it worked.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.660]  It's not like taking a picture of yourself.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:53.500]  I'm sure of it.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.540]  I know nothing of this.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.980]  I've heard, I have no little birdies
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.940]  who've told me about this.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.540]  I just, just knowing Apple,
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:02.580]  they wouldn't add the feature if that's how limited it was.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.460]  Surely it's something that worked
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.540]  with a very wide range of view
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.660]  so that it's not like taking a picture.
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:12.540]  It may not even be a camera per se,
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.100]  that it's just some sort of 3D IR sensor.
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.380]  Oh, and the other thing is that of course
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.220]  it'll work in the dark.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.500]  And I think there's even rumors
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.560]  coming out of the supply chain
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.800]  that it's an infrared system,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.380]  that it's not like you won't be able to unlock your phone
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:29.500]  unless you turn the lights on in the middle of the night.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.380]  It's just not that sort of thing at all.
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.580]  Yeah, I am fascinated.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:37.180]  Look, I mean, bad products exist, bad features exist.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.700]  It absolutely is the case.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:43.100]  I am fascinated by, I think it must just be human nature
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:46.900]  that some people will hear about something
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.820]  and immediately imagine the worst case scenario
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.060]  and then attack that and say,
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.700]  that sounds terrible because I had this happen to me
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.100]  the other week where I forget even what it was.
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.140]  I think it was like the plot to a movie or something.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.460]  And somebody said, oh, well, that's gonna be terrible
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:01.660]  because it's gonna be like this.
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:04.380]  And I thought, well, you just imagined the worst thing
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.580]  and then said it would be bad.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.500]  But you did that, not the people who are making the movie.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.540]  That was you and your creativity finding something bad.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:16.700]  Like the bar for biometric unlocking on the iPhone
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.820]  is so high.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.320]  This is such a core feature.
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:23.860]  It is so not, if you think back to the iPhone 7 Plus
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.180]  and the two cameras, right?
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.740]  That was a, oh, well, it's gonna be in beta
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.420]  and it's not really done yet and all of that.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:34.300]  That was not a core feature of the OS.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.300]  This is a core feature.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:39.540]  So if you are imagining a scenario
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.100]  where there's gonna be a new iPhone
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.860]  and the only way you're gonna be able to unlock it
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.180]  is with this janky face unlock
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:48.660]  that requires you to smile and take a selfie
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.980]  and turn on the light if it's too dark and things like that.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.540]  Like if they were at that point,
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.860]  they would have killed the feature.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.700]  You have to be wearing the same pair of glasses
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.940]  that you were wearing when you first set it up.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.700]  No, it cannot work like that.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.440]  It cannot work like that.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.660]  No, they would have killed that.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.260]  And in fact, I wonder sometimes if,
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.520]  cause I remember this rumor has floated around before.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.460]  I wonder if they have been testing this a while
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.100]  and it was just not good enough.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.340]  And that only now is it good enough for them to do it.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:19.780]  But there's just no way that Apple is gonna ship this thing.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.540]  Now, might it have quirks, especially at first?
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.500]  Sure, but it's just,
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.900]  I cannot envision Apple screwing up something as important
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.500]  as a biometric ID system.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.700]  Like this has got to work rock solid
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.140]  or they would never have put it in production.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.460]  Yeah, and touch ID is where the bar is.
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.020]  And really it's not just like touch ID
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.780]  from three or four years ago with the iPhone 5S,
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:49.660]  it's where touch ID is today with the iPhone 7 and iOS 10
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:54.020]  and just how quick, I don't know, for me at least,
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.440]  I can't imagine how making touch ID faster
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.940]  would improve anything.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.460]  Cause it doesn't seem to me like
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.740]  it's as close to instantaneous as I desire.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.900]  And the goal is for this to be seamless.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.660]  I have to think the reason they're doing this
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:09.140]  is because they want the ultimate experience
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:10.520]  of using an iPhone to be
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.340]  that when you're holding your iPhone,
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:14.860]  it knows it and everything just works.
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.860]  And when you're not, it's locked.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:17.760]  And how do you do that?
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.660]  Well, there's technology and infrared
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.140]  and who knows what else is going on behind the scenes.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.380]  But from a user's perspective,
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.900]  leaving all the tech aside,
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.580]  what Apple, the ultimate goal is
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.040]  when you're using your phone,
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.160]  it works fine and you have access to everything.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.740]  And when you're not, it's locked, right?
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.660]  And if this is how they're doing that,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.020]  the goal here is that you shouldn't have to,
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:38.580]  touch ID is not a great burden, right?
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:41.100]  But what they're saying is you shouldn't even need that.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.380]  All you should need to be is physically present
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.340]  and the phone will figure out,
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.260]  oh, you're here, then here's all your stuff.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.740]  Yeah.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.820]  And possibly could even lock automatically
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.060]  just when your face is no longer within the field of view.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:59.220]  I don't know, maybe or something.
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.060]  Yeah.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.880]  I don't know, there's all sorts of potential there,
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.500]  but Apple knows the bar is high
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.500]  and Apple does make mistakes too.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.340]  That's the other thing.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.600]  The argument here is an Apple never is perfect,
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.980]  never screws anything up,
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.820]  but I would argue that they never screw up
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.340]  anything like this.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.720]  Like by, and I know that there are phones out there
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.300]  that have facial scanners for identification.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.460]  And I know that every single one
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.220]  that's already out there sucks in some way.
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:29.260]  It's either foolable by a flat still picture of the person
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:34.260]  or it's slow or it has to be a narrow field of view
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.060]  or something like that.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.620]  I know that there's a bunch out there that suck,
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:40.900]  but Apple would, there's no way they would make one
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:43.040]  that sucks when they already have a biometric ID,
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.740]  touch ID that it doesn't suck.
[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:48.060]  And touch ID, when it was rumored,
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.380]  we heard these same stories
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.280]  because there had been fingerprint readers.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.640]  Like I think Samsung had one where you kind of had to like
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.020]  move your thumb like over it slowly,
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:58.800]  like you were swiping a credit card somewhere,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.660]  like you had to slowly slide your thumb over it
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.220]  and it was a bad experience.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.460]  And then Apple did it and it was not that experience.
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.940]  It was much better.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:08.820]  And like, yeah, I just really believe,
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:11.120]  not that Apple doesn't make mistakes,
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.960]  but that this is such a core feature
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:17.660]  that if it was no good, the phone just wouldn't ship.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:19.740]  They would have a different phone without it.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.020]  Disney World for years has had a thing
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.900]  where they have in Florida,
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:26.700]  the Florida parks have a thing where you would,
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:29.000]  to get in the park, you have to put your finger on a thing.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.980]  You give them your ticket or scan your band or whatever,
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.020]  and then you use your finger.
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:37.300]  And the idea is it's obviously a method
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.500]  of trying to prevent a single pass
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.380]  from being used by multiple people, right?
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:47.120]  Whether for the day or like if you have like an annual pass
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.960]  or something like that,
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.620]  you can't just let your cousins use it
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:50.820]  or something like that.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.660]  And it works pretty great
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.500]  in terms of how quickly you expect
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:58.600]  to go through the turnstile at a theme park,
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.940]  but it's way slower than you would ever want for your phone.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:04.460]  If your iPhone unlocked at the speed
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.700]  that the Disney World turnstiles do,
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.700]  recognizing your fingerprint, no one would use touch ID.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.340]  Everyone would do everything with their passcode.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.300]  They wouldn't even, you wouldn't even bother
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.420]  setting up touch ID.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:18.940]  And so I remember when this was announced
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.740]  back with the 5S and people, I remember people saying,
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:22.900]  like, John, you go to Disney World.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.140]  I know that, you know, this is gonna suck.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.100]  And it's like, ah, come on,
[01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:27.460]  they got, it has to be better than that.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.500]  And of course it was way better than that.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.460]  Yeah.
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:33.780]  Which we could kind of,
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:37.380]  we could kind of quickly segue
[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.140]  into Gurman's article on this point,
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.940]  but I don't wanna make a big segment out of it.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.980]  But Mark Gurman had a story in Bloomberg the other day
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:49.820]  that the premise of which was that Apple's success
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:53.440]  is because they're very good at following the features
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.580]  from other phones that come out first.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:00.520]  And the reason it's not even worth going into
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.820]  is that the article was very just bad
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:05.380]  because the actual article itself
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.680]  and the artwork that accompanied it,
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.420]  like he listed like 13 features
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.380]  and eight out of the 13 features he listed
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.820]  were in iPhones before they were in competing phones.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.500]  But one of them, the thing that made me think of it
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.900]  was that he listed the fingerprint scanner
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:22.660]  as a thing that came out in a competing phone first
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.080]  and that Apple followed.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.900]  But that's, you know, like the Motorola one that had that,
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.380]  it was truly awful.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.580]  I mean, every single review,
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.020]  I even looked a couple of them up the other day
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.500]  when I was thinking about writing Gurman's story.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.420]  And it's like, everybody said, this is terrible.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.100]  This is absolutely horrible.
[01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:38.740]  And Touch ID right from day one
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.020]  was actually really kind of amazingly good.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.540]  So, I mean, if you really wanna be pedantic,
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.820]  you can say, yes, Apple was the follower there.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.160]  But the fact that all phones,
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.560]  all modern phones across operating systems today
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.000]  have fast, accurate, trustworthy fingerprint scanners,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.960]  you know, Apple led the way on that.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.320]  You know, one of the things in that story
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.760]  is about like mobile payments.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.800]  And I mean, you read the story as basically being
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.760]  Apple doesn't have to be first, but they do it right.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.080]  They have to do it right.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.460]  And I think that's accurate.
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.440]  I think that that's an accurate way of viewing Apple
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.960]  is that Apple isn't always first and people who claim,
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.400]  oh, look at Apple, they're just copying X.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.780]  The point is not to be first,
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.360]  but to be the one that does it right.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.880]  And that leads to sour grapes of like,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.720]  how is it that Apple gets all this credit
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.400]  when this other company did it first?
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.720]  And the answer is because Apple did it better
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.200]  and Apple Pay is the perfect example, right?
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.380]  Like Google Wallet existed three years,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.400]  three and a half years before Apple Pay was launched
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.360]  and nobody cared.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.340]  And then Apple did Apple Pay and they did it right
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:41.960]  and they launched it properly.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:46.360]  And, you know, Google recast their payment as Android Pay
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.040]  and Samsung did Samsung Pay.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.760]  And it was all just, let's do what Apple just did.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.600]  And so, no, Apple wasn't first,
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.920]  but Apple was the first one to do it right.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.400]  Now that isn't always the case.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.960]  Like OLED, they like list OLED and it's like,
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.960]  well, the early OLED screens weren't really great
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.280]  and there was a reason,
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.520]  but recently there have been some very good phones
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.680]  with OLED screens and Apple hasn't done it yet.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.080]  So that's a place where Apple's a little behind.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.520]  And I think you pointed out on Twitter
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.680]  that the big screen thing is the most obvious one.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.720]  Like Apple was lagged way behind
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.840]  in having a large screened phone
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.800]  when that was clearly a successful market category.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.120]  Yeah, and that was baffling to me
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.560]  that Gurman didn't even mention that
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.600]  because that's the one where his premise
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.440]  was closest to being true,
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.160]  which is that the competing phones had it, Apple didn't.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.720]  It was in demand.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.480]  I mean, famously came out.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.740]  It's one of those rare insights
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.360]  into Apple's internal deliberations
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.640]  where there was an email thread that came out
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:45.040]  thanks to the subpoenas or whatever you wanna call it
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.800]  during the Apple Samsung lawsuit,
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.200]  but that an internal Apple presentation
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.960]  introduced as evidence.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.720]  And I think the exact phrase was
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.680]  consumers want what we don't have,
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.160]  meaning five plus inch phones.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.000]  Right.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.560]  You know, I think marketing,
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.560]  I think product marketing wise,
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.800]  the correct time for Apple to introduce
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.720]  the plus size phones would have been with the iPhone 5.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.320]  I don't know if they were about two years behind on that.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.160]  Totally.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:18.980]  Because of how far in advance
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:22.400]  they have to plan their supply chain for iPhones,
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.680]  there was no way,
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.420]  it was literally impossible for them
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.560]  to pivot quicker than that.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.360]  Like they were already committed
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.160]  when the iPhone 5 came out,
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.000]  they were already fully committed to the iPhone 5S
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.720]  as their next year strategy
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:38.080]  with no phone bigger than four inches.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.560]  Yeah, and there was a software component too,
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.160]  which really hamstrung them is that they had,
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.040]  the apps were all designed for that pixel perfect layout
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.800]  and that they struggled to get even like iPhone 5 apps
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.940]  that were taller.
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.440]  And obviously at WWDC like the next year,
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:59.440]  they really leaned into basically size independent layout
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.400]  of apps because they were going in that direction.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.560]  But like, even if they had shipped a five plus,
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.840]  I'm not sure, I mean, they just,
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.400]  the software was not ready to take advantage of it yet.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.300]  They would have really struggled with apps.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.000]  They would have been upscaling apps and things like that.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.600]  Because they weren't, the OS needed a couple more years
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.200]  to get to the point where they could scale.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.440]  Yeah, but they really got caught flat-footed on that.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:27.000]  And because it was the sort of thing that would take,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.200]  you know, two years of supply chain planning
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.920]  and maybe, you know, probably roughly,
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.520]  I mean, the software side's a little squishier.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.920]  It's not quite as cut and dry as hardware,
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.960]  but you know, like you're right.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:41.120]  Like there was about a two year transition period in iOS
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.860]  where, you know, the way that you do layout
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.960]  was shifted from, you know, pixel perfect designs
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.960]  to these, I forget what the term is, but, you know,
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.760]  and it plays out now in things like having
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.320]  a narrow column app on the iPad,
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.900]  that's roughly an iPad or iPhone width,
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.900]  but goes the full height of the iPad screen.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.600]  All of that stuff came about over the course
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.720]  of like two or three revisions of iOS,
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.680]  which is an annual thing.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.120]  Yeah, so you're right.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:13.920]  It's funny to see this perception and how it is,
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.040]  you know, I don't think it's wrong.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:15.880]  I don't know.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.920]  I mean, Mark Gurman knows a lot about Apple.
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.060]  So the weirdness is in the story.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.240]  Sometimes I wonder since he's been at Bloomberg,
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.480]  how much of this is him and how much of it
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.200]  is his sort of superiors who want to do this kind of story
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.600]  and they've got an idea of a narrative and, you know,
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.880]  because it's not, that's what's weird about the story
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.920]  is it's not wrong, it's just also not quite right
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.400]  and it kind of misses the mark about what Apple
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.600]  is trying to do here because it is true
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.800]  that Apple is sometimes behind in new tech,
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.560]  not always, but sometimes, but sometimes they're the one
[01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.760]  who, you know, they make their first cut the right cut
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.920]  instead of doing what their competitors sometimes do,
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.480]  which is rush something out before it's ready.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.280]  You're right from a couple of minutes ago.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.140]  You're right that there's a very good story in this,
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.120]  which is primarily about Apple only doing things one,
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.620]  you know, releasing things once they're up
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.140]  to a certain standard and many opposing, you know,
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.960]  opposite companies, competing companies,
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.220]  having a lesser standard of, well,
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:15.920]  we've got a fingerprint scanner that quote works,
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.580]  so let's stick it in the phone.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.240]  There's an interesting story there, but this story isn't it.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.600]  Like it, and again, point by point,
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.160]  it's not that his article was wrong,
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.780]  but the central premise was clearly wrong,
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.120]  which is that Apple always follows.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:35.120]  Yeah, the janky thing about like janky face unlock
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.680]  detection stuff, like you could say, oh, Samsung had,
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.480]  you know, facial recognition and face detection
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:42.320]  a long time ago.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.760]  They had that goofy feature where like,
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.960]  you're watching a movie and your eyes look away
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.500]  for a moment and it pauses the video,
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.760]  which is not what anybody ever, ever, ever wants.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.640]  You must stare at this movie.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.960]  Don't look away, not even for a second,
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.880]  but they did have something, right?
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.600]  It was just not very good.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.080]  And that's the difference is if it reminds me of the days
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.080]  when there were all these Mac versus PC articles
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.280]  and there was all these check boxes and they'd be like,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.360]  oh, you know, the Mac doesn't have that.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.760]  And as a Mac user, you'd be like, wait,
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.640]  but that's not a thing that works on the Mac.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.460]  Why is that relevant?
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.760]  And if you boil it down to that level,
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.960]  if it's that reductive, you can get,
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:22.520]  it can be kind of misleading.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.600]  And I see some of that in this.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.460]  Yeah, I was gonna say that, I'm glad you brought that up,
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:30.880]  but the checkbox checklist comparisons,
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:35.040]  Apple has never fared well on and never will
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.120]  as long as they remain the Apple that we know.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.480]  And I think there is something to the fact
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.320]  that their struggles in the mid nineties,
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.640]  part of it was based on that,
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.560]  that so much of the growth of the PC industry
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.560]  from say 1985 to 95 was driven by businesses
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.520]  and that sort of checklist comparison of,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.000]  we can get all these check marks
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.480]  and pay this much $700 with this option.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.360]  And we only get these three check marks over here
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.080]  and it costs $800.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.480]  So we can get more check marks for less money
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.600]  with this, whether it's a software package
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.560]  or this PC hardware or something like that.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.120]  Apple has never done well with that.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.040]  You've got to understand why Apple products are desirable.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.080]  You've really got to thoroughly explore
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.160]  the overall experience.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.880]  All right, because otherwise you're gonna say,
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.680]  facial recognition check, right?
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.800]  That Samsung thing that paused your movie
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.800]  when you weren't looking at it.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.680]  Like, okay, that check, right?
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.880]  And years before, but it's not the same and it's not,
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.160]  or Apple pay is a good example of like,
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.160]  well, it's just a rip off of the thing
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.040]  that Google did three years before, right?
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.440]  Except it wasn't, the way it was implemented was different,
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.160]  but you can't reduce it to that.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.240]  And again, yeah, it's a good,
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.440]  this is a really meaty topic
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.400]  because this is how you compete
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.200]  and this is how Apple does what it does
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.800]  is like deciding the right time to spring.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.000]  And sometimes they don't make it right.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.520]  Sometimes they can't ship it.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.120]  Sometimes they don't think it's an issue,
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.160]  which is I think what it was with a large phone.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160]  I think that for a while,
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.960]  they just didn't believe that those phones
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.480]  were gonna be truly popular and then they had to scramble.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.640]  I didn't, I personally didn't.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.560]  And I think I have a mindset that is very copacetic
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.840]  to those people who work and design things at Apple
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.440]  and just picking up an inert, don't use it.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.800]  Just pick up a big plus.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.160]  I still think it today, honestly, with the iPhone Plus,
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.280]  I don't like the size.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.240]  I really don't.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.080]  I agree.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.080]  It's not for us, right?
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.520]  So we're just willing to go along and say,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.760]  sure, I don't see the appeal of it,
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.640]  but I'm not sure Samsung did either,
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.680]  but Samsung, their whole strategy is just make all the phones
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.800]  and all the sizes and see what happens
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.400]  and that one hit and to their credit.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.440]  And in hindsight, I can kind of see the mistake
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.440]  where imagine a world where every MacBook is a,
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.240]  like a MacBook Air or the 12 inch MacBook
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.640]  and all the competitors copied it.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.080]  And so all of the laptops are that size.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:24.040]  And then somebody comes out with a 15 inch laptop
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.240]  and you'd be like, well, that's ridiculous.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.520]  It's gonna break your back.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.160]  It's not gonna fit in your bag.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.800]  And you can't use it on an airplane seat.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.000]  This is ridiculous.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.720]  But of course, since the laptop world
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.880]  didn't really evolve that way,
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.960]  it evolved with multiple choices
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.080]  and started big and got small
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.200]  instead of starting small and getting big.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.200]  Nobody thinks it's goofy that Apple offers
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.840]  a range of laptop sizes from the 12 inch MacBook
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:52.600]  up to the 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.040]  Yeah, and going back to our point about keyboards earlier,
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.520]  sometimes it's great to have that steward who says,
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.480]  I think this is what you're looking for.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.120]  But that can be too extreme to where you make,
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.200]  I hear this about the MacBooks all the time, right?
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.480]  Where people who don't like the new MacBook keyboard,
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.920]  it's like, sorry, it's everywhere now.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.760]  You don't get the choice.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:15.800]  There is, if you want a Mac laptop, you get that keyboard.
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.320]  And that's the end of the discussion.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.720]  And I think the iPhone was very much like that,
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.000]  where some of it was the way the operating system was set.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.520]  The apps were so great,
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.120]  but they were all tied to that very particular screen
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.520]  real estate and the OS needed to be updated
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.400]  and the apps needed to be updated to change it.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.240]  So that was part of it.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.960]  But part of it was Apple, the original iPhone did so well
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.080]  that Apple's like, well, this is, we nailed it.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.040]  This is the only phone we need to make.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.240]  And it took Apple quite a while to realize
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:46.840]  maybe we need more sizes of iPhone,
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.480]  just like we have more sizes of the laptop.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.720]  And it took them too long.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:54.720]  It took them too long.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.360]  At their best, Apple is solely focused on experience.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.480]  And that's really what it always comes down to.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.200]  And so I can see like at a technical level,
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.880]  if you just like, if let's say we were at,
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.240]  you and I are assigned to the team to make a phone
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.040]  that detects when you're looking at the screen
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.400]  and can pause a movie when your eyes move away.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.880]  And imagine it sounds like a cool project, right?
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.880]  Like to actually just the engineering of having,
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.440]  well, what kind of sensors do we need?
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.600]  Is a camera good enough?
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.800]  Do we need some other sensor that can specifically
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.400]  look at some kind of retina scanning type thing?
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.160]  Or do we need infrared?
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.000]  What do we need?
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:36.840]  And get the hardware working.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.240]  And then you get the software,
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:40.360]  you just blindly go and get it all working.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.600]  And imagine you get it working like perfectly.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.280]  And it's like every single time you avert your eyes,
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.600]  the movie pauses and it's like high fives all around,
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.880]  this works great.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.480]  And then you just ship it in the phone
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.520]  and never really thinking like,
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.960]  is this actually a desirable experience?
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.880]  Which it's not, right?
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.680]  You've done all this hard work and I don't even know
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:01.940]  because I didn't have that phone.
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.120]  So I don't even know if it was actually
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.600]  very accurate technically.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.200]  But let's just give them the benefit of the doubt
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.840]  that they solved all the technical problems
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.280]  and got it working as perfectly as it could be.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:16.080]  As well as touch ID works for fingerprint sensing.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.280]  They've just created a feature
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.320]  that sounds like hell on earth.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.640]  Yeah, it's a brilliant piece of technology
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.040]  and is not how anybody actually wants to use it.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:32.400]  And that's, you're right, that Apple at its worst,
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.380]  that's what happens.
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:35.480]  But Apple's culture is built around
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.240]  not letting that kind of thing happen.
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.600]  The technology for technology's sake.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.960]  It's like, why would somebody want to do this?
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.640]  And you start with that.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.800]  Although I have to give a lot of people credit
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.240]  because the iPhone 7 removing the headphone jack
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.880]  is apparently now a feature to be emulated
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.000]  except for the LeEco phone,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.640]  which really trailblazed that category
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.560]  by not having a headphone jack.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.040]  That might've been the biggest eye roll
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.460]  in Gurman's article was not giving Apple credit
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:06.820]  for removal of a headphone jack.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.540]  A, calling it a feature and B,
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.260]  not giving them credit for trailblazing that.
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.040]  When the example was a company
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.060]  that literally nobody on earth had ever heard of.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.520]  Like there's people who work at LeEco
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.160]  who'd never heard of the company.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.600]  The eyeball tracking deposit movie reminds me
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.680]  of there's like a whole class of jokes like this
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.920]  of people getting sent to hell.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.040]  Like the version I remember for some reason
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.240]  is some guy who's an avid golfer,
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.520]  has a heart attack and feels his soul going down
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.720]  instead of up and thinks, oh God, this is terrible.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.840]  I'm spending eternity in hell.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.880]  And then he gets there and they welcome him.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.520]  And first thing he gets is a brand new set
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.200]  of pink golf clubs.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.040]  He's like, what the hell?
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.200]  And then they opened the gates
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:54.400]  and hell is an exact replica of Augusta National Golf Course.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.960]  And it's just in beautiful condition
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.640]  and the weather is perfect.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.040]  And the devil's there to greet me.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:42:59.860]  He's like, what's going on?
[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.700]  This is hell?
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.540]  And the devil says, oh yeah.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.140]  And he says, you want a tea time for tomorrow?
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.080]  And he's like, sure, that'd be great.
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:07.920]  And he's like, all right.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.280]  And he's checking out the bag
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.760]  and he goes, where do I go to get golf balls?
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.560]  And the devil goes, golf balls?
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.780]  Right?
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.920]  It reminds me like you get sent to hell
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.160]  and you're like, they give you a phone
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.480]  and you can watch all the movies you want
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.560]  but every time you move your eyes away,
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.400]  it's gonna pause.
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.660]  Like it just sounds like it's on that spectrum of, you know.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:29.500]  Clockwork orange, you know.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.040]  All right, let me take a break here
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.080]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:39.000]  He's a brand new sponsor of the show.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.040]  I'm very excited about this.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.620]  And I think they have a very interesting,
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.780]  very innovative product.
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.900]  It's a company called Aftershokz.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:52.100]  And they spell it A-F-T-E-R S-H-O-K-Z.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.100]  Aftershokz makes headphones
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.280]  and they work by bone conduction.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.580]  I'd never even heard of this before.
[01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:03.300]  But the way it works is that they have small transducers
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.700]  that rest in front of your ears.
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:08.980]  They don't go inside your ears like earbuds
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.420]  and they don't go around them like most big headphones.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.180]  And what they do is they send many vibrations
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:18.860]  through your cheekbones directly to your inner ear,
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.100]  bypassing your ears and eardrums.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.580]  Now that sounds like it wouldn't even work.
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.420]  I remember reading this.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:28.880]  They sent me a pair and it's kind of amazing.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.860]  Like the first second or two,
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.460]  it's like, whoa, what the heck is going on?
[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:32.780]  And then you get used to it
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.700]  and you just hear very clear audio.
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.460]  So unlike every other kind of headphone,
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.060]  bone conduction leaves your ears completely open
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.060]  with nothing in them.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:47.220]  And there are some major, major benefits like this.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:48.980]  This means that if you're using them in an environment
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:51.780]  where you wanna hear the outside world to some degree,
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:54.940]  like if you're living in a city like I do
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.380]  and you wanna be able to hear traffic and stuff like that
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:58.980]  while you're listening to stuff,
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.420]  you hear more of the outside world with these
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.180]  than you do with in-ear earbuds.
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.720]  Another one, and this is huge,
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.500]  and I know that there are tons of people out there like this
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:12.740]  who just can't wear earbuds.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:14.940]  It either physically hurts their ears
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:17.300]  or they don't stay in and they fall out
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.340]  because there's a million different shapes of ears
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.340]  and stuff like that.
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.300]  Aftershocks headphones don't have this problem
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:26.980]  because nothing goes inside your ear.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:29.120]  They're great for exercise in hot weather too.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.300]  They stay in place and they're IP55 certified
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.180]  for water resistance.
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.580]  So any kind of like sweatiness or rain
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.340]  or anything like this, you do not need the care.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.640]  They're designed for this.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.180]  It's really an amazing technology.
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.860]  It really blows my mind that it's actually sending
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.500]  vibrations through my cheekbones and I can hear them.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.880]  But really the fact that you can hear the sound
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.360]  from the outside world around you
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.620]  is just the game changer in this.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.860]  Another one I can just imagine if you're like a parent
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:58.460]  and you've got like a baby or something like that,
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:00.800]  you wanna be able to hear the baby
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.540]  if you're listening to stuff all day long.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.580]  It's absolutely great for that.
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:05.420]  What's the downside?
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.920]  Well, the downside is they're not good
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:09.940]  for really noisy surroundings where you wanna block out
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:12.060]  the surrounding sound, but there's all sorts of,
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:15.020]  that's what existing headphones are already great at.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.780]  It's really, really great.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:17.860]  They're wireless.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:21.200]  That's the Trex titanium model, which they sent me.
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:26.080]  Battery life is quoted at six hours of playback
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.380]  and 10 hours of standby.
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:31.420]  I found that they easily match that.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:34.220]  Definitely not something you have to charge
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:38.060]  after like listening to a two-hour podcast, cough, cough.
[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:41.900]  You easily get through six hours
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.700]  and they come with a two-year warranty.
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:49.700]  Aftershocks Trex titanium, they retail for 130 bucks,
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:53.500]  but you, you dear listener of the talk show,
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:56.860]  can snag a pair for just $99.95.
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:58.300]  Let's call it 100 bucks.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:02.260]  By visiting tts.aftershocks.com.
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:07.260]  That's tts for the talk show dot aftershocks.com.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:10.280]  I think that's the first sponsor that I can recall
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.500]  that used a, what do you call that?
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.940]  A domain name thing instead of a slash TTS.
[01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:20.700]  So that's pretty clever right there.
[01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.660]  So my thanks to Aftershocks for sponsoring the show.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:26.420]  And if you are the type of person who is totally dissatisfied
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:29.580]  with over-the-ear headphones or in-ear ear pods,
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:32.580]  I implore you to check them out because this,
[01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:33.600]  it totally works.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.980]  It is really, really great sound.
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:38.300]  So my thanks to them for checking them out
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.500]  or for sponsoring the show, I should say.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.540]  What's next on our agenda there, Jason?
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.100]  It looks like, do we need to talk about favicons?
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.500]  Yeah, that was something I wrote about recently.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.080]  I don't think we have to spend a lot of time on this,
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.340]  but I do want to, I just want to quickly say
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:00.100]  that it, I don't know, you might've been traveling
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.920]  when I wrote that article, but.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.500]  Oh no, no, that was right before I left,
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:07.940]  because I wrote a thing about whether they,
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.100]  for me, the core thing here,
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.680]  cause I mean the short version is Chrome shows
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.500]  the little favicon thing that is,
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:19.240]  that's been around forever in tabs and Safari doesn't,
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.780]  and should it is question one.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:26.100]  And for me, it always comes back to the pinned tabs thing
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:29.100]  that they added last year on Mac OS,
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.940]  which is in a completely different format.
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.960]  It's an SVG, so it's resolution independent
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.700]  and it's a single color essentially.
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.980]  And it's a silhouette when it's not selected
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.100]  and once selected, you can choose,
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:46.860]  you define what color shows up as the color of your shape.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.780]  And that's it.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.800]  So Apple invented this entire feature
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.880]  that's like outdoing the favicon.
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.900]  And so I'm not sure Apple really ever wants
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:48:59.300]  to put anything in the tab,
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:01.180]  especially since it's not in any of the other tabs
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:04.060]  anywhere else in Sierra,
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:06.300]  which they added the ability to put tabs everywhere,
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.940]  but none of them have icons.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:08.780]  So that's one.
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.660]  And two, like if they really liked that format,
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:14.340]  the favicon format that every website has,
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.880]  why would they have invented their own
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:16.940]  when they did pin tabs?
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.340]  But they did, they totally invented their own format that,
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.340]  and that's separate still from thing
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:24.700]  that I don't think anybody mentioned,
[01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:27.260]  which is the touch icon,
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:30.300]  which is what happens if you save a bookmark
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:33.340]  to your home screen on an iPhone or an iOS device,
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.740]  that's a different format altogether that is also available.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:38.300]  So I don't know.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.280]  I mean, I think the simple answer may be
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.600]  that Apple doesn't think that you need an icon in your tabs,
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:47.140]  but it is kind of funny that Apple keeps trying
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.060]  to invent new formats because the existing formats
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.400]  that are on the web aren't good enough for them.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.420]  So I think it makes sense that the touch icon is different
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:57.980]  because it needs to be bigger than a favicon.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:49:59.820]  So it needs to be a different image.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.960]  There's nobody who has a favicon that's big enough
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:05.340]  to look good stretched to the size of an icon
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:06.500]  on the home screen.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:10.860]  My guess, and it's somewhat informed,
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:15.860]  is that this issue is divisive within Apple.
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:19.460]  There's certainly, there's a lot of people within Apple
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:23.860]  who wish that Safari showed favicons on the tabs
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.180]  and have for years, and there's another contingent
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:30.300]  that is opposed to it on,
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:31.860]  this part is a little bit speculative,
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.740]  but I can't even imagine what else it is on aesthetic grounds
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:39.700]  that a bunch of randomly colored tabs,
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:44.700]  icons on tabs is aesthetically discordant,
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:46.580]  perhaps is a way to put it,
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.680]  as opposed to what it looks like now,
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:53.140]  which is monochromatic and I mean,
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:56.140]  even the toolbar buttons in modern Mac design
[01:50:56.140 --> 01:51:01.140]  are all monochrome, which in some ways I can see
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:03.180]  that does look good, but in other ways,
[01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:08.000]  I think suffers usability wise where having a stop sign
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.180]  for like a stop button be read
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:13.140]  actually is a little bit easier to identify quickly
[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:15.280]  than having a monochrome one.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.540]  And I think that the monochrome crowd won out.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:22.520]  And so my guess is to, and this is truly just a guess,
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.560]  is my guess is that when they did pin tabs,
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.900]  the pin tabs, the whole idea
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:28.100]  is that they're supposed to be super small
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.480]  and therefore you need them to be iconified.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.040]  There's no way that you can use text to notify,
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.940]  the whole point is supposed to have a little tiny tab
[01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:37.840]  over on the side that is there all the time.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.900]  So it has to be an icon, but if the argument within them,
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.420]  all the, you know, it was mostly based
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:44.380]  on not having random color elements
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.740]  and sticking to a monochrome aesthetic,
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:50.060]  they kind of needed to introduce their own format
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.880]  so that they'd be in a format that would look good monochrome
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.940]  because you can't just take any,
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:57.020]  you can't just take any fav, some would look good,
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.660]  some fav icons like daring fireballs might look good
[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:02.160]  if you took all the color out of them,
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.180]  might not look that different at all.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:08.340]  Others might be rendered, you know, unidentifiable.
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:11.040]  And so if you're going to introduce a new format,
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:14.140]  why not use SVG and make them resolution independent
[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.380]  as opposed to limiting them to 32 pixels or 64 or whatever.
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.140]  So that's my guess as to how that format came about.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.400]  And it wasn't, that it wasn't so much arrogance
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.000]  on their part that we can just force the web
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.100]  to adopt a format that we specify,
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.840]  but that internally to get the feature approved,
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:32.100]  it needed to be monochrome and if it needed to be monochrome,
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.520]  it needed to be a new format.
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:36.620]  Yep.
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:38.380]  Makes sense.
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:42.540]  So the question is, should Apple make this a feature
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.680]  or turn it on for everyone or make it an accessibility?
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.700]  I heard a lot of accessibility commentary
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:52.020]  that I kind of understand like the ability to discern,
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.100]  especially if you have lots of tabs,
[01:52:53.100 --> 01:52:55.060]  I don't do lots of tabs.
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.040]  So, and I totally get,
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.140]  there are some really damning screenshots
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.660]  of Safari with lots of tabs versus Chrome with lots of tabs.
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:05.860]  And you can pick out that tab of that site on Chrome
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:07.860]  and you have no idea on Safari.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.300]  And I think it's a strong argument.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.740]  Personally, I don't, I think when I wrote about it,
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.360]  I think the first thing I said was, I kind of don't care,
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.740]  but I'm trying to understand like why Apple
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.400]  has this attitude that it has.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.820]  And I think you're right, I think it is aesthetic.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:24.960]  And I think the Apple or the pin tab thing is,
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.820]  it shows that there are people inside Apple
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:30.240]  who are like, they don't want to touch those,
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.980]  those fat icons if they can help it.
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:35.700]  I mean, they're in your like bookmarks menu and stuff.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.420]  They do exist in a few places,
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.940]  but they're really de-emphasized.
[01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:43.180]  So obviously Apple wants to keep them at arm's length.
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:47.060]  I've really hoped that they do this.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:50.060]  I mean, I went so far as to write this article,
[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:52.660]  pushing for it, but I was just blown away
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:53.980]  from when I first brought this up
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:55.540]  as to how many people wrote to me
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.300]  and said that they're using Chrome because of this.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:00.740]  And they would love, they know about the battery life
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.660]  advantages of Safari and or they would love
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:09.660]  to take part of Safari's better integration with iCloud,
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:12.200]  like with the reading list that you can send articles
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.620]  from any other app, use the sharing sheet
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:15.780]  and send it to reading lists
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:17.820]  and then read them in Safari later.
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:21.500]  It just integrates better with an iCloud based lifestyle.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.420]  They would love to do it,
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:24.460]  but they have lots of tabs open all the time
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:26.260]  and they pick them out by favicon
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:28.220]  and therefore can't use Safari.
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:29.620]  Really just this one issue.
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.760]  And is that true or not?
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.580]  If 200 people wrote to me out of however many thousand
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.100]  people read the article and said that,
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.180]  is it really true that if Safari introduces favicons
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:42.980]  and tabs that these people would switch or give it a try?
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:44.280]  I mean, I can't prove that,
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.540]  but I got enough earnest emails from people
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:51.300]  that I honest to God believe that some measurable percentage
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.620]  of Mac users would switch from Chrome to Safari
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:58.420]  if Safari had favicons, at least as an option.
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.500]  And the option thing I think is key to it, like sure.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:02.860]  And I heard from some people who were like,
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:04.220]  oh my God, I don't want,
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:07.580]  I find those favicons to be so gross, I don't want them.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:10.460]  So fine, I'd say definitely make it an option.
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.660]  Maybe even make it off by default.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:16.220]  I mean, but just put a thing in the Safari view menu
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:18.580]  to show favicons and tabs.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.700]  And it would really have, I really mean it,
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.140]  a measurable effect on,
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.940]  maybe that measurable effect is 3%.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.140]  I don't know, but that's,
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.980]  I'll bet the people on the WebKit team and the Safari team
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.060]  would love to have those 3%.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:37.260]  If your life's work is working on Safari and WebKit,
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:41.300]  it would drive me nuts knowing that we're losing
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.380]  three, four, 5% of our potential Mac users
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:47.180]  simply because we're not permitted to put tabs in the,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.720]  favicons in the tabs.
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:50.560]  Yeah.
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:55.220]  I think it's not unreasonable to give people options.
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.460]  I can see the aesthetic arguments against it,
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:00.820]  but they could either invent a new format.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.540]  And I had somebody say to me,
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:04.300]  well, yeah, but most sites don't do that.
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.340]  It's like, well, yeah, I know most sites don't.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.860]  You'd have to have a generic thing just like pin tabs
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:12.220]  has a generic icon that comes up that if,
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.300]  it tries to make its best guess,
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:14.900]  it uses the letter of the website
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.020]  and then a dominant color on the page.
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.780]  And it says, okay, that's your icon now.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:22.900]  It's not perfect, but I'm a little surprised
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.860]  that they don't wanna do something other than,
[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:27.500]  I mean, maybe that's the answer is
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:30.020]  that even anything in there is considered junky
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.580]  and that there's some purity of the tabs.
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:33.580]  But if you look at the layout of like tabs in Safari,
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:34.940]  when you get a lot of tabs,
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:37.700]  Safari's tab logic is also a little questionable.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:41.540]  Like the Chrome tabs are much more kind of evenly spaced
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:44.740]  and logical and when Safari gets a lot of tabs,
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.580]  everything gets weird and mashed up and not great.
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:48.500]  And I think part of that is
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:49.740]  because they don't have favicons
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.020]  because what Safari does,
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:53.240]  what Chrome tries to do is actually very simple
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.980]  and it tries to keep all tabs the same width
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.740]  and just keeps making them smaller and smaller.
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:01.380]  And then as they get to this point where you can't read text
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.800]  just center them on the favicon.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:09.460]  What Safari does is keeps the ones that are left most
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.060]  and it depends on the size of your screen,
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:14.660]  but let's say like the left most 10 tabs, I don't know,
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:19.660]  just a basic number, equidistant or equisized.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:23.580]  And it's a size that's big enough
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:26.060]  that you can see at least the first few words
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:27.860]  of the title of the page.
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:30.540]  And then any additional tabs are on the left
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.320]  and they're really, really small
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.060]  to the point where you literally,
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.780]  they're only a few pixels wide and it's just sorta-
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780]  And then you have to scroll,
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:39.960]  you basically have to swipe left or right
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.900]  in order to move through the tab bar.
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.700]  And I think that they are kind of forced to do that
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.700]  because if they don't have favicons,
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:53.080]  the minimum usable width is a couple of words of text.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.860]  So I think Safari does a better job with lots and lots.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:57:59.940]  Like if you're the type of person
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:01.580]  who has 40 tabs in a window,
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.940]  I think the Safari design is better in that way.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.260]  In so far is that I think Chrome
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:08.720]  does something ridiculous with that,
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.000]  where they have all 40 tabs
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.260]  and you only see a fraction of the favicon.
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.400]  Like I think that to me,
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.720]  I think the ideal design would be something in between
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.140]  where they shrink to about a generous size
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:23.220]  that would accommodate the favicon and only the favicon.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.860]  But then after a certain point,
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:28.220]  even Chrome I think should start making them
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.560]  really tiny off the left
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:32.320]  so that there's only so many on screen.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.420]  What else was I gonna say about that?
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:39.580]  I had another point, but I think I've forgotten it.
[01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:41.340]  Anyway, I think they should do it.
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:43.100]  Oh, I know what it was.
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.260]  It was people who said, people who wrote in
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:46.840]  and said, you shouldn't have,
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.780]  nobody should have that many tabs open.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.620]  You should, I swear to God,
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:52.740]  I got a couple of emails like this
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:55.600]  that Safari's design is better
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.420]  because it prompts you not to have too many tabs open.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:01.740]  And I kind of get that.
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:03.920]  I do in some ways, user interface design
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:06.660]  should sort of encourage good behavior,
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:09.780]  but that's too prescriptive.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:13.660]  It's more important for UI to accommodate
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:15.020]  what people actually do
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:20.020]  rather than to be designed for an ideal use case scenario.
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.620]  Yeah, the fact is people, there are people,
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.500]  not all people,
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:28.340]  but there are people who are very tab dominated.
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:32.300]  And even if you don't think that they should be, they are.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.380]  That's just how it is.
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:37.420]  It reminds me of, in web design,
[01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:40.680]  there was always this idea of search dominant users
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.540]  and nav dominant users,
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:46.020]  where like you can build the most beautiful nav bar
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.380]  at the top of your website.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:50.080]  But the fact is some percentage of you users
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:53.560]  are just looking for a box to type words in and search.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:56.080]  And there's nothing you can say, no, no, no,
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.160]  you're gonna get bad results.
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.620]  The best thing you're interested in sports,
[01:59:58.620 --> 01:59:59.660]  you should click on sports
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.820]  and you'll get the best headlines.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:02.620]  And they don't care.
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.980]  Like that's just,
[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:08.980]  and so at that point as a good UX person,
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.420]  you have to say,
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.540]  I need to make my search experience better
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:14.680]  because they're going to use it.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:17.900]  I can't stop them, so it better be good.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:20.380]  You have to be realistic
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:23.160]  and designed for how people behave,
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.660]  not how people should behave.
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.820]  Like secondarily would be steering them
[02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.100]  towards the better behavior.
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:30.620]  But primarily you have to,
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:34.820]  your first obligation is to design for how people use it.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:36.460]  And the truth is there's an awful lot of people
[02:00:36.460 --> 02:00:39.380]  who use their browser in a way that tabs aren't usable
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:41.960]  unless they have five icons.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:42.800]  End of story.
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:46.160]  All right, let's go as a speed zone
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:47.120]  through the next three topics.
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:49.340]  Project Titan, New York Times had a story yesterday
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.220]  by Daisuke Wasabi, forget this.
[02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:54.040]  Wakabayashi.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.100]  Wakabayashi with an update on Apple's Project Titan,
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:00:59.700]  which is their car project,
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:01.420]  which sort of was coming from the angle
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:04.580]  of Apple had these bold plans to make a car
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:05.900]  and now they've scaled it back
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.260]  and now they're just making self-driving autonomous software
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:14.320]  and maybe the technology, the sensors and stuff for that.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:17.340]  But also had the intriguing tidbit
[02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:20.340]  that they're seemingly on the cusp of launching a shuttle
[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.940]  that will just rotate between their Bay Area campuses,
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:25.980]  like between the new campus and Infinite Loop
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.340]  and maybe a few other stops in Palo Alto area
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.140]  where they have office buildings,
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:34.700]  which these shuttles will be self-driving and autonomous
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:37.880]  and they'll be on the road and that's pretty interesting.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:42.500]  Yeah, I heard something about how
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:47.500]  in the separate fufa about Apple building a campus
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.380]  in a suburb where there's not a lot of public transport
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:52.140]  access and whether that's good or bad
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:54.180]  versus Amazon building in downtown Seattle
[02:01:54.180 --> 02:01:58.060]  and lots of different perspectives there.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:59.520]  I have some opinions, but I also think
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.320]  there's some reasonable opinions across the spectrum.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.300]  What I hadn't really thought was,
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:06.140]  well, one of the ways that you get
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.820]  public transportation use up
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:11.100]  is build your own public transportation system
[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:12.860]  and this felt a little bit like that.
[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:17.140]  Like if you have autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles,
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:18.760]  not just those Apple buses that are coming
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.660]  from San Francisco to take people to Cupertino,
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:24.460]  but like moving between different campuses
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:27.920]  and also moving to different train stations
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.020]  and things like that.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.060]  I hadn't really thought about that,
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:32.020]  but that would be a very interesting application
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:34.540]  of this technology that would give Apple a lot of data
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:37.100]  on a very limited set of streets, right?
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.520]  Where they could get really great data
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.100]  about the streets in these small cities in the South Bay
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:46.540]  and do it there on that finite number of roads.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:48.600]  So it's a really interesting idea.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.820]  Yeah, and the article states that there were sort of
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:55.320]  two mindsets within Apple at the outset of this
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.540]  and one was to have sort of a regular car
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:59.780]  with self-driving autonomous features,
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:04.420]  more of a traditional car with a regular driving
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:05.660]  steering wheel and stuff.
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:10.640]  And then a more ambitious vision that apparently,
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.660]  according to the article, was endorsed by Johnny Ive
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:17.860]  to totally reinvent the car and go fully autonomous only.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:22.460]  And so there's sort of a negative,
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:25.740]  to me there was a very negative slant to the article
[02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:27.680]  in terms of it being, like I said,
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.980]  the gist of it seemed to be Apple had ambitious plans
[02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:32.460]  and now they've scaled back
[02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:34.700]  and are just building this autonomous system.
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:37.660]  Whereas I think a more interesting way to read this article,
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:38.700]  just the facts in the article,
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:42.220]  is that it's actually, the more ambitious plan
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.060]  seems to be the one they're pursuing.
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:47.540]  Like it seems like what they abandoned was the,
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:51.940]  let's just make sort of like a Tesla with the autopilot
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:54.400]  and that the fully autonomous car,
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.960]  which obviously would take years longer to hit the road,
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:00.260]  it still seems to me what they're building towards.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:01.740]  Like, I don't think the idea
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:04.500]  that they're going to produce their own car hardware,
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.100]  it sounds funny to call it car hardware,
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:09.700]  but to actually make the cars,
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:12.060]  I don't think that's off the table at all.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:14.820]  And in fact, I can't imagine,
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:18.100]  I know a lot of people seemingly in a couple of podcasts
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:20.020]  I've listened to over the last year or so
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:24.420]  as this whole Bob Mansfield reboot of Project Titan
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.580]  and they're just building the autonomous system.
[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:29.900]  I just can't fathom that if they're successful
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:32.240]  and build an autonomous driving system,
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:35.340]  that they would license it to existing car makers.
[02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.660]  That's just not Apple.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:39.040]  That would be, I would find that shocking.
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.880]  I really would.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:41.540]  I don't even think it's on the,
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.660]  again, I have no inside information on this.
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:45.120]  Like strategic information like that
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.240]  just exists only at the highest levels and doesn't leak.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.180]  I just think that,
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:50.700]  I don't even think it was even discussed.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:52.420]  I'd be shocked if that was actually,
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:55.120]  like we can go to Ford or BMW or somebody
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.840]  and license the Apple self-driving technology.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.020]  I think if they get to that point, they're making a car.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.660]  Yeah, I think,
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:07.460]  I read that section of this article as being more about,
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:10.860]  it actually reminded me of like old bad Apple
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.200]  back when they would come up with these amazing things
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.380]  that would never be a product.
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:17.180]  And I felt like the way I read it was that Mansfield
[02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:18.820]  was applying some focus.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.660]  Yes.
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.180]  To a project that lacked focus.
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.460]  Because the fact is, if you say,
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:26.380]  hey, we have maybe an unlimited budget.
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:27.980]  We have this incredibly rich company.
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:29.340]  It's got so much cash.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.500]  Let's reinvent the car.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:33.380]  And then what they end up doing is like,
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:37.280]  let's design a door and let's design an interior
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:39.100]  without a steering wheel or gas pedals.
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.620]  And let's investigate whether we can literally,
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.700]  not a metaphor, reinvent the wheel
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:45.580]  by using a spherical wheel
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:49.260]  instead of a traditional radial car wheel.
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:51.980]  And I've read that as being like,
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:54.440]  Bob Mansfield came in and said, okay, stop.
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.640]  The core of what we're gonna do is autonomous driving.
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.620]  Everything else is a distraction.
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:00.700]  Let's get this right.
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.860]  And then if we get this right, we'll put it in a car.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.700]  Right.
[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:04.520]  Let's not reinvent the entire car.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.660]  Let's see what we'll do.
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.580]  If we get this right, let's see what we'll do.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.820]  And it reminds me a lot, I'm not the first person,
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:11.500]  I'm probably the thousandth person
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.180]  to make this direct analogy,
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:14.940]  but it sounds exactly like what Apple did
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:16.240]  with touch screen technology,
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.520]  where Apple had people working on touch screen technology
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:23.460]  for I think 10 years before the iPhone came out.
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:27.920]  And not specifically, famously,
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.220]  the basic thought was, well,
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:31.780]  some kind of tablet type thing.
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:33.300]  So it wasn't even a phone project,
[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:37.100]  but rather than bite off,
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.220]  like let's create the iPad from scratch,
[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:41.900]  it was let's just see what we can do with touch screens
[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:44.340]  and then see what we can do from there.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.900]  And I think you're exactly right,
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.260]  that Mansfield's focus is,
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.140]  let's make a working autonomous system
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.980]  and then see what we can do from there,
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:53.820]  as opposed to-
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:54.660]  Yeah, right.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:56.580]  It looks like designers,
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:59.660]  and the article suggests Jonathan Ive himself, right,
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:00.620]  is very much into,
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.660]  oh, we could completely reimagine the car.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.780]  And that at some point it's like, well, let's stop, stop.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:07.860]  Let's go back to what we're really good at
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:10.500]  and get really good at that and see where it leads us,
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.380]  rather than trying to reinvent
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:14.340]  every single aspect of this car.
[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:16.060]  I also think there was a,
[02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:18.340]  we talked about this on Upgrade a while ago,
[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:21.380]  and then somebody pointed me to an episode of a podcast
[02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:24.100]  that's about, basically it's about Tesla,
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:26.700]  but that episode was about the Apple car.
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:28.940]  And one of the things that they suggested
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:30.420]  that I thought was really brilliant,
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:31.660]  and it really changed my mind
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:33.300]  about where Apple might go to this,
[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:37.340]  is the concept that Apple might not sell a car.
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:39.620]  Apple might, in the long run,
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:42.140]  be thinking about doing a car service.
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:43.300]  And the idea there is,
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.940]  you sign up as a member of this car service,
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:47.820]  and when you need a ride,
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:51.020]  you call and an autonomous car comes.
[02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:52.780]  But the cars are all owned by Apple
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:54.380]  and they're maintained by Apple.
[02:07:54.380 --> 02:07:56.060]  And so Apple doesn't need dealerships.
[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:58.100]  Apple doesn't need to sell a car.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:00.860]  Apple just creates the Apple car service
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:02.100]  of self-driving cars,
[02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:04.420]  which is where Uber is going to.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:07.060]  And what I like about that idea
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:10.220]  is that I have a hard time seeing one Apple licensing,
[02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:11.060]  as you said,
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:13.940]  this technology to just regular old car makers.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:15.620]  Oh, our car comes with Apple.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:17.860]  Way, yay, nobody cares.
[02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:21.220]  And I also can't see Apple really buying a car maker
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.260]  or maybe making,
[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:26.300]  the closest I could come is making a strategic investment
[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:31.140]  in a car maker and having them build their car for them.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.900]  But even then, are they going to sell it?
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.020]  Is Apple going to sell it?
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:37.300]  Is Apple going to build a network of showrooms?
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:41.660]  But if it's a service and nobody ever buys an Apple car,
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:45.500]  then at that moment, I thought, oh, I could see that.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:46.540]  I could see Apple doing that.
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.260]  Cause you can roll it out in specific regions
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:49.500]  and specific cities.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:52.340]  You can do a slow rollout and learn as you go and build.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:55.060]  And at no point do you have to support
[02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:58.500]  and maintain somebody's purchased vehicle
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.860]  because it's a fleet and they all belong to you.
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:03.460]  And you don't know what car is going to get you
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:04.380]  when you press the button.
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:06.180]  You just know that a car is going to come pick you up
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.860]  or pick your kid up and take them to school or wherever.
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:11.340]  And it's going to be an Apple car and it's going to be nice.
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:12.980]  And it's going to integrate with,
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:13.820]  as soon as you get in,
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:15.100]  it'll pick up something from your iPhone
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.420]  and it'll have your music and...
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.700]  Exactly.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:19.540]  I could see that.
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:20.740]  That makes more sense to me.
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:21.580]  Yeah.
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:22.420]  I don't know.
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:24.100]  I still think,
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:26.140]  and the other thing that was interesting about the article
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:31.140]  is the article definitely definitively said that,
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:34.300]  yes, they let go of some hardware people
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:36.700]  on the Bob Mansfield reboot,
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:39.260]  but they've hired back a lot of people.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:40.660]  So it's still a big project.
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.860]  That's the thing I take away from it,
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:45.860]  is that however big you thought Project Titan was before,
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:48.540]  it is still a very large initiative within the company,
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.820]  which to me is very exciting.
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:51.660]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:52.500]  Cause there's something there, right?
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.340]  I mean, cars in,
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:54.660]  what I've always been saying about cars
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:56.380]  since this first rumor happened was,
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.940]  cars in 20 years are not going to be anything like cars
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:01.980]  of now or 20 years ago or 50 years ago.
[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:04.620]  Like we are on the cusp of some pretty dramatic changes
[02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:07.780]  with the computer technology, with electric drivetrains,
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:09.140]  cars are going to change.
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:14.140]  The run of the classic like automobile for a century plus,
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:16.180]  I think is coming to an end
[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:17.900]  to be replaced with something that's different.
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:19.900]  We're gonna have a good time telling our grandchildren
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.700]  about what cars are like.
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:23.820]  You had to put gas in them
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:25.460]  and you had to drive them yourself
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:30.140]  and you bought one for like 30,000, $50,000.
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:32.260]  It's huge amounts of money more than you'd spend.
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:34.420]  You had to take out a loan in order to get them.
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:38.300]  40 to 50,000 people a year died on the roads
[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:42.540]  in car accidents in the United States alone every year.
[02:10:42.540 --> 02:10:43.380]  And we just-
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:44.620]  People would just fall asleep at the wheel
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:46.060]  and the car would crash.
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.020]  Can you believe that?
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:48.780]  Cause that doesn't happen anymore, right?
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:51.820]  Now that the computers do all the driving and you owned,
[02:10:51.820 --> 02:10:54.340]  I mean, I really do believe it could be you owned a car.
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.180]  Right.
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:57.980]  And can you believe those days when you owned a car
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.500]  and well, what did it do when you weren't driving it?
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:03.580]  It just sat in a parking lot or a garage somewhere
[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:04.620]  and didn't do anything.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:06.540]  Well, that sounds crazy and wasteful.
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.380]  Yes.
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.420]  Wouldn't you get bored while driving
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:10.700]  and want to look at other things and devices
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:12.020]  and say, oh yeah, people did that.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.380]  And then they would just drive right in,
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:15.780]  drive right in the car.
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.740]  Those fatalities we were talking about earlier,
[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:19.060]  that's where they came from.
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.900]  Oh yeah, people got bored and looked at their,
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:21.900]  we used to call them phones.
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:24.420]  People used to look at their phones.
[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:25.700]  Before they were right in your eye.
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.380]  Then they, yeah.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.900]  And so if I'm Apple and I've got,
[02:11:28.900 --> 02:11:30.420]  this is my standard line on this is like,
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:33.460]  if I'm Apple and I've got billions of dollars in cash
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:35.420]  and I know that this industry is going to change
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.820]  and I know that technology is going to drive it,
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:40.460]  why would I, that is such an easy bet to make.
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:42.220]  And it doesn't mean it's a sure thing.
[02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.740]  And it doesn't mean it's easy to do it.
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:46.100]  But like, if I'm Apple and I'm in the position Apple is
[02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:49.580]  with the money that it's got and the resources that it has,
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:53.580]  you would be, I would say that like, as a stockholder,
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:55.340]  if I was a stockholder, which I'm not,
[02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:58.180]  I would be like, you have a responsibility
[02:11:58.180 --> 02:12:00.100]  to take a shot at the car market,
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.660]  because it's right, it may be right up your alley
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.980]  and it could completely change.
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:06.620]  So now's the time to get into it.
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.500]  So I think it's great that they're doing it
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:09.620]  no matter what happens.
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:11.620]  And I think that it's a very good bet
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:15.060]  that however the car world looks in 20 years
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:20.060]  or 30 years, whatever, in large parts of the world,
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.820]  and especially in the United States,
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:24.060]  there's a need for something like a car,
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.900]  a vehicle that goes on roads,
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:28.660]  because it's just the country is too sparse and big.
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:31.500]  And for someone like me who lives in the middle
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:34.620]  of a big city, I can see cars getting off the roads
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:35.460]  in big cities.
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.620]  I can imagine that future very easily
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:39.380]  and being replaced by other things.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:43.940]  But for, in general, will there be things like cars
[02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:45.220]  on the road and a need for them?
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.060]  Absolutely.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:48.220]  And Bay Area is a perfect example.
[02:12:48.220 --> 02:12:50.860]  Like I just can't imagine how the Bay Area
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:52.180]  isn't gonna have cars.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:54.180]  It's just, it's...
[02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:57.180]  Yeah, and if they're efficient,
[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:59.700]  I mean, then you're using freeway space
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.300]  to move people around.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.620]  And it's already there for a lot cheaper
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.100]  than building new trains.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:06.740]  When you watch the computer simulations
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:07.940]  of what self-driving cars,
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:09.460]  how efficient they could be on a freeway,
[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:10.340]  it's remarkable.
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:11.540]  It could turn the entire freeway
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:16.540]  into effectively a train-like density of people.
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:20.700]  Anyway, I came around from this article
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:25.700]  being excited for Project Titan, not despondent.
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:28.220]  One last quick one before I take the last break
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:31.180]  is iMessage is an unheralded social networking Goliath.
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:34.540]  There was an article I linked to on During Fireball
[02:13:34.540 --> 02:13:38.660]  making the case that iMessage is the number one
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:41.020]  social platform for teenagers in the United States.
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:44.220]  And yes, it's stronger among teenagers.
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:46.300]  And yes, it is a US-centric thing.
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:48.340]  And around the world, like especially in Asia,
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.020]  there are other independent services
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:54.460]  that are cross-platform like your WeChat
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:56.900]  and your WhatsApp and what have you
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:57.900]  that are more popular.
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:13:59.980]  And iMessage isn't really even relevant
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:01.180]  in some of those countries.
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:05.300]  But here in the US, iMessage is super, super dominant.
[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.860]  And I've been banging this drum for a while
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:10.060]  that it is completely and utterly overlooked
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:11.620]  by most of the business and tech press
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:15.700]  as a huge social networking win for Apple.
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:20.700]  I'm curious, your kids, are they on iMessage?
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.180]  Yeah, so my son doesn't use his phone a lot,
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:26.580]  but when he does, he is sending iMessages to his friends.
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:27.500]  That's absolutely the case.
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:29.180]  I'm on his iPad too.
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:31.740]  My daughter, Snapchat is the number one.
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.420]  Snapchat still has it.
[02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:38.420]  She does use iMessage, but it's,
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:43.460]  I think it's more utilitarian when she uses iMessage.
[02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:46.300]  Like literally, I need to send you a text right now.
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:50.540]  But for all of the more social, fun, conversational stuff,
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.380]  it's basically all Snapchat.
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:57.140]  Yeah, Giuseppe Stuto is the guy who wrote this article.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:59.740]  I'll try to remember to put a link in the show notes.
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:03.140]  It's super strong among my friends.
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:06.100]  My son's 13.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.780]  And again, he's, it's probably extraordinarily different,
[02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:11.380]  especially at that age among boys and girls.
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:14.340]  But you know, like when his friends are coordinating,
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:16.620]  like a, hey, let's all get on PlayStation
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:17.620]  and play a certain game,
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.940]  the coordination all takes place on iMessage.
[02:15:19.940 --> 02:15:22.500]  Yes, yes, that's true with my son's friends too.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.540]  A little less with my daughter.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:25.220]  Although again, that's the utilitarian part,
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:27.340]  which I think gets mixed up in this story a little bit.
[02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:30.980]  I suspect just as having observed a 15 and a 13 year old
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:35.260]  at close range, that I think iMessage is calling it,
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:38.140]  like, it feels a little less social.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:40.660]  It is a little social, but like for my daughter,
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:44.620]  the really fun social is split off into Snapchat.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:48.500]  But you know, they do both use it the same way we use it,
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:51.860]  which is to say, yeah, we're gonna play this video game.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:53.140]  Let's get on, you know,
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:54.820]  let's get on and play Overwatch or whatever.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:57.060]  And my son and his friends do that all the time.
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:00.460]  So I actually feel bad and I actually acknowledge,
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:02.380]  and again, this is just, you know,
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:05.260]  the way people do behave and the way people should behave.
[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:08.340]  I agree that in an ideal world,
[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:12.580]  the defacto messaging platform would be universal
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:14.940]  and cross-platform, you know, the way email is,
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.300]  the way SMS is, I mean, SMS sucks in a bunch of ways,
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.660]  but at least it didn't matter if you were on Verizon
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:23.540]  or AT&T, you could still text each other.
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:26.620]  And so I actually think in a way,
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:28.740]  I don't say this as like, you know,
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.140]  wow, this is great for the world, it's good for Apple,
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:34.620]  but I think it sucks that a kid who, you know,
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:35.940]  and I think an awful lot of kids
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.420]  get like a hand-me-down phone.
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:41.820]  And if, you know, if your dad's last phone was an Android
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.780]  and that's the phone you get,
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:47.220]  I think it sucks that you're out of your group chat,
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:49.900]  the group chats of your friends that are on iMessage.
[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:50.860]  I think that sucks.
[02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:53.940]  I mean, I'm not saying that Apple is morally obligated
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:55.900]  to do iMessage for Android.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:58.620]  And I totally understand the strategic value
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:00.740]  of keeping it a competitive advantage.
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:03.740]  And if there is some sort of peer pressure to get iPhones
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:06.180]  because your friends are using group chats on it,
[02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:10.020]  but just as a dad who remembers what it was like
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:12.820]  to feel left out at certain times as a teenager,
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:14.540]  I think that sucks, right?
[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:16.220]  It's, you know, but it's the way it is.
[02:17:16.220 --> 02:17:19.180]  And I think to deny that it's a huge factor
[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:21.860]  in U.S. teen culture today is,
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:23.900]  you're just being willfully ignorant.
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:26.980]  Yeah, and it's probably used as a tool
[02:17:26.980 --> 02:17:29.180]  to ostracize people who don't have iPhones, right?
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:30.020]  Of course, right.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:33.340]  If we're being honest about the way teenagers work, right.
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:35.700]  I could just search Google or Twitter someday,
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:38.620]  just pause the podcast and go search for green bubbles
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.460]  and you'll find adults,
[02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:44.140]  you'll find adults complaining about how gross it is
[02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:47.260]  to text somebody from their iPhone and see green bubbles.
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:48.980]  It's, you know, it is a thing.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:50.500]  Anyway, I will take a break right here
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:55.140]  and thank our fourth and final sponsor of this episode.
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.940]  And it is our good friends at Fracture.
[02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:58.660]  Fracture is the photo decor company
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:00.420]  that is out to rescue your favorite images
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:01.540]  from the digital ether.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:03.180]  Don't let your photos just, I mean,
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:04.740]  post them to Instagram, sure.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:07.260]  But that's, you know, it scrolls away
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:09.020]  and then nobody comes back to them, right?
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:11.380]  That's not how you keep mementos.
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:13.460]  Take your best photos,
[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.780]  find your best photos a couple of times a year
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:19.900]  and go to Fracture and get them printed directly on glass.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:21.300]  It's the most amazing thing.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:23.900]  I know they're a frequent sponsor of the show too.
[02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:25.900]  You've probably heard me talk about them before,
[02:18:25.900 --> 02:18:28.820]  but if you don't have one, words are,
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:30.140]  it's difficult for me to find words
[02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:35.020]  to really describe how amazing a Fracture print is
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:38.620]  compared to a traditional print that's on paper
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:41.260]  and then put in a frame behind glass.
[02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:44.700]  Like printing the photo on glass really is like,
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:46.860]  it's even more to me striking,
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:49.620]  but similar to the difference from when iPhone switched
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:53.900]  from being an LCD screen behind a piece of glass
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:55.860]  to being, you know, with an air gap
[02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:00.300]  to being fused directly onto the glass with the iPhone 4.
[02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:02.420]  And, you know, tilt the viewing angle
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:04.500]  and it looks like it's right there on the surface.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:05.940]  It's amazing.
[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:09.420]  What a great product and what a great gift idea.
[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:12.980]  It's such a great gift idea for anybody in your family
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:16.780]  to just print some photos of your kids or whatever,
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:19.540]  your dog and give them out.
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:21.740]  Everybody loves to get one of these.
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:24.620]  They are, each one is handmade in Gainesville, Florida
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:26.180]  from US source materials.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:30.980]  And the thing comes with everything you need
[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:33.660]  to hang it up on the wall or prop it up on your desk.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.620]  Really, it's just one of my favorite companies
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:37.460]  and my favorite products in the world.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.820]  And I don't know anybody else who does anything like this.
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:43.020]  I don't even know if they have any competition, really.
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:45.580]  It's just a remarkably unique company
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:47.060]  with a terrific product.
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:49.180]  You can get more information and save 10% off

[02:19:57.420 --> 02:20:00.260]  And then you can mention the talk show
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.380]  in their one question survey at the end
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:03.260]  when you place an order.
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:06.300]  And that one question is where'd you hear about Fracture?
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:07.540]  So my thanks to Fracture.
[02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:10.380]  All right, we're running long.
[02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:13.340]  I have a few things I wanna talk about though.
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.300]  Okay.
[02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:16.540]  You recently, I just linked to it today actually,
[02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:17.540]  but you posted from a,
[02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.940]  you went on an 11 day road trip with your family.
[02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:21.820]  I did?
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:24.980]  Your notes from the road trip crystallized
[02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:28.100]  like some vague thoughts that have been running in my head
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:32.140]  as to how things are changing.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:36.700]  One of them was a segment and that's the part I quoted
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:38.700]  was a wifi versus cellular.
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:40.820]  And that you guys stayed in a couple of houses,
[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.700]  rental houses and hotels,
[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.420]  and that some of the houses had advertised,
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:46.540]  hey, we've got wifi in the house and that sounds great.
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:50.380]  And then you got there and like the one was backed by DSL.
[02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:51.940]  Like I remember when DSL first came out
[02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:54.860]  and DSL coming from a modem to DSL was like,
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:20:57.180]  wow, this is like real internet.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:02.180]  And DSL now feels like it's closer to like modem speed.
[02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:03.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:07.540]  That was like, DSL was the days when like,
[02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:10.420]  it was like cool that you could download music
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:11.860]  over the internet, like video.
[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:15.220]  No, you can't download video, let alone stream it.
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.180]  Like you look back, it makes you look back
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:21.580]  and we talked about the 15 year anniversary
[02:21:21.580 --> 02:21:23.180]  of Daring Fireball, like 15 years ago,
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:26.300]  the idea that you could download high quality HD video
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:30.940]  fast enough to watch it as it comes was ridiculous.
[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:34.540]  And so like you said, like on your trip,
[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.820]  like you guys burned through a big chunk
[02:21:36.820 --> 02:21:38.740]  of your monthly cellular allotment.
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:41.820]  That's exactly what happens to us whenever we travel now
[02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:42.660]  for the exact same reason.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:45.620]  Yeah, and it was rough because we're, I mean, it was good.
[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:47.500]  We're on one of the new AT&T plans now
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:49.500]  where they, when you hit your limit,
[02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:50.940]  and it's a much higher limit than it used to be,
[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:55.180]  but we hit it and they don't just charge you $15
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:56.500]  for another little block,
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:58.980]  which we would have gone through like $75
[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:01.340]  if that had happened, $100.
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:04.820]  The problem is that it limits your speed per device
[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:06.820]  to like 128K.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:07.660]  Oh, man.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:09.460]  And that was brutal.
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:10.300]  That was really brutal.
[02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:12.500]  It kind of worked, but it was really awful.
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:15.660]  And what frustrated me is for the vacation,
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:18.540]  what I wanted to do was call up AT&T and say,
[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:23.540]  can I give you $50 just to be unlimited this month?
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:25.260]  And then we'll go back to our plan,
[02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:27.140]  but they kind of don't want to do that.
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:30.100]  So I just kind of, and if they do, somebody let me know,
[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:32.460]  but I found that they don't make that easy
[02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:34.580]  at the very least in doing it that way.
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:36.660]  The iPad makes that possible.
[02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:38.340]  Like if you have an iPad cellular plan,
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:41.420]  you can burn through it and then just renew, you know,
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:42.420]  like, so Amy did that.
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.100]  Amy's a huge, huge iPad user
[02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:47.300]  and she's on AT&T on their iPad, on her iPad.
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:49.500]  And in the midst of traveling,
[02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:51.700]  and again, in a rental house earlier,
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:53.260]  it was exactly the same situation.
[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:54.620]  You know, the wifi was just,
[02:22:54.620 --> 02:22:56.980]  it literally just went out randomly, you know,
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:59.340]  like it was slow when it was on and it went out.
[02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:02.940]  And so she just used cellular and burned through her month,
[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:05.140]  you know, I don't know, in a week and a half
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:08.540]  and just paid another 50 bucks to get another month,
[02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:09.380]  you know, and all of a sudden-
[02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:10.980]  Yeah, if I had to do it all over again,
[02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:13.100]  I would have brought my T-Mobile SIM with me
[02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:16.260]  and pop that into my iPad and just bought a pass
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:19.340]  for, you know, for the month with a lot more data
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.660]  and just said, okay, we're using, you know,
[02:23:20.660 --> 02:23:21.860]  we're using this now.
[02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:24.460]  Because that's what happened is in the DSL place,
[02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:25.940]  which also had the spotty wifi,
[02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:28.660]  I would just have to unplug and replug the router,
[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:30.900]  the DSL router that had wifi every so often
[02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:32.580]  because it just stopped working
[02:23:32.580 --> 02:23:34.260]  until I unplugged and replugged.
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:38.580]  And there I was using cellular and we all were,
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:40.860]  and that was great, except that then we got to,
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:42.660]  by the time we got to Salt Lake City,
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:44.940]  we were over our cap and it was over.
[02:23:44.940 --> 02:23:47.620]  And the hotel we stayed in was surprisingly,
[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:48.580]  not all hotels are good,
[02:23:48.580 --> 02:23:51.420]  but the hotel we stayed in had good internet.
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.420]  It was really nice.
[02:23:52.420 --> 02:23:55.380]  But then we went to another rental and it was the same deal.
[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:59.060]  They had cable internet, but it was spotty,
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.540]  but it was better than what we had before.
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:03.620]  And we were out of cellular data.
[02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:04.980]  Oh, well.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:06.580]  You mentioned long cables.
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:10.180]  I had packing, keeping like a six foot,
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:12.860]  two six foot cables in your like travel bag
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.060]  is such a key kip because it's amazing
[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:19.300]  how many times you end up in a hotel room where like,
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:21.140]  oh yeah, there's a socket right next
[02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:21.980]  to this side of the bed.
[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:23.100]  And then the other side of the bed,
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:25.540]  there's nothing anywhere.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.660]  Yep.
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:29.060]  Yeah, and the long cables also comes,
[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:30.420]  I mean, I bought them originally
[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:34.020]  because my kids kept destroying lightning cables.
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:35.500]  And I discovered that my daughter
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.220]  was like holding her phone at completely taught
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:40.820]  while plugged into the wall
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:44.180]  because of where the cable was and where the plug was.
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:47.860]  And so I said, and my son did something similar
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:49.460]  with his iPad and I was like, all right, here we go.
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:54.100]  These are nylon braided, six foot long, use these.
[02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:56.380]  And it's been better, I would say.
[02:24:56.380 --> 02:24:58.500]  I think they still will probably destroy them,
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:59.500]  but it would take them longer.
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:03.260]  And it has this added benefit of in the car,
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:06.180]  our power plug is on the dash
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:08.580]  and I've got one of those dual USB things,
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:11.620]  but to get to the kids in the back seat, it's too far.
[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:13.100]  But with the six foot ones.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:14.660]  Not have the people in the front seat
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:17.180]  have a cord right by their neck.
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:18.660]  Right, exactly right.
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:21.340]  Yeah, just ready to snag you and knock you down.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:23.740]  So that worked great because I said,
[02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:24.900]  everybody bring your long cables
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:26.340]  and we plugged them in and that was great.
[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:27.700]  And then the other thing that blew me away
[02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:31.940]  is we made a stop in Nevada out in the middle of nowhere
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:35.580]  at a Flying J truck stop, I believe is what it was.
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:36.500]  Or maybe it's a pilot,
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.860]  but it was a truck stop on I-80 in middle of nowhere, Nevada.
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:41.780]  Somewhere, maybe Elko,
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:43.740]  I don't think it was as big as Elko.
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:46.140]  I think it was somewhere between Winnemucca and Elko.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:49.380]  If anybody was driven that, there's nothing out there.
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:52.740]  We love Nevada, but the parts of Nevada are very barren.
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:56.820]  And we get to the truck stop and I fill up the car
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:58.620]  and everybody takes a bathroom break.
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:01.420]  And since everybody else was doing that
[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:02.540]  while I was filling up the car,
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:03.700]  everybody's getting in the car and I say,
[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:04.860]  okay, I'll be right back.
[02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:05.700]  I go in there.
[02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:09.220]  And we got my son a Nintendo Switch for his birthday,
[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:12.020]  which was on this trip, except that the Nintendo,
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:13.220]  because it's Nintendo,
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:16.980]  the power plug that comes with it is USB-C,
[02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:18.420]  but it doesn't detach.
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:21.540]  It's just a plug on one side and a USB-C plug on the other.
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:24.240]  So you can't use it in a car.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.740]  And I come out of the bathroom and I'm staring,
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:30.140]  and they have like two giant displays,
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:33.680]  like on a wall of cords.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:36.060]  And so many of them, first off, are lightning,
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:40.340]  which really, I think the mind share of Apple products
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:41.540]  is so dramatic.
[02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:44.220]  Like 80% of the cords were lightning cords.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:46.960]  Right, which is bizarre because everybody keeps saying
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.500]  that even in the US,
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:52.160]  iPhone is like 20% markets there or something like that.
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:53.640]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.660]  And it's like, how can this be?
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:56.500]  It's very strange.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:58.540]  I know, it doesn't make sense to me.
[02:26:58.540 --> 02:27:01.340]  I mean, they did have mini and micro USB and they had USB-C.
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:03.140]  So if you're somebody who's got an Android phone
[02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:04.740]  and you want to plug it in, you can do that.
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:08.060]  And I was amazed because I was looking for a USB-C
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:12.040]  to USB-A cord for the Nintendo Switch
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:14.660]  so my son could keep playing it while we were driving.
[02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:16.220]  And not only did I find one,
[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:21.220]  I found a six foot nylon braided USB-C to USB-A cord.
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:24.980]  So I came out of the truck stop convenience store
[02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:27.100]  and just handed my son the box and said, here you go.
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:29.460]  Now you can play, even though his battery was dead,
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:30.300]  now you can play.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:31.900]  And I think he couldn't, I think he could play,
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.840]  but not charge because there's a weird power things
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:35.980]  about Nintendo stuff,
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:37.340]  which I think is why it comes with a plug.
[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:38.700]  But it just was a funny moment
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:40.140]  that we're out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:42.740]  And not only is there a wall of cable adapters
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:45.080]  in this truck stop right next to the Slurpee machine
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:47.020]  or the whatever, the IC machine,
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:48.780]  and next to the racks of beef jerky
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:50.180]  and everything else you find in a,
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:52.620]  and slot machines because it's Nevada.
[02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:55.100]  And then there are these, and all these cords,
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:56.500]  most of them lightning.
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.380]  I bought a cord at the beginning of the summer.
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:27:59.500]  And I'm so glad I did,
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:02.740]  is I've got a couple of micro USB things to charge.
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.080]  Most important of which to me
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:06.220]  is the like a portable battery charger,
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:08.340]  something I can put in my pocket and charge stuff.
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:10.940]  But they always charge from micro USB.
[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:13.120]  But I always have my kindle in the backpack
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.540]  and there's just, there's a couple of things.
[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:17.460]  And so I hate having the two cables.
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:18.620]  I got this thing from Belkin.
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:20.060]  It was ungodly expensive.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:22.340]  I think it was like $30, might've been more,
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:23.860]  but it's six feet long.
[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:26.700]  And it's a lightning cable with,
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:28.220]  at the end of the lightning cable,
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:32.260]  there's a little like a cap that you put over.
[02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:36.540]  That's a female lightning port that has micro USB out.
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:37.380]  Oh yeah.
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:39.560]  So you can't lose it cause it's attached.
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.700]  And so if you pop it on, it's micro,
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:44.600]  or I think if you pop it on, it's lightning.
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:46.500]  Yeah, with it on it's lightning
[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:48.900]  and you take it off and it's micro USB.
[02:28:48.900 --> 02:28:51.300]  And so you can have one cable that can charge both.
[02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:53.000]  And it is so great.
[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:56.580]  It's one of my favorite additions to my backpack
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:57.760]  in a long time.
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:58.600]  But the downside of that-
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:01.420]  I had one of those and it died in like two months
[02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:03.380]  and I just gave up and I said, all right, this isn't for me.
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.620]  It didn't last.
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:05.980]  I loved it when I had it.
[02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:08.300]  Well, so far so good with mine.
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:10.960]  But the downside to it is that now I still,
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:13.980]  it's only, it hasn't really gotten me from two cables to one
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:15.980]  because now I need a USB-C cable too,
[02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:19.580]  because I've got enough USB-C things like the switch,
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:23.340]  that like the complete eradication of micro USB
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:24.980]  cannot come soon enough.
[02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:28.420]  So I still have, I had to bring a mini USB with me too,
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:31.500]  because I brought my portable audio recorder
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:33.760]  to do one podcast from the road.
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:35.300]  I only did one podcast while I was gone
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.200]  and it was about the solar eclipse,
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:39.340]  which was why we took the trip.
[02:29:39.340 --> 02:29:40.940]  So it was a good reason to bring it.
[02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:43.840]  But that one, if you don't run it off of battery,
[02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.060]  it's micro USB.
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:48.760]  So I had to have a micro USB and a mini USB for the Kindles
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  and a USB-C it turns out for the switch plus lightning,
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:53.280]  which is, it's ridiculous.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:55.680]  This is why USB-C needs to be a thing
[02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:57.740]  because all this other stuff needs to go away.
[02:29:57.740 --> 02:29:58.680]  It's ridiculous.
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:00.220]  Yeah.
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:02.340]  So that leads us to the solar eclipse.
[02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:05.380]  So that you guys took a family road trip up to Idaho.
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:06.220]  Where'd you go?
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:07.860]  Idaho, yeah, Idaho.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:10.220]  And you got the full total solar eclipse.
[02:30:10.220 --> 02:30:11.480]  I didn't even think about it.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.780]  I honestly, it just, it never really occurred to me.
[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:18.220]  And now reading your stuff and reading Jason Kotke's posts
[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:22.260]  about seeing it, it seems like I was kind of a fool
[02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:24.460]  not to at least think about driving to Tennessee
[02:30:24.460 --> 02:30:25.860]  or something from here.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:29.020]  I got good news for you.
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:33.620]  There's another one in 2024
[02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:37.080]  and it will pass through Western Pennsylvania
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:39.860]  and Buffalo, New York and other places
[02:30:39.860 --> 02:30:41.260]  not too far away from you.
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:44.020]  So it'll be a little closer for you further for me.
[02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:45.680]  And if we want to travel Austin, Texas,
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:47.580]  which is a beautiful town.
[02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:49.780]  Oh yeah, you can go to Mazatlan, Mexico too.
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:51.940]  If you really want to do it right, you can go there.
[02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:52.760]  They'll have it too.
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.600]  All right, speed zone,
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:56.100]  because I'm really running out of time here.
[02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:58.200]  Letterman's going to have a Netflix series.
[02:30:59.100 --> 02:30:59.940]  Yay.
[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:03.920]  You know, and he cited to, in some interview he did,
[02:31:03.920 --> 02:31:05.820]  he cited Jerry Seinfeld's thing and even said like,
[02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:07.580]  I wish I could just do Jerry Seinfeld's thing.
[02:31:07.580 --> 02:31:09.580]  And when he retired, that's what I thought is
[02:31:09.580 --> 02:31:11.220]  he's going to do a Seinfeld thing.
[02:31:11.220 --> 02:31:13.220]  Something that is exactly what he wants
[02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:14.940]  and only as much as he wants, right?
[02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:15.820]  And then no more.
[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:17.780]  And I'm so happy because I was really worried
[02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:19.540]  that he was going to be like Johnny Carson
[02:31:19.540 --> 02:31:22.500]  and just go away and never do anything.
[02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:25.060]  And did you see his National Geographic thing
[02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:26.460]  that he did when he went to India?
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:27.500]  Yeah, it was remarkable.
[02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:29.140]  It was pretty good, right?
[02:31:29.140 --> 02:31:30.660]  So I, and I kept thinking, you know,
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:32.820]  this is the thing is, you know,
[02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:34.340]  find some people to produce it for him.
[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:35.760]  He knows what he's going to want to do.
[02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.900]  And they, and so in this case,
[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:40.460]  he's going to get six episodes, I guess,
[02:31:40.460 --> 02:31:42.340]  next year on Netflix to do this.
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:44.280]  And we'll see where it goes from there.
[02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:46.780]  But I think it's great to have him.
[02:31:46.780 --> 02:31:48.980]  And also, I think it's, I mean, his joke,
[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:52.020]  that you and I both quoted, which is, which is, you know,
[02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:53.540]  ask your family before you retire
[02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:55.500]  to spend more time with your family.
[02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:56.340]  So here's a question for you.
[02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.380]  Do you think he keeps the beard or not?
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:31:59.220]  I think so.
[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:00.980]  I think I saw him in an interview say,
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:03.020]  like, I never, you know, I'm tired.
[02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:04.300]  I'm done with shaving regularly.
[02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:05.980]  So I think, plus if you think about it,
[02:32:05.980 --> 02:32:08.060]  he's probably going to record this in an unusual way
[02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:09.980]  over a longer stretch of time.
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:11.340]  Having like beard,
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:14.500]  like maybe there's a beard continuity issue,
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:16.420]  but I think like keeping it just as the bushy beard
[02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:17.980]  and it's just bushy beard letterman.
[02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:19.180]  I think that's his thing now.
[02:32:19.180 --> 02:32:21.100]  I think it's just going to be beard, el beardo.
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:24.460]  That's like what post talk show letterman looks like.
[02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:25.300]  Yeah.
[02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:28.300]  But hooray, yeah.
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:31.300]  Basically yay is the answer for you and me both
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:33.500]  to just more of him, you know,
[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:35.580]  talking to people he wants to talk to and doing,
[02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:37.900]  it sounds like also like doing some maybe
[02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:39.580]  man on the street stuff again,
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.180]  which is very interesting to me.
[02:32:41.180 --> 02:32:43.580]  Like he seems to have an idea for what he wants to do.
[02:32:43.580 --> 02:32:45.900]  And so, yeah, I can't wait.
[02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:47.020]  Yeah, I can't wait either.
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:48.700]  I think it's going to be great.
[02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:51.180]  And I think it'd be interesting to see him,
[02:32:51.180 --> 02:32:54.740]  he see him play in the Netflix area
[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:56.620]  where he doesn't need to worry about commercial breaks
[02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:59.300]  because he's always been a master of form.
[02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:03.460]  And I think he could do something interesting with that.
[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.300]  Yeah.
[02:33:05.460 --> 02:33:09.020]  And then last but not least on my list at least is,
[02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:12.380]  and again, sort of related as a fellow talk show geek,
[02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:14.900]  Jerry Lewis died a couple of days ago.
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:17.020]  And I want to throw in here, you know,
[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:19.220]  like when we do audible reads and throw in
[02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:20.580]  like a recommendation of a book,
[02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:22.820]  I want to throw in a recommendation for a movie to watch,
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:25.660]  which is Martin Scorsese's, The King of Comedy,
[02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:29.700]  which by talking about the basic plot
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:30.820]  doesn't really spoil anything,
[02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:33.140]  but it's the gist of it is that Jerry Lewis
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:37.220]  plays a very Johnny Carson-esque late night talk show host
[02:33:37.220 --> 02:33:39.180]  who lives in New York,
[02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:42.340]  who gets kidnapped by a character played by Robert De Niro,
[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:45.220]  who's a very hard to describe,
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:49.340]  sort of a kook who wants to be a comedian.
[02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:52.580]  And it is a very,
[02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:55.140]  the vibe of the movie is very hard to explain
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:56.980]  because there's moments when you're watching it
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:34:00.260]  where you're thinking it's devolving into farce,
[02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:05.260]  but it never leaves a sort of realistic take.
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:11.900]  And it was a commercial failure when it came out in 1983,
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:13.940]  but it's one of those movies
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:16.060]  that has become like a cult favorite.
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:19.780]  And Jerry Lewis is just amazing.
[02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:21.780]  I'm presuming here that you've seen it.
[02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:25.980]  I haven't seen it since I was in like high school.
[02:34:25.980 --> 02:34:28.580]  So I have basically no memories
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:30.380]  other than like the broad outlines of it.
[02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:31.620]  I should probably revisit it
[02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:34.020]  since I like most of Scorsese's work,
[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:35.220]  especially from this period.
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.900]  I haven't watched it recently.
[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:39.420]  So I'm looking forward to it.
[02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:40.620]  Like it's, you know, and it's, you know,
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:42.860]  it's a shame that it takes a guy dying for me
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:45.060]  to think I should watch a movie.
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:49.340]  But I've watched it recently enough that it,
[02:34:50.540 --> 02:34:52.460]  I always thought, I remember the first time I saw it,
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:54.020]  I thought this is a fun movie.
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:34:56.460]  How come nobody knows about this movie?
[02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:58.060]  But watching it like semi recently,
[02:34:58.060 --> 02:34:59.740]  like, I don't know, maybe like 10 years ago,
[02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:04.100]  is it's absolutely astounding how comfortable
[02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:08.300]  and like to be that Johnny Carson-esque character,
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:10.060]  like part of what made Carson Carson
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:14.300]  was that it was like a well-worn shoe for our culture.
[02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:16.060]  You know, like your favorite pair of slippers.
[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:18.740]  It's just like every night when his show came on
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:20.820]  or whenever Carson would appear anywhere,
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:22.260]  like if he hosted the Oscars or whatever,
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:23.700]  it's like, ah, there's Johnny Carson.
[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:27.140]  And you knew exactly what he was and who he was.
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.700]  It's just remarkable how Jerry Lewis,
[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:33.340]  it feels like he had, you know,
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:36.820]  somehow it felt like I was totally comfortable
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:39.100]  with the fact that he was a guy who was on TV
[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:41.660]  for an hour a night every night for the last 20 years,
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:43.660]  even though he, you know, wasn't.
[02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:46.500]  It's, and you could almost see how in another world,
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.780]  Jerry Lewis, the real Jerry Lewis might've been
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:52.140]  like a host of The Tonight Show or something like that.
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:52.980]  It's-
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:54.860]  It's really weird casting.
[02:35:54.860 --> 02:35:56.940]  And I think brilliant casting in the way of like,
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:00.020]  you need somebody who feels like they are this iconic
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:01.620]  larger than life figure.
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:03.300]  And Jerry Lewis fit the bill, right?
[02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:05.820]  Even though he wasn't a talk show host,
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:09.660]  it was close enough that that was a great pick.
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.860]  Like, cause if it was somebody random,
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:14.140]  then it wouldn't have the same impact.
[02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:14.980]  Right.
[02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:18.020]  Like how, you know, Gary Shandling doing Larry Sanders,
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:19.780]  I mean, he guest hosted The Tonight Show
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:20.700]  for many, many years.
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:25.260]  And it was a close enough fit that it made sense in a way
[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:27.900]  that some random casting would not have worked.
[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:28.740]  Right.
[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:32.660]  It's exactly it, is there's a rare sort of
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:37.660]  onscreen personality that is believable
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:40.060]  as a nightly talk show host.
[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:42.900]  And somehow Jerry Lewis totally pulled it off,
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:46.060]  even though in real life, he was really the opposite,
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:49.300]  which is like the consummate talk show guest to come out
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:54.060]  and be manic and crazy as the guest
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:55.900]  in front of the straight man host.
[02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:58.580]  And then he could just turn that inside out
[02:36:58.580 --> 02:36:59.660]  and play the host.
[02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:01.180]  And it's, it's really a great movie.
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:02.420]  I highly recommend it.
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:05.180]  That's my pick of the week for, for those of you out there.
[02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:06.020]  All right.
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:09.420]  Anything else, Jason?
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:11.820]  I don't think so.
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:14.980]  Boy, if there's, we didn't talk about sports, let's not,
[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:17.140]  but we'll say that for the next time.
[02:37:17.140 --> 02:37:18.780]  Save it for next season for you.
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:21.140]  Oh, at least.
[02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:26.500]  Anyway, everybody can find Jason's fine work
[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:31.500]  at sixcolors.com, is that right?
[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:32.340]  Is that right?
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:34.860]  I just, I just know, I just get to the S I X
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:38.060]  and it fills in and you could spell.
[02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.060]  I wanted a.com, it had to be a.com.
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:41.260]  I wasn't going to settle for less.
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:42.500]  Those of you on the other side of the pond
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:46.060]  can spell colors any way you wish and it'll still work.
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:49.340]  Your podcasts, you can find them,
[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:52.500]  a bunch of them at the incomparable upgrade
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:54.860]  is over there with the great Mike Hurley.
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:57.300]  At relay FM, yeah.
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.540]  Relay FM.
[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:01.260]  And what else is there?
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:04.820]  There are many, I mean, basically six colors
[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:06.980]  will get you my writing and the incomparable.com
[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:08.780]  will get you my pop culture podcasting
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:11.820]  and relay FM will get you my tech podcasting
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:15.140]  along with space and some other stuff.
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:17.300]  And it's all great and I really appreciate it.
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:18.900]  You and Mike have been doing a great job this summer.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:22.060]  I've been, it's one of my favorite shows, it really is.
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:23.700]  Thank you, it's a lot of fun to do.
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:25.540]  It's weird, you and I have had this conversation.
[02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:28.340]  It's weird to think that we're as much podcasters
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:33.220]  as writers in our careers, but upgrade is a lot of fun.
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:34.660]  And that is sort of the,
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.100]  I'd say that's the incomparable upgrade
[02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.820]  and six colors are the things that I do
[02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:41.340]  if I was telling somebody what I do.
[02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:42.260]  So I'm glad you like it.
[02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:44.700]  Yeah, and it's not to start a whole nother segment here,
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:46.380]  but I like listening to Mike
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:49.740]  and I like listening to CGP Grey too.
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:54.740]  I really like listening to the iPad enthusiasts,
[02:38:54.940 --> 02:38:56.540]  the people who really love the iPad.
[02:38:56.540 --> 02:39:00.020]  This is what a summer it's been to hear them
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.820]  think about where iOS 11 is going
[02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:02.780]  because it's been so great.
[02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:04.780]  And I love it because I'm not,
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:08.300]  I appreciate the iPad and I like it,
[02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:13.300]  but I'm so staunchly stuck on the Mac mentally.
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:17.060]  I was blown away by your thing from the road trip, right?
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:19.700]  That I didn't take a Mac with me
[02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:20.900]  for 11 days out on the road.
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:23.380]  That was, I made that decision.
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:25.500]  And I noticed that your note on Daring Fireball
[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:30.220]  was gives you the heebie jeebies that you can think about it.
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:31.700]  I would just feel like I was walking around with that,
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:33.140]  like that nightmare you have
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.180]  where you forgot to put your pants on
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:35.020]  before you went to school.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:36.580]  That's how I would feel every moment of the day.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:38.860]  I'd be like, oh my God, what if I need a Mac?
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:42.820]  So anyway, it's been great listening
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:44.500]  to your show over the summer.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:48.140]  It's great times to be talking to someone with an iPad.
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:52.980]  Enthusiasm, my thanks to you.
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:56.220]  What a great, how generous you are with your time.
[02:39:56.220 --> 02:39:59.140]  By my clock, we've been on for four hours.
[02:39:59.140 --> 02:40:01.340]  Yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.
[02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:31.300]  Metric time.
