[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  All right, The Last Jedi. I don't think we ever talked, I don't think I ever had an episode about Rogue One.
[00:05.360 --> 00:14.960]  So I guess we could, we should focus on The Last Jedi, I think. But if we sneak in some Rogue One, I think that's all right.
[00:14.960 --> 00:22.560]  Yeah, I'm all for that. Rogue One came out when the world exploded. So I don't think anybody was in the mood to talk about it.
[00:22.560 --> 00:28.000]  So at the highest level, what do you guys think of The Last Jedi? And I'll just say this, by the way, for the listeners of the show,
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.880]  if you haven't picked up already, this is going to be totally spoiler effect. This is an assumption that anybody who really cares about this right now,
[00:34.880 --> 00:39.440]  at the end of December 2017, you've already seen The Last Jedi, you want to hear about it.
[00:39.440 --> 00:51.120]  If not, and you don't care about spoilers, keep listening if you want to. But if you really want to see the movie without having listened to three nerds really get into nitty gritty details and spoil anything and everything that we want to,
[00:51.120 --> 01:00.880]  hit the pause button right now and save this podcast in your podcast player of choice until you see the movie. But shame on you for not having seen this movie already, honestly.
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.360]  All right, a disclaimer out of the way. What did you guys think of the movie overall?
[01:05.360 --> 01:18.800]  I loved it. How many times did you see it? Twice. I was trying to go see it again yesterday and today, but, you know, life gets in the way.
[01:18.800 --> 01:26.400]  I have problems with it. I have structural problems with it. But there's a reason I love it and I think we'll get into that after.
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.480]  But all in all, like such a positive feeling about this movie. It's not even funny.
[01:32.480 --> 01:44.240]  Some kind of middle of the road on this one. I've seen it twice. The reason I feel like I'm kind of on the outside here is the things I dislike about it are not the things that I hear other people dislike about it.
[01:44.240 --> 01:51.280]  Like there's a lot of noise from the people who don't like this movie, but whatever they're mad about is not what's causing me to be middle of the road.
[01:51.280 --> 02:00.480]  So I enjoyed watching it and it was definitely interesting. And it is one of the more interesting Star Wars movies in a long time to talk about.
[02:00.480 --> 02:16.560]  But I think I'm not entirely sure it gels as a movie and as a narrative for a bunch of reasons, most of which are minor and have nothing to do with Star Wars and everything to do with just basic movie making stuff.
[02:16.560 --> 02:28.320]  That's the thing. A lot of people are mad about this movie for Star Wars related reasons. And the things that made it not connect to me or not work with me in certain ways don't really have much to do with Star Wars.
[02:28.320 --> 02:43.520]  So I'm kind of middle of the road on it. I mean, I also know all those movies that I'm interested to see what it will be like when I see it again, like when it comes to video or whatever, because I found with Rogue One, speaking of that movie, that I saw that I think I saw it once in the theater, but I was surprised at how it changed when it came out in video and I watched it again.
[02:43.520 --> 02:56.320]  So I think it does help to get some distance from these movies. And to be clear, I liked Rogue One a little bit better when I saw it in video. So we'll see how Last Jedi turns out. But it's definitely a change of pace. And so it's intriguing.
[02:56.320 --> 03:26.240]  I had the same reaction to Rogue One where I kind of came out of Rogue One thinking, pretty good, you know, good enough that it's over the 50 yard line. I feel like it's a good movie and a good Star Wars movie. But a little yeah, a little, you know, not even sure why they made the movie like, and then watching it on home video. I was like, you know what, this is pretty damn good. This is better than I remember from the theater. And I don't know why that is. And it's always to me a good sign. It's a good sign for most movies. There's a very few movies that shouldn't be
[03:26.240 --> 03:40.000]  rewatchable. But I think it's essential for a Star Wars movie that gets it's part of the entire idea of a Star Wars movie is that you should be able to watch this over and lose track of how many times you've seen it over the years and still get into it.
[03:40.000 --> 04:07.920]  Yeah. And I think all these movies for people of our age, the problem with the first watch, maybe even on the second watch, if it's closely followed by that is there's a whole Star Wars part of our brain, like those those whole brain diagrams to show that, you know, people's brains are divided up into and they would show like the men's brains, the huge section of sports or whatever, which is probably true of John's brain. But in all of our brains, I think there is a big quadrant sectioned off for Star Wars because it informed so many things about it.
[04:07.920 --> 04:19.920]  So it's very difficult when watching a movie that is a Star Wars movie to like disengage that part and take the movie on its own merits, because at least on initial viewing, the Star Wars part is fully engaged.
[04:19.920 --> 04:33.920]  And it's like and especially it's like it's like PTSD from the prequels. Right. So it's like fight or flight response is constantly there. Like what's going to happen? Do we have to do we have to flee? Is it going to you know, and so it helps to relax.
[04:33.920 --> 04:55.920]  And I think I think the force awaken helped my brain to relax a little bit, because that was that was the real important one to get me out of like the dark times. Right. And I was able to be more relaxed with the last Jedi, but I still feel even on two viewings that I want to see all our time and video just to see if I can, you know, take it in its fullness without that preconceived notions.
[04:55.920 --> 05:17.920]  I almost I almost hesitate to presuppose and say what JJ Abrams was trying to do with the force awakens. But I feel in my gut that that what you just said was part of his goals for the force awakens was to sort of, here's two hours of this is going to be this trilogy is going to be okay.
[05:17.920 --> 05:40.920]  And I say this as perhaps in our gang of Star Wars nerds, the one who's the least critical of the prequel trilogy. Like I've certainly you know, we've talked about it on past Star Wars holiday spectaculars. There's obviously a lot of problems with it. And I feel though that amongst people of my generation, I'm one of the least critical of that trilogy of the people I know.
[05:40.920 --> 05:52.920]  Far be it for me to fight you for that dubious honor. But I was trying to get Snell to do the prequels, cover the prequels on the incomparable, but only have people say nice things about them.
[05:52.920 --> 06:17.920]  I wish he bailed on because that's impossible. But I like you, there's some things that are cool about them. And importantly, and this will come up later as we talk about why, while I agree with Syracuse about everything that he's about to say about moviemaking, I love this as a piece of art. I think it's great.
[06:17.920 --> 06:33.920]  But the prequels informed a lot of people like john was saying that, you know, we have a section of our brain carved out for Star Wars. Like it or not, there's a bunch of people who had the prequels carve out a similar section for them. Right.
[06:33.920 --> 06:40.920]  And this movie sort of tries to bring that together a little bit. And I appreciate it.
[06:40.920 --> 07:00.920]  Yeah, I think so. I for Mike, john, it's got to be true for your kids. But for Jonas, Jonas saw no distinction. But I've said this before, it's one of the things is that the Jonas really he loved Star Wars, he still loves Star Wars, but kids Mike, my son is about to turn 14, eighth grade.
[07:00.920 --> 07:24.920]  And his generation of friends all seem to like Star Wars, there's lots of toy lightsabers, and they all knew him. But the two trilogies, the two first two trilogies just all blur together for them. And, and they don't, there's no, they, they get it, you know, but they don't really see them as like two distinct entities, which is crazy to me, because they're so different in style.
[07:24.920 --> 07:53.920]  But the kids just don't. And to me, the best example exemplification of this is the, the Star Wars tours ride at Disney World, where you you're like, the gimmick of the ride is that you're going on some kind of consumer flight, and all of a sudden, you're you're taken away into part of the, you know, something bad happens and your consumer little shuttle is wrapped up in adventures, and you they randomize it.
[07:53.920 --> 08:13.920]  So you go through, it's like a flight simulator, like in a big bus type thing. And they have scenes from a whole bunch of movies, and you get like a random like first act and second act each time you go on. So the next time you go on, you probably will get two entirely different things. But they mix and match the first half and the second half.
[08:13.920 --> 08:26.920]  But what the way they do it drives me nuts as a Star Wars fan, because it's like the first half might be like on the the Wookie planet, what is it Kashyyyk, and you're you're in the Clone Wars in a Clone War battle.
[08:26.920 --> 08:47.920]  And then in the next one, you're in, you know, Endor in the other trilogy. It's like just by flying through a Hoth or something like that you're in Empire Strikes Back. It's crazy. How can you suddenly you're just jumped 30 years. It doesn't make any sense. But it makes sense to the kids.
[08:47.920 --> 09:00.920]  You should know it's not the same for my son because I didn't show my son the prequels. So he's free household here. Oh, that's right. I totally forgot about how can I forget that? You're a terrible father.
[09:00.920 --> 09:18.920]  He's a great father. And he does watch the Clone Wars TV series and Star Wars Rebels, both of which are better than the prequel. So he does understand that that timeline more or less. He still hasn't seen him. He still hasn't seen the prequels. I think he saw Revenge of the Sith at a sleepover party many years ago.
[09:18.920 --> 09:30.920]  And then I yanked him out of that. And no, no, he saw it. I mean, who knows? He might have fallen asleep during part of it. But that was that was several years ago. And I think he's seen bits and pieces of the other ones, like in YouTube clips and stuff. That's about it.
[09:30.920 --> 09:42.920]  I do love it. I love it where it's like in our family, the the debate was like, how old does he have to be before he can see the shining? The answer was whatever. Yeah.
[09:42.920 --> 10:03.920]  Yeah, like The Exorcist is about seven. So you can go from there. But I mean, the important part for me was to show my kids the real Star Wars movies over and over and over and over again before they ever knew the prequels existed. So they I imprinted them on real Star Wars and everything else is properly filed in their mind as expansion material.
[10:03.920 --> 10:12.920]  You know, I love that your training technique for your kids is identical to the clones, as we see in Attack of the Clones.
[10:12.920 --> 10:26.920]  They asked to see Star Wars. I didn't like that. They would ask me, you know, Daddy put in Return of the Jedi. You know, like, it's not like I was forcing them to watch it with the Ludovico technique to bring up more of John's favorite movies.
[10:26.920 --> 10:36.920]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at Fracture. You guys know Fracture. They make you give them your photos. They print them on glass. They ship them to you.
[10:36.920 --> 10:45.920]  They're fantastic gifts. Well, guess what? It's too late for the holidays. Now, I told you back in Thanksgiving that you needed to get your fractures in before Christmas because they get back ordered.
[10:45.920 --> 10:54.920]  But now that it's after Christmas, you've really got no chance of getting this in time for Christmas unless you like like the Star Tours vehicle, like you can somehow time travel.
[10:54.920 --> 11:03.920]  So forget about it. But keep them in mind for any future event, birthdays, Mother's Day, Father's Day, any kind of thing where you have to get a gift.
[11:03.920 --> 11:15.920]  I hate picking gifts for people and I'm bad at it, which might be why I hate doing it. And Fracture prints given to friends and family are the best gift.
[11:15.920 --> 11:27.920]  I've never once done it and not gotten an effusive response. And the best thing about it is you can keep doing it over and over and over again as long as you pick new photos to have printed.
[11:27.920 --> 11:39.920]  I mean, don't just print the same photo and expect them to appreciate a second copy of the same photo. Just, you know, if you've got kids, annual pictures of your kids and give them to all of the grandparents.
[11:39.920 --> 11:45.920]  And I'm telling you, you will be heralded as the best gift giver in the family. It is a fantastic product.
[11:45.920 --> 11:54.920]  It is an easy way to give great gifts. I really just keep in mind I it's changed my gift giving life for the better.
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.920]  I really can't say enough about them. Also, they're a green company right here in the US.
[11:58.920 --> 12:04.920]  They have a carbon neutral factory where they make these things down in beautiful Gainesville, Florida.
[12:04.920 --> 12:18.920]  So you can feel good about it in that way. Go to fracture dot me. That's our website. And if you remember this code, talk 15 ta lk like talk show 15 and you'll save 15 percent off your first fracture order.
[12:18.920 --> 12:24.920]  Get it. 15 for 15 percent. There you go. Don't forget to mention this podcast in our one question survey.
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.920]  And I'm pretty sure that one question is where did you hear about fracture? That's that's what it is.
[12:30.920 --> 12:35.920]  All right. So my thoughts, I like this movie a lot. I think I liked it better than The Force Awakens, but I'm not sure.
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.920]  I honestly feel like I almost have to. I walked out of the theater on the first viewing thinking I like this movie better than The Force Awakens.
[12:42.920 --> 12:49.920]  Now I'm thinking, I don't know, maybe I need to do the Syracuse thing and wait seven months for it to come out on home video.
[12:49.920 --> 12:54.920]  On the whole, I don't think it'll be seven months. I like for the record, I like Force Awakens much better than this.
[12:54.920 --> 13:02.920]  I've always been sure about it. I continue to be sure. We'll see. Maybe it'll change when I see it in video, but very solidly Force Awakens is head and shoulders above this for me.
[13:02.920 --> 13:11.920]  I really like I love The Force Awakens, too. But all of this talk after this one came out about sort of like stack ranking these things.
[13:11.920 --> 13:15.920]  I don't care. I just gave up. It's tough to stack rank them. I tried to do them, too.
[13:15.920 --> 13:20.920]  And I started to get fuzzy, you know, in the once you go below Empire Strikes Back.
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.920]  But, you know, like just two movies. Forget about all the other movies. Just these two movies, Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.
[13:26.920 --> 13:31.920]  Are they tied? I mean, you can pick a tie if you feel like you can't pick one or the other. But like, are they close?
[13:31.920 --> 13:39.920]  It's a thing and we will get into it. But as a movie, I believe The Force Awakens is a tighter, more concise and a better movie.
[13:39.920 --> 13:56.920]  As a sequel or as part of mythology, which I think we'll get into, I think that this serves a tremendous role that does a little bit of damage to it in terms of being a coherent movie, but serves the greater whole.
[13:56.920 --> 14:00.920]  I don't know. I know what you're saying, but I don't think those two things need to be connected.
[14:00.920 --> 14:10.920]  Right. Like, I don't think it's necessary to like if you're going to, you know, because this last I just changed things up and I get where you're coming from that you like that, but it doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice being a coherent narrative to do that.
[14:10.920 --> 14:20.920]  You don't have to like that. Maybe it's a higher degree of difficulty. But honestly, I think the degree of difficulty of The Force Awakens coming off the prequels and trying to balance all these different factors and introduce new characters.
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.920]  Well, you know, like it was a huge like the degree of difficulty with Force Awakens was tremendous.
[14:25.920 --> 14:33.920]  This movie was perhaps more ambitious, but I think the degree of difficulty at best is a tie between them.
[14:33.920 --> 14:44.920]  So I agree. And there's flaws with it. To be honest, I walked out being happy that we had Star Wars worth talking about again.
[14:44.920 --> 14:55.920]  And that meant a lot to me in a, you know, in a real childish way. And, you know, it tickled that section of my brain that came up on this stuff.
[14:55.920 --> 15:10.920]  Here's my question. And it's why I started by including a question of how you like to compare it to The Force Awakens is to me, the more important question is, does this feel like the second part of a trilogy, which I think is important to Star Wars?
[15:10.920 --> 15:23.920]  And I do feel that one of the strengths of the prequel trilogy is that those three movies all feel like they are of a piece, whether you like them or don't like them or feel mad about them.
[15:23.920 --> 15:30.920]  Those three movies feel like three parts of one long story that is meant to be told in three movies.
[15:30.920 --> 15:47.920]  And the first trilogy, the beloved original trilogy, I think does a great job of it, with the exception of the fact, the totally excusable exception of the fact that the first movie originally Star Wars, then retitled A New Hope, but I'll call it Star Wars till I die,
[15:47.920 --> 16:00.920]  was made in a way that if he never got to make another movie, you know, he in the back of his George Lucas's mind was I would love to make a trilogy out of this, I'd love to make a nine part thing out of this, but who knows if they'll ever let me near a budget like this again.
[16:00.920 --> 16:07.920]  So it has to stand on its own as a this is the only movie that's ever made in this thing.
[16:07.920 --> 16:16.920]  And I think even given that which is reasonable, and I thought very smart on his part, it still works as the first part of what feels like a three part movie.
[16:16.920 --> 16:30.920]  Yeah, this movie is weird because like, I get what you're saying, like, does it does this feel like, I guess I know what you're saying is does this feel like a natural follow up to The Force Awakens and I think a lot has been made of the director change.
[16:30.920 --> 16:40.920]  And like, you know, JJ set up all this stuff like the mysterious Snoke and wondering about who Ray's parents are and the dramatic handing of lightsaber between Ray and Luke, right?
[16:40.920 --> 16:50.920]  And it seemed like at every turn that Rian Johnson undercut that you were worried about lightsaber thing undercut with it with a gag, you're worried about Ray parents.
[16:50.920 --> 17:01.920]  We're going to tell you that that's not important. You're worried about Snoke sliced in half, right? It's just all like, it seemed like you could say there's disagreement about how this new trilogy is going to go.
[17:01.920 --> 17:12.920]  Maybe there is some of that, but I think that doesn't mean that it doesn't feel like it is a natural follow up. Part of what a sequel has to do, I think, is to subvert your expectations to some degree.
[17:12.920 --> 17:20.920]  And all the original Star Wars had different directors, right? Wasn't it was the looks to the first one, then Kirchner, then the French guy for Jedi.
[17:20.920 --> 17:34.920]  Richard Marquette. I can't remember any of the new character names. I can't remember any of the new character names. I remember. I mean, you name the obscure character. I remember Richard Marquette.
[17:34.920 --> 17:42.920]  Richard Marquette. We could go into that. It is sort of you look at like his IMDB or like you've never heard of any of his movies like Ervin Kirchner.
[17:42.920 --> 17:51.920]  You wouldn't think from his body of work that he'd direct a Star Wars movie, but he did direct some interesting movies like the one that hits closest to home for me is Never Say Never Again.
[17:51.920 --> 18:01.920]  The one and only non-Eon production James Bond movie where Sean Connery came back to the world, which is actually kind of a terrible movie, but I don't think it was Ervin Kirchner's fault.
[18:01.920 --> 18:15.920]  It was right around the same time, right? Like 82 kind of thing. No, it was 80. It was close. It was like 85. Okay, so it was after even Jedi. Okay. Yeah. No. Yes. Yes. Yeah.
[18:15.920 --> 18:20.920]  And you know, who knows? It is. It shows. It does show, though, that the three movies have different directors.
[18:20.920 --> 18:37.920]  Yeah, but what I'm getting at is like, so the original Star Wars had three different directors and very different movies, but they still feel like a trilogy. So here's two movies we've got so far with different directors and potentially one director having philosophical disagreements about how this trilogy should go and saying all those things, all those pins that you set up for me.
[18:37.920 --> 18:59.920]  I'm not just going to knock them down. I'm going to undercut them so that they appear comical or become unimportant or just essentially neutralized. But I think that's part of the tradition of sequels right down to one of my favorite sequel moments as a kid was realizing how clever it was to have The Empire Strikes Back open on a snow planet.
[18:59.920 --> 19:08.920]  This was in years before video games made this trope like hammered into our brains where you got the lava world, the water world, the snow world, so on and so forth.
[19:08.920 --> 19:19.920]  But like, you know, the whole thing of Star Wars was this desert planet. Right. And then they're in space. And right. And the second movie, you're like, I wonder what's going to be happening with Luke and his speeder and his X-wing and Death Star in space and the desert.
[19:19.920 --> 19:29.920]  And it's like snow, just snow, snow everywhere. Right. Maybe that wasn't undercutting. Sand and deserts wasn't set up as like the theme of Star Wars, but that's all we had.
[19:29.920 --> 19:39.920]  So I'm willing to give wide latitude to contrast with the movie that comes before in potentially surprising ways.
[19:39.920 --> 19:51.920]  But I do feel like there was so much undercutting that I'm wondering if the narrative is taking a turn. And this is made more interesting in this trilogy because J.J. is coming back for the third one.
[19:51.920 --> 19:59.920]  So he finally gets to have the last word. So this could be a swerve or J.J. could take this ball and run with it wherever they think this ball is going.
[19:59.920 --> 20:13.920]  But this is getting out with this being an interesting movie. If it didn't have that interest, if it just followed straight through from where The Force Awakens was headed, you could still make a great movie out of it.
[20:13.920 --> 20:23.920]  But we'd kind of start to see where it's going. Whereas The Last Jedi threw everything into chaos and it makes us have really no idea what's going to happen in the next movie.
[20:23.920 --> 20:27.920]  But didn't the Empire do that in the first trilogy?
[20:27.920 --> 20:35.920]  Yeah, kind of. I mean, they have the big dramatic revelation there, which is like, I didn't see that coming, even though his name means father in German.
[20:35.920 --> 20:44.920]  Well, it's not just that. I mean, we start with the rebels in a desolate, cold place where they're going to die after an immediate victory.
[20:44.920 --> 20:51.920]  Yeah, but they were getting medals at the end of the last movie. You can't go like, and now they polish their medals for the next movie? You got to put them back into peril.
[20:51.920 --> 21:07.920]  Look, I agree with you, but this subversion of expectations is what a good sequel does. And I think when we see Luke toss the lightsaber over his shoulder, what do you think Yoda would do if he was presented with the lightsaber he fought Palpatine with?
[21:07.920 --> 21:13.920]  He'd make some soup. He'd turn it into a cooking element.
[21:13.920 --> 21:30.920]  Turn it into a hot burner. I do think that's true. And in general, it's just as a general idea, people who care about movies tend to say, I mean, this has been true since they've made, I don't know what the first sequel was ever made to a Hollywood movie.
[21:30.920 --> 21:45.920]  But the general idea is sequels suck, right? That's just, you know, put a number two after a movie and everybody says, ah, it sucks. It's nowhere near as good as the original. And many sequels do suck. But that's only true because most movies suck.
[21:45.920 --> 21:58.920]  It's hard to make a good movie, and it's a lot easier to make a bad movie. But there's also one pattern that most bad sequels fall into, which is trying to recapture whatever it was that made the first movie great.
[21:58.920 --> 22:07.920]  So if there was battles in the first movie, there's battles in the second movie, but they're bigger. And if you had this character that people liked in the first movie, put that character even more in the second movie.
[22:07.920 --> 22:15.920]  Not bring anything new, but just taking everything that was in the first movie, bring it over to the new one and turn all the dials up. And that always makes for a bad sequel.
[22:15.920 --> 22:35.920]  But wait, I don't think Empire, nor this movie, did that, really. Yeah, and that's what I think Johnny's getting at. Yeah, I'm not saying that. I think that's why Empire stands up. Seriously, I've said this before, I will say it till the day I die, probably, unless some really fantastic movies come out in the next ten years.
[22:35.920 --> 22:53.920]  Is that it? Is that your timeline? Ten years? I was going to say 40 years, and I'm sitting here. Four-year lifespan. It's next to seven. Yeah, we're getting up there, but ten's pushing it, buddy. Oh, by the way, it dibs on fireball.org.
[22:53.920 --> 23:12.920]  You got it. One of my other beloved franchises, the James Bond series, effectively does exactly what I'm saying a good sequel doesn't do, which is here's a bad guy, he's got a lair, he's got an evil plot to take over the world.
[23:12.920 --> 23:24.920]  James Bond falls in love with a beautiful woman and gets the bad guy in the end and has a nice car at some point that he smashes into a million pieces halfway through the movie.
[23:24.920 --> 23:48.920]  I'm not sure it's really love, John, to be honest. The James Bond series, but it's not like it's James Bond 1, James Bond 2. It's almost like, to me, the James Bond series has sort of defined a genre of movie, and they just keep making movies in that genre, so it's not so much sequel-itis as, you know, there's just a James Bond movie-ness.
[23:48.920 --> 24:04.920]  Like the Daniel Craig ones, there's a little timeline, a little loop there, and arguably in some of the sequels, they tried to do what was good about Casino Royale, but more, and they'll hit the reset button, and then they'll get to do it again.
[24:04.920 --> 24:30.920]  Right, whereas the older ones with Connery and Bond, it doesn't matter what order you watch them in. There's really no rhyme or reason to it. There's the one stupid scene in the George Lazenby one where he's quitting the Secret Service and he opens his desk drawer, and there's mementos from all of the Sean Connery movies, but you know, the movie sucked.
[24:30.920 --> 24:46.920]  No, I think that Empire was part of what makes Empire my favorite Star Wars movie, one of my favorite movies of all time, period, and I just think a truly great movie. I really think it's so well-constructed, but part of it is that it didn't try to be like the first movie at all.
[24:46.920 --> 25:00.920]  It's just different in so many ways, and I think that's very true of The Last Jedi. I think that The Last Jedi plays on some things from previous Star Wars movies, but I can't really say that it was like any other Star Wars movie.
[25:00.920 --> 25:20.920]  I was handicapped by the fact that JJ kind of did a lead-in to the next movie, which as you noted before, Star Wars couldn't do, because who knew if there would even be a next movie, so you can't do that lead-in, right? Because when Star Wars ends, they get all their medals, blah blah blah, and Empire starts, we have no idea that Luke's going to go off to see someone named Yoda and be trained as a Jedi.
[25:20.920 --> 25:35.920]  There's nothing in the first movie that mentions Yoda or hints that he's going to go on. It's introduced to us in Empire. Ghost Ben comes and says, you must go to the Dagobah system, right? Whereas in The Force Awakens, we get that part before the movie ends.
[25:35.920 --> 25:56.920]  It's like, oh, Rey, you're going to go see Skywalker, here's the map, you're going to go there, and we get to see you go there, and you go there and you see him, and we see what it looks like, and you hand him a lightsaber, so we kind of know, like in the next movie, there's a thread you have to pick up. If they never showed that island in the next movie, this movie was somewhat undercut, and that thread at least has to go somewhere.
[25:56.920 --> 26:07.920]  We have to see Luke, we have to see Rey, they have to go somewhere. Empire got the luxury of saying, you don't even know from Yoda, Yoda's a thing, we haven't even thought of Yoda yet, but this movie's going to be a ton of Yoda in this movie and it's going to be super important, right?
[26:07.920 --> 26:21.920]  So that's not the fault of the last shot I had, but it does show that when they made The Force Awakens, they kind of knew there'd be another one. Pretty much nothing could have happened that would have prevented another one from being made, so it's structured differently.
[26:21.920 --> 26:37.920]  Yeah, so I've got two things about that. First, going back to the Bond thing, is A, they have a template to make a Bond movie, and they just keep doing it, and everyone is sort of retelling of the story, ghostly. And by ghost, I mean, I don't mean disgusting.
[26:37.920 --> 26:46.920]  I think they're iterating on the template, they're like three degrees into self-reflection, though, because again, the Daniel Craig Bond is all about reflecting on the old Bonds.
[26:46.920 --> 27:08.920]  Sure, yeah, exactly. And in a lot of ways, and this is where I'm bringing it back up, is I feel that The Force Awakens is the same thing for Star Wars. It is a retelling of a modern mythology. That's what I was saying two years ago on the show with Amy, who was besides herself. Has she ever gotten overhand dying? Is she okay?
[27:08.920 --> 27:30.920]  So, for those of you who don't recall, when The Force Awakens came out, we had the holiday spectacular. My wife Amy joined us on the show, and she really was just bereft. She had no idea. She went into this successfully. She didn't have to avoid spoilers. Her internet doesn't really have Star Wars spoilers, but went into it literally knowing nothing.
[27:30.920 --> 27:46.920]  I don't even know if she knew Harrison Ford and Han Solo were in the movie. And it's like, hey, there's the old gang, it's 30 years later, there's some stuff, and then bing, bang, boom, and the kid kills Han Solo. And she really was upset. And she was like, nobody told me.
[27:46.920 --> 27:50.920]  She said, Ben, why didn't you tell me?
[27:50.920 --> 28:06.920]  She was like, he's the only one in this whole stupid movie I liked, and they killed him. And she still hasn't seen Rogue One. She wouldn't go see it, because she said, I'm done with it. But she did. We drug her to see this movie, and she liked it and doesn't really want to see it again.
[28:06.920 --> 28:26.920]  All right, what about this? Before it escapes my mind, this is, to me, at a basic narrative level, maybe the most exceptional, and I mean exceptional in the way that it's an exception, like in programming terms, would raise an error.
[28:26.920 --> 28:46.920]  It's like outside the rules of Star Wars movies in the trilogy thing, where there's no gap between The Force Awakens and this movie. I mean, literally, her presenting the lightsaber to Luke when we've rejoined them, it's in the moment. It was obviously shot at the same time.
[28:46.920 --> 28:59.920]  I think this is what John was getting. It had to be, right? No, they did go back, because they saw some making up things. They did go back to the island, and they actually only had two days of shooting the island, and everything else was on the coast where the island is off of.
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.920]  I know they went back, but from a narrative perspective, it is the moment.
[29:04.920 --> 29:12.920]  I think at the time they filmed The Force Awakens, I'm not sure that things had been nailed down to the point where they knew Luke was supposed to chuck it over his shoulder.
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.920]  Well, no, I'm sure they did, but narratively, as we watch the movie...
[29:17.920 --> 29:28.920]  Yeah, they pick up that moment, and they didn't have to do that. They had to pick up that thread, as I said before, but they could have let us join the two of them in a hut somewhere, having a discussion. We didn't have to pick up from that moment.
[29:28.920 --> 29:40.920]  I find the scene where Luke takes his old lightsaber, his father's lightsaber, and throws it off a cliff nonchalantly to be one of the most powerful Star Wars moments we have.
[29:40.920 --> 29:53.920]  Mark Hamill has some problems with the treatment of Luke, and I have to say I kind of agree with Mark Hamill, but interestingly, I think I said this on The Incomparable,
[29:53.920 --> 30:05.920]  I think Luke in The Last Jedi, that character seems to me to be informed by the actual person, Mark Hamill, what little I know of him from seeing him do celebrity interviews as himself and not as the character Luke.
[30:05.920 --> 30:21.920]  The Luke in this movie seems very much to me like the actual Mark Hamill in real life, which is interesting that both I and Mark Hamill think it's not a great fit for the character, but because the gap is so long between the last time we saw Luke and now,
[30:21.920 --> 30:27.920]  anything could have happened in there that would explain this transformation, and they try to explain it in this movie.
[30:27.920 --> 30:42.920]  And John, two seconds, John. The one thing that we do have that we disagree about is that I have a different perspective upon Luke in Return of the Jedi than you do.
[30:42.920 --> 30:56.920]  I think he kind of went dark for a bit, and we have seen Jedi, including great ones like Yoda and Kenobi, just run away and hide for 30 years, and he's kind of following the same pattern.
[30:56.920 --> 31:03.920]  It's not the running away and hiding that I disagree with, and it's not the being tempted by the dark side I disagree with. The whole movies are all about him being tempted by the dark side.
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.920]  Empire and Jedi had Luke being tempted by the dark side and giving in to it to varying degrees at various points.
[31:08.920 --> 31:25.920]  But again, the time gap is so big that I'm not faulting the movie for this, I'm just saying that it was a surprise, which is fine, but it was also a surprise that it wasn't really adequately explained in the movie, which I think is one of the things Last Jedi has some problems with.
[31:25.920 --> 31:34.920]  They want there to be, you know, a bunch of stuff happening and here's where we are, and you're like, okay, I can see that happening, it's plausible, it's been 30 years, like tons of stuff can happen.
[31:34.920 --> 31:42.920]  It makes sense, but you have to put something on the screen to give me the Cliff Notes version of that, and they do that to greater or lesser degrees.
[31:42.920 --> 31:57.920]  And the character things that don't fit for me is the Luke I know from the original trilogy was a relentlessly earnest do-gooder who wanted to do the right thing but was also a little bit of a hothead, but in the end mastered his hotheadedness,
[31:57.920 --> 32:07.920]  resisted the dark side, refused to fight, and was triumphant in that endeavor, further reinforcing his earnestness, and presumably his hotheadedness would fade with age, and so on and so forth.
[32:07.920 --> 32:18.920]  Now, he could still have problems where he'd become, like as they say in this movie, you start believing your own hype, you know, you start believing in the legend of Luke Skywalker because everyone tells you you're super awesome, and like, oh, Luke Skywalker, you're great, you know, I bet you can do anything, right?
[32:18.920 --> 32:31.920]  That's their explanation in this movie, I just didn't see enough of it on the screen to really convince me that this, like, what I would have expected of Luke, sure he's in exile, sure he messed stuff up, I expected him to be more sad and less angry.
[32:31.920 --> 32:45.920]  Because, like, he learned through his arc in the first three movies was to chill out a little bit, to relax, to be more patient, and to understand, like, but don't I have to beat Darth Vader? Don't I have to hit him really hard with my sword?
[32:45.920 --> 32:57.920]  And that's how I'll win, and to get it through his thick skull, no, that's not how you win, you know, he chucks his lightsaber away, he says, I will not fight you, you know, I'm a Jedi like my father before, like, that's his arc, right?
[32:57.920 --> 33:24.920]  And he's such a do-gooder, and so earnest that, you know, I need to have an explanation of how he ends up in this place, because I would, sad and broken, totally see that, depressed, sad, broken, hiding, reclusive, turning inward, even shutting himself off from the forest, I totally see all of that, but kind of angry at the world, and bitter and stuff, seems more in keeping with cynical jaded Mark Hamill than it does with Luke.
[33:24.920 --> 33:34.920]  But all that said, I loved his character in this movie, I just have some difficulty connecting it back with 30 years ago, and again, there's 30 years worth of movies that we haven't seen there. So something could fill in those gaps, but
[33:34.920 --> 34:04.720]  we'll go let's go with Luke and what they did with Luke, because that was really good segment right there. And it's, it's a big part of the movie. And I think it's a huge part of the movie for us who, you know, grew up with that first trilogy, right? And, and it's a he it was a huge, huge, huge decision. And, you know, obviously, they knew exactly, I say missed opportunity, I want to say missed opportunity, but they knew what it meant that by not putting Luke in The Force Awakens, other than the
[34:04.720 --> 34:34.480]  the briefest moment at the very end of the movie, almost more as a, you know, here's what's coming in the next movie. We never got to see Han and Luke and Leia and Chewie together again. Right? The last time we saw them together, it was 1983 in Return of the Jedi, and they're never they're never going to be together again. And they could have, and it didn't have to be. And I get I totally get the idea that, hey, you're not going to make a $700 billion grossing movie starring 70
[34:34.720 --> 35:04.400]  year old actors, you know, you know, it's time for a new generation. But there's obviously 1000 different ways they could have written The Force Awakens, where Luke had some kind of role. And when you see, you know, you have that great scene with Han and Leia, and you changed your hair and and C3PO. And you might not recognize me, because he's got the red arm. You know, it could have been some Luke in there, too, right. And it was obviously a deliberate choice that we get the heartache that Luke has
[35:04.400 --> 35:34.160]  of never having seen Han again, right? I mean, that's the, you know, we don't get to see we don't get the joy of seeing them together again. And but then when he says, Where's Han in this movie? It hurts. It hurts because he could have seen him in the last movie before he died, even if they still killed Han. You know, so I get it, I get that choice. It works. There's a part of me that wants to wants to be angry at JJ Abrams for that. And there's a part of me that says I salute you for having the balls to do it because it really made it
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.880]  made Luke saying Where's Han in this movie, a moment that it to me is as good as any moment in any Star Wars.
[35:39.920 --> 36:00.480]  I totally agree. And I am really not one of the people that wants to get mad at a filmmaker for making the choices that you know, when it comes down to it, that's a film and this, that moment where he says Where's Han and they, they cut. We don't get there. Well, Han got killed by like, none of that. It's just
[36:00.480 --> 36:15.840]  and by the guy you see, and it just exactly. And it just hits you. And I know, oh, God, that's awful. I wish, I wish to be more Chewie and Luke hanging out. That's all. Yeah, I kind of would have liked to see.
[36:15.840 --> 36:31.040]  In this movie, though, like, there's a lot of characters in The Force Awakens, because you got to do the transition from old to new. And then they add even more here. And so there's just not enough time for Luke and Chewie to hang out. You barely got Luke to say two words to see Threepio. Yeah, I think Mark Hamill's
[36:31.040 --> 37:00.640]  comments on this, I think, are really interesting. And he's since walked them back and said he regrets it, because you know, and it's the reason that creative people just don't talk about the creative process. You could even say, this is why Apple doesn't explain itself is you start explaining yourself. And it just opens you up. You don't want to be too honest, like people don't want to see how the sausage is made. Right? People don't want to see it. But in a very honest interview, Mark Hamill said that he said to Ryan Johnson,
[37:01.600 --> 37:30.960]  Jedi don't give up. This is criticism of the way Luke was written in this movie, Jedi don't give up. I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup. But if he made a mistake, he would try to write that wrong. So right there, we had a fundamental difference. But it's not my story anymore. It's someone else's story. And Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective. That's the crux of my problem. Luke would never say that. I'm sorry. Well, in this version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars. This is the next generation of Star Wars. So I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he's
[37:30.960 --> 37:48.880]  Jake Skywalker. He's not my Luke Skywalker. But I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do, because it serves the story well. And he's since like two days ago, he had another thing where he said, You know what, I regret it. I love this movie. Ryan Johnson made a great Star Wars movie, and I'm happy to have been a part of it. Because it's taken out of context.
[37:48.880 --> 38:18.160]  It's taken a lot of heat. And I like honestly, as anybody who has made anything ever. I need like, I used to work on games. How many weird decisions get made when it's fine. It's not weird. I support the ability of him to say that this is the thing. I actually think Luke is wrong about the Jedi all of the Jedi that we know from the original trilogy, the only trilogy that Syracuse and knows things were wrong. They couldn't run. That's all we know.
[38:18.160 --> 38:48.080]  That's the only thing that Mark Hamill knows too. Mark Hamill has the same problem that the audience has that the last time he was Luke was Return of the Jedi. He didn't film a bunch of movies in the intervening 30 years where he got to play Luke at various stages. So the last Luke that he knows is the Return of the Jedi. And he's saying Jedi don't give up. But what he really means is, Luke, that character I played in those three movies, he was an Ernest Duker, who was a little hot headed and a little bit impulsive, but he was a Boy Scout. I mean, Luke was not, you know, like, you know,
[38:48.160 --> 39:18.040]  you see him in Empire Strikes Back of like, you know, what Leia says nobody cares. He says, I care. Like, he's just he's just trying to trying to get the girl trying to do the right thing, trying to beat the bad guy trying to leave his farm, like, and that's the last Luke that Mark Hamill knows. So when he sees how Luke is being played in this movie, he's like, I don't get how that character, the end of Return of the Jedi gets here. And Rian Johnson should have said, well, there's 30 years, a lot can happen in 30 years. And so he should have really sat down with him and said, here's what we imagine happened in 30 years, and here's
[39:18.040 --> 39:47.960]  how it would explain this transformation or whatever. But he's got the same problem we do. Like, how do I connect that Luke to that one? So maybe you could argue that that's a problem, like a director talking to the actor and understanding like, here's what your motivation is, let me tell you, like, your pretend backstory for the 30 years intervening or whatever, because this is what I want you to be in this movie. And like I said, I accept that. But when you have such a well known character, it's important to put things in the actual movie, that give you an plausible explanation of how they get to this point. And they tried really hard to do that with
[39:47.960 --> 40:15.680]  him explaining how he tried to train Kylo, how he started to believe his own hype, how he started to believe in the legend, how he saw the darkness within him. But it's like, yeah, but like the Luke who saw the darkness, would he take out his lightsaber and consider consider killing his sister's son? Like, maybe, maybe the Luke from 30 years, maybe he would do that. But like, what brought him to that point? Because the Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi, no way in hell would he do that. He wouldn't even fight his own father who was killing millions of people and gonna blow up all his friends.
[40:15.680 --> 40:45.440]  Yeah. And And by the way, so in Jedi, I do think that he's, he's progressed in his use of the force. But in Jedi, he's remarkably colder than he is in Empire and certainly in Star Wars. He's chilling out. I don't know if he's chilling out because he's strangling people with his brain. So that's probably not good. Well, he's distanced even when he's on the mission. He's like, I shouldn't come on the mission. But he still has this hot headed moment where, you know, if you won't join me, maybe your sister will and he gives in to his anger and fights. But that that's what that
[40:45.440 --> 40:58.160]  that's what convinces him when he finally sees like, you know, Yoda was right. I got it. Like, you know, only what you take with you like the cave, you know, remember the lesson in the cave, like he figures it out at the end. And by figuring it out, that's how he went. That's how the good guys win, essentially.
[40:58.160 --> 41:22.160]  I agree with you completely. But I can see the, if you take the transition for Luke from Star Wars to Empire to Return of the Jedi, and then sort of extrapolate that a long time, you can see him getting more and more disconnected from the world. And I find it a little bit believable that he would give up and pull the old Jedi thing.
[41:22.160 --> 41:30.160]  Like, you know what, everything screwed up. Now, here's what I totally agree with you. Pulling the laser sword on your nephew.
[41:30.160 --> 41:35.680]  And depressed and beating himself up all that, but probably like less sarcastic and cynical.
[41:36.400 --> 41:36.960]  Maybe.
[41:39.280 --> 41:44.160]  That is, I don't understand that. That's a long, long way to go.
[41:44.160 --> 41:55.160]  You guys, I assume, might know this. Jon, you probably certainly do. But you guys know that Lawrence Kasdan's, who co-wrote the screenplay for Empire Strikes Back. I forget if he had a writing.
[41:55.160 --> 42:08.160]  Yeah, he wrote. Yeah, what he, the way he, do you guys know the story of how he wanted Return of the Jedi to end? He wanted to die?
[42:08.160 --> 42:21.160]  No, it had nothing to do with Han dying. It had to do with Luke walking off into the sunset alone. Like in his, you know, he said like Clint Eastwood in one of the, you know, like westerns, spaghetti westerns.
[42:21.160 --> 42:30.160]  That he, you know, all these things can happen and he can redeem his father and they can kill the emperor and the rebels can have this great victory and blow up another Death Star.
[42:30.160 --> 42:38.160]  Like that Luke is isolated and he's, you know, there's no one else he can relate to and that the like the last shot of the movie would just be Luke walking off on his own.
[42:38.160 --> 42:41.160]  You know, how you get from there, you know, but instead of having like a celebration.
[42:41.160 --> 42:49.160]  That wouldn't work because all of Jedi is about him connecting with his sister and fighting for his friends. Like the unit's really, really cohesive unit. Like they're all working together as friends.
[42:49.160 --> 42:55.160]  They plan as friends. They execute as friends. He's worried about his friends out in space. So that would have to be a different script if you wanted to go in that direction.
[42:55.160 --> 43:03.160]  I've got a little bit of that moment when he's standing in front of the bonfire. He is isolated from everybody else.
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.160]  But he's still, he's smiling. He sees all his friends and his dead friends.
[43:07.160 --> 43:08.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:08.160 --> 43:13.160]  Right. It's like, it's like they, so they put a bit of that in with him alone in the bonfire.
[43:13.160 --> 43:21.160]  But they, you know, obviously it wasn't going to be the last moment, the most emotional cue of the moment, but of the movie and of the trilogy.
[43:21.160 --> 43:29.160]  But that's what Lawrence Kasdan wanted. But I think that that Lawrence Kasdan idea informed this Luke in exile idea.
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.160]  You know, whether that's where they got it or whether they thought of it.
[43:31.160 --> 43:36.160]  In exile I'm all for it. Like I expected him to be in exile. I expected him to be kind of like Obi Wan.
[43:36.160 --> 43:44.160]  Like kind of sad and depressed and sort of mad at yourself and just kind of like down and like the best I can do is hide.
[43:44.160 --> 43:53.160]  And like, like that you're hiding yourself as a dangerous weapon. Like Obi Wan definitely had that vibe where he was just, he was exiling himself because he had, he had colossally screwed up.
[43:53.160 --> 43:59.160]  And he's like, the best thing I can do is stay away. And he eventually was brought back in by the promise of redemption.
[43:59.160 --> 44:05.160]  But Luke is on this island just being pissed off all the time.
[44:05.160 --> 44:17.160]  I think it's interesting and Guy and I've talked about this privately, but I think it's interesting the way that old Luke that we see in this movie is way more Yoda than Obi Wan.
[44:17.160 --> 44:26.160]  Like you say Obi Wan is depressed. Obi Wan was obviously off on his own and, you know, he only got back involved when, you know, Leia came to get him.
[44:26.160 --> 44:34.160]  Like he wasn't like waiting, you know, he wasn't going to join. He, he had given up, you know, like exactly what Mark Hamill is saying that Jedi never do.
[44:34.160 --> 44:40.160]  Like Obi Wan had effectively given up and I guess the only thing he was doing was, you know, keeping some kind of force awareness.
[44:40.160 --> 44:45.160]  My head canon is that he's using Tinder and going down to the cantina.
[44:45.160 --> 44:48.160]  He's going to Mos Eisley.
[44:48.160 --> 44:52.160]  He's going to hide down the road from Luke. He's obviously looking over at Luke.
[44:52.160 --> 44:55.160]  And Kenobi, like Luke even knows that he exists.
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.160]  But he's not, but, but he and Yoda never decide to go after Vader and the Emperor.
[45:00.160 --> 45:07.160]  No, no, but once, you know, things come to a head, Obi Wan doesn't have, we don't get to see a moment of him saying, I don't know if I'm going to answer Leia's call.
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.160]  He pretty much is on board immediately with the message.
[45:09.160 --> 45:17.160]  Right. Whereas Yoda, you know, is the one who had the, you know, I'm not going to treat, I'm not going to do my Yoda here.
[45:17.160 --> 45:20.160]  Maybe I can, maybe if I have a little bit more of this scotch, I will, but.
[45:20.160 --> 45:24.160]  Take us away. Come on, man.
[45:24.160 --> 45:26.160]  Come on, you can do it.
[45:26.160 --> 45:32.160]  In the same way that Luke refuses to train Rey is exactly, it felt to me like the way Yoda was refusing to train Luke.
[45:32.160 --> 45:34.160]  Yoda was afraid. He is too old, yes, too old to begin the training.
[45:34.160 --> 45:40.160]  He was afraid because like, you know, Obi Wan has to convince him and Yoda's like, remember what happened last time.
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.160]  We ended up with Vader. That was a bad scene.
[45:42.160 --> 45:45.160]  That's why I'm on this, you know, Yoda does a eco retreat.
[45:45.160 --> 45:50.160]  He's like, I got to get it back to nature, back to like what the force is really all about.
[45:50.160 --> 45:52.160]  So does Luke though, right? And they've both got it done.
[45:52.160 --> 45:59.160]  Yeah, but Luke is feeling himself off from the force, but it's like, but just Luke is so kind of disillusioned and angry.
[45:59.160 --> 46:01.160]  Like Yoda is not disillusioned with the force.
[46:01.160 --> 46:05.160]  He retreats to a place with all this life to get closer to the force.
[46:05.160 --> 46:10.160]  He's not disillusioned, Yoda may be disillusioned with the bureaucracy of the Jedi council and blah, blah, blah.
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.160]  And how, and disillusioned with his own decisions and performance.
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.160]  Yeah, he's pissed off about the pink slip more than the actual.
[46:16.160 --> 46:19.160]  But Luke is like, I'm not even going to use the force.
[46:19.160 --> 46:22.160]  And part of that is hiding yourself, which I think is smart.
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.160]  But part of that is also that he's just like, F this force business.
[46:25.160 --> 46:27.160]  Like I'm not, I'm not down with that anymore.
[46:27.160 --> 46:34.160]  Like I just, you know, I'm just going to be on this island and I'm just going to close myself off entirely.
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.160]  Yoda is a great character and Luke is evolved into a great character.
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.160]  And so I'm not saying they're the same, but there's clearly way more Yoda in old Luke than old Ben.
[46:44.160 --> 46:50.160]  And it just like, there's like an impishness, you know, like when he says, all right, three lessons.
[46:50.160 --> 46:51.160]  Here's your first lesson. Reach out.
[46:51.160 --> 46:56.160]  And she literally reaches out and he snaps her hand with a big blade of grass.
[46:56.160 --> 46:59.160]  And she goes, do you feel it? She goes, I feel it. I feel it.
[46:59.160 --> 47:02.160]  Like that's Yoda. That's a total Yoda move.
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.160]  You know, part of the training of the traditional sort of like training from the ancient wisdom is like the student looks foolish.
[47:07.160 --> 47:10.160]  I mean, Luke is made to look foolish at many times being trained with Yoda too.
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.160]  Obi-Wan never does, though. Obi-Wan never makes him look foolish.
[47:14.160 --> 47:17.160]  Obi-Wan is a dignified British person who teaches you, you can do it.
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.160]  Like, you know, like he's very encouraging and supportive.
[47:20.160 --> 47:25.160]  And Yoda is, you know, yelling at Luke because he's dropping him when he's floating the rocks and everything.
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.160]  Yeah. On the other hand, Kenobi's giving him the basics, right?
[47:30.160 --> 47:35.160]  But it's just, you just can't see Kenobi ever doing something like that.
[47:35.160 --> 47:40.160]  I just like to block them out. And The Last Jedi doesn't do that.
[47:40.160 --> 47:46.160]  Another thing The Last Jedi does is it starts to bring in the prequels to explain Luke's disillusionment.
[47:46.160 --> 47:54.160]  He has to make oblique reference to how he makes explicit explicit to what's his name?
[47:54.160 --> 48:00.160]  Darth Sidious, which is a name we never got during the movies.
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.160]  No, they did say it. Darth Sidious? No. You're talking about the original trilogy, right?
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.160]  No, yeah. I'm talking about the real movies. Like the prequels, they mention it.
[48:10.160 --> 48:15.160]  But that coming out of Luke's mouth? No, we've never had that.
[48:15.160 --> 48:20.160]  Where did Luke learn all that? He must have been studying up on the Wikipedia pages after.
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.160]  Well, I mean, once you blow up the Emperor and you take over the galaxy, I'm going to guess there's a library.
[48:25.160 --> 48:30.160]  There's a lot of time for reading. Yeah, you can look this stuff up.
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.160]  Boy, these Jedi were dumb. I mean, at some place, he also went and found all those Jedi texts, right?
[48:36.160 --> 48:41.160]  No, no, no. They were already on the island. They were in that temple on the island.
[48:41.160 --> 48:45.160]  Okay, so he went there. He spent time researching this stuff, is what I'm saying.
[48:45.160 --> 48:53.160]  That's the other weird thing. Another thing that JJ set up is where Luke is hiding is back where the first Jedi were.
[48:53.160 --> 49:01.160]  Kind of like how Yoda went to this planet with tons of life, because it's a whole force thing, right?
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.160]  But for someone who was super disillusioned with the Jedi, you could take it two ways.
[49:06.160 --> 49:12.160]  One, that it's a discontinuity and they just had to deal with it because it's on the island and it doesn't quite match up.
[49:12.160 --> 49:18.160]  Or two, that despite all Luke's protestations about being disillusioned with the Jedi,
[49:18.160 --> 49:26.160]  he did go to the island where the original Jedi were, so it seems that he can't let go of the idea that the force is a thing that's worth holding on to.
[49:26.160 --> 49:36.160]  I'm very comfortable with that. I mean, if you're uncomfortable with your religion, going back to the first texts totally makes sense to me.
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.160]  Like, where did we go wrong with the bureaucracy is a completely reasonable thing to do.
[49:41.160 --> 49:51.160]  But in the end, he wants to burn down that tree. In the end, when he's trying to teach Rey about the force to say, basically, the Jedi don't own the force, right?
[49:51.160 --> 49:59.160]  That's a human concept. It's like the church. The church is made by man, but the difference between the church and actual God.
[49:59.160 --> 50:06.160]  It's like, the Jedi are a human construct. They are imperfect because humans are imperfect, but the force is fine.
[50:06.160 --> 50:14.160]  He wants to burn it down, not because he wants to burn the force down, but to say this structure that humans have made around the force, this whole Jedi Sith,
[50:14.160 --> 50:22.160]  and that is crap, but he can't quite bring himself to do it, because the same reason he went to the island, he kind of believes in the force.
[50:22.160 --> 50:26.160]  He believes in all the teaching, like, but Jedi are good, right?
[50:26.160 --> 50:33.160]  I totally wanted to be a Jedi, and I was so excited to be one, and to fulfill my destiny to become a Jedi, and blah blah blah.
[50:33.160 --> 50:38.160]  I can't bring myself to burn down, and Yoda's the one who pops in and says, I don't have a problem with it, I can burn it down.
[50:38.160 --> 50:47.160]  You're right. Yoda's always been on the same page of like, Yoda does not tell him, you know, here is what it means to be on the Jedi Council.
[50:47.160 --> 50:52.160]  He is all about the force, and what the force means, and all his stuff.
[50:52.160 --> 50:56.160]  I mean, he does mention Jedi a lot, because a Jedi cares not about blah blah blah blah blah.
[50:56.160 --> 51:04.160]  He uses the word Jedi, but because the prequels didn't exist, he makes no reference to the stupidity of Jedi bureaucracy,
[51:04.160 --> 51:12.160]  and the universe of the Jedi, and like, their little kiddie training schools, and picking slave children, and all sorts of other things that eventually came out of prequels.
[51:12.160 --> 51:19.160]  Before you lift your X-wing, have you filled out form JDI 882-6? No.
[51:19.160 --> 51:26.160]  I thought that, that was one of my favorite things about this movie, is that it acknowledged something that to me had gone unacknowledged,
[51:26.160 --> 51:33.160]  including in The Force Awakens in the previous movies, which was that to me, and again, maybe I was just reading too much into it,
[51:33.160 --> 51:41.160]  and I always, I do believe, very strongly, and I know I'm right on certain parts, that Lucas didn't have this whole thing written out.
[51:41.160 --> 51:47.160]  You know, there were vague ideas about what the prequels would be, and a lot of the stuff that ended up in him weren't really, you know,
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.160]  he didn't have this grand master plan and all these screenplays prewritten in 1977.
[51:52.160 --> 52:08.160]  But, to me, in the original trilogy, especially with what Kenobi says in Star Wars, it made it, to me, seem like Jedi were sort of solo individuals around the galaxy,
[52:08.160 --> 52:17.160]  yeah, like monks, and, you know, somebody who was called into the force would eventually, you know, you'd discover another Jedi and they would train you,
[52:17.160 --> 52:23.160]  but it was decentralized, is what I saw, a decentralized network of warrior monks.
[52:23.160 --> 52:28.160]  I never saw them as being inherently generals, or leading battles.
[52:28.160 --> 52:32.160]  Or having a big council and sitting around in a big circle.
[52:32.160 --> 52:39.160]  Well, I mean, when Kenobi's saying that Anakin- A fancy skyscraper, you know, Stark Tower on Coruscant.
[52:39.160 --> 52:45.160]  Yeah, well, when Kenobi's saying that Anakin was once his pupil, and he was the best of fellow people in the galaxy-
[52:45.160 --> 52:52.160]  He thought he could train him just as well as Yoda, and he was wrong, that goes into the whole sort of like master-apprentice, you know, system of-
[52:52.160 --> 52:57.160]  I honestly, right, I believed it more to be like a, you know, I don't know, like a-
[52:57.160 --> 52:58.160]  Like blacksmithing.
[52:58.160 --> 53:08.160]  Like a cobbler relationship, like I'll show you how to do this. The fact that they fought in the war together was incidental to the fact that there was a war going on.
[53:08.160 --> 53:09.160]  Yeah.
[53:09.160 --> 53:18.160]  Right. I happen to think, and I grew up under the assumption that Kenobi got involved, and she said, you know, you fought with my father as a general in the Clone Wars,
[53:18.160 --> 53:25.160]  that Kenobi made that choice as an individual, in my mind, that Kenobi was one of however many Jedi that were in the galaxy,
[53:25.160 --> 53:34.160]  and when the Clone Wars erupted, Obi-Wan Kenobi decided, I'm joining this war as a Jedi, and I'll become a general in this.
[53:34.160 --> 53:41.160]  I did not expect that all of the- that there was something like that, and it's one of the things that I like about the prequel trilogy,
[53:41.160 --> 53:50.160]  is that, again, it upended my expectations, and it was like, no, they were more like a quasi-government institution, but sort of anti-democratic, you know,
[53:50.160 --> 53:57.160]  like nobody else really had it there, they were influential in intergalactic politics, but like answerable to no one,
[53:57.160 --> 54:05.160]  and the whole lot of them joined the war, you know, and in a way that wasn't what I expected, it didn't seem like what it was set up,
[54:05.160 --> 54:11.160]  and it also made me feel like this is a corrupt organization, and I can see how their hubris led to their downfall.
[54:11.160 --> 54:20.160]  Yeah, there was something about Alec Guinness's portrayal of Kenobi that made you believe that he could have been a general in the war.
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.160]  That and Bridge Over the River Kwai, right?
[54:23.160 --> 54:34.160]  Well, first of all, Bridge Over the River Kwai, he's like a British gentleman in 1977, you could totally see him being an officer in World War II,
[54:34.160 --> 54:45.160]  like it was close enough, historically, to cement that this is a prototype of a character that could have gone and seen some hard times,
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.160]  and now he's moved beyond it and is being called back.
[54:49.160 --> 54:57.160]  The whole thing with the prequels, it did subvert my expectations, and I guess I have to tip my hat to that,
[54:57.160 --> 55:03.160]  but I don't know if it subverted them in a way that made me richer for it.
[55:03.160 --> 55:10.160]  If you roughly sketch out what the prequels are trying to do, you could make a semi-coherent story out of it,
[55:10.160 --> 55:17.160]  like three bullet points per movie, but in execution they just failed on every possible front,
[55:17.160 --> 55:25.160]  so I don't disagree with the overarching broad strokes of the prequels,
[55:25.160 --> 55:29.160]  but once you get down below the level of three bullet points per movie, everything falls apart.
[55:29.160 --> 55:38.160]  I really like, though, and I thought that that rant that Luke has in this movie is as close as...
[55:38.160 --> 55:42.160]  I almost feel like they don't need to do it anymore, but I feel like they've...
[55:42.160 --> 55:52.160]  Cinematically, Rian Johnson took it on himself to bridge all seven or eight movies, I guess, so far, together,
[55:52.160 --> 56:03.160]  and I feel like that was very successful. In a minimal amount of time, Luke's sort of, here's why I'm sickened by the Jedi and to hell with him,
[56:03.160 --> 56:10.160]  it tied them together in a way that hadn't been tried before, that the prequels kind of left as a problem,
[56:10.160 --> 56:13.160]  and that The Force Awakens just sort of skipped over.
[56:13.160 --> 56:19.160]  Yeah, well, because The Force Awakens, I mean, it's centering on Rey, who barely even knows that Luke Skywalker even is a real thing,
[56:19.160 --> 56:21.160]  and not just a story that she's heard.
[56:21.160 --> 56:23.160]  Yeah, she flat out thinks he's a myth.
[56:23.160 --> 56:29.160]  Right, and so she's not that close to it, but by the time we get into this movie, it's time to get down to brass tacks and see, like, what has ever...
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.160]  Because the prequels have now happened, so this movie has to be informed by it.
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.160]  And it does it in a way of, like, setting them aside. Like, it's taking the broad strokes from that.
[56:37.160 --> 56:42.160]  Like, look, the Jedi were stupid in the prequels, and we all agree that the Jedi were stupid in the prequels sometimes,
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.160]  and they actually sometimes not be either way. Like, they were shown to be an ineffective organization.
[56:46.160 --> 56:52.160]  And I like this movie's message about the Force with Yoda, because it's back on message from the Empire Yoda to say,
[56:52.160 --> 56:59.160]  it's all about the Force, and not so much about the bureaucracy of the Jedi and the Sith and that thing.
[56:59.160 --> 57:04.160]  It's about the Force, and there is a light side and a dark side, and there is a struggle between them,
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.160]  and Yoda is all about learning how not to give in to the dark side. Is this quicker, easier, more seductive?
[57:09.160 --> 57:16.160]  You know, like, I'm all on board with that, and I like that Yoda in this one is most able to let go of the trappings.
[57:16.160 --> 57:22.160]  Because first of all, the Yoda is long gone, right? Luke is the last one, and he needs Yoda to give him a kick over the cliff to say,
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.160]  look, what are you even holding on to? Like, you got a bunch of books and you. That's it. There's no more Jedi Council.
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.160]  Yoda is also long gone. He's been dead for a long time.
[57:33.160 --> 57:39.160]  Well, yeah, but he has less and less attachment to the physical world.
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.160]  We don't know how time passes in the magic Force ghost realm.
[57:43.160 --> 57:47.160]  Okay, well, he doesn't give a crap about the Jedi. He just blows up the tree.
[57:47.160 --> 57:50.160]  Yeah, I mean, it's a problem with the Force. It's a problem with the Force ghost.
[57:50.160 --> 57:53.160]  Because, like, this movie does change a bunch of rules about things.
[57:53.160 --> 57:59.160]  But, you know, as many people pointed out, in some ways they kind of potentially break things down the line.
[57:59.160 --> 58:02.160]  But, like, what's the deal with the Force ghosts? Can they come back forever and ever?
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.160]  Like, why don't we see the Force ghosts from, like, you know, 20 centuries coming back and talking about them?
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.160]  Is it just the ones that he knows? Did they ever age in the Force ghost place? Anakin got to be younger.
[58:11.160 --> 58:16.160]  Well, yeah. Well, there's two things about that. Well, okay, just a brief aside.
[58:16.160 --> 58:23.160]  I mean, who's to say that Kenobi's Force ghost didn't put those torpedoes down the hole when Luke fired them?
[58:23.160 --> 58:25.160]  Luke did that himself. He used the Force.
[58:25.160 --> 58:28.160]  Oh, yeah. Who said that Kenobi didn't do it for him?
[58:28.160 --> 58:33.160]  The second thing is that... They explained that Qui-Gon is the one who figured out how to be a Force ghost.
[58:33.160 --> 58:35.160]  There's no Force ghost before Qui-Gon.
[58:35.160 --> 58:38.160]  Okay, okay, okay. But he's still talking beyond the grave.
[58:38.160 --> 58:43.160]  Alright, as far as we know, though, Qui-Gon only figured it out to the part where he could, like, communicate.
[58:43.160 --> 58:46.160]  You know, and because Kenobi does it both ways.
[58:46.160 --> 58:49.160]  When Luke is going down the trench, he only hears his voice.
[58:49.160 --> 58:54.160]  And only in The Empire Strikes Back do we see the Force ghost.
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.160]  For all we know, Qui-Gon never got further than being able to communicate with Yoda vocally.
[58:59.160 --> 59:02.160]  He's got a very specific set of skills, Jon.
[59:05.160 --> 59:17.160]  My take on it is that Yoda has been able to extend it longer than Kenobi because Yoda was more powerful than the Force.
[59:17.160 --> 59:20.160]  And it helps that Yoda is a puppet.
[59:20.160 --> 59:27.160]  Well, Frank Oz is not a puppet. Frank Oz is still alive, and Alec Guinness is dead.
[59:27.160 --> 59:34.160]  And, what's his name? Ewan McGregor in makeup isn't really going to look like old Obi-Wan.
[59:34.160 --> 59:40.160]  And we've already established that when Obi-Wan appears as a ghost, he looks like Alec Guinness, not like Ewan McGregor.
[59:40.160 --> 59:45.160]  But I could, you know, if they could do it, maybe it would be interesting.
[59:45.160 --> 59:49.160]  It's one of the little things I've picked up on, I've thought about.
[59:49.160 --> 59:52.160]  We could go on a whole aside on this, but I need to do a break soon.
[59:52.160 --> 01:00:00.160]  But in The Force Awakens, when Rey has the vision when she first touches the lightsaber, among the many things she sees,
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:09.160]  there's things that come in this movie, like most probably iconically is Luke with his robotic hand on R2's helmet,
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:14.160]  or head, whatever you want to call the top of R2, watching his Jedi temple burn.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.160]  But one of the things in that sequence is you hear Obi-Wan say Rey,
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:31.160]  and there's a great backstory of how they kind of sampled a line from Alec Guinness where he happens to say the syllable Rey.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.160]  He says the word afraid, and it's a gray out of afraid.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:40.160]  Right. And then they took Ewan McGregor, I think, and had him say Rey, and they put him together, and it just, you know.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.160]  They also use the guy that does him in The Clone Wars. Like that was a stand-in.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:51.160]  It could be that that vision was the only communication she ever gets from Obi-Wan,
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.160]  but it could also be that maybe Obi-Wan will come and talk to Rey in the next movie.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.160]  I don't know how they would pull it off vocally, but I certainly get it.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.160]  So we'll talk about her parentage, but I don't know.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.160]  I don't know. I'm a Kenobi nerd. I won. I won him in, but I liked it easy.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  Let me take a break. Let me take a break here and thank our second sponsor.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:17.160]  And I'm very excited about this. They specifically requested the Star Wars Holiday Spectacular.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:23.160]  This is the first time they have ever sponsored a podcast, and they specifically wanted this show.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.160]  It is a company called Squarespace.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:35.160]  Squarespace is a company that they have, like, you go to Squarespace and you sign up, and they let you build your own website.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.160]  And when I mean build your website, you could build any type of website you want.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.160]  Like, you need, like, an online store. They can do it.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.160]  You want to start a new podcast? You could do it at Squarespace.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160]  You want to start a blog? You could do it at Squarespace.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.160]  You're like a designer with a portfolio? You want to create, like, a resume site? You could do it at Squarespace.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.160]  They have dozens, dozens, dozens of pre-built templates. They all look professional.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.160]  Any website you make with Squarespace looks so super professionally designed. It is amazing.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.160]  But you can customize it to your heart's content with your own branding, your own style.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.160]  And you do it all right in the browser. You don't have to code it. You don't get into the HTML.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.160]  You don't have to get into the CSS. Does that sound too good to be true? It does.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.160]  But I swear, that's the way it works. It is amazing.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.160]  I've never heard of this company before, but I checked it out, and it really is amazing.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.160]  And if you actually look around the web, you can find that a lot of the websites you use on a daily basis
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160]  are actually built on the Squarespace platform.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:39.160]  It's actually remarkably popular for a company that's never sponsored a podcast before.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.160]  Really a terrific thing. Next time you need to start a new website, I highly recommend that you start at Squarespace.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.160]  Give it, you know, half an hour, an hour of your time. Just see what you can get off the ground.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.160]  And you probably aren't going to look back. You'll just keep going.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.160]  They have a free trial that you can get started today.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160]  And if you remember this code, they have a code TALKSHOW.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  Know the, just TALKSHOW.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.160]  When you sign up and you start paying, if you use that code TALKSHOW, you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.160]  They'll let you prepay for a whole year, so you could save 10% off your whole first year of service.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:19.160]  So go to Squarespace.com next time you need a website and encourage them to sponsor a podcast at least one more time.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.160]  All right. I want to go back to this, this thing I was at about 20 to 30 minutes ago,
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:29.160]  which is that there's no gap between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.160]  And that this literally takes place like minutes afterwards.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:39.160]  You know, the resistance is fleeing their base because the Empire after the last movie is like,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.160]  there's no gap between on the island, but there is a gap on the resistance. The two timelines are not in sync.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.160]  I don't I don't think that's true. I think that that's immediately after the last movie.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.160]  No, I don't think so. I think the island stuff is obviously immediately after.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.160]  But the only way you could line up is if at the end of The Force Awakens, there's a time jump.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.160]  But I feel like those two things are not in sync because she's hanging out on that island for way longer.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160]  We keep cutting back to the resistance stuff,
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:10.160]  but we have like seven hours of the resistance and they cut back and forth between the resistance of the island.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  And it's like at least a week on the island. So those timelines are obvious.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.160]  No, I think that that chase I think the resistance is fleeing those ships for a week.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160]  I really do. I didn't change out.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:29.160]  So well, so I, I, you know, and they eventually sit on the side in that I do believe.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.160]  How do you explain the way that they sync back up on the salt? So here's here's how I do it.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  All right. So that's easy. She's just chilling out.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.160]  She's on the island and is doing a bunch of stuff on the island.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.160]  She's on the island for a long time before the rebels start fleeing their base.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.160]  So she she's just island, island, island, island, island, island.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.160]  And then the rebels flew their base.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:51.160]  And that's like in her last day or two that she's on the island before she bails.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160]  Right. So that's how they sync up.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.160]  It's just what we we cut back and forth between the two timelines.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.160]  But one is happening back in time. It's fine. Like, I don't think there's any problem with that.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.160]  But that might be the movie I feel like was telling me is these two timelines are not actually in sync.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.160]  Yeah, it's it suits the narrative pace of the movie.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:11.160]  And John, the other John.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.160]  Too many fucking Johns.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.160]  Only I can use John because I'm a big goober.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]  Goober. Here's the thing.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.160]  It would have taken the first order some time to figure out where that base was.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.160]  Right. Or else they would have just assaulted it in the previous movie.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:34.160]  If they knew minutes after, why weren't they there immediately as they launched their supergroup?
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:38.160]  Like a bunch of the crap just blew up like they have a grouping time.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.160]  Yeah, it takes some time to regroup. It's it's a lot.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.160]  You know, plus the crowd tells us that they've like militarily dominated the galaxy.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.160]  So they blew up the republic planets and you know, but then the super weapon was destroyed.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.160]  But they did blow up like like all the republic capitals or whatever.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:59.160]  And then the crawl tells us and and since blowing up all the republic capitals, they have been asserting their military force.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:05.160]  Exactly. Yeah. I'm on months here, which is a lot longer than what Luke.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.160]  Yeah. I mean, Luke got with Yoda.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.160]  I mean, that timeline gets you all whack too.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:19.160]  This was discussed on the incomparable with the title of one of the episodes was Jedi weekend of us trying to figure out exactly how long was he on Dagobah.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:26.160]  And those two timelines aren't in sync either because the Falcon chase with the asteroids and everything and Lando and all that stuff like that takes some time.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:34.160]  But it seems like Luke is on Dagobah for way longer. So it's harder to sync those two things up because there is a sync point in Empire where they're all on Hoth together.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:42.160]  So we know that's the thing. So but in the last Jedi, it's much easier just to say that, oh, a lot of the island stuff happened before the rebel base was discovered.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:50.160]  Here's the funny thing about that asteroid scene is that is actually like the physics are in real life.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:07:00.160]  So it takes about a month between asteroids. And so what you think is being awesome is, you know, really just careful plotting really, really complex environment.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.160]  Yeah. And it's played in fast motion. They speed it up for the sake of the narrative.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.160]  And also some of the asteroids are potatoes. Yes.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.160]  All right. I do feel and I feel like you have to compare it to Empire. I'm open to this.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:22.160]  I'm open to the idea here that you guys are right and I'm wrong and that that their discovery of the resistance base is weeks or months.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.160]  But even at the longest period of time that it is, is weeks or months, right?
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:40.160]  It's not years, whereas in the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy, there was all it was always very clear that had there had been a few years, at least as many years as in the real life release of the movies.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:50.160]  But like, you know, between episode one and two, clearly more because we saw the Anakin Skywalker is like a six year old and then he's, you know, like a 16 year old.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:57.160]  It was like a full decade. Who? Yeah, right. And in Empire, they make reference to like their past adventures.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:02.160]  Like, oh, that that that bounty hunter ran into an Ord Mandel, you know, changed my mind.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:09.160]  Everyone was clearly older. And, you know, that one line set off my imagination for years. Right.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:17.160]  Like, I'm telling you, I can't remember what I had for lunch today. And I remember that bounty hunter on Ord Mandel.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:24.160]  Like I was great, man. But you can just tell from the way they relate to each other that they had had adventures.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:30.160]  And the Kral also tells you that, like, you know, they blew up the Death Star and but the Empire is making a comeback.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.160]  And so the rebels thought they had the upper hand, but actually they've been chased farther and farther around.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.160]  And now they're on this base and they're, you know, like, so it's it's clear the time has passed.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.160]  And the Kral tries to do this as well, because you have to go from big victory to the rebels are on their heels again.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.160]  And that's mostly done by the Kral and by the passage of time.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.160]  And the Kral in The Last Jedi doesn't give us a counter of like, how long has it been?
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.160]  But I think it has been some time. I almost feel I wouldn't even say it was a comeback.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.160]  I feel like one of the triumphs of the Empire Strikes Back and and the whole movie is great,
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.160]  but the triumph of the whole battle of Hoth was the implication.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:12.160]  And to me, it was obvious right from the first time I watched it is, oh, you think the rebels really set the empire back by blowing up the Death Star?
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.160]  I mean, it was a great win. It was probably the best thing they could have ever done.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:26.160]  But the empire was so entrenched and the rebels rebel alliance so small that the empire was still a massive monolith.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:32.160]  The Death Star was a tool, not the machine. And the rebels were hiding like their strategy is hide.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.160]  So that's not the strategy where you feel like you could do well in a fair fight.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.160]  Right. It was like, oh, you thought that they had a huge win.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.160]  Yeah. Well, guess what? I have to say to your theory.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:49.160]  I'm really liking this theory that it's at least a couple of weeks after the force awakens where they discover the resistance base,
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.160]  because then that solves a problem I had, which was that.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:00.160]  And I still think it's a problem, really, honestly, is that they had the medal ceremony in Star Wars right there on Yavin.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.160]  The moon on Yavin four after they'd been outed.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.160]  Right. It's like, what should we do? Should we quickly evacuate before they send more star destroyers?
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.160]  Or should we put everybody that we've got in one small space to get blown up?
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.160]  And have a slow, slow marching medal ceremony.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.160]  They had time to polish off R2 and 3PO, too.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:31.160]  Right. And put like the most blatant speciesism, racism, omission of the Chewie medal.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  Justice for Chewie, man. Come on.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.160]  Well, since Wookiee's lived so long, when they're all dead, he just scoops up their medals one by one.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.160]  He's got Han's medal right now.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:50.160]  Yeah, he was great in the prequels.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160]  All right. I've got to bring this up.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.160]  It seems like as good a point as any, because we're not on a good roll right now.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:02.160]  Have you noticed that we're not actually talking about the movie at all?
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.160]  I said I was going to talk about things that I disliked about them.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.160]  We didn't have to do with Star Wars, and I haven't been keeping to that either.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.160]  And I also said that the things I'm mad about are not the things other people are mad about.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.160]  And I feel like people are going to think that I am not keeping to that by complaining about Luke.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.160]  But the biggest complaints I see about Luke is that he should have been more awesome.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.160]  And I just think he should have been more pathetic.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.160]  So I think it's a difference there. It's a nuance.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.160]  I said to God, go ahead, John.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.160]  I didn't mean to deal with that little quip.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:38.160]  I remember we were in Ireland a couple of years ago, probably for Ool, right?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  And it was me and you and Jonas walking through a park in Dublin.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.160]  And they had first announced the trilogy.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:12:02.160]  And my idea for Luke in the new trilogy was to just make it so that he was holding the galaxy and the rebellion together for 30 years as the one and only Jedi,
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:10.160]  and put scars on his face, make his mechanical hand rusted, scars on the face,
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:16.160]  and just make him like, wow, you thought Mark Hamill would look better than this after only 30 years. Make him look worse.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.160]  Just go into it and really have him.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:23.160]  I remember that well, and I think they went that direction a little bit.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.160]  But more emotionally than physically.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.160]  They went emotionally rather than physically, right.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:32.160]  They did give him a crazy beard.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:38.160]  You can see when he changes it up for his force projection, he's got the just for men, just for Jedi on his beard, and it's all trimmed and everything.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.160]  Yeah, I noticed that only on the second. I did not notice that the first time.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.160]  I have to say.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.160]  He's got a haircut.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.160]  We'll get to that. Let's put that aside.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.160]  Yeah, that's okay.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:07.160]  But so when you saw this Luke compared to the Luke that you sort of sketched out while we were chatting on that walk, how did you feel about that?
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.160]  It was in the ballpark.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.160]  They went more emotionally scarred than physically scarred, but I'm with it.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:22.160]  It is not how I would have written 30 years out Luke, but I'm okay with it.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:32.160]  I didn't get to write the Star Wars movie, and I do feel like Ryan Johnson clearly cared about and loves Luke and sees Luke.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:46.160]  The way he took Luke and how much was his decision, how much was the whole story group, how much was JJ involved with this, including omitting him from the first movie.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:54.160]  I don't know who to give credit for, but at the very least, I think it's very clear that they didn't make any of these decisions regarding Luke lightly.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:03.160]  It wasn't just like, ah, we don't care about him. He's from an old movie. We're going to concentrate on our new movies, and we're just going to throw this beloved character in the garbage.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:10.160]  That's one of my points about these is that I gave The Force Awakens a pass because that's got to be, I assumed there would be a transition.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:18.160]  You have transition from the old people to the new people because that's the future of the franchise, and you just can't have the, you know, so does transition mean you have to kill them all off?
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.160]  Does it mean they just retire in glory? Like whatever, but you got to transition.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:30.160]  So first movie, you kill Han. Probably the only way to get Harry's support in the movie was to promise to kill Han, right? Because he wanted to die in Jedi.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:41.160]  And so I give them that, right? But then with the second movie, with so much Luke in the second movie, and so like zero of them basically in the first movie, it's like, then I started to get this sinking feel.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:53.160]  I was like, wait a second, we're two movies into this trilogy. I thought the first one would be about the transition and the handoff to the new people, and I thought the second movie would be like 90% Rey with Luke filling maybe a Yoda role.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:01.160]  And if Carrie Fisher was still alive, it'd be like, so they would do like the third one would be Leia's movie? And I was like, you just wasted a whole trilogy phasing out the classics.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  And as much as I love the classics, I wanted the new movies to be about new characters, because I think Rey deserves a trilogy that is as centered on her as the original was on Luke, because that's what The Force Awakens sets up.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.160]  It's like, guess what? Rey is going to go on the hero's journey.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.160]  As centered on Poe Dameron as the original was on Han Solo.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.160]  Well, Poe was supposed to die in the first movie, so you can kind of see that.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.160]  Finn Rey and Poe, basically.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:39.160]  But also, like Han Solo, Han Solo was only really supposed to be a bit character in the first movie and turned into such a...
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:45.160]  And you can introduce who's going to be Orlando in the second movie, you can introduce new people, but I expected it to be more about that.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:56.160]  And it seems clear to me now that this trilogy, I don't know what they're going to do with Carrie Fisher, but they've already spent two movies spending a lot of time talking about the old characters.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:02.160]  And I guess it's fine. They're not going to be alive forever, and they're not going to be able to do Star Wars movies forever, so you might as well use them while you got them.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.160]  You'll have plenty more Star Wars movies, and in hindsight, it makes sense. It's just not what I expected.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:16.160]  So while we're on it, how great... Well, you go first. I'll go for you.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:23.160]  Two things. Carrie Fisher, we love you. Thank you for everything.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:33.160]  That was my point. How great was she? She was so good.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:42.160]  I really, really loved her in this movie. I liked her in The Force Awakens, too, and I'm so glad to see her.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:57.160]  I like the way that... This isn't makeup or CGI, it's just the way Carrie Fisher aged, but I like the way she aged, and I love that she's got this sort of tough, old, broad voice now.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:03.160]  That's just what Carrie Fisher's voice ended up sounding like. This is a case of how Luke seemed like Mark Hamill, the actor, a lot.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:17.160]  Carrie Fisher, the actress, fits exactly like how you'd expect Leia to age, because she was a fireplug in the first movie, and she didn't take no guff from nobody, and you would totally see her turning into modern-day Carrie Fisher.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:31.160]  I agree, and one of the things you said earlier about Mark Hamill asserting himself to the character, I think that even as a filmmaker as talented as G.J. Abrams or Rian Johnson,
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:41.160]  when the heroes that you grew up with tell you what they think the character should do, I think there's an inherent amount of deference to it.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:56.160]  Not because you feel that they can strong-arm you, or not because you feel it can go against your plot, but because these people have invested their lives in being these characters in many ways.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:08.160]  And I think it would be in sort of going against the tide, or going against the flow of things, to sort of argue with them on where they think the character should go.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:14.160]  Yeah, Rian didn't go with what Mark Hamill wanted. Mark Hamill was much more about the Boy Scout, earnest, deep-feeling, do-gooder...
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:27.160]  I agree, and hence why I think that what probably should have remained a private, creative discussion is so fascinating to me. I love the fact that we got to hear that.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:35.160]  I mean, we've all made stuff. How many times have you argued with somebody that we should do this instead of that? It happens all the time.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:43.160]  I bet no one argued with Harrison Ford about what Han Solo was supposed to do, though.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.160]  Well, you know what? Amy might have just murdered him herself.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:52.160]  Imagine if Han Solo had turned cowardly, and he was like a little weasel.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.160]  It can't happen.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.160]  But I don't think that happened with Luke either.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:09.160]  It's just slightly off. And like I said, I want to reiterate, 30 years, man, a lot of stuff can happen in 30 years, but it's up to the movie to make me believe it, because we all know where we last left Luke.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:20.160]  And it's true of a lot of things. To finally get into more of the structural things about this movie, if you were to give a rough outline of what this movie's supposed to be doing, and its general themes, and the plot threads...
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:30.160]  I mean, especially the themes. We already went over the themes about how the Jedi and the Sith are not the Force. The Force is separate from them, and those are human institutions or aliens or whatever.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.160]  They leverage it. They use it.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.160]  That's one theme, and burning down the Jedi tree. So whatever. That's a thread, a plot line there.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:52.160]  You've got Rey's thread, Rey and Kylo. They have a thread about we're going to progress those characters, and we're going to resolve the Snoke thing, but bring those two closer together and have them to be kind of a proxy for figuring out what the Force really is in this new age.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:20:08.160]  Then you've got Finn and Rose are going to inform sort of the big picture of what's going on in the galaxy these days. What is the incoming inequality in the galaxy?
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:15.160]  How does the Republic and the Resistance and the First Order and the Citizenry fit in with all that? That's their thread.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.160]  And then I guess finally you have First Order versus the Resistance, which is the thread we kind of pick up on.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:33.160]  That's a lot of threads already to begin with, but as you zoom in on those threads and say, okay, well, brass tacks, how are you going to tell me about incoming inequality in the galaxy?
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:38.160]  Well, Jon, I'm going to give you a leaflet that identifies each of them.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:51.160]  Because it's a lot of threads for a movie, and they introduce new characters, and in broad strokes I'm mostly on board with everything they're doing, but when it comes down to the execution, I feel like some threads are stronger than others.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:21:05.160]  Let's put it that way. And if push came to shove, I would say, is it really that important for me to learn about arms dealers and stuff, or if we cut that thread, can we give more time to what, to my mind, are the threads that I care more about?
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:14.160]  There was a little bit too many characters and a little bit too many threads, which would have been fine if they had pulled it off, but some of them are demonstrably weaker than others.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:28.160]  Not just in terms of how good is the writing and how good is the acting and so on and so forth, but mechanically speaking, is the movie able to keep the audience on the same page with it about what they're seeing and why and what it's about?
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:44.160]  And I feel like that falls down, with the Rose Finn thread being the weakest, I think, not because the ideas are bad or because they shouldn't have had a thread like that, but just plain old in execution, like in terms of does the audience follow along with what's going on?
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:52.160]  Are they engaged? Are the characters doing things that are, like it's just, and that's not about Star Wars. That's just plain about movie making.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:58.160]  And here's where I warmly disagree with you, but we'll get to that. So, Gruber, what do you think?
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:08.160]  I'm okay with the fact, I've seen people complain about the fact that the Rose Finn adventure to Canto Bight didn't even matter.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:18.160]  You know, it didn't matter because it ended up not playing into the rest of them. I'm okay with that. I like it, like a sort of red herring that you think, oh, this is how they're going to get out of this.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:28.160]  I think the plot threads don't matter if they're engaged with it and they love what's going on and it's coherent, but if there's anything off about it, people will find things to complain about, like, oh yeah, and in the end, it doesn't even matter.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:46.160]  I just thought that the whole thread was the one thing, and honestly, and I feel like I can say this because I've said already on this show that I liked the prequel trilogy more than most people my age did, but that whole sequence on Canto Bight was very prequelly to me.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:23:01.160]  I thought that the way that it looked, I thought that the CGI-ness of it, the way the camera moved, like when you first go in the casino, and the camera just sort of goes across this and everybody you see is an alien.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:16.160]  That was an homage to, what was that movie? You know what it was, Guy? A very old, I think, silent film. I did a shot that was like that, and that was an homage to that.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160]  I did before you actually asked me, but now I'm blanking.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:26.160]  Everyone who's listening to this knows and is yelling at the podcast right now. But anyway, it's a movie bus movie shout out basically.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:39.160]  I thought that the chase scene through Canto Bight with these escaped, whatever you call their version of horse races, race horses, smashing up the city streets, I thought it looked terrible. I really did.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:51.160]  In a way that I thought a lot of the CGI stuff in the original prequel trilogy looked bad. It just didn't look good. It just looked fake. It looked like it was watching a video game, not a movie. I really didn't like it.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:24:05.160]  And I just thought it just felt prequel-y, like the pod racing scene. It just is going on and on. Here's another one of these things busting up another bar. Here it is busting up a speeder. Here it is busting over and over and over again.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:23.160]  And it just didn't seem, there's so much, you know, it's ridiculous to complain about realism in the Star Wars trilogy. It's not that it wasn't realistic, but the physics of Star Wars are generally pretty realistic.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:36.160]  And the prequels I feel like lost that, where it got very cartoony physics-wise. And I felt like that whole scene on Canto Bight was like that. And then the other thing that was prequel-y about it was the sort of political nature of it.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:52.160]  And I personally even agree with the basic premise of the politics of it and being opposed to war profiteering and stuff. But it just sort of, I don't know, it just felt like it was detached from the rest of the story threads.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:25:04.160]  I mean, I thought John's summary of the threads of the movie was perfect. I thought that was really, really good. And I really do think that this one, it just doesn't get braided with the other threads.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:17.160]  Not only does it not get braided, but I think it is clumsily executed. So we get it. We get the message that they're trying to say. But the characters that you have in this thread to convey the message, they spend a lot of time doing things that are not in support.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:30.160]  Because remember, they're there to get the code breaker, and there's also some McGuffin stuff to get them there, right? And then they throw in the horses and the slave children, and you got to get the other code breaker, the DJ guy, right?
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:45.160]  They do a lot of things that, there's a lot of moving around and moving parts that aren't in service of the message. The few bits they get are in service of the message are, DJ shows them that on the ship they steal, this person sells arms to the First Order, but also sells them to the Resistance.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:26:05.160]  So you get that one scene, which is, it's okay. It's, you know, it's a little bit on the nose, but it's still fine. You get the kind of, like, the thread of Rose and Finn seeing the slave children and inspiring them, but freeing the horses? Like, do we care about the horses? Or do we care about the slave kids?
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:15.160]  And then Finn being like, but this, even if we die, it was all worth it to wreck their town, but you didn't even really wreck it, and why the hell do you, you would never say it was all worth it to wreck their town. You're supposed to be saving your friends.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:30.160]  Like, it's not, it's clumsily executed, right? I know what they're trying to get at, but you haven't put the characters into positions where they can convey that. Like, I don't believe that this, the thread doesn't connect up with itself. Just basic mechanics.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  Who are the characters? What are they doing and why? And you have them deliver lines like that. It's like, it was worth it just to make them heart. It's like, what? No, it wasn't. And you didn't hurt them. And this is stupid.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:49.160]  So they're literally hours away from the destruction of the entire Resistance, and they decide that the most important priority is vandalizing speeders.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:27:09.160]  You want to vandalize the town and leave, but have him deliver the line that it was worth it to show that he's super duper in support of helping like the slave kids and being against the rich people. Like, and Jon doesn't like it. They say people who gamble and go to Vegas are bad, and Jon's already on his heels and saying, I don't agree with that at all. Like, they have very reasonable prices for rooms and very good food.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:13.160]  Okay, well, let's not drag each other into the ethical mud.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:23.160]  Okay, go ahead. If you built a casino next to a racetrack. Yeah, it was definitely Monte Carlo.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:30.160]  If you built a casino, a high end premium luxury casino next to a racetrack.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:43.160]  Why in the world would it be so flimsily constructed that the race going on, which probably happens every day, would shake the drinks to the point where they spill? It's ridiculous.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  Those are just regular horse sized things, and they're running on dirt. Like, how could it shake anything? There's lots of things about it that are just mechanically, and they just spend a lot of time there.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:28:04.160]  And a lot of us in the MacArthur and stuff, and you need the code breaker and you need a reason to get in there. But like the whole thread, like, look, if you can make it work, you can make that thread work with just like a DJ and the arms dealer.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  Like, not even having to go to a planet, but I would love to pull that thread and give more time to the other ones. And that's setting aside. I love Rose.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:27.160]  I love her plot line. I love her. To the credit of this movie, every character in it, both old and new, like newly introduced in this movie, gets to have a hero moment and an arc.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:41.160]  And that is very difficult to do. But if you could somehow keep Rose and give her something else to do with or without Finn, I'm not against the characters, and I'm not even against the message of the thing.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:50.160]  I'm just against the execution script. Like, you know, if you decide this is the message we want to get out in this movie, how do we do it?
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.160]  And you write this shaggy dog story. It's like, can we find a different way to get that out with less time?
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:08.160]  So I think it could have been done. I would have done it. The way I would have done it off the top of my head is I would have the same basic plot where these two, Rose and Finn, are going to defy Admiral Holda's,
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.160]  you know, they're going to go on a secret mission with Poe Dameron, you know, sort of plotting to tie into Poe's arc.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:26.160]  Yeah. And they go get DJ and it doesn't take any time. And then their whole adventure takes place on the Imperial ship.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.160]  I really think you're missing the whole point of this thing.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.160]  I don't think we're missing it. We're just complaining about how it was delivered. Like, we're all on board with the message.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  So the delivery is poor. It is definitely shoehorned into a movie where it doesn't need to exist.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:47.160]  On the other hand, for the first time in Star Wars, we see two people of color going on a little adventure.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.160]  Do they screw it up narratively? Yes.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.160]  Could it be cut and the movie could be probably better for it? Yeah, probably.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:04.160]  But you know what, there's a lot of people that are watching that and being like, now Star Wars is now talking to me.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:09.160]  I love Rose and I'm even on board with the Rose-Finn kiss, which I heard people complain about. It makes perfect sense to me.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:19.160]  No, I'm not even saying that you guys are against it. I'm just saying that, like, despite the fact that this is clearly a break from making it a good movie,
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:31.160]  it is in service of it being a new mythology. We said at the beginning that you watch Star Wars over and over and over and over.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:36.160]  People are going to watch this over and over. And you can't.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:44.160]  I think you can't diminish what people are going to be able to take out of that little weird side adventure.
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:54.160]  And hold us to our own. And for that reason, I admire it. Do I think it makes it a better movie, a better coherent narrative?
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:31:03.160]  Probably not. But I like that they put it in there because it's bigger than a movie, right? At this point, this is not just a movie.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.160]  You can have what you're asking for without all of the bad things.
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:15.160]  When I first saw the bomber pilot die and that Rose had the same necklace, I totally thought that they were partners.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:21.160]  Which would have been a different way to go with that. But either way.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:26.160]  Which is weird because you and I both have broken heart lockers.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.160]  I don't know about the whole magic lockers thing. It just always seems like a romantic thing. But what do I know?
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:37.160]  It works fine either way. And I like her character and I like her as a foil for Finn.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:43.160]  Especially since Finn has had a rough day in The Force Awakens and is still a little frazzled in this.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:50.160]  And she's so much more grounded. I'm not sure they did a great job selling you on the fact that she's romantically interested in Finn.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.160]  You buy it based on circumstance.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:55.160]  I don't know. I mean, a kiss in Star Wars is like...
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:32:01.160]  There's something you have to do in a movie to set that up. To say, I see what she sees in Finn.
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:05.160]  All you need is one look or one line. Here's the thing with these movies.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.160]  Movies with lots of characters, and I said this in the incomparable.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:11.160]  When you have lots of characters, and there are lots of characters. You've got the old characters, right?
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:15.160]  You've got the new characters in The Force Awakens and then they added more characters in this movie.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.160]  That's a lot of characters. That's a Marvel movie level of characters.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:22.160]  When you have tons of characters, you can't give that much time to all of them.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.160]  But if you want them to all have meaningful arcs, the writing is so important.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:31.160]  You're going to get three sentences, five meaningful glances, and four actions the whole movie.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:37.160]  Build arcs out of that. You have to pack so much into those lines and those looks and those actions.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:43.160]  That if you burn one on something stupid, then it's like, oh, I didn't really pick up that Rose was crushing on Finn.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.160]  But now I kind of see it, right?
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:53.160]  It's so hard to do, and I think some of the latter-day Marvel movies, whether they be Avengers movies or Captain America Civil War or whatever,
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.160]  who just have tons of characters in them, some that we know and some that are newly introduced,
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:08.160]  do a better job of giving cleverly written, concise, information-dense dialogue and lines.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:12.160]  And there are bad Marvel movies too, but that is a really difficult challenge.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.160]  One way to avoid that challenge is to not do that, to not bite off that much,
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:20.160]  to trim down your characters, to concentrate on just the Rey and Kylo story thread,
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.160]  or cut some threads, condense some things, right?
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.160]  The other way is to just be really, really good at it.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:34.160]  And that's hard to do, and I feel like they fell short of even the highest Marvel bar set for this.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.160]  They fell short of it.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:41.160]  How many characters were added in Empire? Off the top of my head, you finally get to see the Emperor.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.160]  Yoda.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.160]  Lando has a big role. Yoda has a huge role.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:50.160]  The Emperor is seen in a hologram, but it's like 30 seconds, so it's sort of a hint.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:56.160]  Yeah, you've got a cavalcade of Imperial officers who Vader chokes, who are good characters,
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:01.160]  because a lot of them die off, but you've got them giving looks to each other.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.160]  I don't know if they count as characters.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.160]  As an aside, as a bit character who dies quickly,
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.160]  I loved the Imperial officer of the, I think they called it a dreadnought.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.160]  Yeah, the bulldoggy kind of guy.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.160]  There's super stuff I love about this.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:25.160]  Because I think part of the problem, one problem I have with both of these movies is that
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.160]  Hux is not a badass, right?
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.160]  He's really loud.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:38.160]  He is loud, but he's no Tarkin, right? I mean, Tarkin was terrifying.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.160]  Well, you know, well, here's the thing. Hitler was a great orator,
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:51.160]  and I think Hux served that role under Snoke.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.160]  He's mostly there to be Kylo Ren's annoying coworker.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.160]  Yeah, but I mean, the fact that this dreadnought captain was like,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.160]  this is an incredibly bad strategy. What are we doing?
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.160]  I loved it, and he ends up dying for it, which is my favorite kind of bad guy.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.160]  The bad guy that's competent enough to know that what he's doing is dumb,
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.160]  but tells the boss and then dies anyway.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:22.160]  I think we might have been meant to take Hux more seriously in The Force Awakens,
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:28.160]  but Rian Johnson correctly read that the audience is not entirely on board
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.160]  with taking Hux seriously, so I'll put him in this movie and show him to be as ridiculous as we all think he is.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.160]  Yeah, same thing with Kylo Ren.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.160]  Oh, yeah, more undercutting, like the mask and everything.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:47.160]  But I don't even think that was undercutting, because the whole movie doesn't try to pull off like,
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  oh, yeah, no, Kylo Ren just likes masks. No, he's totally doing it because he's a Vader fanboy,
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160]  and that bubble needed to be popped.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.160]  And even Snoke calls him out for it, which I loved.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.160]  I didn't like how they really cranked over the voice to be like,
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160]  oh, isn't this dumb that he doesn't affect his voice?
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.160]  Because I like Kylo Ren's voice in The Force Awakens.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.160]  I like that voice. It did an awesome job.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.160]  And then in The Last Jedi, they totally overcrank it to be like,
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.160]  hey, do you remember how dumb this voice sounded?
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.160]  I'm like, oh, no, it sounded cool in the first movie.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.160]  I honestly don't. Well, maybe it was to sound...
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.160]  So one thing I do recall is that Gruber, you didn't like when he took his mask off
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.160]  in the first movie, and I was a big fan because he was playing it as a power move
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:34.160]  when he took it off to Rey. Rey calls him a monster behind a mask,
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.160]  so he takes off the mask to try to...
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:41.160]  I guess I'm okay with it now. I will rescind my criticism of that.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:48.160]  And I see it now as exactly what Sir Cusa just said.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.160]  He had a Vader fanboy complex, and that can't last three movies long.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.160]  It was an interesting character trait.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:01.160]  It was always set up to be as an immature thing that isn't sustainable
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.160]  and that you would imagine he would be ridiculed about.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.160]  He's going to hug you on his face, and he keeps taking his lightsaber to computer banks.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.160]  That's not good.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.160]  So that parlays into something that I found interesting about the writing
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.160]  in both of these movies, but especially here in The Last Jedi,
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:27.160]  is that Vader gets mentioned a lot, including by Snoke,
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.160]  and Snoke seems to have a Vader boner, too.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:36.160]  He really is talking of Vader, and they don't mention Palpatine once.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.160]  Vader is the guy that even Snoke seems obsessed with
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:46.160]  from the previous Dark Lords who ruled the galaxy, not the Emperor.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:53.160]  And I almost feel like that's one of those ways where the characters are speaking for the fans.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.160]  If you think, who's the best bad guy in Star Wars?
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.160]  You immediately say, well, Darth Vader.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  Darth Vader's probably the best bad guy in any movie ever made.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160]  You don't think the Emperor.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  Well, the Emperor has the things to recommend him,
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160]  but I don't think it's speaking for the fans.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.160]  I think it's speaking for the original trilogy.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.160]  Because in the original trilogy, Vader hunted down and destroyed the Jedi.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.160]  He is the big bad until the Emperor creeps in to be really important.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.160]  Wait, is that actually said?
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.160]  Yeah.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.160]  Oh, yeah, I know. Ben says that.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160]  He doesn't say, Palpatine hunted down.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.160]  The prequels tell us, basically, that Palpatine is the one who killed all the Jedi.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.160]  But if you pretend the prequels don't exist,
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.160]  the original trilogy says Vader hunted down and destroyed the Jedi.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.160]  So you can imagine if Snoke has not seen the prequels, he would be like,
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.160]  Vader, that guy hunted down and destroyed the Jedi.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:39.160]  The Jedi were a big problem for us, and he got rid of them, so that's great.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:42.160]  And, oh, yeah, there was Palpatine doing some stuff or whatever.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.160]  The prequels put Palpatine in the driver's seat, and Vader is this stupid idiot,
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:48.160]  and we don't like those movies.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.160]  Right. I thought that was interesting.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:57.160]  So that leads me to, to me, I think it's problematic.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.160]  I think it's problematic that we're now two movies into a three-movie trilogy,
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:11.160]  and Snoke is literally just an Emperor-like bad guy with very strong force powers.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.160]  And there's no hint of a backstory.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.160]  Like, I'm not asking them to give me the backstory.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.160]  I'm asking for just the Ord Mandel hint of a backstory that makes me,
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.160]  ooh, wish that I could, ooh, make a movie about that.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:33.160]  Like, to me, that is the key difference between the 456 trilogy
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:37.160]  and the prequel trilogy is that the 456 trilogy had all of these hints
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:42.160]  of things that had happened, like the entire description of the Clone Wars
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.160]  is just you fought with my father in the Clone Wars.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.160]  That's it. You just hear that there was a thing 20 years earlier
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.160]  called the Clone Wars, and it's up to you to imagine what that meant.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:58.160]  All of these little touches that hint at this big story,
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:05.160]  and Vader betrayed your father, and, you know, there's none of that about Snoke.
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:09.160]  None of it. There's no, he's just a generic boogeyman force guy.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:15.160]  And the thing that makes it stick out to me is, I mean, how old is Snoke in this movie?
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160]  I mean, who knows what race he is?
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.160]  He's looking pretty good for 600 years old. I don't know.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.160]  He certainly looks like he's at least old enough that he was, you know,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.160]  he's not 30 years younger.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.160]  It's not the year as long as the mileage.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  Right, he looks like he had his head cracked open at one point.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:37.160]  But it seems pretty clear that he was alive 30 years ago
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.160]  when the Emperor and Vader were ruling the galaxy.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.160]  Like, where was this dark, powerful...
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.160]  Yeah, I think that's what I was saying before.
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:51.160]  It's okay for a sequel to Subvert Expectations,
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:56.160]  but it happens so much in this movie that it's hard not to think
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.160]  that it has something to do with some sort of disagreement
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:03.160]  about where these things are going between JJ and Rian Johnson.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.160]  Because Rian Johnson doesn't undercut some of them,
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.160]  but he undercuts a ton of them.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:12.160]  And some of them, like Snoke, are undercut in a way that is not only unexpected,
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.160]  but that just drops it on the floor.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.160]  Literally undercut.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  And they left him on the floor.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.160]  And the thing is, I like Snoke in this movie.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.160]  I thought the CG for him was great.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.160]  I thought he was a character that was distinct from the Emperor,
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:29.160]  both in style and in speaking and in force powers.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.160]  And in many, many ways, other than being an ugly dude,
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.160]  he didn't seem Palpatine-like to me at all.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.160]  And no, we don't know where he comes from,
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.160]  but in the first movie, he's set up to be mysterious
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:46.160]  and he'll become more important later.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.160]  And they've done this in the prequels a ton,
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.160]  where Count Dooku's stupid guy shows up,
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.160]  he's going to be important,
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:56.160]  no, he'll kill him in the first scene of the next movie, it's like, whatever.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.160]  You don't even care that much.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:02.160]  Any one of these things that we're talking about is fine to be changed in The Last Jedi,
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.160]  but to change all of them and to drop all of them
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.160]  just makes me think that there was a hard left turn somewhere
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  in the story plotting for this thing.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.160]  And it totally makes it fascinating to see,
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.160]  do we turn back on quote-unquote on course to the JJ course?
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.160]  Or do we continue this hard turn?
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.160]  Or do we do a spin-out and go vertically?
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.160]  It's going to be very interesting to see what they do in the next movie.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.160]  But yeah, in this movie, Snoke gets to be a cool character,
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:30.160]  but Jon is not going to be satisfied that we learn anything about him.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.160]  I mean, they can still tell you the next movie stuff about him,
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.160]  but it's like, he's dead now, so I really hope he's dead now.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.160]  So whatever we learn, it's like, oh, that's nice,
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.160]  but it's not a factor anymore, right?
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.160]  So I've got a few points about that.
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.160]  First of all, if Snoke had been more compelling
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.160]  and probably didn't have the name Snoke,
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.160]  I would be more interested in hearing his backstory.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.160]  More compelling in The Fourth Awakens, you mean?
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.160]  Yeah, well, I mean, he is just an all-powerful thing that we don't.
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:04.160]  He's got his thing about being inside your mind and stuff.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.160]  No, no, I got it.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:13.160]  It's all about projection, but he's not, say, Wolverine.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.160]  He's not Darth Vader.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.160]  How the hell did this happen?
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.160]  And you don't want it.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.160]  And as soon as you reveal the backstory,
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.160]  it lessens the character that you actually know and love.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.160]  I never got that sense from him.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.160]  I did not care.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.160]  It's like, okay, I don't understand how Luke can light up his lightsaber
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:45.160]  to kill his nephew without going out to murder Snoke first.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.160]  None of that makes sense to me.
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160]  If you're worried about big sources of the dark side,
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160]  you know Snoke is manipulating him.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.160]  Maybe go to the source first.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.160]  Don't murder him instead of your nephew.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:59.160]  That seems pretty straight up to me.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.160]  And that plays right into my biggest complaint,
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160]  single biggest complaint about the prequels,
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.160]  which doesn't seem to be anybody else's biggest complaint.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.160]  But my biggest complaint is in Revenge of the Sith.
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.160]  At the end, I'll go all the way to the end of Revenge of the Sith
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.160]  and the beginning of the final act and why in the world
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:19.160]  didn't Yoda and Obi Wan go to get the Emperor together first
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.160]  and then we'll figure out what to do with Anakin.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.160]  But maybe just by killing the Emperor,
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.160]  it'll break the hold he has on Anakin.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.160]  They won't even have to kill him.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.160]  But why in the world would they separate there?
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.160]  If they're really worried about how strong the Emperor is
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160]  and they were right to be,
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.160]  why in the world wouldn't they go together?
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:42.160]  It's the most ridiculous thing in the entire...
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.160]  There are so many ridiculous things.
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.160]  You're right, that's not my biggest complaint,
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:48.160]  but that is a legitimate complaint.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160]  Yeah.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160]  Hamid Surikusa. That's dumb.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.160]  I'm with you guys. I loved Snoke in this movie.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.160]  I wish there was a backstory, just a hint of it,
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.160]  just some sort of explanation.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160]  Like he was an old Jedi gone to bed
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.160]  or like he was a disciple of Palpatine
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.160]  or why did he get that big split in his head?
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.160]  You don't need much.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.160]  Just a hint, just a hint.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.160]  Oh my God, what was the guy that started cloning the clones
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.160]  in episode two?
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.160]  The big Q-tip head guys?
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.160]  No, no, the guy that went Kenobi shows up
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.160]  and he's like, oh yeah.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.160]  Oh, it's a name only.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.160]  Master blah blah blah showed up and he wanted...
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.160]  Just make him mad.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.160]  Something Pacificus?
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.160]  Yes, who cares?
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.160]  Seifer Dios.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.160]  Holy cow, you are a nerd.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.160]  Just make him Seifer Dios.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.160]  It's fine.
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.160]  Yes, right.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160]  That's fine.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160]  Say something like that.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.160]  Then kill him.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160]  No problem.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160]  I don't care about him,
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.160]  but at least you've given him a little bit of grounding
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.160]  that he's been being an asshole for 50 years, 60 years.
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.160]  That would be great.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.160]  That would have been so great.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.160]  He's Seifer Dios, he's an old Jedi
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.160]  and Palpatine sent him into exile
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  as like a plan B decades ago and that's how he also became
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:06.160]  the head of the First Order.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.160]  You don't have to show any of it, just a hint of it
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:10.160]  that there was something there.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.160]  I don't know.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.160]  But in terms of what you actually see on screen,
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.160]  I have to agree.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.160]  The CGI was terrific.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.160]  It was amazing.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.160]  I totally bought him, totally bought him.
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:21.160]  Love the acting from Andy Serkin.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.160]  Love the writing.
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:23.160]  Circus.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:24.160]  Circus.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:30.160]  I love the idea that he's sort of a Palpatine-like guy
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.160]  who's like the forte in the Force is sort of mental.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.160]  He's like a counter-intelligence kind of.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.160]  He's in your head.
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.160]  His whole move was connecting Rey and Kylo
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.160]  and manipulating them that way,
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.160]  which is not an impersonal thing to do.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.160]  Non-consensual Force time.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.160]  Face time.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:50.160]  Not good.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.160]  That's creepiest.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.160]  And that his faith and his power,
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.160]  his confidence in his power was his downfall
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.160]  because he saw everything more or less correctly.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.160]  In the same way that he made Rey and Kylo both see each other,
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:06.160]  they saw legit things like,
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.160]  Oh, I see that you're going to back me
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160]  and I see that you're going to back me.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.160]  All those things did happen momentarily
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.160]  and that's what made them both believe
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.160]  that they were coming together.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.160]  That's part of his plan.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:18.160]  That's exactly what Kylo uses to kill him.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.160]  The only weird thing in the movie, though,
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.160]  and when you get Rian Johnson on the program,
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.160]  you can ask him about that, is...
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.160]  He'll be coming out of the green room soon.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.160]  Well, you know what?
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.160]  He is in the green room, actually.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:32.160]  So the movie is telling you,
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.160]  I'm pretty sure having seen it twice now,
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.160]  the movie is telling you with its moving pictures
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.160]  and the language of movies
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.160]  that Kylo Ren comes up with the plan,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.160]  the specific plan, not the general idea
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  of like, I totally got to kill the Snoke dude,
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.160]  but the specific plan of how I'm going to kill Snoke
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:47.160]  comes up with it on the spot
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160]  because his lightsaber gets chucked on the floor
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.160]  towards him and spins,
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.160]  because the camera focuses on that
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.160]  and then he's like,
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.160]  oh, watch it the next time you see it
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:57.160]  that they show you that shot
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:58.160]  and the idea is like,
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  oh, rotating a lightsaber,
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.160]  that's my way out of doing it.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160]  And then he executes the plan by saying,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.160]  you know, I see what's happening
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.160]  and Snoke's reading his mind
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.160]  and he's just so slightly off, right?
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.160]  But then he gets the idea
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.160]  from seeing his own lightsaber by happenstance
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.160]  spin on the floor in front of him,
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.160]  which means that it was very improvised.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.160]  It's not like he went in there
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:20.160]  and like, it wouldn't surprise me
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.160]  that Kylo Ren doesn't have a concrete plan.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160]  He's just kind of got anger and feelings
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:25.160]  and he's kind of sick of the Snoke dude
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.160]  and maybe this girl likes him
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.160]  and like, you know, he's making a connection here
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  and like, so he knows what he wants to happen
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160]  in general, but specifically,
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.160]  like part of the reason his plan was successful
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.160]  is that he hadn't been thinking about it
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]  for six months leading up to this,
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:39.160]  like that he came up with it on the spot
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.160]  and that he was able to be disciplined
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.160]  for like 35 seconds
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.160]  of just thinking in sort of non-specific generalities
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.160]  about rotating lightsabers and lighting it up.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.160]  And I thought that was very deftly handled
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.160]  in contrast to the canto byte thread
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:54.160]  of like, you know, not deftly handled
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.160]  in the finest possible details of execution.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:00.160]  Okay, but let's not contrast those.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160]  I agree.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.160]  Let's not contrast them so much.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.160]  That scene was one of my favorite scenes
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.160]  in all of the Star Wars
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:13.160]  for a lot of the reasons that you've laid out.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.160]  I really, really dislike Calloran.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.160]  He's a bad guy.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.160]  To me, he reeks of this men's rights advocacy.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.160]  I think it's got to be intentional.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.160]  He's awful.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.160]  He's a bad guy.
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  I mean, he's nagging her.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.160]  He's doing the typical abuser thing of saying,
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.160]  nobody cares about you but me.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.160]  You're a nobody.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.160]  I'm literally the only person in the galaxy
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.160]  who thinks you're not a nobody,
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.160]  so you have to stay with me.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.160]  That's exactly what that, yeah.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.160]  But I think he's painted in a more sympathetic light
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:47.160]  because I feel in this movie very strongly
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.160]  that what Calloran wants ultimately
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.160]  is a connection with somebody.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160]  Yes.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.160]  Because he doesn't like,
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.160]  he's looking for that connection
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.160]  and he like, he failed to like,
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.160]  once the falling out with Luke and everything,
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.160]  he failed to have it with his idol, Luke.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.160]  His parents like sent him off to Jedi boarding school
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.160]  and so he's getting a little distance from them.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.160]  Plus he's a sullen teenager, right?
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.160]  His boss and his coworkers are mean to him, right?
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]  He just wants a connection.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.160]  He just wants a friend.
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.160]  That's the whole hand touching thing,
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.160]  which I think was very effective of like,
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.160]  Calloran is just looking for a connection
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.160]  and every time he can't get them,
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.160]  then he resorts to the pick up artist strategy
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:25.160]  of just being like terrible and negative
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.160]  and Ray's having none of that,
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.160]  so that's not gonna work.
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160]  The finger touch thing
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  was one of my favorite shots in the movie.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.160]  It's like I could practically feel it.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:35.160]  It was like, I don't know.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160]  And Ray's looking for a connection too.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.160]  She's got a bunch of friends and stuff as well,
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.160]  but she's looking for this connection
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.160]  to this wider world of the force, right?
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.160]  And Luke is not really given to her
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.160]  because he's kind of like yelling at her
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.160]  about the Jedi and everything and she's like,
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:48.160]  but we gotta win this thing.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.160]  I gotta help my friends.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.160]  She's better off than Kylo,
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.160]  which is why she's able to resist him
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.160]  and when he goes like, nobody cares about you but me,
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.160]  he's like, no, that's not true.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.160]  I've got friends.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.160]  Screw you, Kylo.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:50:59.160]  And so she's out of there.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.160]  One thing I think we should bring up about this movie
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:08.160]  is how visually daring it is for a Star Wars movie.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  Oh, God, it's brilliant.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.160]  It's visually daring in ways that make sense
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.160]  if you think about the huge influence
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:18.160]  of a Kurosawa movies on the original trilogy
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.160]  and westerns, right?
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.160]  And this movie also references a lot of,
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:26.160]  you know, Kurosawa movies again,
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.160]  but also Japanese animation.
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.160]  I'm amazed at how many articles I see
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.160]  talking about the light speed thing
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.160]  that don't mention the word anime
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.160]  because that whole shot is straight out of anime.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.160]  How many times has the anime done
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:42.160]  like that exact silent, low contrast
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.160]  inverted black and white thing with the boom app?
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.160]  It's still beautiful.
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:49.160]  Have you seen this thing that AMC theaters
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:51.160]  are putting up a thing before the movie now?
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.160]  To tell people the sound isn't broken?
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.160]  The sound is not broken.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160]  There's a scene in this movie,
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.160]  I don't even know what it says exactly,
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.160]  but it's like the sound is not broken
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.160]  no matter what you think
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:03.160]  because apparently there's so many people
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.160]  who are so cinematically ignorant
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.160]  that they don't get the silence of that.
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.160]  Yeah, I mean, you don't expect most people
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]  to have this reference
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.160]  because only if you're an anime nerd
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.160]  have you seen this a million times,
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.160]  and to be clear...
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:17.160]  No, no, in the prequels, they did this.
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:18.160]  They did the silent thing?
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.160]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:23.160]  Boba Fett or Jango Fett.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.160]  No, that was just the travel time distance
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160]  of light and sound difference.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.160]  They did do that, but that's not the same as this.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.160]  No, no, no.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.160]  I was sitting in the cinema,
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.160]  the sound cuts out.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  The poster, you mean?
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.160]  I thought you meant the actual...
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.160]  No, not the poster.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.160]  Like, Jango Fett drops a bomb.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:41.160]  There is about...
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.160]  It's less silent.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.160]  It's less...
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.160]  That's just the travel time distance
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:45.160]  of light and sound,
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.160]  like the same way you hear the thunder
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.160]  of YouTube lighting before you hear the thunder.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:51.160]  There's no sound place.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.160]  Cinematically, though, it has the same effect.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.160]  Exactly.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:55.160]  But it's not the same.
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:57.160]  The anime effect is a very specific thing.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.160]  I'm surprised people haven't done compilations
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.160]  on YouTube of like,
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.160]  look at this exact scene in anime a million times.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.160]  It's always about some large...
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:04.160]  Well, I'm sorry to try to say
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.160]  something nice about the prequels, but...
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:10.160]  It's a different, slightly different reference.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:12.160]  And like I said, to be clear,
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.160]  this is exactly what great movies do,
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.160]  is they are inspired by other great movies
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.160]  and they incorporate them.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.160]  And the reason The Last Jedi is interesting
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.160]  is it incorporates some new influences
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:23.160]  in terms of filmmaking and shots.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:26.160]  I mean, the scenes where they cut away from Rey
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:28.160]  and they have like a time-lapse photography
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.160]  of plants growing.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.160]  You've never seen that in a Star Wars movie.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.160]  No.
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.160]  You've seen it in other movies,
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.160]  but it's a cinematic language
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:37.160]  that has not previously been brought into Star Wars
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.160]  bringing into it.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.160]  So it's broadening the horizon of the kinds of shots
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:43.160]  you can expect to see in a Star Wars movie.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.160]  I can't agree with you more,
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:48.160]  and one of my favorite things about the Bond franchise
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:54.160]  is that the opening sort of credits
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  are non-literal filmmaking.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:00.160]  You can do whatever the hell you want in those credits.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:02.160]  As long as they're silhouettes of women.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.160]  Well, okay.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.160]  Sure, that's the trope.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:09.160]  But...
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:11.160]  And guns.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.160]  I mean, at least to me, it's like,
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.160]  look, this is a visual thing
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.160]  that we can sort of divorce ourselves
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.160]  from trying to tell the narrative,
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.160]  even though they kind of tell the narrative.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:27.160]  But it's divorced from the actual characters
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.160]  doing something in a scene.
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:30.160]  It's non-literal.
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:32.160]  Non-literal, yeah.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.160]  And I really, really admire them for doing that,
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:37.160]  and they've stuck to that for, I don't know,
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  30 years? More?
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:42.160]  I thought that the footage of the foliage growing,
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.160]  the grass growing in time lapse,
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:46.160]  and it was beautiful, too.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  It's key, but it immediately made me think
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.160]  that it was of Terrence Malick.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:53.160]  Yeah, he does a lot of that stuff.
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:56.160]  I mean, his movies have kind of devolved
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:58.160]  into nothing but that stuff,
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.160]  and I still love it.
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.160]  I should someday do a whole show about his movies,
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.160]  and I love the whole, like, talk about a guy
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.160]  who went into exile for 30 years,
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.160]  made some of the most beautiful, powerful movies
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.160]  in the late 70s ever made,
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.160]  and then just disappeared for 30 years,
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:18.160]  and then came back and started making a movie
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.160]  every couple of years.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:21.160]  But his movies have kind of devolved
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:22.160]  into nothing but that stuff.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.160]  But if you've never seen, like,
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.160]  probably the most approachable of his recent movies
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.160]  would be The Thin Red Line.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.160]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.160]  It's this war movie, and there's just,
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:35.160]  in the midst of this tense Pacific World War II drama,
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:38.160]  there's just beautiful shots of birds and trees
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160]  and stuff like that.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.160]  And you know what?
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.160]  Very few helicopters flying over rice paddies
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  with, like, Rolling Stones flying.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.160]  But anyway, I thought that was cool,
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.160]  and it's both beautiful.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.160]  I thought it was cinematically daring, as you said,
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.160]  and it felt like this is what they're saying
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.160]  the Force is about.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.160]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.160]  One second.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:07.160]  Syracuse, you mentioned the plants growing slowly thing,
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:10.160]  and I kind of want to call that out.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:11.160]  They're growing faster, yeah.
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:12.160]  Yeah, no.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:17.160]  And do you have the name of the movie on your mind?
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.160]  Oh, that's been in a million movies.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:21.160]  I mean, that shot is a trope in itself.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.160]  I mean, I'm sure it's been in Terrence Mann.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.160]  The Tree of Life probably had, like, seven times.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.160]  I don't know.
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:27.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:28.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.160]  I'll look it up.
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.160]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.160]  But there's a specific movie about, like,
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.160]  that very slow motion kind of stuff happening.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.160]  Kianus Katzi?
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.160]  Yes.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.160]  That's exactly what I was looking for.
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.160]  That's the whole movie of that type of stuff, yeah.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.160]  Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  I thought you mentioned that, and I wanted to call it out,
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.160]  because I think people should watch that.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.160]  Yeah, that's a weird one.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.160]  Some of the other references, like the throne room,
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.160]  the look of the throne room.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:52.160]  I wasn't totally on board with the look of the throne room.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.160]  Some people love it, some people don't.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.160]  But in the end, it's an aesthetic choice,
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:56.160]  and they went with it.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.160]  My main complaint with the throne room is,
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.160]  unfortunately, I think they do things a little bit,
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.160]  not in the wrong order, but mechanically speaking,
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.160]  once you kill Snoke, I don't feel like there's any reason
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.160]  for the red guys to fight anybody.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.160]  And I know they want to have a fight scene,
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  and the fight scene is cool, and I appreciate that.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.160]  But I lose the plot thread of, like,
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  why these red guys fighting again?
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.160]  They should be bailing.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:18.160]  Because once Snoke's dead, they're out of there, right?
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.160]  I don't see that they would have any loyalty.
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.160]  Like, once the emperor's dead,
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.160]  Luke didn't have to deal with the royal guards.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160]  And I didn't care about this red guys.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.160]  They have no characters.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.160]  They literally have no faces.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.160]  I don't care about them at all.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.160]  They're disposable.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.160]  I know you want to see Kylo and Rey fight.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.160]  You can get that in a different way.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  I think they needed to structure that a little bit differently.
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:41.160]  So I'm not as engaged in that fight as I could be.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.160]  I thought that the fight clearly only served to get Rey
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.160]  and Kylo into conflict without having them fight
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.160]  because they just came up to beat Snoke.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:53.160]  Yeah, they needed to have each other's back.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.160]  You needed the moment when they joined forces against a common enemy.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:58.160]  It just so happens that the common enemy they joined forces against
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:59.160]  is kind of nonsensical.
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.160]  Like, it doesn't work in the movie.
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:03.160]  First of all, I don't care about these red guys.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.160]  And second of all, as much as I do care about them
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.160]  and I understand them,
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:08.160]  I don't believe that they have a particular motivation
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.160]  to fight these guys,
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:11.160]  nor do I think they would be a match for these guys, right?
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.160]  So I don't know what you do to fix that,
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:15.160]  but I understand them wanting those moments,
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.160]  but I feel like the red guys were...
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.160]  Other people disagree.
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.160]  Other people love it,
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:21.160]  but nobody cares about those damn red guys.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.160]  I don't even know what they're called.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.160]  I enjoyed watching the fight,
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.160]  and I do think that, I don't even know,
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:30.160]  what, eight red guys versus two...
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.160]  Maybe.
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.160]  They would have ripped them to shreds.
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:34.160]  Could have happened.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:39.160]  But in terms of motivation,
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:44.160]  it leaves me wanting a little bit more explanation
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:46.160]  as to why they would do that.
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:48.160]  Yeah, but the choreography and the lighting
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.160]  in that fight scene was also the departure,
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:51.160]  and it's part of the things I don't like.
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.160]  It kind of looked like a 60s Hollywood musical.
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.160]  Oh, it was beautiful.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.160]  Like, it was very, very well lit.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.160]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:58.160]  And the big backdrop,
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:00.160]  and I like the fact that they burned the backdrop,
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.160]  which is a cool look.
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.160]  But it was very strange for a Star Wars movie.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.160]  I loved it.
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.160]  Yes.
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:10.160]  And I like, here's the thing.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:12.160]  I know that as a movie,
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.160]  this falls short in any number of ways,
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.160]  but the chances it takes,
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:24.160]  given the strictures it could have been under,
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.160]  amaze me.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:28.160]  And this throne room being all red
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.160]  and the visuals of this,
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:33.160]  it blows my mind.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.160]  What have they done in the musical though?
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.160]  I'm incredibly impressed with this music screen.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.160]  What if they made the musical number?
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.160]  That would be even more daring.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.160]  Just in the middle of Star Wars
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:41.160]  is a musical number where our Kylo and Rey sing
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.160]  during this whole fight.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.160]  Yeah, well, I'll send you this Star Wars,
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:49.160]  Star Wars musical Christmas.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:51.160]  Go through some more of the references.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.160]  The Luke, the Phantom Luke Kylo battle,
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:57.160]  straight references to anime tropes
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.160]  of heels sliding in the dirt
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:02.160]  and the exact shot choices of people running
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.160]  towards each other.
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.160]  I know it's like, you know,
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:09.160]  it's Kurosawa, but anime,
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:11.160]  Kurosawa's shots during those battles
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:12.160]  are not the same.
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.160]  Anime shots of choosing the show,
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:15.160]  the two people running at each other
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:17.160]  and choosing which shots you show,
[02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:18.160]  show the foot, show the person,
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:19.160]  show the eyes, show that like,
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.160]  it's straight up an anime trope.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.160]  And again, I love it for that, right?
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.160]  And I love the fact that a lot of people
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:26.160]  are seeing it who have no idea it's an anime trope,
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.160]  but just think it's cool because it is cool.
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:30.160]  Like this is what I love about Tarantino movies,
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  that he brings all his influences into his movie making,
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.160]  even if it's not the same genre.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.160]  So I want more of this.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.160]  I want more directors who are enthusiastic
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:40.160]  about other genres and other ways
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:42.160]  of visual storytelling to bring all that into Star Wars
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.160]  because I think it can support it.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:45.160]  Right.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:46.160]  So you've mentioned earlier in Syracuse
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:51.160]  that you mentioned earlier that it's a,
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.160]  I guess, Star Wars tradition to have like,
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.160]  you know, and elsewhere in science fiction as well,
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.160]  but you know, Hoth is the ice planet
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:03.160]  and Endor is the forest moon and Krayt is the salt planet.
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:08.160]  Like I love, that's such a clever way to get another,
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.160]  you know, like you're running out of climates, right?
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:12.160]  Like there's, they've had an ocean planet,
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.160]  they've had this, they've had that.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.160]  The salt planet is a pretty cool idea
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.160]  and the red ground underneath the white salt is-
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.160]  It's a planet design by an art director.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:23.160]  Exactly.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:25.160]  I give them a pass on it because it's cool.
[02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:28.160]  And I feel kind of bad for them because the 2000,
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:30.160]  the JJ, 2009 reboot of Star Trek
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:32.160]  already kind of did the red planet
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.160]  and I feel bad because like they kind of stole some,
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.160]  remember that one?
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:36.160]  Like the opening scene with like-
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:38.160]  With Kirk and-
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.160]  That was all red.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.160]  It's not the same red, it's not the same-
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.160]  Covered with the white.
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.160]  You know.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.160]  Yeah.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.160]  But anyway, the red stuff,
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:45.160]  I thought the red planet was cool.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.160]  I totally give them that.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:47.160]  I'm like, oh, the only reason they made it red
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:48.160]  is because it would be cool.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.160]  Yeah, that's why they made it red and it is cool.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:51.160]  So accept it.
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:52.160]  It's an alien world.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:54.160]  They can make up any ones they want.
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.160]  I have one last sponsor to thank,
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.160]  then we'll talk a little bit more
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:57.160]  and then we'll see if we have time
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.160]  to get Rian Johnson out of the green room.
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:00.160]  But I want to thank you.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:01.160]  I want to thank Backblaze.
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.160]  That green room is pretty packed back there,
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:03.160]  I got to tell you.
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:06.160]  Yeah, well, the problem might be that I have,
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:08.160]  it's an open bar.
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:09.160]  Yeah.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:11.160]  Backblaze, look, Backblaze offers
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:14.160]  unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.160]  and it's just five bucks a month per Mac or PC
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.160]  that you back up.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:21.160]  And it backs up all of your documents,
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:23.160]  your music, your photos, your videos,
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.160]  your drawings, your projects,
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.160]  everything that's your stuff all gets backed up.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:29.160]  There is no limit.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:30.160]  This is the thing people don't believe.
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.160]  Well, they think you say,
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.160]  well, yeah, but I got a four terabyte drive.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.160]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:36.160]  The only limit on how much you can back up
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  is the speed at which you can back it up.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:41.160]  You know, there's no magic way
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.160]  to make your four terabyte drive
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:45.160]  full of movies back up faster
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.160]  than your internet connection.
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:48.160]  But yeah, it's like whatever you've got
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.160]  connected to your machine, it gets backed up.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.160]  And then you can access your backup
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.160]  from anywhere in the world
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.160]  with another device where you sign into Backblaze,
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.160]  including like your phone.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:00.160]  You can get their app, you sign in,
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:02.160]  and then there's all of your stuff
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:03.160]  from your machine at home
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:06.160]  and you can get it and do whatever you want with it.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.160]  When catastrophe strikes,
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:10.160]  if something happens and you need to get a restore,
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:12.160]  you don't have to download the whole thing.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:13.160]  What you can do,
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:15.160]  if you need to like restore the entire thing,
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:16.160]  your entire backup,
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.160]  you can get it by purchasing a hard drive
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.160]  from Backblaze with all of your data on it
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.160]  and they'll overnight it to you by FedEx.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:27.160]  And after you get it back,
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:29.160]  you can return the drive to them
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.160]  and get a full refund.
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.160]  So if you don't need the drive,
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.160]  you can do that,
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:36.160]  have your entire backup delivered by FedEx.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.160]  The next day, send the drive back to them
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.160]  and they'll give you your money back for the drive.
[02:03:41.160 --> 02:03:43.160]  They've had over 20 billion files restored
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.160]  from their customers.
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:46.160]  It's gimmick free.
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.160]  There is no catch.
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:51.160]  It's five bucks a month per machine for full backups.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:55.160]  So go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.160]  They'll know where you came from
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:59.160]  and they'll continue to support the show
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:02.160]  and they have a 15 day free trial.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.160]  So you can go to backblaze.com slash sharing fireballs,
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:07.160]  fireball, sign up, install the software,
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.160]  see how good it is.
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.160]  Within the 15 days,
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.160]  your whole thing will be backed up.
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:13.160]  You can, you'll see how it works,
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:16.160]  the way that it's really non-disruptive to your Mac.
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.160]  It doesn't make your CPU go hot or anything like that.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.160]  Go try it out for a 15 day free trial.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.160]  My thanks to Backblaze for sponsoring
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.160]  this Star Wars holiday spectacular.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.160]  Just to save you from-
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.160]  Little known fact.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:33.160]  I want to mention that we did look up
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:34.160]  while during one of these ad reads
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.160]  that the movie we were trying to get the reference
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.160]  for that big zoom shot in Cantobite
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:42.160]  is the 1927 silent movie Wings.
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:43.160]  Okay.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.160]  We have it in the show notes.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.160]  And you're responsible for that.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.160]  I just want people to feel bad.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.160]  And after they tweet you,
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:50.160]  after I tweeted the movie Wings
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:52.160]  and they keep listening to this podcast,
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.160]  eventually they're going to hear me say this and go,
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:54.160]  Oh, I should have kept listening.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:55.160]  That's right.
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.160]  You should.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.160]  Yeah.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:04:59.160]  This is like a battleship Potemkin moment where you're,
[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.160]  yeah, you really want to call it that.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.160]  Little known fact,
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:09.160]  R2-D2 was actually built by Backblaze.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:10.160]  Does it make sense that R2,
[02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:13.160]  that Luke didn't take R2 with him to,
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:14.160]  what's the name of that planet?
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.160]  Oc-2?
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:17.160]  Who cares?
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.160]  It's Luke's world.
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:20.160]  That's fine.
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:22.160]  I don't think he's ever mentioned in the movie,
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:23.160]  so who cares?
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.160]  I thought that you needed an astromech droid
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.160]  to do the hyperspace stuff with an X-wing.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.160]  Yeah.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:29.160]  I don't know.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.160]  Maybe he got him there and gave him a shuttle back.
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:32.160]  I don't know.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.160]  Yeah, R2 is one of those characters
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.160]  that gets cut a little bit.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.160]  And honestly,
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:41.160]  I'm fine to see 3PO and R2 fade off into the sunset
[02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:43.160]  with the rest of the old characters.
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:44.160]  You can give them cameos and stuff,
[02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:47.160]  but they're not the stars of this show.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:48.160]  Yeah.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.160]  Do you think BB-8 has a little bit too much of a role, though,
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.160]  like BB-8 driving an AT-ST?
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.160]  Yeah, they're giving the people what they want.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.160]  I give it mostly a pat.
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:56.160]  I know some people are bothered by that.
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:58.160]  Honestly, it did not occur to me to be bothered by that at all
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:02.160]  because I feel like BB-8's character,
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:05.160]  unlike R2 and 3PO for that matter,
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.160]  BB-8 has always been a little bit of an action hero.
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.160]  He's more dynamic
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:11.160]  because he's not limited by the special effects,
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:13.160]  so maybe it's a little bit silly.
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.160]  And speaking of more stuff that could get cut,
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:20.160]  like Phasma and Finn's arc of getting vengeance on Phasma
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.160]  for being mean to him.
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:22.160]  I'm okay with that,
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.160]  but why the hell is BB-8 riding an AT-ST?
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:29.160]  Why is Phasma coming back to fight?
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:33.160]  Phasma is kind of like the Boba Fett,
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:38.160]  but they knew how popular Boba Fett would be.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:42.160]  I think the media cycle was too slow in the original trilogy,
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.160]  that fans were all hyped about Boba Fett,
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:48.160]  but the movies treated him not badly,
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:50.160]  but he didn't have that much screen time,
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:52.160]  whereas nowadays people know how,
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.160]  we're going to make a new Boba Fett,
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:56.160]  and we know how cool Phasma is,
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:57.160]  and we know how much people love BB-8
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:58.160]  because in this information economy,
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:01.160]  we know exactly how much toys they're buying from it.
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:05.160]  So I felt like they needed to put that in the movie,
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.160]  and you can make that work, but this is a busy movie.
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.160]  There's a lot of people doing things,
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.160]  and honestly, you don't have time
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:13.160]  to establish why anyone should care about Phasma
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:16.160]  and remembering back to Finn's deal with him,
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.160]  and then BB-8 doing a weird heroic thing.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:20.160]  BB-8 got enough hero moments.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:21.160]  He's shooting coins at people.
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:23.160]  He's shoving his head against a panel,
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.160]  which I think was, again,
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:28.160]  you want to make BB-8 do a funny thing to help the X-wing?
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.160]  I'm all on board with that.
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.160]  Once you get down to Brass Tacks
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.160]  and tell me how you're going to do it,
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:33.160]  I was on board with the little fingers in the dike too,
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:35.160]  but when he shoves his head against it?
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.160]  Yeah, I did too. I like that.
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.160]  I like that whole thing.
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:38.160]  He shoves his head, it doesn't make any sense.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.160]  I like that whole sequence.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.160]  I don't like it.
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:41.160]  It's like, I know what you're going for.
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.160]  Give a better punchline.
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:43.160]  A lot of things in this movie felt like,
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:45.160]  you know, get Joss Whedon in here
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.160]  to punch it up a little bit,
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.160]  because I'm totally on board with your joke.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.160]  It's a good droid joke.
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:53.160]  Just the punchline was just a little bit off, right?
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:56.160]  So yeah, they add ST, going around.
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:58.160]  I didn't mind that.
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:07:59.160]  I didn't think that's ridiculous
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:01.160]  because I believe BB-8 could totally do that,
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:04.160]  but is it a scene that advanced the plot
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:05.160]  or expanded anyone's character?
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:06.160]  No, of course not.
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:07.160]  Or did you just need some way
[02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:09.160]  to get those guys out of a jam?
[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.160]  Yeah.
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.160]  I thought, and you know,
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:18.160]  complaining about the whole Rose Finn thread,
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:22.160]  I felt like having one more thing come back
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:25.160]  to climax at that exact moment
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:29.160]  of Admiral Holdo, you know, light speeding
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:32.160]  into the cruiser to have their execution
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:34.160]  be seconds away at the same moment was just...
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:38.160]  Oh, no, no, their kiss was simultaneous
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:40.160]  with the door being breached on the base.
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:43.160]  Like, in the background when Rose kisses Finn,
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.160]  I thought this was good filmmaking.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:46.160]  Like, Rian Johnson has some good hero moments.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:50.160]  Like, when she kisses Finn,
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:52.160]  in the background, out of focus,
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:54.160]  is the door being breached by the big gun
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:55.160]  that Finn was trying to fly into.
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:57.160]  Oh, I don't have a complaint with that.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:59.160]  I'm saying when they were on the ship
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:00.160]  and they were ready to be executed,
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:02.160]  I think it was too much that it was the exact...
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:05.160]  It was movie-making coincidence time.
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.160]  But then it didn't make any sense afterwards,
[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:10.160]  where they were laying where they were laying
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:12.160]  and nobody else who was around them was around them.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:13.160]  Everyone who was standing up was killed.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.160]  Like, it's a lot of...
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:16.160]  You give a movie a lot of these things.
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:18.160]  You're like, I give you that, I give you that,
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.160]  but eventually you feel like you've used your budget
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:24.160]  of how much movie coincidence I'm willing to give you,
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.160]  how much plot flab I'm willing to allow.
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:29.160]  That's another thing.
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:32.160]  So Finn, this is another arc of the movie
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.160]  of people and their resistance learning lessons
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:37.160]  and perhaps those lessons being taught on the job
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.160]  in a way that is not appropriately respectful
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.160]  of the lives of the people who are part of the training program.
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:45.160]  Like, let's teach Poe to be a good leader
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.160]  by having a bunch of people be killed.
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:48.160]  But anyway, Finn is flying towards the big gun.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.160]  He's like, I'm going to sacrifice myself.
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:54.160]  Lots of nerd complaints about details of the movie.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.160]  Like, why is the steel melting on his guns
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:58.160]  but his face isn't melting?
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:09:59.160]  It's fine.
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:00.160]  The pot is off to the left.
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.160]  The guns are in the path of the beam.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:03.160]  The pot isn't, like, whatever.
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.160]  I don't have a problem.
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.160]  I do not have nerd problems.
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.160]  You can get nerd problems with anything in the movie,
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.160]  but once you're picking on nerd problems,
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:11.160]  there's obviously something bigger going on that's the problem.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.160]  So I'm not concentrating on those.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.160]  But the main thrust of that is,
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.160]  was Rose right to knock Finn off course?
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:21.160]  Because clearly the movie wants you to think
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:23.160]  that she is right because it says,
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:24.160]  they give her a letter, have a speech,
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.160]  and say, this is the way we win,
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:29.160]  not by, you know, destroying the things we hate,
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:31.160]  but by saving the things that we love, and I love you,
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:33.160]  and that's why I saved you.
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:36.160]  My read on the movie is that the movie is trying to communicate,
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:38.160]  and I believe that if Finn flew into that big gun,
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.160]  it would have done nothing because he's a little ship,
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:44.160]  and he's flying into a big hot thing that's probably pretty sturdy.
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:45.160]  And even if it hadn't fired,
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:47.160]  even if he flew into it before it fired,
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:49.160]  he's not going to stop that damn gun.
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.160]  And even if he did stop the gun,
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.160]  they would just bring another one down.
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:54.160]  Like, it would have actually been a useless gesture
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.160]  in that Finn was just trying to be like,
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:57.160]  no, we've got to win, we've got to beat him.
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:59.160]  And his arc, as silly as it might be,
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.160]  was like to learn not to be all like,
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:02.160]  you've got to beat everybody.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.160]  He'd already beaten Phasma,
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:06.160]  so it's tough to have him doing something pig-headed again,
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.160]  but really it's part of Rose's arc
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:11.160]  to showing her being more level-headed and say,
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.160]  don't be an idiot, Finn.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:15.160]  Like, we need you on the Resistance,
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.160]  and what you're doing now is dumb,
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:18.160]  and Poe has figured it out.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.160]  He learned his little arc after millions of people died
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.160]  to be like, let's not do the suicide mission
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:24.160]  to be the hero.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.160]  Let's preserve what we have left.
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:28.160]  Again, I think Poe's arc is also very ham-fisted
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:30.160]  and maybe not as sort of mature and believable
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:31.160]  as it could be,
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.160]  but I'm mostly on board with Rose being right,
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.160]  that Finn was being stupid,
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:38.160]  and that Rose was being smart,
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.160]  and that is Rose's hero moment
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.160]  of her saving Finn from himself
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:45.160]  and getting the smooch before she passes out.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:48.160]  I agree completely.
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:53.160]  Poe's arc is, I mean,
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.160]  we should probably talk about that,
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.160]  but that's not good.
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.160]  On-the-job training, like a different time.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.160]  Use a simulator like a star.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.160]  A little bit of on-the-job training,
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:04.160]  but for Finn, let's stick to Finn.
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.160]  His character has always been about running away, right?
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:11.160]  And this was the one time that he thought,
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:15.160]  like, I'm gonna die in service of these people,
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:18.160]  and it was dumb.
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:20.160]  He picked a dumb time to do it.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:22.160]  He's not just running away.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.160]  He always seems like a man out of place.
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:28.160]  His place was in the First Order,
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:30.160]  but he's not down with that,
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.160]  and he wants to be part of the Resistance,
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.160]  but in The Force Awakens,
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:36.160]  he's play-acting to being part of the Resistance
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.160]  that he would like to be,
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.160]  but he's not really.
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:39.160]  Now he's really part of the Resistance,
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.160]  but he doesn't quite know how to do that,
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:42.160]  because he's still like,
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.160]  the First Order is gonna get us,
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.160]  and he's kind of a bit of a confused character
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:48.160]  that they haven't nailed down,
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.160]  which is fine.
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:51.160]  He can be kind of counter-shot,
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:53.160]  but the movie doesn't quite know what to do with him.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.160]  They know he's got charisma,
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:56.160]  and he's got chemistry,
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.160]  and he's really into Rey.
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.160]  This movie, they derail him to say,
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.160]  you're not really into Rey.
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:01.160]  She's just like your first friend.
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:02.160]  Rey's not into you,
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:05.160]  so when Rey sees Finn with Rose,
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.160]  Rey is like, oh, that's good.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.160]  Those two should get together,
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.160]  because I'm totally not into Finn.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:11.160]  Well, yeah, okay, so forget about that,
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:14.160]  but the point I'm trying to make
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:16.160]  is that previously,
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.160]  when confronted with a problem,
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.160]  Finn has tried to escape it,
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.160]  and yet this was the first one
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:27.160]  where he could put his life on the line
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.160]  and try to take down that adat.
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:32.160]  It's like he overcompensated.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.160]  He fought off Kylo Ren.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:35.160]  Yeah, it's like he overcompensated
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.160]  in a really dumb way.
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.160]  What about in The Force Awakens?
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:40.160]  He defends Rey from Kylo Ren.
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.160]  He's willing to attack.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.160]  It's his hatred.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.160]  The message in there is that he's totally like,
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.160]  we can't let them win.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:46.160]  The First Order is evil.
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:47.160]  We've got to beat them.
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.160]  Poe is ready to peel off,
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.160]  and he's like, no, no.
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:51.160]  He really hates The First Order
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:53.160]  from his dramatic experience with them.
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:55.160]  But in The Force Awakens,
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:56.160]  he did it for Rey,
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:57.160]  and in this movie,
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:00.160]  he did it for people he didn't even know,
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.160]  or at least he tried to do it.
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:04.160]  I think that that's a bit of his arc
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:05.160]  going from Rey.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:09.160]  I think he did arguably do some good,
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:14.160]  because he did soften up Kylo Ren a little bit.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.160]  Yeah.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:16.160]  All right.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:20.160]  I liked the Luke Skywalker climax,
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.160]  and I will admit,
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:26.160]  and I think I am a pretty astute watcher of films
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.160]  and noticer of things
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:32.160]  and detector of, oh, I see where they're going,
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.160]  and I have to admit I was completely fooled.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:35.160]  I was completely fooled, too,
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.160]  and I think part of the reason we were both fooled...
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:38.160]  I believed it.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.160]  I believed every moment of it,
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.160]  even after Kylo Ren runs him through with a lightsaber.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.160]  I was like, man, he's really good.
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:48.160]  Yeah, you're still trying to figure it out
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.160]  of what he's like.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.160]  Yeah, I really thought he was that good.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:52.160]  I honestly did.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:53.160]  Here's the thing.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.160]  I think part of the reason, at least for me,
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:56.160]  I'll just speak for myself,
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:58.160]  but maybe possibly this is true for Jon as well.
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:00.160]  The reason I was so easily fooled,
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.160]  A, I think it's done pretty well.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.160]  It's done well enough
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:05.160]  that a lot of people are going to be fooled,
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:07.160]  but B, I was 100% engaged
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.160]  in watching what was going to happen with Luke,
[02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:11.160]  because I have a vested interest in Luke.
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.160]  Luke is important in my life,
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.160]  and so when he finally shows up for his climactic battle,
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:18.160]  and here's the thing.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.160]  When they fire all the guns at him...
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.160]  What's he going to do?
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:23.160]  Pick up a laser sword and take down the whole empire?
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.160]  When they fire all the guns at him,
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.160]  I thought it was comical and it was ridiculous,
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:28.160]  but already my brain was like,
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:29.160]  but how can this be explained?
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:32.160]  Well, he could maybe make a force shield around him,
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:34.160]  and we don't know how strong he really is.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:35.160]  Who cares?
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.160]  I wasn't even willing to accept the data
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:39.160]  my brain was giving me about Luke,
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:42.160]  to say this is ridiculous, right?
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.160]  And I continued to buy it after the onslaught of blaster fire,
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.160]  because they didn't show it,
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.160]  and I thought, that's brilliant.
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:50.160]  Don't show me him...
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.160]  Yeah, he's not deflecting anything.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:54.160]  Deflecting all the beams or anything.
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:55.160]  Right.
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:58.160]  Or show me that he dug a hole or whatever.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.160]  Just have it be a cloud,
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.160]  and have him come out and dust his shoulder,
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.160]  and it's like...
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:05.160]  I was so in it.
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.160]  Because we're all so invested in Luke,
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:09.160]  and we're willing to go with literally almost anything,
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.160]  and I thought it was great,
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.160]  because this is another great pull the rug out of like,
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:15.160]  it perfectly explains the ridiculousness instantly,
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:17.160]  and it's an amazing win for Luke.
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:19.160]  When they showed him floating over that thing,
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:20.160]  it was like, yes,
[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:23.160]  because that's what people wanted from Yoda in the prequels.
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:25.160]  They didn't want him fighting with lightsaber,
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.160]  they wanted him being smart.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:28.160]  Work smarter, not harder.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.160]  Luke, it was an amazing triumph by not fighting,
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.160]  which is totally on brand for Luke.
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:37.160]  Yes, and that's what I wanted to say at the beginning,
[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.160]  is that Luke wins again,
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.160]  a massive victory,
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:47.160]  without lifting his lightsaber even once.
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:48.160]  Right.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.160]  And the crazy part,
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.160]  there were so many clues,
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.160]  and the little thing just broke in half like ten minutes ago.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.160]  Yeah, and nothing makes sense,
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:57.160]  but I was just like...
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:59.160]  He's got the wrong lightsaber.
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:02.160]  Now, I don't blame myself for missing this,
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:03.160]  but he doesn't leave footprints.
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:04.160]  Yeah, I don't blame myself for missing that either,
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:05.160]  but it's nice.
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:06.160]  That's cool.
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.160]  But the lightsaber...
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:10.160]  That's part of the anime thing that Surik is saying.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.160]  He's got the just for men covering up the gray in his beard,
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:14.160]  he got a haircut,
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160]  he lost some weight,
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:17.160]  he looks better.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.160]  I didn't notice any of that at first.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.160]  And the reason I didn't notice this,
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.160]  remember the scene that precedes this is him with Leia,
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.160]  and that is an emotionally charged scene,
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:25.160]  because Carrie Fisher is dead now,
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.160]  and because every line in that scene could also be read
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:28.160]  as Mark Hamill talking to Carrie Fisher,
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.160]  as well as Luke talking to Leia,
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.160]  and it's an incredibly emotional scene.
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:34.160]  Here's me chiming in with,
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:36.160]  if they had hired me and they said,
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:40.160]  John Gruber, here's the screenplay to The Last Jedi,
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.160]  we're only going to take one note from you.
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.160]  And I could give one note.
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:47.160]  If I could only give one note on the whole movie,
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:49.160]  my note would have been that,
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.160]  play that scene where Luke comes out of the shadow,
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:55.160]  Leia senses his presence and is aware of it
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:57.160]  before anybody else is,
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:59.160]  and there he is, and they make eye contact,
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.160]  and there's a moment,
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.160]  and then the first words of their interaction,
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.160]  I would have said that Luke says to Leia,
[02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:09.160]  I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.160]  Yeah, that would have been good.
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:13.160]  I think it would have brought the house down.
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.160]  And you know, I'm not an actor,
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.160]  I can't do it the right way.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.160]  Hamill could have done it.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.160]  Just do it the right way,
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.160]  where he knows, and she knows,
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:23.160]  and he knows that she knows.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:26.160]  Because they did that so many times in The Force Awakens,
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:28.160]  and all sorts of sly references that,
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:30.160]  it would have worked.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:32.160]  If I had to have a good note on that scene,
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:33.160]  I would have been like,
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.160]  the dice is a touchstone for Han.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:37.160]  Works because the dice were there in Star Wars and everything,
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.160]  but they were never featured prominently in the movie,
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:41.160]  and I don't think anybody except for super fans
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:43.160]  even knows they were there,
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.160]  and so maybe find a different touchstone for Han
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:46.160]  other than the dice,
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:49.160]  but I guess they basically established the dice in this movie
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:51.160]  because he pulls them off the lightning falcon
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:52.160]  and we believe it there,
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:54.160]  but it wasn't something that resonated back through the original trilogy.
[02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:57.160]  Again, even though those dice were there in the original trilogy,
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:00.160]  they were like blurry on a standard VHS copy that,
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:02.160]  you know, we never really saw them,
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:05.160]  so I'm not sure that landed that well.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.160]  And the rules about force projection,
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.160]  and you can give Leia a kiss
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:14.160]  and put a physical object in her hand that's not really there,
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.160]  but he doesn't leave footprints because that's the clever hint.
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:18.160]  It's like, what are the rules about force projection?
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:20.160]  Do you interact with the physical world when you're there?
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160]  Do you not?
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.160]  Is it entirely inside people's heads?
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:26.160]  Then if it's in people's heads, then how do the droids see them?
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.160]  Force projection is too new for us to know exactly how it works,
[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:31.160]  but that's another thing about this movie.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:34.160]  Mechanically speaking, they tried to establish
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:36.160]  both that force projection is a thing
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.160]  and that it's really hard and it might kill you.
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.160]  They tried to establish that earlier in the movie
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:44.160]  with dialogue between Kylo and Rey,
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:47.160]  and I felt that was slightly clumsily done.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.160]  Like, they did the right thing to try to establish,
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.160]  but it wasn't exact.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:55.160]  Even on two viewings, I feel like it wasn't clearly established enough.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:57.160]  I get what they were going for,
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:00.160]  but the lines and the context and everything was a little clumsy,
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:02.160]  so you kind of had to back.
[02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.160]  I was like, oh, that's kind of what they were talking about before.
[02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:07.160]  Kylo says, oh, you can't be doing this. It would kill you.
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:09.160]  Exactly, and that's basically all you get,
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:12.160]  and it's not entirely clear that what they're doing is the same as what Luke does.
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:14.160]  It fits together.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.160]  It's a little bit shaky, like so many things.
[02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:26.160]  Also, Snoke's nonconsensual facetiming is weird.
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:29.160]  To get the idea that they are not choosing to do this,
[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:31.160]  again, they establish that by saying,
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.160]  I don't want to be doing this either.
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:34.160]  Is it a weird time for you?
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.160]  Now you're taking off your shirt.
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:38.160]  They do establish that someone else is connecting in.
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.160]  My theory is that that guy was hanging out with his shirt off all day
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.160]  just waiting for the call.
[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.160]  Well, when you look like that, you've got to find it.
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:50.160]  One of my favorite and most often quoted Stanley Kubrick quotes
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:55.160]  is that sometimes the truth of a thing isn't in the think of it,
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:56.160]  but in the feel of it,
[02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:01.160]  and I feel like that is the definition of any of the science in Star Wars.
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:07.160]  Of course, the worst possible thing in explaining things
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:10.160]  that shouldn't be explained was the whole midichlorians thing in the prequels
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:12.160]  where it's like, stop, stop, stop.
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.160]  Stop trying to tell me that this makes sense.
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:17.160]  It always felt like it made sense before.
[02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:18.160]  Leave it at that.
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:20.160]  Don't try to make it logical sense.
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:24.160]  And to me, Luke's force projection at the end,
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:26.160]  I don't care what the rules are.
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:28.160]  It works for me because I felt like it worked.
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:30.160]  I'm just saying another slight inconsistency,
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:32.160]  but yeah, it totally works for the feel.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.160]  I'm just saying, mechanically speaking,
[02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:37.160]  it would be better if the movie had more firmly established
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:39.160]  that force projection is a thing and what the costs are.
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:41.160]  And they did try to establish it,
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:43.160]  but it went by fast enough that you wouldn't.
[02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.160]  And they had plenty of time in those four scenes.
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.160]  And by the way, this is something I haven't heard anyone talk about,
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:49.160]  but I think it's one of the best.
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:51.160]  It's not like a scene.
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:53.160]  One of the best decisions, one of the most interesting things to me
[02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:55.160]  in this movie that I haven't heard anyone talk about
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:58.160]  is during the various force time conversations
[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:01.160]  between Rey and Kylo Ren,
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:08.160]  at one point, Rey is narrating her own descent into the big blowhole thing.
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:11.160]  I went down there and I saw this thing,
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:14.160]  and I thought, you know, she's doing a voiceover for herself.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.160]  She's obviously describing something after the fact, right?
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.160]  And it's long.
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:22.160]  She narrates it, she's talking about it, so on and so forth.
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:29.160]  And the reveal, which apparently was much more impactful to me
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:32.160]  than it was to anyone in the audience or anyone who has seen this movie,
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:36.160]  is the reveal is this long, drawn out, heart-to-heart conversation
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:39.160]  about what it was like in the big dark side blowhole thing
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.160]  is to Kylo Ren.
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:44.160]  And it seemed like she would be pouring her heart out to Luke.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:47.160]  That's the big reveal.
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:49.160]  And she's telling this to Kylo Ren,
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.160]  and that is the big turn in their relationship.
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:54.160]  Do you realize that she's not just an unwilling force time victim,
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:57.160]  because they go on for like three minutes
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:59.160]  in a very long scene with multiple shots,
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:01.160]  and you're embroiled in what's in the cave,
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.160]  but the big reveal is she's pouring her heart out.
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:05.160]  She's on the phone with Kylo Ren talking about this stuff,
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:08.160]  and I thought that was a great turn, great movie making,
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:10.160]  and apparently no one else cared about it,
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.160]  because in the two showings, no one gasped at it other than me.
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:16.160]  I haven't heard anyone talk about it.
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.160]  I thought that was great, a great way to communicate very strongly
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:23.160]  that the relationship between these two has changed.
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:27.160]  All right, on that point, I think it's an important point.
[02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:32.160]  Do you think that what Kylo Ren said to Rey about her parentage
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:35.160]  was the truth or not the truth?
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:36.160]  From a certain point of view.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.160]  I think it was the truth.
[02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:43.160]  I think that in their shared force time,
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:45.160]  his insight into her background,
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:49.160]  and I also feel like it's backed up on second viewing
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:51.160]  of him saying, you know it's true.
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.160]  You've known it all along, and you've just hidden it.
[02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:56.160]  Your parents were just losers on Jaco,
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.160]  and they sold you for drinking money,
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:01.160]  and I honest to God think that that's just the truth.
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.160]  I think the people who are holding on to the idea
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:07.160]  that she's a Skywalker or a Kenobi or whatever,
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:08.160]  you're missing the point,
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:11.160]  and I also feel like that's part of the way this trilogy
[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:15.160]  is trying to break forward, which is that...
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:17.160]  Anyone can be a Jedi.
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:20.160]  Right, and might be not just a Jedi,
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:24.160]  but like a key Jedi, a master Jedi for lack of a better term.
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:28.160]  I don't think anything about the entirety of Star Wars
[02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:29.160]  is against that.
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.160]  Maybe you could say the original trilogy was
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.160]  because of the whole Skywalker lineage thing,
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:35.160]  but the prequels are all about, hey,
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.160]  kids are born all the time that have force powers,
[02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:38.160]  and we seek them out
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:39.160]  and bring them to our Jedi boarding school,
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:41.160]  and so that's pretty firmly established
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:42.160]  that it can come from anywhere.
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.160]  It's just the original trilogy is so obsessed
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:46.160]  with the Clintons and the Bushes or whatever
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:50.160]  that we can't get out of our own way on the family stuff.
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:54.160]  Right, and to not fault the original trilogy,
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.160]  part of it is that there's only three or four
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:00.160]  force powerful people left in the galaxy,
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:01.160]  and two of them happen to be twins,
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:03.160]  and their father is one of the other survivors.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.160]  Yeah, so everyone ends up being related.
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:09.160]  So I think, well, here's the thing.
[02:25:09.160 --> 02:25:11.160]  There's the meta level where there's the danger of like,
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:13.160]  yeah, but maybe the next director will just decide,
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:15.160]  oh, actually, he was totally lying,
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:17.160]  and I want to make her a Kenobi or something, right?
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.160]  Because given how these first two movies have gone
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:22.160]  and how it seems like making sharp turns,
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:23.160]  who knows what could happen?
[02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:26.160]  But just saying in this movie as it is
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:27.160]  without worrying about what the next,
[02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:29.160]  what JJ's going to decide to do in the next one,
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:32.160]  and what maybe JJ had in his head from the beginning
[02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:34.160]  when he has like, Kenobi say Rey or whatever,
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.160]  I think what Kylo Ren is saying is true
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.160]  from a certain point of view in the same way
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:42.160]  that everything that they both believe in this movie
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:44.160]  comes true, but isn't really the truth of it.
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:46.160]  So he's saying it to be hurtful, right?
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:50.160]  I believe that her parents, my headcanon is
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:52.160]  that he's trying to make her feel bad.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.160]  Her parents weren't anybody important,
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:57.160]  but they didn't throw her away like garbage, right?
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.160]  That's the middle ground, I think, going back.
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:02.160]  So I'm on board with the idea that the kernel of truth
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.160]  is that you're not a Skywalker, you're not a Kenobi,
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160]  you're just a person.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:08.160]  But my impression from Seeing the Force Awakens
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:14.160]  is that her parents left her with this person
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.160]  and flew away, but that she did come from a loving family.
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:19.160]  Her hair was nicely braided,
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.160]  she looked like she was pretty clean,
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.160]  that her parents were either forced to give her up
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:24.160]  or she was kidnapped or whatever,
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:26.160]  and maybe her parents are dead in a pauper's grave
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.160]  and never could get her back or whatever.
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.160]  But the whole reason she's waiting for her parents
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:34.160]  to come back is because she has good memories of having parents.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:36.160]  She wasn't that young, she was like three or four.
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.160]  She misses her parents,
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:40.160]  she's calling to them as they fly away.
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.160]  So I believe her parents weren't just piece-of-crap drunks
[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:44.160]  who sold her for money.
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:46.160]  That's Kylo adding stuff to twist the knife.
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.160]  But I'm willing to believe, if the next director agrees with me,
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.160]  that it's okay and that it's reasonable for her
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.160]  not to be one of the important families
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:56.160]  that we know about.
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.160]  So I agree, and I mean,
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:06.160]  I can't help but put Kylo in the men's rights activist
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:08.160]  pick-up artist kind of category.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.160]  He's nagging her the whole time.
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:15.160]  And, you know, when he says your parents are nothing,
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.160]  you're nothing, you are meaningless except to me,
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:22.160]  that is a play that I don't,
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.160]  I fundamentally don't believe. I can't read that as being true.
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:33.160]  He is a villain, and what he is saying is villainous.
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:38.160]  Now, does that tell us who her parents are? No.
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:40.160]  And that's fine.
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.160]  I mean, could it be nobody's, maybe, as you said, probably,
[02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.160]  you know, could be people that were good people that had to leave.
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:54.160]  I'm a Kenobi fan.
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:58.160]  I would be happy if there was some relationship there.
[02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:02.160]  But, you know, my personal well-being,
[02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:08.160]  I would be happier if they did turn out
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.160]  not to be some sort of noble lineage,
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.160]  but was, in fact, a new Jedi.
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:16.160]  Yeah.
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:18.160]  And I think that would be great.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:21.160]  Well, I'll start her own family, give her her last name.
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:22.160]  Exactly.
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:24.160]  On the subject of midi-chlorians,
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:26.160]  I always find myself as the odd man out
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:28.160]  as being a weird defender of midi-chlorians
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:30.160]  as things that make sense,
[02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.160]  because the original trilogy firmly establishes
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:35.160]  that the Force is strong in your family.
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:36.160]  It's hereditary, right?
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:37.160]  Yeah.
[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.160]  The Force is 100% hereditary.
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:40.160]  The original trilogy makes no bones about that.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:43.160]  How can you have something that's hereditary that's not biological?
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.160]  Midi-chlorians are still stupid.
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.160]  You didn't need to put them in the movie.
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.160]  You don't need to explain them.
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:50.160]  But it does make some vague logical sense
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.160]  that if you're going to make some sort of thing
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:53.160]  that you can measure about someone
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:54.160]  with the strong of the Force,
[02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:56.160]  that it would be some kind of biological test.
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.160]  And it actually also makes sense
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.160]  that the only people who would know about this biological test
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:02.160]  was back when the Jedi were at their full strength
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:05.160]  and they were in the heart of their knowledge
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:06.160]  and it wasn't just like,
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:08.160]  people don't even believe a Jedi are real or whatever.
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:09.160]  Anyway, midi-chlorians are dumb.
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:10.160]  I don't like them.
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.160]  It doesn't even make any sense,
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:16.160]  because the idea is that, take the prequels,
[02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.160]  is that Anakin didn't even have a father,
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.160]  so the family started with him.
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.160]  Oh, don't even start with that.
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:21.160]  I can't handle it.
[02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:22.160]  I know, I know.
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:23.160]  It's terrible.
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:24.160]  I agree.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.160]  But the proof that the Force is strong in his family
[02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:31.160]  is just that he had one set of twins
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:32.160]  and they were both strong in the Force.
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:34.160]  Well, that's all it takes for hereditary stuff.
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:37.160]  Like, you got one set of professional baseball players
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.160]  and that's all.
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:40.160]  Like, Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi's kids
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.160]  are going to be good at tennis.
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:43.160]  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that.
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.160]  You should have gone for the Williams.
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:47.160]  Come on, man.
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:50.160]  Lucas, while still setting it up,
[02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:52.160]  after setting it up as hereditary,
[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:54.160]  Lucas then goes and, in the prequels,
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:58.160]  sets up the Jedi Order as a bunch of celibate monks.
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:02.160]  Like, if it's hereditary, why aren't they having kids?
[02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:05.160]  I'm just saying, like, the original trilogy,
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:06.160]  the Force is strong in my family.
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:07.160]  And that's the other thing.
[02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:09.160]  The Force Awakens, speaking of Rey's parentage,
[02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:13.160]  the Force Awakens trailers lean heavily on, you know,
[02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.160]  my father has it, my sister has it.
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:17.160]  Like, they lean so heavily on the idea
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:18.160]  that Rey's related to somebody,
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.160]  which, again, makes me have the fear
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:22.160]  that JJ really wanted Rey to be related to somebody,
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:24.160]  Ryan didn't, but JJ gets to have the last word.
[02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.160]  I think it's a red herring.
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:27.160]  I think it's a red herring
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:29.160]  and I have faith that there's no conflict
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:32.160]  between JJ Abrams and Ryan Johnson.
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:33.160]  That's what Vader said, too.
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.160]  We know that turned out.
[02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:35.160]  Oh, come on.
[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:40.160]  So my understanding is that Ryan already wrote the...
[02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:41.160]  Ryan, I call him Ryan.
[02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.160]  We call each other F.E. Thursday night.
[02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:44.160]  It's cool.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.160]  But my understanding is that he already laid out the plot
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:49.160]  for Episode Nine.
[02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.160]  And I know I've made this joke before,
[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:57.160]  but JJ's mystery boxes hold, like, Schrodinger's cats.
[02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:59.160]  I don't think he's...
[02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:02.160]  I don't think he's married to the idea
[02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:06.160]  of setting up a mystery that, you know,
[02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:08.160]  when revealed or when built upon,
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:12.160]  he rejects because that was not his original idea.
[02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:14.160]  Yeah, I'm sure he'll do what's needed,
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:15.160]  but I don't know.
[02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:16.160]  We'll see.
[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:17.160]  Like, you could make yet more turns,
[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:19.160]  but I think we were kind of tired
[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.160]  of being yanked around with the Rey thing.
[02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.160]  I think I should just go with what they established.
[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:23.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:24.160]  Yeah, then you should go.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:26.160]  No, but I think that's got to be solved.
[02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.160]  As, you know, what Luke was to the original trilogy,
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:31.160]  Rey clearly is to this trilogy.
[02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:34.160]  She is, you know, in a cast of dozens,
[02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:36.160]  and like you said, if anything,
[02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:38.160]  they're struggling with too many characters
[02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:41.160]  to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour movie.
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:44.160]  She's clearly, though, the protagonist,
[02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:48.160]  and I think she's well-written,
[02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:52.160]  and I think Daisy Ridley was...
[02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:54.160]  It's the definition of good casting
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:57.160]  is I can't imagine any other actress in a role.
[02:31:57.160 --> 02:32:00.160]  And she carried Force Awakens.
[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:02.160]  It's like, put someone else in that role.
[02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:03.160]  She has to be amazing in that movie.
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.160]  There's a lot of weight on her shoulders,
[02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:06.160]  and she carries it.
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:07.160]  She is amazing.
[02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:08.160]  Yep.
[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:10.160]  Ever in both movies.
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.160]  You know, I love, and to me,
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:16.160]  I compare it to the first act of Wall-E
[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:18.160]  where it's all nonverbal.
[02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:19.160]  Her setup.
[02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:23.160]  Her working as a junker on Jakku.
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:25.160]  But that's not easy.
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:27.160]  I don't think that's easy for her.
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:30.160]  I mean, I can't act to save my life,
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:34.160]  but I think that of all the forms of acting,
[02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:36.160]  being the only character on screen
[02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:39.160]  not communicating or talking to anybody
[02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:42.160]  and trying to convey interest and intent
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:46.160]  and her scratching days off the wall and everything.
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:47.160]  I don't know.
[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:51.160]  I really do feel like she's the best thing
[02:32:51.160 --> 02:32:53.160]  going in the whole trilogy,
[02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:55.160]  and it's really, really well done
[02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:57.160]  on the writer's parts, the casting parts,
[02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:00.160]  the director's parts, and certainly Daisy Ridley's part.
[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.160]  I expect her to go on to great things.
[02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:04.160]  I think she's obviously, you know,
[02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:07.160]  the schedule of these movies is going to,
[02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:09.160]  I don't think I've seen her in any,
[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:10.160]  I don't think she's been in anything else yet,
[02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:12.160]  but I foresee her.
[02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:14.160]  Murder on the Orange X-Fest.
[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:15.160]  Oh, I haven't seen that yet.
[02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:16.160]  I haven't seen it, so that's great
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:17.160]  that she's in something like that.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:19.160]  But I foresee, if I could buy stock
[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:20.160]  in an actor's career,
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:23.160]  I would buy a lot of stock in Daisy Ridley.
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.160]  Yeah.
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:26.160]  Anything else that you guys want to talk about
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.160]  before we wrap this up?
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:30.160]  I have one thing I'll say,
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:33.160]  and it ties in to the same scene.
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.160]  Syracuse's observation that the lightsaber,
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:38.160]  Kylo Ren's lightsaber spins before,
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.160]  and that gives him the idea to spin the other lightsaber,
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:44.160]  totally Hitchcockian filmmaker,
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:47.160]  where he lets the audience,
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:49.160]  he doesn't try to surprise the audience
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:52.160]  with that lightsaber going through Snoke.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.160]  He's like, oh, you know,
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:55.160]  we get like a full 30 seconds
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:57.160]  of knowing that that's his plan,
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:33:59.160]  and we get to worry about whether Snoke
[02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:01.160]  is going to notice it and foil it.
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:03.160]  That is cinematic suspense,
[02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:05.160]  and it is truly filmmaking.
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:07.160]  The Hitchcockian thing is that
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:09.160]  if you put a bomb under a seat
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:12.160]  in a movie theater,
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.160]  the suspense isn't...
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:14.160]  Show the audience the bomb.
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.160]  Show the audience,
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:18.160]  like show the people watching the movie the bomb,
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:21.160]  but you don't show the people filing in the bomb.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.160]  Because now you know something
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:25.160]  that they don't know,
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.160]  and you are horrified about it.
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:29.160]  This works the opposite way
[02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:31.160]  in that you know something that
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:33.160]  Snoke doesn't know,
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:36.160]  and it works amazingly well.
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.160]  The other Hitchcockian element to Snoke
[02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.160]  in that same scene is that,
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:45.160]  I would analogize it to Janet Leigh in Psycho,
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:47.160]  where Janet Leigh was this huge movie star,
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:50.160]  and her name was above the title in Psycho,
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:53.160]  and she gets killed 20 minutes into the movie,
[02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:56.160]  which is unheard of before or since, really.
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:58.160]  You could count on one hand
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:00.160]  how many times the biggest name actor...
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:02.160]  Steven Seagal in Executive Decision?
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.160]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:06.160]  It's right up there with Janet Leigh, right?
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:08.160]  Right.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:10.160]  I have to admit, the first time watching this,
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:12.160]  I was under the assumption
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.160]  that Snoke was going to foil it.
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:15.160]  You know, it would be like,
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:16.160]  oh, you thought that was going to work?
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:18.160]  No, you know.
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:21.160]  So him actually dying in the second movie,
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:22.160]  not the third movie,
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:25.160]  was a total Hitchcockian.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.160]  Yeah, you thought you know where this was going,
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:28.160]  and we were setting up a big,
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:30.160]  you're going to kill somebody,
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:32.160]  you know, Ray's going to kill Snoke in the third movie?
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:33.160]  Forget it.
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:35.160]  This is not going to end the way you think it will.
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:36.160]  Right.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.160]  And I really, really thought that was pretty clever
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:41.160]  and really well done and satisfying and exciting.
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:44.160]  It satisfied that part of my brain
[02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:47.160]  that wants this movie to show me things
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:48.160]  that I'm not expecting.
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:50.160]  You know, don't make me feel like
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:51.160]  I'm five seconds ahead of the movie,
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:55.160]  make me feel like I'm catching up to the movie.
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:56.160]  The only other thing I want to add is
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:59.160]  I think that it will serve this trilogy well
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:03.160]  to have a significant time jump before the third movie.
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.160]  Yes, I totally agree.
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:06.160]  They don't need to have one,
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.160]  but they should have one because it opens.
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.160]  Look where we have,
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.160]  we have the entire resistance fitting on the Falcon
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.160]  and they've sparked something off
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:16.160]  and they've got the ending of this one
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  with the little boy with the broom.
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:18.160]  I'm not sure it lands
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.160]  because I don't really care about that boy,
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:21.160]  but I get what they're trying to say.
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:22.160]  But you need time to pass.
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:23.160]  You need time,
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:25.160]  now you need time for the rebellion
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:26.160]  to come back to something.
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:28.160]  You need that spark to something that happens.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.160]  So as far as I'm concerned,
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:31.160]  they could start the next movie
[02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:34.160]  where the rebellion has the first order on its heels
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:36.160]  and they feel like they're close to victory
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.160]  and that, you know, the conflict could be about like,
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:40.160]  but how are you going to resolve the Rey Kylo thing?
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:42.160]  Like they have many, many possibilities,
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:45.160]  but I feel like now it's time for a time jump.
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:46.160]  I agree.
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:47.160]  And I think it needs to get to the point
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.160]  where Rey as the new Luke needs to be like Luke
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:51.160]  at the beginning of Return of the Jedi,
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:54.160]  where she's, at the beginning of the next movie,
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:56.160]  she already considers herself a Jedi Knight.
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:58.160]  She's done that much work and training.
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:00.160]  Yeah, she's got a new outfit.
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.160]  Maybe constructed a new lightsaber.
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.160]  Well, I mean, she took the books, right?
[02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:05.160]  So she needs a hood.
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:06.160]  She needs a hood.
[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:07.160]  She needs a hood.
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.160]  She's got to get a hood.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:09.160]  A hood would be great.
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.160]  I mean, the other thing is that,
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:16.160]  the time jump just makes sense.
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.160]  We can't just follow this on one from another.
[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:24.160]  Right.
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.160]  If we don't get a time jump, we get,
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:29.160]  I mean, the fundamental thing,
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:32.160]  and, you know, may she rest in peace,
[02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:36.160]  is that Carrie Fisher has passed.
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:40.160]  And I would be surprised if the next movie
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:44.160]  didn't address that in some way as
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.160]  putting some time between the movies.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:48.160]  And during that time,
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:53.160]  General Leia had, you know,
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:57.160]  established some kind of system
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:59.160]  or general rule set.
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:01.160]  They can explain her in the crawl.
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:03.160]  They can say, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:05.160]  General Leia has, you know,
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.160]  died in the battle or whatever,
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:08.160]  died from old age,
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:11.160]  or the resistance inspired by their late general.
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:12.160]  You could do that in the crawl.
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:13.160]  You could have the opening scene.
[02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:14.160]  Right.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:18.160]  But what I mean is we need some time, right?
[02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:20.160]  We need to have time between this one
[02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:23.160]  and the next one in order to sort of,
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:27.160]  you know, pull the reset button a little bit.
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.160]  We can't do what we did last time,
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:30.160]  which was like,
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:33.160]  hey, I'm giving you a lightsaber and, you know.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.160]  And as for Rian Johnson having the script
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:36.160]  to the third one,
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.160]  I think the script was written when Carrie Fisher was still alive.
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:40.160]  So there's already a couple of months.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:41.160]  Yes, it was.
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:42.160]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.160]  Yeah.
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:45.160]  And in fact, Disney has even acknowledged
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.160]  or somebody acknowledged on the record
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:49.160]  that, you know, Carrie Fisher had a major role
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.160]  in the first draft of the next movie.
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  That's the problem.
[02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:56.160]  She thought she'd be alive for it.
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:57.160]  Right.
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:59.160]  Well, I mean, also,
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:03.160]  they have said that they will not recreate her digitally.
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:05.160]  I mean, that's a good call.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.160]  Carrie Fisher, a huge piece, is gone.
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:15.160]  And it is one of those human corporate moments
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:19.160]  where, you know, they won't do it.
[02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:20.160]  They just...
[02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:22.160]  Yeah, I think they could do it if they wanted to.
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:24.160]  Oh, they could, but they won't.
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:25.160]  Yeah.
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.160]  Well, I think they'll probably kill her in the crawl.
[02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:28.160]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:29.160]  Like Syracuse said.
[02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:31.160]  I think if they wanted to explain it
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:32.160]  in the opening scene of the movie
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:34.160]  and have some kind of battle going on,
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:39.160]  where Leia's on a doomed ship and is about to be killed,
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:41.160]  and we only see her from another ship
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:44.160]  where she's doing one of the fuzzy blue staticky holograms,
[02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.160]  that they could...
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:48.160]  I guess some people would be offended even by that.
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:49.160]  It won't happen.
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.160]  They didn't even let...
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:53.160]  So Luke didn't die in violence.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:54.160]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:55.160]  Luke is a pacifist.
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:56.160]  Right.
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:57.160]  Right.
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.160]  He died...
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:39:59.160]  I don't think they'll do that.
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:02.160] ...using all of his energy, and that was it.
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:03.160]  And he died in peace.
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:05.160]  If they're going to show Leia dying,
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:06.160]  I think the only way they could do it
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:08.160]  would be by hologram or something.
[02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.160]  They can't try to CGI the actual Carrie Fisher in
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:12.160]  like they did in Rogue One.
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:13.160]  No, no.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:15.160]  It's funny, though, because it's so funny.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.160]  Do you think...
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.160]  It's such a weird question,
[02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:20.160]  but they're not going to put Carrie Fisher in
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:24.160]  as a CGI 60-year-old woman in Episode Nine,
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:28.160]  but if Carrie Fisher had happened to die before Rogue One,
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:32.160]  would they still have CGI'd in young 19-year-old Carrie Fisher
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:33.160]  at the end of that movie?
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:35.160]  So the second time I saw...
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:36.160]  Go ahead, Jon.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.160]  I would say I think it's corporate, you know,
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:41.160]  respecting her wishes and being her spell,
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:43.160]  but I'm sure lawyers are involved,
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:46.160]  and I'm pretty sure that Carrie Fisher was savvy enough to say,
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:49.160]  is there something I can do involving lawyers and contracts
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:51.160]  to make sure that this thing I don't want to happen
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:52.160]  actually doesn't happen?
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:53.160]  So I bet she's actually tied some hands.
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:56.160]  And she was on board, obviously, with the Rogue One one,
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:58.160]  and I think she was explicitly not on board
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.160]  with CGI-ing her into future movies,
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:02.160]  so...
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.160]  Well, no, I don't know that she would have had any thought.
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:06.160]  I mean, who the hell thinks they're going to die?
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:09.160]  Especially if you were the person who was prominently CG'd
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:11.160]  into another movie and they got your approval for it,
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:13.160]  it would be in your head to be thinking about,
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:14.160]  do you want them to do that with you?
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:19.160]  What I saw from Kathleen Kennedy was just that we just,
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:20.160]  you know, we just loved her so much,
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:21.160]  and we just don't think it'd be right.
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:23.160]  We know it wouldn't play well, and we're just not going to do it.
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:25.160]  I mean, that could also be true.
[02:41:25.160 --> 02:41:27.160]  I'm going with the human...
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:31.160]  Yeah, I'm going with Cooper's human interpretation of this,
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:33.160]  where, guess what?
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:35.160]  Could be some lawyers, but even if they have a document...
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:36.160]  She's a family member, we're not going to do that.
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:38.160]  I think Carrie Fisher's savvy enough to know that,
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:39.160]  yeah, Kathleen Kennedy's your friend,
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:41.160]  and you're all on board on the same page,
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:43.160]  but Star Wars is now a franchise that's going to outlive
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:45.160]  all these people, including Kathleen Kennedy.
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.160]  Like, you know, it's forward-thinking enough to say,
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.160]  this franchise could go on and on and on,
[02:41:51.160 --> 02:41:53.160]  and if you don't want to be CG'd into every movie,
[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:55.160]  do what you can to try to make that not happen.
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:59.160]  So, I mean, this was, well, last year.
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:05.160]  Second time I saw the movie, I took my friend Adrian,
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:11.160]  and it happened to be the day that Carrie Fisher died,
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:15.160]  and we didn't know that, so we were, you know,
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:19.160]  we bought tickets to vote one, we got up to the popcorn desk,
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:22.160]  and the guy is literally in tears.
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:25.160]  I'm like, uh, are you okay? Like, what's going on?
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:28.160]  He's like, uh, Carrie Fisher died.
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.160]  And Adrian hadn't seen the movie yet.
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:36.160]  I'm like, okay, well, that sucks.
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:39.160]  And he gave us our popcorn and our, you know,
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:45.160]  our sodas for free, because he was like, screw it.
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:49.160]  Carrie Fisher's dead. I literally don't care.
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:54.160]  So we went to see the movie, and right at the last minute,
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:59.160]  Carrie Fisher in CGI pops up, and I couldn't help but cry,
[02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.160]  even though I knew it was coming.
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:04.160]  I mean, you know, I definitely teared up.
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:07.160]  And after the movie, I had to explain this, like,
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:13.160]  yeah, look, she died today, and that was, you know, touching.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:21.160]  And when I sat down for this new movie, I don't know.
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:24.160]  I mean, the first time Carrie Fisher came on screen,
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:27.160]  it stung a little bit, right?
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:30.160]  Yeah, it did. It really did.
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:33.160]  It's so great that she was so good in a movie
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.160]  and had such a good role, you know,
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:38.160]  but it really, there was such a,
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:40.160]  it played so differently than it would have.
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:43.160]  Even if it, who knows, it may not have changed
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:45.160]  one single edit of her scenes,
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:49.160]  but it played so differently in my chest, you know,
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:52.160]  in my tear ducts than it would if Carrie Fisher were alive.
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:54.160]  Especially that last scene with her and Luke,
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:56.160]  that scene looks for all the world,
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:58.160]  like it was written after she was already dead,
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.160]  but that obviously could not have been true because she's in it.
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:05.160]  Right, but it really does play that way, right?
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:06.160]  Anything else?
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:09.160]  I feel like it's almost criminal not to at least mention
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:11.160]  Laura Dern and her Admiral Holdo.
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:13.160]  Oh yeah, on that there is a little bit of follow-up
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:15.160]  from the previous episode in The Incomparable.
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:17.160]  I was talking about how there was a dialogue scene
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:20.160]  between Laura Dern and Poe that looked like it was edited crazily,
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:22.160]  and I couldn't understand why everyone else in the theater
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:23.160]  wasn't turning their head to look at me and going,
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:24.160]  you're all seeing this, right?
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:27.160]  Like, this is not, something is wrong with the editing
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:30.160]  of this very simple, over-the-shoulder, back-and-forth dialogue scene,
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:33.160]  and since doing that podcast, I have learned that
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:36.160]  in that scene, apparently, kind of like Woody in Toy Story,
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:41.160]  that Holdo, Laura Dern's character, was originally
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:45.160]  much more mean to Poe and dismissive and cranky at him,
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.160]  and they changed their mind and wanted her to be
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:52.160]  not so mean to him, not so dismissive and belittling,
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:55.160]  but to be, you know, more of like, not telling him what's up,
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:57.160]  but not being mean to him.
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.160]  But they had, they didn't have reshoots for that,
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:03.160]  so they had to slice together the footage they had
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:07.160]  with the dubbed-in dialogue of the lines they wanted her to say
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:09.160]  and the way that they wanted her to say them,
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:11.160]  so it's, like, watch it when it comes to the video,
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:14.160]  I don't know if they actually do reshoots, but it's cut crazily,
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:16.160]  like, in the middle of people's sentences,
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:18.160]  you go back and forth to the other person,
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.160]  because they can't show the lips, because the lips don't match the words,
[02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:23.160]  and that is a, that's one of those things that's like,
[02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:25.160]  well, it's moviemaking, you know, it doesn't always come out the way you want,
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:28.160]  it just, it's strange to me that they didn't bother to do a reshoot for that,
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:31.160]  because that part of the movie looks like the movie is broken,
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:34.160]  and I'm glad there's an explanation for it, but it's like,
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:37.160]  do the reshoot, it was an interior on the spaceship,
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:40.160]  it's an over-the-shoulder dialogue shot, like, just do it.
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:43.160]  Did you ever see, did you ever notice that in Rogue One,
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:48.160]  the scene between Jyn Erso and Che Guererra, what's his name,
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:50.160]  whatever, Forest Whitaker's...
[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.160]  Erase his name from my head by saying that.
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:55.160]  Something Guererra.
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:56.160]  Saw Guererra.
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:57.160]  Saw Guererra.
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:59.160]  Saw Guererra, yeah.
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:04.160]  That scene was rewritten, and they didn't have footage for,
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:07.160]  and the first time I saw it, I was like, this scene is,
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:12.160]  this is so weird, there's like no two shots of the two of them in the room together.
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:16.160]  It's clearly, I don't know what the original...
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:19.160]  You need the emotional bond to make everything else work,
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:21.160]  and it didn't happen, right?
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.160]  Right, it's like the original scene was shot where he was playing the video
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:29.160]  from her father explaining his secret trap in the Death Star,
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:31.160]  and it must have been with an entirely different character,
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:34.160]  and they're like, well, this should be Jyn instead of somebody else,
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:38.160]  and they didn't bother to get them together to reshoot it,
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:41.160]  and so they just shot...
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:45.160]  That it works as well as it does shows how good they are at film editing,
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:48.160]  but if you're looking at it, the fact that there's no two shots
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:52.160]  of showing the two people together in the room, it's like, it really sticks out.
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.160]  Anyway, that's interesting, and a movie with a budget like this,
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:59.160]  and the amount of money it's making, that they wouldn't reshoot it.
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.160]  Every movie, no movie has free money.
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:03.160]  That's the hard part of movie making.
[02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:10.160]  And as for Holdo, her trying to teach Poe lessons in this environment is not great.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:13.160]  Both Luke and Holdo, two times in the same movie,
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.160]  you have someone not telling other people their plan,
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:19.160]  either as a way to teach them or just as a way to add tension.
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.160]  Like, Luke should have told them, hey, I'm going to stall them, you guys escape,
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:25.160]  but he didn't because they wanted us to have the moment of Poe figuring it out
[02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:27.160]  and the audience figuring it out, but that's a bad idea.
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:31.160]  Like, Luke, tell everybody, my plan is to go out there and stall you guys' escape.
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:34.160]  Don't let Poe figure it out during his thing because it's stupid.
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:36.160]  Holdo, tell Poe your plan.
[02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:38.160]  Oh, I shouldn't tell him. He was just demoted, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:42.160]  Look, if you know Poe is a hothead and you're afraid he's going to go do something crazy,
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:45.160]  the smart thing to do is to tamp him down.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:47.160]  You don't have to tell him the plan.
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:50.160]  You just have to tell him that you have a plan.
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:53.160]  As Anthony Johnston was saying on a different Uncomfortable episode,
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.160]  good leadership is realizing you've got a problem with his hothead.
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:59.160]  Neutralize him. Don't have to bring him in on the details of the plan
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:01.160]  because you're afraid he'll leak it or mess it up or whatever,
[02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:06.160]  but just don't do what you did, which is essentially not say anything
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.160]  and let him spin off into oblivion with his, like,
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:11.160]  well, if you're not going to do anything, I'm going to save him.
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:13.160]  You see that happening, you've got to stop it.
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:15.160]  So that was some silliness from Holdo,
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:17.160]  and I don't like those kind of sitcom plot lines where, like,
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.160]  if you just talk to her for two seconds, this whole plot thread would be,
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:22.160]  like, you get, I give you an allowance for those,
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:24.160]  I think they're just a little bit over budget.
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:31.160]  So I would follow Laura Dern into the mouth of hell.
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.160]  That character was great. I looked for what she ended up doing.
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:42.160]  The fact that she didn't want to inform Poe made a little bit of sense in that
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:45.160]  he just got a bunch of people killed.
[02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:48.160]  I know, but you know he's exactly the type of person who's going to come up with
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:50.160]  a harebrained scheme on his own.
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:57.160]  So here's where I agree with you is that her failure to be a great leader
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.160]  was that she didn't sort of recognize that, and at least say,
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:07.160]  as Anthony Johnson says, at least, you know, tell us that there is a plan.
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.160]  And not just Poe. Like, everybody on that ship,
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:13.160]  part of being a leader is to let people know that you're in good hands.
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:17.160]  Like, you don't mind what I'm doing, but we have a plan that we're executing.
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:20.160]  Everybody on that ship seemed like, I mean, this is not just our character,
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:23.160]  but it's a problem of filmmaking. I think the film wanted you to believe
[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:25.160]  that everybody on the ship was okay with it except for Poe,
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:28.160]  but it just seemed like she was being kind of non-communicative.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:31.160]  Well, no, because, I mean, Leia's daughter was on.
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:33.160]  That's right. That's what undercuts it.
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:36.160]  Like, all of the people that we thought were the good guys were.
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:40.160]  She's on the bridge, so if there's anything going,
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:42.160]  if you think, if you're supposed to believe that the entire bridge crew
[02:49:42.160 --> 02:49:45.160]  understands that there's a plan, that's not put in the movie,
[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:47.160]  because the one helping Poe out is, you know.
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:51.160]  So, while I agree with you, Laura Dern,
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:57.160]  Haldo does not know how they were being tracked to hyperspace.
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:59.160]  I know, but they didn't. That's the thing. They didn't play that up either.
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:01.160]  They didn't play that up, right?
[02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:04.160]  Like, maybe there's a traitor. You need, like, one line or a look
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:06.160]  to establish that, and they didn't do it.
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.160]  Like, if maybe you got cut or whatever, like, there's, you know,
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:12.160]  a lot of things can be done slightly differently in that thread.
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:17.160]  You know what you need? You need one line between Leia and her,
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.160]  where Leia's like, we're being tracked, I don't know how.
[02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:22.160]  Maybe there's a traitor, let's keep this hush hush.
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:24.160]  And Haldo's like, okay, I got it.
[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:25.160]  And that's it.
[02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:28.160]  Should we tell Poe? If we don't tell him, he might do something crazy,
[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:30.160]  but if we do tell him, how do we know he's not, I don't know.
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:32.160]  You don't even need to be so explicit.
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:37.160]  You just need to be like, look, we're being tracked through hyperspace.
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:41.160]  And Haldo's like, all right, I'm going to shut everything down.
[02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:47.160]  Again, I'm not expecting scientific rigor on faster than light travel.
[02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:55.160]  But I do feel that as a general rule in sci-fi action movies,
[02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:59.160]  I don't like trackers, and I don't like cloaking devices,
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:02.160]  because they often just seem like lazy writing.
[02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:06.160]  And I just wish, I feel like the Star Wars idea of no matter what,
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:08.160]  if you can hyperspace away, you're free.
[02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:11.160]  And I feel like I'm okay with saying that something happened
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:14.160]  that allowed them to track them this time,
[02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:16.160]  but I think it had to be like a traitor or something.
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:19.160]  That's what I really wanted. I wanted the traitor.
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:24.160]  In Star Wars, space battles work like car chases or airplane fights.
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:27.160]  They don't work like Star Trek things where there's cloaking and nebulas
[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:30.160]  and stuff like that, and so they brought a lot of that stuff in just fine.
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:33.160]  I mean, the light speed ramming is a real problem
[02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.160]  if you think about it for more than three seconds,
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:39.160]  but I mostly give it to them. You can headcanon it away.
[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:41.160]  It's a dramatic scene. It works.
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:43.160]  That's the thing with this particular thread.
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:46.160]  I'm willing to give it like 60% of what it takes,
[02:51:46.160 --> 02:51:49.160]  but it takes a little bit too much and fumbles a few things.
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:51.160]  So it's not as weak as the canto byte thread,
[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:54.160]  but it's not as strong as the Rey kylo thread.
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:58.160]  But I really dug Laura.
[02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:02.160]  Again, there's some problems with the writing in terms of what she does,
[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.160]  especially early, but I really dug the gravitas of her character.
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.160]  I bought it.
[02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:08.160]  Gravitas.
[02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:12.160]  Gravitas, whatever. Whatever the word is.
[02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:16.160]  I bought it that she was a leader,
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:20.160]  and I thought that the scene with her and Leia saying goodbye
[02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:23.160]  was exactly what I wanted a little more of.
[02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:24.160]  Exactly.
[02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:26.160]  The movie, which is a hint of,
[02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:29.160]  hey, these two have known each other for the last thing.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.160]  They've been holding this resistance together.
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:34.160]  They're old school. They were in the rebellion.
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:38.160]  I don't know how long that scene was. Was it 90 seconds?
[02:52:38.160 --> 02:52:39.160]  I don't know.
[02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:41.160]  Not a whole bunch of lines of dialogue,
[02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:44.160]  and some of it is just so super Star Wars-y
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:45.160]  where they both say,
[02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:47.160]  may the force be with you at the same time,
[02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:50.160]  and Leia says, hey, I've said it enough. You say it.
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:53.160]  A bunch of that, by the way, was punched up by Carrie Fisher.
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:55.160]  I know. Yeah.
[02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:57.160]  Apparently that idea was Carrie Fisher's.
[02:52:57.160 --> 02:52:59.160]  Not surprising, but it works,
[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.160]  and it's the way they deliver it
[02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:05.160]  that it just feels like these are two women who've been,
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:08.160]  like Sean just said, just holding this together
[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:11.160]  with the strength of their personalities and resolve
[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:16.160]  and knowing that they're on the right side of this.
[02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:17.160]  I just felt it.
[02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:21.160]  And again, to me, that's Star Wars, is that hint of,
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:23.160]  we get to see the tip of the iceberg,
[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:26.160]  and you just sense that there's this other stuff
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:28.160]  underneath that they don't have time to put in,
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:29.160]  and it's there,
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:31.160]  and I really thought that she helped add to that.
[02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:35.160]  That conversation was the Ord Mandel of this movie for me,
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:37.160]  which is like, oh, man,
[02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:41.160]  these two have been through a lot together.
[02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:45.160]  And in some ways, it diminishes Poe in that,
[02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:47.160]  okay, fine, you're a hotshot pilot
[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:51.160]  under some command and whatever.
[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:55.160]  These people are holding it together.
[02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:59.160]  They're on the, not even just the next level,
[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:02.160]  they're two levels up,
[02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:05.160]  holding the resistance and forming it
[02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:10.160]  into an actionable thing.
[02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:11.160]  I don't have anything else.
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:13.160]  That's a wrap for me.
[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:15.160]  Unfortunately, I don't think we have time to bring Ryan
[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:16.160]  out of the green room.
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:18.160]  We'll have to have him on the next time.
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.160]  Do you guys have anything else you want to add
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:21.160]  as a final comment?
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:24.160]  Well, so what you don't know is that
[02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:27.160]  we always have a cavalcade of special guests,
[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:30.160]  and this year, and I'm not joking,
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:32.160]  and Syracuse knows this,
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:37.160]  we actually have a crew with a microphone back there,
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.160]  and we've been recording them.
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:44.160]  Yeah, so I'll send you the link to that
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:47.160]  right after the show, yeah.
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:49.160]  Anything else, John Sirkusa?
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:51.160]  Actually, there's probably more stuff,
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:53.160]  but you know, we just can't go on forever.
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:56.160]  I'll see you all in a year or two for the next one,
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:59.160]  and we'll, like in this podcast,
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:00.160]  we talk a ton about Star Wars movies
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:02.160]  that are not The Last Jedi.
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:04.160]  Next year, we'll talk about whatever the new movie is,
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:07.160]  but also maybe talk more about The Last Jedi.
[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:08.160]  Yeah, all right, thank you guys.
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:10.160]  Happy New Year, happy holidays,
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:12.160]  and I really thank you for your time.
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:41.160]  This was a blast.
