[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Uh, here we are. We're recording on
[00:02.760 --> 00:08.840]  Friday June 5th. So three days before the WWDC cannot keynote and my guest is
[00:09.560 --> 00:12.680]  Mark Gurman from 9 to 5 Mac fame
[00:13.800 --> 00:16.160]  Mark, I think what's it been about a year since you've been on the show?
[00:17.880 --> 00:24.560]  Yeah, I think last time was a little bit of after the previous WWDC well, I couldn't think of anybody better to have
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.880]  for the WWDC
[00:26.880 --> 00:29.760]  Crayload show as I would call it then you
[00:31.120 --> 00:36.200]  Appreciate it. You've had a remarkable run this year in my opinion. Well, we'll see how it comes on Monday, but
[00:36.800 --> 00:38.800]  It looks like you have
[00:39.920 --> 00:41.920]  Scored an enormous number of scoops
[00:42.480 --> 00:46.960]  Thanks. I appreciate it people who don't want Christmas spoils should probably just stop listening now
[00:48.120 --> 00:50.120]  Yeah, I'd agree with that one
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.720]  Uh, were you the type of kid who who hunted through the house for Christmas presents?
[00:58.280 --> 01:04.360]  I'm Jewish. So, okay. Well Hanukkah, right, but we have Passover and
[01:05.160 --> 01:07.160]  The tradition is to hide the matzah
[01:07.640 --> 01:12.920]  Somewhere in the house and I would always be the one to find it when I was growing up. So yeah pretty much
[01:13.320 --> 01:19.320]  Yeah, but are you supposed to hide you're supposed to find that right? What about like what about like birthday presents?
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.400]  Oh
[01:20.400 --> 01:26.200]  Yeah, yeah, maybe I'd go digging sometimes for those. I don't really remember but I get your point
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.720]  I remember twice doing it and
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.240]  The thing is is I found it at the same place both times one time I found a
[01:35.440 --> 01:37.440]  brand new dirt bike and
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.600]  Bicycle in the basement. There's this like like in the back of my parents basement. There's like a little like
[01:45.320 --> 01:48.100]  Extra room behind the door and I wasn't even looking for presents
[01:48.100 --> 01:54.140]  I just I don't know what I was just you know bored and like looking around the basement and I went in there and there
[01:54.140 --> 01:57.180]  Was this awesome brand new shiny chrome?
[01:57.740 --> 02:00.580]  dirt bike with red trim and red tires and
[02:01.180 --> 02:07.620]  I was so naive and this was I don't know like a couple of weeks before my birthday and I'm so naive
[02:07.660 --> 02:14.580]  I didn't think holy shit. They got me a dirt bike for for my birthday. I thought why is there a dirt bike in my
[02:15.220 --> 02:17.220]  basement
[02:17.220 --> 02:19.420]  How old are you at the time? I was probably
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.780]  I'm gonna guess around like 10 or 11. Oh
[02:24.060 --> 02:28.740]  And then and then I knew though that's the room to look in and then that for that Christmas
[02:28.740 --> 02:34.820]  I went in there and looked around and I saw that I was getting the Millennium Falcon the big-ass Kenner Millennium Falcon toy
[02:35.780 --> 02:37.020]  and
[02:37.020 --> 02:43.020]  Then on this is true. I honestly thought you know what? I'm gonna stop looking for Christmas presents because now I feel terrible
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.020]  Yeah
[02:45.380 --> 02:47.380]  Yeah, I know what you mean
[02:47.620 --> 02:49.700]  It's a little different with the Apple stuff. I
[02:50.540 --> 02:56.300]  Mean, there's a lot of people who you know, when all these stories are coming through they're like, why are you publishing this?
[02:56.300 --> 03:02.920]  This is a lot of information. You're ruining the keynote. I don't look at it that way at all. There's movie spoilers
[03:03.540 --> 03:09.020]  You know people hunting for their birthday gifts. You don't have to read the stuff but just doing my job as a reporter
[03:09.020 --> 03:15.940]  I think what people are a little angry about is that you're so accurate. Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit. We'll see
[03:15.940 --> 03:18.180]  I have said I was on
[03:18.980 --> 03:21.820]  Josh Topolsky's tomorrow new tomorrow podcast
[03:22.900 --> 03:28.420]  Earlier this week and then last week with Renee Ritchie here on my show, but both times you came up
[03:29.020 --> 03:35.420]  Just in the eye. I don't see how you can't come up if you're gonna start saying what do you expect for WWDC?
[03:35.420 --> 03:39.620]  But I mean this sincerely I I've been reading
[03:40.020 --> 03:47.940]  You know Apple rumor websites ever since Apple rumor website started and I'm not even saying nine-to-five back is more than a rumor website
[03:48.180 --> 03:51.480]  But the type of sites that publish, you know
[03:53.380 --> 03:56.980]  Ostensibly hopefully informed well-sourced, you know information about
[03:58.500 --> 04:02.940]  Upcoming Apple stuff that is not, you know not intended to be public information
[04:02.940 --> 04:07.260]  I've been following it since since they existed. So it's at least what like 20 years, you know
[04:07.260 --> 04:09.260]  The mid 90s when the web first came up
[04:09.900 --> 04:12.420]  And I remember in the early days
[04:13.020 --> 04:19.780]  Nobody was accurate. They were every site that existed at that time. That was like focused on rumors. I think there was like
[04:20.820 --> 04:27.580]  Mac OS rumors, I always used to get it confused with with now the long-standing website Mac rumors
[04:27.580 --> 04:34.980]  Right, but there was like Mac OS rumors and there were a couple more and their track records were atrocious
[04:36.860 --> 04:41.300]  And it's you know, it's I didn't have the name claim chowder yet from from my good friend
[04:42.220 --> 04:48.360]  Friends at panic the cable Sasser and Stephen Frank, but I've always been obsessed with the notion behind it
[04:48.360 --> 04:56.540]  Which is why does nobody keep track of this crap and and just remember that these this everybody's all excited about this site
[04:56.540 --> 05:01.420]  You know that is reporting something something about you know at the time, you know
[05:01.420 --> 05:05.260]  Like Mac OS 8.1 or something like that when these were the same clowns who a year ago
[05:05.420 --> 05:10.180]  Said this that and the other thing none of which panned out right, right and in that time
[05:10.180 --> 05:12.180]  There have been others who have had better records
[05:13.380 --> 05:15.700]  I've dabbled my toes in it in my own
[05:16.340 --> 05:23.140]  Koi way, but in my opinion nobody has had a run like you've had in the last two years with in terms of accuracy
[05:23.140 --> 05:30.460]  Yeah, I appreciate that. So it's something I wanted to ask you about your run last year before the Apple watch came out
[05:30.460 --> 05:37.140]  You had some koi line about Oh something next month in September when everyone was expecting the watch to come out in October
[05:37.580 --> 05:43.700]  Of last fall. Did you make a mistake there and you happen to get it right or was that like a true like koi?
[05:43.700 --> 05:46.320]  I know it's coming out in September type of thing
[05:48.300 --> 05:50.300]  It's an excellent question mark
[05:50.300 --> 05:52.160]  Ah
[05:52.160 --> 05:54.160]  We want the truth here. I
[05:55.540 --> 05:57.540]  I
[05:57.980 --> 06:02.800]  Didn't know and you know what here's the thing here's the reason that I don't even I
[06:03.620 --> 06:08.020]  Do less and less of that now than ever before is I found that it makes me
[06:11.060 --> 06:13.820]  Unhappy in life unsettled because
[06:15.140 --> 06:17.140]  These things can change
[06:17.140 --> 06:23.260]  But at the time that I wrote that I happened to know that the watch was planned for September
[06:23.260 --> 06:29.820]  But not it was probably sometime in August when I wrote that and I do remember that it was sort of a you know
[06:29.820 --> 06:32.180]  I got picked up by tech meme and and all this stuff
[06:32.780 --> 06:34.420]  I
[06:34.420 --> 06:36.420]  Did know that that was the plan
[06:37.420 --> 06:39.020]  and
[06:39.020 --> 06:43.300]  I you know, but it could change, you know, it definitely I could have been wrong
[06:43.300 --> 06:48.640]  which is why I didn't want to put it in in more concrete terms what I knew was I knew that the they had the
[06:48.640 --> 06:50.640]  bigger venue booked for September and
[06:51.060 --> 06:53.060]  I
[06:54.180 --> 06:58.500]  Just vague, you know and just not first it was very very distant
[06:58.500 --> 07:03.140]  But just you know, I I put it all together and it was very clear that it was September not October. I
[07:06.660 --> 07:08.660]  Think Pat Tchaikovsky had it as
[07:09.500 --> 07:11.300]  October
[07:11.300 --> 07:17.820]  Well, yeah, but when he said October that was like six months before the fall and right between two months worse
[07:17.820 --> 07:24.180]  Like you said things can change so right. Well, he knows what he's talking about for sure. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, he's you know rock-solid
[07:26.900 --> 07:28.140]  So
[07:28.140 --> 07:33.900]  Where do we start? I mean, there's actually a lot of stuff that has come out today. I mean, this is always the case before
[07:34.740 --> 07:39.820]  The right the keynotes. So there's two of the things that are that are today
[07:39.820 --> 07:45.180]  That I saw. I don't know if you saw these so business week or Bloomberg business. I don't know what they're calling it this week
[07:47.340 --> 07:53.260]  Lucas Shaw and Tim Higgins have a report that Apple it as of today Friday, June 5th is still
[07:53.900 --> 08:01.820]  Pushing to complete the music deals before Monday that they don't have all of the music labels on board for the
[08:03.340 --> 08:05.340]  I don't even see how it's
[08:05.340 --> 08:10.380]  It's not even a secret anymore that they're gonna go out with an updated streaming service, right?
[08:11.420 --> 08:15.260]  Yeah, they've always been a sort of 11th hour with those details
[08:15.260 --> 08:21.740]  I know you love that word even with like the book deals back in the first iPad and the newsstand stuff over the last few
[08:21.740 --> 08:26.260]  Years, so I think this is typical Apple every year whenever they do a big media launch
[08:26.260 --> 08:31.460]  We see stories that say hey, you know Apple still working on those deals faxing over some paperwork
[08:31.460 --> 08:35.380]  So this is not terribly surprising. Meanwhile, Eddie Q is
[08:35.900 --> 08:41.740]  Courtside at the Warriors game. Yeah. So who are you rooting for? Oh, I you know what?
[08:41.740 --> 08:45.260]  I used to be I'm a I used to be a huge basketball fan and I
[08:46.220 --> 08:51.460]  Kind of fell out with the NBA and I've kind of been getting back into it, especially this year
[08:51.460 --> 08:56.540]  I felt like the playoffs this year have been terribly exciting. Oh, yeah, absolutely. So I'm going with the Warriors
[08:56.540 --> 08:58.540]  I like the way they play
[08:58.540 --> 09:04.020]  I like the way they play but I have to say I like I do like the comeback story with
[09:04.740 --> 09:09.180]  With James going back to Cleveland and making them an instant contender
[09:09.180 --> 09:13.240]  I think yeah, I think it's two good teams and I like the way both teams play
[09:13.620 --> 09:18.500]  I happen to really really like the offense that that the Warriors play though
[09:18.500 --> 09:23.340]  I really like that penetrating and dish back out style of play
[09:23.340 --> 09:30.900]  Right. I mean, they're both fantastic teams. I agree with you on the comeback story with LeBron basically carrying the team through the East himself
[09:31.220 --> 09:35.780]  But I'm honestly not a fan of the whole Stephen Curry playing tops and play on the Warriors
[09:35.780 --> 09:42.540]  It's too flashy when he takes that 25-foot three-pointer and then turns around before it's going in the basket
[09:42.540 --> 09:48.980]  Like that's it's pretty pompous and I'd say I don't know. I like it. There's something about that that I
[09:48.980 --> 09:54.020]  It appeals to me. I feel like if I had actually been a good player the player that I could have
[09:54.020 --> 09:56.060]  You know would have dreamed of being would have been like curry
[09:56.620 --> 10:01.780]  Yeah, you could have been in the NBA instead of writing during fireball. Yeah, sort of a Reggie Miller style
[10:01.940 --> 10:06.940]  Wouldn't you say you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah a bit Reggie Miller similar build, you know
[10:08.140 --> 10:12.040]  Dead dead dead shooter from you know, incredible distance
[10:12.860 --> 10:14.860]  Anywhere, that's crazy
[10:14.860 --> 10:22.320]  But anyway, there's a great picture that's been circulating in the AP today of Eddie Q's sort of cheering
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.760]  Cheering LeBron on from courtside. Yeah, this is why the deals aren't done yet picture proof
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.600]  What a year Eddie Q has had as a basketball fan. He's a Duke fan and a Warriors season ticket holder
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.640]  so his college team already won the college championship and
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.520]  And and his pro team is one game up in the finals
[10:46.200 --> 10:52.160]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll see how that works out over the next couple weeks. I still think LeBron has a comeback in him
[10:52.520 --> 10:58.560]  I'll tell you that's the thing about the NBA Finals is it's where you know the team with the greatest with it
[10:58.560 --> 10:59.800]  You know, it sounds stupid
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.920]  but it's the one sport where I think it's true where
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.760]  When it comes to the finals the team that if there's two teams with like a Hall of Fame type player
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.680]  And I wouldn't even say that Curry's a Hall of Fame type player. It's too early
[11:11.680 --> 11:15.040]  But right, you know if he continues where he is, he will be
[11:16.320 --> 11:23.100]  But with the greatest of the greater of the two all-star stars usually wins regardless of the other
[11:23.620 --> 11:30.840]  Peripheral players on the team. Yeah, I'd agree with that. Right? I mean like and you know, the Jordan teams were the perfect example
[11:30.840 --> 11:32.840]  I mean Pippen was great and
[11:32.840 --> 11:40.680]  Uh, what was what's his name? Uh, the crazy fella Dennis Rodman, right? Rodman was a incredible force to be reckoned with but
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.940]  The truth is you know Jordan when it came down to it could carry the team on his back
[11:46.320 --> 11:49.480]  Yeah, same thing with Kobe a few years. Yes. They won. Oh
[11:50.300 --> 11:53.960]  Absolutely. Yeah, like the Kobe teams without Shaq
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.600]  Right. I love Kobe right huge Kobe fan, but no but he had that ability
[11:58.600 --> 12:06.000]  there's that's the weird thing and you know, maybe the quarterback in football is the closest that you can get to that but the idea of
[12:06.920 --> 12:08.920]  Keep it within a handful of points
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.980]  To three minutes to play and then let let him take over whoever you know, that may be
[12:16.400 --> 12:18.400]  Yeah, and it's game over, right? Yeah
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.520]  So, I don't know. Do you think Eddie's gonna go to the Sunday night game? I
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.620]  Can't believe that I good question. I'm gonna watch out for that. That's the thing to watch game
[12:28.620 --> 12:34.360]  Yeah, you know my understanding and Apple, you know, one of the things that they've always been pretty secretive about
[12:34.880 --> 12:36.880]  if not totally secret about is their
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  The process that they go through to rehearse keynotes, you know, they just don't talk about it, you know
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.460]  They've it goes through the weekend though. They're there right now. They'll be there this weekend
[12:47.460 --> 12:53.900]  It definitely goes through the weekend, but I've heard stories that there have been times where it goes
[12:54.740 --> 12:59.320]  Almost surprisingly late Sunday night given that you know
[13:00.980 --> 13:07.580]  You know that it's they're gonna be on stage and they want to look fresh, you know, 10 o'clock Monday morning, right, right
[13:08.820 --> 13:11.840]  We'll see Eddie shows up in his Warriors jersey or not
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.800]  You know, well and I expect that Eddie would have a major role in it because the way that Apple
[13:19.440 --> 13:22.240]  does keynotes is whoever is I
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.840]  Don't know if it's quite the it, you know that internal lingo of DRI
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.120]  but whoever the executive is who's in charge of whatever it is that's being
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.560]  Keynoted is the one who presents it and if you know, absolutely
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.480]  It seems like there might be a big chunk of the keynote. That's gonna be an eddy cues
[13:39.480 --> 13:41.480]  a domain
[13:41.760 --> 13:44.300]  Like what with Eddie key there's Apple music
[13:45.160 --> 13:51.780]  Well, and well, it's about it. Yeah. Well, I guess if if it's true that Apple TV isn't making the cut
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.720]  Yeah, I think that those were I mean, there's three reports on it from three reputable
[13:57.440 --> 14:03.640]  Sites and just in the days before the keynote. So I think that that's probably right that they they cut it out
[14:03.640 --> 14:08.520]  I didn't see three. I saw Brian X Chen at the New York Times said no new Apple TV hardware
[14:08.520 --> 14:10.520]  Well, what else did you see?
[14:11.400 --> 14:13.320]  Patch Kowski at BuzzFeed
[14:13.320 --> 14:17.080]  Overrated that and then recode as well all the matter of minutes, huh?
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.840]  I did not see that so that that's really telling them
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.920]  I'm surprised you didn't have any take on Chen's report saying that they cut it out in mid-may
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.760]  What do you think about I
[14:32.280 --> 14:34.280]  That sounds
[14:34.280 --> 14:39.040]  It's unusual. I think right but it sounds about right given that
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.200]  What I had heard last I'd heard is it was set for WWDC, but I haven't heard anything likewise
[14:45.720 --> 14:53.580]  I even spoke to someone very reliable after those reports came out who said that the SDKs and all that they're preparing for Monday
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.880]  Still has or as of that day still had all the TV
[14:57.880 --> 15:05.760]  Kit stuff intertwined in there. So when developers pull the thing apart, I wouldn't be surprised to see some references to that on
[15:05.760 --> 15:10.960]  Monday afternoon or whenever people get their hands on it. Hmm. Well explain that to me though. What do you mean by that?
[15:10.960 --> 15:13.320]  So besides the Apple TV hardware, right?
[15:13.320 --> 15:18.920]  They're gonna have or they were planning an Apple TV SDK so developers could write
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.880]  You know apps for it the control from an iPhone or that new controller
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.300]  But now that you know, they're pushing back the hardware. It seems likely that they're probably gonna push back the SDK as well
[15:30.800 --> 15:37.060]  So what I heard was in terms of this being like a late decision that the SDK still has the tools
[15:37.440 --> 15:44.080]  For developing the Apple TV apps in it the SDK for iOS 9 that they're good. Oh, I see what you mean
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.640]  I was not I got you got right
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.140]  So now I assume or it could be assumed that they're scrambling to remove that
[15:50.140 --> 15:53.880]  Functionality from the build or releasing an older build without it
[15:53.880 --> 15:59.020]  so or just they just say screw it and let let everybody rip it apart Monday afternoon and
[15:59.540 --> 16:03.900]  So be it. Yeah, we'll see because they know that I mean, there's no you know, when
[16:04.820 --> 16:09.820]  Everyone's not something is left behind in an SDK and it seems pretty clear. It's a mistake
[16:10.380 --> 16:14.860]  Something like this would not be a mistake something like this would be what are we gonna do?
[16:15.260 --> 16:19.860]  Right back in the day when I first got my start writing they would leave stuff back all the time
[16:19.860 --> 16:21.860]  I remember with the iPad 2
[16:21.860 --> 16:23.380]  every spec
[16:23.380 --> 16:29.620]  Wallpapers everything was right and left in the SDK, but they've gotten better over the years like the last big league
[16:29.620 --> 16:36.700]  I remember was the fingerprint sensor in the iOS 8 SDK, but even that was pretty hidden
[16:36.700 --> 16:41.980]  Yeah, and even every once in a while something like icons or something like that, right? Right the icon show something
[16:44.380 --> 16:47.140]  So why I'm I
[16:47.140 --> 16:49.940]  I didn't read patch cow. I don't know how I missed it. But
[16:50.940 --> 16:54.620]  What's the what did patch Kowski say about why there's no?
[16:55.340 --> 16:57.340]  Apple TV hardware. I
[16:57.500 --> 17:03.980]  Don't remember exactly what he said, but something in the lines of it not being ready for prime time or something like that
[17:04.180 --> 17:10.920]  Yeah, I think that there were some people who were speculating that it was because the TV service
[17:11.260 --> 17:16.320]  You know with this idea that they're gonna have like you pay $20 a month or I don't know
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.380]  I made the number up but you pay X dollars a month to Apple and then you get a package of
[17:22.100 --> 17:23.780]  20 or 30
[17:23.780 --> 17:27.540]  Cable channels content. Yeah, I don't think that's the case at all
[17:27.540 --> 17:30.940]  I think the plan along was to announce the hardware apps
[17:31.660 --> 17:37.660]  SDK in June right release it soon after the keynote and then introduce the TV service and say
[17:38.140 --> 17:42.900]  Hey, you're gonna get the hardware now and then the service will come with a software update in the fall
[17:42.900 --> 17:48.300]  And I think that was always the plan and in the meantime, you can still get all of the iTunes content
[17:48.300 --> 17:53.940]  You already can you can buy episodes by the episode you can rent and buy movies, you know
[17:53.940 --> 17:57.220]  All the content you already know and love on Apple TV is already there
[17:57.780 --> 18:01.620]  Exactly and for their marketing scheme that would be that would be amazing for them
[18:01.620 --> 18:05.840]  Totally Apple to have it come out and roll out and then get all the exposure once again
[18:06.020 --> 18:11.100]  When the new service is ready in the fall. Yeah, so I don't think the two are connected in terms of
[18:11.100 --> 18:15.940]  The WWDC announcement being pushed back. Yeah, I'm I
[18:17.260 --> 18:21.940]  Suspect the same thing. I have to say I and then and I'm not being coy here. I really do know nothing
[18:21.940 --> 18:27.780]  I'm as surprised by this as anybody because I had heard just you know little things in it, you know for months
[18:27.780 --> 18:33.700]  I had heard that that Apple TV hardware was was on pace for WWDC along with the SDK etc
[18:34.100 --> 18:35.580]  I
[18:35.580 --> 18:37.580]  think though just my
[18:37.580 --> 18:43.100]  Spidey sense about the company is that if they're not announcing it on Monday, that means it's not ready
[18:43.820 --> 18:44.740]  Right, right
[18:44.740 --> 18:51.700]  I agree because I think that they probably wanted to ship it just a few weeks or a few months after the WWDC keynote and
[18:52.180 --> 18:54.180]  They're probably not able to hit that anymore
[18:54.180 --> 18:55.660]  so they want to just push back the
[18:55.660 --> 19:00.780]  announcement and maybe they feel like if they wait till the fall to announce it they can release the hardware like a week and a
[19:00.780 --> 19:05.140]  Half later do with iPhones and have plenty of quantity ready to go. Yeah
[19:05.140 --> 19:10.940]  Yeah, and it might be the sort of thing where you know, just loosely speaking
[19:10.940 --> 19:13.420]  I I have a sense that
[19:14.420 --> 19:19.820]  I mean iPhone is still a huge deal for the company. It's the biggest deal financially by
[19:20.340 --> 19:25.980]  Introducing new iPhones is harder and harder to make a big deal out of because it's a well-known
[19:26.620 --> 19:30.540]  product and so just like my example like I've said about last year, so
[19:30.540 --> 19:38.260]  Again, the two most popular iPhones that I've ever introduced, you know best-selling have propelled the company to new heights
[19:38.860 --> 19:40.500]  but
[19:40.500 --> 19:43.140]  There wasn't that much to say about them. They were self-explanatory
[19:43.460 --> 19:49.520]  It's the iPhone, you know and love except now it's thinner and it's bigger or really bigger
[19:50.180 --> 19:53.140]  Yeah, and it has an uncomfortable camera nubbin
[19:54.700 --> 19:57.380]  Yeah, they hit in the marketing show, right so
[19:57.380 --> 20:04.660]  So that's why I think that they wanted to pair it with the watch
[20:05.260 --> 20:10.300]  introduction and the fact that they could throw in Apple pay in between them as an introduction is
[20:10.460 --> 20:15.620]  icing on the cake because then that way they can hold their biggest event of the year or at least the biggest standalone event if
[20:15.620 --> 20:17.180]  You don't count WWDC
[20:17.180 --> 20:24.140]  Right and have big things to announce other than just the iPhone because it's really really hard to I think it was
[20:24.140 --> 20:27.260]  You know, however long Schiller was up there talking about the iPhones
[20:27.260 --> 20:31.380]  I think it would have really would have been hard for him to go much longer just because right
[20:31.380 --> 20:33.140]  There's not that much more to say
[20:33.140 --> 20:39.100]  Right. I agree there. So this fall probably like you said it would probably they'll probably double up on the iPhone and TV
[20:39.180 --> 20:45.980]  Yeah in September and maybe have a big iPad event in October with the new air mini and the bigger one the pro if that's ready
[20:45.980 --> 20:50.420]  Yeah, and whatever other you know others, you know, but like a smaller event maybe on campus again
[20:50.420 --> 20:57.260]  But I'd expect a big event September who we are skipping WWDC and talking about September, but that's what I would yeah
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.020]  But and I think you know if they're thinking hey, the software is not ready. Why release it now
[21:02.020 --> 21:05.340]  the only reason to do it would be so that they could have
[21:06.380 --> 21:11.560]  Whatever they're gonna call it TV kit, whatever, you know, it's called TV kit sessions at WWDC
[21:11.580 --> 21:16.140]  But if they introduce a new W a new developer API outside
[21:16.540 --> 21:18.300]  WWDC in the fall
[21:18.300 --> 21:24.980]  So be it, you know, right? Yeah, I mean they've done that before. I mean they did that with the original iPad, right?
[21:24.980 --> 21:28.660]  They introduced the iPad and said you've got you know, four weeks
[21:29.100 --> 21:34.180]  Update your apps to run on it go right and I won't be surprised at some big major app partners
[21:34.180 --> 21:39.540]  Maybe get the SDK seated to them and maybe July August late summer time frame ahead of time
[21:39.540 --> 21:44.240]  All right. All right. So I do think I think you know the writings on the wall that TV is out
[21:45.140 --> 21:47.420]  right, all right, let me take a break and
[21:47.420 --> 21:50.800]  Thank the first sponsor this this episode
[21:52.400 --> 21:56.780]  Haven't been here as a sponsor for a while, but they used to be and I'm delighted to have them back
[21:56.780 --> 21:59.240]  It's our good friends at harvest
[22:00.100 --> 22:07.300]  Harvest is a beautiful well-designed business tool for tracking time spent on client projects
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.580]  Started I believe I could be wrong
[22:10.700 --> 22:16.460]  But my recollection is that harvest started specifically as a prod as a product for designers tracking time
[22:16.460 --> 22:22.100]  And then they've expanded it to be sort of a general-purpose time tracking tool for anybody with a job where you want to track time
[22:22.660 --> 22:29.500]  But to me the best part is that because they started with these designer focus roots. It really is beautiful
[22:29.500 --> 22:32.420]  It is a really really good-looking app and system
[22:33.180 --> 22:39.940]  so the it's and it's really really focused on on being as simple as possible so that it is as easy and
[22:40.540 --> 22:42.780]  You don't even have to think about it to just get started
[22:42.780 --> 22:49.180]  You just start a timer from anywhere from your web browser from a desktop app your mobile device. They've got apps for everything
[22:49.860 --> 22:56.100]  And you just start a timer say what you're working on and then when you're done you hit stop and all of your time is
[22:56.100 --> 23:01.820]  Accounted for so no matter where you find yourself working, you know your desktop where you've got a big 5k
[23:02.900 --> 23:06.820]  Cinema iMac or in a coffee shop where you're on a different device
[23:06.820 --> 23:13.220]  You can still use the same system to track all of your time and it's really really focused on just making it easy
[23:13.340 --> 23:18.040]  Then after you've done all the work your tracked hours appear in visual
[23:18.380 --> 23:24.900]  Time reports designed to keep your projects on time and within budget and you can account for all your time
[23:25.060 --> 23:27.060]  Your projects are all
[23:27.060 --> 23:29.060]  Separated the way you want them to be
[23:29.580 --> 23:34.180]  And then it's easy to use those reports to see which of your clients and projects are
[23:34.180 --> 23:37.640]  Making you the most money and which are the ones that are costing you
[23:38.620 --> 23:41.140]  So it really helps you to be a more efficient
[23:41.740 --> 23:46.580]  You know consultant whatever you want to call it whatever you're doing that you're tracking your time with
[23:47.900 --> 23:53.940]  You can also even create invoices with your billable hours right from harvest so you can track your time
[23:54.820 --> 23:58.460]  Report your time and then even invoice so it all from the same system
[23:58.460 --> 24:01.740]  So here's where you go to find out more go to get harvest.com
[24:01.740 --> 24:04.060]  get harvest.com and
[24:04.800 --> 24:08.940]  use this coupon code the talk show all one word and
[24:09.780 --> 24:15.060]  You'll get a 30-day free trial and you'll save 50% on your first month
[24:15.340 --> 24:19.580]  So use the code the talk show 30-day free trial 50% off your first month
[24:21.220 --> 24:23.220]  All right, what else we got next week
[24:24.780 --> 24:26.780]  Obvious stuff now, here's the stuff that's no surprise
[24:26.780 --> 24:34.820]  Just in broad strokes new version of iOS gonna be called iOS 9 and a new version of OS 10 10.11
[24:35.740 --> 24:41.140]  Right. So what's the OS 10 name? You got last year, you know, what's your take this huh? You know what?
[24:41.140 --> 24:45.520]  So I mean in the spirit of openness, I will tell you
[24:47.120 --> 24:49.120]  Yosemite was a complete guess on my part
[24:49.700 --> 24:55.220]  Honest to God nobody's nobody from Apple. Nobody ever said I you know, hey, it's called Yosemite
[24:55.220 --> 24:58.100]  It did make a lot of sense. Well, my thought was
[24:59.580 --> 25:04.300]  Mavericks gave away that they're the type of place they're looking for like a nature
[25:05.220 --> 25:12.900]  You know big scenic type thing. I knew that it was going to be the version that has the big UI overall
[25:13.740 --> 25:18.700]  Which at least you know in marketing terms means it's a big OS update
[25:18.700 --> 25:26.380]  Sure, because it looks new and so Yosemite to me was the it's the big obvious one sort of like with the cat names
[25:26.380 --> 25:32.020]  The way that like lion was a big one that they were waiting for tiger was, you know, tiger and lion were the two big ones
[25:32.420 --> 25:33.960]  Yeah
[25:33.960 --> 25:40.660]  So I just guessed Yosemite. I have no idea this year because I really I don't I'm not even that familiar with with
[25:40.940 --> 25:43.580]  California's, you know natural park system or or
[25:45.220 --> 25:47.220]  Beaches so I no guess this year
[25:47.220 --> 25:49.220]  Okay
[25:49.900 --> 25:56.300]  Hmm do you have a gang sir, maybe big sir or see l cap that's like a part of Yosemite, right?
[25:56.300 --> 26:01.180]  I'm not too caught up in the geography either. Yeah, I think it is right and so
[26:02.020 --> 26:06.580]  This update from what I'm hearing is not going to be a huge update
[26:07.300 --> 26:14.900]  Functionality wise or user interface wise so maybe going with OS 10 l caps kind of like build off of that
[26:14.900 --> 26:18.060]  You're somebody name could make sense. Ooh, that's a good guess
[26:18.060 --> 26:22.900]  I've heard the same thing and it's not just I know you've reported this but I've heard and especially
[26:23.660 --> 26:28.060]  Which we should definitely talk we could we can tie this in together, but sure
[26:28.060 --> 26:31.780]  I think you I don't want to I don't want to put words in your mouth
[26:31.780 --> 26:38.200]  But I think you've reported that in both cases with both OS is there's more of an emphasis on on
[26:38.200 --> 26:47.120]  Cleaning up the edge cases and the details and bug fixes and refinements, you know, not quite as
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.640]  Drastic maybe as snow leopard was but that sort of OS update, but I think it's deaf from what I've heard
[26:53.640 --> 27:00.420]  That's more the case with OS 10 than with iOS. Yep. I heard the exact same thing. So
[27:00.940 --> 27:07.580]  On iOS, it's kind of like meeting in the middle maybe with a snow leopard and like a standard annual upgrade
[27:07.580 --> 27:13.140]  so they're really focusing on making sure it works well through the QA processes and
[27:13.500 --> 27:20.660]  Performance and efficiency wise but also adding new features but on OS 10 the only user facing new feature
[27:20.660 --> 27:26.980]  I've heard about is control center. Hmm interesting. Yeah, I don't I actually don't know of anything
[27:29.060 --> 27:32.560]  Yeah, I don't know of anything and I only know about control center because of you
[27:32.560 --> 27:39.760]  Yeah, and there's like a lot of little things that they'll have on OS 10. Like we talked about San Francisco for the font. Yeah
[27:40.480 --> 27:42.480]  Have you heard that as well by the way, I have
[27:43.080 --> 27:49.020]  Okay, and I've spoken to people who've seen it on iOS 9. I don't know of anybody who's seen it on OS 10
[27:49.600 --> 27:55.880]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you can speak to this too, but it's not the exact same San Francisco as on the Apple Watch
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.800]  You know kind of a little bit more curved. Yeah, maybe like the activity app that is on the iPhone right now
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.400]  Well, I don't know the details of exactly what changes they made, but I am absolutely
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.400]  Positively convinced that it's not the same
[28:11.800 --> 28:19.080]  Digitized version that's on the watch right because if you ran that hack that came out last year that let you I
[28:19.720 --> 28:23.000]  Didn't I don't think that anybody I don't know. I don't have a jailbroken device
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.200]  So I couldn't try it on iOS 9 but I know on OS 10
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.480]  There was the thing on github you download the the version of the font from Apple with a developer account
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.580]  You run a little script and it makes a version of the font that if you put it in system
[28:36.040 --> 28:42.020]  Library fonts and when you reboot your Mac, it'll use that instead of the system's version of Helvetica, Noia
[28:42.840 --> 28:46.100]  And it didn't look bad, but it didn't look right
[28:46.800 --> 28:50.680]  You kind of shift it off a little bit it screwed with the menu bar. So
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.480]  yeah, just just in terms of being like a
[28:54.480 --> 28:59.760]  a person who's super finicky and about typography it just
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.280]  Didn't have the right feel to it
[29:02.280 --> 29:07.360]  Like it's just a feel of it thing not a think of it thing not there's no real way to put it in words
[29:07.360 --> 29:11.360]  and I think the reason why is that the version of San Francisco that Apple
[29:12.080 --> 29:14.080]  crafted for the watch is
[29:14.800 --> 29:16.120]  shockingly
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.400]  Designed to look best at the tiny little sizes that you see it on the watch
[29:21.400 --> 29:25.820]  It's surprising right right, which are way smaller than then
[29:25.820 --> 29:30.120]  That's what the 16-point font that you see in the menu bar on the Mac
[29:31.020 --> 29:35.740]  So there, you know, it's just like a lot of modern-day digital fonts
[29:35.740 --> 29:41.320]  It's you know different optical sizes have different kerning and different details to certain of the glyphs, right?
[29:41.320 --> 29:43.620]  And I think you touched upon this in an earlier podcast
[29:43.760 --> 29:46.380]  I think maybe it was with Dan from or something
[29:46.380 --> 29:48.840]  They kind of you said I think is you I don't put words in your mouth
[29:48.840 --> 29:52.800]  That they're maybe partially doing this because they want to own the whole experience
[29:52.800 --> 29:58.640]  Yeah, I have to license a font from other providers. Well, they're still gonna have that font
[29:58.640 --> 30:01.440]  So they still have to license it. There's no way they're getting rid of Helvetica
[30:02.360 --> 30:07.600]  But this way they have a look that can't be copied. Okay, right. Yeah, that's you know what I mean?
[30:07.600 --> 30:11.420]  So like HTC has used Helvetica Neue for years
[30:12.240 --> 30:16.360]  in like their custom skin for Android, you know and
[30:16.360 --> 30:23.360]  And honestly, it makes their you know, like their lock screen look a lot better than the other Android devices
[30:23.440 --> 30:30.040]  Yeah, absolutely. It's a good fun. But this will put like similarity across Apple's platforms. It's good marketing wise
[30:30.560 --> 30:36.320]  You know, they did the whole revamp of the OS in 13 for iOS 7 and last year for the Mac
[30:36.320 --> 30:42.760]  I think changing up the font a little bit keeps everything fresh. Yeah, and I think that you know
[30:42.760 --> 30:46.720]  there's been other people have written about it in in detail, but
[30:47.960 --> 30:49.960]  Helvetica's
[30:50.600 --> 30:56.000]  It's almost hard to talk about it because it's so it's a ubiquitous font but it's not that
[30:57.280 --> 31:04.640]  Perfectly suited as a UI font and a you user interface font has to meaning the font for things like the labels on buttons
[31:05.120 --> 31:11.400]  The menus, you know the the chrome of the OS as opposed to the content within it
[31:11.400 --> 31:14.600]  It's just not that great for it. It's not really a great
[31:15.480 --> 31:19.960]  Font for that. It's not bad and it looks better on retina screens then
[31:20.840 --> 31:22.840]  Lucida Grande did
[31:23.040 --> 31:30.240]  Great, but San Francisco does there's it's sort of like being a little bit more industrial and a little bit more sturdy where it's you
[31:30.240 --> 31:33.040]  Wouldn't want to read long passages. I'm suspecting
[31:34.120 --> 31:40.360]  For example, like when you open mail, you're still gonna see the contents of your messages in Helvetica Neue
[31:40.360 --> 31:46.120]  It's the labels and the chrome of the OS that'll be San Francisco. I could be wrong. Maybe they'll really
[31:46.520 --> 31:51.880]  Maybe they'll go to San Francisco for content as well. Although I'd be really surprised if they did that on the Mac
[31:52.040 --> 31:57.640]  It's gonna be interesting to see if third-party developers come out with lots of updates to support San Francisco
[31:57.640 --> 32:03.400]  Now like there were all sorts of retina display and touch ID API updates over the years whenever they well
[32:03.840 --> 32:09.040]  You should it should just happen automatically because what they should be doing in the user interface is not
[32:09.040 --> 32:16.400]  Specifying Helvetica Neue but specifying system font, right? Right, but not all developers do that, right? Especially the custom graphics ones
[32:18.020 --> 32:20.660]  No, but I've heard I've heard the same thing, yeah
[32:21.520 --> 32:24.600]  Yeah, so tell me what you know about control center for OS 10
[32:25.180 --> 32:27.020]  So before Yosemite came out
[32:27.020 --> 32:34.340]  They were like the internal builds for Apple employees if you swiped on the left side of your trackpad the exact opposite for how you open
[32:34.340 --> 32:40.260]  Notification Center control center would come out and it would actually move some of the menu bar to the side
[32:40.460 --> 32:45.120]  So the about this Mac Wi-Fi controls volume controls
[32:45.740 --> 32:50.460]  I think some battery indicator things to access system preferences more quickly
[32:51.500 --> 32:55.340]  Brightness music controls similar to how it is on iOS
[32:56.020 --> 32:57.580]  Bluetooth
[32:57.580 --> 33:00.940]  Maybe they'll replicate the menu bar but not remove the menu bar
[33:00.940 --> 33:06.140]  So you can access it on either side or maybe they'll just won't ship it with control center altogether
[33:06.140 --> 33:08.780]  But it's basically what you think it would be
[33:09.140 --> 33:14.860]  Yeah, I I think that part of it is where whenever Apple comes up with something new it always
[33:15.420 --> 33:22.680]  Helps me to think just take a big step back and just think well why and I one thing I could think of when I read
[33:22.680 --> 33:24.060]  that is
[33:24.060 --> 33:26.060]  all these tiny little
[33:26.060 --> 33:31.840]  Icons in the menu bar have always been to me a bit of a hack user interface wise
[33:32.220 --> 33:39.300]  Like the thing that makes sense in the menu bar are just the menus file edit view history bookmarks
[33:39.300 --> 33:41.380]  You can see I'm in Safari, right?
[33:42.340 --> 33:49.100]  Those little status things have never really felt at home up there and I know why they're there
[33:49.100 --> 33:52.180]  It's because you want them to be accessible quickly
[33:52.180 --> 33:59.300]  Like here quick. How do I turn my sound down? Okay, I'll go up there to this speaker thing and drag a menu down
[33:59.980 --> 34:02.340]  But it's never really felt right to me
[34:02.340 --> 34:08.420]  I don't know how to say it semantically grammatically in terms of the user interface and there was a time
[34:08.420 --> 34:09.780]  I don't know if you remember this
[34:09.780 --> 34:14.900]  There was a time in the early days of OS 10 where they were like I'm gonna I don't remember the names
[34:14.900 --> 34:16.620]  But there were two ways to write those
[34:16.620 --> 34:22.380]  menu things and there was one that was using a private API and Apple used it and another using the
[34:23.060 --> 34:25.060]  public API and
[34:25.820 --> 34:32.700]  You know developers, but they wanted to do the extra stuff the private API could do so they use that one and you know
[34:32.700 --> 34:34.860]  All sorts of ugliness ensued
[34:35.820 --> 34:40.100]  Do you think they'll offer a way for developers to tap into control center on the Mac?
[34:40.540 --> 34:42.180]  Yeah, yeah, I do
[34:42.180 --> 34:43.500]  I think if they come out with it
[34:43.500 --> 34:48.700]  They definitely would in the same way that they you know have with the like today widgets, right?
[34:49.740 --> 34:51.140]  control
[34:51.140 --> 34:52.640]  Well, especially on the Mac
[34:52.640 --> 34:58.860]  I think they're way more likely to give developers access to new things like that on the Mac than they are on iOS
[34:59.380 --> 35:02.660]  Right because iOS control center is not it's not really touchable
[35:02.820 --> 35:03.580]  No
[35:03.580 --> 35:09.980]  But I think that they would and I think the reason that they would is I think going all the way back to Mac OS
[35:09.980 --> 35:14.700]  10.0 way back when you know when you were like two years old
[35:15.780 --> 35:17.220]  Thanks
[35:17.220 --> 35:24.300]  I don't think Apple has ever liked the idea of third parties putting stuff up in the menu bar the little icon menus
[35:24.660 --> 35:29.580]  Just is you know, just like it's just a little bit gross and it kind of looks terrible, too
[35:29.580 --> 35:34.100]  Just as an eyesore when they were doing the retina transition some of those icons weren't retina yet
[35:34.100 --> 35:38.140]  So you'd have like a retina Apple one and then a third party that's all pixelated, right?
[35:38.140 --> 35:44.940]  Yeah, and what's and what's the what is the highest profile piece of hardware that Apple has released so far this year
[35:45.740 --> 35:50.140]  of course the the Mark Gurman MacBook, we had the Mark Gurman MacBook and
[35:51.420 --> 35:55.980]  Guess what? The Mark Gurman MacBook has a very small screen. Yep
[35:56.700 --> 36:00.460]  and those icons run up against the side of
[36:01.340 --> 36:02.860]  The app, you know
[36:02.860 --> 36:09.140]  It's very very easy to have so many icons up there that an app with a lot of menus like Xcode or something like that
[36:09.140 --> 36:11.980]  That they run into each other. That's a good point. I don't even think of that
[36:12.620 --> 36:17.820]  Yeah, yeah, I want to move it on the iPad too because on the iPad you swipe up for it
[36:17.820 --> 36:19.820]  What if they move it to the side on that as well?
[36:21.060 --> 36:23.200]  hmm, I don't think so I
[36:24.620 --> 36:28.500]  Know I don't think so because I think the iPad follows the iPhone
[36:28.500 --> 36:33.620]  You're on the phone, you know, it really needs to come up from the bottom down from the side. Sure
[36:33.620 --> 36:38.140]  Sure, like I feel like with the iPad if the iPad lived in its own universe
[36:38.300 --> 36:42.100]  It wouldn't make much difference whether it was a thing from the side or a thing from the bottom
[36:42.100 --> 36:47.740]  But because it's like it's really just a big iPhone. It's got to come up from the bottom. Mmm. Yeah, I
[36:48.380 --> 36:55.160]  Think the only things that Apple likes up there is the status stuff the right time time the battery
[36:55.160 --> 37:01.280]  And you know the spotlight and what do you call it? What's the
[37:02.160 --> 37:10.520]  Notification Center. Yeah, you know the spotlight icon being there is interesting because when they came out with spotlight with tiger up through
[37:11.300 --> 37:16.020]  Whatever was before Yosemite a Mavericks you would have a little pop out in the top right corner
[37:16.200 --> 37:19.760]  But now you're clicking this magnifying glass in the top right corner
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.240]  But the text field pops up in the middle of the screen so that doesn't make much sense
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.600]  Yeah, you're actually right now that I think about it
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.760]  So maybe they'll get rid of that entirely and just tell people to do the the command spacebar
[37:32.200 --> 37:34.440]  right, and if you're the sort of person who's
[37:35.100 --> 37:41.440]  Doesn't think about using a command line thing then spotlights not for you. Anyway, maybe maybe it moves to the dock
[37:42.800 --> 37:46.320]  Yeah, you know they have the icon for spotlight in the file system
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.380]  Anyways, they always have so right maybe or a quick mouse at the corner hot shortcut or something
[37:52.380 --> 37:54.900]  Yeah, I don't know. That's a good point
[37:57.780 --> 38:01.820]  Yeah, I haven't heard anything else about OS 10 I think that
[38:02.980 --> 38:06.260]  There probably has got to be a few things, you know, I I do
[38:07.140 --> 38:12.340]  Expect I just think that there's got to be a few things but I do think that it's a lot more like a snow leopard
[38:12.340 --> 38:13.900]  Style release. Yeah, absolutely
[38:13.900 --> 38:18.540]  I mean I heard there's a big focus on security with this new feature called rootless
[38:18.540 --> 38:23.900]  Which sort of blocks the file system from being as accessible as it is now
[38:24.260 --> 38:28.120]  The finder won't go away people will still be able to get into the file system
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.320]  But like the root directories and such will be will be hidden
[38:32.100 --> 38:37.700]  Yeah, that's a good. It's an interesting feature and that's in to my knowledge. It's entirely a
[38:39.200 --> 38:42.220]  German scoop and you know everything I've ever seen about it
[38:42.220 --> 38:48.980]  It ultimately it's somewhere at the bottom of the article says as first reported by marker on a nine-to-five mark
[38:49.140 --> 38:49.660]  Yeah
[38:49.660 --> 38:53.620]  It might be more of an iOS thing because it was designed initially to sort of break
[38:54.020 --> 38:58.500]  Jailbreaks in the future from people people being able to tap deep into the system
[38:58.780 --> 39:05.100]  But there's some ways to apply it to the Mac as well. Hmm. Yeah, I can see it and I think it ties into
[39:07.060 --> 39:10.300]  You know, obviously it's you first think of it as a security feature
[39:10.300 --> 39:14.380]  but I think Apple more and more sees
[39:15.300 --> 39:21.220]  security and privacy is being intertwined and then it's it's it's the sort of
[39:22.460 --> 39:26.620]  doubling down on features like this has as much to do with their
[39:27.060 --> 39:34.380]  Their stance on privacy as it does on any sort of just the the general principle that you want your OS to be secure
[39:34.380 --> 39:41.380]  Right, and it also goes back to the big picture stuff of a bigger quality stability focus not loading people tap
[39:41.660 --> 39:46.020]  Into the core parts of the system will likely keep the OS stabler overall
[39:46.460 --> 39:52.940]  Yeah, the privacy thing is a good point because there was all that there's been a lot of talk about a Siri API
[39:53.740 --> 39:57.300]  Mmm, and I know and I'm sure you heard this as well that at some point
[39:57.300 --> 40:00.660]  They were considering a full-fledged way for developers to tap into Siri
[40:00.660 --> 40:07.700]  Yes, but from what I understand they keep holding back on that because they're concerned about the privacy implications
[40:07.700 --> 40:11.740]  So let's say you give a command to Siri and you're trying to tap into Yelp
[40:12.340 --> 40:16.380]  but what if Siri misinterprets what you said and sends your data to
[40:17.780 --> 40:19.780]  another app a Google app or
[40:20.100 --> 40:21.660]  Shazam or something like that
[40:21.660 --> 40:28.340]  So they're concerned that Siri might send data the wrong place because it misinterprets what you said. So, hmm. Yeah, I could see that
[40:28.340 --> 40:35.500]  It's an interesting thing or I I just off the top of my head that if they opened it up to third parties
[40:38.780 --> 40:45.040]  Even if they made it and I suspect that they would I suspect that I'm a Mac
[40:47.020 --> 40:49.540]  Well, I on iOS it would definitely
[40:50.700 --> 40:52.700]  You know, everything goes through the App Store
[40:52.700 --> 40:56.460]  But even if they did it on the Mac, which doesn't really have proper Siri at anyway
[40:56.460 --> 41:02.180]  but if they if they did I would see them as doing it only for Mac App Store apps because
[41:02.620 --> 41:07.340]  I think they would want to approve the apps because they wouldn't want it used in any
[41:07.580 --> 41:14.520]  Context where what you might be saying to Siri is stuff that Apple does not want going to their servers for whatever reason
[41:14.520 --> 41:16.520]  I'm not you know, no, that makes a lot of sense
[41:17.380 --> 41:20.940]  Read into that what you will but I don't think that they want you saying, you know
[41:20.940 --> 41:26.260]  They don't want you even something I'm not even you know, there's you know porno or you know
[41:26.260 --> 41:31.700]  pirating movies or something like that any sorts of stuff that they might not want to be involved with but even something like that that
[41:31.820 --> 41:36.620]  On the surface is on the up-and-up like a medical records app. They're not gonna want you
[41:37.380 --> 41:42.580]  But on the other hand, I guess they still allow it for dictation and that stuff still round trips to the server
[41:42.580 --> 41:45.820]  So, I don't know right? I don't know. All I know is that
[41:47.100 --> 41:49.100]  the the privacy thing is
[41:49.540 --> 41:51.540]  from everything I've heard is
[41:51.540 --> 41:53.540]  super super super
[41:53.540 --> 42:00.980]  Top priority across the company. It's legit. It's not like a marketing thing. It's no it's what they really actually focus on
[42:01.400 --> 42:07.020]  You can't say that for everything they do but this is this is a real this is a real concern for them
[42:07.020 --> 42:10.820]  I do think they will do something not a full-fledged your API
[42:10.820 --> 42:17.560]  But that deep linking app indexing feature that Google announced a couple weeks ago. I think that's gonna
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.620]  Be an iOS 9. It's under the codename breadcrumbs, which kind of is like leading a trail of your app to be able to be
[42:24.220 --> 42:28.580]  Indexed by Siri and spotlight and so something a little smaller scale. Hmm
[42:29.300 --> 42:33.900]  Yeah, I could see that and it sure would be good if you could
[42:35.300 --> 42:36.660]  You know
[42:36.660 --> 42:38.660]  like if you use
[42:39.060 --> 42:44.500]  Things, you know and that you could say hey Siri tell things to add
[42:44.500 --> 42:48.420]  Blah-blah-blah to my next up list
[42:48.980 --> 42:55.580]  right have that parse correctly and I know things maybe is a bad example because I know things like a bunch of to-do apps
[42:55.900 --> 43:02.820]  Can integrate with your system-wide reminders list just to get stuff into your inbox, but there's no way to do like a custom
[43:03.460 --> 43:07.780]  Just it only makes sense in the context of this app Siri input, right?
[43:07.780 --> 43:10.740]  And they kind of hacked it like I know and I use things in their settings
[43:10.740 --> 43:18.020]  They they talk about like reminders plus Siri and integrating that with things so they recognize that I think a few other apps as well
[43:18.020 --> 43:20.180]  Have right and you know
[43:20.180 --> 43:27.260]  There's just all sorts of apps where Siri specific input like if Siri could be as smart about a third-party app as it is about
[43:27.580 --> 43:30.220]  Some of the built-in stuff. It would be great, right?
[43:32.820 --> 43:37.140]  Well, hold on and then let's talk about what's coming that's the up next remind me
[43:37.140 --> 43:41.980]  We'll talk about what what we think is coming up or what, you know is coming up next in iOS 9
[43:41.980 --> 43:44.500]  But let me take a second break here and thank
[43:45.140 --> 43:51.260]  Our next sponsor these guys were here last week. They're back again our good friend at mail route ma
[43:51.660 --> 43:54.660]  Il ro you te
[43:55.660 --> 44:02.060]  Here's their pitch, you know who should be handling your email email nerds who do nothing but email
[44:02.060 --> 44:08.260]  These guys and mail route, that's all they do. They created the first cloud-based email filtering solution
[44:08.260 --> 44:12.340]  And then they sold it to Microsoft now, they're back with mail route. They've been there for a couple of years
[44:13.340 --> 44:15.340]  And it's such a simple
[44:16.660 --> 44:23.580]  Beautiful pitch it's just super effective spam and virus filtering for your own
[44:24.300 --> 44:26.300]  Email that you host yourself
[44:26.780 --> 44:27.780]  so
[44:27.780 --> 44:34.780]  So imagine a world with no spam. No viruses. No bounce mail. That's what it's like with mail route. They don't host your email
[44:35.460 --> 44:38.780]  You have your own domain you run your own mail server or you have you know
[44:38.780 --> 44:43.780]  You go to somebody like fast mail or something like that where you have email that's under your own control
[44:45.140 --> 44:46.780]  What you do, but you have your own domain name
[44:46.780 --> 44:53.980]  What you do is you point your MX records at mail route and then your mail goes through their filters first and then whatever
[44:53.980 --> 44:58.980]  Passes through their filters goes on to your mail server. Just a little front end
[44:58.980 --> 45:06.980]  Just like think of it as like a screen in the window in between the outside world and your mail server and it can make a tremendous
[45:07.980 --> 45:15.980]  Tremendous difference in the amount of spam that gets they're super accurate on both sides super low for false positives super low false negatives
[45:15.980 --> 45:20.980]  I don't even know how they do it. I don't know how their their spam filtering is as accurate as it is
[45:20.980 --> 45:27.980]  They have a great feature. So everybody every every email account in under your control can get a
[45:28.980 --> 45:32.980]  Quarantine report on a regular basis and what that means is you get an email
[45:32.980 --> 45:39.980]  from mail route in your inbox that would just say here's the emails that we were sort of like maybe on and
[45:40.980 --> 45:43.980]  You can look through that list and instead of looking through like
[45:43.980 --> 45:49.980]  5,000 I've got I've got an email address over here. I swear to God and it's not on a in front of mail route
[45:49.980 --> 45:54.980]  Although I should I just don't use this domain that much anymore has over 5,000 spams in the inbox right now
[45:54.980 --> 45:56.980]  I know that they're all almost all spam
[45:56.980 --> 46:00.980]  It's an address that I've used like just for ordering stuff online in the past
[46:01.980 --> 46:03.980]  Mail route can filter all that crap out
[46:03.980 --> 46:08.980]  but then you can get a report this quarantine report and it'll say here's seven that we were like a
[46:08.980 --> 46:14.980]  Maybe on like these aren't we're not really sure I ball that list if you see one that actually wasn't spam
[46:14.980 --> 46:18.980]  You're like two clicks away from whitelisting that and then it'll never get flagged again
[46:18.980 --> 46:25.980]  But that way you don't have to go through all five thousand emails that they did flag a spam and look for the false positives
[46:25.980 --> 46:30.980]  They give you this quarantine list. That is great. It just it just gives you the ones that they were like maybe on
[46:31.980 --> 46:33.980]  And there's very few of those
[46:33.980 --> 46:39.980]  Super easy to set up super reliable and because you're just pointing you're just redirecting your MX record to go to mail route
[46:39.980 --> 46:44.980]  First then onto your server. It's so easy to try and if you don't like it
[46:44.980 --> 46:49.980]  Although I can't imagine why that would be I've never heard of anybody who's tried it and not stuck with it because it's so accurate
[46:49.980 --> 46:53.980]  But if if that's the case, all you have to do is change your MX record back
[46:53.980 --> 46:59.980]  You don't have to change your email settings on your phone and on your laptop and on your thing
[46:59.980 --> 47:06.980]  You don't have to copy your mail from you know, these big huge gigabyte archives of your old mail from one server to another
[47:06.980 --> 47:09.980]  You're just changing your MX record. So it's super super easy
[47:10.980 --> 47:17.980]  If you're an IT pro, they've got all sorts of API's and tools, you know that anything you'd want to do if you're like an email admin
[47:17.980 --> 47:22.980]  Super super advanced, but if you just want to hook it up and have it filter out all the junk it's so easy to do
[47:22.980 --> 47:28.980]  They've got all sorts of other stuff LDAP and Active Directory TLS mail bagging. I don't even know what that is
[47:28.980 --> 47:35.980]  Outbound relay anything you want from people handling your mail mail route handles it. They've got great customer support really really great
[47:35.980 --> 47:40.980]  So here's what you do. Go to mail route dot net mail route dot net slash
[47:40.980 --> 47:47.980]  TTS TTS for the talk show and you'll get a free trial and then when you sign up for the talk show
[47:47.980 --> 47:55.980]  And you'll get a free trial and then when you sign up to pay you get 10% off for the lifetime of your account
[47:55.980 --> 47:59.980]  Mail route dot net slash TTS. My thanks to mail route
[47:59.980 --> 48:07.980]  Great service to get spam me all the time. Probably like a hundred of them a day
[48:07.980 --> 48:14.980]  I sometimes I think about email. It's like can you even imagine anybody sitting up a new service today?
[48:14.980 --> 48:20.980]  Where it was like you have a public address and anybody else on the entire internet can just send stuff to you
[48:20.980 --> 48:25.980]  It's crazy. I mean, I hardly read email seriously anymore
[48:25.980 --> 48:33.980]  I go through every morning when I wake up on my phone and I'm basically selecting all most of the time looking out for names
[48:33.980 --> 48:40.980]  I recognize or important domains and such but otherwise it's spam. Yeah, it's it's so crazy
[48:40.980 --> 48:47.980]  John Cercuso and Merlin Mann have a new podcast and they were talking about Cercuso was talking about being in college in the 90s
[48:47.980 --> 48:49.980]  He was a little bit younger than me
[48:49.980 --> 48:53.980]  But at his college to get on the internet before they had it and even like, you know
[48:53.980 --> 48:58.980]  Like Ethernet connections in the dorm rooms, he'd go to the lab and there are these VT 100 terminals
[48:58.980 --> 49:02.980]  So do you ever see those that really it was just you know, what you think of the terminal app?
[49:02.980 --> 49:06.980]  It was a computer that that's all it was was a term. Yeah, sure, but they didn't have email
[49:06.980 --> 49:13.980]  Well, you'd log in now and then you'd get your email you'd get your mail on, you know using like elm or pine or one of those apps
[49:13.980 --> 49:20.980]  But the the fact was like that I remember this it was the same way at Drexel where I went where the terminals themselves were
[49:20.980 --> 49:27.980]  World writable. So if you knew the terminal name next to you, you could just write characters to the screen of that terminal
[49:27.980 --> 49:29.980]  Oh, wow, and you know
[49:29.980 --> 49:37.980]  so it was a great way to prank people in the lab because the assumption was it's like the entire early internet was sort of like
[49:37.980 --> 49:42.980]  Built on academic rules. Like why would anybody do that? This is you know, we're all in this together
[49:42.980 --> 49:48.980]  Sort of thinking. Yeah, it's kind of like iCloud but vintage, right?
[49:48.980 --> 49:56.980]  It's sort of like, you know, it's just was crazy and email is like this bizarre holdover from that that system
[49:56.980 --> 50:03.980]  Yeah, it's amazing to me that Apple isn't playing in that email space. You see Dropbox trying it
[50:03.980 --> 50:12.980]  Facebook with their messaging and all that and iCloud email in the mail apps on iOS and OS 10
[50:12.980 --> 50:16.980]  It's basically just like how email was handled five ten years ago
[50:16.980 --> 50:22.980]  I really think that if anyone would to you know, come in here and innovate in some way in the email space
[50:22.980 --> 50:28.980]  It could be Apple but here they are doing nothing at least publicly. Yeah, that's interesting. I never really thought about that but
[50:28.980 --> 50:37.980]  Presumably in the same way that anybody who can I message each other if they came out with their own Apple specific
[50:37.980 --> 50:42.980]  Apple to Apple email 2.0 type thing, you know
[50:42.980 --> 50:47.980]  Just as many people who can get blue bubbles with each other and I message could send you know
[50:47.980 --> 50:52.980]  Some kind of new email type thing to each other or maybe they'll just you know
[50:52.980 --> 50:58.980]  Beef up I message and try to make email go away. Yeah, I almost feel like that would be the way that they would go
[50:58.980 --> 51:04.980]  Yeah, probably because they just it would be easier for them to put it all in one or maybe not easier
[51:04.980 --> 51:12.980]  That seems like the more Apple way. Yeah, like males legacy and I messages is the new thing. Yeah, I wonder how much
[51:12.980 --> 51:18.980]  I wonder how much of their communication takes place on I message internally now because I know it used to be they you know
[51:18.980 --> 51:23.980]  Probably still are but I know they used to be an incredibly email reliant
[51:23.980 --> 51:28.980]  Company that they didn't really have any kind of complex
[51:28.980 --> 51:36.980]  I don't know what you would call it intranet style messaging type thing that you know most communication within the company took place by email
[51:36.980 --> 51:43.980]  Yeah, they probably use slack these days like everyone else. Well, they definitely have some teams on slack because remember when there was that
[51:43.980 --> 51:59.980]  There was a thing where you could type in a domain name and and see how many people you know, how many slack teams were registered for that domain
[51:59.980 --> 52:07.980]  Ah, yeah, and and it was the idea was slack added the feature to make it easy for you to connect
[52:07.980 --> 52:14.980]  you know, like if I think it was like you would type in like at nine to five Mac calm and then it would like
[52:14.980 --> 52:19.980]  Help, you know trying to help you it would be like, ah, here's the teams for your organization
[52:19.980 --> 52:24.980]  Which one do you want to join but that meant though that you could just take a guess and type in at microsoft.com
[52:24.980 --> 52:30.980]  And it would like tell you here's all the teams from your company that are in slack. Oh, wow. I wish I knew that
[52:30.980 --> 52:36.980]  Probably could have figured out they had a car team. Yeah, I want no I don't think I don't think there was anything
[52:36.980 --> 52:39.980]  I don't recall anything. Yeah, I don't think there was anything that
[52:39.980 --> 52:43.980]  Was telling I think they were kind of smart about it, but it was yeah, I'm just kidding
[52:43.980 --> 52:48.980]  But I'll try to look it up for the show notes. That's a big I can't believe slack even thought that would be a even half
[52:48.980 --> 52:53.980]  Good idea to launch something like that public. Well, you know what though it's exactly like
[52:53.980 --> 52:59.980]  It's that it is you're right and I'm sure that they were slapping themselves on the forehead over it
[52:59.980 --> 53:04.980]  But it's like when you are a good person and you're just trying to help somebody it is right
[53:04.980 --> 53:08.980]  It's so easy to overlook the you know
[53:09.980 --> 53:16.980]  What if you're a jerk? Right, right that somebody wrote an article a while ago that everybody needs like a
[53:16.980 --> 53:23.980]  Like a chief jerk officer who looks at everything and just says okay, but what if I'm a jerk?
[53:23.980 --> 53:25.980]  Right, right. That's a good point. Yeah
[53:28.980 --> 53:34.980]  So iOS 9 yeah, here's where there's a lot more action going on
[53:34.980 --> 53:38.980]  Right. So what do we know? We know San Francisco, right?
[53:38.980 --> 53:43.980]  We know that user interface wise besides the font. It's gonna look pretty much the same
[53:43.980 --> 53:49.980]  I heard some new splash of colors color changes on some icons some user interface elements
[53:49.980 --> 53:56.980]  But if you didn't know the difference between Helvetica and San Francisco, you'd think would be iOS 8
[53:56.980 --> 53:59.980]  I know
[53:59.980 --> 54:06.980]  We know about maps maps is getting a big upgrade so transit finally
[54:06.980 --> 54:12.980]  They wanted that out the door last year and I guess they're ready now, but it's only going to be in a handful of cities
[54:12.980 --> 54:17.980]  So San Francisco, New York, Toronto, London
[54:18.980 --> 54:24.980]  Berlin Paris and they want Boston and Tokyo by the end of the year
[54:24.980 --> 54:29.980]  Also, they're gonna have China launch sort of a small-scale rollout. Yeah, but
[54:30.980 --> 54:35.980]  Starting the funny thing though about hitting those cities is that yes
[54:35.980 --> 54:38.980]  It sounds like a short list of cities and it's you know
[54:38.980 --> 54:43.980]  Clearly they are behind Google on this regard because Google has transit information all over the world
[54:43.980 --> 54:47.980]  but if you can get like the top 10 cities you you
[54:47.980 --> 54:53.980]  Hit an enormous number of the people who need the transit information because they're so population dense
[54:53.980 --> 54:59.980]  Right, and I think they're gonna move quickly on this because I know that this new version is gonna have a notification system
[54:59.980 --> 55:04.980]  That you can be alerted when transit arrives in your city
[55:04.980 --> 55:09.980]  So they're planning on updating this frequently over the year and they have a whole roadmap of where they want to hit
[55:09.980 --> 55:13.980]  At what times in the future right like the big thing is having transit
[55:13.980 --> 55:20.980]  Is it the architecture for transit in general right OS and then after that they can do over-the-air updates, you know?
[55:21.980 --> 55:28.980]  iOS 9.1 or even 9.02 or something like that and it adds, you know new cities around right or even
[55:28.980 --> 55:33.980]  Over the air without a software update just through the backend infrastructure, right? Maybe yeah
[55:33.980 --> 55:35.980]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case, right?
[55:35.980 --> 55:41.980]  But I mean if you were to say three cities in North America that if you can only hit three, I think they got those three
[55:42.980 --> 55:44.980]  Which ones would you say New York?
[55:45.980 --> 55:49.980]  Or maybe Chicago. Yeah, but you're thinking it Los Angeles. What were you thinking?
[55:49.980 --> 55:54.980]  You know Los Angeles because when I asked whoever I was talking to their Los Angeles is actually
[55:55.980 --> 56:02.980]  Extremely and surprisingly low on the on the list over they want to hit but Los Angeles is a driving city anyway
[56:02.980 --> 56:08.980]  Right, that's exactly why it wasn't why I put Chicago above it. Yeah, I didn't think of Chicago, but they got Toronto, San Francisco
[56:08.980 --> 56:14.980]  New York. Yeah, maybe Chicago later. We'll see. Yeah, and I know Boston has a great
[56:15.980 --> 56:22.980]  Infrastructure for it like Philadelphia is weird city for it. I don't I know that there's some information of our public transportation
[56:22.980 --> 56:24.980]  Organization is called SEPTA
[56:24.980 --> 56:26.980]  Southeast Pennsylvania
[56:26.980 --> 56:28.980]  transportation authority
[56:28.980 --> 56:30.980]  but I think that there's
[56:30.980 --> 56:37.620]  Really behind a lot of the other cities like the when I was visiting friends in Boston last year like you you could it says
[56:37.620 --> 56:42.200]  Like hey your bus is coming in 45 seconds and like your bus is coming in 45 seconds
[56:43.340 --> 56:49.860]  Maybe that's why Boston is not ready because they want to integrate that functionality. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why boss
[56:49.860 --> 56:54.220]  Maybe I think maybe it's still that goes by population though. I mean, I don't know
[56:54.220 --> 56:59.040]  I know they really wanted Boston. It just wasn't ready. Yeah. No, I don't know and you know
[56:59.040 --> 57:02.820]  I think all these API's are different, you know and all the different or you know
[57:02.820 --> 57:08.420]  I I've from what I've read about it that there's no like unifying standard and that one of the reasons that
[57:10.540 --> 57:14.340]  Google has had a years-long lead at this is that Google it
[57:14.340 --> 57:18.860]  This is the sort of thing Google is good at and if every single city reports this transportation
[57:19.460 --> 57:23.900]  Information in a different way Google's really good at saying that's okay. We'll make sense of it
[57:23.900 --> 57:31.420]  Yeah, even if it's not like uniform, I would guess that Apple could take if they only did two cities San Francisco in New York
[57:31.420 --> 57:38.680]  It would it would hit an awful lot of the usage and the entirety of China. So right, that's a big one there
[57:39.300 --> 57:41.300]  Yeah, yeah
[57:42.500 --> 57:45.740]  Yeah, I guess China it might even be more important
[57:45.740 --> 57:49.700]  I think China that the number of people who take public transportation has got to be insane
[57:49.700 --> 57:54.500]  Yeah, but the interesting thing about China is that there's some legal government
[57:55.300 --> 58:02.660]  Monopoly on Alibaba who owns Auto Navi. So Apple is not allowed to do their own transit data collection in China
[58:02.660 --> 58:09.100]  So they've actually, you know struck a deal with Alibaba to get the the data from them for China
[58:09.300 --> 58:11.300]  Hmm. I wonder what the difference will be
[58:12.260 --> 58:14.980]  Yeah, I don't know probably reliability. Yeah
[58:14.980 --> 58:16.980]  Anything
[58:18.300 --> 58:19.820]  Else for maps
[58:19.820 --> 58:24.680]  Yeah, so those vans that they've been driving around are for a few things one
[58:24.680 --> 58:31.200]  They're redoing their entire base map the geography fundamentals of the map app, but and they're wanting to launch that by
[58:32.000 --> 58:39.340]  2017 or 18 so the trucks are doing verification on that data, but they're also taking pictures of
[58:39.340 --> 58:45.340]  Storefront so a lot of people thought these were a street view cameras like what Google does and they do collect data like that
[58:45.980 --> 58:47.940]  For 3d stuff that they're gonna do in the future
[58:47.940 --> 58:52.700]  but the more short-term thing is taking pictures of like a Chipotle or
[58:53.780 --> 58:59.460]  Storefront for an office to replace Yelp. So right now when you go into a place in the maps app
[58:59.840 --> 59:01.500]  Let's say you go to a restaurant
[59:01.500 --> 59:06.980]  It'll show you a picture of a menu item at the top taken by someone who uploaded it to Yelp
[59:06.980 --> 59:09.780]  And a lot of times those pictures are very poor quality
[59:10.340 --> 59:13.580]  So Apple stepping back and saying hey, we want to do this ourselves
[59:13.700 --> 59:19.600]  So they're taking stills of storefronts and the plan was to start rolling that out with iOS 9
[59:20.020 --> 59:26.740]  But it's more of a long-term initiative. So it might not be ready yet. Hmm, and there's also a browse around me feature
[59:27.140 --> 59:35.100]  So let's say you're standing on a street and you want to see a curated list of great places to go around you
[59:35.100 --> 59:40.980]  So it's kind of like the app around me and I'll show you like a list of the best cafes the best
[59:41.980 --> 59:44.340]  Whatever around you best cell phone store
[59:45.100 --> 59:51.200]  And they've also been testing that with an augmented reality view so you can wave your phone around and see
[59:51.820 --> 59:57.060]  Through the phone's camera lens the stuff around you kind of like Yelp tested a feature like this a few years ago
[59:57.060 --> 59:59.060]  And Google had something like this
[59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.140]  Not sure if that's ready, but those are some things they've been testing. Hmm. Very interesting
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.940]  I do think with some of the mapping stuff
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.500]  It's understandable that they're still behind
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:16.100]  Google just because Google had a lead and I write I do think that they've sort of
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.640]  That they're roughly keeping pace. Like I don't think they're I
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:25.980]  My gut feeling is that they're closer than they were. I mean when when Apple Maps debuted it infamously
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.980]  It was you know, one of the worst
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.660]  Received product rollouts in recent memory from Apple
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.660]  I
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:39.300]  Think since then even if you don't count that first version even if you fast forward a year
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:44.220]  I still think that in the time since then they've caught up more to Google than Google has
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.800]  Pulled further ahead and I think that's just the way it is when you're behind. That's fair. Yeah
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:55.660]  But here's my problem with that. My problem is that only now they're starting their own data collection to release
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.180]  more reliable version
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:05.420]  3-4 years from now instead of going to TomTom and those other data sources back whenever they started this project in 2010
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:13.560]  2011 before the fall 2012 launch instead of going to them. Why didn't Apple start their own data collection, you know process at the very beginning
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.420]  That's what I don't get
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.460]  Yeah, and I would broaden it a little bit and just say that and again, I do think that they've gotten better
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.580]  I use Apple Maps and I know with Topolsky on his show
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.460]  He's he was like laughed at me and said nobody uses Apple Maps
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.260]  But that's not true. If you look at the stats like iPhone users overwhelmingly use Apple Maps
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.100]  It's yeah, you know they use it
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.980]  They use it way more than Google Maps and I've had some really good experiences with it
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.460]  But the thing that gets me is it seems like some of the stuff that they've done
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.180]  It could be expressed is that they've cheaped out
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.860]  Like why not just like you you know
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:51.660]  Like you said why not start collecting the money like some of this is just sort of a manpower issue like Google
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:58.180]  Street View is a pretty cool feature but among many things that Google does it to me is like
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.100]  It's not the most technically impressive to me
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:07.380]  It's like manpower impressive that they've sent so many cars out with so many teams
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.620]  To take so many pictures
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.740]  All around the world. It's just like
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.300]  It's like how many companies have the resources to do that?
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.320]  Well, guess what Apple is a company that has you know
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.220]  It's it to me seems like a problem that you can solve by throwing money at it. Absolutely
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:25.540]  And who has more money than Apple? They should have started throwing money at this. Oh
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.540]  a bit longer ago and the
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.580]  And again, I whenever this comes up on the show
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.780]  I always preface it by saying it is so much easier to spend somebody else's money than your own
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.180]  So every time I advocate Apple spending money. Yes, I understand
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:47.540]  And that the way that you build a massive war chest of money like they have is by not spending money frivolously
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:55.700]  But yeah, that's it. Why not buy every map being company with decent, you know
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:03:00.020]  Why not buy as many of them as they can or at least more than they have why not buy Tom Tom?
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.540]  Whatever it costs because surely whatever it would cost would be affordable to Apple
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.660]  Right. I mean, I know they looked at more than they that they bought they looked at Foursquare for sure
[01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.580]  Yeah, they looked at they looked at Yelp or a deeper partnership with Yelp
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.420]  But I guess they felt they could do it better than their own better on their own
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.220]  And what's the point of buying Tom Tom if you can have a cheaper partnership with them anyways, I?
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.940]  Guess but on the other I don't know it just in the back of my head. It just seems to me like that they
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.400]  Yes, there's engineering problems
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.260]  but that some of the stuff with maps could have been accelerated by throwing money at it and
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.220]  Again, one thing is just putting manpower out there, you know and having more
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.340]  You know more of these teams with these
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:52.260]  Goofy looking bands covered with cameras out in the street, right? What they seem to be doing with these acquisitions is buying
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.380]  maps related technology and
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:02.120]  Resource and science companies from that instead of buying a data company. So Tom Tom's data companies
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:08.680]  So is Foursquare and Yelp, but they bought all those transit apps who came up with like trip planning features and all that
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:14.580]  They bought spot setter, which didn't provide data, but it sort of aggregated points of interest
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.760]  But they'll be using for that other mass feature we talked about
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.080]  So they're sort of buying the means to build the data themselves
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.300]  right, and they bought the company that had the thing that they use for the
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.460]  3d view right c3 technologies, right and I think that at the time that they're they're live, you know
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:39.960]  It took Apple's acquisition of them for them to really beef up the amount of imaging that they had but it was so is it?
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.200]  Yes, they had some but it was mostly a technology acquisition not a data acquisition. Well, they bought c3
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.800]  Before the maps came out
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.240]  So they bought c3 in
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.880]  2011 when the maps was in 2012, but I guess it wouldn't have been as good without them, right?
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.620]  I don't remember during like the beta period for iOS 6
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:04.040]  they stripped all the 3d from one of the betas and then the next release all
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.840]  The 3d stuff came back and it was ten times better than it was before soon
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.340]  No, I don't remember that something probably fixed in the middle there
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.960]  I do remember that it was a major part of four stalls demo of it when he unveiled it
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.160]  Right at the iPhone 5 at that time
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.280]  WWDC right. Yeah, that was also his fault. So yeah
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:29.760]  Maybe a little bit. Well, you know, I might have been the straw that broke the camel's back is
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.680]  Yeah, one way to look at it. Sure
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.960]  I think that even if maps I suspect though my hunches in the alternate universe were maps had a
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.520]  Let's say lukewarm response because I think that was the best they were gonna do
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.080]  there was no way they were gonna it's just not feasible to come out of the gate with a with a
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.480]  A complete peer to Google Maps
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.760]  but they had to make the switch because of contract reasons that they just couldn't they
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.040]  Were they did not want to give Google another year and what Google was asking for them?
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.240]  You know was more than they wanted to give and they wanted things like turn-by-turn directions
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.680]  So they needed to just rip the band-aid off and do it
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.680]  Even if it had been a better launch like hey, this is about as good as we could have done the first time
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.580]  I still think forest all would have been gone when he was gone. Oh, yeah, I agree, but I think that you know
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.480]  It didn't help. I don't think it helped anybody. No
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:34.200]  What else in Mac, oh or not Mac OS iOS 9 iOS 9 so we talked about San Francisco
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.200]  transit
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.480]  Oh the proactive stuff. So last year's big term was continuity, right?
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.640]  Right this year the big charm now
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:52.040]  I don't know if this expands marketing wise but internally something called proactive and that maps browse around me features one component
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:56.800]  But another component now, I don't know if this is a hundred percent a lock for next week
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.680]  But they have been working on this with the intention back whenever they were working on this for iOS 9
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.000]  so I just want to preface by saying that but it's an entirely new spotlight and
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.880]  And instead of pulling down on the home screen you swipe to the right to open the new screen on the left
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.840]  Kind of like how you open spotlight pre iOS 7. Yeah, I when I read this on your site
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.360]  I misread it at first and I didn't get it and now I get it. It's sort of like to me
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.960]  It's like home screen 0 like if you count your first home screen is home screen 1 now
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.880]  There's one at position 0 to the left, right?
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:37.120]  And I called it a layer in my story and that probably was not a good way to reference it. Yeah
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.960]  Probably better would have been the first home screen
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.600]  But it's part of the OS and at the top there's like the spotlight search bar that you have now
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.260]  But beneath that is a bunch of timely functionality similar to Google now
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.120]  So your next calendar appointments if you have an appointment at the airport
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:04.000]  You're going on a flight the passbook card for the airline ticket could appear if I call you John every day at 5 30 p.m
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.160]  A bubble could pop up saying it's time to call John or if it's 1 p.m
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.400]  And it's lunchtime another bubble with local
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.880]  Restaurants around my location could pop up so stuff of that nature, right?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.840]  But that's where you'll go if you know that you want to launch this app and you don't know which home screen it's on instead
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.000]  Of doing the pull-down thing you go over there to home screen 0 and start typing the name of the app
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  Right. So yep
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.060]  That there's that too, but there also will be yeah, it's kind of like when you type in
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.480]  Like a search term now, it'll show you like Wikipedia or other stuff like that. Yeah, so if you were to type in
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:51.280]  You know like call or food or calendar whatever those relevant search results could pop up or they could just be there waiting for you
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:57.240]  It's to be seen what they do, but it's a big emphasis on redoing spotlight for more contextual features
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.180]  Yeah, I forget if we've talked about I think I was with Renee last week where we talked about this
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:04.480]  But the one reason that to me it makes a lot of sense is that
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.400]  Just from a basic. I
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:15.020]  Don't even know what you want to call it just a common sense user interface design thing the way it is now and the way
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.020]  It has been since iOS 7
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:22.420]  It doesn't make a lot of sense to me because if you pull down from the edge you get
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:29.420]  Notification Center in today view, but if you pull down in the middle, then you get the spotlight search and to me that
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.100]  pull down from two different places and you get two entirely different things is
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.980]  It's just a bad idea. Oh, yeah. Yeah for sure, right?
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.020]  So give it its own side and then all of a sudden to me it makes a lot more sense
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:47.080]  Right and with the new functionality, so I think that if this isn't does indeed launch next week
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:53.780]  It will be the highlight of iOS 9. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised and that would be a good place to where where
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.060]  Who knows if they have any new partnerships to announce, you know?
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:03.460]  From other third parties that you know that could sneak into those results, right?
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.380]  Have you seen the app queue that Apple acquired a couple years ago?
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.380]  Only I think through your report
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:16.980]  But yes, and it's spelled based on that like Eddie's last name. See you. That's why he bought it. He wanted the domain name
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.940]  Well, you have to clarify though that it's not QUE you eat right right, right
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.900]  See you II maybe they bought it for trademark purposes. So what well, what's the Q app?
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:36.500]  The Q app is basically a list of things in your day based on your calendar. So
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:43.020]  Basically what I explained kind of like Google now so you have a Facebook event coming up or a calendar event that you're going on
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:49.480]  A flight or you want to pull up the airline ticket or restaurants cafes and or offices or stores around you
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:57.100]  Type of deal also vocal events or let's say in my calendar. I have podcasts with John at
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:05.700]  At 1 30 p.m. Around 1 30 p.m. I'll get a bubble saying podcast with John. It'll show me your contact and phone number
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:14.000]  And maybe emails related to it as well. It's very contact app email and maps oriented. Yeah
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.020]  That sounds right to me and it's
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.620]  you know, let's face it a lot of this stuff is
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.300]  It's no surprise that
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:31.060]  That iOS and Android are sort of coalescing around the same ideas and right, you know
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.180]  I think in terms of UI niceness
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:38.900]  iOS was way out ahead and in terms of
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.820]  This sort of context about your life
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:52.280]  Sensibility Google was obviously ahead and is ahead and so they're both playing catch-up in each other's areas
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.860]  And so it's no surprise to me that and I you know, I didn't even make hay about it
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:03.380]  I pointed it out, but I you know to me it's no surprise that the new copy and paste UI in Android M is
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.580]  Really? It's just their version of the iOS copy and paste system
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:13.900]  They tried their own thing with these inscrutable icons at the top of the thing as opposed to putting it right above the selection
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:18.720]  I think maybe they were trying to do the noble thing and come up with their own UI and you know what?
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.660]  There's you know, the bottom line is lo these five six years since iOS had copy and paste later
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.980]  it's pretty clear this is the way to do it on a touchscreen and now they're doing it and I
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:36.300]  think that this sort of look your phone should know if you have a flight and ideally it should know if
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:42.860]  Traffic is bad between where you are right now and the airport where you're going like and all that stuff will be there
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:49.220]  Right, like this is not super advanced AI like you, you know, you're in centers
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.780]  You know me I'm in Center City, Philadelphia. I have a flight today at five
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.240]  That leaves from the Philadelphia Airport well
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.260]  It's not that hard for like the phone to figure out that at some point
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.020]  I'm gonna need to leave where I am and get to the airport and
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.940]  It can check the map and say wow traffic is really bad. You should leave earlier than you think
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.340]  And they've been building up to this for the last few years
[01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:19.100]  Anyways with some of that data that you can see the places you go to often and all that
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:25.300]  Well, I think this ties into another bit of news this week, which is Tim Cook's speech at this epic
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:31.180]  EPIC dinner where where you know, depending on you want to put it sort of a scathing critique of
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.820]  Without naming them
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:40.820]  I'd say Google and Facebook and the fact that they sell targeted ads based on what they know about you
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.820]  and
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:47.220]  You know, it's got a lot of coverage I think deservedly so I think it's definitely an interesting issue
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.500]  I think it's one that that you know
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.400]  Whatever even if you're all in on the Google platform that you want to be aware of
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.140]  I do think I think Ben Thompson had a good piece
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.060]  It's behind his paywall for subscribers
[01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.580]  But he had a good piece that I would summarize like this that if Tim Cook's being disingenuous
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.140]  it is in
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:13.580]  The way that he's phrasing it and I think it's a sort of very astute point from from Ben, which is
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.700]  that cook is saying that they're selling your information to advertisers and
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:28.540]  They're not actually what they're doing is promising advertisers that their ads will go to the people who are interested
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:31.300]  But they're not giving that information to the advertisers
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:35.680]  So an advertiser who pays for the targeted ad doesn't know a goddamn thing about Mark Kerman
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:41.760]  Right. It's it's because that information is what enables them to sell the ads
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.400]  They're actually right they they do collect information about you
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.880]  They do use that information to make money from advertising
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:54.400]  But they're not giving that information to advertisers because it's that that information that they have
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.840]  That is so valuable that if anything they might be more motivated to keep your stuff private than Apple is
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:07.120]  because it's the fact that nobody else knows as much about you as Facebook and or Google in the
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.200]  Different ways that they know stuff about you that makes them so valuable. It's actually an interesting point
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.280]  but on the flip side and where this ties in with what you and I have just been talking about is I think some people are
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.200]  overlooking the fact that because
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.560]  Apple doesn't collect this stuff for the purpose of selling you targeted ads that they're not even in the ballgame of
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.920]  The exact context sensitive stuff and I don't think that I think that they're there
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.240]  They're gonna be very very surprised by the next year or two from Apple. Yeah, this is a differentiator here
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.520]  I agree is that it's it's all about the data that Apple already has with from you on the phone
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.120]  And maybe this will be on the Mac, too
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:52.200]  They're not really opening this up to third-party developers as much as they could if they wanted to
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:59.120]  Not care about privacy as much as they do. I'll re retell an anecdote. I told the Topolsky on his show earlier this week
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:02.560]  because I think it's so telling and it's an early example of this sort of thing, but
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.840]  Back in April early April I had an appointment with my accountant and my I live in Center City, Philadelphia
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.400]  My accountant is out in the suburbs. I've been going to him for years
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.280]  I know how to get there, but I was testing the Apple watch. It was the first week
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.000]  it was actually the week in between when I got the review unit and when the review was due and
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  I don't drive that much
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:28.880]  That well, here's the one here's a chance to try out driving directions. I'll let the watch give me driving directions there
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.880]  Even though I don't really need them and it worked great
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:39.260]  But then like halfway there it told me to get off the we call it. It's the Schuylkill Expressway
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.920]  It's the main artery west out of Philadelphia
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.520]  And it told me to get off and go a way that I never would have driven
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.200]  I thought well, I'll listen. I'll listen to Siri
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.680]  let's see what happens and as I took the exit I looked ahead and I could see that it was all that I it had
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.680]  taken me off an exit and
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:04.660]  Traffic was at a standstill ahead and I was like hmm and it took me this weird way
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.200]  We through North Philadelphia that I never would have gone
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.120]  I've never driven there in my life and I ended up getting to my accountant maybe
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.960]  Ten minutes later than I normally would have given when I left but I was still early
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:24.480]  I was on time and I checked on on the news and on maps and a tractor-trailer had overturned on the Schuylkill Expressway
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.240]  And if I had just stayed on the Schuylkill
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.620]  I never would have made the appointment and it actually was kind of a big deal because
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.440]  like rescheduling an appointment with your accountant in early April is
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.200]  It's like you're asking a huge favor because yeah, not easy pretty much. He's already booked 14 hours a day
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.840]  I was kind of blown away
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:49.780]  It's very very clear to me that the dry turn-by-turn driving the directions I got from Siri took the traffic into
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.280]  consideration and gave me a bizarre to me a bizarre plan B or
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.580]  root B until I found out that there is this traffic and I think
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.640]  Little things like that are the sort of things that people I I think a lot of people think Apple
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.760]  Isn't doing at all and that that's why they you know, they think Google has a leg up in these regards, right?
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.540]  So you think they need a better pronounce that they're doing this?
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:15.140]  Yeah, and you know, I think it's gonna sneak up on it might you know
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:19.260]  It might be the sort of thing that they never get credit for because they might never completely catch up to Google
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:25.420]  But they're right, they'll keep pace and and these things are gonna get better, but there's no doubt that this is the future
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.420]  this is like the next few years of
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:33.160]  Like the whole ballgame, right? So maybe like this new spotlight screen will show
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:39.760]  Maybe leave a few minutes early because there's a car fire here and there. Yeah or something like that, you know
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.600]  Yeah, and I wonder how that ties into Siri to like this new spotlights. Yeah
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.380]  Siri it's a compliment. It's not a replacement or
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.620]  Really anything like that. It's more of a works with Siri type of thing, right?
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:19:00.140]  So it's I wouldn't call it a textual view of Siri and more so call it a compliment
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.140]  I think is a good way to do it
[01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.700]  But some of it's already tied in like when you do, you know
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.380]  Like and it's some of its just product marketing. What do they call?
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:14.180]  What what do they call Siri exactly see like I honestly when I was writing this report
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:19.900]  I didn't have insight into how they're gonna market it because I don't even know if they settled on all that by the time
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:21.660]  This story was written
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:27.940]  But they could very well kill the name spotlight not username proactive and call all this stuff Siri
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.500]  Like the new Siri screen on the home screen. Yeah, or they could just keep this as I mean
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.220]  I think they're just gonna keep this as spotlight as this whole thing called spotlight. All right
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:40.100]  So what if they even integrate this onto the Mac, too?
[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.540]  I mean some of the stuff wouldn't make sense, but maybe a better view for appointments and such
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:50.020]  Yeah, because some of the stuff definitely involves some of the same partners, you know where?
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:57.380]  The the autofill results in Safari come from some of the same partners that they have for Siri
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.760]  That's yeah, and that's the same deal
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:05.120]  it's all it's all one back end type of deal here the spotlight the new proactive stuff and the
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:11.020]  Results in Safari and a lot of this is really to try to tackle Google and reduce reliance on them
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:17.860]  Eventually, you know, it's very hard to just wake up one day and decide to drop Google search from your platform
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:22.620]  But year over year they're adding features that kind of reduce the reliance on Google
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:26.020]  Kind of teaching the consumer that Google is not necessary
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:33.940]  So last year they took some steps with the new spotlight with the Wikipedia results and all that and some news articles this year
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:38.240]  They'll have this next year. Maybe they'll have something else. Maybe a year two or three after that
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:44.220]  Everyone will be like there's no point for Google search and it would be easy to go away. I've noticed and it's subtle
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:52.420]  And I use duck duck go a lot too, but on I don't even know why I don't really have a strategy for it
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.220]  But like on my Mac
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:59.380]  I have my default search for the search field in Safari said to duck duck go and I have had it set for months and
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:04.260]  I've tried it on and off ever since they made it an option and at some point
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.260]  It was it got to be good enough where it's stuck
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.060]  On the phone. I still have Google as my default search
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:16.000]  I I don't know why but I've noticed that even on the phone how many times the top result is
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:23.900]  Yes, that's what I'm looking for. And then I noticed that it's not going through Google. It's the Safari suggestion
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:30.040]  Which is backed by Google that they're more or less. It's like their version of I feel lucky
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:36.300]  Right, except you get to pre absolutely you get to preview it before you actually tap it and I I've noticed on the phone
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.740]  That it's it's exactly what I want an awful lot of time
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.660]  Which right and there's a big emphasis right and there's also a big emphasis part of this proactive thing
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.240]  to improve that because right now it's not
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:54.160]  a hundred percent of the time that you'll get a Wikipedia result or a news article the news article thing for a search term might
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.400]  only fire
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:01.160]  25% of the time so they're working on improving the AI so you can you can get more quick results
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.800]  Like you said more frequently
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:09.360]  Let me take a break here and thank our third sponsor and it is our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.840]  It's the all-in-one
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.420]  hosting website building platform
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:20.300]  You need a website you go to Squarespace and they got it all everything. You can register your domain name you have
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:26.820]  The hosting is taken care of they have all sorts of templates you choose from visually through drag-and-drop
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.900]  You want to get in there? You want to mess with the code?
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:35.220]  You can mess with the code you can do it all but it's all there and the framework is there and it's the difference between
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:42.300]  Starting like if you're building an app starting with a framework like cocoa or cocoa code
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:45.860]  or cocoa touch or just starting with like a
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:52.100]  Blank text file and building an app from scratch. That's the difference. That's what Squarespace is like
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:56.020]  It's like a framework for websites and you can use it to build
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:02.700]  Almost any sort of website you can imagine you want to build a store. They've got it. They've got templates for that
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.700]  they've got all of the
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:11.620]  Commerce stuff built right into the platform. You don't have to pay extra to get an e-commerce enabled account
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.500]  That's just built in to a regular Squarespace account
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.660]  So if you have stuff to sell you can sell it you want to set up a podcast?
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:24.600]  They've got that you can set up a podcast right there in Squarespace. They've even got podcast specific stuff like the audio player
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:33.300]  Analytics and stuff like that their analytics for any kind of website are absolutely drop-dead gorgeous
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:38.980]  I just linked to a guy this week who after I linked to his blog which would have I didn't even know it happened to
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.700]  Be hosted at Squarespace
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.700]  and his you know, he was
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:44.380]  It's this sound self-serving
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.780]  But he went from serving lane a couple hundred hits a month to serving a couple thousand in a day because I linked to him
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:53.460]  From daring fireball. Well a his Squarespace blog held up perfectly
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:56.800]  He didn't even notice it took like a friend to text him that I had mentioned it
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.820]  Your site doesn't go down if you suddenly get a lot of traffic
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:07.540]  But then he posted these screenshots of his analytics and they're gorgeous just drop-dead gorgeous analytics
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.540]  Just looks like something from Edward tough
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.540]  Really really great
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:17.960]  Everything you need all there in one platform if you don't have any kind of coding
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.140]  Skill, that's okay
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:28.020]  You can go from signing up to having your completely launched and perfect looking website all in one if you do have coding skill
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.940]  There's all sorts of places where you can get in there and customize it to your heart's content
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:37.020]  Here's the thing. I just don't even get this doesn't make any sense to me all of this
[01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:43.220]  It starts at just eight bucks a month. And if you sign up for a year in advance you get a free domain name. I
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.860]  Don't know. I don't know how they provide all this. They've got great support 24 hours a day seven days a week
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:52.300]  365 days a year you just get on there and you can open up a chat
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.140]  with
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:01.180]  Customer support agents the way they do it to get it 24-7 is they have some some in New York some over in Ireland and some
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.580]  Out in Portland, I think so that it spreads it all around the world different time zones
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:11.460]  If you have a website that you want to make if you have a website you already have that you're not happy with the way
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.860]  It's hosted. Give them a try you get a free trial. No credit card required
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:21.180]  Just go to squarespace.com and when you sign up to pay here's the new code Gruber
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:28.860]  My last name GRUBER and you get 10% off use that code my last name Gruber and you'll save 10% off
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.860]  So go there sign up for your free account
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:36.060]  Free trial and go try Squarespace. I can't recommend them. I highly enough
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.580]  So iOS 9 we were talking about proactive that doesn't sound like a name that they would use
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:47.340]  No, especially with the acne cream with the same name. Maybe it's just an internal thing
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:53.820]  Yeah, you never know though. It's very hard to predict the product marketing stuff and it tends to be the tightest kept secret
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.100]  Partly because they can just change it at the last minute
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:04.460]  Right, right. All right. What else is on the agenda for iOS 9 iOS 9 some minor things are on the edges
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.700]  so
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:11.660]  They've been testing a new feature for iMessage where you can set read receipts per contact
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.980]  So if I want messages sent to you
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:18.860]  For you to know that if you if they've been read, that's fine
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.900]  But if I don't want my parents to see that I've read their messages
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:26.220]  Can turn that off right? I that makes a lot of sense
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.420]  That also makes me think that they're using it a lot internally
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.340]  Yeah, perhaps also. Oh, this is maybe to your point about internal usage. They're also testing
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.380]  Read receipts for group chats so you can see
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.980]  Who in a chat has read each message?
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.180]  Yeah, that makes sense too. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah same probably the same infrastructure
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.660]  Deal there. Yeah, um force touch support
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:57.340]  Obviously, they won't announce that on monday, but right means that the 6s will have force touch
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.180]  I'm sure there'll be a developer api for that as well
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:07.740]  Yeah, but I wonder and I wonder if that's the sort of thing that will i'm guessing no
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.100]  But it's you know, obviously they're not going to talk about it
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:16.540]  But will it be in the beta builds? Will it will be people be able to look at it? My guess is no
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:20.060]  I think they're i'm sure someone will find it hidden right deep down
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:27.500]  Trying to think oh on the the homekit app so a new app at least we were planning this
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:32.300]  Now that they have homekit accessories in the market, which just happened to come out this past week
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.540]  You'll be able to set up install
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:43.820]  Organize through virtual rooms your homekit setups. So that's an interesting app. They have home and then homekit health health kit and
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.540]  All that
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:50.300]  I wonder how much homekit stuff they're going to have to announce next week
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:56.540]  Because that's another one where where the word that i'd understood was that it was
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.900]  Sort of like a
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:06.620]  That the apple tv would be the hub for that sort of thing, you know, right right. Yeah, I did hear that as well
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500]  and if they don't have
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:15.900]  The apple tv. I don't know what that means for homekit even though they're already out, you know publicly with that
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.900]  The first homekit products are you know?
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.540]  Shipping imminently and stuff like that
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.660]  It'll be interesting to see uh also on the ipad
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:29.420]  It sounds like split screen apps are finally ready
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:37.260]  Yeah, I saw that and i'm curious that that's not like a thing that they held for new hardware and that they might announce it next week
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:44.140]  Oh, they they may be holding it for new hardware. Ah, but but you but you're saying it's definitely in that it's in the os
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:49.740]  Right, so they might not announce it. It might not be in the betas, but they're working on it with the os
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:56.140]  another thing is uh multi-users on the ipad
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.020]  That for sure isn't ready
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:03.020]  For 9.0, but they are working on that too. So maybe do you know?
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:11.660]  Is it true multi-user support like like if if let's say somebody and their spouse both share an ipad and that they could
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.540]  You know person a can
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.180]  Use it and then when they put it down
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:24.140]  Their spouse can pick it up and switch and then it'll like, you know, do something and then it's completely the other person's ipad
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:27.500]  Or is it just like a guest account? No, no, no
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:34.780]  No, it's true multi-user on a mac with different home directories and all that. Of course the user can't see home directories in ios
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:41.100]  But in terms of the infrastructure and the fundamentals of it, it's just like on the mac from what I understand
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.740]  Hmm
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:48.540]  All right. Let's see if I still got a little game left. All right, what about this? Have you heard anything?
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.260]  about in ios
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.060]  Getting a dedicated iCloud drive app
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:59.020]  Um, yes that there was a dedicated iCloud drive app
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:06.140]  But i'm not sure if that's internal only or if it's going to be released, uh, the last person I talked to
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:10.620]  Said they didn't see an iCloud drive app on the ios 9 build they were using
[01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:14.300]  So maybe it's an app store download you activated in settings
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:19.820]  But for sure they have one in usage internally and able to be used and ready to go
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:25.020]  In fact, i'm surprised they didn't have an iCloud drive app released with iCloud drive last year
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.380]  But I wouldn't be surprised by an iCloud drive app at all
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.180]  Right, which should probably be the closest that ios is ever going to get to having a finder
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.540]  Yeah, I think so right instead of a of access to the file system
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:43.420]  It's you get the access to this abstract file system, which isn't really the file system
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.060]  It's you know, like dropbox
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.620]  right sort of or like in um
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:55.020]  In the finder if you were just limited to the iCloud drive source list item, right?
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:58.380]  It'll be interesting to see I mean even thinking about myself right now
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:05.020]  I use dropbox if they had a full-fledged ios app. I absolutely consider switching to iCloud drive
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:08.220]  Yeah, because why why duplicate it right now?
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:13.260]  Let me tell you why I think that you could be right on this iCloud drive app if you were implying that you had heard this
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:19.260]  They are kind of going to be pushing iCloud drive more as a service
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:27.740]  As in right now the notes app in the calendar app and all that it uses an IMAP infrastructure through iCloud
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.220]  For syncing what your device is
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:38.220]  But what they're wanting to do is remove that and turn notes and calendared reminders into what they're calling iCloud drive apps
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.860]  So when you launch notes on ios 9 or os 10 10.11
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:49.100]  It'll say would you like to transition your data over to iCloud drive now iCloud drive?
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:54.300]  Obviously, they have more control over it. It's more secure it goes back to the privacy and security stuff we talked about
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:57.260]  And also it's probably quicker than IMAP syncing
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:01.740]  So I think it's got to be if it's not quicker than IMAP then they've got a real problem, right?
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:08.140]  IMAP is not a quick syncing right protocol, right? So there could be a big iCloud drive portion then there
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:16.060]  Yeah, and it's interesting and it's this the it's always hard to migrate right because I can see why and I can see why
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:19.900]  That when you launch it they ask because it's a big deal, right?
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.700]  but the thing is now and notes is the one near and dear to my heart as you know, the
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.140]  Part of the developers behind Vesper. I know just how bad
[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:32.620]  IMAP is as a note syncing protocol and and they've done
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:39.180]  what I think is the noble thing and allowed you for years to pick any of your IMAP accounts to be
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.180]  One of you know, it's an option with every IMAP account you set up
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:47.740]  Do you want notes to use this too? Right and then they set up a secret mailbox called notes?
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:53.180]  And it's actually a mailbox on your mail account that apple mail is a secret mailbox
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.060]  That apple mail is smart enough not to show you
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:00.220]  But the notes are all IMAP messages and it's behind the scenes
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:06.620]  It's really a mess because IMAP was never meant to do that messages aren't meant to be read-write some email systems get screwed up
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.220]  and
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:13.020]  As anybody who's ever had anything to do with email development or apis knows?
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:21.260]  IMAP server a and IMAP server b never speak quite the same dialect of IMAP. So notes is trying to you know
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:28.220]  Like a like a babble fish type thing and treat all these IMAP things as equivalent back ends when they're not
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:32.140]  Right, so I guess this serves to fix all that and it could be a bigger deal than
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:38.780]  Yeah, it should it if you switch I would switch immediately. Yeah, you know and it should make
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:45.100]  Anything that you switch that way. What else is it besides notes? Would it I heard notes is the big one that
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.540]  That that's the one that they really focused on
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.860]  but assuming that
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.140]  You know, they're wanting to get this across the board as a service
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.140]  notes
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.580]  Reminders contacts and calendars would all be part of it
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:03.180]  What does reminders use now is reminders. I'm not based
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:09.580]  I think it is i'm not 100 sure. I don't know or or even if it's not it's probably not using iCloud drive
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.940]  Which is right
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:16.220]  It's it's like a directional shift to positioning iCloud drive as the service for storage
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:21.180]  All this data now maybe some more developer enhancements to that as well. Yeah, the other
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:29.580]  benefit to this is it's always good when apple is dog food in its own iCloud stuff because
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:32.620]  It's it means that any kind of
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:38.460]  Bugs or even if it's not a bug even if it's like well when you do this, it's actually kind of slow
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:43.340]  Makes it way more likely that it's going to get a higher priority to be addressed because
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:48.940]  Quite frankly apple cares more about their own stuff and then they do everybody else's right another big thing
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:53.020]  I don't know if this interests most consumers, but big changes to swift
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:59.980]  So, you know right now this is not very well known everyone hears the term swift swift is apple's new thing
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:07.260]  But as you probably know ios is not written in swift the apples native apps. They're not they're not swift apps
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:11.420]  They're still on the objective c because swift is still in its early stages
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:17.740]  But I believe that on monday, they're going to announce that swift is moving into stage two that it's
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.820]  meeting a new level of stability where apple is actually going to
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:25.820]  Pre-install the swift programming libraries into ios 9
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:32.160]  So developers could write swift apps and not have to include the swift libraries in each of their binaries
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:38.860]  Which means that the os will make app downloads for new ios 9 apps about 10 megabytes
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:43.420]  Smaller or eight megabytes smaller on average and let's say you have 10
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:51.900]  You know swift apps on your ios 8 phone. That's about 80 megabytes back, which is great for people on smaller storage sizes
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.400]  And then next year with ios 10 and 10.12
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:01.820]  They're hoping to hit like 3.0 and ship their own apps written in swift
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:07.820]  So that's going to be a major transition next year if they stick to that pace if they're not going to be able to
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:11.020]  That pace if they hit that that's actually you know
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:17.900]  For anybody who's not a programmer and doesn't understand just how deep apple's roots with objective c goes if they started shipping
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.820]  apple first party apps written in swift in
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.680]  2016 that's
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.380]  startlingly fast
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.380]  Really really really would be
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:34.460]  I think even last year everybody was blown away by the announcement of swift in the kino even then though. I think most people's
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.580]  Best case scenario was three or four years out. Yeah, I guess the plan could change but yeah
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:44.700]  No, i've heard the same thing about the libraries being built into the os
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:51.420]  And I think that there's two explanations for that and I could be I think i'm right on both parts
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:58.700]  But I think one of them is that swift was developed in secret and very few people knew about it before the keynote last year
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:02.300]  inside apple and so therefore there was no way that the
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:08.620]  That no matter how stable it was when it debuted there's no way that it was going to make it into ios 8 right?
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:12.540]  And number two, it wasn't that stable. It's a fast-moving target
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:18.380]  They said so, you know it that they did not over promise, you know, they said hey some of this stuff is going to change
[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:24.460]  You know, we're showing it to you now because we want it to change based on the feedback we get from you guys outside
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:27.740]  And so because it was changing so fast
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:32.380]  I don't know that it was even feasible to include the the libraries in the os because
[01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:37.900]  If your app was compiled against an earlier version of swift
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:45.020]  From around september and mine was compiled with a newer version of swift like the version 1.2
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:49.180]  I think which came out in february. We need different libraries anyway
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:54.620]  And so yeah, you're exactly right though that every single swift app written to date includes the swift
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.220]  Libraries, you know in the app bundle, right?
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:05.260]  It definitely adds up over wireless. I mean when you're on cellular, right? Yeah, that's another big thing there. So
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:12.380]  Um part of the same quality stability overall low-level improvements type of thing as well
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.260]  Yeah, I definitely think so. Yeah, I
[01:38:15.980 --> 01:38:20.460]  I don't know. You never know. I mean who knows what the hell's going to be in the keynote and anything that I mean
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:26.860]  All I know is ios 9 and os 10, but I wouldn't be surprised if swift made the keynote again and did not
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:32.140]  Wasn't just relegated to the afternoon state of the platform's second keynote, right? We'll see
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:39.260]  Maybe they'll throw something up on the that last slide. They always do with the the very small changes smaller app downloads or something
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:44.700]  For swift apps. Yeah, maybe that's that's certainly one way to make it compelling
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:48.700]  Uh, who knows, you know, and you know, the swift team was very secretive last year
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.660]  And even though you know the the public changes there have been plenty of them in the year since it's come out who knows what?
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:58.220]  Other secret stuff they've been working on in terms of performance or something like that
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.180]  I mean again, and it's so hard to say because I know the conference is wwdc and so
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:10.700]  Ostensibly the whole conference is about developers, but let's face it that the monday keynote is really a mass market apple keynote
[01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:14.940]  Yeah, I mean they're streaming it on their website the whole apple music thing this again
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.020]  Purely completely pulled out of my ass just but it's just in terms of knowing
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:24.540]  What some of the weak spots in swift currently are I know that debugging is a real weak spot
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:30.860]  It's it's not it's nothing that has nothing like the apparatus that objective c has for debugging. So if they added
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.860]  awesome
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:37.020]  Amazing, you know leaps ahead of objective c develop uh debugging
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:43.020]  Again, this might make like the general press who are there watching the keynote be like, I don't know
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.620]  What that means but it's going to make the developers in the audience go nuts
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:53.740]  They did a pretty good job with that last year of trying to spin the developer oriented announcements through a consumer focus
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.740]  So like when they had the whole developer
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:00.860]  Portion of the keynote they really focused on high level stuff such as like the touch id api
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.900]  Media could understand that yeah, but
[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:09.180]  And like the cool graphics they showed with the swift demo. So what else with ios 9 new keyboard
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.340]  Better legacy device support
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:19.580]  What do you know what have you heard about that now that's something that I guess you've reported on that they're targeting a5
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.220]  Right. Okay. So
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.660]  When they traditionally created a new ios update they would
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.340]  Like test all the features and all the devices they wanted to support
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.540]  And then pick apart features that didn't work well on the older hardware and that's kind of why
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:43.500]  Older iphones got bloated and stale and sluggish this year. They're targeting at least the iphone 4s and ipad mini specifically
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:50.620]  To instead of throwing all the features on those from ios 9 and then picking it apart they're adding features
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.260]  One by one on top of the os
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.020]  So on those older devices it should still be
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:01.980]  Much faster than even ios 8 so i would go as far as to say is ios 9
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.020]  so i would go as far as to say is ios 9 will make
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:09.580]  ipad minis and iphone 4s on older os's even faster
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:11.340]  so
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.460]  that
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.140]  sounds like
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:15.660]  common sense
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:21.820]  Like it just sounds like well duh, but I there's no doubt if that's true. That is a
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:27.020]  Seriously different strategy that they've pursued and in my opinion
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:32.160]  Extremely welcome. I mean for me personally, it's irrelevant because i'm an idiot and I buy a new iphone every year
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.000]  but
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.120]  As an observer of the company and as somebody who you know
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.480]  I always try to stay out of it like when family members like should I get a new iphone or what computer server?
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.640]  And I try to be like ask somebody else
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.480]  Because I feel like it's like you break it you bought it like you tell them to buy a macbook air and then you're on
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:54.080]  The hook for all the tech support going forward exactly, but I hear it. You know what I mean?
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.320]  It's like I I don't know. I don't know. What do you say to somebody who's like
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.880]  uh, you know like
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.680]  Somebody in your family who's like, I don't know my iphone said I had an update and I said, okay
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.800]  And then 10 minutes later and now my iphone is slow and it's like well that that sucks
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.640]  They're gonna need to spend some time changing the narrative on that because even the people who don't follow apple closely
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.520]  There is this narrative going around in like the mass market that iphone updates screw with your phone people don't want to update
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.520]  And so I think with this
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:31.600]  WWDC they're gonna have to step back and really promote the new s as being a big quality and performance leap
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  And I think that's exactly what they're gonna do
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:40.800]  Yeah, and I think that that's one of those things where apple gets and and it's this the the recent, you know
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.560]  thawing
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:46.000]  In in the post katie cotton pr apple
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.280]  You know and and the the sort of you know
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:56.560]  Maybe you wouldn't call them open, but they're opener sure and they were right that they're sort of trying to get past that which is that
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:04.160]  In the past it was very easy to mistake their complete and utter silence for
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:12.000]  Ambivalence whereas they might care very deeply about something but they're still not going to say anything and you can't how can you tell from the outside?
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.720]  And I think that that's one this might be one of those things where they've been
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.480]  They're aware of the criticism. They're aware of the problem not just the criticism
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.720]  But they're aware that it's a legitimate problem and and now they're doing something about it, right and they were of course aware of this before
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.840]  You know, it was written about like I know you were one of the first people to really highlight the the bugs
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:35.920]  Right earlier this year in ios 8, you know, 70 talking about that
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.720]  but you know, of course
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.400]  Engineers have been pushing for a step back like this for for a while, but you know, apple is really governed by marketing
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.240]  right, so
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.200]  yeah, well and perception, you know, right perception and so
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:44:01.120]  While we're on that subject what about this whole crazy discovery d thing, yeah heard anything about that. Uh,
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.480]  Yes, I did hear something about that
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.400]  The backstory but I don't remember what I was told
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.840]  Something about it being a mistake
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.160]  Something about it being a mistake
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.560]  that that wasn't the plan initially, I don't know I have to go back and look but
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.400]  I know that they knew this was a problem. They wanted to fix it
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.640]  What have you heard while I try to think about this?
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.240]  well
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:32.080]  I the rehashing a little bit from last week's show with renee, but it's what i've heard is that
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:39.120]  It's become a whipping boy internally and as it is a it is a bad piece of software at the moment now
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.880]  That doesn't mean it's unfixable. It just means it shouldn't have shipped when it did
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.200]  It should not have replaced mdns responder yet
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.880]  And the assumption that so many people had on the outside was that okay
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.080]  This clearly this piece of software discovery d is buggy
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:01.280]  But they must have shipped it because these continuity features must have depended on it and they had to you know
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.280]  These continuity features were a tent pole
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.880]  So they had to ship discovery d when they did ready or not. And then it turns out that that these you know
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:16.320]  The third-party people that sort of hacker crowd who figured out hey if you put in mdns responder from mac os
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.160]  10.8
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.360]  or
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.360]  10.9
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:22.800]  And
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:29.360]  Disable discovery d everything still works and the bugs from discovery d go away and your printer doesn't disappear after a week
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.360]  And your apple tv doesn't get renamed apple tv3 and again, like I said to renee
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.520]  I would never recommend that that i'm too old for that
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.920]  That's the sort of you know following advice like that is the sort of stuff that's a young man's game in my opinion
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.960]  but
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:44.560]  It turns out with the the the latest, you know
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.600]  That's exactly what apple has done now for you know in a more official format and with more rigorous
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.120]  You know qa and stuff like that
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  But more or less they've just taken out and which raises the question of how to if it wasn't needed for those continuity features
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:01.280]  How how did discovery d get through in the first place? So yeah, I just remembered
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.920]  similar to what you said
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:12.400]  What I heard was that the guy in charge of the mdns responder left apple or retired or was moved off the project
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.200]  And then the airport hardware team and the airport utility software team
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:24.320]  Somehow inherited that whole infrastructure and they made the change because they weren't under great direction
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:30.880]  And then when stuff hit the fan about that earlier this year, then they realized they had to change it back with the software
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:36.400]  Right, and I again, I don't know anything about the internals of mdns responder and discovery d
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:43.120]  But I can imagine though that maybe mdns maybe there's like a theory that mdns responder is old code. It's been there forever
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.080]  Maybe I don't know who knows maybe it even dates back to the next era
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.720]  And it's built up over time and is therefore sort of an ugly ugly, but it works type thing
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:57.760]  And that discovery d was hey, let's start all over and make something beautiful and modern
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320]  and elegant
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:05.360]  And you know a lot of times those things that sound like a good idea that involve. Let's start over
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:12.960]  Are not and turn up not being good ideas. That's my guess as to what happened is that somebody looked at mdns responders code?
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.640]  And thought this is a mess. It's too big. It's convoluted
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:22.960]  We can replace this with something smaller and more elegant and if it had worked it would have been a great idea and it's the problem
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.960]  Is that it didn't?
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.800]  But I have heard though that internally though that it became a whipping boy and took on
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:38.560]  Internally was deemed as being largely responsible for this whole. Hey yosemite is an unstable release of the os
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:44.160]  And that instead internally it was chalked up to it's not yosemite's problem
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:50.480]  It's discovery d's problem and that politically, you know, you don't really want to be the guy in charge of discovery d right now
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:59.600]  Yeah, we'll see if they come out on stage and it's it's funny because we're not him right exactly
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.800]  We wouldn't be laughing. Yeah
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.000]  All right. Let me take one last break. I have one more sponsor to thank and it is our good friends
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.440]  Really good friends of the show at igloo. You guys know igloo that's the name of the show
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.040]  Igloo, they make the intranet that you will actually like
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.520]  You sign up for igloo you get an intranet private intranet for your team and you can do things like share news
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.380]  organize your files share files coordinate calendars
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:32.880]  Manage projects and to-dos that sort of thing all in one place
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:37.600]  You can set up little micro blogs so you can have like your like the equivalent of twitter
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:43.680]  But just for your internal team we're a great little place where you can have a little chronological thing just like tweets
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.000]  Where you share links little comments stuff like that
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:52.800]  Their latest upgrade they call it viking revolves around documents and how you interact with them
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:59.680]  They really beefed up the ability to share documents, uh gather feedback make changes. They've even added the ability
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:06.000]  Uh, speaking of read receipts for iMessage igloo has read receipts now for documents that you've shared
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.280]  So if there's a document that certain people on your team absolutely have to see or have to sign off on
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.880]  They've got the ability now you can market where you'll receive a read receipt from the critical people on the team who have to see it
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.200]  It's just like read receipts for email or iMessage or something like that not annoying because it's your own private team
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:26.720]  You're not getting them from everybody external. It's just a little thing for your team
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:32.560]  If your company if your company or team has a legacy intranet something that you're using
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:36.960]  That looks like it was built in the 90s. And if you have an internet it almost certainly was
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:44.000]  Something like SharePoint or something like that that probably was built in the 90s. You should give igloo a try
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.660]  Uh, here's what you do go to their software go to their website igloosoftware.com
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:55.680]  Slash the talk show igloosoftware.com slash the talk show
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.240]  Uh, you'll get a free trial
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.840]  And if your team is ten people are under you can just use it for free indefinitely. Just use it for free
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.840]  That's it. And then if you have more than ten people
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:14.160]  Their prices are amazingly low per person over ten. So go to igloosoftware.com if you have a team you need to coordinate
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.040]  All the stuff that teams need to do
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:20.140]  Go there check them out my thanks to them great friends of the show
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.920]  Lots and lots of readers have signed up for this and have written to say just how much they love igloo
[01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.920]  So that my thanks to igloo
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:32.520]  All right, what else we got before we sign off for the for the episode new keyboard
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.520]  But I don't know much about that. What do you what have you heard? I don't know anything about it. Nothing. Nada
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.960]  Probably not a big change. Yeah, hopefully just a fixed shift key. That's their fixed shift key. Yeah
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.080]  yeah, it's it's funny but
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:51.480]  Like the the dns guy or discovery d guy. It's not funny for them
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:58.440]  But they did fix it a little bit I find that the whatever they did that when they made it go white
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.240]  I guess they fixed it and they broke it. They fixed it again
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:05.320]  Yeah, I still don't know why they don't just make it blue. Yeah
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.480]  Like the blue to me
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:13.080]  Like I just don't get that because the to me when when the arrow went blue when shift was engaged
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:15.480]  It was so unambiguous
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.040]  That it nobody I never even had to think about it
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.680]  It's like I never even in the early years of ios it never even occurred to me that there was something to think about
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:27.160]  There right exactly like and to me that's the hallmark of all good design is all good design
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:30.540]  It took tons of good thinking and tons of work and prototypes
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:38.040]  To result in a thing that when you use it looks like it wasn't designed at all. Yeah, whereas the ios 7 shift key
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.200]  Screamed I was designed by somebody
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.640]  Exactly
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:51.480]  Who thought they were very clever. Um, no, I haven't heard anything about new keyboard. I haven't heard that much
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:54.200]  Honestly, I I don't really I don't really know much
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.760]  I know everything I know comes from you mark. Well, i'm happy to hear that. I hope i'm all right
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.800]  I think you're pretty good. We should talk though before we go. Let's talk
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:06.300]  To wrap the show unless you have something else for wwdc
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.280]  Um, I mean we didn't really talk about the apple music stuff, but that's uh pretty straightforward, I guess
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.400]  yeah, and that stuff leaks like a sieve because the
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:22.680]  The media companies in general are blabbermouths like the tv companies, but the music companies are the worst the music companies
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.320]  It's like you can practically
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:28.920]  It's like eddie q isn't even out the door and they're calling
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:34.120]  People in the media to talk about the meeting that they just had. Yeah. Yeah, or he's at a warrior's game
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.120]  And they're sitting right next to him
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:42.040]  I still I still I cannot wait to see if he's at the game sunday night. Yeah
[01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:52.520]  If you don't have anything else though, I would just you know, just briefly let's go back a couple months and talk about the the
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:57.960]  Big feature profile you wrote I guess it was last year on apple pr. Okay
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.920]  um
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.920]  Which was I thought
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:08.520]  You know and there was I have to admit when you wrote it there, you know behind the scenes, you know that in my world
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.040]  There it definitely raised a lot of discussion and the consensus my it was that you were
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920]  half right
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:24.520]  And and a lot of it in ways that nobody had ever written about before which is mainly because apple pr doesn't want you
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:29.000]  writing about the way apple pr works and there is a little bit of
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.960]  You got to play ball and you don't
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:33.480]  You know
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.720]  Almost every interaction that I have with apple pr is off the record not for attribution. Whatever you want to call it, right?
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.340]  And so therefore writing about those machinations would there be therefore be a violation?
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.440]  Of what i've agreed to and therefore I don't write about it, right? I'm not hiding it
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.760]  It's you know, it is what it is and if you know
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.320]  And if I felt otherwise then I wouldn't agree to it in the first place
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:59.720]  And a lot of the stuff that you wrote about in in your piece
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.200]  Was accurate in that way then there was a quarter of it. I would say that was
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:09.320]  I I don't know. I don't know. I don't even know what to say about it because I just don't know could be right
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:14.120]  Could be wrong and then there was another quarter of it. I would say where I think you were wrong. Okay?
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:23.240]  So which quarter of it I don't remember specifically well about it or I think that your take on how they do
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:28.280]  Review units was wrong. Okay
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.360]  And obviously this is a little bit self-serving and so, you know
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.320]  Anybody both you and anybody listening feel free to take it
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.680]  you know with your eyes rolled or with a big grain of salt because obviously it's it I don't want to come across as
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:48.440]  Defensive but you can obviously see how it might be but not to put words in your mouth but or in your piece
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.840]  But the gist of it was that your take was that they cede review units to
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:55.640]  known friendly outlets
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:57.640]  That's fair to say yeah, right
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:58.680]  I don't think that's true
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:04.920]  And in fact, I think I can think of some counter examples where they cede them to people who they I think know are actually sort
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:10.920]  Of not friendly and I would file for example the verge under that and I wouldn't say the verge is hostile
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.680]  And I know that the verge is under has the most bizarre readership possible where half of their readers
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:22.920]  Think that they are in the bag for apple and the other half think that they are in the bag for apple
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:28.680]  And the other half think that they're the worst anti-apple agitators on the entire internet
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:30.680]  Right, and it's very bizarre to me
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920]  But I would say that the verge for example
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:38.040]  I and I think to placate the half that thinks that they're in the bag for apple that the verge
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:45.560]  Consistently bends over backwards to great apple on a curve that doesn't apply to other devices and that if they
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:50.840]  It's been it's my and the fact though that they still have top tier access to
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.240]  Access to apple review units
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.120]  Is proof to me that they don't really
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:00.840]  Seed out friendly reviewers. Well, I mean my response to that now
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:06.200]  I don't want to say that I remember my discussions with whoever I talked to for these profiles
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.880]  However long ago this was six seven eight nine months ago
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  But if I remember correctly
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.520]  Apple stopped giving the verge review units. They did there was the one um
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:22.360]  That is true. And it was so I don't think that counterexample is completely valid just to be it's it's a good point
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:25.560]  That's an excellent point. I forget when it was i'm
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.560]  90
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.680]  Sure
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.960]  Topolsky was still there and if I believe I think it was two years ago. You should have asked them last week
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.760]  Yeah, I should have I forgot about it. I
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.920]  Think it was two
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.680]  Two years ago that they didn't get early access to the phone
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:46.840]  Right, and then they but they did get day before access
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:50.200]  And so see there's different tiers, right?
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  There's the right after the keynote or a couple weeks in advance
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.960]  Which I believe that you've been traditionally a part of the last few years, right?
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:02.200]  Then there's the day before day of or a couple days before
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:07.480]  And then there's the review units given after the products available
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.160]  That's correct. I think that there are three tiers one is and
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:13.160]  And to my knowledge, there's nobody
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:17.480]  Nobody on the nobody is on a pre
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.680]  keynote tier even mosberg
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:25.160]  Who I would think would if anybody would be it would be mosberg and I think right
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.680]  post new york times is
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.200]  I think you know, he still gets he's still on tier one, but I
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.760]  I think everybody would agree that since he's gone to yahoo. He's lost a bit of relevancy
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:43.640]  Yeah, I don't want to speak negatively about it right and it's it's all catty and inside baseball but it's right, you know
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.640]  Just being trying to be as honest as I can I think mosberg is the only one
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.880]  it's not like it used to be right it used to be that mosberg pogue ed begg and
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:00.920]  Steven lee v while he was still at newsweek that they're the four who got the iphone and nobody else got the iphone before the iphone
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.960]  came out
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:08.440]  And nobody else got the iphone before the iphone came out. Um, that there were only four reviewers who mattered
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:14.680]  And the world has changed greatly since then and apple pr's perspective on this stuff has changed greatly since then
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:18.440]  But as of right now, I think you're correct that there's three tiers post keynote
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.680]  uh
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:27.320]  day or two before which I think is largely the reason it's like a day or two is that
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.440]  to my knowledge
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.480]  uh
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:36.040]  And again, I could be I could be wrong about certain people but i'd i've never heard of an exception
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:42.200]  Nobody ever gets a review unit of serious hardware something that that is worth being in a keynote
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.920]  There are minor things that they might ship to to reviewers
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:48.120]  But if it's a flagship new product
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:51.880]  The only way you can get a review unit is to have a product briefing with apple
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:55.640]  sure, where they give you know, they give it to you by hand and
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:00.360]  Tell you in a per, you know, one to one or one to two, you know, whatever meeting
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.040]  um
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:08.680]  You know what they think about it and what their main points are about it and therefore with an expanded. Um,
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:12.840]  Like I get the impression and I don't know when everybody got apple watches
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:18.040]  but I got the impression that like the second tier for the apple watch was spread over two or three days because I think
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:20.040]  They gave them to so many people
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.200]  that there was no way that they could do it all like
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:25.080]  two days before the watch came out like
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:31.640]  April 22nd, some of the people got april 23rd because there just aren't that isn't that way to meet that many people with a briefing
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.880]  When did you get yours a week before?
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:39.160]  Yeah, like a week and a half before okay. Is that early a week and a half?
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.400]  It's normal for most products a lot of the time you could there's no
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.840]  The I don't even have to be secret I get with a watch
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:52.520]  I don't think i'm I think of the nda I signed I can't say exactly when I got it
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:58.600]  But it was roughly a week and a half. Um with most products. There's a keynote, right? So for example
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.320]  When the phones come out
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:10.280]  Uh, there's a keynote you get your review unit after the keynote in a product briefing and then the the embargo is always like
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.400]  Wednesday, I always I actually miss that. I I don't know but the products you don't follow those
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.400]  You you wait till I try to I try my best mark I do
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:24.840]  uh, the embargo is usually like wednesday like like 48 hours before
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:29.000]  They go on sale on friday or the pre-ordered one start shipping
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:34.840]  Um, so like a monday keynote or a tuesday keynote with a wednesday embargo the next day
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.720]  You know, usually it's usually they're like eight or nine day periods
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:42.360]  Yeah, and I think that some I don't i'd have to look at a calendar, but I think that the watch
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920]  review units were
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.160]  eight or nine days
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:51.480]  Which felt way too sure it felt to me like I had to watch for two days. It was
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.520]  Like I have my watch here. It took time to get used to it to want to wear it to want to use it
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:57.480]  You know, yeah
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:03.320]  So now i've said before and i'll say it again hardest hardest review i've ever written and I think it stands up and i'm pretty
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:08.280]  Proud of what I wrote but it's the the pieces I wrote later in the month. I think are way more
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:13.240]  Like relevant and like years from now when I look back at what I thought of the original apple watch
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.800]  It's the the further pieces I wrote
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:20.360]  Weeks later, I think are more more telling I think apple did it themselves a disservice
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:27.560]  Waiting until that short before the launch to give it to their viewers, but maybe that has to do with the software not being ready
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.760]  Yeah, I really am not sure about that and I wonder how much they went back and forth on that
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.160]  And I think that they knew I I in fact just talk talking to people at apple
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.560]  I know that they knew that it takes time to really get that, you know
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.400]  that you know
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:51.400]  To acclimate it to your life like it really doesn't kick in until you stop thinking about it
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:54.360]  Honestly, and I know that sounds stupid, but it's no I know
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:02:01.880]  Everybody I know who has one agrees that it's when you stop thinking about it that it really starts hitting you and you're like
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:05.480]  You know what? I am walking a lot more, you know and stuff like that
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:11.240]  anyway, though I in my experience and who knows it the but the the
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:14.680]  I I don't think that they seed out
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:20.200]  Known to be friendly reviewers. I think that they look for and again
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:26.200]  This is going to sound self-serving for me. But I think they look in general for reviewers who are a
[02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:32.280]  Have a big following and that they're going to write, you know to get into tier one
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:38.600]  You have to have a certain amount of influence and so i'm weird because I don't have a large audience
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.200]  But I think that they consider the daring fireball audience to be influential
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:51.240]  Again, this sounds terribly self-serving and i'm blushing as I say it but I don't like talking about myself like this
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.560]  But I don't think they look for a positive review
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:59.320]  I think they look generally for people who are going to get it who are getting what it is that they're going after
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:06.760]  And I I never get notes after I write my reviews never not a word from them about anything
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.360]  not a word from them about anything I am in my
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  Honestly, I really think that they just want reviewers to be fair that's the to me the main thing that they're after
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:22.760]  And the thing that makes this all so hard to judge
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.880]  Is that for the last?
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:30.120]  Decade but at least in the time that i've been doing it
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:36.680]  It's been an unbelievable string of very good products and i've done this occasionally
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:41.000]  I've looked back at old reviews of things like my what I wrote about, you know
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:51.000]  Like the verizon iphone or iphone 4s and stuff like that and that did what I write hold up or was I
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:56.120]  Excited because it was new and i've so far i've not found one where I felt like I missed the mark
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:00.280]  I missed the mark and even looking at people who've been doing it longer than I have like in
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:04.360]  rereading like say david pogue's original review of the iphone
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:10.520]  In 2007 and stuff like that. I don't think that these reviews were positive just for the sake of being positive
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:14.300]  I think almost all of them were spot on and in fact some of them especially
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:22.120]  uh, like the mosberg ones, I think sometimes bend over backwards to emphasize things that just weren't that big a deal like
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:28.440]  You know devoting time in a 2007 review of the iphone to talk about how it doesn't have a hardware keyboard like a blackberry
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.440]  Which actually looked bad. It was like wow. Here's the cons, you know, a blackberry has a hardware keyboard and you can type faster on it
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:41.240]  And what about the map stuff a lot of people miss the the maps problems in their iphone 5 reviews
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:44.680]  Um, I don't remember yours in particular. I don't remember that either
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.320]  Siri as well siri
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:54.440]  Was not a great product at launch, but people seem to have missed some of the uh, lack of functionality or accuracy there
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:57.480]  The iphone 4 antenna. I mean, I know that's
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:01.640]  That's a subject that we can spend another two hours on but yeah
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.300]  I miss that siri is a good example. I remember with maps in particular
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:11.800]  I think I remember thinking I missed the boat on that because I don't think I said anything one way or the other but
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.840]  Part of it was that in the course of my testing I didn't go anywhere and I was at home with the map
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:22.280]  I was at home in philadelphia and their maps in philadelphia as far as I did test them were pretty good
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:30.520]  And it really seemed like the bigger problems with the initial 1.0 maps weren't so much in major metropolitan areas
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:35.720]  But just about everywhere else. That's fair. Yeah, and the you know driving turn by turn directions
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:41.880]  You know, I don't drive most days. So if you know, but again that doesn't necessarily i'm not saying that that means i'm above blame
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.960]  I mean, it's it's it was a
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:48.840]  I would rather my goal is always to be right and I want my reviews to I want to
[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:53.640]  My reviews like when people look back at them in 10 years to be like, well, he really nailed it
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.800]  and I think it's hard to say for the
[02:05:57.320 --> 02:06:01.240]  So, what was that iowa 6? Yes iphone 5. Yep
[02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:07.880]  It's hard to say that a review of iphone the iowa 6 and iphone 5 that if it didn't mention
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:13.400]  Maps and the problems that it had that it's accurate in the long term, but I don't think people avoided it trying to curry favor
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:16.760]  With apple pr I I don't I I can't say that for everybody
[02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:21.880]  But I really don't I I've never felt pressure like that at all from from apple
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:24.120]  right
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.320]  I really don't think so. But the the tell is going to be
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:32.200]  When the day comes that apple releases a product that is not that good
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:36.760]  that's well the iphone 5 and the maps thing is a pretty good indicator there, but
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:41.080]  Yeah, but the iphone 5 itself was actually a pretty it was a great device
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:47.960]  Yeah, but I mean maps was part of that siri siri was the iphone 4s's main feature really
[02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.680]  You know
[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:52.680]  We'll see. We'll see
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:57.640]  Uh, I don't know I just think that I I just you know again, I think it was an
[02:06:57.640 --> 02:07:01.560]  I just you know again, I think it was an an interesting piece and I will
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:04.120]  Absolutely positively put this one in the show notes
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:06.920]  I'm making a note to myself right now because anybody who hasn't read it
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:14.440]  You certainly can go back and nobody has ever written anything like this before or since because I kind of get the sense that you've got
[02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:17.640]  A fuck it. I don't care what they think attitude towards them
[02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:23.160]  Like I don't think that you were trying to antagonize anybody with this article. I no not at all. This was about
[02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:25.880]  More so so I never had
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:33.720]  Access like I mean you admit to having off the record conversations with them. I I mean i've never had all sorts of access
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:37.260]  This started as sort of a research project to understand
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:45.400]  How they operate and why they operate this way in order so I could better understand my work my future work what i've done in the past
[02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:49.560]  But in terms of that attitude, it doesn't really stem from an attitude
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:55.080]  It stems from not having anything to lose. I have no relationship to lose. I feel that my work
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:57.240]  Is so much better off
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:02.620]  Being independent me doing how what I want how I get to spread information
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:05.240]  Not having to fear that apples
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:11.080]  Maybe not going to give me a review unit or talk to me if I say something or position something or break something
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:15.080]  You know the day that I you know work with a company on a story
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:19.720]  and get it out there from their angles the day that I don't want to do this anymore because
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:26.040]  I'm, very happy with the way that I do my work and how I do it my way. It's not a screw-it type of thing
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:31.500]  Let's publish this. It's more of a that's just my mindset how I how I like working independently
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.600]  Yeah, I my perspective on it is
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:42.040]  So weird because I never really expected that I would be in this position because when I started during fireball it was you know
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.600]  2002 and it was you know before
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:46.840]  before
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:52.200]  The apple, you know stuff was even that big of a deal right like ipods came out at little
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.160]  miniature events in town hall and stuff like that
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:57.080]  um
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:01.960]  And then the iphone came out and it was so big and such a huge deal, but they were you know
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:05.560]  Reviewing it's only like I said only went to four people, right? Um
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.520]  And i'd built this whole thing up and turned it into you know
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:14.840]  Something that I could call a career and it was successful all without any of that
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:19.080]  right and in all the ways that it was successful before I had any kind of
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.480]  You know
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.480]  It access to apple pr
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:28.680]  Uh, it's still the same way. So like if I stopped getting i've said this, you know, uh, you know
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:31.080]  Like jim dowell and I have talked about it
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:37.320]  Like I never have any assumption that i'm getting any future and I know this sounds like i'm now it sounds like i'm being
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:39.480]  uh
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:47.000]  Falsely humble, but honestly, like I I don't I if I had to bet I guess i'll get the iphone 6s come
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:52.600]  September but if I don't if like the call doesn't come and then you know, and and I there's no
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:55.160]  Brief, there's no briefing after the keynote
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:59.000]  I'll be like, well, I don't know. I must have I don't know. I don't know what happened there
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:04.200]  But must have had mark on my podcast too many times. Yeah, I don't maybe maybe it's because I had you on my podcast
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.280]  I don't know but it's it's not gonna hurt
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.840]  It's not gonna hurt my revenue at all. Like I don't have any kind of ad
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.040]  You know, I do get a lot of hits on the reviews when they come out
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:17.880]  Sure, the deck ads don't go by page, you know page count
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:22.920]  It's you know every and it by by design like I don't want to have uh
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.480]  Articles like that. I don't have articles where I get I make more money if they get read more right it just for one thing
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:33.080]  Uh, so if it dries up it dries up, you know, or if you know
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.440]  if if somebody leaves somebody who's like a big fan of me and apple pr
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:41.080]  Is the reason i'm getting these things and then they quit and take a job somewhere else and I stopped getting them
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.160]  So be it clearly wasn't katie cotton
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.720]  uh, i'm just kidding, I guess not I I wrote about when she left I
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:52.360]  I was blown away that she even knew who I was but she was always very nice to me
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.000]  I have no idea what what she was like in private though. I you know, I clearly though strategically
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.880]  She had a different vision for apple pr and that that's the other reason I wanted to bring it up that you wrote about this
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:05.000]  I kind of feel like your piece serves as as
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:10.440]  Well definitive is the wrong word because I do think that there are gaps and I don't see how you could have filled them in
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:13.160]  This is the thing. I don't mean this is like hey, you could have done a better job
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.720]  I almost feel like it's remarkable how much
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  You got colored in
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:23.880]  But I kind of feel like it was a kind of amazing timing
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:27.400]  Coming at the end of the katie cotton era, you know
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:33.480]  Because clearly strategically apple pr has has taken a strategic turn since then right and in this story
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:38.040]  I know I talked about like who would replace katie cotton and I said it would be steve dowling
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:42.680]  And all indications are pointing to him instead of carris who was still at apple at the time
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.400]  And you know, I got a lot of you know
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.960]  Criticism privately saying how could you say that there's no way that's true and all that but you know
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:55.560]  Look at the pr bios page now. So oh my my impression and I again I
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:57.080]  again, I
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:02.780]  It's funny because I have like an official relationship with apple pr that you don't have but like my unofficial
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:05.880]  You know back channel
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:11.480]  Input into the way apple pr works is way cloudier than yours for sure
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:13.880]  Like there were names that you had that i'd never heard of
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.880]  Uh and stuff that you know asking around, you know, people are like, yeah. Yeah, that's that's pretty accurate that i'd never heard of
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.080]  um, but my sense from the outside was that it was
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:32.600]  I i'm almost surprised they didn't name dowling sooner and in my guess I could be wrong I could be
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:37.080]  So totally wrong here that it's it there's people at apple who you know
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.080]  We're just laughing if they're listening to this
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:45.480]  But my sense was that the delay in naming dowling was simply out of respect to katie that her departure was not
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:49.400]  Uh, it was amicable. It was we're gonna you know, I think she had been there a long time
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.480]  I think she was ready for a break and I think tim cook was looking for a new direction
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:57.800]  But it wasn't like bad blood. It wasn't like she was pushed out the door like forestall
[02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:05.480]  And therefore out of respect they didn't name a successor right away. I you know, I honestly disagree with that. Okay, I could be wrong
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:11.960]  No, no, I don't think that it was as bad blood as the forestall situation because you know, they talked
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:16.600]  Massive crap about him after the right after his departure. You didn't see any of that with cotton
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.200]  But I don't think it was amicable in any sense of the word. All right amicable, but you're right. All right
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:26.440]  I I yeah, I think we're in an agreement here, right? I think we could be in the middle
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:30.600]  But yeah, I think the reason they didn't even dowling how about respectful?
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.560]  Sure, it was respectable. That's very fair to say. Yeah, she still got like
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.200]  I don't know if severance is the right word, but like advisor status or something
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:46.360]  Right stock options, but I think that they wanted to find a like a cool
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:53.160]  Big name replacement for katy cotton like they can make a splash with take the company a new friendlier direction
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:59.880]  There were those rumors of jay carney the white house guy, but they didn't find anyone better. So I think they waited
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:04.600]  Six months nine months and they didn't find anyone that they would think would be better
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:07.080]  So they named dowling and they're gonna go through him
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:11.720]  My only thing about that and I thought about that but and again, I don't know but the only
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.240]  Thing about that that I can think of is I can't think of another big splashy name other than jay carney
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:25.960]  Yeah, who else? I don't know maybe someone from a startup or something like the weird the weird world of pr in general is that
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.760]  Pr people stay under the radar
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:33.640]  Yeah, you know and that there aren't you know, like maybe like inside base?
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:37.640]  Ball, there's big names and if you work in pr, you'd be like wow, they got so and so
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:44.920]  But from the outside jay carney who was the you know, the white house, um, press what do they call his press secretary? Yep
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:51.160]  Is the only big name that I even saw tossed about as a maybe and that certainly would have been a big get
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:54.120]  But other than him, I can't think of anybody else who it would have even been
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:59.880]  Yeah, I don't know but they I guess it would be fair to say like they did their due diligence to try to find someone
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.800]  new from out of the company. It wouldn't be a great move to just promote
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.640]  Steve dowling without looking elsewhere first they need to be tactical about these types of things especially
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:13.080]  Exiting a regime that existed for 15 years
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:17.880]  Yeah, and I think the other thing too that you just it
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:24.440]  It just cannot be emphasized enough was how much that katie cotton and steve jobs were
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:32.680]  Like had like the symbiotic relationship, you know that that she was as much steve jobs as press representative as she was apples
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:37.080]  and that it that's not necessarily a bad thing because they were
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.560]  You know steve jobs and apple were so intertwined in the public eye. Yeah
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:48.360]  Like she even did all the press stuff for when steve jobs, uh sold um, pixar and disney
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:50.920]  That was an apple
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:56.360]  Right, so steve right and you know and according to um, the becoming steve jobs book
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:16:03.880]  She was one of only four apple people who were at his you know, private funeral right her q cook and
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:12.440]  Who's the fourth one johnny johnny, of course johnny, yeah, no forced all yeah and no shiller
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.160]  No, I mean, there's all sorts of people who who you know clearly worked with them a long time ago
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:22.200]  I mean, there's all sorts of people who who you know clearly worked with them a long time, but it was a very very short list
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.280]  John, you overlooked johnny because it was so obvious, right? Right, right. I saw that though
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:30.600]  I don't think the the book broke that as great as the book was I read it in your uh, your post-on
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.560]  That was great. But oh, I thought that was I thought that was I thought that was news because his family, you know
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.560]  the private family thing was
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:38.680]  so
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:42.360]  So private no. Yeah, but I remember reading that in the journal. Oh
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:47.240]  Back when 2011 or so, I believe well, I could be wrong, but I didn't know
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  I
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.400]  Uh before we go it's while we're still on the subject of katie, uh
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:17:00.760]  When I interviewed brent, uh schlender and and bruce tazzini
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:07.400]  Ted tazzelli, uh the authors of becoming steve jobs when I did the event at the apple store, uh in new york
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:10.040]  a couple months ago
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:12.120]  Um, I did a little you know
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:14.680]  interview with them in front of the the crowd
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:16.280]  um
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:22.520]  I asked them because they did get I forget who the list of people who were associated with apple who they got interviews with
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.240]  But it's you know, there's tim cook. Um
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:27.960]  Uh
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.400]  avi, you know who's not there anymore, but but you know clearly, you know
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:34.920]  Had the permission from apple to talk to them and katie
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.680]  And so they had like a whole sit-down interview with katie cotton and there's one sentence from her in the book
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:45.720]  And they but I asked about it and they both laughed
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:51.640]  and and the gist was that you know, you could take katie cotton out of apple, but
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:57.400]  It doesn't change her take on the press like she gave them nothing. That's funny. That is funny
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:01.020]  It was like one sentence and it was like totally innocuous
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:06.700]  Well, anyway, we've been going on long enough this has been great I think that everybody is now well prepared for
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:08.620]  Wwdc
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:13.820]  Uh mark german, I thank you. I will link to probably the best thing I can link to is your
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.740]  Pre-wwdc wrap-up posts because you're you keep updating that right?
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:22.540]  Uh, no, we posted a new one this morning that it's one post that has everything
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:25.180]  All right. I will link to that in the show notes
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:29.020]  Appreciate it. And then if anything breaks over the weekend, you'll update that same post. Yes
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:32.460]  All right, that's great
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:37.340]  And people can read you regularly. I'm sure they already do they can either read you at
[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:40.480]  There are two places you can find mark at nine to five mac.com
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:43.920]  Or at the top of techmeme
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:53.820]  I think that they have a new ratings thing at techmeme and I believe you came out on top was is this am I overstating it?
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:59.500]  No, no, that's right. And they have a section about you in the q and a did you see that? Yeah, I did
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:04.700]  I honest to god i'm not bullshitting. Yeah, I don't know that. It's pretty funny. Yeah. Yeah, what's it? Where does it say this?
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.340]  Um on that new leaderboard page, there's a question. They did like a faq
[02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:13.340]  And the sample question is why I love john gruber
[02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:17.500]  Why is he not on the top of the list and then they have like a whole answer about how?
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:23.580]  You stick to analysis of other new stories and that doesn't really fit in with techmeme's, uh, techmeme's
[02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:29.500]  Position or goal. I honest to god did not know that now I got to put this on the goddamn show notes. How about that?
[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:33.340]  There's a fact you got to send me the link. I can't find it about these lists
[02:19:34.940 --> 02:19:38.380]  Is it the blog post about it? Uh, you know what it's probably the blog post. Yeah
[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:42.540]  I think they linked the blog post on the site. I don't know. I haven't yeah really looked at it
[02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:46.540]  Holy shit, there it is. Yeah, I did not see that
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:53.580]  Here's the answer it says I love john gruber. He's great. Why isn't he on your leadership leaderboard?
[02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:59.020]  Although he's in the top 150. He's not in the top 100 and we only show the top 100 while his posts that make techmeme
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:02.860]  Do tend to be heavily cited in the tech world. They don't appear there too often
[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:08.000]  Just twice in the last 90 days in part because he mostly posts links with short commentary
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:14.960]  Which doesn't work well for techmeme? That's exactly what i've i've never really worried about this because i've always thought it was exactly right
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:20.080]  Yeah, yeah, i've talked to gabe about this. I met gabe years ago at like an o'reilly conference the guy
[02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:26.400]  You know the the guy behind techmeme and we talked he we talked about years ago about how i'm like an exception who doesn't fit
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:30.080]  Into the techmeme thing, but I said, you know, I don't break news
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:34.560]  That's what this is about is I get you know, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't expect to be there sure
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:40.080]  I expect to link to people who are there
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:44.800]  Like exactly. Yeah, that's fascinating. I did not realize that I was listed there
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.720]  The next question. I hate tech crunch. They're jerks. Why is tech crunch number one on the publication leaderboard?
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.020]  Oh, that's great. I gotta send that to panzerino
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:58.960]  That is fantastic. What a great question
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:04.240]  I'm, so glad they so glad they answered my question, you know, he's doing a great job there matt
[02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:07.920]  He really is. He's absolutely doing a great job there
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:14.640]  He broke the the tim tim cook, uh epic, uh, right the privacy speech
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:19.360]  I I think that would that was going to come out no matter what but somehow he was on the ball and had that before
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.520]  Before the recording even came out, yeah
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:31.760]  All right, so nine to five mac. That's where mark, uh is kicking ass as an apple reporter who who?
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:34.240]  Really doesn't give a crap what apple thinks of him?
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.840]  All for the better for the rest of us. I really do mean it. I think you're doing great work and like i've said
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:44.400]  uh talking about you on these podcasts the last few weeks I
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:48.160]  Here's the most amazing thing to me is I don't know where we would be without you
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.640]  Well, I know where we'd be we'd be in the dark, you know
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:56.240]  but it's absolutely astounding if somebody went around and assembled and i'm sure mac rumors will like
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:59.460]  What's the consensus on what's coming at wwdc?
[02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:00.580]  wwdc
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:05.300]  uh a remarkable majority of that information is is from you so
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:10.020]  Yeah, keep up keep up the good work. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. All right mark
[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:14.500]  Thank you very much for your time and uh, i'll see you after wwdc. Yep
[02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:18.980]  Uh, I know that's a long long podcast, but people love them. Um
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:28.980]  Um, i'm hitting stop
