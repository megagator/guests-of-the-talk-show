[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  So live in life one-eyed
[00:02.300 --> 00:08.780]  I'll tell ya, you know, it's like, you know, everybody knows growing up that if you only have one eye you lose depth perception
[00:08.780 --> 00:12.980]  You know it and you can play with it for five minutes by closing one of your eyes or whatever
[00:12.980 --> 00:14.980]  But if you just spend two weeks with only one
[00:15.540 --> 00:17.540]  good eye
[00:17.780 --> 00:19.780]  Fucking sucks. I
[00:19.940 --> 00:24.660]  swear to God I'm always bumping into people like like in the supermarket or like
[00:24.660 --> 00:29.720]  Mm-hmm Shake Shack. I just bumped right into a guy cuz I have no idea how close I am to people
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.560]  It's not just depth perception, right? It's a blind side like you're living with the blind side
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.360]  So you have you know things coming at you from that side and you don't know they're there until the last second
[00:39.360 --> 00:42.880]  Yeah, I what did to me as a and I'm not driving
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.520]  I mean that but I live in a city so I don't need to drive but as a pedestrian when I hear footsteps
[00:48.520 --> 00:53.960]  It's my left eye and when I hear footsteps on my left from behind me, it's total freak out
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.880]  It really is it's it is bizarre because it's like I don't see them until they're in front of me
[00:59.540 --> 01:03.840]  Like a primal response. Yeah. Well, it's just years of city living
[01:03.840 --> 01:08.720]  I don't know you just if you hear footsteps behind you, you know when you're supposed to see them if they're you know
[01:08.720 --> 01:11.340]  Somebody's walking faster than you and they're gonna they're gonna pass you
[01:11.480 --> 01:17.360]  You just know when you're supposed to see them and for it's like five or six feet off for me now
[01:18.120 --> 01:20.120]  It makes you wonder how?
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.120]  Pirates got anything done. I
[01:24.880 --> 01:27.520]  Think that's why they use telescopes instead of binoculars
[01:29.360 --> 01:35.440]  That's like they're like binoculars I only need one can you can I just can I get half off if I just have the one
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.880]  So Matthew pans arena, welcome to the talk show. I can't believe it's been this long and that you've never been on the show
[01:43.120 --> 01:45.120]  Yeah, I was I was starting to get a complex
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.840]  You are my officially delegated surrogate from this week's
[01:51.040 --> 01:53.040]  Apple event two days ago
[01:53.520 --> 02:00.160]  Yeah, it was life casting. We just had a permanent meerkat open. I just hung my life casting camera around my neck
[02:00.160 --> 02:03.440]  How about that app? I I just joined yesterday. I
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.160]  Haven't done anything with it yet. But what's the deal with that meerkat? I
[02:09.200 --> 02:11.600]  Don't know. I mean it's interesting for sure. There's
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.200]  Mmm, there's been like like live streaming stuff like this for a long time, you know
[02:16.200 --> 02:21.880]  The whole Justin con Justin TV thing which turned into twitch and the whole bit. So there's it's not like that
[02:22.440 --> 02:27.040]  This is a new concept. It's just there's a bunch of factors that are all aligning to I think
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.740]  Create an uptake of it like Twitter has critical mass now LTE is everywhere
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.080]  You know, there's a variety of little things that have kind of added up to I think we're gonna see a little resurgence of this
[02:38.080 --> 02:44.160]  But meerkat itself is interesting. It's it's one tap, you know, you can start streaming immediately
[02:44.160 --> 02:48.000]  It doesn't require you set up any accounts because he uses Twitter as a backbone
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.560]  It's kind of compelling, you know, I mean I I'm not the kind of person who's gonna just stream constantly
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.200]  but if I'm doing something really interesting like my first meerkat I did was on a
[03:00.720 --> 03:03.640]  Rollercoaster at Disneyland. So a couple minutes
[03:03.640 --> 03:10.720]  Yeah, yeah a couple minutes before I got on California scream and I open it up and I started talking to people and you know
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.840]  Before I knew it 30 40 people are on there, right and they're just watching me stand in the line for the rollercoaster
[03:15.840 --> 03:19.780]  And so I said, okay, we're gonna get on I was like give them a little rollercoaster history
[03:19.780 --> 03:22.400]  You know why this roller coaster was different than other ones blah blah blah
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.680]  And I just sat there and like 30 people came along with me on the ride. I held it up
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.240]  I was in front row. I held it up and they rode the roller coaster with me, which I thought was interesting
[03:31.240 --> 03:36.960]  So I but if anybody out there doesn't know so meerkat, it's an iPhone app
[03:36.960 --> 03:43.160]  I don't think it's is there an iPad version or is it iPhone only? No, it's just iPhone. So it's iPhone only no website
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.680]  No Android
[03:44.680 --> 03:49.860]  Not that I know of no. No, I don't get iPhone only you sign in with Twitter
[03:49.860 --> 03:50.920]  You have to you know
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.600]  Twitter is the only option you sign in with your Twitter account and if you want to you can start
[03:55.800 --> 04:00.180]  Streaming at any time and I guess it uses the FaceTime camera and or I guess either camera
[04:00.180 --> 04:02.180]  Yeah, either you can flip it back and forth
[04:02.180 --> 04:07.500]  Yeah, and when you hit stream it tweets for you and just says whatever you want it to say like hey
[04:07.500 --> 04:09.620]  I'm outside the Apple event or hey
[04:09.620 --> 04:12.960]  I'm going on Space Mountain and then you're you know
[04:12.960 --> 04:16.740]  your Twitter followers will see the tweet and if they want to they they
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.300]  Tap a thing and it takes them over to the meerkat app and they can watch it with you
[04:21.980 --> 04:23.220]  Yeah
[04:23.220 --> 04:28.700]  It's extremely simple. The interface just has a little row of icons that kind of show you the Twitter
[04:28.700 --> 04:33.700]  profile picture of the people that are watching and then they can when they
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.980]  Reply to you in app it tweets publicly. So the conversation happens in public on Twitter
[04:38.980 --> 04:39.860]  Oh, right, right, right
[04:39.860 --> 04:44.260]  And that is I think essential to it is there when they reply to you the tweets show up in the app
[04:44.780 --> 04:50.660]  itself so you could hold like and I saw a bunch of a whole bunch of people did this after the Apple event as they'd
[04:50.660 --> 04:57.180]  Hold a meerkat session and do like Q&A and their Twitter followers could say hey am I can I just buy the Milanese band?
[04:57.180 --> 05:02.100]  On my own. Yes. Yes, you can, you know, whatever but they can ask the questions and you see them
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.900]  Right, and I think that that feedback that instantaneous access to people is compelling. I have a
[05:09.740 --> 05:15.940]  I'm kind of thinking about this like what does it do? What is the purpose? I mean, I don't know what the purpose is
[05:15.940 --> 05:19.900]  I don't know whether they're gonna be able to monetize it. I don't know whether it's a fad, you know
[05:19.900 --> 05:20.660]  I don't know any of that stuff
[05:20.660 --> 05:25.540]  I'm not trying to predict the future on that but it does seem interesting to me as a sort of empathy machine
[05:25.540 --> 05:26.820]  because
[05:26.820 --> 05:32.180]  When you see produced video of a person there's a disconnect, you know, it's something that's not live
[05:32.180 --> 05:39.880]  It's not immediate and I think that snapchat meerkat vine a lot of these things that are producing sort of rawer content
[05:40.700 --> 05:43.820]  Those are kind of all along the lines of these empathy machines where they
[05:44.100 --> 05:50.460]  Create a feeling of empathy with the person that you're watching and the person that's viewing and so that's an interesting thing to me
[05:50.460 --> 05:54.740]  Whether or not it'll last I don't know but that's that's kind of something to watch
[05:54.740 --> 05:58.860]  I think it seems to me my first take and I I'm
[05:59.540 --> 06:05.260]  Late to pick this up. Like I said, I don't even signed up for it yesterday. I think or maybe the day before but
[06:06.820 --> 06:09.760]  It and I get when did it come out like last week
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.500]  Yeah, it's it's kind of a long story
[06:12.500 --> 06:16.020]  They had they had this other thing and then they they stopped doing it because they had a lot of problems
[06:16.020 --> 06:18.700]  But this was an offshoot of that and a couple of weeks ago
[06:18.700 --> 06:24.420]  they put it on product hunt and it just kind of took off from product hunt and a bunch of the
[06:24.780 --> 06:28.060]  Technorati started using it and then you know because that it's
[06:28.820 --> 06:31.180]  It's sort of an incestuous Twitter group
[06:31.220 --> 06:36.480]  Everybody started grabbing it and watching that the streams and then creating their own because like I said, it's one tap
[06:36.480 --> 06:42.500]  So once you open the app, you can start streaming immediately. There's no complicated setup. No, and it's you know, it
[06:43.180 --> 06:47.660]  it does seem like a typical Valley venture play because surely the
[06:47.660 --> 06:53.060]  The all this free streaming is costing them money. I mean streaming is not cheap
[06:54.540 --> 07:01.140]  Right, right. Absolutely. It's not it's it's got to take us a nice backbone of server architecture to
[07:01.700 --> 07:05.780]  Execute and Twitter just actually bought an unlaunched
[07:06.540 --> 07:09.300]  Sort of version of meerkat called periscope
[07:10.180 --> 07:15.660]  We we're we heard that they'd bought it a week ago and I guess somebody else just confirmed it yesterday or whatever
[07:15.660 --> 07:21.780]  But it's it's very interesting in terms of a Twitter accessory, you know, yeah
[07:22.100 --> 07:26.840]  Well, but that's interesting too though that they Twitter just bought somebody who does the same thing because to me
[07:26.840 --> 07:30.700]  It seems as though meerkats play is to get bought by Twitter
[07:31.340 --> 07:36.520]  Right because right it's and I don't blame them like in some sense in some ways
[07:36.740 --> 07:43.860]  Putting the business aside and who's gonna buy whether you're hoping to IPO or whether you're hoping that's Twitter buys you or somebody it's
[07:43.860 --> 07:49.740]  it's very interesting to me that the one and only way to sign into the thing is Twitter that they're
[07:49.980 --> 07:53.660]  Completely building it as a I mean and who knows they might change that in the future
[07:53.660 --> 07:59.160]  but at least right now it is completely built on the back of Twitter and right like you said the
[07:59.380 --> 08:01.620]  The replies go out as tweets
[08:01.740 --> 08:08.020]  Everything is a public conversation outside of meerkat on Twitter other than the stream itself, which is in meerkat
[08:08.340 --> 08:13.120]  Yeah, and I think they did that. I think the founder said something I was watching a little thread with them
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.040]  I didn't ask him personally, but he said that they did it that way because their previous product which was also a streaming product of
[08:19.040 --> 08:20.300]  some sort
[08:20.300 --> 08:27.500]  they had a lot of problems with trolling, you know with people streaming and then people jumping on there and creating usernames or whatever and being
[08:28.140 --> 08:29.620]  acidic or or
[08:29.620 --> 08:34.500]  You know crappy to people streaming and so they they said that the public conversation
[08:35.020 --> 08:37.540]  Actually worked better people were more on
[08:37.540 --> 08:46.140]  On point I believe you know, but and also it also sort of puts the onus on Twitter to handle the creation of throwaway
[08:46.140 --> 08:48.140]  spam accounts
[08:49.260 --> 08:55.500]  Something Twitter obviously has to be doing anyway, it's not certainly not like they're adding to Twitter's burden
[08:56.120 --> 08:57.400]  No, no
[08:57.400 --> 09:03.820]  I mean they it's a smart move to offload any of the complexities of creating a commenting structure or
[09:03.820 --> 09:08.060]  account management to another network as long as your model
[09:08.900 --> 09:14.740]  Isn't hurt by the fact that you're not owning your network. And so that's as you mentioned. That's one of the key things
[09:14.740 --> 09:15.940]  It's like what are they trying to do?
[09:15.940 --> 09:21.980]  Well, it seems like they need to be sort of held in the bosom of a larger thing unless they figure out a way
[09:22.420 --> 09:26.400]  To monetize it that doesn't remove the simplicity, you know
[09:26.400 --> 09:32.300]  What are you gonna do meerkat with like sponsored by such-and-such layered over the top of it? I don't know maybe you know
[09:32.300 --> 09:34.300]  so
[09:36.340 --> 09:38.340]  You did a meerkat from outside the event
[09:38.940 --> 09:43.900]  Yeah, I did. Yeah, so I pop why I did actually one kind of inside the event just before it
[09:44.660 --> 09:49.180]  You know, they typically get kind of angry at you if you stream the stuff because they're already streaming it or whatever
[09:49.180 --> 09:54.580]  So I just did a little bit before the event to let people see what what was going on inside there and then a little
[09:54.580 --> 10:00.660]  Bit from the demo room and you know kind of let people walk around and and and then I did did a question Q&A
[10:00.660 --> 10:02.220]  afterwards
[10:02.220 --> 10:04.220]  in the st. Regis, which is
[10:05.060 --> 10:08.740]  Across the street and I'll just set in the lobby there and answered a bunch of questions people
[10:09.460 --> 10:15.020]  Were tweeting me about like the watch and the laptop and stuff. Just trying to stream of consciousness it. Yeah
[10:15.620 --> 10:17.900]  Yeah, yeah, how many people do you get watching those?
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.960]  Like the the final Q&A did I think I got like 250 or so. Wow, that's pretty good
[10:24.540 --> 10:29.220]  Yeah, I mean as a fraction of people as remember this is a synchronous thing, right?
[10:29.220 --> 10:33.620]  It's you cannot it's not asynchronous in any way shape or form people have to be fully dedicated
[10:34.140 --> 10:36.560]  Their whole iPhone screen is given over to you
[10:36.560 --> 10:41.780]  This is why by the way, these VCs are salivating right and looking at these apps and going like oh my god
[10:41.780 --> 10:44.580]  You know because you're actually reaching out and taking over
[10:45.340 --> 10:52.620]  Somebody's complete attention and their entire screen of their iPhone and anytime you can do that. I mean, that's that's insane, you know
[10:52.620 --> 10:56.540]  Yeah, I think that the next five years is gonna be a
[10:56.540 --> 10:58.040]  A
[10:58.040 --> 10:59.540]  Transition it's already started
[10:59.540 --> 11:06.060]  I think to me it started with Instagram when Instagram started iPhone only and that's you know years ago at this point
[11:06.700 --> 11:12.100]  But I feel like Instagram was so far ahead of its time in terms of going app only
[11:12.180 --> 11:19.740]  To launch and I feel like the next five years is gonna be a transition in that direction and not even just phone only
[11:19.740 --> 11:23.300]  I mean clearly eventually, you know, you could go watch only at this point
[11:23.300 --> 11:26.260]  I mean as we'll get into over the course of the show, but that
[11:27.220 --> 11:31.160]  Doing a website and making it a web service that anybody can just go to
[11:31.480 --> 11:34.620]  You know, I guess it would be meerkat.com or whatever is
[11:35.300 --> 11:39.300]  old way of thinking and not that it's a bad not that it's bad and
[11:39.420 --> 11:45.060]  Not that there won't be in the future brand new things that start as websites and have success and they're appropriate
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.020]  It's just that there are certain ideas and concepts that work
[11:50.020 --> 11:54.020]  Better or best or maybe even only as an app
[11:55.380 --> 11:59.780]  Yeah, yeah, I absolutely agree. I think you're you're sort of unlocking
[12:00.820 --> 12:06.420]  I would have to say most of it is around is built around context right because the mobile device
[12:06.860 --> 12:11.780]  Offers, there's only really one context for web and that's that somebody's looking at their computer screen
[12:12.120 --> 12:18.820]  Whereas the context for mobile is a lot of things your location your speed your the weather, right?
[12:18.820 --> 12:22.460]  There's lots of other things that are coming into play when you have a mobile device
[12:22.460 --> 12:26.940]  They could be literally anywhere in the world at any altitude above the surface of the planet
[12:26.940 --> 12:31.900]  You know or below and all of a sudden you've got a lot of a lot more variety of stuff, you know
[12:31.900 --> 12:37.940]  What if somebody's creates a version of meerkat just for spelunkers, right? Oh, I you know, I love spelunking
[12:37.940 --> 12:42.140]  I want to watch the spelunking channel. Well, it's no longer a channel on a website
[12:42.140 --> 12:44.800]  It's a that's a bespoke app, you know
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.260]  Just watching spelunkers go down in caves and I think that there's gonna be a lot of interesting stuff like that whether or not those
[12:50.260 --> 12:52.260]  Will scale I don't know, you know
[12:52.260 --> 12:58.340]  but the other thing too and I think you touched on this a few minutes ago is that it's like with LTE and it's
[12:58.540 --> 13:05.200]  pervasiveness and it's relative incredible speed is just how far we've come so quickly like
[13:05.900 --> 13:07.620]  You know eight
[13:07.620 --> 13:10.860]  Seven years ago when we had the original iPhone it
[13:10.860 --> 13:16.060]  It didn't even do video and let alone have a front-facing camera
[13:16.060 --> 13:21.740]  I had one camera shooting in the back didn't do video period and had edge
[13:22.420 --> 13:28.940]  cellular networking which really struggled even to load complex web pages and
[13:30.420 --> 13:33.500]  Seven years later people are streaming live
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.940]  high definition
[13:35.940 --> 13:43.060]  Video from this from the secondary camera on the device. Yeah, I mean and it's it's really good
[13:43.060 --> 13:48.780]  I mean the video quality is pretty solid. I mean there are some finicky stuff. There's some finicky stuff about it
[13:48.780 --> 13:53.220]  I think they need to improve but it's I mean, I've watched streams obviously and it's
[13:54.420 --> 13:55.380]  transportive, you know
[13:55.380 --> 13:59.900]  You're you're there and that is insane the fact that we can
[14:00.180 --> 14:05.380]  And I've walked around with it and moved and I remember I remember with video streaming
[14:05.380 --> 14:07.500]  they went through this we went through this whole period where
[14:08.140 --> 14:10.140]  they the
[14:10.260 --> 14:16.260]  Bandwidth was so poor on cellular, but just enough but but too poor to really support it
[14:16.260 --> 14:20.260]  Where you would get this bursty thing where just like oh, you know, it's fine
[14:20.260 --> 14:24.600]  And then it's really really bad for ten minutes and that that would kill it right you would be like
[14:24.600 --> 14:27.340]  I'm not gonna watch this. This is annoying, you know, it's stuttery or whatever
[14:27.340 --> 14:33.100]  So any if any one of those little factors doesn't work then live-streaming doesn't work. So now we've got all the kind of pieces
[14:33.100 --> 14:36.380]  So it'll be interesting to see if it actually explodes this time. Yeah
[14:37.940 --> 14:44.940]  Yeah, I think it definitely caught my eye and the design of the app did too like it is like you said
[14:44.940 --> 14:50.220]  It's one tap and to me. I know it's like you think like well there, you know, they have a simple idea
[14:50.220 --> 14:54.740]  It's really hard to get there design-wise to get in so that you can do something like that
[14:54.740 --> 15:00.060]  Like this the more brain-dead simple stupid something looks the harder
[15:00.060 --> 15:05.300]  It was to get from the original idea down to that, you know one button away from streaming
[15:06.020 --> 15:10.780]  Simplicity right one of the indicators that I see of how easy it is
[15:10.780 --> 15:11.980]  It's actually funny
[15:11.980 --> 15:15.940]  But I've seen this a lot because I've been kind of watching it as I picked it up a couple weeks ago
[15:15.940 --> 15:20.900]  And then and have been investigating other stories about other similar setups as I've been I've been kind of
[15:21.500 --> 15:24.180]  monitoring which people join and when they start streaming and
[15:24.180 --> 15:30.120]  I've noticed that almost everybody you you didn't because I got the push notification for you joining
[15:30.420 --> 15:34.900]  But because it basically uses your Twitter network, so you're I'm gonna get a notification for anybody
[15:34.900 --> 15:37.580]  I follow on Twitter joining it right, right, but I
[15:38.260 --> 15:44.540]  Noticed that almost everybody joins and then immediately starts streaming and I'm convinced it's because they think there's more steps
[15:45.060 --> 15:47.060]  And they hit the stream button
[15:47.540 --> 15:53.880]  And it just starts dreaming and by the time I see the notification and then I go in they've already stopped and I haven't
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.100]  I need to ask somebody who does it next time they do it
[15:56.100 --> 15:59.940]  Did you just do it because you thought there'd be like more setup or more steps?
[15:59.940 --> 16:02.060]  And I think it's because they go
[16:02.060 --> 16:04.420]  Oh, there's got to be more and they just hit the stream button to see
[16:04.420 --> 16:07.100]  Oh, what do I have to do to set this up and boom their cameras on them?
[16:07.100 --> 16:12.860]  They're like, oh and then they shut it off. Well, it's a funny thing too. I'm not even funny, but just interesting and to me
[16:12.940 --> 16:18.180]  You know it I I'd be shocked if they don't come out with an Android version sooner rather than later
[16:18.180 --> 16:21.460]  I mean I but but going iOS first
[16:21.460 --> 16:26.480]  You in addition to being able to piggyback off Twitter and the social
[16:28.100 --> 16:34.380]  Graph as they call it the social graph that you already inherit by by using that as your thing and that you don't have to
[16:34.380 --> 16:36.940]  Create your own user account system and you don't have to police your own
[16:37.460 --> 16:39.460]  Spam account thing etcetera, etcetera
[16:39.460 --> 16:46.740]  But by going on iOS you also get the piggyback off the built-in support for Twitter accounts system-wide
[16:46.740 --> 16:50.060]  And so you don't even have to type your password you just say hey
[16:50.060 --> 16:53.420]  Me or cat wants to use your Twitter account. Is that alright?
[16:53.780 --> 16:54.300]  Yes
[16:54.300 --> 16:58.580]  use this Twitter account that I've already configured and you're in and that is
[16:58.820 --> 17:02.620]  Huge too because even if you have a shitty password, even if you're not
[17:03.700 --> 17:09.340]  you know doing the right thing and having you know uppercase and lowercase and numbers and punctuation and
[17:09.660 --> 17:12.900]  All sorts of stuff and it still is it always a pain in the ass
[17:12.900 --> 17:15.940]  It's even a pain in the ass to type in a shitty password truth be told
[17:15.940 --> 17:21.900]  And they totally get to skip that in terms of just getting people on on board
[17:23.060 --> 17:29.060]  Right and that that conversion rate goes way up when you have that access like any shopping cart, you know
[17:29.060 --> 17:32.060]  If you're logged into Amazon, they're much more likely to buy toilet paper or whatever
[17:32.060 --> 17:36.780]  Then if you're not logged in you have to find your password. So it's the same concept. Yeah, and then they well
[17:36.780 --> 17:39.380]  I'm even thinking like just to say somebody's following you and
[17:40.020 --> 17:45.820]  Maybe they've heard of meerkat whatever but then they see that you say you're tweeting from the Apple event and they're like
[17:45.820 --> 17:48.900]  Oh shit, I would like to see that. He's not even goofing around right now
[17:48.900 --> 17:53.020]  This is something follow the link download the app launch the app
[17:53.380 --> 17:59.020]  Boom, you're in like you could and like you said it's it's synchronous, you know, you have to you're doing this live
[17:59.140 --> 18:06.320]  but even somebody who hadn't even downloaded the app could catch in and jump into your stream and I would honestly say a
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.620]  Minute, right like give it 30 seconds for the app to download and third
[18:10.620 --> 18:14.940]  Well, they have a web experience so they do have a web version. It just doesn't you can't comment
[18:14.940 --> 18:18.640]  You can't see all the stuff but you can see you can watch the stream on the web
[18:18.700 --> 18:23.960]  So they did provide a web viewer like a bare-bones viewer, but it runs on flash and it's not great
[18:24.020 --> 18:30.420]  So it's sort of acts as a teaser. But yeah, I think you're right. I think you could within a minute download the app
[18:31.060 --> 18:34.940]  Log in because of obviously it's pre logged in for you essentially
[18:35.540 --> 18:39.520]  We just have to opt in and then start watching the stream. Absolutely
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.500]  Yeah, as long as somebody didn't shut down the stream within a minute, you'd be watching them
[18:42.500 --> 18:47.860]  Yeah, I think that a lot of people who are gonna join are gonna do it at some point when they see oh
[18:47.860 --> 18:53.940]  Here's a stream. I'm actually interested in starting right now. I better jump in and you can do it because of
[18:54.580 --> 18:58.640]  The you know the fact that they're piggybacking off the system
[18:59.660 --> 19:06.460]  User, you know Twitter accounts and etc. Etc. Mm-hmm. All right. Let me take a break before we start talking about the event and
[19:06.460 --> 19:13.580]  I want to talk about our first sponsor. It's our good friends at
[19:14.260 --> 19:15.540]  igloo
[19:15.540 --> 19:16.700]  igloo is
[19:16.700 --> 19:25.140]  an internet you'll actually like you can share news organize your files coordinate calendars and manage projects all in one place their
[19:25.140 --> 19:27.140]  latest upgrade Viking
[19:27.940 --> 19:30.260]  like the football team from Minnesota Viking
[19:30.820 --> 19:35.980]  Revolves around documents and how you interact with them gather feedback and make changes
[19:35.980 --> 19:37.980]  They've even added the ability to track
[19:38.420 --> 19:42.120]  Who has read critical information to keep everyone on the same page?
[19:42.220 --> 19:47.460]  So if you've got like a document that needs approval or it needs everybody to sign off on it
[19:47.460 --> 19:50.860]  You can mark it so that hey show me who's seen it and then when you post it
[19:51.500 --> 19:53.500]  to igloo, you'll get
[19:53.860 --> 19:58.380]  Like effectively read read receipts for who's seen it if you want it
[19:58.380 --> 20:02.280]  It's like read receipts in your email or an iMessage but less annoying
[20:02.280 --> 20:09.480]  and it helps you track whether your colleagues have read or acknowledged policies signed off on legal agreements or
[20:10.280 --> 20:14.240]  You know anything like that confirmed the completion of training materials, whatever
[20:15.240 --> 20:21.840]  If your company if your team has a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 90s and it probably does
[20:22.060 --> 20:26.480]  You should give igloo a try you can sign up for a free trial
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.720]  Up to ten people use it for free at igloo software
[20:30.720 --> 20:32.280]  dot-com
[20:32.280 --> 20:33.460]  slash
[20:33.460 --> 20:36.260]  TTS like the talk show TTS
[20:36.660 --> 20:40.980]  I think you can also use slash the talk show and that will work as well
[20:41.140 --> 20:47.420]  So my thanks to igloo if you have a team you need an internet to go check them out at igloo software comm slash
[20:47.940 --> 20:49.460]  TTS
[20:49.460 --> 20:51.460]  So the event Monday
[20:51.980 --> 20:54.100]  Mm-hmm. What do you think overall? I
[20:55.700 --> 20:59.300]  Thought it was good. I mean there are several standout things for me
[20:59.300 --> 21:04.420]  I mean, I think that as usual when they have said something before and they say it again
[21:04.420 --> 21:10.020]  Like this happens a lot of WWDC you get a lot of the whole rehashed stuff and people kind of tune out
[21:10.020 --> 21:14.260]  You know until they somebody says something new so there was some of that going on with the watch stuff
[21:14.340 --> 21:21.380]  but I think that there were several key things obviously leading with research kit was a very a big curveball and I think
[21:21.380 --> 21:29.080]  Anybody in my feed and and people in our back channel were we're definitely like what what we what what are we talking about?
[21:29.160 --> 21:35.600]  What is this and I think that that was a a smart move to kind of start with that and and say hey
[21:35.600 --> 21:36.920]  We're gonna talk about this
[21:36.920 --> 21:41.680]  Cool thing we're doing instead of maybe at the end where everybody's like, oh, yeah, whatever you obviously put this at the end
[21:41.680 --> 21:43.320]  Cuz nobody cares, right?
[21:43.320 --> 21:49.360]  So I think that was interesting the whole research kit thing is I think in an enormous long-term project
[21:49.360 --> 21:54.960]  I I thought it was a research kit number one. It was interesting in and of itself, but it was interesting in so far
[21:54.960 --> 21:56.700]  is that it completely
[21:56.700 --> 21:58.600]  went against the
[21:58.600 --> 22:00.600]  last two months narrative of
[22:01.360 --> 22:08.320]  Apple is totally backing away from health monitoring and all this like health and you know fitness
[22:09.840 --> 22:11.560]  Tracking stuff
[22:11.560 --> 22:19.840]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, it did fly in that face flying the face of that stuff and I don't think that wasn't calculated if that if that
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.840]  Makes sense. I think they probably definitely
[22:22.560 --> 22:27.480]  Acknowledged that it was going on and knew that it was going on and and it didn't hurt that that was right up front
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.440]  The big thing to me, obviously when he said it was open-source, I think everybody kind of was like, whoa
[22:32.440 --> 22:37.480]  You know and they didn't necessarily expect that but in hindsight it makes complete sense
[22:37.480 --> 22:41.120]  So research kit is this framework that allows
[22:42.160 --> 22:44.160]  organizations like hospitals to do
[22:45.920 --> 22:50.640]  Patient research on conditions like Parkinson's and other other conditions and gather
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.800]  feedback essentially from those patients as far as the their symptoms and their
[22:56.380 --> 22:58.380]  reactions to treatments and
[22:58.480 --> 23:00.480]  That's a that's an enormous
[23:00.480 --> 23:08.200]  You know, I hesitate to say market but it's an enormous opportunity I guess for for hospitals. Yeah
[23:08.200 --> 23:10.200]  It's it's definitely
[23:10.320 --> 23:16.400]  It is clear just from how much time they spent on it in the event that it's a major initiative and it really does seem
[23:16.400 --> 23:18.400]  as though you know, it's
[23:19.400 --> 23:22.200]  It's all new territory. There's never been anything like this before
[23:22.880 --> 23:23.400]  No
[23:23.400 --> 23:24.000]  and
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.400]  There the difference they did they said this in the keynote that a lot of the research on this is done with very small sample
[23:30.400 --> 23:34.400]  Sizes. Yeah, it's done on paper and a lot of stuff like that. And that's all accurate
[23:34.400 --> 23:36.400]  I talked to some people about this and
[23:37.120 --> 23:41.920]  You know, they're they're incredibly excited, you know people that are in this field in the medical field. They're like, whoa
[23:41.920 --> 23:48.240]  You know, this is it's gonna be awesome because yeah, the iPhone is still a demo right the iPhone owners
[23:48.240 --> 23:54.420]  That's still a demographic. So you're not necessarily getting the absolute, you know broadest spectrum
[23:54.420 --> 23:59.520]  But it's way more than a thousand people with pieces of paper, you know, so that's it's gonna be big I think
[23:59.520 --> 24:06.000]  Yeah, and with the regarding the open source, I saw a lot of cynicism in that regard
[24:07.640 --> 24:10.820]  Specifically harkening back to the announcement of FaceTime
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.800]  That's gonna bite it's gonna come back to bite them over and over. I think it's only do something about it. When was that to 2010?
[24:18.840 --> 24:23.000]  2010 2011 I don't yeah, I think I don't remember exactly but you know
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.200]  Obviously Steve Jobs was still alive because it was Steve Jobs who announced that and we're going to make it an open protocol
[24:29.200 --> 24:33.140]  I don't think he said open source. I think he said we're gonna make it an open protocol
[24:34.720 --> 24:42.800]  So that you know everybody, you know other phone makers could or computer makers whoever could make FaceTime compatible software and
[24:43.600 --> 24:45.600]  Obviously that didn't happen
[24:45.880 --> 24:53.040]  Yeah, the quote was we're going to the standards bodies starting tomorrow. We're going to make FaceTime an open industry standard
[24:53.040 --> 24:59.360]  Okay, that was in 2010 at WWDC. So there's a lot of people are like so yeah, but there's gonna be opens for the food
[24:59.360 --> 25:04.520]  right after FaceTime, but so the here's the thing this truly is one of those like
[25:05.320 --> 25:07.320]  Things are different without Steve Jobs
[25:07.440 --> 25:08.120]  Like yeah
[25:08.120 --> 25:10.280]  I've said to people on Twitter Steve Jobs was
[25:10.620 --> 25:17.680]  Impetuous and I know for a fact that the FaceTime team found out that they were gonna take it to open standards bodies
[25:18.760 --> 25:20.760]  Exactly when we did when it was announced
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.320]  Like that. Well, that's brutal. That was something that Steve Jobs decided during rehearsals
[25:26.640 --> 25:30.360]  The week prior to the announcement. He was like why not?
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.440]  You know, let's do this and didn't talk to the lawyers didn't talk to the team
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.120]  so the source code nothing was written with the idea that it would be an open standard and
[25:40.240 --> 25:47.720]  That I know and then this I don't know but it's I'm pretty sure having talked to people over the years about it that
[25:48.400 --> 25:50.000]  They've had a lot of
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.400]  lawsuits regarding
[25:51.400 --> 25:54.080]  You know patent related lawsuits regarding FaceTime
[25:54.960 --> 26:00.640]  and at least one of them made them change the protocol at some point and
[26:01.640 --> 26:05.480]  Because they're what I think it actually related to a time when FaceTime got flakier
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.640]  Like they had to do so they had to make some changes and it actually made it worse. Oh
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.000]  Yes, I remember that it was their routing protocol or something
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.400]  Yeah, it was the way that they handed off from like a phone call from a cellular network to the data network or something
[26:19.400 --> 26:24.280]  Yeah, it was I don't know the details. I don't think are as interesting as just the basic story though
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.080]  Which is that patent litigation forced them to change the protocol so they couldn't have even gotten you know
[26:29.240 --> 26:31.980]  They couldn't even keep the protocol that they shipped with
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.280]  themselves let alone make it an open standard and and there are so it's
[26:37.580 --> 26:43.900]  The whole area is so patent encumbered that it just that it's more or less why they've given up on it
[26:43.900 --> 26:51.200]  I mean, who knows maybe someday they will submit it, you know, they'll have it in shape to do but in terms of it's been
[26:51.200 --> 26:53.480]  You know four or five years and it hasn't happened
[26:53.480 --> 27:01.200]  It's because when they and when Steve Jobs announced it it just was not a vetted vetted by engineering or vetted by legal declaration
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.920]  It was job saying we're gonna make it, you know an open
[27:04.540 --> 27:08.040]  Standard and can have right Tim Cook is not that type of CEO
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.680]  like if they say they're going to open source health or
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.080]  Not health kit, but research kit. They're gonna open source it and
[27:16.880 --> 27:24.000]  I would guess that the research kit team knew that plan all along and you know has been right
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.160]  I I don't know. I don't know anybody. I have no sources on the research kit team
[27:28.160 --> 27:34.120]  So I you know, there could be people in Cupertino listening to this podcast going. Oh god, you're so wrong. We're fucked. I don't know
[27:34.920 --> 27:41.600]  We found out same time you did but my guess is though that they knew this all along and that they've written it because it
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.340]  Is true. This is very true. It is really hard to open source
[27:46.160 --> 27:53.120]  Any significant code base that was not intended to be open source from the get-go. It's just I talked to any programmer
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.120]  It's it's just axiomatic. Yeah, and I'm not a programmer
[27:57.120 --> 28:02.600]  So this is this is essentially because it's interwoven with stuff that you don't want to open source, right?
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.200]  Yeah, and you know, it's almost like designing a space like a building like if you you know a space
[28:08.200 --> 28:13.360]  That's meant for the public to come in is different than a space that you is not meant for the public to come in just
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.200]  You know in terms of where you put the doors where you put locks what's you know bolted down?
[28:19.120 --> 28:22.840]  And yeah, and like what libraries you use what dependencies you have?
[28:23.280 --> 28:28.380]  You know, it's yeah, so my guess is that this will be open source right on schedule with no hitches
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.520]  Yeah
[28:30.520 --> 28:32.920]  Well the schedule thing it would be interesting
[28:32.920 --> 28:37.440]  But yeah, I don't think it'll be a year's delay or or nobody's ever gonna talk about it again like FaceTime
[28:37.440 --> 28:38.960]  It's it doesn't make sense
[28:38.960 --> 28:44.520]  I mean what they're trying to do only actually makes sense if other people have access to it
[28:44.520 --> 28:49.240]  I mean not what they're trying to do, but the spirit in which they're trying to do it, right?
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.440]  so if they're trying to say we are genuinely interested in improving the quality and
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.620]  quantity of research in this arena
[28:57.760 --> 29:04.000]  Then the only way to really honor that is to say it's not just iPhone users, you know
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.920]  We're gonna open source it so anybody can access this framework and and do these things
[29:07.920 --> 29:11.880]  It's just work. We need we felt we needed to do and Cook said something
[29:13.000 --> 29:19.280]  Essentially reiterating his I'm we don't pay attention to the ROI statements at the recent shareholders meeting
[29:19.280 --> 29:22.800]  He said something about research kid and and some other efforts
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.880]  They did as far as like diversity stuff and say it's I think it is genuinely a thing
[29:28.080 --> 29:30.120]  Sure, it's good PR for them, right?
[29:30.120 --> 29:34.760]  Obviously, but it it also is something I think that where they saw an opportunity
[29:34.960 --> 29:40.640]  That they could execute on this because they were already doing stuff in that space and it would benefit them for sure
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.600]  But it would also benefit, you know the public at large and why not, you know
[29:44.600 --> 29:51.920]  And at this point they have the resources and money to spend on these things and it just seems like cook is more willing to say
[29:52.640 --> 29:58.920]  Okay, you you people do this you take this chunk of resources and do this. Yeah, I agree
[29:58.920 --> 30:04.200]  I you know, I think that it doesn't mean you have to be any less cynical about Apple as a for-profit
[30:04.880 --> 30:09.320]  Corporation but that it's true some of the stuff they do is not about the ROI
[30:09.320 --> 30:12.860]  I know that I didn't see anything about the shareholders meeting yesterday
[30:12.860 --> 30:19.800]  but I know he'd repeated that again a week or two ago when he was in Europe and I think it was when he was
[30:19.800 --> 30:25.480]  in London and and somebody you know, he took questions from store employees and there was press there and that somebody asked about
[30:25.480 --> 30:32.480]  Accessibility and whether the watcher is gonna be accessible and he just said it will be and that they take it seriously
[30:32.480 --> 30:39.840]  And it's just one of those things where they don't measure the ROI. They don't measure whether they sell enough iPhones to
[30:41.020 --> 30:48.700]  Vision impaired people to justify the cost of the engineering of making everything accessible to they don't even measure it because it's just the
[30:48.700 --> 30:52.080]  Right thing to do and clearly they can do it and still be very profitable
[30:52.080 --> 30:58.160]  It's just the right thing to do and I believe that I truly believe that they don't measure the ROI on stuff like that
[30:59.480 --> 31:03.700]  Yeah, and and he said that this at this shareholders meeting
[31:03.700 --> 31:07.240]  I guess he said Apple didn't do this for the ROI in reference to research kit
[31:07.240 --> 31:10.440]  this just isn't the lens Apple uses that was the
[31:11.320 --> 31:16.200]  The phrase that he used and of course we got as a as a news organization
[31:16.200 --> 31:21.760]  We get you know pitches from from everybody immediately after following this and so we get pitches from these people
[31:21.760 --> 31:25.000]  Oh that are either shareholder interest people or
[31:25.720 --> 31:27.960]  conservative organizations or you know
[31:28.520 --> 31:31.680]  Capitalist advocates and stuff we get all these pitches immediately afterwards
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.680]  And so they're like, oh we were very disappointed with Tim Cook denigrating capitalism and you know all this
[31:37.680 --> 31:42.540]  It's actually pretty amazing how vociferous people get when he says I mean, it's a small statement
[31:42.680 --> 31:48.240]  but it is very tricky to say that and and very tricky to say it about the right things because
[31:48.240 --> 31:52.720]  His job is to maximize investor return as an overall CEO
[31:53.040 --> 31:57.400]  So it's it's a powerful statement more powerful than I think people give it credit for I
[31:58.360 --> 32:00.000]  would actually
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  that's actually a
[32:03.120 --> 32:04.640]  Like
[32:04.640 --> 32:09.800]  80s going forward thing and it's actually not the job of the CEO
[32:09.840 --> 32:14.200]  there is like it's people say that it's it's become like part of the
[32:14.200 --> 32:16.200]  It
[32:16.520 --> 32:18.520]  There's a lot of people who
[32:18.720 --> 32:23.700]  Put it in those terms that the job of the CEO is to maximize investor returns and it's actually not true
[32:23.700 --> 32:29.440]  You can't there is no legal definition that says that it's the CEO does answer to the shareholders and the shareholders do have a reasonable
[32:29.560 --> 32:33.760]  Expectation that they're that the company will be managed in a way that you know
[32:34.560 --> 32:36.560]  Doesn't devalue the company
[32:36.560 --> 32:44.280]  But that is it's sort of 80s going forward justification for for the sort of logic that leads
[32:44.280 --> 32:46.520]  To the quarter by quarter, you know
[32:47.160 --> 32:52.720]  To do whatever it takes that's actually traditionally is not really the the view of the CEO
[32:52.720 --> 32:58.520]  And I think Cook definitely has that old-school like he's thinking every bit as much about where Apple's gonna be in
[32:58.880 --> 33:01.960]  2530 years as he is where they're gonna be next quarter and
[33:01.960 --> 33:06.760]  And but anyway long story short though. I think nobody the thing that's different about Apple
[33:06.760 --> 33:12.440]  Is there and and again, you can be completely cynical about their their ruthless capitalism
[33:12.440 --> 33:18.000]  Is there profit margins across the board but by focusing and maintaining these?
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.120]  unprecedented
[33:21.160 --> 33:22.120]  30-35
[33:22.120 --> 33:24.480]  36 37 percent profit margins on
[33:25.760 --> 33:30.280]  With with average selling prices that are way above the competition
[33:30.280 --> 33:36.600]  so they have higher margins and higher selling average selling prices for phones for laptops for desktops for
[33:36.760 --> 33:39.480]  Definitely for the watches and definitely for watches
[33:41.040 --> 33:47.560]  That's what allows them to do things on their periphery that may not have an ROI, you know, right
[33:48.600 --> 33:50.600]  You know, it's it
[33:50.760 --> 33:55.240]  by focusing on and keeping these high profit margins and overall and
[33:55.240 --> 34:00.120]  Incredible amounts of profit. They don't have to do, you know sweat the details on stuff like that
[34:00.120 --> 34:07.120]  Like I don't think that they're reckless with their money at all. If anything, I think that they're still relatively conservative
[34:07.120 --> 34:15.480]  Maybe even too conservative, you know with their spending but that's that's how you become so insanely profitable is by being conservative with your spending
[34:16.180 --> 34:22.720]  What was it last year? I thought I thought and and you know, I don't mean I thought Tim Cook's too big
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.700]  Move moments last year were when he his essay in Businessweek where he came out as gay
[34:28.700 --> 34:34.080]  which was I thought very eloquent and just perfectly timed and absolutely and his
[34:35.200 --> 34:37.160]  downright angry
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.360]  response at last year's shareholder meeting again, we're talking about return on investment with
[34:43.080 --> 34:49.400]  the the conservative guy who was upset about their stance on global warming and that they're
[34:49.400 --> 34:55.880]  You know spending billions of dollars on solar power for their data centers
[34:55.880 --> 35:00.880]  And now they've announced a new thing where they're spending billions of dollars on solar power to power the campus
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.840]  You know, and he was upset about that. Like why are you wasting? How can you justify wasting shareholder money on on?
[35:07.520 --> 35:11.960]  You know this theory that you know that the and cook this cut
[35:11.960 --> 35:19.400]  He got angry. Oh, no, he did. Yeah, that was that's the only time I thought that you've ever seen in public
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.040]  You've ever seen Tim Cook off message ever and not that he I don't think he regrets it at all
[35:24.040 --> 35:26.040]  But he really he got angry
[35:26.680 --> 35:28.160]  kind of scary
[35:28.160 --> 35:31.760]  Yeah. Yeah, I know I can I can't even imagine now
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.720]  Because he's such a calm collected guy. It's so different when somebody's bombastic you kind of expect it from them
[35:37.720 --> 35:44.960]  but I think it was definitely a departure from the script and a departure from his his demeanor cracked a little bit and not necessarily in
[35:44.960 --> 35:47.520]  A bad way, but just in a you know, very human way, you know
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.900]  He felt very passionately about about that subject and I think that there's the cynicism as you mentioned
[35:53.900 --> 35:58.280]  It's good as a journalist. It's helpful to have cynicism a general overall
[35:59.280 --> 36:01.760]  Skepticism, but I think that the cynicism
[36:01.760 --> 36:09.240]  Towards technology and larger companies like Apple, especially because of the the enormous amounts of power that they wield
[36:09.840 --> 36:13.600]  It has to be balanced, right? And I think that this
[36:14.120 --> 36:21.040]  These kinds of subjects where you're talking about a company like Apple saying we're gonna do this regardless of return. There's a lot of
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.240]  Instinctual desire to paint that as a PR move or something like that and I I don't I don't hang out with Tim Cook
[36:29.240 --> 36:35.600]  We don't play golf. I don't know but it just doesn't feel it feels organic. It doesn't feel manufactured to me at all
[36:35.600 --> 36:37.600]  Yeah, I agree. I thought
[36:38.440 --> 36:43.840]  with the sweater with the zip-up sweater that he had on he the word that came to mind was
[36:44.920 --> 36:46.920]  avuncular
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.580]  Right, he seems like he's sort of the company's uncle, you know that everybody looks up to and you know
[36:52.580 --> 36:57.640]  He's he's not their executive team is pretty much around the same age
[36:57.640 --> 37:04.000]  Everybody is sort of like 50 to 55. It's not like he is older but his hair is a little grayer than than most
[37:04.920 --> 37:07.920]  and so it does he sort of has like
[37:09.240 --> 37:13.040]  Elder statesman makes him seem old. It's not old but there's sort of like I
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.760]  Don't know and a sweater just sort of emphasized it. He's like the the uncle that everybody looks up to
[37:19.640 --> 37:21.960]  mm-hmm, I think there's a
[37:22.960 --> 37:24.200]  power
[37:24.200 --> 37:28.560]  For him in feeling like he's collected, you know
[37:28.560 --> 37:35.500]  like he has he's comfortable in the the power in the role that he's in because I think a lot of times you see these CEOs
[37:35.500 --> 37:38.920]  Who obviously you and I both know over the past decade. Everybody has tried to
[37:39.920 --> 37:47.920]  Replicate apples sort of we're actually gonna bring the company man out on stage and he's gonna be convincing and they almost always fail
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.320]  but you see a lot of these guys come out and it feels very much like you
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.840]  Know I got coached for for four weeks to deliver the speech and I'm delivering it
[37:59.840 --> 38:01.160]  But you don't really believe any of that
[38:01.160 --> 38:07.860]  But he's feeling more and more comfortable with the power that he wields and it seems like it's it's one of those things where?
[38:08.240 --> 38:13.220]  He comes out. He said he's in control. He has this presence where
[38:13.220 --> 38:17.940]  You believe that he actually does have a handle on what's going on?
[38:17.940 --> 38:21.960]  And Steve had that in a different way where you felt that the things he was saying
[38:22.380 --> 38:27.600]  Reflected his passions and his passions drove the company. Whereas it seems like the things that cook is saying
[38:28.220 --> 38:33.540]  Reflect the the passions of the people inside the company. Yeah, so it just seems like a little bit of a different balance there
[38:33.540 --> 38:35.540]  I think the single most
[38:36.220 --> 38:38.220]  important aspect of Tim Cook's
[38:38.220 --> 38:45.240]  Leadership as CEO and his person that that what made him so suited to take over when he did
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.660]  Is that he truly seems?
[38:49.020 --> 38:50.820]  completely secure
[38:50.820 --> 38:56.180]  with the fact that he is in no way Steve Jobs, and I
[38:56.860 --> 38:58.380]  I think
[38:58.380 --> 39:06.100]  It's almost incredible. Like he's nowhere near he's very good. He's very smart. He's doing a great job. The company is incredibly
[39:06.100 --> 39:07.700]  successful
[39:07.700 --> 39:12.540]  So far under his leadership, but nobody is ever going to doubt nobody
[39:12.540 --> 39:17.060]  I don't think I mean, I think you know the way things will play out like in the history of the industry
[39:17.060 --> 39:21.500]  He will not be as famous or revered or as you know
[39:21.500 --> 39:28.020]  Looked back upon a hundred years from now as Steve Jobs, right? Steve Jobs is Thomas Edison, you know, he's Henry Ford
[39:28.020 --> 39:32.600]  He's you know, we're gonna be talking about him for long after you know, we're dead
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.880]  And he is totally secure in that. He doesn't bother him one bit. He
[39:38.400 --> 39:44.120]  Understands it. He knows it and he's fine with it. It doesn't bother him at all. There's no part of his
[39:44.720 --> 39:48.720]  Ego that is bothered by that and I think that is extraordinary
[39:49.360 --> 39:51.080]  And I think it's a true
[39:51.080 --> 39:55.900]  It's just remarkable because I think that oh, you know almost anybody else who would have taken over
[39:55.900 --> 40:01.000]  It would have been inevitable that they'd it would it would eat at them. Yep. Yep. I agree
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.240]  It takes a lot. It takes a lot of comfort to not
[40:05.760 --> 40:12.640]  Put that it wasn't even that other people because other people are gonna compare and do compare Tim to Steve as far as management
[40:12.640 --> 40:15.680]  Style or success or whatever, but to not put that on yourself
[40:15.720 --> 40:20.200]  I mean, that's an insane thing and I'm sure you know, he thinks about it a lot
[40:20.200 --> 40:21.800]  But it doesn't seem like he lets it get in his way
[40:21.800 --> 40:25.440]  you know in some other universe where Steve either didn't get sick or or
[40:25.440 --> 40:31.280]  Be beat it and stayed ahead of it and had you know a full career and stayed at you know
[40:31.280 --> 40:34.080]  At the helm as CEO until he was, you know, 70 years old
[40:34.720 --> 40:40.560]  And it was a planned and obvious transition and there was no tragedy involved
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.360]  There still would have had to been as somebody who followed Steve Jobs and it would have been hard
[40:45.520 --> 40:52.640]  But it's so much harder to do it like Tim Cook did in a way where everybody Cook
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.520]  Included wishes it had hadn't hadn't had to happen
[40:57.320 --> 41:03.200]  Right. Yeah, it's just and I you know, it's been you know, what three years
[41:03.960 --> 41:08.040]  Yeah, it's been like three and three years three and almost, you know coming up on three and a half years
[41:10.840 --> 41:16.280]  It's you know, it clearly feels like it's in the past tense that you know when Steve was around it feels you know
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.680]  it's like this is Tim's Apple, but I still feel like we we underestimate just
[41:20.680 --> 41:23.980]  What an extraordinary position that thrust him into?
[41:25.060 --> 41:27.420]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, and and the
[41:29.020 --> 41:33.580]  There in most transitions like this there's a situation where you have a
[41:34.480 --> 41:37.940]  clear-cut goal like oh we need to fix this or fix that and
[41:38.500 --> 41:44.580]  The hardest position to come into as an incoming CEO is to not screw up something that's already
[41:45.180 --> 41:48.380]  Incredibly successful, right? Exactly. Like that's the worst one, right?
[41:48.380 --> 41:51.500]  You know, there's all kinds of other scenarios, but that's the oh man. That's the worst
[41:52.180 --> 41:57.940]  Because you're the only thing you could do and if you are you are the best thing your best person at your job ever
[41:58.340 --> 42:00.940]  You're just gonna get good people going. Okay, good. You didn't screw it up
[42:00.940 --> 42:06.340]  And if you're the worst, I mean this if you you know screw up even a little bit and things go downwards
[42:06.340 --> 42:10.900]  Then it's you know, then you're the worst you're awful and you're horrible and everybody blames you
[42:10.980 --> 42:15.420]  So it's just the thing it was a thankless thing and I think he's handled it pretty well. Yeah
[42:15.420 --> 42:18.140]  I'm not saying I will do another break but
[42:19.260 --> 42:23.720]  Jeff Williams first on stage appearance for research kit
[42:24.660 --> 42:26.820]  Well is I should say I reword it
[42:26.820 --> 42:31.060]  It was his first on stage appearance at a keynote and it was for research kit
[42:31.580 --> 42:36.140]  I think that's noteworthy. I think that there is a sort of
[42:36.780 --> 42:38.780]  implicit
[42:38.780 --> 42:46.540]  You know, there's a whole page of what a dozen dozen plus senior executives at Apple that they listed as their senior leadership
[42:46.540 --> 42:53.500]  But the ones who speak on stage, I think there's an implicit, you know, they're the a-team Schiller Federighi
[42:55.260 --> 42:58.820]  Johnny I've is an exception but he does, you know, he does all these videos
[42:59.900 --> 43:06.460]  And I think Jeff Williams getting elevated to that level is a sign that he's leveled up within the company
[43:06.460 --> 43:12.860]  Yeah, there's a sort of line on the page and I don't want to read too much into the page layout
[43:13.060 --> 43:17.280]  Well, there's a sort of line and below it is Paul Deneve and Lisa Jackson and you know
[43:17.280 --> 43:24.140]  Joe Padolini and then above that Jeff Williams is the last person above that. No, but the above that it's a
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.620]  order
[43:25.620 --> 43:31.360]  Right, right exactly. And I think that he's definitely part of that group. Obviously the people like Luca
[43:31.820 --> 43:35.140]  Won't be on the stage necessarily because that's just not Apple's thing
[43:35.140 --> 43:38.980]  You know, somebody like Dan I could see making an appearance maybe at some point
[43:40.180 --> 43:43.060]  Johnny obviously chooses not to as far as I've heard
[43:44.020 --> 43:47.300]  You know Bruce is GC so he's not really that's not his thing
[43:47.300 --> 43:53.340]  But amongst that other group, the only person that hasn't been on there that I think will eventually would be Angela, right?
[43:53.340 --> 43:53.740]  Yeah
[43:53.740 --> 43:59.460]  So I think that Jeff being in that group of people that presents is important and I also thought that
[44:00.100 --> 44:02.660]  Kevin Lynch coming out and he did actually a really good job
[44:02.660 --> 44:03.300]  Well, we'll talk about that
[44:03.300 --> 44:08.700]  Wasn't yeah, I thought so too. Yeah sure. Um, but yeah, I brought Bruce Sewell as the general counsel
[44:08.700 --> 44:11.940]  I think if anybody went to him as as the lawyer and said like hey
[44:11.940 --> 44:14.700]  We want you to come out on stage and speak publicly. He'd be like, fuck you
[44:15.700 --> 44:21.060]  Yeah, I would advise you not to yeah, you just know that that guy is a stone-cold killer. He's
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.900]  a scary guy, you know, I
[44:25.100 --> 44:27.100]  think that I
[44:27.100 --> 44:32.100]  As a you know spitball I predicted that maybe Angela aren'ts would appear on stage
[44:32.100 --> 44:36.100]  And then a lot of people wrote to me afterwards like, oh, what do you think that she didn't know I own it
[44:36.100 --> 44:42.700]  But I think it's simple because they didn't have they didn't it was it my theory that maybe she would was tied to the idea
[44:42.700 --> 44:47.700]  That they would talk about these the store retail changes that are coming
[44:49.500 --> 44:51.500]  All they have was a table with a glass top
[44:51.500 --> 44:55.700]  Yeah, she's gonna go on there and introduce a table with a glass top. Yeah, I know. So yeah, I agree
[44:55.700 --> 44:59.100]  I think she would have been if they had some I think she will eventually
[44:59.100 --> 45:03.300]  But I think that it would be in the context of retail
[45:03.900 --> 45:08.500]  It's you know, it's no hurt. There's too many people who I think are reading into
[45:09.100 --> 45:13.100]  her background and the fact that they're getting into watches and think that she's
[45:13.700 --> 45:18.100]  Doing product marketing or product development on watch and stuff like that
[45:18.100 --> 45:22.900]  Like no her job is to head retail and trust me her hands are full like that's more than enough work
[45:23.300 --> 45:26.700]  For her to do so if she were to come on stage
[45:26.700 --> 45:32.500]  It would be to talk about retail it would not be to you know, talk about watch features or something like that
[45:33.100 --> 45:39.300]  Yeah, when I when she got hired I did I finally published a piece that I've been like working out for months about it
[45:39.300 --> 45:43.500]  just before the event and then nobody promptly nobody read it because of the event obviously, but
[45:44.900 --> 45:49.300]  When she got hired I kind of asked around and you know at Apple a little bit just people I knew and said so what?
[45:49.700 --> 45:54.300]  You know you she can be involved in the watch because that's what a lot of people as you said a lot of people were assuming
[45:54.300 --> 46:00.300]  Oh, she's they're not just hiring her for retail. They're hiring her to help develop the watch or you know work on that
[46:00.300 --> 46:02.300]  That aspect of it and they said don't
[46:03.300 --> 46:04.300]  overestimate
[46:04.300 --> 46:06.300]  the amount of
[46:07.300 --> 46:13.300]  Involvement that that retail would have in product development, you know, she's not sending in on on product
[46:14.300 --> 46:16.300]  Feature roundtables right, you know necessarily
[46:17.300 --> 46:19.300]  And I'm I know I don't know this for sure. Obviously
[46:19.300 --> 46:25.300]  This is just people giving me general kind of hints of about how Apple works. So I just yeah, she's not
[46:25.300 --> 46:29.300]  She's in definitely involved in the retail side of things which I think there's plenty of work to do there
[46:29.300 --> 46:34.300]  Yeah, I say this not to be dismissive as to her skills and abilities and taste
[46:34.300 --> 46:39.300]  I say this only knowing that be in charge of retail for the
[46:39.800 --> 46:44.300]  most profitable per square foot retailer in the world who is
[46:44.300 --> 46:51.300]  Expanding at a very consistent not you know, not overly aggressive not reckless but expanding and
[46:52.300 --> 46:56.300]  Expanding in places as politically delicate as China. It's
[46:57.300 --> 46:59.300]  More than enough work. It's a ton of work
[46:59.300 --> 47:03.300]  I'm sure that she is working her ass off every day and that just on the retail alone
[47:03.300 --> 47:07.300]  But I think that you know when if and when we see her on stage, it'll be in that context
[47:09.300 --> 47:11.300]  All right, let me take another break here and
[47:11.300 --> 47:18.300]  Thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at Harry's Harry's makes premium
[47:19.300 --> 47:23.300]  Men's shaving goods they make razors they make blades
[47:24.300 --> 47:26.300]  They make shaving cream and gel they have aftershave
[47:27.300 --> 47:30.300]  everything you need to take care of your shaving needs and
[47:31.300 --> 47:36.300]  They do it right. It's top quality stuff and at a great price
[47:36.300 --> 47:41.300]  Really truly go to Amazon measure it against the stuff from Gillette about half the price
[47:42.300 --> 47:46.300]  Of the major big brand competitors for blades. How do they do it?
[47:46.300 --> 47:52.300]  Well, they do it by cutting out the middleman cutting out the advertising and by taking control themselves
[47:54.300 --> 48:00.300]  They bought their own factory in Germany that makes razor blades a factory that was already doing it. They bought it
[48:00.300 --> 48:05.300]  They make their own blades. They are top-notch super sharp really high quality
[48:06.300 --> 48:11.300]  They're not just like a company that has a cool brand and they white label the blades from you know
[48:11.300 --> 48:17.300]  Whatever factory anywhere in the world. No, they make their own blades really great stuff. They make their own handles
[48:17.300 --> 48:19.300]  They're really great design. It doesn't look like the the
[48:20.300 --> 48:26.300]  Lingy crap that you get from Gillette or Schick or those guys stuff that looks like you buy it now
[48:26.300 --> 48:32.300]  And 30 40 years from now it's gonna look exactly the same when you buy another one from Harry's because it's just a simple plain
[48:32.300 --> 48:34.300]  timeless classy design
[48:34.300 --> 48:40.300]  And all the details are right you pick up the handle. It just feels good in your hand. It's like a nice solid
[48:41.300 --> 48:48.300]  Just a nice solid thing really almost Apple like in terms of just caring about how something feels like the heft of it
[48:49.300 --> 48:51.300]  And really really great prices
[48:51.300 --> 48:58.300]  Where do you go to find out more go to harry's.com h a r r y s.com
[48:59.300 --> 49:01.300]  and
[49:01.300 --> 49:03.300]  When you buy something
[49:03.300 --> 49:09.300]  Use this code talk show they don't put the done. That's just talk show use that code and you'll save
[49:09.300 --> 49:11.300]  I think five bucks off your first order
[49:11.300 --> 49:15.300]  you'll save something if you've never bought anything from Harry's before use that code and
[49:15.300 --> 49:21.300]  You'll save a couple bucks and the starter kit is only like 15 bucks so you can get started with that code
[49:21.300 --> 49:24.300]  You get started for like 10 bucks. You'll get a handle three blades
[49:25.300 --> 49:27.300]  Really nice packaging
[49:27.300 --> 49:31.300]  Really you're you're I hate to say it but you're stupid if you don't take them up on it
[49:31.300 --> 49:35.300]  It's a great deal. So my thanks to Harry's I actually use their stuff. It's great, right?
[49:36.300 --> 49:37.300]  Yeah, it's pretty solid
[49:37.300 --> 49:39.300]  I mean I I tried it on kind of a
[49:39.300 --> 49:45.300]  Whim I first heard about them and I've been using them ever since it took me a while they used the angle of the blades
[49:45.300 --> 49:49.300]  It's like really flat in comparison to like a Gillette turbo or whatever
[49:49.300 --> 49:52.300]  You know with the 18 blades on it that strips your skin from your flesh
[49:52.300 --> 49:56.300]  Yeah, I think I know what you mean. I do know what you mean where it is sort of more of a
[49:57.300 --> 50:00.300]  Yeah, it's like a yeah like a flat. Yeah flat a good way to put it. Mm-hmm
[50:01.300 --> 50:04.300]  But yeah works well. Yeah, really great stuff back to the
[50:04.300 --> 50:10.300]  Event so after Jeff Williams and research kit
[50:10.300 --> 50:14.300]  It was the new MacBook and at this point to me
[50:15.300 --> 50:20.300]  To me, it's almost like it was like two events because this to me was just pure Apple
[50:20.300 --> 50:26.300]  Right, and it's like and Schiller does this stuff. Great. I know there's some people who think that he is. I
[50:27.300 --> 50:30.300]  don't know what people say so people some people think he's a little like
[50:30.300 --> 50:33.300]  Not flat, but that he's he's like unenthusiastic
[50:34.300 --> 50:39.300]  On stage. I think that he's got the I think he's got this stuff down so cold. He's so good
[50:39.300 --> 50:43.300]  I think he's their best presenter by far and he does it
[50:43.300 --> 50:50.300]  Yeah, he he just knows how to do it. And it's just it was just such a typical Apple product introduction. I
[50:51.300 --> 50:54.300]  Thought it was really and I think he understands the stuff right? Yeah
[50:54.300 --> 51:00.300]  so I think that's the difference between like a presenter and somebody who goes out there and and
[51:00.300 --> 51:04.300]  Happens to present this thing that they've been working on and obviously he doesn't do hardware he's marketing
[51:04.300 --> 51:07.300]  But still he just get he understands holistically
[51:07.300 --> 51:13.300]  What makes it special and he's trying to he's trying to really just tell you why that's the field that you get
[51:13.300 --> 51:17.300]  I think when he goes high, but I think it's genuine and I've said before like
[51:17.300 --> 51:20.300]  That's how product marketing works it out
[51:20.300 --> 51:26.300]  Well, like it's not like somebody like Johnny Ives team comes up with the design and they work out the engineering and then they make
[51:26.300 --> 51:29.300]  It and then they come to Schiller's team and say here
[51:29.300 --> 51:35.300]  Here's the new MacBook figure out a way to sell it like Schiller and his team are involved right from the get-go
[51:35.300 --> 51:39.300]  in terms of the product development like they're involved at the
[51:40.300 --> 51:44.300]  Beginning like it's it's not here's the thing figure out a way to sell it
[51:44.300 --> 51:50.300]  It's what should the thing be and then all we have to do is tell people what it is and why like I said and why
[51:51.300 --> 51:53.300]  right and and I
[51:53.300 --> 51:59.300]  Mean that that's it's typified by this section where they spent like three four minutes talking about keyboard switches, right?
[51:59.300 --> 52:02.300]  Yeah, like you tell any other marketing head
[52:02.300 --> 52:02.300]  Hey
[52:02.300 --> 52:08.300]  We change the keyboards which is in this it took us like two years to research it and and build these or however long and
[52:08.300 --> 52:11.300]  Research and build these keyboard switches. They're like, okay, let's do this
[52:11.300 --> 52:16.300]  I'll see if I can sneak it in, you know, but no he knows why he knows the amount of effort
[52:16.300 --> 52:22.300]  they spent on it and he knows why it's so important and he also knows that when Apple announces something like this it actually
[52:23.300 --> 52:27.300]  He has to impress upon people that they really really thought about it
[52:27.300 --> 52:31.300]  They mean there's no other way just to say we really thought hard about it
[52:31.300 --> 52:37.300]  They made like a Hollywood caliber slow slow-mo video showing how the keys work in action
[52:37.300 --> 52:42.300]  It's yeah, I'm I guarantee you they shot that with a phantom right with one of those
[52:42.300 --> 52:48.300]  Yeah, 20,000 frames per second. Yeah, you know cameras. Yeah, I definitely think they might have
[52:51.300 --> 52:54.300]  What do you think about the MacBook, I mean overall impressions is pretty good
[52:54.300 --> 52:57.300]  You know, I've been I dinked around with it at the event a little bit afterwards
[52:57.300 --> 53:00.300]  But I think that on stage when I was watching it
[53:00.300 --> 53:07.300]  I started mentally tallying the amount of major inventions that went into the one device
[53:07.300 --> 53:13.300]  Because usually with Apple there will be a lot of refinements and a lot of iterative changes that they make to something
[53:13.300 --> 53:18.300]  And of course each one of those involves experimentation maybe invention and that kind of thing
[53:18.300 --> 53:24.300]  But the MacBook especially this time around there were there were like five major inventions
[53:24.300 --> 53:31.300]  That you know things that had to be created not just bought and are licensed and applied
[53:31.300 --> 53:35.300]  But actually created to make this thing work. Well, let's you know, listen, okay
[53:35.300 --> 53:39.300]  Okay, so you've got the batteries right a change in batteries
[53:39.300 --> 53:43.300]  They'll just do an overview. So change your batteries touch pad
[53:43.300 --> 53:46.300]  the screen
[53:46.300 --> 53:50.300]  Right, which is a change in the screen the keyboard switches
[53:50.300 --> 53:56.300]  And then the well, I guess USB C is really under adoption right because they're adopting a standard
[53:56.300 --> 54:01.300]  Well, here's the thing about that though. I have heard I can't you know
[54:01.300 --> 54:07.300]  Can't say who but let's call them informed little birdies that USB C is an Apple invention
[54:07.300 --> 54:11.300]  And that they gave it to the standard bodies
[54:11.300 --> 54:16.300]  And that wouldn't surprise me too much that the politics of such is that
[54:16.300 --> 54:22.300]  They can't really say that they they're not going to come out in public and say that but that they did
[54:22.300 --> 54:28.300]  It is an apple. Yeah, and they do they want it to become a standard, you know, that's like the difference like
[54:28.300 --> 54:30.300]  And you know we can get into this. It's a good question
[54:30.300 --> 54:36.300]  We should definitely come back to is are they going to use USB C instead of lightning on iOS devices or something?
[54:36.300 --> 54:42.300]  But I feel like the difference is there are certain devices and context where they want to have
[54:42.300 --> 54:49.300]  A proprietary port and there are other contexts where they want to have an industry standard port
[54:49.300 --> 54:54.300]  You know, they want your MacBook to be able to connect to third-party displays
[54:54.300 --> 54:56.300]  Sure, they want you to buy an Apple display
[54:56.300 --> 55:01.300]  But they know that you know that it that it has to be able to support third-party displays
[55:01.300 --> 55:08.300]  They want you to be able to plug in a microphone, you know for podcasting into your MacBook
[55:08.300 --> 55:13.300]  And they're not going to make microphones, right? So they want it to be an open port
[55:13.300 --> 55:20.300]  and so, you know, but they also want it to be obviously thin and they also want it to be
[55:20.300 --> 55:24.300]  Upside down a bowl. I don't know what you would call. Yeah reversible. I guess
[55:24.300 --> 55:28.300]  Yeah, and so they you know, what I've heard is that it's pretty you know
[55:28.300 --> 55:31.300]  It's an Apple invention that was sort of developed coincident
[55:31.300 --> 55:35.300]  You know alongside lightning and that they donated they gave to the state government
[55:35.300 --> 55:39.300]  You know alongside lightning and that they donated they gave to the standards bodies
[55:39.300 --> 55:42.300]  So because they wanted to you know, they want just they want the open
[55:42.300 --> 55:48.300]  They want the industry standard to be thin enough for their devices and they want it to be reversible
[55:48.300 --> 55:53.300]  Right. I mean that makes some sense. I mean the the one thing that I
[55:53.300 --> 55:58.300]  That made me sad about it is the apparent death of mag safe, right? Yeah
[55:58.300 --> 56:02.300]  As I had I'm not going to take credit for this a former app alert told me this
[56:02.300 --> 56:08.300]  But he said that he felt that the mag safe was like the the hallmark Apple invention of the 2000s
[56:08.300 --> 56:14.300]  Yeah, you know and that it was a very Apple thing to do and that
[56:14.300 --> 56:20.300]  You know, I mean you think about the amount of time that they spent patenting that they patented it so hard
[56:20.300 --> 56:27.300]  So hardcore that people couldn't even make anything like it like everybody else's had to be pretty awful in comparison
[56:27.300 --> 56:32.300]  Yeah, and I think that there's a plus and a minus to that the minus is that I wish all computers had that
[56:32.300 --> 56:38.300]  But they couldn't because Apple patented it but the plus is that it worked really well in Apple computers, you know
[56:38.300 --> 56:43.300]  Which is what I primarily use it for like laptops and stuff, but I'm pretty sad to see that go. I'm gonna be honest
[56:43.300 --> 56:48.300]  I'm kind of nostalgic for the magic mag safe already. It's funny and we you know, we have to mention that
[56:49.300 --> 56:55.300]  The mark Gurman at nine-to-five Mac. What was it about six weeks ago when he came out with the you know?
[56:55.300 --> 56:57.300]  Here's the next MacBook Air
[56:58.300 --> 57:05.300]  And you know had they they'd commissioned an artist to do you know renderings based on what he was told
[57:05.300 --> 57:10.300]  And it was spot-on nailed it. Yeah, really really close. I mean there was a little the
[57:11.300 --> 57:16.300]  Little tiny details wrong, but I almost think it wasn't even I think it was just like a mistake on the artist part
[57:16.300 --> 57:21.300]  For example, the escape key was and the renderings was top right instead of top left
[57:21.300 --> 57:26.300]  which made no sense at all like why if if there's room for the key period why in the world would you move and
[57:27.300 --> 57:31.300]  I think it was just a mistake on the artist part. I don't think that like it was a botched part of this thing
[57:31.300 --> 57:37.300]  I think the artist just wasn't thinking and put the escape key up there who you know who cares but in terms of only having
[57:37.300 --> 57:44.300]  one USB C port on the left and a microphone port on the right and no other ports period that nailed it or
[57:45.300 --> 57:47.300]  not microphone headphone jack
[57:47.300 --> 57:53.300]  Yeah, it's a line in and out by the way, so it is if that is audit and audio in Jack as well as a headphone jack
[57:53.300 --> 57:54.300]  Oh interesting
[57:55.300 --> 57:59.300]  and in in reaction to that the the you know the the
[58:00.300 --> 58:05.300]  Conventional wisdom the general consensus was well, how can you do that? How can you get rid of mag safe?
[58:05.300 --> 58:07.300]  You can't get rid of mag safe mag safe is awesome
[58:08.300 --> 58:12.300]  And you know it doesn't make any so therefore this can't be true. This has to be a mistake
[58:12.300 --> 58:19.300]  I think you know a lot of times you just you have to realize like in the name of progress Apple's answer is you know?
[58:19.300 --> 58:21.300]  tough
[58:22.300 --> 58:28.300]  Because we spent we spent millions of dollars developing this and we're gonna kill it just because it's not necessary and it's always
[58:28.300 --> 58:31.300]  You know, it's it to me. It's a good sign
[58:32.300 --> 58:37.300]  That I don't want to buy this laptop. I mean, I mean to I'll just say flat out. I do not want this machine right now
[58:37.300 --> 58:43.300]  But I like it as a statement as to where things are going and I definitely can imagine buying a
[58:44.300 --> 58:48.300]  Laptop a new MacBook in its image and you know next time I buy one in a couple years
[58:49.300 --> 58:53.300]  But I'm reminded of every time Apple has dropped something like this, you know
[58:53.300 --> 58:58.300]  Like with the original iMac dropping everything except USB and people said well
[58:58.300 --> 59:03.300]  It's not gonna work with any of my existing peripherals. None of my peripherals will work
[59:03.300 --> 59:08.300]  None of my mice or keyboards or hard drives are going to work and the answer is tough, you know
[59:09.300 --> 59:15.300]  Drop the optical when they drop the optical drive with the first MacBook Air
[59:15.300 --> 59:21.300]  And I think that's the real comparison is to the first MacBook Air people like well, it's not gonna play any DVDs
[59:21.300 --> 59:25.300]  It's not how am I gonna install the OS OS updates come on?
[59:26.300 --> 59:30.300]  DVDs and the answer was tough, you know, we'll figure it out. Yeah
[59:30.300 --> 59:33.300]  Yeah, wolf here at some point it's I joked on Twitter
[59:33.300 --> 59:39.300]  That's like, you know, they're there the Apple outrages the outreach cycle is essentially Apple predicts the future
[59:40.300 --> 59:42.300]  Executes it's a little bit
[59:42.300 --> 59:44.300]  You could even use the phrase a little bit too early
[59:44.300 --> 59:49.300]  right or a little bit earlier than the rest of the industry is really what that means and then everybody gets pissed and then
[59:50.300 --> 59:55.300]  Eventually, it's the standard and I think that Jason Snell wrote a review of the original MacBook
[59:55.300 --> 01:00:05.300]  He linked it on Twitter today. I was talking with Steven Sinofsky on Twitter about the the whole original MacBook review that Jason wrote and Jason chimed in and he had referred to it
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.300]  I guess a couple weeks ago, but it was essentially the same thing
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:15.300]  It's like man, this is you know, a big change and it's it there's a lot of compromises and etc, etc
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.300]  And you know, it's all over again. It's the same concept
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:24.300]  And and yet here we are with our heirs going. Oh how I could ever live without my air. My air is just fine
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:30.300]  You know, so well, I remember too when Gurman's report first came out with this and most people are like well
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.300]  there's no way they're gonna drop mag safe because mag safe is awesome and useful and then there were others the people who
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.300]  Ends up were right who said well
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.300]  iPad doesn't have mag safe
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.300]  Mm-hmm
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:51.300]  Yeah, I don't I don't buy that though that that to me is a straw man because the iPad is not used anywhere near like an
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.300]  L laptop is used, you know, some people are we are already telling me
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.300]  You know, I I would have a really hard time buying this laptop because I have small children
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:06.300]  you know and they run by my desk and kick the kick the wire and everything and I totally I agree with that and not only that
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.300]  Remember this thing is light. It's super light
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:14.300]  So if you kick that cord and there's any resistance it's gonna go flying and yeah, there's no moving parts anymore
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.300]  so theoretically speaking
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.300]  It's gonna be better off than a hard drive
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:24.300]  but still that's that kind of sucks and I wish that they would have found a way to maybe integrate mag safe into
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.300]  Their USB C. In other words, there's a general USB C
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.300]  You can plug a USB C cable into this without the mag safe, but ours has this really cool
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:39.300]  You know polarized magnet that auto centers and clicks in. Yeah, my thought was maybe they would put it on the adapter
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.300]  You know that the wall, you know the thing you plug in. Oh, yeah
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.300]  They just they didn't you know, it's not it is
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:51.300]  You know as far as I can tell it is the case now that it back to where we were where if somebody kicks your table
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:57.300]  Kicks your cable trips over your table cable while it's connected your your the MacBook is gonna go
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:03.300]  Right, so that is yeah, I don't know AppleCare Plus, I guess I guess you know, I guess you know
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.300]  I do think I honestly think that that's a
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.300]  Probably more than anything. I mean, there's a performance angle to where clearly performance wise. This is not a MacBook Pro
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300]  I mean, so if you're doing serious
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.300]  performance
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.300]  You know heavy stuff compiling stuff with Xcode or something or doing you know
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:28.300]  Video editing or anything that might strain your your computer. No, you probably still want a MacBook Pro
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:34.300]  But in terms of right it clearly this is positioned more against the errors than the pros not price-wise
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.300]  But in terms of you know use case scenario
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:43.300]  I would say the number one which one should you get question is how often do you use your laptop?
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.300]  While it's plugged in
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:51.300]  You know, I because I do think I think the comparison to an iPad is apt. I think that's why they've done it
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.300]  It's oh, I see what you're saying with that. Yeah, and I yeah
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:00.300]  I get it their answer to why isn't there magsafe on this and I'm not putting words in their mouth
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.300]  But the general answer would seem to me is you don't plug this thing in right, right? You don't use it plugged in
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:09.300]  So let's say you're a college student and you're you don't even take your adapter with you
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.300]  You keep it in your dorm room and you in the morning
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:18.300]  you leave your dorm room with a fully charged MacBook Air and you don't plug it in again until you
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.300]  Come back from classes at the end of the afternoon. It doesn't matter, right?
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:28.300]  I think there's a lot of people who use them in that context. I know in our context though, like the
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.300]  You know with the MacBook Air as the sort of default
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.300]  reporters
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:38.300]  Laptop, I mean, I mean it's not even sort of I mean it's infamous now
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:44.300]  It is yeah, because even you know people even take pictures at like Microsoft events and you take a look at the press and it's all these
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.300]  Apple logos lit up
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.300]  It's but there are you know
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:56.300]  We need plugs though because we're using them so so much, you know, we're yeah
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.300]  You're using the the wireless network, which is typically crushed and so it's harder for the radio
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.300]  The word radio is working harder. I will say this though
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:10.300]  Battery wise I could tell you when it changed for me this latest the latest MacBook that I have is a
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.300]  2013 model and
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:19.300]  That MacBook changed everything for me the air as far as battery goes
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:24.300]  I don't really plug in or worry about plugs at events anymore. As I remember I was covering
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:30.300]  WWDC in 2012 or maybe 2013. I can't remember but anyhow, I was talking about the
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:36.300]  2011 MacBook, right and I knew for a fact that that thing was not going to last all the way through and
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.300]  I was covering it at a time when I wasn't invited to any Apple events
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:46.300]  So I just got in line with everybody else and you know covered it from the crowd from way back in the crowd or whatever
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:51.300]  And did a whole live blog thing and my battery ran out with about 10 minutes left
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.300]  It was the it was the one where they were doing Maps
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.300]  It was the one where they're introducing Apple Maps
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.300]  And my battery ran out right before I started using Apple Maps
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:07.300]  And so I had to plug the rest of it from my phone. I mean it was essentially a nightmare scenario
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.300]  It was a WWDC right? It was a forestall introduction
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:17.300]  Exactly yeah and so my battery just went boop and I knew it was going obviously
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:22.300]  And there was no plugs because they only provide plugs for the reporters in their special you know section up front
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.300]  And so they don't provide plugs for anybody else because they're supposed to be sitting there watching and maybe tweeting
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:31.300]  I've never got a plug. That's news to me that there's plugs up front. I don't know
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:37.300]  Yeah there are plugs up there. You gotta fight for them. Everybody jostles for them
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:43.300]  But yeah I remember getting the new one and from that point on I have no longer worried about it
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.300]  And that's it as you mentioned that's an intense scenario right?
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.300]  You know hardcore wireless network you're posting pictures you're downloading stuff
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.300]  Maybe even tethering and so your phone is charging off of your laptop
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.300]  You know all of this stuff and never have I had a problem you know
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.300]  I think that it was a significant difference so that means with this new one
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:06.300]  You know we're taking a step back a little bit power wise
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.300]  But battery wise I think we actually may be in the same ballpark
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:14.300]  So it may be one of those scenarios where you can get through events and things in your day even
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.300]  Without having to plug it in. Maybe that's the philosophy
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.300]  I'm with you there like my laptop for years was a March 2011
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.300]  11 inch air and I've said this on the show many times
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.300]  It was the last air before the 11 inch got the light up keyboard
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:34.300]  So I had the last 11 inch air that had a not lit up keyboard
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.300]  And it was great it was you know so light and portable but you know
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.300]  The battery life was sort of a struggle on days like a WWD and I don't even
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.300]  I don't even use it during the keynotes I don't even do live blogging during the keynotes
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.300]  I'm just you know trying to follow along with the news
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.300]  Read all the stuff after the event and like you said
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:58.300]  I think that the fact that the cellular and wifi networks are always
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.300]  You know under an avalanche makes the antenna struggle
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.300]  But the big thing for me was always to get through a day like that
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:10.300]  I would turn the brightness all the way down as low as I could still read it
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.300]  It was the display. You're craning towards the screen
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.300]  So last year late in the year I bought sadly now
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.300]  One generation behind the 13 inch MacBook Pro instead of an air
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:26.300]  Because I was sick of the I don't care about the weight I just wanted a better machine
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:30.300]  And I have to say I'm with you the battery life now I don't know that I've ever
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.300]  Even gone into the red I don't think I've even gone to 20%
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.300]  It's easy to go through Yeah very very rarely I mean the only time it happens
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.300]  Is because I think I overestimate how far
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:46.300]  I can take it you know I won't charge it for two or three days or something like that
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.300]  I'll be like oh it's low but yeah very very rarely do I ever run up against it anymore
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.300]  I think they finally cross that threshold and it's not sad
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.300]  But the funny thing about this is that we all complain
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.300]  About battery life until it's good enough and then everybody
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:06.300]  Just stops talking about it so you never really know when that threshold was crossed
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.300]  You kind of have to think back like when did I stop complaining
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.300]  And I think that that's we crossed that Rubicon with this
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.300]  Like 2013 era Yeah and one of the things about the new MacBook
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:22.300]  That really stood out to me was when Schiller said that with the new screen technology
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:26.300]  That it's a 30% reduction in power draw for the same brightness
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.300]  Level that's huge that's a huge step up and like I said
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:34.300]  The number one thing that I used to do first thing I did
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.300]  If I knew I was going to have a stressful day on the battery was turn the brightness down
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:42.300]  You know the screen is still and it's you know it's true for phones it's true
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.300]  For everything screens are huge power draws
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.300]  And going retina only you know across the board only makes it worse
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:54.300]  Because you know it's not just the dimensions the size
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.300]  It's the number of pixels sure so a 30% reduction
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:02.300]  In power draw for the display to me like you
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.300]  Said and listing your five I think your five inventions are all spot on
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.300]  It's essential there's no way they could do this MacBook without that
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:14.300]  Because it would only be because you're talking about six hours of battery life and that's
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.300]  That's like a spec from ten years ago you know you can't do six hours of battery life
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.300]  And I think it may I mean I don't know if it is but it
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:26.300]  Seems like it's exo to me and I think that's where they got their reduction
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.300]  I haven't done any research into whether it is or not so please don't kill me if it's not but I think
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:34.300]  That it it might be an exo display which obviously the biggest
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.300]  Pro to those is battery life
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:42.300]  And the fact that they had to do all of this really really fancy
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:46.300]  Dancing with the battery and the size of the logic board to fit more battery and
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:50.300]  Etc etc and then get a screen with 30% less battery says a lot
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.300]  About the crappy nature of battery technology
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.300]  As it stands right now so they're still I like to
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:02.300]  Call it like their stop gaps right like so
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.300]  The increase in efficiency of a processor increase in
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.300]  Power efficiency of the screen massive amount more battery
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:14.300]  Inside due to the smaller logic board and this fancy layering technology all
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.300]  Of that is just compensating for the fact that the physical
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:22.300]  Limitations of battery chemistry are everybody's running up against
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.300]  Apple included yeah I totally agree it looked to me like the new logic board was about the size of an iPhone
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:30.300]  This is crazy yeah I actually saw an article today somebody
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:34.300]  Did some math I can't remember where it was digit times
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.300]  Or something but you know somebody did the math on the size of the
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.300]  Logic board it's actually smaller surface area wise than a raspberry pie
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.300]  Like the original raspberry pie that's crazy which I thought was interesting
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.300]  It'll be interesting to see whether
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.300]  This is something that competition
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:58.300]  Can copy or not you know in terms of
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:02.300]  You know and I've been meaning to write an article that would
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.300]  Under the working headline Apple semiconductor you know that
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.300]  If as a consumer you don't need to worry about it but as someone who
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:14.300]  Follows the industry you really have to look at Apple now as one of the leading
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:18.300]  Semiconductor companies if not the leading semiconductor
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.300]  Company in the world you know right there with Intel, Qualcomm,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:26.300]  Samsung whoever else you know and I and mostly
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.300]  Though that's been in the context of iOS devices and the watch right with
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:34.300]  The S1 where you've got A5 caliber performance
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.300]  Supposedly on this tiny thing on your wrist and with the
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:42.300]  You know the A series systems on a chip for the
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.300]  iOS devices but now that's one of the things that struck me about this device
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.300]  Is maybe I don't know enough about the industry but maybe this
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.300]  Logic board reduction is something that is every bit as cutting edge
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.300]  Engineering wise as the iOS systems on
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:02.300]  A chip. Yeah I don't know anything I mean not anything but I
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:06.300]  Don't know enough about it either to make that judgment so I don't want to blow it out of proportion
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.300]  Or anything but it seems I mean that's a pretty distinct if you've ever seen a logic
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.300]  Board in another MacBook it's you know it's double the size I mean it's pretty big
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:18.300]  So they have a almost double the size so they have
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.300]  They put a lot of effort into increasing the density of that board
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:26.300]  In order to fit more battery in there and it very well could be something really really fancy
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.300]  They did there. Yeah one of the little things I noticed I haven't seen a lot of people talking
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:34.300]  About it but I'm curious about it really curious and I know you were
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.300]  Very very kind to me and you were welcoming my questions
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.300]  I texted you questions if you could ask people you know apple reps
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.300]  Yeah it's not like I was busy or anything live blogging John it's no problem
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.300]  It's always the case though even when I'm
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.300]  At the event always inevitably the moment I
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.300]  Step foot past the threshold where I could go back and ask
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:02.300]  Another question always come up with my best question
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:06.300]  Sure and that was exactly it was like I don't know like two hours after the
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.300]  Event was over popped into my head why did they put the word MacBook
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.300]  On the front of the glass of the display again
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:18.300]  That is actually a really good question I know I love that why didn't you ask me that earlier
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.300]  But I could I love that my new you know this
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:26.300]  MacBook Pro doesn't say anything like an iPhone like the way that your iPhone
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:30.300]  Does not say iPhone in front of it I don't understand why they
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.300]  Put the word MacBook there I wish I could ask
[01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.300]  I actually didn't even I didn't even think about that until now
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.300]  It seems kind of gauche doesn't it yeah it seems you know like
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.300]  Of course it's a MacBook I know what I'm using exactly I think that that's why they never had it on the front of the
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:50.300]  iPhone right right and I early on I made fun of other
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.300]  Phones like you know the Motorola Droid
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.300]  Max Razor whatever for like pasting the logo several times
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:02.300]  On the front and back of the phone because it's like yeah we got it we bought it like we're
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.300]  You already got our money why are you why are you screaming it in my face
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.300]  I've always thought it was so curious that all the things that
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:14.300]  Competitors copy about and like let's take Samsung in
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.300]  Particular all the ways that Samsung has copied Apple
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.300]  Designs one thing they could copy and could not be held
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:26.300]  Accountable for it would be to copy the logo-less front face
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.300]  And they can't bring themselves to do it they have to
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:34.300]  Print they they're compelled to print the ugly Samsung
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.300]  Logo on every phone they make even though if they wanted to clearly you
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.300]  Can't copyright not putting a logo on the front face so they could make a plain black or plain
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:46.300]  White face that would look more like an iPhone but they can't bring themselves to do it
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:50.300]  I would just imagine like a design review meeting where
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.300]  Some designer you know in their in their laboratory
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.300]  Has gone through and said oh man this is a great piece
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:02.300]  Of Apple design here not putting it on the front and they remove it and everything and at the very last
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:06.300]  Second before it goes to production some exec walks by and says
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.300]  Why is there no Samsung logo on the front of this please put a Samsung logo on the front of
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.300]  This and then the engineer just slumps into feet and make it big
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.300]  Make it big make it reflective make it metallic because they are always
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.300]  Metallic like you look at the front of the phone and you move it back and forth and it shines
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:26.300]  In your eyes you're like really come on now but yeah I don't know I don't know why it's on there
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:30.300]  I don't and you notice I don't know if you notice this
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:34.300]  Or took note of it but the the logo is no longer
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.300]  Backlit right so it's polished logo on the back of the MacBook I thought about that
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.300]  I said I thought about that just when I said a few minutes ago that like at a Microsoft event you
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.300]  Look and you see all these lit up Apple logos yeah I think it's probably
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:50.300]  Just a thinness issue right I think that it
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:54.300]  There's just they you know maybe even power yeah right maybe
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.300]  But yeah thinness I think is probably it I mean that thing is really
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.300]  Really thin like when you look at it in person it's I mean pictures always make things
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:06.300]  Look thicker like the watch we'll talk about that but the
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:10.300]  The lid is really really thin and they had to layer that screen precisely
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.300]  To get it in there yeah I just think it's a thickness thing the other thing it's kind of
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:18.300]  Sad but a little bit but I'm not surprised I've sort of been thinking
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.300]  That they were heading that direction ever ever since the iPad shipped without a light
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.300]  Up logo ever since I've always thought it's you know it's got to be coming
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:30.300]  Other thing I noticed is that the keyboard
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:34.300]  Uses the San Francisco as the key cap font instead of
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:38.300]  VAG rounded which they've been using oh yeah I saw you tweet that I'm not I'm not a huge
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:42.300]  I'm a semi font nerd but now I'm not a huge one so I didn't notice that I've never really
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:46.300]  Cared for VAG rounded as the key cap font so I'm delighted by
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.300]  That change now what was it that you didn't like about it out of
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:54.300]  Curiosity it looks okay the capital letters look okay
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.300]  To me but they don't look great but the lowercase ones to me are just gross
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.300]  Like shift you know that everything's written in lowercase tab caps
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:06.300]  Like shift control and it's just like a it looks
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:10.300]  Childlike to me it's to me it's a childlike childish font
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.300]  It just doesn't look serious enough
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:18.300]  So you think San Francisco is a little stronger? Oh I definitely think so and I think it's
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.300]  Really to me the whole reason they're using it on a watch
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.300]  Is that it looks to me like a hardware font
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:30.300]  It looks like the type of typeface you would use to stamp
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.300]  You know the the stuff on the back of a watch case
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.300]  Which is exactly the font they're using to stamp you know stainless steel
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.300]  42 millimeters etc on the back it looks like a hardware
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:46.300]  Font it looks like something that you would stamp in the metal and so it looks good to me
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.300]  I haven't seen it in person obviously but it looks to me like a natural fit for hardware
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:54.300]  Like the key caps on a keyboard
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:58.300]  Just has a certain it has a certain seriousness to it
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:02.300]  Yeah one thing about the
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:06.300]  Watch stuff a lot of the like the companion app and the fonts on the
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:10.300]  Watch face there's like a mixture of stuff they're using and sometimes the mixture
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:14.300]  Is really awkward like the companion app has like two or three different fonts
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:18.300]  On the pairing screen it's really weird I don't know
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:22.300]  It seems like an unusual misstep or
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:26.300]  Decision anyway and it may just be a visibility thing or
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.300]  A differentiation thing like this is actionable this is not actionable
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:34.300]  But it seems like an odd choice to use fonts for that rather than stroke
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:38.300]  Thickness or you know an outline or something like that
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.300]  Maybe they're just handicapped by their decisions their design decisions and they have to kind of
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.300]  Make compromises in terms of differentiation between buttons and not
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:50.300]  Let's take a break you have anything more
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:54.300]  On the macbook before we take a break? No not really I mean the batteries
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:58.300]  I don't think that necessarily is like a world shattering
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:02.300]  Invention but I think it's a methodology that will be copied if it can't be
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.300]  You know ip wise I guess because the last the last thing I guess we should talk about
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:10.300]  And I've been asked this so I guess I should answer it is why didn't why isn't this called the macbook air
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:14.300]  And I think it's simply because it's too expensive that macbook
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.300]  Air is all once mac you know they anything that's called macbook air has to
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:22.300]  Be at the price points the macbook air is already at and then you know
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:26.300]  So that's why they've kept it that's why they've added it to the product lineup instead of replacing anything
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.300]  But then clearly as you know within a year or two
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:34.300]  Years it this will replace the macbook airs in the lineup
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:38.300]  As the price comes down once they can make one of these for you know eight ninety nine
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:42.300]  Or nine ninety nine the macbook airs will just go away yep
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.300]  Absolutely I think it's just a stake in the ground reserving that macbook
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.300]  Name for this design of macbook yeah and I think the
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:54.300]  Other angle too is in terms of
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:58.300]  A statement about the future that when the air debuted being
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.300]  So thin and light was remarkable and exceptional and I think apple
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.300]  Is saying now of course it's going to be this crazy thin and light that's
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:10.300]  The default this it doesn't it doesn't even need to be called out
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:14.300]  In the name this is just what a macbook is and should be
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:18.300]  Right right all right let me thank our next
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.300]  Sponsor and it is our good friends at fracture
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:26.300]  You know fracture they're the company you send them photos and they
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.300]  Print them directly on glass not a piece of paper
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:34.300]  That's behind glass mounted in a frame they take the glass I don't know how they do
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.300]  It nobody else does it it's crazy they take the glass they print your photo
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.300]  Right on it it is crazy it's exactly like the way that
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.300]  On an lcd like with the apple stuff where when it's laminated
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:50.300]  To the glass it looks like the pixels are right there on the surface that's exactly
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:54.300]  What images printed by fracture looks like
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.300]  They have all sorts of sizes everything from little small desktop
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.300]  Type sizes to really big things that you could hang on a wall
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:06.300]  And the quality is just amazing it is
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:10.300]  So great and it looks amazing you're going to get
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:14.300]  Questions because you can just mount it right on your wall then with no frame around it just a piece
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.300]  Of glass printed edge to edge with your pictures
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:22.300]  Really high quality really great service it comes in
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.300]  The most clever packaging that you could imagine where it's
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.300]  The actual thing that they ship it to you in itself is
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.300]  Can be used to prop it up on your
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.300]  Desk it's a little what would you call that a like an easel it comes
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:42.300]  With the stuff that you need behind it if you want to mount it on a wall
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.300]  Really really clever packaging really high quality and
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.300]  Every size imaginable free shipping on
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.300]  Orders over a hundred bucks and they have a code
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.300]  Just for listeners of the show
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.300]  Use this code when you order the code is to secret so
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:06.300]  I'm going to whisper it daring fireball all one word
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.300]  And you'll save fifteen percent
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.300]  On anything you order whether it's one picture or a bunch you'll save
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.300]  Fifteen percent which is a great discount by using the code daring fireball
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.300]  So where do you go where's their website how do you see this in action go to
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:26.300]  Fracture me dot com f-r-a-c
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:30.300]  T-u-r-e me me dot com
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.300]  And remember that code daring fireball and you'll save fifteen percent
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:38.300]  My thanks to them
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.300]  So now we finally come to the watch
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:46.300]  I mean it's like we've been resisting talking about it essentially but
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.300]  Yeah it's interesting what
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:54.300]  They chose to say additionally
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:58.300]  That they hadn't said before I mean the apple pay
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:02.300]  Was obviously a good tie in they mentioned apple pay I mean I guess let's start at the
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:06.300]  Top of the announcement right so they they bring out you know
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:10.300]  Tim comes out and introduces he introduced
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:14.300]  Kevin right he Christy Turlington
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.300]  He talked a bit oh no that's right you're right Christy Turlington was first yeah
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:22.300]  That's an interesting one what'd you think of that I thought it was good I saw
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.300]  That there was definitely some backlash where people were like cynically saying
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:30.300]  You know why go to you know why why more or less accusing apple of
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:34.300]  Exploiting you know Africa in the name of selling
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:38.300]  A thousand dollar watches I completely
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.300]  Disagree I think that there was no I think it was a total natural that they were
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.300]  Going to bring out somebody famous I mean not that they had to but it
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:50.300]  Sounds you know I'm sure if they wasn't her in Africa it would have
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:54.300]  Been somebody else here like in some alternate universe there's some other celebrity
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:58.300]  Or athlete let's say who they brought out here
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:02.300]  And show them training and exercising
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.300]  Here in the United States and it's every bit as much about
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:10.300]  Selling watches as it would as what they did
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.300]  Except that in this world where they brought her out and raised attention
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:18.300]  To her charity I can't help but think
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.300]  That that charity has made more money this week than they would have
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:26.300]  Made if apple didn't feature them right so in this world where apple did
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.300]  This and shared some of their attention with this charity
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:34.300]  That charity has raised more money and the
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:38.300]  Health and well being of women in Africa is
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.300]  Better than it would have been otherwise so I don't see I don't see how you can be
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.300]  How you can complain about that right I mean I think that there's
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:50.300]  An there is a definite contrast
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:54.300]  Sharp contrast between wearing say a thousand dollar watch because I think
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.300]  She was using like the steel one yeah it was not gold and right it wasn't
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:02.300]  That would have been the worst wouldn't it yeah she's running
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.300]  Through Africa with a $17,000 watch so
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.300]  I think there was definitely a contrast right but honestly her running shoes
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:14.300]  Were probably several hundred dollars right and anybody that goes
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.300]  To Africa on vacation to a wildlife preserve
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:22.300]  Which their money when they pay that money part of it goes to
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:26.300]  Funding that wildlife preserve you know when they go visit those things like anybody that goes there
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:30.300]  And is doing that thing there's always going to be a sharp contrast between say
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:34.300]  The watch or sunglasses or expensive clothing that they're wearing
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:38.300]  And the the natural state of the unfortunate natural state
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.300]  Of many of the people you know living in Africa who need
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:46.300]  Assistance or aid or whatever so there's always going to be
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:50.300]  A contrast it's always going to be a minefield right so I
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:54.300]  Get it that people drew them they were drawn to that dichotomy
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.300]  And I hundred percent think that it's a valid point
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.300]  But I think that your point in terms of they brought a person on stage
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:06.300]  Who wasn't just a face who literally was a mom who
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:10.300]  Started a foundation based on you know maternal wellness and
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:14.300]  Did all that stuff I mean that's
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:18.300]  Fantastic like why not you know they could have had an athlete they could have had
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.300]  Just somebody who makes millions of dollars and does nothing right
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:26.300]  And I think that that was a good choice for them regardless of whatever blowback they may take
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.300]  You know because of the visual I think that it was good
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.300]  I think it's almost like a tacit acknowledgement that yes there is
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.300]  You know the income levels
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:42.300]  Around the world are wildly disparate you know
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:46.300]  They're not hiding behind it I mean it's a tacit acknowledgement
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:50.300]  So I have to say I disagree with anybody who criticizes them for that I think it's
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:54.300]  It was only a good thing for the charity and I think it's a great cause
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.300]  Yeah and I saw somebody tweeting because there were plenty of people like why Chrissy
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.300]  Turlington who cares blah blah blah you know et cetera et cetera and
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:06.300]  I saw somebody tweet on Twitter and I can't remember who it is so forgive me but
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:10.300]  They were like you know you can complain about Chrissy Turlington when you have started a foundation
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:14.300]  Which has raised you know X amount of dollars for these things like seriously
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:18.300]  You know they could have had anybody on there any loser who
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.300]  Wanted to wear an Apple watch and come on stage or film a promo and instead they had
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.300]  Somebody who had really done real good and I think that you've got to acknowledge
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:30.300]  That yeah you know could have been you know Peyton Manning or something not you know
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:34.300]  Not even a loser you know I don't know I should say loser
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:38.300]  In flippant terms but yeah they could have had somebody who was just
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:42.300]  I just realized I really didn't mean to say that I like Peyton Manning I didn't mean it
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:46.300]  That was brutal I don't know or you know like some athlete
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:50.300]  Who was injured last year and you know used Apple watch to you know
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.300]  Condition themselves coming back from a knee injury or something I don't know could have been anything
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:58.300]  They could have had Pablo Sandoval out there you know oh this is
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.300]  How I lost my weight again I'm sorry Pablo I apologize
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:06.300]  But yeah I think that it's an
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:10.300]  Interesting it was an interesting choice and
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.300]  In the end I think it was a better choice than it could have been in a lot of ways
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:18.300]  I thought there was an interesting moment up front where when Tim
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:22.300]  Was talking about digital touch
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:26.300]  And as a communication feature with the doodles
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.300]  And the taps and the heartbeat and he said I hope somebody sends me one of those
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:34.300]  Which was I thought oddly personal you know like
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:38.300]  You know it seemed as though he was
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.300]  You know like saying I don't know I'm not quite sure
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.300]  How to interpret that you remember that Tim Cook looking for love
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:50.300]  Right yeah I think it was I mean I think it was a joke
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:54.300]  And it fell firmly in the dad joke range right which is what we usually
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:58.300]  Get on Apple Stages and I thought that was you know a good nod to that
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.300]  Yeah it was an interesting one I remember I remember that
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:06.300]  That is interesting I don't know I don't want to read too much into it but I think it was just a good joke
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.300]  Yeah I don't think there's too much to read into it but I do think that
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:14.300]  That's an important part of the watch though I think it's
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.300]  Very very I'm going to say downright essential
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:22.300]  To its success I really do think so I think if those
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:26.300]  Things don't take off and people don't use them they might be in trouble
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.300]  Yeah I think that
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:34.300]  I wrote the thing about the Apple Watch Saving Time which I genuinely believe it's going to save a lot of time
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:38.300]  But I acknowledge that
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:42.300]  Spending $300 or $500 or whatever to save time
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:46.300]  Seems silly but I think it may actually translate to
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:50.300]  Improved human relationships right so if I spend less
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:54.300]  Time looking at my phone I spend more time looking at my wife and kid I'm going to feel good about that
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:58.300]  And I'm going to feel happy because you can't
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:02.300]  You can't know until you
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.300]  Get I think this may come with age or it may come with if you get
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.300]  Really busy at work or you get really busy in your career or anything
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:14.300]  Like that you don't know the impact that extra time
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:18.300]  Has you know time with your family time away from that has until you
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:22.300]  Lose it or don't have it and then when you don't have it you would
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:26.300]  Do anything to get it back and I think that that is going to be a very powerful thing
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.300]  But I think along with that that interpersonal relationship
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.300]  You know with the taps and the constant communication the ability to literally
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.300]  Reach out and touch your watch which then
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:42.300]  Figuratively touches the other person which then literally touches the other person
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:46.300]  Right I think that that's an interesting translation and it'll be
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.300]  It'll be neat to see how that develops over time but we're not going to be able to tell
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:54.300]  People actually do it so they can say it all they want but we have to see
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:58.300]  Whether or not that actually takes off
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:02.300]  I talked about it on the debug podcast with Guy
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:06.300]  English and Renee Ritchie and the other special guest was John
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.300]  Edwards who's a watchmaker and app developer
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:14.300]  He's got apps that are like meant for people who are into watches like you can
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.300]  You know measure the accuracy of your mechanical watch
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.300]  With his apps and really really smart guy knows a lot about the traditional watch world
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:26.300]  But on that show I was talking about a thing that
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:30.300]  It was actually my friend Adam Lisagor you know Lonely Sandwich on Twitter
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:34.300]  The sandwich video guy but we talked about this at the singleton conference
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.300]  Back in October and he really opened my mind about this you know his thing was
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:42.300]  That he thinks everybody is just overlooking that Apple has invented
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.300]  The first ever way to touch someone
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:50.300]  You're intimate with without being within arms distance of them
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.300]  And in fact you can be you know around the world
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:58.300]  And that's really interesting maybe it'll turn out to be
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:02.300]  Nothing I don't know but I think that there's an enormous amount of potential
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:06.300]  There you know and I know that Apple keeps using the words intimate
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:10.300]  And personal our most personal device ever and you know
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:14.300]  It could just be marketing spin but I
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:18.300]  I don't know I honestly think you know and like I said earlier I think
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:22.300]  Apple's product marketing usually is really about the development
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.300]  Of the product and then the advertising is just telling you
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:30.300]  What they honestly think about it and so you know I think
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:34.300]  There's a scenario where that's truly what they believe that this is
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:38.300]  Intimate and that you know being able to send your
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:42.300]  Heartbeat to someone you have a crush on you know
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.300]  Or you know someone you've been married to for 10, 15 years
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:50.300]  Or whatever or your kid
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:54.300]  Is profound you know I'm
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.300]  Accident to brush this aside
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:02.300]  As a gimmick. The most intimate thing that I
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.300]  Have remotely with like my wife for instance is our
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:10.300]  iMessage stream right like that is our
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:14.300]  That's our communication method we don't talk on the phone a whole lot unless
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:18.300]  We have something explicit to say or we're driving you know in our
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:22.300]  Day to day like a picture of my daughter or a picture of where I am so
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:26.300]  She just knows I'm safe and where I am because I travel a lot for work
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:30.300]  That our iMessage stream is our intimate communication
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:34.300]  Window and I have an Android phone and I use that too but she doesn't
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.300]  So that doesn't become a conduit for us although I assume it's very similar for
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:42.300]  An Android user you know their text message inbox with their significant other
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.300]  Would be one of their most intimate streams of communication
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:50.300]  Back and forth but text messaging has this problem with
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.300]  Emotional context. It's very difficult to exhibit
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:58.300]  Or transmit emotional context in text messaging
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:02.300]  It's a constant problem right and that's why kind of emoji
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:06.300]  Was kind of took off and still obviously still on the rise
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:10.300]  I think people are very very fond of it but I think that that translating
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.300]  That into something that's tactile and visual
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:18.300]  On your wrist would be a very very powerful thing
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:22.300]  And I'm anxious to see how that develops. Yeah so here's like a scenario I was thinking of
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:26.300]  So like my son
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:30.300]  Desperately wants an Apple watch very very much so you know high expectation that he's
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:34.300]  Going to get one for Christmas
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:38.300]  Like imagine me picking him up from school
[01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.300]  It's three o'clock and you know I just want to let him know hey
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:46.300]  I'm here you know so one tap to communication
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:50.300]  One tap to pick his thing and then I give the phone a force tap
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:54.300]  So click the button one tap on the screen one force
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.300]  Touch and then all of a sudden he gets a tap on his wrist and looks down
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:02.300]  And it just shows that I sent you know my name is there and it just shows that I sent him a tap
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:06.300]  And then he'll just know that it's like me saying hey I'm here like I don't have to
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:10.300]  Say I'm here I don't have to send him any words just tap here I am
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:14.300]  I'm out back right like that and the context says the rest
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:18.300]  The context is the rest because he's on his way out the door you know at three three oh one
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:22.300]  After school's over like he'll get it you know
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:26.300]  That's pretty interesting to me
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.300]  This is essentially what the guys
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:34.300]  At Yo were trying to sell I said that on Twitter
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.300]  Oh you did okay maybe that's what I read but yeah
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.300]  It is right I mean that's the thing and so everybody made
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:46.300]  Fun of Yo you know that right like it became a big funny thing cause it's like what is it
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:50.300]  But I totally see it that
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:54.300]  Way you know and I feel like by being physical instead of
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:58.300]  Verbal instead of a stream of ASCII characters
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.300]  That display on a screen that you read by being
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:06.300]  Physical it could be that could be super important I try not
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:10.300]  To just dismiss stuff like that like Yo and like the
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:14.300]  Snap thing out of hand like I'll make jokes about Yo just like anybody else or whatever
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:18.300]  Cause I think it's funny especially when they're given millions of dollars before
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.300]  Having proven that it actually has traction or anything
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:26.300]  But I think that it's the simpler something is the easier it is
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.300]  To make jokes and fun about it you know and yet those
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.300]  Are usually the things that have the potential to be the most powerful because
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:38.300]  Of their simplicity so yeah Yo
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:42.300]  Non-verbal communication can be so important but it's always
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:46.300]  Been about being in proximity to
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:50.300]  Each other right like so like just another stupid example
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:54.300]  Now this one I don't know is replaceable by the watch but it's like imagine you're at
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:58.300]  A family dinner it's Thanksgiving or something like that and you're at the grandparents house
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.300]  And it's long and it's boring and people are talking about boring stuff and
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.300]  If you're sitting next to your kid you can just and you know that they're bored just
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:10.300]  Give their leg a little squeeze and then they look at you and you just give them a look like
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:14.300]  I know hey thanks thanks for putting up you know you can just shoot a look like hey
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.300]  Thanks for putting up with this I know this is boring you don't have to say anything
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:22.300]  Right and it's like non-verbal communication you can do things so
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:26.300]  That are so interesting and truth be told that the word applies it's intimate
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.300]  So I'm curious how it will play out
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:34.300]  I do think I think people did associate the oh yeah go ahead
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:38.300]  And I just think the other angle that's important is that it only works if everybody involved
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:42.300]  Has an Apple watch
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:46.300]  Yeah that's true I mean obviously that's important for Apple
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.300]  It's important for them to convince you that the
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.300]  Two way aspect of it is important because that means that
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:58.300]  You know you're going to get it's not just the most techy person in the family will own one
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:02.300]  Because then half the stuff that they that is available to them won't work
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:06.300]  Right you have to have it's sort of a family device
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.300]  That everybody has one so they have a potential
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:14.300]  To sell a lot of these things I think yeah totally
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.300]  What did you think of Kevin Lynch?
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.300]  So I thought he did pretty well
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:26.300]  I thought he was pretty good up there he seemed much more comfortable
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:30.300]  Than he was last time sort of owning his
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.300]  Position now and saying you know I'm okay being here
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:38.300]  I have things to say and you know
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:42.300]  I'm comfortable in my knowledge of them that's the way it seemed
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.300]  To come across but I liked it I thought he did a good job I thought he was personable he was comfortable
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:50.300]  He demonstrated his stuff fairly well
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:54.300]  Yeah I think you know we're all
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:58.300]  You know we're just being honest you know we're harsh critics of the
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:02.300]  Presenters at Apple events because the bar is so high
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:06.300]  And I think it was remarkable how much better he did
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.300]  I don't think he did terribly in September but it was awkward at times
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:14.300]  And he seemed a little just a little unpolished and I thought it was remarkable
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.300]  How much better he did having only done one of them before
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.300]  Yeah he was very very nervous last time
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:26.300]  You could tell and he definitely overcame that this time around
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.300]  I thought it was he stepped up you know because this is the Apple events
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.300]  The Super Bowl of tech events so I think he really stepped up
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:38.300]  And Craig Federighi comes to mind Craig Federighi when he rejoined Apple
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:42.300]  And his first on stage appearance was I forget when it was but I know it was the
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:46.300]  Back to the Mac event where they first announced hey here's a whole bunch of things
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:50.300]  That we've been doing on iOS that we're going to bring to the Mac in the next version
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:54.300]  And his hands were literally shaking like he had trouble going through
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:58.300]  The demo because his hand on the mouse was shaking and he wasn't able to click
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:02.300]  And it was almost like awkward to watch and now he's
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:06.300]  One of the best presenters they have in fact on Twitter a bunch of people
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.300]  Were arguing that he's the best that he's even better than
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:14.300]  Shiller or Tim Cook that he's the best that they have and it was only like two or three
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:18.300]  Events in
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:22.300]  Yeah I agree that he is one of their best he has a presence he comes on stage now and he seems like
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:26.300]  He's having fun he really he works
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:30.300]  The room you know and I think that that is a it's a different
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.300]  It's actually a different very different than Shiller's measured take
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.300]  Or Tim's like passion thing that he's got you know
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:42.300]  It's very much like hey we're all here we've got some really cool
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:46.300]  Stuff we think he'll love to see it you know let's just have some fun up here
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:50.300]  Look at my hair you know he comes across like
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:54.300]  To me like Bob Saget on the old Full House show like he's
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:58.300]  Just he just owns the dad joke nature of it you know
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.300]  And which is funny because and Bob and Bob's not like that at all right like
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.300]  Bob Saget is actually one of the like dirtiest comics
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:10.300]  Like anybody who knows anything about like stand up comedians and like knows
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:14.300]  That Bob Saget is like just brutally blue
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:18.300]  In his usual stuff so like the idea that he was like playing
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:22.300]  This g-rated dad on a hit show was like
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:26.300]  Just icing on the cake but but that's what right it was almost
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:30.300]  Stunt cast right you know it's just he wasn't extremely well known at the time right but he
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:34.300]  Totally you know he he bought into it though like you know he he totally sold
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:38.300]  And like Federighi is like that like his you know he totally owns the corny jokes
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:42.300]  That he you know sprinkles throughout this thing he's yeah and they
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.300]  Don't work if you don't right they don't they they they come off as forced or
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.300]  Awful or groan worthy and and people will groan even now but they're
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:54.300]  Grown good-naturedly because they know he's in on the joke yeah there's there's like um that's why he comes
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:58.300]  There's like a meta level to it it's like two levels deeper on the one level he totally
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:02.300]  Tries to sell the joke as hard as he can but on another level he's also got
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:06.300]  Like I know this is corny like he's not trying to convince you that this is
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:10.300]  You know anything but you know g-rated
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:14.300]  Corporate comedy you know he only that's why would people refer to dad jokes
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:18.300]  That's what they're saying like your dad knows what he's saying is corny but he's just
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.300]  Like he just wants to talk to you right that's all these duties
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:26.300]  Like trying to initiate a conversation and be like and he knows that you're gonna think
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:30.300]  It's corny and he's doing it be almost because of that right so that
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:34.300]  You guys are both in on the job and I think that's that that's what comes across there
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.300]  Uh let me take one last break here and then we'll we'll keep going on apple watch but I want to
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:42.300]  Have one more sponsor to thank and it's our good friends at
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.300]  Squarespace now squarespace is your all-in-one
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.300]  Website building designing hosting
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:54.300]  Product you go to squarespace and sign
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:58.300]  Up and boom you have a website the old days
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:02.300]  You said you know to get a website started geez what did you do you go to a hosting
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:06.300]  Service and what do you have you have like a html file like index.html
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:10.300]  That says like welcome to my website and then you have to start
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:14.300]  From there and you have to design your website figure out what it looks like then
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:18.300]  Figure out the html and css that would actually make
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:22.300]  It look like what you want it to look like and then you have to upload it all and then you
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:26.300]  Have to figure out some kind of content management system if it's
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:30.300]  Something that you want to update regularly like a blog or something like that
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:34.300]  And you had to do it all by hand squarespace is
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:38.300]  Totally different it's just a whole level up from that you go

[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.300]  Not by using code but just drag and drop if you want this
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.300]  Thing on the right instead of on the left you just drag it from the left to the right and boom there

[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:02.300]  Slash groober so if there's anything that I was
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:06.300]  Disappointed by in the event it was that they didn't really show
[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:10.300]  Anything new that they hadn't shown before and I kind of expected that
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:14.300]  They would except for third party stuff which they obviously
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:18.300]  Couldn't show at the original yeah I did I wanted them to
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:22.300]  To expose
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:26.300]  Their reasoning a little bit which they have done in the past right
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:30.300]  And I think that a lot of this comes in the form of on stage it comes in the form of
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:34.300]  We think this is going to be great for x and y right
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:38.300]  And that is their way of saying these are the things that we were thinking about
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:42.300]  When we made it right they don't do it always super explicitly but it seems
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.300]  Like you generally get kind of those knots right and it didn't seem like
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:50.300]  They did a whole lot of that for the watch yeah definitely not
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:54.300]  I and I think I I thought well I think it shows I think
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:58.300]  It for better or for worse I'm not
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:02.300]  Willing to say that they're wrong I'm not passing judgement yet but it seems
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:06.300]  To me like their message is starts with the idea
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:10.300]  That people want the apple watch and that it's largely
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.300]  About which one do you want and that they've
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:18.300]  They don't see the need to explain why you want it
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:22.300]  Do you agree I think that's true
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:26.300]  I think they don't see the need but I also think they're wrong
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.300]  Right so I think they they feel
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:34.300]  That if you have an iphone this first batch of watch users
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:38.300]  Will be people that have an iphone that want more iphone
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:42.300]  Stuff right that want more of that experience or want to have
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.300]  You know access to those things and here's some cool other things you can do with it
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.300]  And that's enough and that is okay and it may work just
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:54.300]  Fine but I think that they're wrong if they think
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.300]  And I'm also remember I'm projecting motivations on them at this point but
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:02.300]  If they think that that's enough I think they're wrong I think they actually do need to
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:06.300]  Or needed to focus a little bit more
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:10.300]  On use case scenarios because they're
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:14.300]  Going uphill against this
[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:18.300]  This sort of downward
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:22.300]  Pressure of it's more
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.300]  Money and it's another thing I've got in my life that may take
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:30.300]  Attention from me and I obviously because I wrote that I
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.300]  Feel that it may actually give you back time but I think that there was none of
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.300]  That explicitly said or very little of it
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:42.300]  I didn't mind the what's the
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:46.300]  Word the the conceit of kevin lynch's
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:50.300]  Demo of let's just run through a typical day in the life of
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:54.300]  An apple watch I think that was good you know and a lot
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.300]  Of it was third party but what was missing and they've never done
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:02.300]  Is like with the original iphone steve jobs was like here it is
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:06.300]  And then he showed it and here's the home screen and it
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:10.300]  Was here's what all the apps do I'm not quite sure that
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.300]  He opened every app but he certainly opened all the main ones
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.300]  Right he opened you know he went through safari he
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:22.300]  Went through mail he went
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:26.300]  Through the phone app and said you know we've you know we've reinvented the phone
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:30.300]  And you know here's you know voicemail sucks here now we've done it the right
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.300]  Way it's visual you get them in a list like just like your email and
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:38.300]  You can see who they're from and play them and delete them in a list like
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.300]  You know so you're not like an animal anymore sitting there stabbing buttons
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:46.300]  Right like you forget I mean voicemail sucks anyway and everybody nobody really likes
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:50.300]  Getting phone calls but god voicemail sucked before the iphone it was ridiculous
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:54.300]  Oh my god it was yeah it was so bad and once you got a
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:58.300]  Few messages deep it was just horrific and so yeah that on stage it was such
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:02.300]  A cool drink of water so like maybe like you know your dad and your mom
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:06.300]  Called you know what you know two or three times a week and a lot of times you have a bunch of voicemails there
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:10.300]  You've got a voicemail from you know like a doctor
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:14.300]  Appointment or something like that that's four or five deep now but you still need it because the
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:18.300]  Doctors that that message is the only thing you have that has the phone number of the office
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:22.300]  And you need to call them back because you have to move your appointment so it gets sucked before finding that
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:26.300]  Message and it's you know
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:30.300]  He showed it though right I don't know I think he went through like calendar maybe he didn't
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:34.300]  Go through them all but it just seemed to me like and and at least you could see what they all are
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:38.300]  And if he didn't show you the calculator app you saw the icon on the home screen and you knew
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:42.300]  Well duh it's a calculator I still think like to me it's crazy that like
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:46.300]  There's all these apps on the home screen of the watch that they still haven't
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:50.300]  Told us what they do like right out of the box
[01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:54.300]  Yeah there's a bunch of them like forget the app store forget you know which I
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:58.300]  Do think is important and it's you know it sent key to the success
[01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:02.300]  Of the thing long term as a platform but I'm just saying as an apple watch user you buy it
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:06.300]  You bring it home you put it on your wrist and there's a bunch of apps on the home screen
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:10.300]  And they still haven't explained them I'm really surprised by that
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:14.300]  And disappointed honestly Tim Cook did mention it he said
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:18.300]  You know like one of our team members who's wearing it loves using his watch
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.300]  To take pictures remotely but they didn't show it I can't believe they didn't show it
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:26.300]  Such a visual thing too like I just I just kind of
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:30.300]  Feel like however many icons there are on the home screen
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:34.300]  Out of the box they need to be justified explain to us why
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:38.300]  Why they're there you know and I guess you know I don't know
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:42.300]  To me there's a and maybe it's justified maybe they're
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:46.300]  I was going to say arrogance you know is justified that they're they know
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:50.300]  That it people will buy it and people will figure it out on their own
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:54.300]  But I'm surprised because to me that's what that to me is how they
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.300]  That that's why I say that it felt like two different events it like
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:02.300]  The first half focused on the MacBook did exactly what Apple
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:06.300]  To me always is the hallmark of it is that they here's
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:10.300]  Everything that's different and new about this here's why and
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:14.300]  You know the trackpad the keys the
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:18.300]  You know the new screen technology the lack of ports you know
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:22.300]  They're going away you know we do everything wirelessly now
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:26.300]  And we've you know done this amazing battery stuff to make it all work and shrunk
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:30.300]  The motherboard and got rid of the fans that we had room for batteries boom they explained it all whereas the
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:34.300]  Watch they're not doing that at all and I don't want to read too much into it because I really have no
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:38.300]  Idea behind the scenes who does what but it
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:42.300]  From the outside externally it's interesting to me that Schiller
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.300]  Has had nothing to do with the watch on stage
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:50.300]  And I don't know that is interesting
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:54.300]  You know I just I just couldn't I can't see him doing
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.300]  A presentation like this where it's not explained
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:02.300]  And again I'm not trying to say that there's any kind of
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:06.300]  Controversy inside Apple about it maybe he helped you know for all I know
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.300]  He was right there and stage directed everything about the watch thing even
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:14.300]  Though he wasn't doing it I don't know but it just is interesting to me
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:18.300]  I know to me it felt like a different tone and a different style of presentation
[01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:22.300]  And it's interesting that Schiller had nothing to do with it at either event
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:26.300]  It is interesting and it does it is against his sort of presentation
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:30.300]  Style not to say this is what it is and explain it
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.300]  In sort of enough detail but not too much
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:38.300]  To kind of get the point across why A it's special and B you'd want to
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:42.300]  Use it right yeah and that that I think was missing from the
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:46.300]  Watch I have you know I have this theory and I'll float it here I was going to write about it but I'll float it here for the
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:50.300]  First time you can tell me what you think so I have this theory about the whole use case scenario
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:54.300]  Obviously I think time saved is an initial metric to look at
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:58.300]  You know when you get a watch I'm going to try to do this myself
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:02.300]  I'm going to try to gauge how many times I look at my phone during the day and then I'm going to get the watch
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:06.300]  Put it on and then measure how many times I look at the phone after that
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:10.300]  And then see what the differential is I think that would be an interesting metric to look at
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:14.300]  But beyond that so that's the initial thing
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:18.300]  My theory is that they have another strong use case for this
[01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:22.300]  But it depends on third party
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:26.300]  Buy in and time so they can't
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:30.300]  Talk about it yet and that use case is that
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:34.300]  The Apple Watch becomes a tube of lubricant for your life
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:38.300]  So you have the watch on your wrist you walk up to your
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:42.300]  Car and your car unlocks with either a confirmation
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:46.300]  Tap or just by proximity then you probably a tap I would guess
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:50.300]  Because you want confirmation of a secure thing unlocking
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:54.300]  Then you get in your car and your watch tells your Apple
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.300]  CarPlay display that you want to listen to this music
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.300]  And this is you in the car so you can adjust your seats or whatever the case may be
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.300]  To you and it loads up your navigation for your morning drive
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:10.300]  On your Apple Maps because it knows this is the time you go to work
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:14.300]  Or you go to school or whatever the case may be
[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:18.300]  You go to a gas station, you get out, you walk in, you pay for coffee with your Apple Watch
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:22.300]  You walk out, you get into your car, you drive to school
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:26.300]  You get out, you walk in, you hand in your homework by
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:30.300]  Tapping your Apple Watch a couple times to transmit your homework to your teacher
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.300]  You sit down, you cheat on your test with your Apple Watch
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:38.300]  You get the gist, right?
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.300]  These lubricants will add up to
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:46.300]  A time-saving theme but they sort of allow you to do this
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.300]  And the model for this is the MagicBand at the Disney World
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.300]  Where they have this band that has NFC and Bluetooth in it
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:58.300]  And it's your wallet and it's your ticket to the park
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:02.300]  And it's your FastPass which allows you to jump the line
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:06.300]  And it's your signal that tells a cast member that you're nearby
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:08.300]  And they can come up with a personalized offer like,
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:12.300]  Hi Matthew, would you like to meet Cinderella? She's right over here. You know, all of that stuff
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.300]  And I think that there's a lot of fear involved in that but there's also a lot of possibility
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:20.300]  And I think that that maybe is their long game here
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:24.300]  But they can't talk about it yet because they have to have the buy-in from the car manufacturers
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.300]  And from the POS and from, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:32.300]  Yeah, I agree with that
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:36.300]  I think that calling it
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.300]  A little lubricant or life lubricant
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:44.300]  I gotta refine that because, yeah, I think that that's the scenario
[01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:48.300]  I also think that maybe more than
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:52.300]  Time saved what they're trying to pitch it at
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:56.300]  And this, to me, it's not any different than any other smartwatch
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:58:00.300]  In terms of the mission statement which is, to me, attention saved
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:04.300]  That it takes less of your attention to glance at your watch than it does to glance at your phone
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:08.300]  Johnny Ive had an interesting quote
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:12.300]  In the Financial Times interview
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.300]  Or feature that came out a week ago where he said something about with a traditional
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:20.300]  Watch that he noticed that many times he'd
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.300]  Glance at his wrist to check the time and then realize
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:28.300]  That he hadn't even really noticed the time and had
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:32.300]  You would have to look twice because like the first time he was paying so little attention that it
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:36.300]  Didn't even register
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:40.300]  That's how lightweight a watch can be that you can almost pay
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:44.300]  Not enough attention and have to check twice
[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:48.300]  And that's interesting and I do think that's sort of where they're going but on the other hand
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:52.300]  That pitch is no different than the pitch for Android Wear or for Pebble or for
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:56.300]  Anybody else
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.300]  The only difference is that it's our thing and so we're going to make it easier than their thing
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:04.300]  Yeah, you know the communication angle
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:08.300]  Is all Apple, the sending a doodle, sending a heartbeat, sending a tap
[01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:12.300]  That's, you know, nobody else has anything like that
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:16.300]  And it's very intimate and personal, the notification thing is like
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:20.300]  The obvious feature that everybody has thought of
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:24.300]  Right, right, I agree, so and I mean the reason, just the very fact
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:28.300]  That we're having to dissect this makes me think that maybe they didn't communicate these things
[01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:32.300]  As easily as they could. One of the things they showed and I know
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:36.300]  That they've said this and people have noticed that for example somebody sends you a text
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:40.300]  And it will show up on your watch and you can respond
[01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:44.300]  Either like I think three ways
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:48.300]  It's like you hit respond and it'll try to give you a couple of guesses
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:52.300]  In a button, you know, an example being
[01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:56.300]  You know I'm at the supermarket and I could text my wife
[01:59:56.300 --> 02:00:00.300]  The shopping list just says butter and I could say salted
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:04.300]  Or unsalted butter and then the AI is going to parse that and if she answers
[02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:08.300]  On her watch she will have buttons that say salted, unsalted, not sure
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:12.300]  Which is cool, obviously
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:16.300]  It does not cover every scenario and then you can use the microphone to either
[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:20.300]  Send a recording of audio or to have
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:24.300]  The dictations dictate what you say
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:28.300]  I could see that being useful but to me it's interesting and
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:32.300]  Telling and sort of questionable that you can't do that for email
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:36.300]  For email you can only read and if you want to reply it has to
[02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:40.300]  Be handed off to your phone
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.300]  And I can kind of see why because emails are longer and more complex and you know
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:48.300]  How much dictation, you know, like text is the right amount of
[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:52.300]  Length, implicit, implicit, not necessarily enforced
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:56.300]  Like I don't know, I'm not even sure what the largest iMessage you're allowed to
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.300]  Send is in terms of words, I don't even know if there is a limit but you know there's an implicit
[02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:04.300]  Idea that it's a sentence or two whereas an email might be longer
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:08.300]  But they showed it, they showed on stage like reading an email on Apple Watch and it
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:12.300]  Seems ridiculous, right?
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:16.300]  Yeah it does, the people that I talk to
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:20.300]  That have been using it kind of like on and off for a while or
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:24.300]  Have had it on their wrist, they say that it's actually much more readable I guess than it seems
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:28.300]  And my experience in person was I pulled up some stuff that I could read
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.300]  And I scrubbed back and forth and it's definitely readable but it's
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:36.300]  Tiring, right? The reason they call them glances and the reason that a lot of their stuff
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:40.300]  Is based on you flipping your watch up to look at it is like I was doing a demo
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:44.300]  Recording a demo with Darrell, my coworker, and we were, he was filming
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:48.300]  Me and I was running through the watch's paces, right? For our like, you know, Apple Watch hands on
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:52.300]  Something and as I'm holding my wrist up there and I'm dinking around with it and it
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:56.300]  Took like 3-4 minutes or whatever to record the demo, 5 minutes, and by the end
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:02:00.300]  Of it, my arm kind of hurt. Now I'm a little out of shape but I don't think that had anything
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:04.300]  To do with it, it's just, it's an uncomfortable position to hold for a long period of time
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:08.300]  Like if you hold your arm up and out in front of you and position it so that you're
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:12.300]  Looking at like your watch face, if you hold that for any more than maybe 30 seconds
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:16.300]  It starts to get uncomfortable, it's just we're not sort of built to do that
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:20.300]  And I think that that's an interesting thing. I don't think we're, I think we may
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:24.300]  Read something a couple hundred words long but not much longer than that
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:28.300]  I've heard from people who've been to the
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:32.300]  Third party lab, you know, that they're hosting, that they're inviting developers out for
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:36.300]  That maybe, I might even be the first thing that they say
[02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:40.300]  Is that anything, any feature you're thinking about for a watch app
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:44.300]  Should be 10-15 seconds
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:48.300]  Or less of time. And if your idea is something that will
[02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:52.300]  Take more than 15 seconds, it's probably not a good idea for the watch
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:56.300]  And if your idea currently
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:00.300]  Takes more than 15 seconds and you can't, you know, you should try to figure out a way
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:04.300]  To make it 10 seconds. And I don't think it's so much about
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:08.300]  Partly it's about battery life but I think partly it's, even if the battery was
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.300]  A week long of serious use
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:16.300]  I think that that advice will still stand for exactly the reason you said
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:20.300]  It's just the nature of something on your wrist is
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:24.300]  Ergonomically and whatever else, psychologically even
[02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:28.300]  Is, you know, glances. Yep. And the further away you get
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:32.300]  From glances, the less useful it is and the less people will want to
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:36.300]  Utilize whatever app you've designed. And I think there's going to be a
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.300]  Learning curve for that. People are going to ship stuff that's obviously not right
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:44.300]  Or doesn't work right. Did you
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:48.300]  In the hands-on experience that you had, did you get to feel the taps?
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:52.300]  Oh yeah, I did. And they're really cool. I mean, and this is
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.300]  I'm glad you brought that up because this whole TapTik thing is so worth talking about
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:00.300]  Because I think it's a big part of Apple's future, you know, on all
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:04.300]  Their devices. Oh yeah, we shit the bed by not talking about it with the MacBook.
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:08.300]  Well, we can do it now. Good recall. Did you get
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:12.300]  Like, I felt taps in September, but they were all part of the demo loop
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:16.300]  And the only taps I felt were when a text message arrived and I thought, man, this
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:20.300]  Is really cool. Do you agree? It's not like a vibration at all. It's a new
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:24.300]  Sensation. Right. Yeah, actually
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:28.300]  It's haptic feedback, but it's done by the use
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:32.300]  Of what they call lateral force fields
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:36.300]  Which is essentially these forces that are directed sideways at one another
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.300]  And I believe it's the collision of those forces that they can shape
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:44.300]  To direct the pressure
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:48.300]  Downwards towards your wrist. Did you get to demo the whole
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:52.300]  Left-right thing? Because that was something I didn't get to experience in September
[02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:56.300]  No, I didn't. And they repeated it. They repeated it again that if you're
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:05:00.300]  Using it for walking directions, it'll give you a sense of turn right
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:04.300]  Like, I still can't imagine what that's like. It sounds awesome
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:08.300]  But I still haven't gotten to experience it
[02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:12.300]  No, that's a good question. I didn't do that. I wish I had
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:16.300]  Now. Yeah, I could see how they could shape it, though
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:20.300]  To go left or right. Just knowing a little bit that I know about the technology
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:24.300]  There was this... I mean, this goes for the engine
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:28.300]  Because I think that the engines share a lot of similarities between the Taptic engine and the watch
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:32.300]  And the vibration or haptic feedback engine that's underneath
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:36.300]  The Macbook's touchpad. They share a lot of similarities
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:40.300]  And they're essentially based on the
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:44.300]  Same overall
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:48.300]  Theory of the way that they shape and move these vibrations
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:52.300]  So the trackpad, and I just published something on this last night
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:56.300]  I asked some coworkers and they didn't know. But the trackpad doesn't move
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:06:00.300]  On the Macbook at all. There's some sort of
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:04.300]  Nanometer that they say it's allowed to move, but it doesn't move
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:08.300]  Essentially. Because a nanometer is 100,000th the thickness of a sheet of paper
[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:12.300]  Or something. But it doesn't click. It doesn't actually physically move
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:16.300]  So when you press it, there's a sort of pressure sensitivity
[02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:20.300]  Threshold that you're allowed to adjust, which I think is going to have great implications for
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:24.300]  Accessibility. People with motor skills issues and things. But there's a
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:28.300]  Certain pressure that you're allowed to push, and once you pass that threshold, it
[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:32.300]  Ends this signal using these LFFs
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:36.300]  These lateral force fields to
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:40.300]  Simulate that the keypad has clicked. And it's the same thing that's using
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:44.300]  The Taptic Engine is using, I believe, to direct the force straight down
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:48.300]  Into your wrist. And it definitely feels straight down, like a finger
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:52.300]  Pushing into your wrist. So hands-on with the Macbook, did it feel
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:56.300]  Good, like clicking? Oh, it felt so good
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:07:00.300]  An Apple person actually had to tell me it didn't move. Really?
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:04.300]  Because I missed that it didn't move or something. There's a lot going on, and I guess I just missed it
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:08.300]  And I was clicking on it, and it was like, oh, cool, cool. Later on, an Apple person told me
[02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:12.300]  Oh no, it doesn't move at all. Because I thought that it had one level of click, and then
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:16.300]  With the force touch thing, you push down further, and then it vibrated your finger
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:20.300]  And you felt like, oh, I'm clicking downwards further. But he's like, no, it doesn't move at all
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:24.300]  That says everything, though, that you didn't even realize that
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:28.300]  So in other words, the best way to put it, I guess, would be if the Macbook is powered off
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:32.300]  There's no click at all. It's like tapping the non-trackpad part
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:36.300]  Yeah, I had an Apple person tell me that they actually would set two of them
[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:40.300]  Side by side, I guess they were testing and playing with them, and they could play piano on them
[02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:44.300]  Because they're so... they basically send all those pulses up
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:48.300]  And you could rotate your fingers on them and get this sort of piano feel
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:52.300]  But yeah, if it's off, that thing's not going to vibrate. It's not going to click at all
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.300]  It's just a piece of glass
[02:07:56.300 --> 02:08:00.300]  New stuff tends to ship iOS first. I mean, iOS is still the only thing with
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:04.300]  Touch ID. It's just the nature of today's Apple
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:08.300]  I think it's pretty telling that Force Touch and the Taptic Engine
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.300]  Came to the Mac before iOS, and I think the easiest
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:16.300]  Prediction of 2015 is that this year's new iPhones
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:20.300]  Are going to have Force Touch, and probably, I would bet, iPads too
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:24.300]  Yeah, easily. And I think there's a Wall Street Journal thing that came out
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:28.300]  Like a report last night or this morning or something that said, you know, iPhones
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:32.300]  Later this year are going to have Force Touch, and yeah, it was like duh
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:36.300]  Obviously, right? There is... remember too that it's
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:40.300]  Two separate technologies, right? So you have Force Touch, which is the
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:44.300]  We know how hard you're pressing, so we can do different things depending on how hard you
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:48.300]  Press, and then there is the feedback
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:52.300]  In those fields, right? Yeah, exactly. Those haptic... that haptic feedback
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:56.300]  And it would be interesting to me if one comes to the iPhone without
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:00.300]  The other, because it feels like they're intertwined technologies, right? Because you get the four sensors
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.300]  Around the trackpad, which they determine how hard you press, and then in the middle
[02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:08.300]  You've got that engine, which can give you the vibrations back
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:12.300]  I think it's both will come, because
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:16.300]  How cool will it be if... I think it would be so great if your buttons on your phone
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:20.300]  Actually click. That's so great! Oh my god
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:24.300]  That seems like
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:28.300]  Honestly, it seems to me like it'll be best on
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:32.300]  IOS. Even more impressive than it is anywhere else
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:36.300]  Because I think that would be so cool to have touch screen buttons that actually
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:40.300]  Click. Oh man, that'd be great. I'm excited just thinking about it
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:44.300]  I'm waiting to email John Chen to ask him for his reactions
[02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:48.300]  The CEO of Blackberry. I just want to... like all these years
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.300]  You've got your wish. Like clickable keys on the iPhone
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:56.300]  God, I didn't even think about it for typing. I didn't even think about it, but that'd be
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:00.300]  That'd be great. The other thing they even say
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:04.300]  They're saying for the Mac with the trackpad is
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:08.300]  That it's pressure sensitive drawing
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:12.300]  And that's on a trackpad. Now, take that up. How much better
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:16.300]  Would it be for pressure sensitive drawing on an iPad? It's crazy
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:20.300]  It'd be fantastic. And I think it really makes sense to me
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:24.300]  That the pressure is registered on the device and not through
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:28.300]  The stylus. So you have a dumb stylus or your finger
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:32.300]  And a smart pad, which is where the
[02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:36.300]  Pressure is registered. I think all previous efforts that put the pressure
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:40.300]  Sensitivity in a stylus, they had to if they wanted to work on IOS
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:44.300]  Obviously, but I think that's the backwards way of doing it
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.300]  Yeah, totally. 100%. And it makes an iPad
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:52.300]  Instantly more attractive than say a Cintiq or something like that
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:56.300]  Because you're drawing on this mobile device that has all these
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.300]  Capabilities and now it has pressure sensitivity as well
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:04.300]  The one thing that they would be missing at that point, which I would really love to see
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:08.300]  Them fix, is the latency issue. Because they're
[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:12.300]  Way above the 10 millisecond threshold. They're at like 30 or 40 or something
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:16.300]  Or maybe even higher. I can't remember what it is exactly. But below
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:20.300]  10 milliseconds is where you sort of get this
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:24.300]  Feel where it's one to one. Like your pen tip. It follows your pen tip
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:28.300]  Exactly. Because right now if you scrub on an iPad drawing, your
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:32.300]  Drawing falls way behind the iPad typically
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:36.300]  Or the stylus tip, rather. And that's a screen latency issue
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.300]  So if they were able to fix that, and
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:44.300]  Give this sort of pressure sensitivity to the screen
[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:48.300]  It would instantly make it the best drawing surface out there
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:52.300]  Electronic drawing surface out there. And a lot of artists are already doing amazing work
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:56.300]  Drawing on iPads, but like you said
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:00.300]  It could totally take it to another level. And I agree, latency is totally an issue
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:04.300]  I'm not an artist. I don't really draw. But I notice it whenever I have to sign my name
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:08.300]  Sign out on an iPhone or whatever
[02:12:08.300 --> 02:12:12.300]  It lags behind. And it's surmountable
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:16.300]  There are many artists doing really really cool stuff on iPad. I've seen tons of art
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:20.300]  Apple's last ad thing featured a bunch of art created on iPad
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:24.300]  So there's obviously people doing neat stuff there, but they're bypassing that
[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:28.300]  Difficulty by training themselves. And I think that just giving them
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:32.300]  The one to one, the true one to one, as we've always had
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:36.300]  With like taps and scrolling, but doing that with like
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:40.300]  Vigorous drawing or expressive drawing would help a lot for sure
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:44.300]  What did you think of the watches
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:48.300]  Themselves? Like which any of the bands stand out to you?
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:52.300]  So I'll make my
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:56.300]  Purchase prediction now. I think I'm probably going to end up with
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:00.300]  The black
[02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:04.300]  Space black with the black rubber band. I think that's
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:08.300]  Probably what I'm going to end up with. And not because I don't like the Lynx
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:12.300]  But just because I think it's, I just think I'm going to get more
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:16.300]  Day to day use out of that. And then I may end up purchasing like Lynx separately later on
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:20.300]  But like the black with black Lynx or the black with the band is kind of
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:24.300]  What I'm leaning towards right now
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:28.300]  The black with the black sports band
[02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:32.300]  Yeah, but that's the sports band, right? Because I think the black steel one only
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:36.300]  Comes with the Lynx. Oh, I see what you're saying. You're talking
[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:40.300]  About black aluminum
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:44.300]  Right, with the steel. Yeah. No, probably black aluminum. Because the steel only comes
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:48.300]  With the steel Lynx. So it would be either one of those two things, yeah.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:52.300]  Yeah, those are the exact two that I like
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:56.300]  Although I'm not sure, I want to see it in person. Because it does seem to me, and I know a lot of people
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:14:00.300]  Said it on Twitter, that it looks like the black steel
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:04.300]  With the Lynx bracelet is darker than what they showed in September
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:08.300]  And what they've had on their website until yesterday or until Monday
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:12.300]  But I don't know though if that's a difference in like the product
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:16.300]  Photography or if they actually change the material between them and now
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:20.300]  Right, right. Yeah, I was just saying. I mean I think they could have
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:24.300]  They could have definitely enhanced it maybe to make it a bigger differential
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:28.300]  It's possible, for sure. But I think that the black or the black steel
[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:32.300]  Is probably the most instantly attractive to me. But in person
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:36.300]  The black one looks gorgeous. I mean it's highly, it's like a chrome
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:40.300]  But it's very, very, very pretty. I think that they did a great job with that
[02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:44.300]  And the black steel Lynx, that's just, it's beastly. It's a very manly
[02:14:44.300 --> 02:14:48.300]  Design, obviously. I don't want to project, you know, and
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:52.300]  Some women may love it, but it seems to me like it's aimed at the male market
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:56.300]  But almost all of them had an attractiveness
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:00.300]  A genuine attractiveness. The aluminum ones
[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.300]  The aluminum ones do look very utilitarian next to the other stuff
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:08.300]  Like almost everything else looks very classy, very polished and refined
[02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:12.300]  And the aluminum ones are aluminum, you know
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:16.300]  And there's just a difference there. And remember too, the aluminum ones are the only ones that don't have
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:20.300]  Like a colored crown. Like the end of the crown is just bull-nosed
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:24.300]  Aluminum. So there's definitely a feeling of like, hey
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:28.300]  This is a tool where the other things are maybe a little
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:32.300]  Bit more your personal style, you know
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:40.300]  Hey everybody, Jon here. Sorry about this, but the next minute
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:44.300]  Or two of the audio of this episode is a bit garbled
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:48.300]  Like some kind of awful sounding digital artifacts
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:52.300]  Something from a low-rent horror movie or something
[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:56.300]  We're not sure what happened. Nothing we can do about it. Seemed better to keep it for the content
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:16:00.300]  Than to cut the whole thing and have the show be a bit disjointed
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:04.300]  But I figured we'd do an insert here just to let you know that it's not like
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:08.300]  You got a bad copy of the file or something like that. This unknown issue lasts about a minute or two
[02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:12.300]  We'll do our best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Sorry about that, and
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:16.300]  Thanks for listening.
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.300]  My pricing guess is pretty good. I certainly got the additional right
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:24.300]  I overshot off a steal, and in hindsight
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:28.300]  Basically, the mistake I made was overlooking how easy it is
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:32.300]  Physically, mechanically to swap bands, and there's no reason for that
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:36.300]  If they weren't going to try to sell multiple bands
[02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:40.300]  At your purchase, which means the pricing
[02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:44.300]  I should have been able to guess exactly the final pricing for Steel
[02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:48.300]  Because once you assume that the bands would be priced to sell
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:52.300]  Everything else falls into place
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:56.300]  I think what's interesting in pricing wise, though, so let's say you want to get
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:00.300]  A 42mm Steel
[02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:04.300]  And you want to get the Link Bracelet
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:08.300]  It's $999, right?
[02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:12.300]  Unless you want to get the Black, right?
[02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:16.300]  Or 50 bucks more or something? Let me double check
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:20.300]  Yeah, $999, and it's $50 premium
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:24.300]  Or no, $100 premium to get Space Black
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.300]  But let's just say you get the Silver one, the Silver colored stainless steel
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:32.300]  $999
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:36.300]  If you buy the Sport model, it's $600
[02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:40.300]  And the Link Bracelet is only $450
[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:44.300]  So it would only...
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:48.300]  So I guess you'd pay $50 more then? I guess it all works out
[02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:52.300]  So if you buy... I was thinking that you would save 50 bucks, but no
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:56.300]  I was getting confused between 38mm and 48mm prices
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:00.300]  So no, it's exactly the same. So you don't pay any penalty if you buy the one
[02:18:00.300 --> 02:18:04.300]  That comes with the rubber band and buy a Link Bracelet, you pay the exact same amount
[02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:08.300]  As if you buy the one with the Link Bracelet and buy a
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:12.300]  $50 rubber band. So that's it
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:16.300]  Well, I remember too, though, that you've got a metal mismatch there
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:20.300]  Louis Mantilla made a nice chart of stuff that quote, matches
[02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:24.300]  end quote, and stuff that doesn't. In other words, the pin is a different metal
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:28.300]  than the casing, or the buckle is a different metal than the casing, or even the links are
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:32.300]  a different metal than the casing. So those won't match
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:36.300]  Because there's only steel and black steel in the Link Bracelets
[02:18:36.300 --> 02:18:40.300]  So those won't match the casing
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:44.300]  finish on the aluminum. So if you don't mind a metal mismatch
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:48.300]  then you're golden. You can do that and it won't cost you any extra, but
[02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:52.300]  it won't match. It won't match exactly the metals
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:56.300]  Yeah, and I don't think that matters as much. I think anybody who does it, it's not going to look bad
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:19:00.300]  per se. Because it actually is slightly different than the steel anyway
[02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:04.300]  Because the steel, the case is highly polished and the
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:08.300]  bracelet is not. The bracelet is sort of brushed
[02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:12.300]  Which actually makes sense because the bracelet is going to take more scratches
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:16.300]  It would scar and scuff, right?
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.300]  You see that a lot on traditional bracelet bands
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:24.300]  Some of them are polished, but that's more like when you get a platinum or gold or something like that
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:28.300]  If it's stainless, it's often not polished
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:32.300]  And on the physical nature of the watches, while we're talking about the bands and the casings
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.300]  For listeners, if they haven't had the chance to feel these things
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:40.300]  They're a lot thinner than they look. Both the bands and the casing
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:44.300]  And this goes for all the bands. All of them are a lot thinner
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:48.300]  In person, width-wise, height-wise I should say
[02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:52.300]  Than it looks like in these images. These images make them look like the camera adds
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:56.300]  10 pounds. The camera is adding 10 pounds to all of these casings and bands
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:00.300]  Because I'm looking right now at an image of the 42mm stainless steel
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:04.300]  With the link bracelet, and that link bracelet looks fat
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:08.300]  And it's not. It's actually surprisingly thin
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:12.300]  And the same goes for the casings, too
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:16.300]  I should have predicted that. I think they're going to sell a ton of these bands
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:20.300]  Especially the Milanese loop is only
[02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:24.300]  $150? Yeah, which I was surprised by
[02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:28.300]  I think that's almost like a no-brainer. I think people might be hesitant to buy
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:32.300]  The link bracelet, since it's
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.300]  You will be able to just buy the sport watch and get the link bracelet
[02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:40.300]  But I think people who are price-sensitive enough to want to go that way
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:44.300]  Aren't going to want to spend more on the link bracelet
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:48.300]  Than the watch itself costs. I just don't think that's going to come up much
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:52.300]  I'm sure some people will do it, but I think it's not even worth worrying about
[02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:56.300]  Should Apple have done something
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:21:00.300]  To try to prevent it? Yeah, I think you're right
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:04.300]  The more I look at it, the Milanese, I've noticed actually a lot of people from Apple
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:08.300]  Wearing those. It seems to be pretty popular
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:12.300]  The ease at which it goes on and off, and the classiness of it
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:16.300]  I think it could be the dress band of choice for a lot of these people
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:20.300]  That buy a sport, or even a steel with a sport band
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:24.300]  Because of the cost. It could be the dress band of choice for the masses
[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:28.300]  And I think that it definitely has maybe a more
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:32.300]  High fashion appeal, because the Milanese bracelet
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:36.300]  Unless you were a watch fanatic, you probably never even knew the name, even if you saw it
[02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:40.300]  In a casing or whatever. But it's obviously a very classic bracelet, it's been around a lot of years
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:44.300]  But I just think that it may actually have a nice dressy, shiny metal
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:48.300]  Feel for people that don't want to spend the
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:52.300]  $450 for the steel bracelet. I think that's actually going to be a popular
[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:56.300]  Dress one. Yeah, and if you're the sort of person who's fussy about
[02:21:56.300 --> 02:22:00.300]  Having something sized perfectly, and I am. In my life I've always worn
[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:04.300]  Watches, and there's been a lot of times in my life where I've bought a watch and found
[02:22:04.300 --> 02:22:08.300]  That there are like two holes, like with a classic buckle
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:12.300]  And one's a little too tight and the other one's a little too loose, and I've always
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:16.300]  Regret that whoever designed the watch
[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:20.300]  The strap hadn't moved the holes like half a click
[02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:24.300]  Up or down. The Milanese loop
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:28.300]  Doesn't have that problem, because you can size it to exactly
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:32.300]  Where you want. One size fits all, so to speak, or continuously adjustable
[02:22:32.300 --> 02:22:36.300]  Right, anybody who's fussy about that is going to love that
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:40.300]  As a sizable thing
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:44.300]  I think the other thing I guess I wanted to talk about
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:48.300]  Is the timing of the event, and I know there were a lot of questions going in
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:52.300]  They've been saying April, but then why are they holding this event on March 9th
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:56.300]  And the answer is, I don't know
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:23:00.300]  Even after the event, right? Like, I'm not quite sure
[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:04.300]  So the timing is they had this event on March 9th
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:08.300]  The next date is April 10th, which is
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:12.300]  When they're going to start taking preorders and when they're going to have
[02:23:12.300 --> 02:23:16.300]  Watches in Apple stores to look at
[02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:20.300]  And then the next date is April 24th, which is when they're going to start
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:24.300]  Shipping and selling. Am I, I think I have all that right?
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:28.300]  Yeah, those are the dates, yeah. So why hold the event
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:32.300]  What, seven weeks in advance? A month in advance
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:36.300]  Of preorders and
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:40.300]  One, two, three, four, five
[02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:44.300]  Six weeks before it ships
[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:48.300]  I don't get it. I don't either, and
[02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:52.300]  My mind's totally blank on this issue, so
[02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:56.300]  The only thing I can spitball on this, to use your phrase
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:00.300]  Is that they might be trying to give reviewers
[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:04.300]  A bigger window
[02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:08.300]  As far as I know, review units weren't issued for these watches yet
[02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:12.300]  But, I mean, I certainly don't have one, I'll freely say that
[02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:16.300]  I don't know if I did have one, I would probably say the same thing, but
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:20.300]  Well, you'd say nothing. No, that's right, you're right, I would say nothing. So yeah, I don't have one
[02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:24.300]  So, but it would seem to me that maybe they want to give people more time
[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:28.300]  With them, because they feel that there's more time, but that's literally, and I'm speaking
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:32.300]  Not as a person who, I'm not assuming that I'm going to get a review unit, I never do
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:36.300]  I've only ever gotten one review thing and I think it was probably an accident
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.300]  Somebody probably included me on a list, an accident
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:44.300]  Maybe as an interested party, like anybody else, I'm thinking
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:48.300]  What if you want to give people more time to live with these things before they write
[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:52.300]  A review of them, rather than the traditional one-week window, and I know they like to keep that window
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.300]  Tight, but look at the distance between, say, the pre-order and the sale, that's a lot of time
[02:24:56.300 --> 02:25:00.300]  You know? So, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know, it might be
[02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:04.300]  Different because, like, hey, reviewing a new phone
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:08.300]  You know what an iPhone does, you've been out for six years
[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:12.300]  You need more than eight days to review it, because all you're really reviewing is what's new
[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:16.300]  Which, like, this year was, it's bigger
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:20.300]  Touch ID, or Apple Pay, and
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:24.300]  How good is the new camera? You can do that in a week, and maybe
[02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:28.300]  You're right, maybe this all-new platform
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:32.300]  A new way to get through your day of interacting with your devices and staying connected
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:36.300]  You might need more time. I can honestly say, this is the weird thing about me not having been at the event
[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:40.300]  You know, I do not have a review unit, nor
[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:44.300]  Have I talked to anybody at Apple about getting one
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:48.300]  So, you know, I'm completely in the dark as to whether anybody
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:52.300]  Has one, whether I'm going to get one, and if I did, when
[02:25:52.300 --> 02:25:56.300]  At some point I might have to shut up and stop talking, if I do
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:00.300]  It's just like a warrant canary, where, like, the company, they take it off their website, and you're like, oh my god
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:04.300]  The NSA is, like, they just say, hit them up for info
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:08.300]  You can just keep listening to the talk show and see if I say, I don't have a review
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:12.300]  Unit at Apple Watch, nor have I been told that I'm getting one
[02:26:12.300 --> 02:26:16.300]  So I don't know. I would be very, very surprised
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.300]  If anybody has one right now. I just don't think that they
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:24.300]  Would give them out six weeks in advance, it just would be so unlike them
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:28.300]  I wouldn't be surprised if maybe they give, if they seed them April 10th
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:32.300]  You know, two weeks in advance
[02:26:32.300 --> 02:26:36.300]  Which would be a little bit more time than they usually do, but I don't know
[02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:40.300]  And the other thing that's weird about it is, in my experience, getting review units
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:44.300]  Since 2011
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:48.300]  Every time I've ever gotten a review unit of any product
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:52.300]  From Apple, big, you know, flagship or minor upgrade
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:56.300]  It's been given to me in
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:00.300]  Person, and they don't just ship them
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:04.300]  I have heard of them shipping review units, but I don't know that it's
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:08.300]  Ever been a new category, well, it's never been a new category of product, it's like
[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:12.300]  An upgrade to something, or whatever. I have heard of them doing that
[02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:16.300]  I've gotten them for software products, like they've sent me a review unit
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:20.300]  With the
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:24.300]  Yosemite public beta on it, so that, you know, it's weird
[02:27:24.300 --> 02:27:28.300]  It's like they do... Oh yeah, right, that makes sense, because it's not like the object itself
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:32.300]  It's the software, yeah. Right, and it was shipping on a totally
[02:27:32.300 --> 02:27:36.300]  Bog standard MacBook Pro. It's just a funny thing
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:40.300]  I think they make a list of who they want to send them to, based on
[02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:44.300]  Whatever criteria, and then I made the list and they sent it, but it's just funny because
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:48.300]  I was already running the Yosemite public beta on my actual MacBook, because I'm in the developer
[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:52.300]  Program and I know how to do it, and I know the risks
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:56.300]  They do it for good reason, that they don't want typical
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:28:00.300]  Journalists risking, you know, screwing up their MacBook
[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:04.300]  By putting a public beta on it. Sure, yeah. But
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:08.300]  There's no way they're just going to ship me this, but if they haven't given them out
[02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:12.300]  There's a chance I could get, like I will not, there's no way I'm going to be able to fly before
[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:16.300]  April 24th, so if, you know, if there are
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:20.300]  Review units, but I don't think they're going to have another event, so I don't think there
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.300]  Would be any reason to fly, so maybe they'll hold briefings in New York like they
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:28.300]  Sometimes do, and I could do that, so I can take a train
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:32.300]  I just can't fly. Yeah, I mean, if they did it separate from an event, because normally they do
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:36.300]  These things away from an event, right? So if they, or at an event, rather
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:40.300]  So if they're doing it away from an event, it would be a similar thing to when they held
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:44.300]  Briefings, you know, in New York for whatever it was, Mavericks
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.300]  Yeah, I think it was Mavericks. Yeah, and there was a bunch of people invited to that and they'd just
[02:28:48.300 --> 02:28:52.300]  Be the trip to the city from wherever they were, or if they were in the city, they came, you know, and there was
[02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:56.300]  Several scheduled throughout the day, so they could
[02:28:56.300 --> 02:29:00.300]  Feasibly do that, but it would seem to me that it would limit
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:04.300]  Their ability to talk to the people or give them to the people that they wanted to, because
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:08.300]  I'm sure the reviewers are scattered everywhere. It's not just journalists, I have
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:12.300]  I would be insanely shocked if they gave an addition
[02:29:12.300 --> 02:29:16.300]  To a journalist and not to a watchmaker, or not a watchmaker, but a watch reviewer
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:20.300]  Right? Like a high-end fashion reviewer or
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:24.300]  A watch reviewer, I could see them giving an addition model to them
[02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:28.300]  To evaluate from that perspective. I actually see two new
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:32.300]  Areas where I would be surprised if they don't. I would say
[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:36.300]  It's dead certain. The one I would bet money on is that they
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:40.300]  Will cede review units to fashion people, like
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:44.300]  Vogue or, you know, I don't know enough about the fashion world to say who would
[02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.300]  Get them, you know, but like Vogue, GQ
[02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:52.300]  Magazines like that, from the fashion world
[02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:56.300]  But that's not necessarily the watch world, not like the watch world, you know, like the
[02:29:56.300 --> 02:30:00.300]  Ben Clymer, Hodinkee type guys, but I think they'll probably cede them to them too
[02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:04.300]  But I think it's more certain that they'd give it to the fashion people and a little less certain that they'd give it to the
[02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:08.300]  Watch people, because I feel like the watch people are still sort of
[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:12.300]  There's a sort of, you know, this is interesting, but it's not really a watch watch
[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:16.300]  Because, you know, it's the mechanics of a mechanical watch that are
[02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:20.300]  So big a part of the obsession. And everything else is ancillary
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:24.300]  It's really the movements and the creation of that that we're interested in
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.300]  Yes, but I don't know, but if I had to bet though, I'd bet a little bit less
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:32.300]  Than the fashion people, but I would bet they'd give it to them too, because the one thing that is mechanical are
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:36.300]  The bands, and I know just from talking to Ben Clymer at the last event
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:40.300]  They're super super interesting to the watch people, because they've really
[02:30:40.300 --> 02:30:44.300]  You know, in a lot of ways, like the modern buckle and the link bracelet
[02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:48.300]  They've really shown up the watch world
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:52.300]  If the link bracelet holds up, and there's a question about that, because link bracelets
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.300]  Traditionally, it's called stretch, where if you get
[02:30:56.300 --> 02:31:00.300]  An older Rolex, if you buy a vintage Rolex
[02:31:00.300 --> 02:31:04.300]  Usually the band is, the bracelet is loose
[02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:08.300]  It jangles a little, just because over time
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:12.300]  The connections between the links get stretched
[02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:16.300]  And the companies like Rolex and Omega, you know
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:20.300]  The higher end ones have gotten good at that over the years, and they make bracelets that last a lot longer
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:24.300]  Now, Apple's brand new at this, so there's a question as to whether
[02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:28.300]  The link bracelet one year later is going to still be just as tight
[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:32.300]  As it was when you bought it, but the engineering that went into it is
[02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:36.300]  Insane, assuming that it is though, they've totally shown them up, like the way that you can adjust
[02:31:36.300 --> 02:31:40.300]  It and take links off without a special tool is groundbreaking
[02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:44.300]  And the clasp is way better, the clasp on the
[02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:48.300]  Apple link bracelet is way better mechanically
[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:52.300]  In terms of cleverness than the clasp on a Rolex
[02:31:52.300 --> 02:31:56.300]  So that's why I think they'll probably give it to the watch people
[02:31:56.300 --> 02:32:00.300]  I think the watch people will probably spend more time writing about the bracelets than they will
[02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:04.300]  The software
[02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:08.300]  So I don't know, I really, it's so funny that they held this event
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:12.300]  I went into it thinking that they were going to answer just about all my questions
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:16.300]  And they honestly, I feel like they answered almost none of them, really
[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:20.300]  Or at least fewer than half, I still have no idea when they're going to seed review units
[02:32:20.300 --> 02:32:24.300]  I feel like they have to, right? They're not going to let this thing ship without having anybody
[02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:28.300]  Review it. I mean that would look, the optics would look so bad
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:32.300]  It's like when they release a movie and the review embargo drops the day before
[02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:36.300]  And everybody's like, oh yeah this is going to be great
[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:40.300]  It would be, it would be, it would be, yeah
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:44.300]  Because if they don't give review unit, and I just say this saying
[02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:48.300]  Take myself out of it. I don't feel entitled to one. I don't know. I never know whether I'm going to get
[02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:52.300]  A review unit or not. My guess that I might is only based on the fact
[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:56.300]  That I've gotten review units of everything for the last few years. But if it ever stopped
[02:32:56.300 --> 02:33:00.300]  If I just never get a call and April 10th
[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:04.300]  And 24th come and go, I'll just buy one
[02:33:04.300 --> 02:33:08.300]  You know, in the years before I got review units, I'll just buy one and evaluate it
[02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:12.300]  But I'm going to write about it either way, right? It's just a question of when it'll
[02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:16.300]  The review will come out. And everybody else will. Like that'll be true
[02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:20.300]  For every public. Everybody who wants to review the Apple Watch is going to review it whether they have to wait
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:24.300]  To buy one April 24th or not. So I can't see why they wouldn't give
[02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:28.300]  Review units if, you know, but when and how?
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:32.300]  Total mystery. So crazy. I mean the thing to me about it
[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:36.300]  The reason that the more timing makes sense is because it is a new category
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:40.300]  You have to think about it a little differently. And if they give people more time
[02:33:40.300 --> 02:33:44.300]  To think on it, I think that they'll be better off. Because if they did
[02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:48.300]  Wait and just everybody bought one and evaluated it, everybody's going to be in this
[02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:52.300]  Mad rush to write about it. And they mean
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:56.300]  If Apple feels that you need to live with it to let it simmer
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:00.300]  Before you start to see the value in it, then it makes sense for them to give you more time
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:04.300]  That's such a good point. I didn't even think about that because I'm never in a rush to be
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:08.300]  First. So I wasn't even thinking that. But so many other people are. You're right
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:12.300]  What'll happen if they don't see the review units is people
[02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:16.300]  Will buy it like when the Apple store opens on April 24th
[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:20.300]  Or noon or whenever they say they're going to start selling them. And they're going to try to publish a review like two hours later
[02:34:20.300 --> 02:34:24.300]  Oh sure. Yeah. It'll be a rush. I mean just speaking of somebody who is
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:28.300]  Yeah, we're at a different position. Like the instant the embargo drops
[02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:32.300]  We are under pressure to publish because that initial
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:36.300]  The capture of initial attention, that's important
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:40.300]  To a publication. And so everybody's going to be rushing to get that
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:44.300]  And if there is no holds barred, like no embargo, everybody's just
[02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:48.300]  Going to be publishing willy nilly. They're going to be publishing all kinds of wackadoo
[02:34:48.300 --> 02:34:52.300]  Hack job reviews. And I give my
[02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:56.300]  Writers just for context. I give my writers permission to publish whenever they want on this stuff
[02:34:56.300 --> 02:35:00.300]  I don't, I'm not sitting there over their shoulder. Are you done with this? We've got to publish when
[02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:04.300]  The embargo drops. Usually it's ready because like Daryl usually does our reviews and he does a great job
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:08.300]  And he's very conscientious and takes care of business, right? But
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:12.300]  My philosophy on it is publish when it's ready, not when everybody else is
[02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:16.300]  And like last time I published my review like the next day or something, right?
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:20.300]  And I'm totally fine with that. 100% philosophically. But a lot of publications
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:24.300]  Are not at all, right? They are like get it out now
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:28.300]  Really? I don't care what state it's in. Finish it. And so you're
[02:35:28.300 --> 02:35:32.300]  Only going to exacerbate that issue if you just
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:36.300]  Let it drop and everybody just rushes to crap out
[02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:40.300]  Like hack jobs about the watch. Yeah. It'll be curious. So I'm curious
[02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:44.300]  To see. I'm going to assume that they will seed review units. It'll be
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:48.300]  Curious to see whether it's more limited than usual because they want to be
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:52.300]  Careful about who has reviews for the embargo dropping whenever
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:56.300]  Their embargo date is going to be. I presume typically it's like the Tuesday or Wednesday
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:36:00.300]  Before the Friday that they ship. Or if it'll be more
[02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:04.300]  Not more inclusive than usual
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:08.300]  But as inclusive as the iPhones and iPads have been lately where they've
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:12.300]  Really cast a wider net
[02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:16.300]  Which I think strategically is sort of like the new
[02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:20.300]  Open Apple and I think it is a little bit. It's confidence in the products
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:24.300]  And that they. It's actually to me less risky because
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:28.300]  If they're confident in the product then the consensus of the reviews
[02:36:28.300 --> 02:36:32.300]  Will get it right and one bad review won't sink it
[02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:36.300]  Whereas to me it's dangerous to do it like they did with the original iPhone
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:40.300]  Like where there were only. I think there were only four people who had review units. There was
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:44.300]  Pogue, Mossberg, Steven
[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:48.300]  Levy had one for Newsweek and I think Ed Beg for USA
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:52.300]  Today. I'm not sure about it Ed. But those are the only
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:56.300]  Four people I think who had review units for the original iPhone
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:00.300]  So if even one of them had had a bad experience with it
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:04.300]  That would have been like 25% of the reviews were this thing's no good
[02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:08.300]  Yeah their Rotten Tomatoes score goes way down right? But if you have 70 people doing it
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:12.300]  And three of them didn't like it it's no big deal
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:16.300]  So I don't know. I'd be curious to see but I feel like they're so different in so many ways
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:20.300]  These days that it's fun but it means it's a lot harder to predict
[02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:24.300]  I guess we should wrap up but one thing we haven't even touched on
[02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:28.300]  Is the edition. Oh geez
[02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:32.300]  What do you think? I'll let you kick that off. What do you think?
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:36.300]  Well I think I was right
[02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:40.300]  You guessed 10,000 for starting right?
[02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:44.300]  Right. I think I talked myself down from it with the rubber band
[02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:48.300]  Because I'm still confused by this but it just seems to me
[02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:52.300]  So incongruous that a $10,000 watch would have effectively
[02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:56.300]  The same band as the $400 one. Yes I know that the pin is made out of solid
[02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:00.300]  Gold. But it just seems like a weird play to me
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:04.300]  That they didn't do what I thought they might do which is have a gold
[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:08.300]  Link bracelet and a gold Milanese and charge for them
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:12.300]  Maybe they just aren't ready or maybe they couldn't execute on them?
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:16.300]  Maybe they're not. Maybe the people who are speculating that maybe the gold is too hard to work
[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:20.300]  Into those shapes are true. I don't know. But it just seems to me like
[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:24.300]  They're leaving money on the table. If anything though, it means that my pricing was actually low
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:28.300]  Because if they do come out with a link bracelet in gold
[02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:32.300]  I think it's going to be 30,000 or maybe 40, not 20
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:36.300]  Because they're charging 17 for the modern buckle
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:40.300]  That modern buckle, the more I look at it
[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:44.300]  It's like the most obvious statement in the world. But that red
[02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:48.300]  Leather with yellow gold is so clearly
[02:38:48.300 --> 02:38:52.300]  Aimed at China. And there might be women all over the world
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:56.300]  Who are itching to get that because it's a cool looking thing. But I mean
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:39:00.300]  It's like literally the colors of the Chinese flag. Like Chinese New Year
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:04.300]  Everything is red and gold. That is so clearly
[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:08.300]  If you had to ask me what the primary market for the edition is, it's not rich people
[02:39:08.300 --> 02:39:12.300]  In America. It's rich people in China. That's my opinion
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:16.300]  That's just one person's opinion. This is not some grand pronouncement
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:20.300]  But I really think that a significant portion of edition sales will be there
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:24.300]  And I think Apple expects them to be there. Because there is money in China
[02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:28.300]  And there is an intense focus on status and this concept of
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:32.300]  Face. Of having status through possessions and
[02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:36.300]  Through gifts and that sort of thing. So I think there's definitely going to be an enormous market
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:40.300]  For it there. I don't think it's just rich dudes in America who want to show off
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:44.300]  Status. I think it's rich, I shouldn't say dudes, but rich people everywhere
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:48.300]  That want to show off status. And I think that there's going to be a big market
[02:39:48.300 --> 02:39:52.300]  For it outside of the billionaires
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:56.300]  Who want to pronounce their billionaires here. It's going to be everywhere
[02:39:56.300 --> 02:40:00.300]  Yeah, and it's definitely a cultural difference too
[02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:04.300]  Where here there's an awful
[02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:08.300]  They're definitely going to sell some in the United States. No doubt. I mean they're going to sell some everywhere
[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:12.300]  But in terms of what it says when you see somebody who's wearing one. A lot of people
[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:16.300]  And I'm sure the tech-minded audience of this show. There's a lot of people out there
[02:40:16.300 --> 02:40:20.300]  Who are listening to us speak right now. Who are going to think exactly what I'm going to say
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:24.300]  Which is, let's say you're out. You see somebody at the bar
[02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:28.300]  Next to you. And you see, holy shit, that's a gold Apple watch. And your first thought
[02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:32.300]  Is going to be douchebag
[02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:36.300]  In Asia though, it's not the case. It's, you know, ostentatious
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:40.300]  Displays of wealth have a different cultural connotation than they do here
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:44.300]  Right. It's like the concept of fitness
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:48.300]  How that's changed. Like in Roman times, if you were fit, that meant you were a field worker
[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:52.300]  Right? And if you were, you know, relatively, you know, corpulent
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:56.300]  Or full-figured, either as a man or a woman
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:00.300]  That meant you had leisure time and you had the wealth to have other people do your manual labor for you
[02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:04.300]  And to have the ability, you know, food itself
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:08.300]  Was a luxury. Totally. I agree with that
[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:12.300]  I thought it was
[02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:16.300]  I thought it was almost baffling how little they talked about addition
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:20.300]  And I did. I really do. And I hate
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:24.300]  To say this because I could be totally wrong. This is 100%
[02:41:24.300 --> 02:41:28.300]  Speculation on my part, but I sense conflict
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:32.300]  And internal conflict and disarray among their ranks
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:36.300]  With regard to how little they talked about it. Because it clearly was not cut
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:40.300]  For time. The event was only 88 minutes long. And two hours is the limit
[02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:44.300]  On an Apple event. I mean, you know, obviously if they wanted to go more than two hours, they could
[02:41:44.300 --> 02:41:48.300]  But I know that internally they shoot for two hours or less. And like the September
[02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:52.300]  Event clocked in at exactly two hours and that was, you know, they
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:56.300]  Clipped stuff. It was very, very, very clipped in terms of, you know,
[02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:00.300]  We have to do three things. These new phones, Apple Pay, and the watch. And we
[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:04.300]  Got to squeeze U2 in at the end. It was hard.
[02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:08.300]  You have to touch fingers at the end. But they could have. And so for example
[02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:12.300]  They talked about
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:16.300]  Sport and then they had a little Johnny Ive video talking about how they make the aluminum. Then they talked
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:20.300]  About Apple Watch and they had a little Johnny Ive video talking about the steel
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:24.300]  And then Tim Cook said, you know, like three
[02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:28.300]  Sentences about addition and then the event was over. There is a video. It's on Apple's
[02:42:28.300 --> 02:42:32.300]  Website. There's a video the exact same style of Johnny Ive talking about
[02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:36.300]  How they make the gold. I mean, why they didn't show that in the event is
[02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:40.300]  Baffling to me. Like, why not brag? If you're going to brag about how you made
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:44.300]  Some aluminum, why in the world wouldn't you brag about how you made the gold? I cannot
[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:48.300]  Help but feel that there is some kind of disagreement there about the messaging.
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:52.300]  Exactly along the lines of what us on the outside have been saying all along
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:56.300]  That this seems like it's not, you know, selling $17,000
[02:42:56.300 --> 02:43:00.300]  Watches doesn't seem like Apple. Exactly.
[02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:04.300]  And I mean my argument on it is that if you have
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:08.300]  A gold watch that works exactly the same as a lower end
[02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:12.300]  Watch, then there's two ways to look at it. You can look at it from the person
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:16.300]  Who buys the aluminum and says that gold watch works exactly the same
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:20.300]  As mine. That person who bought it is an idiot. Right? Or you can
[02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:24.300]  Be the person who has the money to buy the gold watch. Now I don't ascribe to this whole
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:28.300]  False argument like, oh, you could buy this or you could buy, you know, you could
[02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:32.300]  Contribute to charity because anybody who has this kind of money can spend money on anything they want.
[02:43:32.300 --> 02:43:36.300]  This is not a person who scrimps and saves $10,000 to buy a watch.
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:40.300]  This is a person who for $10,000 is maybe not throwaway money
[02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:44.300]  But it's certainly not a problem to spend this kind of money. Right?
[02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:48.300]  So they buy this watch and they put it on and it works exactly the same as the lower end one
[02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:52.300]  You can look at the person with the aluminum and go, oh, I'm so glad I could
[02:43:52.300 --> 02:43:56.300]  Afford the gold. And I think that what that comes down to is
[02:43:56.300 --> 02:44:00.300]  You've got this argument both ways, up and down, and it comes down to how it makes you feel
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:04.300]  Like that's the pro argument for having the gold
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:08.300]  If it makes you feel better, wear it. It works exactly the same as the other one
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:12.300]  So we're not shortchanging the person who can only afford the aluminum
[02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:16.300]  You know, the people are saying, oh, well if it had another sensor or another this or another that
[02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:20.300]  I would buy it. I would spend more money on it. But to me, that would be anti-apple
[02:44:20.300 --> 02:44:24.300]  That would be a very un-apple thing to do to make the
[02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:28.300]  The one whose materials were more
[02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:32.300]  Expensive work better as well. And instead
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:36.300]  You know, they're saying, no, you can buy whatever you want. It's up to you
[02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:40.300]  Here you go. Yeah, I
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:44.300]  You know, as my predictions have been high for the price of edition all along
[02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:48.300]  And I've not been opposed to it in and of itself
[02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:52.300]  Just because the price is high. Because
[02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:56.300]  To me, the people who are so upset about it and feel like that it's a sign
[02:44:56.300 --> 02:45:00.300]  That Apple has changed inevitably, you know, for the worse
[02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:04.300]  As a company, and that they don't stand for what they used to stand for. All of those arguments to me
[02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:08.300]  All sound as though the Apple Watch Sport doesn't exist
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:12.300]  You know, like if this, and quite frankly
[02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:16.300]  Given the $550 starting price
[02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:20.300]  For the steel, I actually think it would be fine then
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:24.300]  If the Sport didn't exist this year and the starting price was the
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:28.300]  $550 $600 steel version
[02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:32.300]  I actually think that's not bad either. Because that's, you know, that's where the iPhone
[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:36.300]  Started at $600. But the fact is there is one for $350
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:40.300]  $400. And so I don't understand the argument that
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:44.300]  The price of the gold one alone is any kind of a bad sign
[02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:48.300]  And again, because they're functionally equivalent, I feel like it's
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:52.300]  Egalitarian downright. I am not put off by the price at all
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:56.300]  I think they're going to sell them, and why not? I think they're, you know, it's interesting
[02:45:56.300 --> 02:46:00.300]  And I don't think they had to. I think that if they had, likewise
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:04.300]  If they had shipped Apple Watch and never done the gold one, and the most expensive model
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:08.300]  Was the space black steel one, that would have been fine too. I don't think anybody
[02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:12.300]  Would say they've botched it. I think it's interesting. But the price
[02:46:12.300 --> 02:46:16.300]  Doesn't bother me. And I'm bothered by the fact that they
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:20.300]  Seem uncomfortable talking about it. That they're of two minds about it
[02:46:20.300 --> 02:46:24.300]  Right? Like if you're going to do it, own it. Like if you're going to offer
[02:46:24.300 --> 02:46:28.300]  A gold fancy model because you want it to appeal
[02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:32.300]  To people who have this amount of money to spend, just say
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:36.300]  Some people like nicer things. So nicer metals
[02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:40.300]  Maybe not even nicer is the wrong word for it, but whatever. Some people like these materials so we're offering
[02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:44.300]  It. But don't, like, be ashamed of it. Right?
[02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:48.300]  So a lot of people have been saying to me, like with my $10,000 starting price
[02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:52.300]  Two arguments I heard. One of them was
[02:46:52.300 --> 02:46:56.300]  Somebody, a couple people told me, you know, you know this because you're in San Francisco
[02:46:56.300 --> 02:47:00.300]  Or, you know, TechCrunch is in San Francisco, but you know that there's a lot of
[02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:04.300]  Apple employees have been spotted wearing Apple Watch for the last couple months
[02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:08.300]  About. And I've gotten emails from people who've seen
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:12.300]  People wearing gold ones. So they're like, well
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:16.300]  That's obviously not going to be $10,000 because what company would give an employee a $10,000
[02:47:16.300 --> 02:47:20.300]  Watch to wear as a test unit? And my answer to them is always
[02:47:20.300 --> 02:47:24.300]  Apple. Right. Exactly. Like that was
[02:47:24.300 --> 02:47:28.300]  Not proof that the thing was not $10,000. Like Apple has
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:32.300]  Some money, you know. And also Apple's cost is not $10,000
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:36.300]  Like the watch doesn't cost $9,000 to make
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:40.300]  But the other thing
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:44.300]  That people have said is, well, how are they going to announce that price
[02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:48.300]  You really think Tim Cook's going to stand in front of a slide that reads 9999
[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:52.300]  And also it's interesting to me, I should have predicted that they're not going with 9999
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:56.300]  Pricing, it's $10,000. $17,000. Yeah, very deliberate.
[02:47:56.300 --> 02:48:00.300]  As soon as I saw that, the first thing I did is I opened up a tab
[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:04.300]  Tiffany.com and started browsing around and that's how Tiffany charges
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:08.300]  Like if you buy a $17,000 bracelet at Tiffany, it's
[02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:12.300]  $17,000. And every other watch is
[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:16.300]  99900 or 900. Like every other watch they offer
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:20.300]  Apple watches. But the editions are not.
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:24.300]  I should have predicted that. At that level, the unit
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:28.300]  Is not the dollar. The unit is the $1,000. It's how many
[02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:32.300]  And that's just the unit that people who are going to buy that thing in
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:36.300]  But the answer is
[02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:40.300]  He didn't stand in front of a slide with any prices. He just said it. And it was
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:44.300]  I think it was awkward. I think it was terribly awkward.
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:48.300]  You know what would have been better? I mean, I know
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:52.300]  The name edition was supposed to evoke the fact that this was a special edition
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:56.300]  But they should have really just labeled it a special edition
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:49:00.300]  Like we don't know how long we're going to offer it. It's exclusive. It's limited quantities
[02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:04.300]  But we loved the process so much that we had to.
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:08.300]  That's such a brilliant way to put it. That's perfect, Michael. Alright, Matthew.
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:12.300]  We've been podcasting too long. But yeah, I just think it would have sidestepped
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:16.300]  A lot of the issues. That's perfect framing, though. That is absolutely spot on
[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:20.300]  Perfect framing. We loved it so much. We love this material. We wanted
[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:24.300]  To share it with you. And that materials video, if you watch the
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:28.300]  I'm sure you've watched the gold one. I mean, it is insane. They mill it out of a block
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:32.300]  Of gold just like they do the aluminum. Whereas almost all these other watches
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:36.300]  Are cast, I think. But yeah, it's a crazy process. So they should have
[02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:40.300]  Just stood on the process. Which ironically is what they
[02:49:40.300 --> 02:49:44.300]  Did with the MacBook when they went all aluminum
[02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:48.300]  Originally the unibody. They stood on top of the process and said, we're charging
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:52.300]  This much for this thing because look at all this effort we put into it.
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:56.300]  And so they could have done the same thing here. And I think there was a missed opportunity there for them
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:00.300]  Just to say, this is a separate thing. It's
[02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:04.300]  Special. It's expensive. All these other things do the exact
[02:50:04.300 --> 02:50:08.300]  Same thing. But we just wanted you to see this awesome thing we were able to
[02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:12.300]  Construct. And we think you might enjoy it too. And if you do, you can buy it for this much.
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:16.300]  Yeah. And just
[02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:20.300]  The last bit of confusion over this is, he did say it will be
[02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:24.300]  In limited quantities. And then all he said is, it will be
[02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:28.300]  Available in select retail stores. And that's it in terms of
[02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:32.300]  Where. Now we know about these pop-up stores that they're putting in like
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:36.300]  Paris and I think London too that are not
[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:40.300]  Apple stores. They're just going to be like stand-alone boutiques where you're going to buy Apple Watch.
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:44.300]  But no explanation as to what that means. Does that
[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:48.300]  Mean select Apple stores? He didn't say select Apple stores. He said select
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:52.300]  Retail stores. And that's crazy. But it looks like
[02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:56.300]  And then further craziness, it looks like they're going to sell them
[02:50:56.300 --> 02:51:00.300]  Online? Yeah, I mean it says select. They're select
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:04.300]  Buttons, right? When you go to the buy watch by the additions.
[02:51:04.300 --> 02:51:08.300]  So it seems like you could buy them online. So why the select retail
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:12.300]  Stores, right? And my only thought is they have a limited quantity
[02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:16.300]  And they can only allocate. So they're not going to send one watch to every store. Instead
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:20.300]  They're going to send their additions to the store, that store, and this store. So my feeling
[02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:24.300]  On it, and I don't know any about this, but it'll be flagship
[02:51:24.300 --> 02:51:28.300]  Apple stores and then retail partners that are high-end. Like
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:32.300]  Whatever. Not Tiffany's, but those high-end retailers that offer other
[02:51:32.300 --> 02:51:36.300]  Brands goods. Yeah, it's possible.
[02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:40.300]  I doubt that they're going to do it with Tiffany, but Tiffany has sold
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:44.300]  Rolexes in the past. They don't right now. I think the only watches
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:48.300]  You can get at Tiffany are Tiffany ones. But in the past they've had Rolexes. But then
[02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:52.300]  It's like they're stamped on the dial. Like they're, you know, collector's items because
[02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:56.300]  There's a limited number of them. Right, it's a Tiffany's edition Rolex
[02:51:56.300 --> 02:52:00.300]  Or whatever. I wonder too
[02:52:00.300 --> 02:52:04.300]  I wonder too whether addition with these partners, whether
[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:08.300]  There is an as yet undisclosed thing where they will have their own
[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:12.300]  Bands. Like a, like, this is
[02:52:12.300 --> 02:52:16.300]  About Burberry. I don't know, maybe Burberry will sell Apple Watch
[02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:20.300]  Edition in limited locations and you'll be able to get a band that's designed
[02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:24.300]  By Burberry instead of Apple. Wow.
[02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:28.300]  I mean, that would play the exclusivity game even further, right? Yeah, and then
[02:52:28.300 --> 02:52:32.300]  All of a sudden, Tiffany might make sense too, because then maybe Tiffany would do like a Tiffany
[02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:36.300]  Blue leather band or something like that. I mean, I think it's
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:40.300]  Unindubitable, indubitable, whatever.
[02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:44.300]  You can't doubt, I don't know. We have been podcasting for a long time. But I don't
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:48.300]  Think that there's a doubt that anybody, in anybody's mind, that we're going to get third party bands
[02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:52.300]  At some point, right? And there's some question about whether or not there's going to be like an authorization
[02:52:52.300 --> 02:52:56.300]  Program or not or whatever, but we're going to get third party bands and
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:53:00.300]  There's no way we're not going to get high fashion third party brands from say, Burberry or whatever
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:04.300]  But what about in conjunction with the edition? That's not something I thought of. Like what if they
[02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:08.300]  Do say, you can buy it at Tiffany's with the Tiffany band, you can buy it at Burberry
[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:12.300]  Locations with the Burberry band, that kind of thing. Yeah.
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:16.300]  I don't know. I think that's so crazy though, that at the March 9th
[02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:20.300]  I'm not surprised at all that they didn't talk much about it back in September
[02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:24.300]  But I think it's crazy that at this event that they didn't talk about what
[02:53:24.300 --> 02:53:28.300]  Those select retail locations are, because they're not going to have another event before this happens
[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:32.300]  Is this the first Apple product, like not
[02:53:32.300 --> 02:53:36.300]  Accessory, but major product line that you can't buy at every Apple store?
[02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:40.300]  Uh, yes
[02:53:40.300 --> 02:53:44.300]  Because I don't, I can't think of anything and
[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:48.300]  I don't even have like a nagging sensation that I'm forgetting something
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:52.300]  Because they've had special edition iPods and stuff before, but in general those were just available
[02:53:52.300 --> 02:53:56.300]  At whatever stores until they ran out. It wasn't like, oh you can only buy these places
[02:53:56.300 --> 02:54:00.300]  Right, like the U2 iPod or whatever
[02:54:00.300 --> 02:54:04.300]  Yeah, exactly, like oh this store got three of them and then we ran out so we can't reorder
[02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:08.300]  It's not, you were never even offered this. Seems like an interesting
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:12.300]  Precedent to set. Yeah, very weird. I thought it was
[02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:16.300]  Again, the pricing in and of itself doesn't bother me. It doesn't make me fear for
[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:20.300]  The company, but the messaging around the edition is
[02:54:20.300 --> 02:54:24.300]  To me, it just
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:28.300]  Suggests that there's a lot, they don't know much internally, they don't know what to do
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:32.300]  With it either. Yeah, or they're of two minds of what to do
[02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:36.300]  With it. Some people want one thing and other people want another, and the compromise is
[02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:40.300]  Just don't talk about it a whole lot, which is probably not so great
[02:54:40.300 --> 02:54:44.300]  But it lends credence to the idea that this is Johnny Ives
[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:48.300]  Driven, and not something that's coming from the
[02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:52.300]  Central core of the company, I don't know. I'll be very interested to see
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:56.300]  How this plays out. Alright, well let's wrap it up
[02:54:56.300 --> 02:55:00.300]  I can't think of anything else. Oh, one thing I will mention, just an
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:04.300]  Aside, we probably don't need to dissect it a whole lot, but I think people are going to be really surprised
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:08.300]  How much they use the crown. Oh, definitely. Versus the screen
[02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:12.300]  I mean, there's a couple of reasons, but the crown is matched to the scrolling rate of the screen extremely
[02:55:12.300 --> 02:55:16.300]  Well, so it feels like, you know, it's natural how much it accelerates
[02:55:16.300 --> 02:55:20.300]  And when it stops, the crown is, they match that really well, which is what
[02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:24.300]  Apple does, so I'm not too surprised, I'm not shocked, but there's
[02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:28.300]  Also the fact that when your finger's on the screen, you're covering some of the screen
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:32.300]  So you're missing some of the data on a very small screen already, which is why I think the whole
[02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:36.300]  Crown thing, you know, executes well. So I think that's going to be
[02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:40.300]  A big, I think it's going to be, as I talked to a lot of people who were like, oh, I'm just going to, you know, I never thought
[02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:44.300]  That I'd use the crown, I'm just going to scroll on the screen, but then they go, oh
[02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:48.300]  The crown actually is really attractive for these reasons
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:52.300]  Yeah, I've heard the same thing from people who've been, you know, Apple friends
[02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:56.300]  Who've been testing it, that it's totally, totally legit
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:00.300]  You know, definitely a core part of it. I've said this numerous times, but I
[02:56:00.300 --> 02:56:04.300]  Keep getting questions, so I might as well answer it again, is that, what do you do
[02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:08.300]  If you're left-handed? You turn the watch, you take the straps off, put the strap, the bottom strap on the top
[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:12.300]  And the top strap on the bottom, and then you put it on your other wrist, and then your crown
[02:56:12.300 --> 02:56:16.300]  Is beneath the communication button. You just turn the watch upside down
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:20.300]  But it's like these, it's probably the most frequently
[02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:24.300]  Asked question I've gotten in the last three days. Yeah, and because it's muscle memory and you're
[02:56:24.300 --> 02:56:28.300]  Left-handed, you're always going to be reaching for the same button in the same location, so it's not like
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:32.300]  It's going to throw you, that's just how you use your watch
[02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:36.300]  Yeah, did you, I see some funny things, they say that they tightened up
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:40.300]  The feel of the crown, I thought the crown felt great in September
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:42.300]  I can't even imagine if they've changed it, how much better
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:46.300]  Yeah, I mean that's what I had heard, but the crown that I used felt nice and tight
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:50.300]  But it's been so long since September that I can't really tell, you know
[02:56:50.300 --> 02:56:54.300]  Unfortunately that's one of those things where we won't, I don't know if we'll ever have empirical evidence
[02:56:54.300 --> 02:56:58.300]  Right, but I'm not surprised. It feels good. Yeah, no, because it's been a long time
[02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:02.300]  And I'm sure that, you know, I do, I think it's so central to their concept
[02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:06.300]  Of how people will use it, that the attention that they've poured into it is just
[02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:10.300]  Incredible. Yeah, they fine-tune it right down to the last second before they commit
[02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:14.300]  So, Matthew Panzarino, people who can read
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:18.300]  Your work, your fine work at TechCrunch where you
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:22.300]  Write way more frequently than I do
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:26.300]  But you do a great job, and on Twitter, your username
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:30.300]  Is at panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:34.300]  Anything else you want to pitch? No, not really
[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:38.300]  No, I'm not a very pitchy kind of person
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.300]  Thank you for your time recording this show, thank you even more
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:46.300]  For your attention during the event on Monday being my go-to
[02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:50.300]  Let me text you questions. My pleasure, anytime
[02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:54.300]  And thanks for having me, appreciate it. Alright, I'll talk to you soon
[02:57:54.300 --> 02:58:22.300]  Okay, peace. Alright, I'm hitting stop.
