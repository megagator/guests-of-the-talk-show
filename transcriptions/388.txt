[00:00.000 --> 00:02.120]  Well, we finally got space black, Christina.
[00:02.360 --> 00:07.480]  I mean, I'm both really excited. And I'm also very upset for my
[00:07.480 --> 00:10.720]  wallet because I've made comments on Twitter and Mastodon. I was
[00:10.720 --> 00:14.340]  like, if they come out with another black laptop, I'm going
[00:14.340 --> 00:18.680]  to buy it no matter what. And now I feel compelled even though
[00:18.720 --> 00:24.680]  my two year old 14 inch M1 Max with 64 gigs of RAM has an
[00:24.680 --> 00:27.960]  abysmal resale value and no real need to upgrade.
[00:27.960 --> 00:32.960]  Wait, wait, I have the exact same machine. I have an M1 14
[00:32.960 --> 00:39.720]  inch MacBook Pro that is maxed out at 64 gigs of RAM, which now
[00:39.720 --> 00:44.680]  sounds terribly piddly. Right. And you're saying we're going to
[00:44.680 --> 00:46.560]  get terrible resale value for it.
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.160]  Is that what you're saying? Yes. Yeah. So Apple is offering a
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.160]  whopping $1,300 for trade in. And I'm guessing I can probably
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.080]  maybe max out at 1617. And then the 128 gigabyte model with tax
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.720]  and Apple care and tax in my state is 10% is six grand. So
[01:06.720 --> 01:09.480]  congratulations, Apple, you're probably going to get a ton of
[01:09.480 --> 01:12.920]  money out of me for a freaking color. You have my number.
[01:13.040 --> 01:20.240]  So I never had to leave the Northeast corridor. I'm not it
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.440]  is very strange. I had a meta level here. I'm not quite sure
[01:24.440 --> 01:27.280]  what the rules are. There's off the record. And I know what that
[01:27.280 --> 01:31.000]  means. And it's just sort of like a friendly handshake that
[01:31.600 --> 01:34.720]  we're not supposed to talk about the details of it. But a bunch
[01:34.720 --> 01:38.880]  of media people were invited to New York this morning. Yeah. So
[01:38.880 --> 01:43.360]  I do have literal actual hands on experience with these
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.440]  devices, which is important when we get the fingerprint stuff.
[01:46.760 --> 01:49.760]  But they're like, but we want to focus on the news. So don't talk
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.960]  about the venue. And it's a All right. All right. But you're
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.120]  supposed to I forget they have like a suggested phrasing. It's
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.400]  like I've, I've had early access to something, something, blah,
[01:59.400 --> 02:05.720]  blah, blah. But was it at the addition? No. Okay. It was at
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.160]  the usual place where we're not supposed to talk about. But I
[02:10.160 --> 02:13.960]  will say this, I came back and I checked with my son who's now a
[02:13.960 --> 02:20.800]  sophomore in college has a touch bar m one Mac. Oh, man, bro. And
[02:20.800 --> 02:26.560]  I'm like, Would you like a hand me down m one? Yeah. No, this is
[02:26.560 --> 02:29.800]  the thing. He's gonna get a huge upgrade because he'll be able to
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.040]  use it with more than one monitor. He'll have like actual
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.360]  RAM in it. Like it'll actually perform well. That's the that's
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.520]  the interesting thing. Now, at your briefing that we're not
[02:39.520 --> 02:41.640]  supposed to talk about at the usual place in the Lower East
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.000]  Side. We're where Yeah, I know that they met with some people
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.040]  and they're having briefings tomorrow as well. I guess
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.480]  Tuesday, from what I understand as well. I'm not beholden to any
[02:50.480 --> 02:53.080]  of these rules. So I can talk about it. Did they confirm that
[02:53.080 --> 02:57.120]  the 13 inch touch bar is dead? The complete piece of shit
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.320]  garbage machine that we all hated? Is that is that dead now?
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.280]  Yes. But yes, it was in in the most awkward way possible, which
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.000]  is to me very funny. Because when and I will say this too,
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.920]  they did not show us the video that the broadcast video of the
[03:15.920 --> 03:22.400]  keynote beforehand. Instead, we got a sort of bespoke in person
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.760]  keynote, which I'm not complaining because I got two
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.080]  presentations. I got an old fashioned live one live keynote
[03:31.080 --> 03:34.440]  slide presentation and then got to watch this with everybody
[03:34.440 --> 03:37.600]  else from the comfort of my living room at 8pm Eastern five
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.520]  Pacific. But they didn't mention it in the presentation. They
[03:42.520 --> 03:46.520]  didn't say this that that 13 inch touch bar thing is gone.
[03:46.960 --> 03:53.560]  But I did note when they said the new M three, no adjective
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.000]  MacBook Pro starts at 1599. It put I was like, I think this
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.560]  kills that machine that cursed that cursed machine awful
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.440]  machine, but that cursed machine started at 1299. And then it in
[04:09.440 --> 04:11.640]  question when they started taking questions from people,
[04:11.640 --> 04:16.720]  somebody else in the media asked. And I think they answered
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.360]  poorly. I'll answer the way they that I think they should have
[04:20.360 --> 04:23.240]  answered, which is that machine is no longer for sale as of
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.320]  today. It was a good machine for these reasons, blah, blah, blah,
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.240]  and people loved it. But instead, they answered by
[04:31.240 --> 04:35.040]  starting by talking about how great a machine that was. And I
[04:35.040 --> 04:38.480]  thought, Oh, God, oh, it's still here.
[04:38.480 --> 04:41.800]  Right, right. And it's, it's so dumb, because you're right, they
[04:41.800 --> 04:44.600]  could have said this no longer for sale. Because you guys like
[04:44.600 --> 04:47.920]  you have a 15 inch MacBook Air and 13 inch MacBook Air, which
[04:47.920 --> 04:51.840]  are superior in basically every way. Like, for years, we've been
[04:51.840 --> 04:55.080]  talking about why that machine didn't need to exist. Granted,
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.760]  this is starting out with we can talk about the fact that I think
[04:58.760 --> 05:01.520]  it's insulting that that the base model still is eight gigs
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.560]  of RAM. Yes, yes, you're you're hitting key points that I want
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.840]  to bring up. That is, I would say the one of the very few this
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.920]  is a very good news day for Mac fans. I think it is super good
[05:14.920 --> 05:17.880]  overall. But as always, there's something we can find to
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.760]  complain about, I would say base models starting at eight, I'll
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.520]  even forgive the 24 inch iMac. Although, given the way they
[05:27.520 --> 05:33.760]  make Apple Silicon, I guess if the base M three chip has eight
[05:33.760 --> 05:36.440]  gigabytes, they're going to put it in some of the laptops, I
[05:36.440 --> 05:39.840]  kind of feel though, that should not be in a machine called
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.160]  MacBook Pro. If it has the word pro in it at in 2023. There's
[05:44.160 --> 05:49.000]  absolutely no reason now. Does that mean if they had followed
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.360]  your your in my advice, and they should not sell a MacBook Pro
[05:54.400 --> 05:58.800]  with only eight gigabytes of RAM at the end of 2023, that the
[05:58.800 --> 06:01.680]  starting price would be higher again, now we're spending Tim
[06:01.680 --> 06:05.200]  Cook's money. But still, it did that. That should not happen.
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.280]  Yeah. And look, Tim Cook has plenty of money. Like, like, we
[06:09.280 --> 06:12.040]  can be we can be honest about that. And it's also I mean, we
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.440]  put them in a weird position. But I'm just, yeah, starting
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.360]  with eight gigabytes, especially 1600 dollars. That's that feels
[06:19.360 --> 06:20.040]  egregious.
[06:20.200 --> 06:23.640]  Yeah, I friend of the show friend of everybody's friend of
[06:23.640 --> 06:27.200]  the internet, Jason Snell was I saw him today. He was here in
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.360]  California. We had lunch. And I said to him as we were
[06:30.360 --> 06:35.120]  launching, I was so glad that both he and I spent some finger
[06:35.120 --> 06:39.760]  energy last week complaining about the incoherence of the
[06:39.760 --> 06:44.400]  iPad. Yeah. And up overall, in the context of this new Apple
[06:44.400 --> 06:47.320]  pencil, which you and I don't have to talk about. It is now
[06:47.320 --> 06:47.680]  there's
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.880]  Yeah, but now you've got this complicated conspiracy theorist
[06:54.040 --> 06:58.840]  cork board strings of yarn and and thumbtacks all over the
[06:58.840 --> 07:04.880]  place to figure out which pencil works with which iPad. But I'm
[07:04.880 --> 07:07.720]  glad we complained about the incoherence of the iPad lineup
[07:07.720 --> 07:12.560]  last week, because I feel like now, we can praise Apple for
[07:12.560 --> 07:16.280]  the, in my opinion, complete coherence of the MacBook
[07:16.280 --> 07:19.960]  lineup. So that would be my number one takeaway of the day,
[07:20.360 --> 07:26.400]  is now that the M3 is here, and the touch bar, quote unquote,
[07:26.400 --> 07:32.840]  MacBook Pro is gone. It is very coherent 998 99 for education,
[07:32.840 --> 07:37.440]  you you get the old M1, which is old now it's three years old
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.040]  industrial design from the Intel era MacBook Air. And yes, that
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.000]  is the worst MacBook you can buy. But it's pretty good. It's
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.800]  sub and everybody knows why it only has the M1 and why it has
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.440]  the old industrial design. It is there to be lower the lowest
[07:53.440 --> 08:00.480]  price MacBook fair, then M2 MacBook Airs, which the integer
[08:00.480 --> 08:05.160]  two is less than three. So they're older than the pros,
[08:05.160 --> 08:09.000]  right. And they're they're very compelling machines. The 15
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.520]  inch is only what five months old, four months old from
[08:12.520 --> 08:16.600]  WWDC. Very nice form factor, great form factor, great
[08:16.600 --> 08:21.320]  performance, nice screens for consumer laptops. And they fill
[08:21.320 --> 08:25.880]  these price ranges up to around 1500. And then starting at 1600
[08:25.880 --> 08:31.480]  now there's the M3 14 inch MacBook Pro and onward from
[08:31.480 --> 08:35.560]  there. And despite as everybody knows significant inflation
[08:35.560 --> 08:40.200]  worldwide over the last few years, the starting point for
[08:40.200 --> 08:44.640]  the ones with the the 14 inch and the 16 inch are still for
[08:44.640 --> 08:48.800]  the ones with the M3 Pro chip and the only one with that are
[08:48.800 --> 08:54.880]  16 inch and up or 16 inch size. Prices stay the same 1999 for
[08:54.880 --> 09:00.200]  14 inch and 2499 for 16 inch. So if anything, when you consider
[09:00.200 --> 09:02.040]  inflation prices have come down.
[09:02.360 --> 09:07.880]  Yeah, which I mean, is fair, I think because look, we can they
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.640]  Apple can talk all day one about how much better these chips are
[09:10.640 --> 09:14.000]  than the past chips. But the fact of the matter is, is that
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.760]  typically prices do come down, regardless of inflation, right?
[09:17.760 --> 09:20.200]  Like you get better yields, you're able to do this more,
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.400]  they're reusing the bulk of the chassis, the keyboard, the
[09:24.440 --> 09:27.600]  heating pipes, I mean, the chips are new, but everything else is
[09:27.600 --> 09:30.320]  something that they already have had in there, which we'll call
[09:30.320 --> 09:33.320]  it not supply chain, there are assembly lines, right? So it's
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.040]  not as if like they've amortized the costs of so much of this
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.720]  machine. So other than the new color, but everything else,
[09:40.720 --> 09:44.160]  they've, they've amortized the cost. So I, I will give them a
[09:44.160 --> 09:46.120]  little bit of kudos for that. But I'm not gonna like go out of
[09:46.120 --> 09:49.960]  my way. Just because I feel like that's, you know, I'm glad the
[09:49.960 --> 09:52.880]  price didn't go up. If the price had gone up, I would be angry.
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.160]  But I'm, I'm happy that it didn't.
[09:56.640 --> 09:59.560]  So there still is a black tax.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.440]  Yes, I love this.
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.400]  The sort of replacement for the touch bar 13 inch MacBook Pro
[10:06.400 --> 10:14.680]  is this 1599 no pro in the name regular m3 chip MacBook Pro. And
[10:14.760 --> 10:18.560]  it it does have this, I think it's a great machine. And it's
[10:18.560 --> 10:22.320]  such a better replacement to sort of fill that halfway
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.040]  between 1000 and $2,000 price range. And I'm like, as certain
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.880]  as I can be without even off the record, no one from Apple is
[10:30.880 --> 10:33.440]  ever going to say to me, yes, that's why we kept that damn
[10:33.440 --> 10:37.160]  machine around. But nobody ever told me I'm wrong. It's
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.520]  basically because there's some number of people, right? Either
[10:40.520 --> 10:44.400]  they are consumers, and let's face it, they're probably men. I
[10:44.400 --> 10:48.080]  mean, let's definitely men, they are absolutely men, and and or
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.440]  IT departments buying for a fleet. And again, probably men
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.720]  who are like, are people or me personally, me tough guy, we need
[10:56.720 --> 10:59.720]  a pro, I need a pro, I need a machine with pro. And they're
[10:59.720 --> 11:02.720]  like, Okay, if you really want one with pro, and you don't want
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.320]  to spend $2,000 or up, here you go. Here's the thing. And that
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.360]  was it. Now, there's a really that's a it's a credible, good,
[11:11.400 --> 11:15.360]  cool machine. Yeah, but you can't get it in space black,
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.200]  silver or space gray, which are which are the unchanged colors
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.280]  from previous generations. If you want space black, then
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.120]  you've got to upgrade to the $2,000 and up models, right?
[11:28.440 --> 11:31.760]  No, what is interesting is that the base model 14 inch on the
[11:31.760 --> 11:35.640]  has two Thunderbolt three ports, rather than three. But of course
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.240]  it does still have like the HDMI and the SDXC. So it is similar.
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.640]  Most people, I would argue, if you're looking at a MacBook Air,
[11:45.800 --> 11:48.600]  a 15 inch MacBook Air, I think if you were to price that out to
[11:48.600 --> 11:51.920]  be the $1,600, I think is probably going to give you more
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.040]  bang for your buck, in my opinion, than what you would get
[11:55.040 --> 11:59.840]  with that base level M3, in my opinion, but just because you're
[11:59.840 --> 12:01.800]  going to be able to get more RAM in it, which I think is going to
[12:01.800 --> 12:05.720]  matter more than the chip difference, just just candidly.
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.800]  But to your point, I do think that this is going to go after
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.480]  that segment of people who want to the pro for whatever reason.
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.000]  And I think that when we look at like what they do with the line
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.120]  going forward, I think that this is a really good place for them
[12:20.120 --> 12:23.000]  to have kind of that tiered system of saying, Okay, this is
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.360]  what we have for the MacBook Airs, the 13 and the 15. And
[12:26.360 --> 12:29.840]  then we have these three models for people who for whatever
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.480]  reason, want some of those differences. And so I feel like
[12:33.520 --> 12:36.480]  before and I think I said this in the last two or three years
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.360]  of Jason Snell's Apple report card, I complained about the
[12:40.360 --> 12:43.520]  the Touch Bar Mac still existing, because it just made
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.960]  no sense to me. It was like one of those things. I was like, you
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.240]  either need to just spend the money and get a 14 inch or you
[12:49.760 --> 12:52.960]  are going to be completely very, very well off with the MacBook
[12:52.960 --> 12:56.440]  Air, especially the redesigned MacBook Airs that came out in
[12:56.480 --> 13:00.600]  2022. And of course, now the new 15 inch. But I feel like at this
[13:00.600 --> 13:05.120]  point, there is enough of a differentiation, where you could
[13:05.120 --> 13:07.320]  make that argument for some people if they wanted that 14
[13:07.320 --> 13:11.000]  inch for whatever reason, that I feel like the line makes sense
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.680]  in a way that that it didn't before and certainly in a way
[13:13.680 --> 13:18.000]  that the iPad does not. And so hopefully the iPad, maybe in a
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.440]  year will finally be there with the iPad.
[13:20.440 --> 13:24.040]  I do think you're right that for most people buying for
[13:24.040 --> 13:28.840]  themselves, your and your budget is around 1600. I think you're
[13:28.840 --> 13:34.480]  probably better off getting an M2 MacBook Air and upgrading to
[13:34.480 --> 13:40.480]  1600 then starting with the baseline MacBook Pro. But if
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.560]  that's what you want, you're getting you, I you can't say, I
[13:44.560 --> 13:49.200]  would not recommend that machine in the way that anybody like
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.120]  I'm sure every single person who listens to my podcast has is the
[13:53.120 --> 13:56.240]  sort of person who's informed enough to know that if somebody
[13:56.240 --> 13:59.440]  they know was tempted to buy the touch bar MacBook Pro, they
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.400]  would try to talk that person out of it and say no, buy
[14:03.400 --> 14:07.080]  something else buy the Mac, but you should get the M2 Air. It is
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.840]  great. No, it's Air not Pro. But seriously, it's awesome machine.
[14:10.880 --> 14:13.680]  Yeah, you should get it. I did not know about the ports. It's
[14:13.680 --> 14:16.800]  all I'm still figuring out some of these details. It's kind of
[14:16.800 --> 14:20.080]  interesting. And it's kind of interesting to me, because it
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.120]  says to me, they did some or a fair amount of custom
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.000]  engineering just to make this machine.
[14:26.160 --> 14:29.360]  Yeah, no, that's a good point. And I think to me, what it also
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.160]  kind of screams to me is going, okay, they very clearly wanted
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.120]  to still have a differentiation between the $2,000 model for the
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.800]  Pro, which I think is really what they consider the MacBook
[14:40.800 --> 14:47.120]  Pro, which is fine. And in kind of this kind of, like havsy, this
[14:47.160 --> 14:50.880]  this bow, I guess we can call it this bow Pro, but but I mean,
[14:50.880 --> 14:54.280]  because it still has it has 200 volt ports, but it still has the
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.320]  HDMI, which the air doesn't have it has the XC, it has the mag
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.960]  safe. And so
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.840]  it has the great speaker system, which really is impressive. It
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.040]  is it really has the same display with the same number of
[15:08.040 --> 15:13.040]  nits for both SDR content and which is up from 500 to 600
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.440]  nits. So significant 21.2 x brighter. Yeah, the same 60. It's
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.560]  the same display, which is great. Great. I think that's
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.160]  neat. I didn't think of it, I bet that it has the same
[15:26.160 --> 15:30.520]  brightness capabilities as the studio displays. So if you're
[15:30.520 --> 15:33.440]  going to run it side by side with the studio display, you're
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.400]  going to get same levels of brightness on both of them. And
[15:37.400 --> 15:43.240]  then that's great. I and I will say that before I forget before
[15:43.240 --> 15:45.240]  we move on, I got to talk about the fingerprint thing.
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.760]  Yes, I want to hear your impressions on this because this
[15:47.760 --> 15:50.720]  is very important. This is gonna make a break it for the for the
[15:50.720 --> 15:51.120]  color.
[15:51.200 --> 15:55.520]  I think it's no no bullshit. I think they've invented some kind
[15:55.520 --> 15:58.320]  of I think when they say that they've got some blah, blah,
[15:58.320 --> 16:05.040]  blah industry first coding. Yes, I think so. Because when I was
[16:05.040 --> 16:08.680]  there, it was it was not a particularly warm day, but it
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.200]  was like humid in New York. And I have sort of vaguely sweaty
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.120]  hands, not enough that it'd be great. It's ever grew, I think I
[16:16.120 --> 16:20.080]  hope never gross to shake my hand. But you know, I tend to
[16:20.120 --> 16:25.920]  just moist hands. I was there touching it trying to put
[16:25.920 --> 16:29.200]  fingerprints on it and couldn't do it. I there's something I
[16:29.200 --> 16:32.880]  think I'm pretty in a way that I know would have left a
[16:32.880 --> 16:37.880]  fingerprint on the midnight m2 MacBook Air. And then I closed
[16:37.880 --> 16:41.920]  the lid and put my index finger on the glossy Apple logo and it
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.400]  immediately left a crystal clear fingerprint. And of course, like
[16:46.400 --> 16:49.760]  anytime you're in Apple's presence for a media event,
[16:49.760 --> 16:52.440]  there's people watching and as soon as I did it, somebody was
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.160]  there to say there's no coding on the glossy Apple logo because
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.240]  we want it to look polished. So you will be able to leave
[17:01.240 --> 17:04.520]  fingerprints on the Apple logo if you want. But I do think that
[17:04.520 --> 17:08.320]  they are they really do have something going on with the
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.960]  anti fingerprint coding. It was funny. I don't think I'm
[17:11.960 --> 17:14.480]  supposed to say this, but it's a podcast, not an article. So
[17:14.480 --> 17:18.240]  screw it. I'll say it. Somebody else in my media group asked,
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.320]  Have you heard complaints from people with the midnight m2
[17:22.360 --> 17:28.760]  MacBook Air about fingerprints? And the answer was, we're very
[17:28.760 --> 17:34.640]  happy with the new coding on the space M3 MacBook pros. That's a
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.600]  great answer that and that tells you if you've ever you know
[17:38.600 --> 17:41.960]  this, you know, but it is that if you're ever curious what it's
[17:41.960 --> 17:45.560]  like talking to people in Apple product marketing, that question
[17:45.560 --> 17:51.000]  and answer was absolutely positively exemplary as this is
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.760]  how they answer questions they don't want to answer. Yes. And
[17:53.760 --> 17:56.320]  that is also like a great answer. Because as you said, that
[17:56.320 --> 17:59.320]  is the perfect Apple product marketing answer. And it is also
[17:59.440 --> 18:02.280]  affirmatively saying, Yes, we have definitely been hearing
[18:02.280 --> 18:05.160]  complaints. No, we will not comment on it. But we are very
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.280]  happy with this new one, which great answer like I so that's
[18:09.400 --> 18:14.120]  that's really good to know my probably my favorite laptop ever
[18:14.120 --> 18:18.800]  up until the the current 14 inch laptops and the 16 is true, but I
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.720]  really love the 14 inch form factor was that original Intel
[18:22.720 --> 18:28.320]  black MacBook. I for whatever reason, I love love love that
[18:28.320 --> 18:32.840]  laptop. And so I'm very happy that we have like, it feels like
[18:32.840 --> 18:37.280]  an adult version of that, like years later. And and so like I
[18:37.280 --> 18:41.480]  still have my my 2007 black book that I named Simon because it
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.200]  was inadvertently paid for by Simon Cowell. So and he wore a
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.760]  black t shirt. So it's the whole thing fit. But I love that
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.040]  laptop. And I'm very glad that we have a new one.
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.360]  I don't think I can let that slide without asking for a
[18:54.360 --> 18:55.560]  follow. Oh, yeah.
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.080]  So I was in college. And I want to because of being a blog
[19:00.080 --> 19:03.760]  commenter, of all things, I would comment on the then music
[19:03.760 --> 19:06.640]  editor of USA today's music blog. And he also had an
[19:06.640 --> 19:09.720]  American Idol blog. And that was like my secret shame slash
[19:09.720 --> 19:12.560]  guilty pleasure. And I would comment on both of those blogs,
[19:12.560 --> 19:15.520]  and he really likes my remarks. And so they asked me to
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.560]  contribute to the print and the online section of the paper
[19:19.560 --> 19:22.120]  about American Idol, it was me and like three people that
[19:22.120 --> 19:24.680]  actually knew what they were talking about, giving advice to
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.200]  the contestants each week, they paid me $1,500. And I used that
[19:29.320 --> 19:31.000]  to buy that black MacBook.
[19:31.160 --> 19:35.520]  Yeah. So unlike that one, which I think, as if I recall
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.480]  correctly, you got nothing except the better color for $200.
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.840]  It was that and it was it was a $50 difference if you got the
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.680]  right amount of hard disk size. So I think the base or so it was
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.200]  like the it was the faster processor, and it had 160
[19:52.200 --> 19:56.120]  gigabyte hard drive, whereas the white one was 120 gigabytes.
[19:56.160 --> 19:59.800]  But if you custom ordered the white one, and like you gave it
[19:59.800 --> 20:03.000]  the faster processor and gave it the bigger hard drive, it was a
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.680]  $50 black tax, which, you know, like it, which is where we're
[20:07.680 --> 20:11.120]  back. And it was for me, I remember like convincing my mom
[20:11.120 --> 20:13.960]  because she had to help me with a little bit of it. And and I
[20:13.960 --> 20:16.840]  was like, No, I have to have the black one. I was like, this is
[20:16.840 --> 20:18.920]  very important to me. I have to have the black MacBook.
[20:19.080 --> 20:24.240]  So finally, on that I have to admit, I'm amused by the fact I
[20:24.240 --> 20:28.760]  guess if my budget were 1600 dollars, I'd be Well, actually,
[20:28.760 --> 20:32.360]  I think I agree with you. If my budget capped at 1600, I would
[20:32.360 --> 20:37.200]  just get the midnight. Yeah, to MacBook Air. I'm very happy
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.440]  about this color. I'm very unhappy about the fact that I'm
[20:40.440 --> 20:44.800]  so upset. I've just spent I mean, let me look at the time
[20:44.800 --> 20:50.880]  here. I first saw it. I guess 11 hours ago. So I've spent 11
[20:50.880 --> 20:53.680]  hours thinking don't I don't need this. I don't need this. I
[20:53.680 --> 20:57.640]  don't need this. And I really do. You have to guide but also
[20:57.640 --> 20:59.960]  it's gonna be great for your son because he doesn't need he
[20:59.960 --> 21:02.480]  really doesn't need an upgraded machine, right? Like he's in his
[21:02.480 --> 21:05.880]  sophomore year of college. He needs this because it's not as
[21:05.880 --> 21:09.880]  if everything he does isn't web based. No, not at all. No, he
[21:09.880 --> 21:12.040]  doesn't need a glorified Chromebook. He needs a really
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.880]  powerful machine with 32 cores and 64 gigs of RAM. I can't I
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.520]  feel bad too. Because when they talk about the reasons for each
[21:20.520 --> 21:23.480]  step up in the line, why you might need this, and they're
[21:23.480 --> 21:25.760]  like, this would be great for video pros. And this is great
[21:25.760 --> 21:28.320]  for people who work in 3d. And this is great for and then you
[21:28.320 --> 21:32.800]  get say AI and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, what about web
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.520]  browser tab hoarders? Like me? Exactly. Same. I mean, I do I do
[21:37.520 --> 21:40.920]  some video work. And I do do a certain amount of kind of AI
[21:40.920 --> 21:44.600]  stuff. Unfortunately, I mean, the AI thing. That's an
[21:44.600 --> 21:47.880]  interesting conversation, because most of the models are
[21:47.880 --> 21:52.160]  still primarily made for Nvidia GPUs. And and they work better
[21:52.160 --> 21:54.280]  that way. So it's one of those weird things where like, I have
[21:54.280 --> 21:57.280]  my gaming PC that I built a few years ago, that like that
[21:57.280 --> 22:00.120]  actually works considerably better for running any of the
[22:00.120 --> 22:04.240]  stable diffusion or any of the other kind of open source AI
[22:04.240 --> 22:08.120]  models than my MacBook. But I will say Apple, they have their
[22:08.120 --> 22:11.720]  own forks of some of those things they've been optimizing
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.560]  for those things. And with any luck, I'm sure that Apple has
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.880]  its own LLM with any luck, they will in the next year or so have
[22:19.880 --> 22:24.960]  something that people can can run themselves to and this is by
[22:24.960 --> 22:27.080]  all accounts, I mean, it's not going to be as good as a
[22:27.080 --> 22:30.640]  standalone machine with a discrete GPU, but the graphs
[22:30.640 --> 22:33.280]  looks good. I don't know. I mean, you will have to wait for
[22:33.280 --> 22:36.920]  the actual full reviews, but the graphs certainly looks good. And
[22:36.920 --> 22:40.080]  so I'm not, I'm I'm not mad at it. But I'm also gonna be
[22:40.080 --> 22:43.360]  completely candid, like my whole thing is I'm the tab hoarder,
[22:43.400 --> 22:46.800]  what browser person. And I'm like, No, but it's black. And it
[22:46.800 --> 22:48.920]  looks really good. And I want it.
[22:49.120 --> 22:54.000]  I really have to say I have to admit this was it. It was true
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.880]  for me before I got this one. It was it's been true for me
[22:56.880 --> 22:59.280]  throughout the Apple Silicon era, once we got to Apple
[22:59.280 --> 23:06.160]  Silicon, for what I do with a Mac, performance wise, I can't
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.280]  notice a difference with anything. RAM matters to me. And
[23:10.280 --> 23:13.520]  the RAM is mostly about my the fact that I love to keep all my
[23:13.520 --> 23:16.680]  apps open at once. And the one that really takes up all the RAM
[23:16.680 --> 23:20.640]  is Safari, because I have, and I'm not exaggerating all usually
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.480]  hundreds of tabs open across two dozen windows, until I once a
[23:25.480 --> 23:29.480]  month do like, okay, bookmark anything worth bookmarking and
[23:29.480 --> 23:31.960]  start all over. And then by the end of the next month, I'm back
[23:31.960 --> 23:35.440]  up to 400 and some open tabs. But you know, that's the way I
[23:35.440 --> 23:38.400]  like to work. I do. And I love having them all open. I need the
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.440]  RAM for it. But at this point, now I'm worried because the
[23:41.440 --> 23:47.320]  other thing about my M one MacBook Pro with 64 gigs of RAM
[23:47.320 --> 23:51.280]  exactly like yours, is I check every once in a while. And I
[23:51.280 --> 23:54.360]  never have almost ever I think in the I don't know how long
[23:54.360 --> 23:56.960]  I've been using this machine. Well, over a year, well over a
[23:56.960 --> 24:01.040]  year at this point, I think I've only noticed swap virtual
[24:01.040 --> 24:05.720]  memory one time ever, you know, that I've gone past. So I can't
[24:05.720 --> 24:10.160]  really justify 128 gigabytes of RAM. But yeah,
[24:10.200 --> 24:14.320]  but if you're gonna buy it, you have to like to me, I'm going to
[24:14.720 --> 24:17.640]  like I'm in a similar situation where I'm like, okay, I don't
[24:17.640 --> 24:22.120]  actually because I have my work machine has only 32 gigs of RAM.
[24:22.160 --> 24:25.480]  And that is only because those were the only ones that we could
[24:25.480 --> 24:28.320]  get like they were so supply constrained that I could only
[24:28.320 --> 24:32.600]  get like a 16 inch in one pro with 32 gigs of RAM. And I was
[24:32.600 --> 24:35.080]  lucky to get that when I was able to get it because some
[24:35.080 --> 24:38.080]  people had to wait like months to get laptops and had to like
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.120]  make do with MacBook Air's like animals. And even on that
[24:42.120 --> 24:47.080]  machine, which I do a lot of stuff on, like I very rarely run
[24:47.080 --> 24:49.920]  into any sort of swap at all. And I have to be honest with
[24:49.920 --> 24:52.080]  myself, I'm like, I really don't notice any difference between
[24:52.080 --> 24:55.720]  the performance between the two at all. But if I'm going to
[24:55.720 --> 25:00.880]  spend the money, like I'm, I'm a ram whore, and I'm, you can
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.000]  call me a size queen, whatever. But like, I'm going to need 128
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.040]  gigs of RAM. Like, that's what I'm going to need on that
[25:06.040 --> 25:07.680]  machine, whether I'm going to use it or not.
[25:07.840 --> 25:09.840]  Well, and the other reason I feel like you and I can both
[25:09.840 --> 25:16.520]  justify it is if we buy now, I think that I think it was like
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.760]  18 months from m one to m two and 16 months from the beginning
[25:20.760 --> 25:24.000]  of m two now to m three, it's roughly a year and a half.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.760]  Let's say they keep going, it's going to be close to a year and
[25:26.760 --> 25:32.440]  a half before m four is even right bird by now. And I would
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.880]  say within a year, most websites will be coded worse, take up
[25:36.880 --> 25:38.680]  more, take up more memory.
[25:39.320 --> 25:42.200]  No, no, you're right. And and with any luck, I mean, I don't
[25:42.200 --> 25:45.200]  know what the architecture looks like yet. I'm hoping that the
[25:45.200 --> 25:48.520]  virtual that will finally get nested virtualization support.
[25:48.760 --> 25:51.720]  Because if that happens, then that right easier for things
[25:51.720 --> 25:54.920]  like Docker and other containerized tools, which is
[25:54.920 --> 25:58.360]  one of the reasons I still have an Intel iMac is for a lot of
[25:58.360 --> 26:02.120]  the Docker stuff I have to do is just runs better on Intel, or I
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.560]  use a cloud machine. And I would love to not have to do that. And
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.520]  in that case, honestly, like, putting aside the AI of it all,
[26:09.520 --> 26:12.480]  like that's where area where I could, if I had can have a bunch
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.120]  of VMs running, shoot, like I can, I can go through 128 gigs
[26:17.120 --> 26:22.200]  of RAM, like quick and and be very happy to so. So I think
[26:22.200 --> 26:26.160]  you're right. A, the the websites will be coded worse. So
[26:26.160 --> 26:28.680]  we'll have that going for us. But be for some of the nerdier
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.280]  pursuits that we will usually take on. There will be I think,
[26:32.280 --> 26:34.400]  to your point, like this is one of those things where I was
[26:34.400 --> 26:38.200]  really glad that I bought the M one basically, like the max,
[26:38.200 --> 26:42.200]  like as soon as it was released. And even though I'm mad at my
[26:42.200 --> 26:47.320]  resale value, I'm also not that mad because it's this is this is
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.840]  like a luxury that I can talk about replacing a laptop I don't
[26:50.840 --> 26:53.880]  need to replace, because it's been a great laptop. And I'm
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.320]  like, you know what, I'm not at all mad if I buy and go all in
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.200]  on like the highest end one again. And and if it's only two
[27:02.200 --> 27:04.800]  more years, then I can sell still like be like, well, this
[27:04.800 --> 27:06.400]  was a really great laptop for two years.
[27:06.440 --> 27:08.920]  Yeah, before we leave the point, I do think though, it
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.640]  exemplifies the fact that you can now buy a MacBook Pro that
[27:13.640 --> 27:16.360]  goes up to 128 gigabytes of RAM.
[27:16.400 --> 27:17.040]  Insane,
[27:17.160 --> 27:24.400]  is insane. But it really is a frustrating contrast to the fact
[27:24.400 --> 27:26.440]  that the base models only have eight. Yes.
[27:26.480 --> 27:29.800]  Right. No, I agree. Yeah. I mean, honestly, like the more I
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.880]  think about that, I'm bothered by that. But that's just it.
[27:31.880 --> 27:34.520]  That's such a cheap move. Because if anything, I'm
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.640]  thinking it costs them since like, since like, like 10s of
[27:38.640 --> 27:42.360]  cents for difference for them to have the 16 gig diode versus
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.360]  eight, they're integrating the whole thing. I'm like, if
[27:44.360 --> 27:47.520]  anything, I'm like, is this leftover stuff? Like, what? How
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.160]  are you inviting eight gigabyte chips
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.120]  with any of the M three max configs, which I think start I
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.400]  haven't written it starts at 18. Or it starts at 18. It starts at
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.360]  18. And the Mac starts at 36. Alright, so forget not the 36.
[28:03.360 --> 28:06.880]  But once you get to like 48, you could have eight gigs of RAM go
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.440]  bad. And you might not notice. Right. That's true. That's a
[28:10.440 --> 28:14.440]  very good point. It is an incredible amount of RAM for a
[28:14.440 --> 28:18.440]  laptop and Intel the Intel machines never even came close
[28:18.440 --> 28:23.800]  to it was the I think the most 64 was it you could get an Intel
[28:23.800 --> 28:27.800]  MacBook with the last four for the last gen i nine 16 inches.
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.960]  Yes. Well, it was only those and of course, those machines ran
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.520]  hot. And it was not a great chip. And they were they were
[28:35.520 --> 28:39.080]  struggling. But yeah, that final model, you could use 64. I
[28:39.080 --> 28:41.640]  remember because I looked at potentially getting one of
[28:41.640 --> 28:45.680]  those. I'm so glad I didn't. But yeah, I mean, at this point,
[28:45.680 --> 28:48.840]  even PC laptops, even some of the higher end 164 is usually
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.440]  as high as you can go. So having 128 and a laptop that runs the
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.240]  same speed plugged in or or not, that's a flex. And that's a real
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.000]  flex when you're talking about having like this much power in
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.240]  these machines. And when we look at it back that we're basically
[29:03.240 --> 29:06.200]  just three years into this transition, like that's really
[29:06.200 --> 29:06.800]  incredible.
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.800]  Yeah. And on the on the PC side, and I'm no expert on PC hardware,
[29:10.800 --> 29:13.320]  but I follow along enough. I mean, it really is on the
[29:13.320 --> 29:17.800]  laptop side. Almost like two modes, right? There's plugged in
[29:17.800 --> 29:23.200]  mode where you've kind of got what what laptops started as 30
[29:23.200 --> 29:28.200]  years ago, that desktop PCs that somehow you could pick up and
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.320]  take away from the desk without restarting, but definitely run
[29:32.800 --> 29:36.720]  the right way, only when they're plugged in. And when they're not
[29:36.720 --> 29:40.520]  plugged in switch to almost an entirely different mode of
[29:40.560 --> 29:43.640]  performance, you know, brightness, everything kind of
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.440]  drops down. Certainly in terms of graphics performance and
[29:47.440 --> 29:50.480]  stuff like that, not nothing, you know, stays the same as when
[29:50.480 --> 29:53.600]  it's plugged in. And you don't get and even so you don't get
[29:53.600 --> 29:54.920]  good battery life. No,
[29:54.960 --> 29:58.080]  some of the Ryzen machines do better than some of the Intel
[29:58.080 --> 30:02.000]  ones. And but if you're talking about anything that has any sort
[30:02.000 --> 30:05.000]  of GPU associated with it at all, no, the battery life is
[30:05.040 --> 30:11.480]  abysmal. And so in certainly the integrated GPUs are not as good
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.000]  as the Apple GPUs. The Apple GPUs are not as good as the
[30:15.000 --> 30:17.520]  discrete graphics cards. And they're not as good as the
[30:17.600 --> 30:21.360]  laptops that have 30 90s or 40 90s or whatever are in them.
[30:21.400 --> 30:24.520]  They're not. But the the integrated ones from from Intel
[30:24.520 --> 30:29.320]  or AMD or whoever are definitely better on the Mac. And that's a
[30:29.320 --> 30:32.920]  really interesting place to be because I, you know, don't think
[30:32.920 --> 30:35.600]  that a lot of us would have thought that that certainly
[30:35.600 --> 30:37.960]  wasn't the case even four years ago. And I think even three
[30:37.960 --> 30:41.480]  years ago, a lot of us, myself most definitely, we're a little
[30:41.480 --> 30:44.320]  bit cautious, but a little bit suspect, like, okay, is this
[30:44.320 --> 30:46.840]  really going to be able to compete with the best PC
[30:46.840 --> 30:48.440]  laptops, like putting the battery life aside
[30:48.440 --> 30:50.600]  performance wise, will this be able to compete? And I think
[30:50.600 --> 30:52.840]  the answer is, to your point, unless you have one that is
[30:52.840 --> 30:55.160]  literally designed just to be plugged in, and it's essentially
[30:55.200 --> 31:01.560]  a desktop that happens to have a fixed screen. Yeah, there, it's
[31:01.600 --> 31:04.360]  it must be very specific needs, like you want to play games, or
[31:04.360 --> 31:07.520]  you're wanting to do certain AI workloads. I can't think of any
[31:07.520 --> 31:11.600]  reason why anybody would not buy a Mac laptop right now.
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.760]  Yeah, definitely. All right, let's take a break. I'm gonna
[31:13.760 --> 31:17.840]  thank our first sponsor. And it is a brand new sponsor for the
[31:17.840 --> 31:21.120]  show. I'm very happy to have them, especially so because they
[31:21.120 --> 31:25.680]  sent me a bunch of free stuff. And I love it nuts.com. Alright,
[31:25.680 --> 31:30.760]  nuts.com is your one stop shop for freshly roasted nuts, dried
[31:30.760 --> 31:35.480]  fruit, sweets, pantry stables, like specialty flowers and more.
[31:35.800 --> 31:39.840]  So it's kind of misnamed, but kind of a catchy domain. They
[31:39.840 --> 31:42.480]  have a lot more than nuts, but it's nuts.com. Their wide
[31:42.480 --> 31:45.720]  selection means there is something for everyone at
[31:45.720 --> 31:49.760]  nuts.com. Quality is a top priority. They roast their nuts
[31:49.760 --> 31:53.400]  and pop their corn the same day it ships. So they reach you
[31:53.440 --> 31:58.160]  deliciously fresh. Satisfaction is guaranteed. They had a very
[31:58.160 --> 32:02.440]  nice questionnaire for me as the podcast host and what was I
[32:02.440 --> 32:05.200]  interested in. And as soon as I saw this product, I knew I had
[32:05.200 --> 32:08.680]  to have it and it was exactly what I wanted it to be. They
[32:08.680 --> 32:13.560]  call it half popped popcorn. I love popcorn. I also love corn
[32:13.560 --> 32:16.520]  nuts, which is sort of like roasted corn kernels. Half
[32:16.520 --> 32:22.360]  popped popcorn is like, exactly halfway between corn nuts and
[32:22.360 --> 32:28.480]  popcorn. And it is if I always as a kid always loved I don't
[32:28.480 --> 32:32.280]  like eating the unpopped kernels, but I like the half
[32:32.280 --> 32:35.200]  popped ones when you make popcorn, but there's only ever
[32:35.200 --> 32:38.800]  like three of them. When you make popcorn. This is like a
[32:38.800 --> 32:42.560]  whole bag of just half popped popcorn. And I absolutely love
[32:42.560 --> 32:46.600]  it. If this appeals to you, if you and I'm telling you, buy the
[32:46.600 --> 32:50.440]  half popped popcorn and pick some other stuff. But I'm
[32:50.440 --> 32:53.240]  telling you, it was exactly what I wanted. I love it. I've
[32:53.240 --> 32:56.280]  already eaten almost all of it that they sent me. They've got
[32:56.280 --> 32:59.280]  all sorts of other stuff. I got stuff I got like these little
[32:59.960 --> 33:02.360]  sort of stuff. I don't know, I guess you could send it if you
[33:02.360 --> 33:05.680]  have kids who pack a lunch. It's like little individual bags, but
[33:05.680 --> 33:09.360]  I love them. They're like little single serving bags of trail
[33:09.360 --> 33:12.360]  mix. They've got these things they call peanut butter and
[33:12.360 --> 33:15.560]  jelly, but it's really like a peanut butter and raisin mix.
[33:17.080 --> 33:20.480]  Stuff like that. They've got these honey roasted sesame
[33:20.560 --> 33:25.040]  sticks, which I also am sort of addicted to already really,
[33:25.040 --> 33:27.840]  really good. The snacky stuff is right up my alley. It's stuff
[33:27.880 --> 33:30.600]  that I just sit there and eat all night while I'm watching TV
[33:30.600 --> 33:33.840]  on the couch. But they've got all sorts of other stuff and
[33:33.840 --> 33:36.760]  this sort at a company called nuts.com. They've got all the
[33:36.760 --> 33:40.000]  standard stuff that you would think that they would have like
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.800]  cashews and almonds. And do you want it salted? Do you want it
[33:44.800 --> 33:47.600]  unsalted? Do you just want it raw? I don't know. I don't know
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.280]  what kind of animal eats raw almonds, but some people do. I
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.320]  like them salty and roasted, but they got them all. Peanut pecan
[33:55.320 --> 33:59.200]  brittle, butter toffee, pecans, all of this stuff. I mean, just
[33:59.200 --> 34:02.920]  like literally hundreds of products. They got so much stuff.
[34:02.960 --> 34:05.880]  It's really good pistachios. I got some of those really, really
[34:05.880 --> 34:09.640]  good, all sorts of good stuff. And so again, if you've got kids
[34:09.640 --> 34:11.760]  and you're packing lunch, they've got all sorts of stuff
[34:11.760 --> 34:14.680]  in little bags that you can just throw in lunch or just, you
[34:14.680 --> 34:18.120]  know, stick in their backpack when they go to school. Big bags
[34:18.120 --> 34:21.040]  of the stuff. It's really, really great. I love this stuff.
[34:21.040 --> 34:24.560]  I'm very, very happy about the stuff they sent me. They've also
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.480]  got gluten free options, organic choices, diet friendly products,
[34:29.480 --> 34:32.320]  whatever you're looking for. Really, it's a ton, a ton of
[34:32.320 --> 34:35.640]  products. And it's really, really good. delivered, of
[34:35.640 --> 34:39.320]  course, straight to your home, you can buy as much as you want.
[34:39.320 --> 34:42.320]  It's really, really good. They have a special deal for
[34:42.320 --> 34:45.120]  listeners of the show right now nuts.com is offering new
[34:45.120 --> 34:48.720]  customers a free gift with purchase and free shipping on

[35:19.000 --> 35:22.520]  show. Alright, before I forget, Christina, I got another
[35:22.520 --> 35:24.640]  complaint. I want to knock off the complaints first, because
[35:24.640 --> 35:27.760]  it's overall very good news day. But I got it. I have another
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.160]  complaint. And I think it might be the single most surprising
[35:32.160 --> 35:35.920]  news of the day. And I mean this sincerely it is. It's a small
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.840]  thing. It's not big. It's not a deal stopper. But I think it is
[35:39.840 --> 35:44.400]  the thing that is the most what the hell. And that is the fact
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.760]  that the keyboard, mouse and trackpad with the iMac are still
[35:49.800 --> 35:50.800]  they're still lightning.
[35:50.880 --> 35:54.600]  Yes, but what the actual like, tell me you don't care about the
[35:54.600 --> 35:57.400]  24 inch iMac without telling me you don't care about the 24 inch
[35:57.400 --> 35:57.920]  iMac.
[35:57.960 --> 36:00.920]  What? I don't get it. And this has nothing to do with any kind
[36:00.920 --> 36:04.520]  of compliance with EU regulations. I think I've been
[36:04.520 --> 36:07.440]  writing about the fact that that those regulations don't kick in
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.920]  until the end of next year. So Apple did not have to move the
[36:10.920 --> 36:14.640]  iPhone to USB C this year, they could have waited till next
[36:14.640 --> 36:17.840]  year, I think next year, they kind of did have a mandate that
[36:17.840 --> 36:21.320]  they kind of had to do it next year. They didn't have to but I
[36:21.320 --> 36:24.600]  just think it's sort of okay. Well, there's that and the fact
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.000]  that it just is nice having everything USB C and then you
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.240]  can just have like with my studio display, I can have one
[36:31.240 --> 36:35.720]  USB C cable coming out. That's just there to charge products.
[36:35.760 --> 36:38.800]  Yeah, like, oh, that's how I have it now. Yeah, it was very
[36:38.800 --> 36:42.440]  nice. I one of the cables connects to the Mac, and I've
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.240]  got one for my keyboard and but then just one dedicated cable
[36:46.240 --> 36:49.640]  that just sits there and I can put my AirPods case in now with
[36:49.640 --> 36:54.720]  the new AirPods Pro because they upgraded that to USB C. What the
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.080]  actual No, I agree. It's ridiculous. And it's funny you
[36:58.080 --> 37:00.280]  say that because I'm like literally grabbing from my studio
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.200]  display, my lightning cable to plug in my magic trackpad,
[37:04.200 --> 37:06.480]  because I just realized that like the battery on that was
[37:06.480 --> 37:08.680]  getting low. But I do I have like two things coming from
[37:08.680 --> 37:11.920]  that, like one, you know, for USB C, and one with with
[37:11.920 --> 37:15.880]  lightning coming off of it. Yeah, this this makes no sense.
[37:15.880 --> 37:20.880]  Like it would be such an easy to me kind of like retooling thing
[37:20.880 --> 37:23.520]  to do. It would also make sense because they can still sell
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.160]  those accessories separately. And it would be a good thing for
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.080]  anybody who's buying them to use with a Mac Studio or a Mac Mini
[37:31.080 --> 37:35.400]  or even a MacBook Pro because, hey, I can just use a straight
[37:35.400 --> 37:39.360]  USB cable. I don't have to worry about having the USB C to
[37:39.360 --> 37:42.560]  lightning cable in a bag, right? Because that's increasingly
[37:42.560 --> 37:45.640]  going to become less common. Like I'm annoyed that they
[37:45.640 --> 37:50.840]  haven't updated the AirPods Max, because that's like my last real
[37:50.840 --> 37:56.040]  piece of like day to day gear that uses lightning, I found an
[37:56.040 --> 38:02.040]  excuse to buy the new AirPod pros second gens with USB C, my
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.280]  rationalization there because I'd lost a pair like six weeks
[38:05.280 --> 38:07.880]  before. And so it had buy another pair. And I was like,
[38:07.880 --> 38:10.800]  man, this is unfortunate. I literally just bought another
[38:10.800 --> 38:13.520]  pair. And then I realized I was in Washington, DC with a friend
[38:13.520 --> 38:15.960]  of mine. And I realized, oh, Aaron doesn't have a pair of
[38:15.960 --> 38:19.160]  AirPods. So Aaron needs a pair of AirPods. So I'm going to give
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.960]  these to her. And then that's my excuse to to buy the ones with
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.000]  USB C. But like, it's annoying to me that they Yeah, just make
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.040]  the move because it's not like they can't use those accessories
[38:30.040 --> 38:31.280]  and future products.
[38:31.840 --> 38:35.160]  Eventually, you they have to change eventually. Yeah. So why
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.680]  not now? It just seems very strange. And with the iPhone
[38:38.680 --> 38:44.400]  moving from lightning to USB C is the flagship. Yeah, lightning
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.520]  to USB C transition, right? Lightning that's literally
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.200]  invented for the iPhone. Absolutely. So that's the big
[38:51.200 --> 38:57.640]  one. And then doing it alongside the AirPods Pro two with USB C,
[38:57.640 --> 39:00.920]  right? You have to because there's also us the AirPods Pro
[39:00.920 --> 39:04.640]  two with lightning, but right. It's like, like I said, it's
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.200]  like version 2.5 or 2.1. Exactly, exactly. Because they
[39:08.200 --> 39:13.080]  also those those AirPods Pro also uniquely have the upcoming
[39:13.080 --> 39:18.520]  ability to do lossless audio quality with the with the
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.680]  vision with the vision Pro. Yeah. Which again, it's annoying
[39:22.680 --> 39:25.600]  if you've got the lightning ones. But again, I I'm telling
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.160]  you, I really do not believe I think there's like one 10th of
[39:29.160 --> 39:32.720]  1% of human beings who could hear the difference between high
[39:32.720 --> 39:39.320]  quality. Oh, yeah. In compressed audio, and lossless audio. So
[39:39.360 --> 39:42.680]  it's not, but it is mildly annoying, right? In the same way
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.640]  that I just have to have space black for my laptop. It's like I
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.160]  can kind of I get it, you kind of want if you if you spent 250
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.160]  bucks on your wireless AirPods Pro, you kind of want the best
[39:54.160 --> 39:56.720]  ones. And it's like, yeah, it's kind of annoying. But they move
[39:56.720 --> 40:01.840]  those. I can't believe that this is not the debut of the magic
[40:01.840 --> 40:06.200]  keyboard magic trackpad magic mouse with with light or with
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.360]  USB C. I'm just jaw dropped. And it was so totally it was so
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.880]  funny. Me getting this morning briefing today and getting the
[40:15.880 --> 40:21.160]  news under NDA eight hours ahead of the video coming out. And
[40:21.160 --> 40:24.360]  then like being on the train coming back to Philly from New
[40:24.360 --> 40:28.680]  York and like browsing Mastodon and seeing people's predictions
[40:28.680 --> 40:32.360]  and everybody's prediction included new peripherals with
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.320]  USB C,
[40:33.400 --> 40:35.200]  because it just makes sense. Like you're thinking, okay,
[40:35.200 --> 40:38.000]  that's what they're going to do. And and it's annoying because
[40:38.600 --> 40:42.520]  presumably there will hopefully, hopefully one day be a larger
[40:42.520 --> 40:45.240]  screened iMac that will actually have a powerful
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.840]  processor in it and a decent amount of RAM. And that will of
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.960]  course have USB C accessories. So it's just I don't know, to
[40:53.960 --> 40:56.040]  me, just like I said, it makes me feel like they just really
[40:56.040 --> 40:59.600]  do not care about the 24 inch iMac at all like spec bump.
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.040]  This is not a big seller. I don't think they push a lot of
[41:03.040 --> 41:06.560]  units. This is just one of those things they have to say we still
[41:06.560 --> 41:07.440]  sell an iMac.
[41:07.680 --> 41:11.720]  And it is the only Mac that skipped the M two generation.
[41:11.720 --> 41:16.200]  Right? Even the even the Mac Mini, which I say even not to
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.000]  disparage it, but right. They ignored that for forever, right?
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.080]  For a while it was ignored, right? And then it was they kind
[41:24.080 --> 41:27.720]  of came back and it was one of those. It wasn't quite as big as
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.600]  the Mac Pro mea culpa. But they kind of did like a Hey, we took
[41:32.600 --> 41:34.840]  you know, as close as Apple is ever going to come to saying we
[41:34.840 --> 41:37.560]  kind of took our eye off the Mac Mini for a while. But we found
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.600]  out that lots of pros use this for really pro scenarios. I
[41:42.600 --> 41:44.840]  remember hearing about like, people who do the audio for
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.880]  concerts, who love the Mac Mini, because it's small. And because
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.520]  they, you know, they need to tear down the whole thing every
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.000]  night, because it's a concert tour, and they're going
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.520]  different places. And so, you know, smaller is better, but
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.240]  they don't want a laptop, they want something that they're
[42:03.240 --> 42:06.920]  going to plug in, it's, you know, pro audio gear. They say
[42:06.920 --> 42:10.200]  you know, the iMac is you know, they and I believe it, what else
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.400]  would be the best selling all in one right in the world. But it's
[42:15.400 --> 42:17.480]  so it's like, on the one hand, they're bragging, it's the best
[42:17.480 --> 42:20.360]  selling all in one, they're still selling it. The iMac is
[42:20.360 --> 42:22.760]  obviously near and dear to Apple's heart, because, you
[42:22.760 --> 42:25.880]  know, we just sell them. Yeah, we just celebrated the 25th
[42:25.880 --> 42:30.520]  anniversary of the original iMac. It harks back to the
[42:30.520 --> 42:35.640]  original Mac from 1984, which was an all in one. So they some
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.920]  it's obviously worth still making, but it was also not
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.640]  worth having an M2 generation. These they are they're the
[42:45.640 --> 42:48.680]  identical colors. Nobody's everybody's happy because it is
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.160]  the most colorful product left in Apple's entire lineup of all
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.280]  products. So thank God they didn't bleed the color out of
[42:56.280 --> 42:59.640]  them. Yeah, that's true. We'd be very upset if that happened.
[42:59.640 --> 43:02.040]  And I'm glad that they did go ahead and get this more juice
[43:02.040 --> 43:05.560]  than that. These are M3s. Although I will say it is kind
[43:05.560 --> 43:08.120]  of a little bit annoying that it is just the base level M3
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.280]  that they don't have an option even for it for I'm not I
[43:10.280 --> 43:14.600]  wouldn't expect a max but yeah, the pro would be nice. Like
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.520]  again, the Mac Mini, which is at this point a great machine.
[43:18.520 --> 43:21.240]  And I think that a lot of people you can get an M2 Pro or
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.160]  regular M2. Look, I still think that for a lot of people like
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.040]  you would it's similar to the MacBook Air, like depending on
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.960]  what you need, you probably be better off getting a well
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.200]  specced M2 Pro Mac Mini than getting a Mac Studio. If that's
[43:34.200 --> 43:37.560]  what you're after in terms of that form factor, right. And
[43:37.560 --> 43:40.120]  you're absolutely better off getting the Mac Studio Ultra
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.040]  than getting a Mac Pro. Like that's not even a conversation.
[43:44.040 --> 43:47.720]  So yeah, it's frustrating. I know they care about the iMac.
[43:48.520 --> 43:51.800]  But I'm really, really hoping because I love the iMac, I will
[43:51.800 --> 43:54.200]  always have a special place in my heart for the iMac. I really
[43:54.200 --> 43:59.320]  want like the 32 inch 6k iMac at some point that is like a
[43:59.320 --> 44:03.800]  proper, powerful machine. Like maybe it doesn't have a huge
[44:03.800 --> 44:05.400]  market, but I would definitely buy one.
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.480]  I do think and this is something that just came in while
[44:09.480 --> 44:12.760]  we're recording a friend texted me who's trying to configure
[44:12.760 --> 44:15.160]  this for somebody now to see this is not true. Somebody
[44:15.160 --> 44:18.520]  texted me. This is not true. I would have been shocking. So
[44:18.520 --> 44:20.920]  I'm glad I double checked and didn't just take their word.
[44:20.920 --> 44:25.160]  You can customize the iMac. The base models are eight, but
[44:25.160 --> 44:27.080]  you can get 16 or 24.
[44:27.080 --> 44:30.120]  Yes, yes. Yeah, you go all the way up to 24 gigs. Yeah. But the
[44:30.120 --> 44:33.240]  only thing is, is that it's not a pro or a max, because that's
[44:33.240 --> 44:37.400]  still the maximum amount of RAM, like for that M3 is basically
[44:37.400 --> 44:39.960]  the same as like what it was for the base level like M1 and
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.120]  M2. So yes, you can go up to 24 gigs of RAM, which is nice.
[44:44.120 --> 44:47.640]  And you can go up to a I'm looking at it now, a two terabyte
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.160]  SSD. And if you do those both of those things, then you're
[44:51.160 --> 44:57.400]  looking at a $2,700 computer, which, at that point, I don't
[44:57.400 --> 45:00.600]  know, I think you're better off maybe again, looking at this,
[45:00.600 --> 45:04.680]  which I think is what they want getting a studio display and a
[45:04.680 --> 45:07.080]  Mac Mini. But yeah, I don't know.
[45:07.080 --> 45:11.560]  Well, and the one thing they reiterated in person, and then
[45:11.560 --> 45:14.920]  in the broadcast, the half hour broadcast tonight, I think they
[45:14.920 --> 45:19.240]  mentioned it, they only gave the iMac a couple minutes, I think
[45:19.240 --> 45:23.160]  like three minutes. Yeah. Yeah. In those three minutes, I think
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.960]  they mentioned at least three times that 24 inches is the
[45:27.960 --> 45:34.520]  perfect size, both for people coming from a 21 inch Intel iMac,
[45:34.520 --> 45:39.000]  which is true. Yes, because this is definitely bigger and
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.720]  better. But also for people coming from a 27 inch iMac. And
[45:43.720 --> 45:48.440]  that, that, that no, that makes no sense. That's a lie. That's a
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.960]  lie. I'm talking to you from a 27 inch iMac right now where I
[45:51.960 --> 45:56.520]  have a 27 inch studio display right next to it. No, if you
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.200]  told me Oh, yeah, you can lose 20% of your screen real estate,
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.000]  right? And a chunk of your resolution? No, everybody knows
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.880]  everybody who's ever bought a computer knows that. Okay, once
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.240]  you're talking about diagonals, yeah, three inches is a big
[46:11.240 --> 46:14.840]  difference. It is. Yeah, like I said, I said 20% it might be
[46:14.840 --> 46:17.480]  more than that. But it's the fact that it's four and a half
[46:17.480 --> 46:19.960]  k and not five k. That says it all right there.
[46:21.080 --> 46:27.080]  If you're if your current iMac, Intel iMac is so old that it's a
[46:27.080 --> 46:33.240]  27 inch not retina iMac. Okay, okay. Yes, this display is an
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.440]  upgrade even though it's smaller, right? If you had a 27
[46:36.440 --> 46:40.520]  inch retina iMac, 24 inch, I don't care about the brightness
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.400]  or no, that's a downgrade. It's a downgrade. Stop telling me
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.560]  that this is a better deal. But I do feel that putting on my
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.520]  translator hat from Cupertino ease to English is the point of
[46:54.520 --> 46:58.760]  their repeated insistence that this is a great display no
[46:58.760 --> 47:02.760]  matter which old iMac you're upgrading from. The translation
[47:02.760 --> 47:07.560]  is we are not going to make a big iMac. Yeah. So that's the
[47:07.560 --> 47:10.840]  translation. That's probably true. That's that's how I
[47:10.840 --> 47:14.920]  interpret it. I interpret it as meaning if you want an all in
[47:14.920 --> 47:18.760]  one iMac, I hope you like 24 inches because that's all we're
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.920]  going to make. And if you want a bigger display, we'll be happy
[47:22.920 --> 47:26.680]  to sell you a Mac Mini or Mac Studio if you need the
[47:26.680 --> 47:31.320]  performance and a studio display. And my personal opinion
[47:31.320 --> 47:35.720]  as a nerd who loves to offer my opinion solicited or
[47:35.720 --> 47:40.680]  unsolicited is a better way to spend your money because these
[47:40.680 --> 47:46.040]  displays last a long time. There's not we've already done
[47:46.680 --> 47:49.320]  the move from non retina to retina. They're not going to
[47:49.320 --> 47:53.320]  move to 3x retina or 4x retina. There's no point to it. Right.
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.480]  And the brightness is what it is. So getting a studio display
[47:57.480 --> 48:00.040]  now, even though the studio display has been out for a
[48:00.040 --> 48:02.360]  while, it's still in my opinion is a good buy. I know it's
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.240]  expensive. You can or if you want to buy a third party. I
[48:05.240 --> 48:08.680]  know there's more 5k options out there that are ready. I'm a
[48:08.680 --> 48:12.200]  big fan of the studio display. I love mine. I love the nano
[48:12.200 --> 48:16.040]  texture thing, which is expensive, but it solves all of
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.680]  these incredibly harsh sunlight glare angles I have or lighting
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.400]  issues I have in my home office. And I don't care about the I
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.480]  mean, I do care about the camera. I wish the camera were
[48:27.480 --> 48:30.680]  better. Yes. For the price. That's my only real net. So I
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.960]  bought the VESA model, which is typically what I buy for these
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.320]  things. And then I have an expensive monitor arm because I
[48:37.320 --> 48:39.320]  prefer that because that way I can actually rotate it and I
[48:39.320 --> 48:43.080]  don't have to deal with that BS. That is annoying to me that
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.800]  for the price they charge, that you have to make your decision
[48:45.800 --> 48:48.680]  when you buy it if you actually want to be able to rotate it or
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.480]  not. And I had the LG 5k display before and what's it called
[48:53.480 --> 48:55.880]  the very fine? Yeah, the very fine. Yeah, the super fine,
[48:55.880 --> 49:00.520]  whatever it is. Yeah. The ultra fine. That's the ultra
[49:00.520 --> 49:03.800]  fine. And that was fine. The the slightly disappointment thing.
[49:03.800 --> 49:06.600]  I think for me, I was like, I'd wanted it to be and if the
[49:06.600 --> 49:08.520]  camera been better, I've been like, Oh, okay, well, then this
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.560]  is worth a 50% premium on on what it used to cost, and or 40%
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.120]  or whatever it was. And the camera is garbage. And I don't
[49:16.120 --> 49:18.440]  like that I doesn't have a power button. I use the trick
[49:18.440 --> 49:21.880]  that that you use where I got the smart plug so that I can
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.880]  actually power cycle it. But I have come around in my like,
[49:25.880 --> 49:28.360]  year and a half or however long it's been close to two years
[49:28.360 --> 49:31.080]  now since I've bought the thing, because I got it like,
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.680]  literally, I pre ordered it the day that it was announced. I
[49:34.680 --> 49:37.400]  have come around and I've gone Okay, I think it's expensive.
[49:38.120 --> 49:41.880]  But if you are someone like you and I who will not be happy with
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.400]  anything other than 2x, right? Like and I can't I can't use a
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.720]  4k on a Mac. I just can't. Unless it's a 24 inch size, in
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.000]  which case then it actually would be 2x. But I can't use a
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.240]  27 inch or 32 inch 4k monitor on a Mac. I just can't I need
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.320]  that pixel doubling. And that's the case. I mean, your, your
[50:01.320 --> 50:05.000]  option is basically the studio display. Yeah. So I do think
[50:05.000 --> 50:10.040]  that's a better buy. I think if you were waiting for 27 inch or
[50:10.040 --> 50:15.320]  bigger consumer prosumer level way of doing Apple silicon on
[50:15.320 --> 50:19.240]  your desktop, if you had bought the studio display as soon as it
[50:19.240 --> 50:23.960]  came out, and just bought whatever the then current I don't
[50:23.960 --> 50:26.920]  know if they were still in the M one or if the M two Mac minis
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.920]  were I think the M twos had just come out, you that display will
[50:30.920 --> 50:34.520]  be fine. Yeah. And then you could I know M three Mac minis
[50:34.520 --> 50:37.320]  aren't out yet. But you could upgrade you could upgrade year
[50:37.320 --> 50:40.840]  when no happens. You could wait for the M four in a year and a
[50:40.840 --> 50:42.920]  half or two years whenever that's gonna happen. Oh, yeah,
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.240]  no, because this thing's gonna last a decade at least right?
[50:45.240 --> 50:49.240]  Like already, it's it's seven years old, the technology anyway.
[50:49.240 --> 50:52.920]  And that was the one thing we lost when we went from the
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.120]  regular to the retina IMAX was that the way that they could do
[50:56.120 --> 50:59.320]  the doubling, they had to get rid of target display mode. And
[50:59.320 --> 51:01.720]  that had been great with the previous IMAX because you could
[51:01.720 --> 51:05.400]  use them like, as a as a standalone display. You can't
[51:05.400 --> 51:08.520]  do that anymore. And so I think that is a great point from just
[51:08.520 --> 51:11.640]  a value perspective. Having them separate. I think you're
[51:11.640 --> 51:16.200]  right. That's a better deal. I still love having like a proper
[51:16.200 --> 51:18.920]  all in one. But you're not wrong. Like if I were to do it
[51:18.920 --> 51:21.880]  tomorrow, like if I were actually going to replace the
[51:21.880 --> 51:25.560]  the completely maxed out Intel IMAX that I have that I bought
[51:25.560 --> 51:27.960]  in 2020, even though I knew when I bought it, like they'd
[51:27.960 --> 51:30.520]  already announced Apple silicon, but I bought it for a reason I
[51:30.520 --> 51:33.240]  knew that it was going to be a while for some of the stuff that
[51:33.240 --> 51:38.200]  I do to be in one ready. And I was like, just go all out, spend
[51:38.840 --> 51:42.040]  all the money on it and upgrade the hell out of the thing. And
[51:42.040 --> 51:45.320]  it's three years later, it's still a very capable machine.
[51:45.320 --> 51:48.200]  But if I were to do that, again, I would absolutely have either
[51:48.200 --> 51:52.600]  like a Mac Studio or Mac Mini Pro paired with the studio
[51:52.600 --> 51:55.400]  display. Like that's what I would be doing. I do think that
[51:55.400 --> 51:59.320]  is better for more people. But I totally I do get it. You're
[51:59.320 --> 52:01.720]  right, though. There's some people that and whether it's
[52:01.720 --> 52:05.880]  logical or just affection, people want an all in one. And
[52:05.880 --> 52:10.680]  if I ruled Apple, I would make a bigger iMac too. Yeah, I like
[52:10.680 --> 52:13.560]  this size. I love that they're colorful. I think they look
[52:13.560 --> 52:15.800]  great. I think they look fantastic. Like I've almost
[52:15.800 --> 52:19.160]  bought one a few times that I have no need for and that I
[52:19.160 --> 52:21.240]  can't even justify it that way. They would just be like, Oh, it's
[52:21.240 --> 52:24.120]  a secondary machine. I'm like, you have so many computers. And
[52:24.120 --> 52:27.240]  that's where I will like I can convince myself to buy a black
[52:27.240 --> 52:30.840]  laptop, but I can't convince myself to have like a superfluous
[52:30.840 --> 52:33.160]  pink iMac as much as I would love it.
[52:33.160 --> 52:34.600]  But I wish they made a bigger one.
[52:34.600 --> 52:36.360]  Me too. Me too. That'd be lovely.
[52:36.920 --> 52:39.240]  I don't have much more to say about the iMac, though. We can
[52:39.240 --> 52:40.280]  go back to the Mac Pro.
[52:40.280 --> 52:41.640]  Yeah, let's go back to the Mac Pro. Yeah,
[52:41.640 --> 52:44.120]  I don't have much. I will say this. I was in the Apple store
[52:44.120 --> 52:47.160]  last week. I needed to buy. I'll explain. Yeah, everybody
[52:47.160 --> 52:51.640]  knows I have a very old car. My car is 2006 accurate. I need to
[52:51.640 --> 52:54.840]  buy a new car, but I don't drive that much. And so my car is
[52:54.840 --> 52:59.320]  so old that when we bought it, the option, the upgrade option
[52:59.320 --> 53:03.800]  was to get a built in 30 pin adapter. Yes. And I had the
[53:03.800 --> 53:07.080]  wisdom. And I thought, ah, that's not here for long. So I
[53:07.080 --> 53:12.200]  didn't get it. But so we our card has no way of no Bluetooth.
[53:12.200 --> 53:14.760]  There's no way there's no car player or anything like that.
[53:14.760 --> 53:18.360]  And because I really should have years ago replaced it and
[53:18.360 --> 53:21.320]  least something new. So I'm not going to spend the money to
[53:21.320 --> 53:25.960]  put like a carplay system in. So anyway, I've got a one of
[53:25.960 --> 53:29.480]  those tape players. It's a cassette tape. Yeah, for the
[53:29.480 --> 53:33.000]  Bluetooth, right? Yeah. Well, no, no, I could buy Bluetooth,
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.400]  but instead I have the headphone jack one. Oh, okay,
[53:35.400 --> 53:38.120]  cool. So I know they make them I probably I should look into
[53:38.120 --> 53:41.800]  the Bluetooth, but I have a cassette tape that you put in
[53:41.800 --> 53:44.440]  the tape deck and then there's a wire that comes out of it and
[53:44.440 --> 53:48.360]  you plug it in. But I realized only when I had to drive
[53:48.360 --> 53:51.960]  somewhere like a week and a half ago. Oh shit, I have a new
[53:51.960 --> 53:54.680]  iPhone and I can't plug in lightning, right? It was like
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.720]  one of the few times I was like, I thought I got rid of all the
[53:57.720 --> 54:00.520]  lightning I needed to and I didn't. So I needed to buy
[54:00.520 --> 54:06.200]  Apple's $9 headphone jack to USB C adapter, right? I live near
[54:06.200 --> 54:08.600]  the Apple Store here in Philadelphia. And so I just when
[54:08.600 --> 54:13.240]  I was walking by, went in to get it and I went in to buy this
[54:13.240 --> 54:17.000]  $9 little thing and the self checkout was nice. I didn't have
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.320]  to talk to anybody. But it literally caught my eye and I
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.080]  just thought, man, those iMacs look cool. Yeah, you know, they
[54:25.080 --> 54:28.440]  look like it's like the only color in the whole store. I
[54:28.440 --> 54:31.560]  know. I know. I hope and look, although to go back to MacBook
[54:31.560 --> 54:35.800]  Pro, like we got black, which I realized is not as bright as I
[54:35.800 --> 54:38.680]  would like. But this is a real black. This isn't the weird,
[54:38.680 --> 54:41.400]  very shades of black that we got on the phone this year.
[54:41.400 --> 54:45.160]  It's good in person. It's not black. It's not black. It really
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.320]  is space. Very, very dark gray guy. I almost feel like maybe
[54:49.320 --> 54:52.520]  black wouldn't be right. I actually think maybe this is as
[54:52.520 --> 54:55.960]  dark as it should go. Yeah, I mean, for aluminum, that's
[54:55.960 --> 54:59.320]  probably they're probably getting as dark as they can get.
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.160]  Because with plastic, you can obviously go completely black,
[55:03.160 --> 55:06.120]  but aluminum, you can't. So I mean, I can't wait to see it in
[55:06.120 --> 55:11.000]  person. Well, but what about the iPhone seven? Right? That was
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.120]  the year where they had Yeah, but the Oh, that was beautiful.
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.400]  They had to they had to black iPhone sevens. They had the matte
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.720]  black, and then the shiny one, the shiny jet jet black jet
[55:21.720 --> 55:25.080]  black. That thing was great. But that thing speak talk about
[55:25.080 --> 55:27.720]  things that like developed kind of a patina and that didn't
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.200]  hold up super well. Like I think there's a reason why that
[55:30.200 --> 55:33.560]  was only one year that they had that. Yeah, because you could
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.080]  scratch it by looking at it. Yes. And I did. It was funny
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.560]  because I got one of those. That was the last year that I was
[55:39.560 --> 55:42.040]  part of the review program because after that I switched
[55:42.040 --> 55:45.800]  careers. And one of my colleagues broke it. And I was
[55:45.800 --> 55:48.680]  so annoyed. And so we had to pay to get it repaired and whatnot.
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.920]  Because I was like, this is checked out under me. I was
[55:50.920 --> 55:53.880]  like, Yeah, it was like you, you, I don't care how it gets
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.160]  paid for, you have to get this thing repaired. But even before
[55:57.160 --> 55:59.480]  that, yeah, it was one of those things like I just had it on my
[55:59.480 --> 56:02.200]  desk. Like literally, I just come back from my briefing with
[56:02.200 --> 56:05.080]  Apple I had on my desk, I think for half an hour, and it got
[56:05.080 --> 56:07.800]  like the first like scratch on it. I was like, I didn't even
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.120]  touch this. But it was beautiful. All right. This is
[56:12.840 --> 56:16.280]  this is kind of weird. Here's a technical detail. And again,
[56:16.280 --> 56:20.440]  reading a chart on a podcast, I realized this is difficult. But
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.040]  all right, the regular M three, not pro, but the regular M three,
[56:26.040 --> 56:31.720]  this has eight CPU cores for performance for efficiency four
[56:31.720 --> 56:38.200]  and four. Okay. The M three pro has 12, six and six, six high
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.040]  performance cores, six efficiency. Okay, that sounds
[56:42.040 --> 56:44.600]  like an upgrade over regular, right? You go from four and four
[56:44.600 --> 56:52.760]  to six and six. The M three max has 16 cores, but it's 12 high
[56:52.760 --> 56:59.000]  performance and only for efficiency. So you actually lose
[56:59.000 --> 57:03.800]  two of the efficiency cores. I find that to be a very strange
[57:04.920 --> 57:11.000]  configuration matrix. I guess the idea is if you're in the
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.840]  market for max, you really are hunting high performance, not
[57:16.840 --> 57:21.000]  long battery life, not efficiency. And so that's the
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.280]  reason you're spending all this money. But again, maybe I'm
[57:24.280 --> 57:29.800]  biased by my desire to get the max just for the RAM. Yeah. And
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.560]  I'd kind of rather if I were only going to have only going to
[57:33.560 --> 57:38.920]  have 16 CPU cores, I'd rather have 10 performance and still
[57:38.920 --> 57:43.480]  have six efficiency. I think. I don't know. It seems weird that
[57:43.480 --> 57:47.160]  you lose two efficiency cores. I don't know. I don't get it.
[57:47.160 --> 57:50.440]  Yeah, that is interesting. Yeah. I'm curious to go back to
[57:50.440 --> 57:54.920]  what it was like with the M two max and max to see if the
[57:54.920 --> 57:58.840]  breakdown was that different. And I don't think it was, but
[57:58.840 --> 58:00.760]  yeah, to your point, I mean, this, this is one thing that
[58:00.760 --> 58:04.440]  I've noticed kind of anecdotally having both the pro and the max
[58:04.440 --> 58:07.480]  machines granted one is a 16 inch from one is a 14. So
[58:07.480 --> 58:09.880]  battery life is going to be better on the 16 regardless,
[58:09.880 --> 58:13.960]  but I have noticed like even taking out that sort of thing. I
[58:13.960 --> 58:16.680]  did have to say like my anecdotal opinion over the last
[58:16.680 --> 58:20.760]  two years or so has been that the pro did have better battery
[58:20.760 --> 58:24.440]  life. If you don't need all that RAM, and if you really think
[58:24.440 --> 58:27.240]  that the max is, I think, yeah, I think they're optimizing for
[58:27.240 --> 58:30.760]  the power there. Not to say that the battery life is bad on the
[58:30.760 --> 58:33.480]  max at all, because it's not. But the battery life on the pro
[58:33.480 --> 58:35.480]  is better, at least from my experience.
[58:36.040 --> 58:39.400]  Yeah, I think it's I think it's going to be and and I kind of
[58:39.400 --> 58:42.360]  asked about that. And it's like, again, you don't get a square
[58:42.360 --> 58:45.880]  answer from Apple. But you know, the up to 22 hours of battery
[58:45.880 --> 58:49.160]  life is with the lower end configs, they're actually more
[58:49.960 --> 58:53.320]  power efficient, or maybe the M3. I don't know, they don't
[58:53.320 --> 58:57.000]  want to answer. I think because the more money you spend, you
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.760]  actually lose some battery life because you're lighting up more
[59:00.760 --> 59:06.600]  RAM and more CPU cores, like the sweet spot for battery life is
[59:06.600 --> 59:10.040]  somewhere in the middle. But I just I just find these numbers
[59:10.040 --> 59:13.480]  unusual. And the other thing that's unusual. So the base
[59:13.480 --> 59:19.160]  model, the regular M3 chip has three options for RAM. And again,
[59:19.160 --> 59:23.800]  like I just reiterated, this is true for the iMac, too. You can
[59:23.800 --> 59:28.600]  go 816 or 24. Well, those to me are very normal computer
[59:28.600 --> 59:34.120]  numbers, 816 and 24. 816 32 would be a little more normal
[59:34.120 --> 59:36.360]  because it's always sort of like a doubling, but I get it, you
[59:36.360 --> 59:41.240]  just keep adding eight. But with the M3 Pro, the two RAM options
[59:41.240 --> 59:45.960]  are 18 gigabytes and 36 gigabytes. Yeah, that's weird.
[59:45.960 --> 59:49.480]  Those are weird computer numbers, right? 18 is not a I
[59:49.480 --> 59:51.800]  don't know how else to say it because it's not a power of two.
[59:51.800 --> 59:55.240]  It's it's not a computer number. I mean, it's better, right? I'd
[59:55.240 --> 59:59.960]  rather have 18 than 16. I agree. And then to make things weirder
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.880]  to it, then at the first level of M3 Max, if you do the 14 core
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:09.640]  30 30 GPU, so the 14 core CPU 30 core GPU, that one is 36 and 96
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:14.280]  are your two options. So okay, you're tripling or whatever, but
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.240]  like you're tripling, but you're back to computer numbers.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.200]  Exactly you are, but although it is now doubled like the 18 or
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.720]  whatever, but it's 36 and 96. And then once you go up to that
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:31.640]  16 core, that's when you can go 48, 64 or 128. That is the
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.440]  interesting thing there, too, is that if you want to get the 96
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.880]  gigabytes of unified memory, you have to get the lower level M3
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.520]  Max. So your options really, if you're going to get the high end
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.520]  M3 Max, for all intents and purposes, you can get a 48
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.160]  gigabytes, but no one's going to do that. It's going to be 64
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.880]  128.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.360]  Right. It's, I don't get it. I'm sure that I'm sure it all makes
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.680]  sense. But it's exactly it. Somehow I would need to get
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.040]  Johnny Suruji on the podcast, or maybe Ternus would explain it,
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.360]  but I don't think that they would explain it. They're just
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.960]  like, ah, the 18 is better than 16. It has to be something I'm
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.360]  assuming with how their cores are working and whatever their
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.920]  maximum, like, since it's their unified memory or whatever. And
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.320]  that's the only thing I can gather is that they want to be
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.440]  able to dedicate a certain amount of RAM to the GPU, but I
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.080]  don't know. That's just me completely guessing.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:29.080]  Yeah, it does seem overall like they're putting more of a gap
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.880]  between the M3 Pro and the M3 Max, right? It's like, and that's
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.200]  like, and I think the M3 Pro, those are the systems for most
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.600]  people to get. And I know you and I have just spent half the
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.880]  podcast talking about how we love to load up on thousands of
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.320]  dollars of extra RAM for our browser tabs. But the truth is,
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.320]  Apple Silicon machines do swap so fast because of the SSD
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.240]  performance and everything being integrated in a tight way, that
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:04.600]  even if you are a browser hoarder, like we are, the 36 or
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.200]  20, even 24 gigs of RAM is really pretty good. It's not like
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.240]  your machine's going to bog down because you have a bunch of
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.120]  tabs. But it just seems like that's the sweet spot for most
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.800]  users. And you can go up to 36. That's plenty of RAM for most
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.120]  people.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.480]  Yeah, and it's an improvement over the last gen, which was 32,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.800]  which was where you could max out on the Pro. So you're
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.720]  getting more RAM. And I will say it's a $2,000 price difference
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.280]  if you're going to go for like the so an M3 Pro with 12 core,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.800]  36 gigs of RAM and a two terabyte SSD, that is like $3,200.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.120]  And if you get one that is like the model that can go up to 128
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.080]  gigs of RAM, and a two terabyte SSD, that's $5,100. So you're
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.880]  talking about like literally $2,000 difference to have that
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:57.320]  RAM increase. And if you go from 36 to 64 gigs, that's still
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.440]  like $1,000, $1,200. So it's a, I think you're right. I think
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.160]  they're making a much bigger differentiation between the
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.360]  kind of the Pro and the Max. And that's very evident in the
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.480]  pricing, frankly.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.600]  Yeah, the sweet spot for most people is the M3 Pro chip and
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.320]  those configurations. And there's this, this almost a
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.480]  chasm, it pricing wise, once you go beyond that. And so if
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.680]  you've either got the money and like me have more money than
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.880]  cents and want to spend it anyway. But for most people,
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.160]  when they hear, Oh, that's $1,000 or $2,000 difference,
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.240]  they're like, Oh, not for me, I'll take the other ones
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.720]  forget, you know, right. It's all right. It's not like, Oh,
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.840]  it's only $200 more. And then they're like, Oh, I wasn't gonna
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.560]  spend that much. Right? No, I'll get it. Yeah, no, they're
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.560]  making it very clear, because it's basically like, you could
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.600]  get another laptop. And, and that's honestly not, that's not
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.080]  even a bad way to look at it. Honestly, no, that's honestly a
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.960]  way you go, Okay, you know what, you might want to just get
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.800]  like, a well configured like MacBook Air, as well as this
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.280]  thing, if you really, you know, you could do that for the same
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.000]  prices, getting the max. And so if you don't need all of that,
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.680]  yeah, honestly, now that I'm thinking about that, I'm still
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.960]  gonna size queen, but I'm still going to do that. But I think
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.520]  better for other people, if you're like, Okay, you could get
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.760]  two laptops, right? The same price, I guess, basically, it's
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.080]  like, okay, m three, that's our consumer chip. Yeah, now we put
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.880]  this chip into a pro body at $1600. And what's the upgrade
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.640]  to go from eight to 16? With that machine, probably $200?
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.280]  Yeah, right. So So what is it? $1800? Right? 1799. That's a
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.080]  really good laptop, though. It is one to once you bump that up
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.200]  to 16 gigs of RAM. And actually, when you do that, yeah,
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.600]  it's $200 to go to 16 gigs of RAM. And it's $400 to go to 24.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.080]  So depending, right, although again, I still think, if you're
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.000]  really looking at at that point, get a MacBook Air. But yeah,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.240]  but it's a good deal. The M three Pro is a great chip for
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.400]  most people who are looking for a pro budgeted laptop. And then
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.880]  the M three max is really where they're like, flexing. Yes,
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.400]  they're they're just like these, there is no comparable laptop
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.080]  hardware like this on the Intel side of the fence. There is no
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.360]  competition and or there's competition, but there's nothing
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.200]  that's in the same ballpark. This is a total flex. It is
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.120]  where Apple is strongest with laptops, right? Everybody knows
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.200]  that with the desktops, they're high end, pro level money is no
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.760]  object graphics performance is just not in the same ballpark as
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:50.040]  Nvidia yet. Right? It might be another generation or two. I
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.200]  maybe never who knows if they're going to catch up, but they're
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.040]  not. So that's, that's not Apple strength. But laptop performance
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:03.640]  is Apple. And they're flexing really, really well. And again,
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.600]  there were so many, I just want to say before we, you know, move
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.000]  past this whole segment, I was predicting I wrote a whole column
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.560]  last week saying maybe they're just going to have em twos. And
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.480]  this is they're calling it scary fast, because they just want to
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.400]  keep, you know, because if the M three isn't coming till next
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.880]  year, they just want to spin the M two is still pretty good,
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.680]  which it would be. And it is if you're buying like a MacBook
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.760]  Air, it's fine. It's really, really good. It is really,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.760]  really impressive. I just I feel like maybe I haven't taken
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.880]  enough time in this show to just say this is really impressive
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.840]  that they're not just launching the M three and three nanometer
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:48.040]  for Apple silicon in 2023. They're doing it with the pro
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.800]  and the max chips too. And they it's really they're they're
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.400]  execution wise, operationally, whatever you want to say, they
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.720]  are on all cylinders. Yeah,
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.040]  I did want to ask you about that. Because in that column,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.680]  one of the best arguments I thought you made about why we
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.120]  might not see an M three pro and three max this time was the
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.640]  the vision Pro, which is supposed to be M two. Now, my
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.360]  question for you is, do you think they change that?
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.680]  That's I have gotten so many I have friends who are hitting me
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.480]  up now I've got a guest on the show hitting me up with this
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.360]  question. People I'm asked about it is a super good question.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.280]  Would they say okay, yes, we told you back in June attempt
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.080]  to but surprise, it's going to have an M three. I guess it's
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.640]  possible, right? I mean, it's certain nobody's going to be
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.200]  disappointed if they said that right now. Like, and the way
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:48.520]  that that Apple silicon works, developer wise, I don't think
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.560]  it would cause any like a line of code change to anybody, any
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.520]  developer who's like gone all in on developing for vision Pro,
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:06.120]  trying to be there on day one with either an all new app or
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.880]  some app that they want to bring to the vision Pro, quote unquote
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:15.960]  early next year. And they've spent every day since WWDC
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.400]  working on it, and they've gone to the lab, and maybe maybe
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:25.240]  they've qualified for the secretive program where they can
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.240]  get pre release hardware. I don't think saying okay, we're
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.600]  going to ship it with the M three instead of the M two is
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.880]  going to cause any problems. It's not like Oh, I'd optimize
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.280]  for the M two. No, that's not the way Swift UI works or nothing
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.040]  nothing works like that. It's all just better. So I guess it's
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.480]  possible. And if that was their plan all along, of course, they
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.040]  weren't going to say that back in June, right? But there is a
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.800]  tiny little credibility issue with doing that, right? It's
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:05.640]  like it. The I don't know how to say it. There's there's a part
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:09.800]  of that that would rub me the wrong way where Apple says
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.800]  blank, they do blank, right? They and it doesn't matter what
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.920]  blank is, they follow through. But I don't see how else they
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.720]  could if the plan all along was to have an M three and division
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.600]  Pro, quote unquote, early next year. I don't know how else
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.080]  they could have done it because they couldn't say well, they
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.920]  could they I shouldn't say can't but they wouldn't say it's
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.400]  going to have the M three when nothing else is shipping with
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.480]  the M three ad and it wasn't going to be announced till the
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.160]  end of October. And I also don't think they could have not
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.400]  mentioned what chip it has, right? Right. They can't say
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.600]  it's going to ship with a great Apple silicon chip and the
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:50.360]  revolutionary r one chip for the low latency camera to all the
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.400]  stuff the r one does. Because if they hadn't said if they just
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.960]  said it's going to have Apple silicon, everybody would have
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.920]  guessed Oh, it's the M three, right? So I guess they could,
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.600]  but I kind of think it's still going to be the M two. I really
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.720]  wouldn't want to bet on this, Christina. To me, I'm like 5050
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.640]  on this. I kind of am too. And I get your perspective about
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.360]  like feeling maybe sort of misled and whatnot. At the same
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.680]  time, I feel like if they could swap this out with an M three,
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.720]  I feel like that would just be a win, especially since the
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.160]  the price of the vision Pro being what it is and the fact
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.080]  that it's a niche device. I will say as someone who is
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.720]  unclear whether I'm going to be getting one or not. And
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.720]  actually, if I'm buying this laptop, that's probably more in
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.560]  favor of the me not getting a vision Pro at least at the
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.240]  offset. We'll have to wait to see but I would say that it
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.480]  would be something that would annoy me if I'm looking at
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.160]  Okay, yeah, I'm spending $3700 on this thing and I don't even
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.480]  have the latest chip like that. It starts at $3500. Right,
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.880]  right, right. So I'm starting at this and I don't even have
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.760]  the latest chip and I feel like that would be honestly I think
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.480]  that would annoy me more than whatever disingenuous or
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.520]  obfuscation they said about the chip when it came out. It's
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.320]  also possible. And we don't know TSMC had delays and they
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.160]  had their own issues. And I wonder too, given the fact that
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.520]  this event, that they did this on a Monday night, the whole
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.320]  way this was done, this is coming in really hot, at least
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.480]  it seems like it obviously they've had these things ready
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.240]  to go for weeks because they hasn't produced them all. But
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.320]  it does strike me as this was something that didn't. And even
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.640]  the the various rumors being conflicted, I think shows that
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.720]  this was not kind of a guaranteed thing that they were
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.160]  going to hit November to launch these chips. So potentially,
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.080]  it's one of those things where they were kind of hedging and
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.960]  like, okay, we don't want to pre announce or pre do anything
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:52.120]  because we don't know if these will be out by the time vision
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:52.760]  Pro is out.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.880]  I sort of think it comes down to and this is far way complete,
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.840]  I would say completely outside my area of expertise, hard
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.160]  computer hardware engineering. I think it I think maybe it
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.560]  ultimately comes down to like, like, like I just said a couple
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.080]  of minutes ago from a software developer side, you really don't
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.680]  need to worry about which right, which M series chip and
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.320]  this is true for all of Apple silicon is for iPhone chips,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.360]  too, right? You don't have to target the A17 Pro or the A16
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.600]  or A15. You just write compile for Apple silicon, and it runs
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.040]  great. The newer faster the chip, the faster your software
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:35.320]  runs. Great. I but for hardware engineering, like the hardware
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:39.000]  engineers making the vision Pro, this is what I just don't know.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.280]  Like maybe it's the case that to eke out all of the battery
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.880]  life and the thermals of this thing that's on your face,
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.600]  right? So the thermals are super, super important, right?
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.680]  There's some kind of fans, like what do they call it? They
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.200]  don't call them fans, but active cooling system or whatever
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.000]  they call it, right, right, right. It needs to be cool. And
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.040]  so it and if it's all packed into this tiny little thing in
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.400]  front of your face, maybe the lead time on eking out every
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.680]  single ounce of performance is such that they kind of needed
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:22.600]  to design this thing for the known M2 chip 18 months ago.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.040]  Yeah. And there's they can't they can't just say, okay, now
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.840]  we can just take that out like a Lego, right and put the M3 in
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:35.080]  there. Like hardware, I think maybe doesn't work like that. So
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.520]  if you really made me bet right now, I think the vision pro
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.680]  will ship with the M2 as they promised I because I kind of
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.120]  think that it has that kind of lead time. No, I mean that
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.280]  that's a really good point. Because as much as these as
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.160]  similar to these chips are, like you said, from a software
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.720]  perspective, I don't know anything about the cooling. I
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:56.680]  don't know, especially since the nanometer size is different
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.320]  that would negate it from being a plug and play sort of thing.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.120]  And so if they're going to have to go back and and do
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.840]  significant retooling, which again, they might have already
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.040]  been in the process of doing, who knows, but if they weren't,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.920]  then I would I would tend to agree with you make it difficult
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.640]  for them to make a switch like that. And I think that if you're
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.760]  if we look at the base level performance, as much as Apple
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.560]  loves to show their graphs and talk about how much better
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.320]  performances and use big, you know, two and a half times 40%
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.640]  better this and that. I don't think that it's going to be that
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.880]  significant for a again, like from from a user perspective,
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.720]  right, especially if the hardware is being or the
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.720]  software is being used the way that it is. And so, yeah, I
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.840]  think that's probably a good point.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.640]  Speculating on exactly this point with readers and Mastodon
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.920]  followers, and everybody asking me, do you think that if they do
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:52.760]  go to M3 for the Mac, they'll upgrade the Vision Pro to M3
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.360]  automatically, or whatever you want to say. I went back and
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.040]  reread the Vision Pro marketing page on the website and went
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.360]  down to the performance section. And it's also matches what I
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:10.920]  remember from the the spiel during the WWDC keynote that
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.520]  and I also I don't think it's spin. I think it's true that the
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.800]  performance story for Vision Pro is more about the R1 than the
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.880]  M chip, whatever M chip it is. And it is still the CPU and it
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.840]  is the GPU. And so it's not like CPU and GPU don't matter on the
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.800]  Vision Pro, but it's the R1. Yeah, that really sets it apart.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.920]  They don't brag like they like Steve Jobs, nobody can brag like
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.720]  Steve Jobs did. But Steve Jobs when they announced the original
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:49.320]  iPhone and said we're five years ahead of the nobody else's
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.840]  within five years of the iPhone, which kind of turned out to be
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.200]  true. I don't know, I think that the best Android phone that was
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.880]  comparable, it wasn't quite five years. I remember kind of doing
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.240]  ballpark math for performance and specs and stuff. It was
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.200]  probably two and a half, three, or three or four, three, four, it
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.920]  depends which Android phone you want. I was gonna say, I think
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.720]  that by the time they got to the their own chips, once they got
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.960]  to the iPhone four, I don't think it was a competition
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.440]  anymore. I think that once it was, but why? But the the first
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.760]  iPhone, they were so far ahead from the user experience, and
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.120]  the passive screen and everything else. And then Android
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.640]  ships a year later, it is not in a place where it could really
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.680]  compete then. So you are really at two years, I think probably
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.960]  before Android could could even be quasi in the same
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.400]  conversation. But I think that once Apple started doing its own
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.840]  chips, like that, that was a completely different ballgame.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.760]  But I yeah, I get I just get the feeling like if you pose that
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:52.280]  question to Rockwell or Jaws or Tim Cook, or whoever you thought
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.560]  would give a good answer, where where do you think Vision Pro is
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:00.520]  the furthest ahead of any other company in the headset space? I
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.880]  think the R1 chip would be their answer as to where they're the
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.240]  furthest ahead. And it combines with the displays, but they're
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.960]  not making the displays, they're buying the displays from Sony,
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.320]  and they might be buying all of them, you know, sort of like the
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.320]  way they've sort of like the way they've effectively bought up
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.520]  all of TSMC's three nanometer production for the near term.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:26.120]  So it is so those displays inside the Vision Pro are sort
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.000]  of an Apple exclusive, but because they're not the ones who
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.960]  make them, whereas the R1 is their design, and it's all
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.720]  theirs, mine, mine, mine, nobody else has the R1. But I kind of
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.440]  feel like that's the performance story. And that's how they'll
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.320]  well, how are they going to debut this thing with an M2?
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:47.960]  It's $3500. And by the earliest they're going to do it is
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.320]  January, right? And so it'll already be three months, not the
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.080]  latest and greatest. And that's if it is January, you know,
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.000]  February or March totally.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.440]  I think you make a great point. I think the thing there too. I
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.920]  mean, like I said, this is just me is more like being annoyed
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.040]  from like a looking at as a consumer who's all about speeds
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.760]  and feeds, although that shouldn't really necessarily be
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.240]  what we judge it on. But your point look, even though they
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.240]  don't make the screens, Sony does that R1 is why you have
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.840]  why you have the low latency and why you have the refresh
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.800]  rate. I haven't experienced Vision Pro, but everybody who
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.320]  I've talked to has been blown away. And the fact that the
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.120]  clarity is what it is, the responsiveness is what it is.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.640]  That's what sells it the same way that the Apple didn't make
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.240]  the first chip in the iPhone, right? But it was the
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.640]  responsiveness of the UI, it was the fact that you could
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.760]  push to zoom, it was that whole fluid thing, even though you
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:46.280]  didn't have multitasking, and you couldn't send an MMS or
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:51.560]  or like, like, there were there were deficiencies, but it
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.000]  didn't matter. Because the interface, I mean, it was just
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.320]  such a didn't have apps, but it was such a huge step forward.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.400]  And then I think that the only company that is is conceivably
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.000]  even in the conversation is meta. And what they're doing
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.960]  with like the Quest Pro three and and and all that stuff is
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.280]  like not even it's, again, it's not even in the same
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.080]  conversation. Like it's like, it's like, okay, well, this is
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.840]  cute. This is the one that was actually going to go forward.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.160]  And that's because they've got the entire experience there.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.600]  So maybe it doesn't really matter, like the technicalities
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.760]  of what chip is in it, as long as they can get all those
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.000]  things working together to deliver that experience, because
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.360]  that's what's going to make or break the vision Pro is that
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.320]  experience.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.920]  Yeah, and I just kind of and I'd be happy if I'm wrong, that
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:40.440]  if they can make them as fast as they want, but I just kind
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:46.120]  of feel from it. It's largely based on on the supply chain
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.880]  rumors about these displays, right? But the displays will be
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.520]  the constraining element of this whole thing. And I kind of
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.880]  feel like there will be enough demand and you know, for this
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.520]  first generation one that I, I think it's going to be back
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.280]  ordered all year. Oh, yeah. And maybe we'll loosen up by the
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.560]  time Christmas rolls around. But then by that time, it'll be
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.280]  10 months old. And it's questionable whether people
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:17.320]  should be buying it or waiting for vision Pro two or the, of
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:21.000]  course, non pro version of the thing, which Garmin's already
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.080]  got some reports about that one of the ways they're going to
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:28.680]  save money is not having the front facing eyesight display.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.400]  But I really think that they're going to be, they're going to
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:35.240]  sell them as fast as they can make them at $3,500 all year
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.960]  long, whether it has the M2 or not, they could actually I
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.760]  honestly think that they could say, you know what, we actually
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.760]  downgraded it to the M1.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.680]  I think you're right. I think you're right. And in fact, I'm
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.400]  sure that early iterations of it probably were using an M1,
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.280]  right? Like, I mean, I guess Yeah, I mean, that had been
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.040]  right, because as long as they've been working on this, so
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.920]  they, I think, I think to your point, yeah, especially if the
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.080]  supply constraint is going to be those Sony displays. And I'm
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.640]  sure they're buying every single one that Sony can make.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.680]  But you know, just just as for many years, they bought every
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.560]  single sensor that Sony could make for the smartphone cameras
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.400]  and they still buy the majority of the ones that Sony makes
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.000]  there. But yeah, I mean, I think I think that's, yeah, I
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.400]  think that they're not gonna have any problem being sold out
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.080]  on this thing. And again, I don't as much as again, like it
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.280]  would be you feel in some way a little bit of a slight at the
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.440]  other end, if you're buying this product, which starts at
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.360]  $3,500, that is very niche and is going to have a very kind of
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.120]  specific kind of market, at least in the beginning, I think
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.720]  that it, I still stand by the fact that this is as cool as
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:41.400]  this looks, this is still a product that is going to be
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.200]  searching for that product market fit for quite some time.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.640]  I don't know how much it matters with that first gen, it's
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.840]  kind of like the first gen iPad where a lot of us bought it and
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.600]  we loved it and we knew what it represented. But it was that
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.520]  iPad 2 that was really the one that everybody got into that
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.760]  was thinner, that had the better battery life that was was
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.720]  a just leaps and bounds better. But you have to you have to
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.720]  start somewhere. And so it doesn't really matter.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.880]  John Greenewald I'm so glad you thought to bring it up,
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.800]  though, because if we would have ended this show without,
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.080]  without talking about the vision Pro, what are they going to do
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.880]  about the end? Yeah, the vision Pro I would have, I would have
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.600]  lost my mind, I would have like, I would have been like calling
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.920]  you at four in the morning, like, you got to talk about it.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.200]  No, I will hop back on. And
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.200]  Katie Grant Well, no, because that was one of the reasons
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.680]  why I was kind of on team. I don't know if they're gonna
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.120]  release an M3. I know. Because you made a really compelling
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:32.840]  case. I was like, Well,
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.880]  John Greenewald It definitely threw me off. Yeah, I'm happy
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:40.280]  to say I'm wrong. I'm all I'm so glad to be wrong. Because this
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.040]  this M3 lineup is great. And I'm glad I'm glad the pros and the
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.640]  max are out already. And it's all seems too good to be true.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.600]  And again, so much for the supply chain stuff like that
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:56.760]  supply chain rumor was that the a 17 Pro alone was going to max
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.480]  out TSMC is three nanometer production. At least it's scale.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:05.960]  Yeah, apparently not. For this while I mentioned that for the
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.720]  super nerds out there in terms of which three nanometer
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.000]  production process they're on, they would not say so I don't
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.400]  know. And, you know, well, I guess we'll find out somehow
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.000]  soon ish, I guess when people start buying them or somebody
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.120]  takes them apart, but I don't know the answer to that. And
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.840]  quite frankly, I I don't care. I was gonna say I don't care
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.320]  either. I'm just glad we're three nanometer, which is
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.760]  incredibly impressive. That's what ATP is for. Yeah, I was
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.680]  gonna say ATP can get into that. And I fix it, other people can
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.880]  can buy them and deal with them and go through that process of
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.360]  figuring that stuff out, which would be very interesting. I
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.960]  love to learn about it. But I also, I'm with you. I kind of
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960]  don't care. I mean, like I care in terms of like, it's
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.360]  interesting, but it's not going to make any difference to me
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.120]  about the fact that I want this black laptop. All right, let me
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.400]  take a break here and thank our second and final sponsor of
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.040]  this episode. And it is our very good friends. It's the
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.680]  opposite of a first time sponsor. It's our long term
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.520]  friends Squarespace. You guys, of course, know Squarespace if
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.280]  you listen to the show regularly. It is the all in one
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.920]  platform for building your brand and your presence online
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:20.200]  with your own website. Squarespace has everything you
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.040]  need to have your own website, everything from registering
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.040]  domain names, which of course is that's half the battle to
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.600]  picking from dozens, maybe more, maybe 100. I don't know
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.840]  how many templates they have, but it's a lot of them
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.520]  professionally designed templates that you can use as
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.200]  is look totally professional with a design that scales
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.680]  across all devices. They have the new fluid engine. They've
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:50.120]  always had a drag and drop WYSIWYG right in the browser
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.720]  interface for customizing your website, whether it's the
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:58.200]  design, the style, or the features, which features that
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:03.000]  Squarespace has built in things like a blog or a store with a
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.440]  catalog, or you name it, whatever features you might want
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.160]  to have on your website, you do it by drag and drop fluid
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.400]  engine is their name. It is new and the biggest change from
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.840]  their old great, which was great WYSIWYG in browser design
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.520]  engine with the new one is the fluid engine is works just as
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.400]  well on a phone or an iPad by touch as it does on a desktop
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.000]  browser with drag and drop and it's, you know, more and more
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.560]  people are phone first and it's just great. It is really
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:41.160]  almost too good to be true. How much drag and drop design you
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.760]  can get done with the fluid engine on the phone right there
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.200]  with any website in Squarespace. It is just terrific.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.920]  I always say, you know, for people who listen to this show,
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.760]  you've probably are the person in your friend circle and your

[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.720]  thanks to Squarespace for their continuing support of the show.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:01.560]  What were we talking about before I took that break?
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:06.040]  I guess we'd finished up with some of the three nanometer
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.600]  stuff. Oh, that's right. That's right. Oh, here's the I know
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  what I wanted to ask you. Sorry. Keep on this vision Pro,
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.360]  what are they going to do? They can stick with the M2 as they
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.560]  promised? Or are they going to surprise us with an M3? Here's
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.000]  my question on that front. And a lot of people, like I said, a
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.040]  lot, a lot of listeners and readers have been asking me
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:30.840]  about this all week. I'm not at all surprised that they did not
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.200]  mention it in the event, right? And if they're not going to
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.240]  change it, of course they didn't. But let's just say they
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.840]  are. Let's say it is going they are going to happily surprise
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.240]  us and upgrade the original first gen vision Pro to the M3.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.960]  There's no way that they were going to mention it during the
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:51.800]  event tonight, because right event was focused on things you
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.880]  could buy and it was all Mac, all Mac, and all stuff that's on
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.680]  sale as you and I speak right now. By the time anybody
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.600]  listens to this, you can already buy it. Everything except the
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.080]  M3 Max is shipping next week. And they told me when they said
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.360]  sometime in November, and apparently not even that late in
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.240]  November, I don't know, like middle of the month that the M3
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.920]  Max configurations aren't going to be that far behind, but they
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.600]  wouldn't say exactly. But there's no way they were going
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.040]  to mention that in the in the in the show. It's too distracting,
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:27.640]  right? Because it's the big shiny thing on the horizon. It's
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.760]  it's it's it's like looking into the sun and then trying to
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.480]  look at something else. You're once they mentioned vision Pro,
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.120]  even at the end, everybody's going to forget about all this
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:40.040]  great new Mac stuff. But here's my question, would would they
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.560]  wait until the second the the launch event of the Vision Pro
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.720]  and surprise us right there on stage? Or would they make like
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.360]  a press release announcement later this month and just say,
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.640]  Oh, by the way, customers love the M3 is when there are new
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.320]  MacBook Pros and the new IMAX. And we're happy to say it's
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:05.800]  going to be in the Vision Pro in a press release to sort of
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.040]  take that just not not to take it off the table, but to sort
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:18.360]  of reduce the enthusiasm for Vision Pro. I think that they
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.800]  would say it at like the main event, like I think that it
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.320]  would be one of those like special like and and one more
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.960]  thing. And guess what, it's even better than we promised,
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.840]  right? Because then then I feel like that would be like it
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.800]  would make people even more exuberant. Like not only are we
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.280]  bringing this out within the timeframe we said we were going
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.360]  to and it's going to have all this stuff, but we made it even
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.680]  better. When we started this out, we said that it was going
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.480]  to be the M2. But now we've actually been able to get the
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.360]  latest processors latest and greatest in these headsets. So
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.600]  it's going to be even more powerful, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:55.480]  blah, blah. That was my first thought, but then I thought,
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:59.240]  but but they're all pre recorded now. So they can't do
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.280]  it. They're not going to be able to play for applause. Right?
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:07.560]  Yeah, that's true. So I've kind of my first thought was that
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.720]  they'll save it for the event, because I know they're going to
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.120]  have another event. And people have even asked me, do you think
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.200]  they're going to have another event? And of course they will,
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.560]  right? It's the playbook is the Apple Watch playbook. You
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.960]  announce the product one year and say it's coming next year.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.000]  And then when it comes the next year, then you have a dedicated
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.880]  event just for that product. That's exactly what they did
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:35.320]  with Apple Watch in 2014. Introduction slash 15 when it
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:39.960]  shipped or what are 13 and four, whatever two years it was. And
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:42.200]  they're going to do that again. They're going to have a special
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.840]  event is surely at Steve Jobs Theater for the media, just for
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:50.920]  the vision pro quote unquote early next year. I could see
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.680]  them waiting for it, but I kind of wonder, I kind of feel like
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.720]  they're sneaky that way where they'd love to have like a
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.760]  little, Hey, you know, the vision pro, which is going to be
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.640]  awesome, which was going to be awesome. Just the way we promised
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:15.320]  it is going to be awesome. I don't know. Yeah. But just after
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:21.080]  the enthusiasm for these M3 Mac announcements cools off, that
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.800]  would be the time that I would expect something like that.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.680]  That's true. I mean, and I think you bring up a good point that
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.960]  these are no longer live events, which is sad to me, because that
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.600]  would be it would be a great mic drop moment, right? Like these
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:35.960]  are things would be great with with an actual audience. I hope
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.160]  that we can get back to that point someday. Like I like that
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.040]  they can do these highly produced things. I also do miss
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:48.200]  the the experience of live to be honest, right? So, but but
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.680]  that's a good point. Without having that benefit of live. I
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:54.600]  do think that you do lose a tremendous amount of the, but
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.760]  wait, there's more aspects. So yeah, I think that's true. I
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.640]  think that maybe when things are tapered down, that would be good
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.360]  almost like what we call like a second day story way to like
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.520]  juice the cycle once more.
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.840]  So I don't know, I say stay tuned. But it's exciting,
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.960]  because we don't know. Yeah, it's exciting. I kind of thought
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.840]  this whole event was kind of fun, because we didn't know what
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.720]  was coming. And yes, we're all over the map. I was gonna say
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.120]  that was the fun thing about this is that this is first time
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.040]  in a really long time where there was a lot of just, there
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.280]  were conflicting reports, and we didn't know what it was going
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.520]  to be. And we knew it was gonna be max. I mean, they made that
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.520]  clear. And by showing the the black finder, I was like, Okay,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.400]  are we going to get a black MacBook? Like that was my
[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.960]  deepest, like, like, want. But but I still, to be completely
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.680]  honest, like, I was like, Well, I really want a black MacBook,
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.160]  but I did not. I was like, they're probably just going to
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.880]  give us like another colored iMac or something. Right. Right.
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.000]  And I was pleasantly surprised. But yeah, this was nice. This
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.840]  was one of those nice things that a kind of came out of
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.680]  nowhere. Be it was a last minute sort of thing. See, okay,
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.240]  we can talk about the fact that it was a little bit weird to do
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.560]  this on a Monday night. But yeah, I'll also say they did it
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.640]  in half an hour. Like it was very tight 30 minutes, which I
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.760]  very much applaud them for as somebody who's worked on events
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.440]  both pre recorded and not like to get that in into a 30 minute
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.280]  like tight like way that it was done was good. It flowed well.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.040]  And it was it was a nice surprise. Like it was a not
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.720]  something we were expecting is usually we know well in advance
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.760]  if they're going to be doing these Mac events. And this was
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.240]  this was a nice surprise, especially the fact that we got
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.240]  so much right. Like I I was kind of expecting just kind of like
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.800]  a mediocre kind of traditional like spec bump. And it wasn't
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.760]  that I think that the fact that we killed the touch bar finally
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:48.520]  rest in hell, die in a fire never come back. God I hate the
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:52.040]  touch bar. I don't hate the touch bar itself. I don't but I
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.440]  also don't love it. I'm like the only person who's like
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.320]  ambivalent and I've been I've felt the same way about it ever
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.360]  since the first launch. Yeah, it's like I tried with it. I
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.280]  really tried to make it work. The only good thing about the
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.600]  touch bar, there were two good things. One was the fingerprint
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.840]  sensor, which was obviously like, amazing. And two was I did
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.320]  really appreciate it was a very easy way to raise the
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.520]  brightness or the volume on your laptop. Like that was I
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:17.640]  would use the sliders for that everything else. I was like,
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.560]  yeah, this is going to get in my way. But you know, like they
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.520]  but they gave us with this event, like, it looks like
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.520]  there's some real performance improvements. But also like,
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.600]  this was a really solid lineup of, I think, making the Mac
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.200]  lineup finally unified. I'm a little disappointed that they
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.800]  never took like a second crack at the at the touch bar. Yeah,
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.360]  right. That they just sort of like, Oh, well, forget it. I
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:44.600]  don't know. And I wonder, like, did they have like, I'm sure
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.200]  they had ideas. Oh, yeah, far. How far did they take them for
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.880]  like, okay, okay. The first one wasn't that great. But But what
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.560]  if but what if and reimagined? I wonder, I wonder if the touch
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.640]  bar was so associated with the butterfly keyboard that you
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.080]  know what I mean? Even though they were separate, but I
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.240]  wonder if it was so associated with that, that it was like,
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.880]  okay, we need to just get away from this as quickly as
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.840]  possible. The one thing weird about the touch part of me
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.000]  always and this actually was the case. I remember when Apple
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  showed it to me at like the event because I had to fly out
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.080]  to see it. I think I could have gone locally, but I think I flew
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.480]  out to look at the Mac event. I remember this because
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.560]  Microsoft had an event the day before and then I had to get on
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.840]  an airplane and like fly across the country to go see the
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.640]  laptops was that the touch bar more than any other laptop
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.120]  experience I'd ever had maybe for the first time actually
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.160]  touched the screen of my MacBook, which is not a mistake
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.920]  I've ever made. But there was this weird kind of disconnect.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.920]  I was like, okay, you're trying to do this. But if you to me,
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.400]  it's like shit or get off the pot, like either put a
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.080]  touchscreen on the Mac, which I think is inevitable at some at
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:56.280]  a certain point, or don't. But it felt like it was again, kind
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.320]  of like this halfsies thing that they didn't really succeed
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.440]  either way. But I did appreciate being able to raise the volume
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.720]  or the brightness on my laptop. And obviously having the
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:08.840]  fingerprints insert was great. What else did you think about
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.480]  the broadcast? Whatever you want to call the keynote? What
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.880]  about the Halloween spooky framing? That was cute. That was
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.200]  cute. It was a little bit distracting at some points that
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.280]  they had like the background like the Halloween like
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.560]  background music going on like throughout the entire time. I
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.440]  was like, okay, that that is a choice. But I did appreciate
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.600]  that. I thought that with the whole black thing like that,
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.280]  that fit the time of year, the way they kind of swooped in on
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.480]  Tim, I wish he'd been wearing like a Dracula costume or
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.200]  something like I think that was really, really, you really
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.520]  wouldn't know if you were there. You would have I mean, I
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.560]  mean, yes, but but but no, Tim Cook is never going to do that.
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.200]  I'm just saying like, I appreciate like, they leaned
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.400]  into the camp a little bit more. I wouldn't have been mad.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.880]  But I also wouldn't expect them to write because it's Apple.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.920]  But no, I thought I thought was well. So I did something
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:01.000]  interesting this year. I did not this event rather. I did not
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.800]  watch it on like the official app website or the app, the TV
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:09.160]  app, I watched it on YouTube. And I found that to be a better
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:13.000]  experience and have less of the latency issues that sometimes
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.520]  happens from the official apps because they struggle with
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.040]  their CDN stuff to be able to get it out to as many people and
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.760]  so you will have an instance where I will have it up on three
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.800]  different devices. And it'll be at different points on every
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.720]  single device with with however much of a buffer there might be.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:32.360]  And and I tried this and I was like, let's see what the
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.600]  YouTube thing is like. And look, you can make a lot of
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.800]  criticisms about YouTube and I definitely have. But the one
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.160]  thing they know how to do correctly is like video and
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.080]  especially live streams. And so I do it. I did appreciate that
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.520]  they've started to simulcast these things because frankly,
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:51.880]  like, yeah, use Google servers. I mean, have your own do your
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:55.080]  own thing. But but use somebody who's like, this is literally
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.440]  what they're the best in the world at. I think it's telling
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.080]  that unless I'm missing somebody, everybody puts their
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.480]  stuff on YouTube. Oh, yeah. I mean, Apple, the fact that
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:10.680]  Apple live streams it on YouTube. I know Microsoft puts
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.480]  all of their stuff on YouTube, you know, and that was a fight
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.720]  keynotes. That was a fight it that I think meta does meta
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.760]  does everybody does. And I have to say I can speak for the
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.120]  Microsoft part of it because when I worked there, there was
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.240]  a contention of executives who did not want to do anything on
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:31.320]  YouTube because right predator and I very I didn't know what I
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.040]  was getting into this was for Microsoft build the first year
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.120]  that I was involved in and stuff like that. So this was
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:40.840]  2018. I was very like loud and like vociferous. I was like, we
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.400]  have to be on YouTube. This is where everyone goes. This is
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.440]  the number two search engine in the world. I don't we can use
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.840]  our own player and whatnot, but we have to have this content
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.120]  there. And we have to simulcast because this is literally where
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.800]  everyone is. And not only that, but our own platform at the
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.360]  time that Microsoft owned, they had a mixer, which was like
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:01.560]  their take on Twitch didn't actually fit the accessibility
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.920]  requirements that the company had. So that was how I was able
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.960]  to win was I was there like, Oh, we have to we should live
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.200]  stream on mixer. And I was like, Okay, so are we going to
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.520]  burn the captions? Like, what are we going to do? Because it
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:16.200]  doesn't match our company's accessibility requirements. So
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.760]  we could just use YouTube. One, but but that was that was a
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:23.880]  hard thing to get over. But although now like six years
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.160]  later, no one would question it. Right. And I think even that
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.560]  says a lot about Apple, the fact that they will live stream
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.040]  their events there, because I think you just at a certain
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.320]  point have to recognize how important the destination is.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.880]  And I don't I don't think anybody at Apple is happy about
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.160]  it. But I think they also I don't think there's any real
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.200]  debate anymore. I don't know when there was I'm sure there
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.320]  was like, because none of those companies like each other. I
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.720]  don't know, draw connections between them. And there's some
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.480]  where there's sort of detente, right? Like, Apple and Amazon. I
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:00.440]  don't know, they're not really enemies. But they're also not
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.720]  really partners, I guess app, supposedly, maybe still uses
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.760]  AWS for some of the back end. But I don't think they know, I
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.920]  think that's less and less. It's less and less. From what I
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.520]  understand, they still use AWS, and they still use GCP for some
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.800]  things, but more and more of it, I'm sure is their own. But
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.200]  no, I mean, those those are things that are always like, I
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.800]  work at GitHub, where we are, like, we have to be agnostic
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.280]  kind of everyone, although I'm sure plenty of companies hate
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.640]  that they put their source code on us. But they're also kind of
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:30.200]  like, Okay, well, what else are we going to do with it? Like,
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.000]  if we want people to actually be able to access this and, and
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.480]  share about it, like, it's kind of a similar situation to
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.400]  YouTube, like you kind of have to be there. And it is is Yeah,
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.560]  so GitHub is to source code what YouTube is to video.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.560]  Basically, yeah, I enjoy it. Because I can be like, kind of,
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.320]  I feel like I'm Switzerland, right? Like, I don't have to
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.000]  pick a side. I'm like, Hey, we want everybody. We don't care
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.200]  who you are. Just post your code. You host your code with
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:00.280]  us. But yeah, I was I watched on YouTube. And I was very happy
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.480]  with that experience. And I'm glad that they are now
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:06.360]  simulcasting that like, I am sure they're not happy about it.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.960]  But again, like, good. That's the better user experience
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:10.440]  decision.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:15.240]  Which is it just me, I kind of feel like maybe one of the bits.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.960]  It's not quite campiness. And it certainly wasn't a costume.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.880]  But I kind of feel like, in my opinion, Johnny Suruji is a bit
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.200]  of a scary dude. Yeah. He always always and I kind of feel
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.320]  like they he played it up on this. He was like, Welcome to
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.440]  my lab. Yes. Yeah. And I almost feel like it sort of played up
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:38.280]  his Israeli accent is sort of Transylvanian. You know,
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.680]  actually, that's a good point. Welcome to my underground
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.640]  laboratory. And it's like, I have all he has an intensity
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.040]  always has every time he's in a keynote, there's a certain
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:53.000]  intensity to him that I'm like, Whoa, dude, chill out. But I'm
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.560]  glad you're there. Because maybe that intensity is what's
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.720]  driving their silicon forward. I'm sure it is insane pace. But
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.720]  it is his intensity matched the Halloween spooky theme of this
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.680]  in a way. And and his counterpart on hardware, john
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:12.280]  tournes. Yeah, comes across as like, Oh, what a nice guy. I'd
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.520]  love to put my arm around him and have a beer with john
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:17.240]  tournes. What I was gonna say, I was gonna say it was a nice
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.480]  dichotomy there. It really was kind of a great trick or treat
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.400]  thing. And I do have to give them credit. Like if you're
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.160]  gonna do the event on a Monday night, if you're gonna like lean
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.920]  into the dark theme, like, you know, like, well done. Again. I
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.800]  think this is about as campy as Apple could go, which is fine.
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.720]  But I didn't hate it. I, I still think it's so weird for
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.800]  them to do a night event. Yeah, I do too. I guess I think
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.280]  ultimately, it just came down to, well, if we're going to play
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.680]  into the Halloween theme, why don't we broadcast it at night
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:51.720]  too? Right? Yeah. The only thing was, sorry, go ahead. We're at
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.120]  the timing, like 8pm. Eastern. That's one thing. But I'm
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.760]  thinking like, okay, this is like, two o'clock, three
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.480]  o'clock in the morning in Europe. Right? That's the that
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:03.960]  was the only part of it that was weird for me was like, okay,
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.080]  because I'm on the West Coast. So for me, it was fine. But on
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.400]  the East Coast, primetime, whatever, but and then I'm
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:12.760]  thinking, okay, so to me, it really did kind of strike me as
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.400]  okay, this is a very US centric event, maybe more than even any
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.280]  of their others, just because the timing was definitely not
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:20.920]  European friendly.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.080]  Yeah, but on the other hand, Apple is so worldwide now that
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.880]  they can never win, right? So when they have when they have a
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:36.360]  10am Pacific keynote, that's one Eastern and that means I just
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:39.560]  know this because I do dithering with Ben Thompson. It's like
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.720]  seven. Taiwan. No, Taiwan is exactly 12 hours apart from from
[01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:49.560]  the East Coast, right? Right. Except for the four months of
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:53.160]  the year when we're in not in daylight savings time, then it's
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.440]  11 hours difference. I forget. I already forget which way it
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.200]  goes. But close enough. It's 12 hours difference. So like Ben
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.920]  and I usually record dithering at 8pm. My time, he wakes up,
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:08.920]  takes his kids to school, and it's 8am his time. But it's it's
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.600]  such an easy way for me. I'm not good at time zones. I even just
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.160]  going from East Coast to West Coast. I'm always confused.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.920]  Like, it's like, I've done it for so many times, so many
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.960]  years. It's just three time zones or four time zones in the
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:27.960]  US. But I've still after all these years, I'll like, get a
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.560]  phone call from my wife. And I'm like, you're still up. And it's
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.480]  like, yeah, she'll be like, it's, you know, it's like five
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.040]  o'clock in California. She's like, it's eight o'clock. I
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.320]  don't go to bed. I'm like, Oh, yeah, that's right. I still get
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.760]  confused. But you can't win because those those keynotes
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.680]  aren't a good time for Asia. You're right to market. Yeah,
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.480]  yeah, you're right. The year our European friends were the
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.840]  the, the people who had to suffer for this one, though. No,
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:56.680]  for sure. Because it was midnight in the UK and 1am in
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:01.080]  Paris. So one other thing, I've mentioned this a few times
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.640]  recently, and it seems like a lot of other people haven't
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.960]  noticed it. And for some reason, it just sticks out to me. But
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:15.000]  at least for the the entire run of the modern pre recorded Apple
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  keynote for iPhones, every single one of them when they do
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.160]  the iPhone event. kyan drants introduces the non pro models,
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.640]  and it's brightly lit daytime. And then and she goes first
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.360]  because you save the best for last. And then jaws introduces
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.840]  the pro models. And every time in those keynotes, they go to
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.440]  nighttime, and they pretend it's nighttime at Apple Park, and
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.600]  it's dark, right? And we're and even if jaws is standing in
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.440]  front of the same screen or fake screen at CGI dinner, green
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.120]  screened in in Steve Jobs theater, anti rumor, whatever
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.640]  you call that chamber up top. It's dark, and it's nighttime,
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.320]  because dark is pro and light is not. So we've seen Apple Park
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.760]  at in these keynotes at nighttime before, but it's only
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.680]  and always only for the iPhone pro models. So the whole having
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:14.520]  the whole event pretend to be nighttime Apple Park was new. I
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.760]  just kind of feel like they just wanted to shake it up.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.480]  Yeah, yeah, I think that I think they did. And I liked it. I
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.800]  thought that it was good. I was one of those things that made me
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.920]  happy because I was like, Okay, you know what, like, we've seen
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.880]  how you do this the normal way. This is actually really nice to
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:32.520]  see it done a little bit differently. Just because, like
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.520]  I said, I miss the live events. There is, I really respect what
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.840]  they do with their pre records. And I think that they do a
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:41.960]  really nice job. They obviously are very highly produced, very
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.320]  exacting, I do miss the, the live aspect, because I think
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.240]  there's a certain fun that comes with live that you get an energy
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:51.640]  that you miss. But I did appreciate they're like, okay,
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.720]  they're experimenting more, they're able to kind of have
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.480]  fun. I felt like the team who edited it had fun, like that
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.080]  came through. And and I think that came through even like with
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:03.640]  that, that lifted up the entire experience. Here's something
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:06.840]  Did you notice this? Or did you close your YouTube stream
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:10.040]  before the end? I don't even know why I was still watching,
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:13.000]  but I was going waited for the they don't have a lot of
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.080]  credits. But at the end, it said shot on iPhone edited on
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.440]  Mac. So they shot they shot that whole thing on iPhones.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.920]  Oh, I missed that. That's actually that's fantastic.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.760]  It's I would not have guessed by looking at it. It's like,
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.240]  Damn, no, I would not have guessed that either. That's
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.840]  really great, actually. Yeah, really kind of amazing. And I
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.600]  wonder it does shooting at nighttime help with that?
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.160]  Because you don't have to worry so much about depth of field
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:43.960]  and stuff like is that going to be true going forward? I
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:47.080]  wonder but it was I mean, they're they're in a studio
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.320]  environment for I'm sure a lot of it they have even when
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.560]  they're outdoors. They've got massive lights and stuff set
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.800]  up. So I don't know how much that matters, to be honest with
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.840]  you. But but it looked good. It looked great. Yeah, but that is
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.680]  actually amazing that it was shot on. I mean, that's that's
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  a big flux shot on iPhone edited on Mac. Like, obviously,
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.680]  the way that they're going to shoot on an iPhone is going to
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.520]  be different than the way most people can because again,
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:10.680]  they're going to have lights out the wazoo. I will say one of
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:14.280]  the shots. Sorry, go on. Well, I'm just I want to make a joke
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:19.160]  shot on studio display. Okay, see, that would be a horror film
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.680]  truly. Oh, my God, definitely like the Blair Witch. Yeah,
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.920]  like that. Okay, that's good. That's a good shot on studios.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.000]  Like that's the real horror story. Know what I was gonna
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.560]  say, though, is I don't know how much video like for case if
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.400]  you've done on your iPhone 15 Pro Max, but like, you have to
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.720]  basically connect like a external SSD to it if you want
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.520]  to get the best frames. And it's been funny because I've
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.840]  been seeing people do that. And I'm like, yep, this is
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:49.800]  basically the same as with any good actual camera system,
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.160]  which is a similar sort of scenario. So I'm just picturing
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.560]  them on these mounts with maybe I don't know if they had extra
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:59.480]  lenses on top or what they were doing and just SSDs hanging on
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:02.680]  off and things plugged into power and all kinds of stuff.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.320]  I haven't shot like that because I don't do serious
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.040]  video. So I mean, I've shot video with my iPhone 15 Pro,
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.800]  but I don't shoot pro raw, you know? Yeah, I did it just to
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.600]  test it. And it was good because for me is one of those
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.160]  things that was like, I'm thinking about when I do like
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:21.800]  remote video setup stuff for YouTube things that I do, like
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.600]  actually, I think the camera is not good enough that I don't
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.560]  have to travel with my micro four thirds, or whatever the
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.600]  format is that my Sony camera that I don't have to travel
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:36.200]  without anymore. And so, which is just great.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.680]  I'll bet though, now that you bring that up, though, I'll bet
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.360]  that explains why I think this is the first keynote that
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.600]  they've said that about. And I'll bet that's why. Yeah,
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.520]  because this is the first time they have iPhones. Yeah, it's
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.200]  yeah, it's not so much that the camera system and sensor is
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.600]  better, even though they are right incrementally better.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.040]  It's that they can shoot and I linked to stew match, which is
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:01.320]  good Pro lost. I was like, thank you for explaining this
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.360]  to me because I had no idea. But that whole explanation about
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.200]  shooting in that log, which looks off the off the phone
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.880]  looks so desaturated. But that's because you're it's got
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:16.040]  all this data that you can use to color it the way you want.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.760]  So I'll bet that's the explanation for why this is the
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.200]  first one that they've shot on iPhone, because they could
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.400]  shoot it with the iPhone 15 Pro with the SSD shooting and it's
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:35.640]  pro raw, right? Or Yes. Pro res pro res. Yeah, pro raw is the
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.080]  still format. But yeah, the the pro res format and then they
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.120]  can color it perfectly. The coloring is a big deal. I think
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:46.520]  honestly, I think that's the biggest reason why because you
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.840]  would previously be able to use tools like filmic and there's
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.320]  some other third party apps that would be really good. But
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.120]  the fact that you could have in pro res, which means you could
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.560]  natively bring it into Final Cut, and then with the S log be
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.840]  able to color match it to fit what their requirements would
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.720]  be. But it's still really impressive that they did that on
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.720]  the iPhone because I had no idea I would not have expected
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.520]  that. Like I would I would have assumed that they used their
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:12.360]  red systems or whatever they usually use our so one last
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.680]  little postscript to the episode that you and I were
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:19.640]  chatting about before a little bit bittersweet. Matthew Perry
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:25.320]  died what two days ago as we record gut punch ran and of all
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:28.520]  things it was the first person to tell me was my son. He texted
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.160]  the group. He's like Matthew Perry died and it's like oh
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.880]  man and it's like that. I think it's the first time my son ever
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:37.000]  broke bad news to me and he's at college but it's like he I
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.920]  don't know somehow you know he's he's 19. So he's obviously
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:43.720]  on his phone right all the time somehow got the news like
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:48.760]  instantly but man what a gut punch. I love that guy. I'd
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:54.520]  always so funny link to a couple of remembrances. Friends
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.880]  was it's the reason people still watch it. It really is
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:01.960]  just a fantastic show and it's so hard to say oh well Matthew
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.360]  Perry now that he's the first one to die. It's like oh well he
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.960]  was the the linchpin of the whole show. They were every
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.760]  single one of the characters right. They were all essential
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.120]  yeah and you couldn't take any one of them out without the the
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:18.520]  balance falling apart. There was a certain that was it's part
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.160]  of the genius of the show is they got it all the way up to
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.600]  six lead characters who were all essential but I will say
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:31.400]  that the thing for me was that Matthew Perry's Chandler felt
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:36.520]  the most like I identified with him. You know sarcasm. You
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:39.880]  know, I don't know. He was so funny. No and and he really did
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:42.120]  make that role his own. I mean I think that it was Alan
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.520]  Steppenwell who you you've linked to his remembrance and
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.920]  he did point out like he didn't have a lot of lines in the
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.640]  pilot but some of the ones he did he nailed it and that first
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.920]  season which is the first half of that first season. I think
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.720]  it really the show came into its own completely by the time
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.200]  that first season ended but the first probably like six or
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:01.640]  seven episodes. They're all figuring things out and all of
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.560]  them except for Courtney Cox were really green like she had
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:08.920]  tons of experience and she was cast first and and I think if
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.160]  you were gonna argue like who was sort of like especially the
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:14.280]  earlier sort of the lunchman it probably would be her but I
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:17.480]  think that the way that he played his role which could
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.000]  have been this kind of douchebag kind of asshole guy
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.160]  who you don't really like that much. He brought like a sense
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:29.880]  of vulnerability and and humor and just like he was really
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.440]  really good. I always loved Chandler. Chandler was always
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.040]  one of my favorite characters and and he was just you could
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.680]  you got the sense that a lot of the humor really was not from
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:42.840]  the script but was from him and which especially that first
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:48.280]  season like poor Matt LeBlanc was not great at at first which
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.720]  is completely okay. He got very very good but like Matthew
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.400]  Perry like he seemed like a lot of his humor really was
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.040]  completely injected into that script and it it came across
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:00.440]  that way and it was did did your son watch Friends cuz I
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:05.480]  know. Yes. Yeah. No, he did. He did the very now completely
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.480]  stereotypical like thing where like I don't know six or seven
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.840]  years ago like as when he was like thirteen or so. Yeah. Just
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:16.600]  binge the whole thing. Yeah. Start to finish and did the did
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.400]  the thing that everybody my age is like oh my god I'm gonna
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.560]  go. Right. I'm gonna kill you before you're out of the house.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.480]  He was like did you guys ever hear the show Friends and
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:25.720]  you're like I swear to god and and you're like okay you're
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.880]  dead like I'm absolutely like like I'm giving you up for the
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.480]  adoption even though you're thirteen of your friends. I
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:34.040]  yeah. It's like on the one hand I'm so glad he watched it and
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.840]  loved it because my wife and I both liked it. I I would never
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.080]  say it was my all-time favorite show but I watched it you know
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:41.560]  and it was. Everybody watched it. Yeah. I mean how can you
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:44.600]  who didn't watch it and it's like so it's so cool that it's
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.880]  another show. Yeah. That we could talk about but it's like
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.800]  did you guys ever hear of Friends? I was like what do you
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.880]  talk? Well, no, that's the thing. I mean it's hard to
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:54.600]  explain to people who weren't cuz I was I think I was like 10
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.160]  or 11 when it premiered and so it was my my adolescence like
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.360]  that was on basically like like and then it's never not been on
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.320]  the air right. It's it's unfortunately the big bang
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:07.480]  theory is the last great American sitcom in terms of the
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.480]  traditional sense and that's not even a great sitcom but it
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.200]  is the last real one but Friends I think is the last one
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:16.040]  that will like live on forever in in the same way that things
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.480]  like I Love Lucy and All in the Family and things like that
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.400]  like lived on forever like Friends is one of those that
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.200]  you just generationally people just discovered and just
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:27.480]  doesn't matter that it was 30 years ago like it it still
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.520]  works. Yeah. Seinfeld is up there too and they were they
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.080]  were on they were almost like paired together. They were part
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:38.360]  of this Thursday night juggernaut on NBC but in some
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:41.400]  I like Seinfeld better. I did too. I did too. But but but
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.920]  it's Friends has the heart. Yeah and it seems like Friends
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:49.960]  has more legs. Yes. 25 years later, 20 years later. Yeah, it
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:52.440]  does. Well, cuz cuz it's more approachable. I mean,
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:55.320]  Seinfeld had the critical acclaim and obviously it's very
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:58.120]  funny and very good and my favorite show but like but
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.760]  Friends which came out a few years later I think is just
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:04.280]  it's a more accessible show. It's a more mainstream show and
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:07.160]  I think that it was a real testament to like those actors
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:11.480]  frankly and for all negotiating together. So, right. It was
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:17.000]  huge news at the time but that they stuck together and I guess
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  by the end of it, I think it was pretty, I think it was
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.720]  pretty clear by the time they got to like the we're gonna
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.240]  negotiate every year for 20 million dollars. Yeah. Per
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.960]  season or whatever that it was very clear. I think by that
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.760]  time that Jennifer Aniston was the one who's the star. Yeah. I
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.320]  mean, hindsight's 2020 but I think it was clear at the time
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:43.000]  that she had the best chance of becoming like a movie star and
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.680]  did but the fact that they were just like, you know, we're all
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.560]  gonna take the same amount. We're not gonna not one of the
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.600]  six of us is gonna nickel and dime over twenty versus 25
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.320]  million or over and we're all just gonna do it together.
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:58.360]  You're either gonna sign us all for the same amount or rolled
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.760]  out. Which which which worked is honestly what they were going
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:03.800]  to do that for seasons. They were going to cut Matt LeBlanc
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:06.840]  and and David Schwimmer who had come from theater and who I
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.560]  think also probably recognized that even though Ross and
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.680]  Rachel was a great through line. I think he probably was
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:16.920]  smart enough to recognize I don't have the same appeal like
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.360]  on camera or anything else as these other two guys. So, it
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.320]  behooves me for basically he was the one who convinced them
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.560]  all to negotiate together because they had different
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:29.000]  contracts that first season but after the show blew up, they
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.120]  all work together and like they I think they even had like a
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:34.920]  strike or something like where they refused to go in and
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.680]  Warner Brothers was pissed but I mean Warner Brothers has made
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:41.640]  more money off of that show than probably any show in its
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.280]  entire history and and he was a huge part of that and when you
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:47.000]  talk about like movie success, obviously Jennifer Aniston,
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.120]  you're right like she's had a big career but he was in some
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:53.240]  hits like The Last Nine Yards and like a couple other things
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.640]  like he was in were really, really big films and very funny
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.880]  but you and I, we were talking about Studio 60 which is our
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:06.680]  favorite show of his. Yeah. Yeah. And I it warmed my heart
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:09.880]  how many people wrote to me and said, yes, I love that show too
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:13.320]  so many people but and I do think it was so weird. I won't
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.400]  like well, I will. I was going to say I'm not going to rehash
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.040]  what I wrote but I will. I'll just say that it was such a
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.440]  weird show. It was a like a Romana Clef about a Saturday
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:26.920]  Night Live like show except it was in LA, not New York. Right.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:31.320]  But it's the oddest thing is it debuted the exact same year as
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:35.400]  30 Rock. Yup. Which was also about a Saturday Night Live
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:39.720]  like show except was a zany sitcom instead of an Aaron
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:46.120]  Sorkin drama. Right. Same year on the same network, NBC. Yeah.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:50.360]  And I've never, never stopped thinking that there wasn't room
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.200]  for both. There wasn't. There wasn't. And they both hated
[01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:58.360]  that the other was was right. Like Aaron Sorkin was very
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:01.800]  shitty frankly about 30 Rock like he was he was like he and
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:04.920]  the press the time like he kind of like thought that they were
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:08.200]  under beneath him and and I think everybody at the time
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.880]  because you know this is obviously coming off the
[01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.520]  success of of the West Wing and this is his big kind of
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.400]  comeback because he was let go of the West Wing because it was
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.960]  getting caught in the airport with drugs and so this was kind
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:20.120]  of his comeback thing and and the West Wing was obviously
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:24.520]  this massive amazing show and huge hit for NBC and all we
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.480]  knew about Tina Fey was she was a head writer on SNL and and
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:30.680]  she was funny in those sketches but this is 2006 so like she
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.360]  hasn't done the Sarah Palin thing yet right like so it was
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:36.680]  well and and the other thing about 30 Rock. I don't think
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:40.280]  there was II don't I can't recall a show that was like 30
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:43.560]  Rock. No had it had such a different pace. It did. I mean
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:48.040]  it was a little bit like I would say it got a lot of its
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:52.360]  inspiration from Larry Sanders, but it was. Oh right right and
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.600]  faster. I mean that's the thing. Yeah. That's the thing
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.760]  that's insane about 30. I mean again we're talking about
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:59.560]  Matthew Perry and Studio 60, but the thing about 30 Rock is
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:05.640]  the jokes per minute. So so much saying it's just it's even
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:09.640]  to pack that many bad jokes that tightly would be difficult
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.800]  let alone good jokes and it was funny, but that just and it
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:16.520]  took off and it resonated and I kind of feel like it squeezed
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:20.600]  Studio 60 and then and then my other thought is and and again
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:26.440]  this is truly with the benefit of hindsight, but 22 episodes
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:29.240]  in a year of an hour long drama, which used to be the
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:35.240]  standard standard. It isn't sustainable when you're aiming
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.640]  at a much more cinematic writing quality. You just that
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:44.360]  there's a reason why none of today's prestige hour long
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:49.800]  dramas do 20 episodes. Ten is a lot like eight and even most of
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.360]  the ones that are eight. My number one complaint about
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.040]  almost every single series I watch these days is I get to
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.640]  the end of the eight eight series season and I think that
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.920]  could have been like four episodes like it just it would
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.720]  have been tighter and it just better at 422 was a lot and
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:10.760]  there were there were some some dead spots in the middle of
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:13.800]  that well and and and the the hard thing they had to work
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.800]  with too and and they they dropped a little bit of it, but
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:18.280]  they were trying to be topical and they were trying to infuse
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:21.880]  the parts of the show itself into it, which again with 22
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:24.760]  episodes like that's hard. 30 Rock had that same issue a
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.920]  little bit and they quickly dropped that where they were
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.800]  like we're just gonna be a cartoon, which was the perfect
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.640]  approach, but trying to kind of make it topical, but they'd
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.960]  come off of the the the people behind it, obviously Aaron
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.280]  Sorkin, but Thomas Schlamme. He did the West Wing and he's
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:42.200]  also on ER, which both of those were shows that did. I mean ER
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:46.360]  some some seasons had 26 episodes and and ER was a
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:50.200]  really insane show because the amount of like steady cam and
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.680]  other stuff like talk about fast paced show like I don't
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.400]  even know how they did that. I really don't but Studio 60. I
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.680]  think that I mean I it's one of those that's it's funny. I was
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:04.360]  talking about this on Twitter a couple of weeks ago with my
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:07.560]  friend Ben Dreyfus who is making some sort of comment
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.880]  about it and and II contend like II thought Matt Perry was
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.440]  great. I still think the problem with that show in
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:17.720]  addition to going up against 30 Rock and probably trying to do
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:20.520]  all that it did. I think if they'd made the emotional
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.760]  center, not Matthew Perry and Sarah Paulson, but if they'd
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.560]  focused on the the two stars who actually had chemistry,
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.600]  which were Bradley Whitford and Amanda Peet. I think it would
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.600]  have maybe been a little bit better, but I watched the pilot
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:37.960]  today in advance of this. Yeah, it holds up. It's one of those
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:40.200]  things that I mean way too many network references, which I
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:43.240]  remember at the time. I was like, yes, congratulations.
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:45.720]  You've seen network and and you and you've mentioned Patty
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:49.400]  Chayefsky 500 times and I was like in film school. So for me
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.800]  to I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it exactly
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.280]  exactly. It was very much reminiscent of that, but you
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.880]  know they had what's his face Judd Hirsch as as the mad as
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:01.400]  hell kind of thing, but I rewatched that pilot and it was
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:05.240]  good and Matthew Perry was very very good in it. Yeah and and
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:08.360]  that was a show that it's it's it's frustrating that it was
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:13.560]  shot on film. The the broadcast is is in letterbox, but it's
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:16.760]  only available in SD. Like yeah, it's very frustrating
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.720]  everywhere. Yeah, it's it's it's you can buy it on iTunes.
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:23.000]  You can buy it from Amazon, but it's only an SD and it I that's
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.680]  what's so it get you're exactly right. It's shot on film so
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:29.720]  they could remaster it if they had to. Oh yeah. It wouldn't
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.440]  even be hard like they have the master right there and let's
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:35.960]  just be that like you and I and a number of your readers who
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.960]  emailed you in about it like we're the only people who
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:40.440]  watched it. It's one of those shows. Actually, it's amazing
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:43.560]  that got 22 episodes because they've given it a full order
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:46.440]  from what I recall really early on, but the ratings were not
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:49.000]  there and I think it aired on Tuesdays. I want to say I don't
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.080]  remember what day it aired now. Maybe it was thirty. Maybe it
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.280]  was thirty was on Tuesdays, but they were on different nights
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:57.800]  and I watched it. I watched it the whole time like II watched
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:01.400]  the entire thing because I'm a huge Aaron Sorkin fan, but he
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.480]  was really good on that and and it was all the friends. Actors
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:10.280]  had a hard time transitioning into other TV roles after
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:14.920]  friends, but although II pointed this out to you in our
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:17.800]  text message earlier today, what's interesting to me when I
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.760]  think about 30 Rock, a 30 Rock Studio 60 is that the modern
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:27.880]  corollary for it is the morning show on Apple TV. Yeah. And and
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:30.760]  and this season, it's gone full soap, which I love. I love
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:32.840]  everything they've done with it. I'm like, yes, embrace the
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.480]  soap of it all, but it is one of those things where I was kind
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:37.000]  of thinking about it, especially after I watched the
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.080]  pilot. I was like, yeah, this is completely this was 1516
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.120]  years ahead of its time for what the the morning show and
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:47.960]  which also stars as friends star. Yeah, it's kind of trying to do
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:50.920]  comes full circle. I I have to say I never thought of that
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:53.320]  until you said it in our text message when we were setting up
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.160]  this broadcast, but I was like, Oh, as soon as you said it, I
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:57.400]  was like, Oh my God. Yeah. It feels like the same cinematic
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:01.080]  universe. It feels like it feels like they could mention Studio
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.600]  60. They could. Yeah. They're both the same network, right?
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:07.400]  Like it's like like they're they're both in it and both of
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:11.320]  them are it's funny are sort of being a riff on on NBC. I
[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.720]  always I always think and I've noticed this for a long time. I
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:16.920]  think people underestimate comedy in every regard. I think
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:20.040]  because they think comedy means jokes. Jokes aren't serious. So
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:23.400]  it's all just fluff and it's like all comedy is the
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:28.200]  equivalent of I don't know the Kathy comic strip or Garfield,
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:34.680]  right? It's not but I think comedy it is so difficult to do
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.800]  well and I think there are so many cases of actors and
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:45.320]  actresses who become known for a comedic role and then they do
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.840]  something dramatic and everybody's like, wow, this
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:53.240]  person who I only thought was an idiot clown who did jokes is
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:56.120]  actually a good actor. Robin Williams is a perfect example,
[02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:59.080]  right? Maybe the canonical example, but you know, like
[02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:03.080]  when Steve Martin does a serious role, he's he's so good
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.880]  and I thought Matthew Perry had that going and it to me, it's
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:10.440]  like comedy is so hard and timing is so essential, right?
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:14.680]  The exact same actor with the same camera angle and the same
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:18.280]  lighting and if you deliver the line with the wrong timing,
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:21.080]  it's not funny at all and if you deliver it with the perfect
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:25.080]  timing, it's hilarious and that timing even though it has
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:29.080]  nothing to do with jokes, you translate it to drama and it's
[02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:33.080]  it's like man that is acting and Matthew Perry had it and
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:36.600]  it's very sad and we definitely mentioned, you know, he
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.720]  obviously struggled with addiction to all sorts of
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:43.320]  stuff. His book was really good. Everything from booze to pills
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:47.240]  to everything in between. I didn't read anything about it,
[02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:51.000]  but I mean, I guess drowning in his pool probably was on
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.640]  something. I don't know. They don't know, but they think
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:56.440]  apparently he'd been playing pickleball and he came back and
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:59.720]  then he got in like the jacuzzi. So Coroner hasn't come
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.000]  back with a report yet, but it would make sense. They didn't
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.960]  find any like illicit substances there, but it would
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.280]  make sense that potentially because of other stuff you've
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.840]  done to his body and whatnot that he had a heart attack.
[02:07:10.840 --> 02:07:12.760]  That's what I'm saying. Yeah, maybe it's possible too, right?
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.920]  So even if he wasn't on something when he died, if he
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:18.120]  wasn't drunk or on pills or something, it's just the
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:21.400]  ravaging of his body. I mean, and to be to be honest, I mean,
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:23.400]  you could see it on his face. Yeah, you could. He looked
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:27.880]  older than 54. I mean, he did, but man, oh man, the guy was so
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:31.000]  generous. I did not read his book. Amy did. It's really good.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.720]  It's a really good book. The audible version, which he reads
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.680]  is also good and I encourage people to listen to that.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.040]  It's, I've upped it to near, I want to, now I want to read it.
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:45.960]  I'm sorry, Matthew Perry's memory that now I want to read
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:49.400]  your book because you died, but I just, I can't say enough
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.280]  good things about his, and so many people now that he's dead
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:56.280]  have said all these surprising stories about his remarkable
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:59.880]  generosity and he set up like he used his wealth to create
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:03.960]  like a halfway house for just complete strangers to help them
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.760]  get through their own struggles with whatever addictions they
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:11.000]  had. Just genuine heartfelt, nothing but trying to help other
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.200]  people with similar problems just seemed like, you can't
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.160]  find a single person saying anything other than that he was
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:22.760]  just a remarkably good, talented person who just struggled with
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:28.280]  this problem his whole life. It's a shame for sure. Anyway,
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.400]  glad to hear you, glad but also not surprised at all to hear
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:34.680]  you were a big fan. I was, yeah, I was a big, huge Studio
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:38.200]  60 fan and because I loved Aaron Sorkin. I mean, look,
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:41.320]  Sports Night was the better show, like that's, and of the
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:44.600]  two Keith Olbermann shows that Aaron Sorkin has just made,
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:46.840]  that's also the best one, although I didn't hate the
[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:50.760]  newsroom. A lot of people did, but I didn't. But I'd say I
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:54.440]  can watch it. I could watch Aaron Sorkin about watching
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.960]  paint dry on the wall. No, watch it. I just say, Ah, this is a
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.280]  crummy Aaron Sorkin show. When's the next episode? Right,
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:03.320]  exactly. Exactly. But no, but Studio 60. Like I said, I was
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:06.680]  really glad that I watched the pilot earlier today. And, and I
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.040]  was, it was nice to see him. It was also really weird to see
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.200]  some of the people who were in it, like most notably Sarah
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.280]  Paulson, who? Yeah, really? Yeah, who's like, like massive,
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.280]  massive new success now. But I think for a lot of people like
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:23.560]  that was, that was certainly my first exposure to her, I think.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:26.840]  But yeah, people, people who've been on, like Lucy Davis, who
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.360]  was on Studio 60, wrote like a really nice kind of remembrance
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:35.160]  of him on Instagram, which, and you shared some of the funny
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:38.040]  things that with me, I think, like him telling a story on
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:41.800]  Graham Norton, but he's just a really good actor, really funny.
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.840]  And somebody that I think, because he was our friend,
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:46.680]  right? Like, that's why I think this is weird. This is one of
[02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:50.840]  those weird moments, where it hits like every generation,
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.200]  but it's like, this felt like when Kobe died. This was like
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.000]  one of those moments for me, I was like that, like, I texted my
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.720]  friends the same way I did when when Kobe Bryant died, like it
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:02.600]  was the exact same sort of thing. And through those rare
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:04.920]  people that you don't know anything about them, other than
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.840]  their personal struggles and whatnot, and what you see on
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.600]  screen, but that are just, I don't know, they're, they're
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:15.400]  people that we all they were in our homes every day. Yeah. Well,
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:18.680]  thank you for joining me on short notice for a quick
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:22.840]  turnaround show. Always good to hear from you, Christina. What
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.280]  should we shout out? Where should we point to people online?
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.840]  So go to githubuniverse.com, because that's taking place
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:32.280]  next week. And I'm going to be one of the hosts of that event.
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.360]  And you can check that out. That's going to be on the eighth
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.720]  and the ninth next week. And actually, there is going to be
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:40.760]  some Mac stuff that we talk about that if people are
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.320]  interested in how we do things like doing our Mac OS hosted
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.360]  runners, there's a there's a little video that's going to
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:51.240]  happen on one of those days, I think on day two that features
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:54.600]  yours truly, and some very cool data center stuff with max
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:57.960]  that's, that's me giving just a little bit of a, of a teaser.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:03.880]  I am really glad I asked you. I will also thank our sponsors
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:09.000]  Squarespace are good friends and our new sponsor, nuts.com,
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  where you can get all sorts of good snack foods, thanks to
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.440]  them and break a leg next week. I look forward to seeing it.
