[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  You know, I can't believe I missed the holiday party again.
[00:03.000 --> 00:08.000]  There's a different kind of holiday party.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Anything interesting happen in the last few weeks?
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  No. It's quiet. Peaceful.
[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  I saw a tumbleweed roll by.
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  You know, not much.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  Apple doesn't really do much in the fall.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  Ah.
[00:24.000 --> 00:33.000]  You have to laugh a little.
[00:33.000 --> 00:43.000]  I was talking to my wife the other day about, we were on a walk, and I said, you know, I feel like it's been going nonstop for a long time, and then I realized it totally had been going nonstop for a long time.
[00:43.000 --> 00:58.000]  We went to Ireland for Ool, and I realized, like, literally, I went to the Apple event, and the next day I got on a plane and went to this event in Southern California, this festival over the weekend, and then from there I went basically straight to Ool.
[00:58.000 --> 01:11.000]  And in the middle there, like, I got the one review unit of the MacBook Pro, and then, like, the day after I came back from Ireland, I got the Touch Bar review unit of the MacBook Pro, and it is nonstop.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  It's just like one thing after another all fall.
[01:14.000 --> 01:30.000]  You know what I mean, and it's, you know, tough life for us, you know what I mean, reviewing amazing new computers before anybody gets them while jetting around the globe to meet interesting people, but it has been hectic.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not complaining.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  It is a privilege to do this, but this is the high season.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  I mean, that's the way I keep telling people it's high season.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  This is when everything is happening for Apple.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  It's like this time period and, like, WWDC are the two craziest times of the year.
[01:45.000 --> 02:04.000]  I think this is crazier, honestly, for us, because just, I don't know, somehow, to me, even that several weeks-long period between the iPhone 7 coming out and the MacBook event, I don't know, that somehow seemed jam-packed with stuff too.
[02:04.000 --> 02:13.000]  You know, rules in Apple Watch, you know, two rules in there, and, yeah, I mean, there's a lot going on, a lot of stuff going on.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  Anyway, long story short, it just wasn't a good time for an election that I had a, like, 110% obsessive interest in to roll through.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  So, yeah, there's stuff, lots of stuff going on.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  It was a busy fall.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  I do feel like we've reached, you know, it's all subsiding a little bit now, and I feel like mentally I'm starting to shift gears.
[02:34.000 --> 02:49.000]  I've still got some stuff that I put off that I need to pick back up again, but it's like mentally shifting gears into, you know, holidays, end of year, people, you know, if you want to make holiday stories and gift guides and best of the year lists and stuff like that.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's starting to feel more like that at last, which is good because, like, Thanksgiving's next week, so, I mean, here it is.
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  I thought it was a little, the MacBook Pro review, I got all, I got three of them.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  I got the button one, what are they called?
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  We're calling it the MacBook Escape.
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.000]  I guess we are.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  Makes me think of the Journey album, but, you know, whatever.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  I know I got that the same time you did.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  We got that the day of the event.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Yeah, they had those.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  I got the 13-inch with the touch bar, I don't know, a week later, about at least a week later.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  I don't know if it was six days or eight days.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  It was the week I was in Ireland, which was the week after the event, because I got an email from Apple on, like, a Wednesday in Ireland saying,
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  can you come buy Cupertino on Thursday to pick up your 13-inch MacBook with touch bar?
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  And I was like, uh, no.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  And so I didn't get that one.
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  And then I got the 15-inch, I don't know, but that was late.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  The 15-inch was really only just a few days before the embargo deadline.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  So I opened it and I turned it on and looked at it, but I spent much less time with the 15-inch,
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  simply because I already had the 13-inch with the touch bar set up with my stuff.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  You know, it's like, I've got BB Edit on it and, you know, it's just there.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  And the little, you know, the thing I do to wrap block quotes so they all look like nice markdown block quotes that's already there.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.000]  And again, not that we're complaining about getting review units, but, you know, onboarding to a new Mac is a lot of work.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  And when you have to do it three times in three weeks, it's like, oh, here we go again.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  Like, what files? What do I install? Can I migrate? No, I don't really want to migrate, but then I have to install everything.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  I have to, you know, hook it up with Dropbox.
[04:30.000 --> 04:41.000]  And I don't know about you, I also have to juggle, like, there are these hard breaks of, like, five authorized iTunes computers and, like, ten authorized Apple Music devices.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  And so I'm always juggling, like, logging out of different iPads and phones and stuff in order to get slots back to put other computers in there.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  And it's, yeah, so it's, again, not complaining. It's great that we get to do this for our job.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  But, you know, like, all of this stuff is not meant to be done as frequently as we do them.
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.000]  So, yeah.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  I mean, even little things. I've run into a little thing where my Amex card has a maximum limit on how many Apple Pay devices it can be hooked up to.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[05:13.000 --> 05:25.000]  And, you know, it's magnified because it's, like, now you get two phones, when they give you review phones, they give you one of each size, and it's, like, I got iPads and stuff, and it's, like, I don't even know, you know.
[05:25.000 --> 05:30.000]  And some of them I've foolishly left named John's iPad.
[05:30.000 --> 05:37.000]  So it's, like, right? It's, like, what? Which one is it? I don't know.
[05:37.000 --> 05:44.000]  And occasionally there are, like, updates that reset the name. So I realized the other day that my iPad is called iPad again, and it's, like, well, I don't know when that happened.
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  But it's, like, no wonder I went on my device list and I saw three things named iPad and had no idea which was which.
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  It's, yeah, it's, I haven't been able to do Apple Pay. I've been testing the Apple Watch, too, and I actually haven't written about that yet.
[05:58.000 --> 06:06.000]  But it can't do Apple Pay because it's just, I think my financial institutions have given up on me, and they're, like, no, no more devices for you.
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  Every time I try to pair it, it's just, like, I can't even forget it, you know.
[06:10.000 --> 06:19.000]  Oh, and my bank, sometimes what I've done is I generally, if I use a charge card, I use my Amex, I just use it everywhere.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  And the only times I ever don't use it is if I'm in a place that doesn't take Amex.
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.000]  But to get around this Amex limit, if I have a device that I'm testing from Apple that I don't really want to spend, I know I'm not going to spend a ton of time on.
[06:34.000 --> 06:47.000]  You know, like, for example, at WWDC, they gave me an Apple Watch with the beta of watchOS 3, which, like, I think that's when they gave it to me.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  I don't know, but at some point they gave it to me. It wasn't new hardware. It was just, you know, here, you could try this thing out with the watchOS 3.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  And I thought, well, that's interesting, but it's like, I'll just put the watchOS 3 beta on my own Apple Watch, you know what I mean?
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  And so I didn't, you know, I didn't want to put this Amex limit on it, so I used my other card.
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  My bank sends me a letter in the mail every time I set up Apple Pay that it's like, congratulations.
[07:09.000 --> 07:17.000]  It's so totally written from the perspective of, like, you're going to have one device, you know, that you do this with, and we'll tell you everything, how it works, and, you know.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  And I just keep, it's like, I should have kept all the letters, because I'll bet I've got 15 of them by now.
[07:23.000 --> 07:32.000]  Well, I think the advantage of this is it's so easy in so many different ways that you do, you review tech products, to lose perspective if you're not careful.
[07:32.000 --> 07:48.000]  And this is like the reverse of that, which is there's nobody, I think, more aware of the pain of basically upgrading to a new device than reviewers, because we have to do it, like, with every device.
[07:48.000 --> 08:00.000]  Like, for a while there, I could tell you everything you need to do to migrate from a MacBook to another MacBook, or from a PowerBook to another PowerBook, because I was reviewing all the laptops at Macworld.
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.000]  And so, like, I would go through, I would migrate everything a couple times a year.
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  And so, I mean, that's good, because we get to experience that, and I think Apple's got some issues with the migration assistant on the Mac, and with some of the stuff, they're getting better.
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.000]  But, like, you know, they've got some issues there, and those really come out when you're migrating multiple times a year.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  Because regular people only might do it once a year for a phone, and once every several years for an iPad or a Mac.
[08:26.000 --> 08:38.000]  I have spoken, I still think it's too hard on a Mac. And I think part of it is because I don't, I think part of it really is a technical challenge, and not just a disinterest.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  I think because you can, you still have so much freedom of what to put where in a file system on a Mac.
[08:46.000 --> 08:57.000]  And it's, you know, really, it's just technically not, it's not, you can't just say clone the disk and open it, you know, it's because there's all sorts of stuff that's different because it's different hardware.
[08:57.000 --> 09:10.000]  You know, I think it's the number one motivator why they do, why they did desktop and documents syncing the way they did it, was that that was sort of like their, if you keep everything, if you buy everything through the App Store, which, you know, some people do,
[09:10.000 --> 09:21.000]  and you're not a superpower user, but you keep everything in documents and on the desktop, and then you log into a new Mac, like it'll just sync your stuff and you're ready to go.
[09:21.000 --> 09:28.000]  It's for the rest of us who've got, you know, legacy apps, non-Mac App Store apps, all sorts of stuff like that.
[09:28.000 --> 09:39.000]  And then you turn to Migration Assistant, and I'm not convinced Migration Assistant is doing so hot. I've tried it twice with these two MacBook Pros that I've got, and it failed both times.
[09:39.000 --> 09:48.000]  Well, it's interesting. I've given up on Migration Assistant, to be honest. I haven't used it in a few years. I mean, and maybe I should, you know, give it another shot, one of these, although what you just said.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  I don't think you should. I don't recommend it.
[09:52.000 --> 10:07.000]  What I have is an Apple Notes document. I started this two or three years ago, setting up a new Mac. And so it's, the first thing I do is I, you know, go through the first run, I put my iCloud, you know, go through and put my iCloud credentials in.
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  So because I put my iCloud credentials in, my note syncs. And then the note has a checklist of, you know, do this, do this, do this.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  It's, you know, and that's like an onboarding script for yourself.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Yeah, more or less. And then some of the stuff I'll just skip.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  Like a pre-flight checklist, right? Like do this, then do this, then do this. All right, got it. So you don't miss a step.
[10:27.000 --> 10:41.000]  You know, it kills me. BBEdit will sync all of its, let's nerd out for you. It's you and me. We talked about baseball, we'll talk about BBEdit. BBEdit will let you put like all of its support stuff in Dropbox, which is great.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  And I use that, but it's preferences file does not go in Dropbox.
[10:46.000 --> 11:05.000]  And so every time I move to a new Mac, I either have to manually reset all of the preferences or I have to go to, you know, a home folder, library application support, no library preferences, com.barebones, you know, BBEdit preferences and copy that file over so that my editor is the way I like it.
[11:05.000 --> 11:15.000]  And I do that every single time I move Macs. That's like one of those things on the checklist is I got to move my BBEdit preferences because they don't cloud sync. I can't fish them out of Dropbox.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  Yeah, I've been meaning for I've used that ever since BBEdit added that feature. I mean, it's a couple years ago, at least.
[11:21.000 --> 11:36.000]  And at first I really liked it, but it's grown to annoy me because I end up with like the same documents open because I also have the preference set to restore open documents and they're all almost all almost everything I write in BBEdit is stored in Dropbox.
[11:36.000 --> 11:50.000]  So when I go to a different machine and use BBEdit there, Dropbox has the same document. And so it's open to and I don't I have found that I don't want that because I found that too.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  I leave too many documents open.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  Yeah. And and oftentimes I, you know, I'll leave one place and finish in the other. And then I go back and it's like, oh, I don't want that.
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.000]  You know, it's opening documents that I'm done with because it lost state because I'm not, you know, keeping them open and in sync myself. And and that day, I agree.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  I've noticed that. But I like the fact that like all my scripts and clippings and things like that are just sort of there everywhere.
[12:12.000 --> 12:25.000]  That's nice. I do, too. But I and I know it's going to annoy me to go back to the old way where if I write a new script or just one of my scripts, just tweak one of my scripts that to get that that script to percolate everywhere.
[12:25.000 --> 12:37.000]  I'd have to do it manually, you know, zip up the I don't know. Maybe what I should do is just turn off the preference to reopen documents and see. I don't know.
[12:37.000 --> 12:45.000]  But it's a mild annoyance that I've had. I've been thinking for like a year. I should like dig into this and redo it. But I don't.
[12:45.000 --> 12:55.000]  I know there's so many things that we do with our computers that are like it's annoying, but it doesn't. You've got to you got to clear the bar of I'm going to sit down for an hour and figure out what the hell is going on.
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.000]  And so you're just like, man, I'm not going to leave it. And probably do we do you have more than an hour of misery? Maybe, maybe not. But it's just enough.
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  I do that all the time with like automation stuff where automation is great, but it's got to you got to clear the time to like do it.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  And then once you do it, you're like, yeah, I've got this automation thing. But so often it's just like, yeah, I'm not going to bother.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  It's close enough and it's not enough annoyance for me to break out an hour to try and figure it out. So you just leave it.
[13:23.000 --> 13:35.000]  I actually, you know, it's funny to say that I actually did a couple of those things last week as a sort of get my mind off of other things, you know, get my mind off the Internet.
[13:35.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I found it very difficult to to write, honestly. I'll tell you what, I read a thing.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  You know, let's just keep going meta here. And I know Merlin and I talked about this last week extensively, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  The election and hard feelings. But I saw a couple of other people with sight. Stephen Levy had a good thing on his back channel.
[13:59.000 --> 14:10.000]  He was just a day after the election. But I have a half of me says I should just charge ahead and write some, you know, typically daring fireball topic stuff.
[14:10.000 --> 14:25.000]  Because other people who read during fireball, I'm sure would more than even usual love to have their mind occupied by this, you know, to get it off thoughts of the election and President Trump.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  But then there's another half of me that says that is it's it's so it's inappropriate, right?
[14:33.000 --> 14:45.000]  That something this, you know, seismic level happens. It's just it's just foolish to write something that is so off topic.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  And so I found myself unusually jammed last week in terms of actually getting anything written.
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  So what I did is I occupied myself by doing a couple like AppleScript things that I'd been meaning to write for myself.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  And it really it helped. I this is sort of thing where I once I start like writing an AppleScript.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  And I mean, because half of it would for me always with AppleScript is what the hell is the syntax for black?
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  I find myself like an hour can go by and I haven't had any thoughts of the election.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I'm and it's like the best hour of my day was writing. What is it here? I've got it.
[15:22.000 --> 15:29.000]  Just opened it. It's a AppleScript that creates a new text file at the current right in the current finder window.
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  That's nice. I mean, I've it's funny that we're talking about this because as we record this,
[15:36.000 --> 15:47.000]  I think that the news kind of broke today that Sal Segoian, who is the automation and AppleScript product manager at Apple for years, is no longer employed by Apple.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  I did not know that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That just he just mentioned that he did.
[15:51.000 --> 16:01.000]  He did a presentation at the Mac Tech conference today. And and I'm not I have to say I'm sad, but I'm not really surprised because I'm not sure Apple's eye has been on that particular ball for a long time.
[16:01.000 --> 16:09.000]  But, you know, and it's not for everybody. And when I talk, people know that I do automation stuff and they're like, oh, you know, it's hard to get into.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  And and that's all true. But then, you know, every and again, I do leave things for a long time.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  And sometimes it's like, oh, well, you know, I should automate that. But every time I do one of those, I finally put in that work.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  Not only is it kind of a pleasure to solve the problem, I and I think to myself, this must be what computer programmers feel all the time.
[16:27.000 --> 16:34.000]  But, you know, once it's done, I can hand it to other people sometimes if they want it. I've done that a little bit.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  And, you know, things get passed around and it can make it just can make your life better.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  Like I have a bunch of things now that are they're not even Apple scripts.
[16:43.000 --> 16:49.000]  They're they're shell scripts that run inside a service.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  So basically, you know, you basically make an automator thing that says do the shell scripts.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  Yeah. And and then you wire that to the current selection as input and pass it to the script.
[16:59.000 --> 17:15.000]  Yeah. And so I do that for like I've got I've got all these scripts that either I'm I'm, you know, clicking on something in the finder and doing a keyboard shortcut or I'm I'm choosing it from the contextual menu to do all sorts of like audio processing and stuff for podcasts.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  And I just do it in in it's it's all scripts running in the background.
[17:18.000 --> 17:24.000]  And I got a lot of these scripts from Marco Arment, who is very comfortable with the command line and just issues all these things from the command line.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  I'm like, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to put it in a little, you know, I'm going to wrap it in an automator and just hit a keyboard shortcut and do it.
[17:30.000 --> 17:43.000]  And it's great. And every time I do one of those things, I think to myself, I can't believe I went months where I was bringing up the terminal and dragging in folders to get the path names and then issuing the the shell scripting commands and all of that.
[17:43.000 --> 17:51.000]  And now all I do is point and click. I mean, that's the that's the great thing about Mac automation stuff. And iOS, too, really is once once it's done, you know, it's out of the way.
[17:51.000 --> 18:01.000]  All you do is go boop and magic things happen. And, you know, that's that's that's that's the abstracted computer user interface in a nutshell right there is you shouldn't know what the steps are.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  You should be able to build the steps and then put it aside and just keep doing your work.
[18:05.000 --> 18:13.000]  And some of the utilities, you know, that are along those lines, like text expander and keyboard maestro, I think you might start does this.
[18:13.000 --> 18:21.000]  I'm almost certain text expander does is there's a way if you go to like the about box or something, it shows you how much time you've saved since you've been using it.
[18:21.000 --> 18:31.000]  And if you've been using I've got some of these utilities where I somehow it's like I look and it tells me I've saved, you know, like 10 hours of time over so many years.
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.000]  But that's like at each little step. I get one of them for me. I've published this somewhere. I don't know.
[18:37.000 --> 18:45.000]  It's I think it's a gist or something like that. I've written about on during Fireball, but I have a very particular style of title casing I use on during Fireball.
[18:45.000 --> 18:59.000]  Where there's it's, you know, every, you know, big word gets an uppercase letter and then there's a specific set of little words that are not like of a and.
[18:59.000 --> 19:08.000]  And it can be tricky, though, to do it to to automate it, because you can be fooled by things like.
[19:08.000 --> 19:16.000]  Quotes in the text that's being selected, because then the should be capitalized if it's the first word in the quote, because it's like the title of the thing.
[19:16.000 --> 19:30.000]  So I've packed together a script years ago that gets it right. Ninety nine point nine percent of the time. And I have it exactly like, you know, like you said, it's an automator script or service with that shell script running in it.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  And I have it mapped to shift shift command T for title case.
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  And there are some I think about how much time that has saved me over the years.
[19:39.000 --> 19:49.000]  And it's it's just unbelievable. And but before I wrote it, even though I've been using it for years, I think, well, all those years I was like arrow, arrow, arrow shift, you know, retype the letter, arrow, arrow.
[19:49.000 --> 19:57.000]  It's crazy. Yeah, it's it's well, I mean, that's a keyboard. Meister tells me I've saved seven hours, by the way. I just looked.
[19:57.000 --> 20:06.000]  It goes back to regular expressions, right? I mean, you did you write the chapter in the BB edit manual about regular expressions? Was that you know?
[20:06.000 --> 20:17.000]  No, but the second half of it is. So I think this is fair to say I don't want to take too much credit. The regular expression chapter in BB edit was there when I started.
[20:17.000 --> 20:27.000]  But BB edit was using a very old regular expression library. It was really a derivative of the like the original Unix one.
[20:27.000 --> 20:38.000]  A guy named Henry, somebody, somebody wrote it and it only had like the basic regular expression syntax. It was almost more like a glorified wildcards.
[20:38.000 --> 20:47.000]  Yeah. And all the fancy stuff that you can do when you read that chapter and you're like, holy crap, was added when I was there.
[20:47.000 --> 20:59.000]  And so I wrote the, you know, the added onto the chapter to write all the PCRE stuff. All right. Yeah, that's anyway, that's I tell people about grep, about regular expressions.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  And they have that same look as when I talk about Automator or if you talk about shell scripting, which is like, I don't want to learn it.
[21:04.000 --> 21:14.000]  I don't understand it. I don't know. And like I get I get that. But like, especially when I when I would talk to writers and editors about grep, I'd be like, you don't understand.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  Text is what you do for a living. I am telling you, if you like, buy Jeff Friedl's book, you know, or read the BB edit chapter.
[21:23.000 --> 21:30.000]  There are things in there that, you know, you if you learn it, all of a sudden you'll be sitting there thinking, oh, man, I can't believe I need to do this.
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  This is going to take me an hour. And if you know the language of grep, if you know those symbols, you can do it in two minutes.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  And it only needs to happen once. And you realize that it is, you know, it is a life skill that you need to have.
[21:46.000 --> 21:54.000]  I'll tell you the truth. There's a true story. I didn't learn regular expressions while I was in college, even though I was a BB edit nerd, comp sci major.
[21:54.000 --> 22:04.000]  I just look I mean, I think the furthest I ever got was like dot plus and dot star, which is, you know, just more like like old dots wildcards.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  Find everything. And I just never saw the need for it.
[22:09.000 --> 22:24.000]  And like a year or so after college, I got a temp job at the Philadelphia Inquirer in the advertising department where they had a bunch of Excel spreadsheets with all of the ad rates for everything.
[22:24.000 --> 22:36.000]  And it was each department had their own thing. And each one had like seven pages or 12 pages of ads in a, you know.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  A matrix, you know, so keeping them in Excel as where the business people set them made total sense.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  And then, you know, there would be graphic designers who turn them into a book that they could send out to people.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  So I got hired to do these books because I could do graphic design. And so I did the first one.
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  And this is how everybody did it. But there was all sorts of gibberish in columns that wasn't public.
[22:58.000 --> 23:05.000]  You know, and it was it must have made sense for the business people who'd use the Excel spreadsheet, but it didn't need to go in there.
[23:05.000 --> 23:12.000]  And so the way that every you know, it was done before and the way I did the first book was I just went in and edited each column by hand.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  And it was just, you know, tab, delete, tab, delete and just pages and pages and pages and pages.
[23:18.000 --> 23:26.000]  And, you know, a couple of days work easily or maybe a week's work for the whole book, mostly just deleting crap.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  And I thought there's got to be a better way. And I thought about that.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  I think this is the sort of stuff regular expressions are supposed to solve.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  And so I wrote I just spent like a day writing like just a couple of regular expressions and BB edit.
[23:38.000 --> 23:48.000]  And then so I went from Excel to text BB edit to just run a couple of saved grip patterns, import it into the document.
[23:48.000 --> 23:57.000]  And I was done. And I mean, it literally turned like a week's work of work for each book into about like two hours.
[23:57.000 --> 24:06.000]  And so I just but I acted as though I didn't write the script and just sat there, you know, browse the web.
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.000]  It's that's actually going out of Excel is that's like a pro tip for for all this stuff, too.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's like I can't tell you how many times I've had something in Excel that's been a disaster.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  And I just select it and paste it into BB edit. It comes in as tab delimited and or you save it out as a tab delimited file.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  And you do all of the crazy text stuff and you just make sure that there are tabs between the fields and you bring it back into Excel.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  And you're like, look, it was it was it was in Excel all along, but it wasn't.
[24:32.000 --> 24:42.000]  You know, you completely take it out in times where I've taken multiple columns in Excel and I pulled them out and then kind of like mix them and match them and reassembled them in the right way.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  And then you paste them back in. And it's like, you know, it's like they never left Excel, but they totally came out of Excel.
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.000]  And it's not like you can't do some wildcard stuff in Excel, but and you probably can write visual basic scripts that do things, too.
[24:54.000 --> 25:02.000]  But for me, it was just like, can I get this back to text and can I can I write a couple of pattern matching search and replaces that solve this problem?
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  And usually the answer is, yeah, and you can take an hour of work and do it in 10 minutes.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  Five minutes. I mean, it literally turns off the Web, literally turn weeks, weeks of work into hours of work.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  And I just got paid for weeks of work. I felt like I deserved it.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  Yeah, I will just say this one last thing. It was a long time ago. It must have been 2001 or so when I wrote that.
[25:25.000 --> 25:40.000]  The second half of the BB Edit chapter, I would still say is one of the pieces of writing that I am most proud of in my entire life, because people have told me many times when they find out that I wrote it, they're like, oh, my God, that was the first time regular expressions ever made sense to me.
[25:40.000 --> 25:49.000]  And I can't take credit for the whole chapter. But I did take a pass through the early part just because that was my goal is I do feel like I have a knack for regular expressions.
[25:49.000 --> 26:01.000]  It's the one area of programming where I'm better than almost anybody. I really am good at figuring out how to create the syntax to match what I want to match.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  And it ends up creating these things that most people look at and they're like, what the hell?
[26:06.000 --> 26:14.000]  Yeah, I think that's the big problem with regular expressions is readability. Like, people see them and they think, it's nonsense, I can't do it.
[26:14.000 --> 26:22.000]  And it's like, no, no, no, if you learn it, it's actually fairly straightforward, not all of them, but most of them, but they look like nonsense.
[26:22.000 --> 26:30.000]  Well, I just thought, you know, but this is something, this is like a perfect combination for me because I have a knack for explaining things and I have a knack for regular expressions.
[26:30.000 --> 26:39.000]  And in hindsight, I still feel, you know, what is it, 14, 15 years later, I still feel it's one of the best things I've ever written.
[26:39.000 --> 26:52.000]  Yeah, I love that chapter. I mentioned Jeff Friedl's O'Reilly book about this. It's great, but it's from the possession of a, you know, long-time Unix guy and he talks about scripting a lot in that, like, shell and Perl scripting.
[26:52.000 --> 27:05.000]  And for me, the most direct application was BB edit. So, the BB edit chapter is a much more distilled, clear approach to this than, I love that Friedl book and I use, I reference it all the time,
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  but the BB edit chapter is just a much more simple, gentle introduction.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  Yeah, I love it. I love the Friedl book too. And I've read both editions, maybe three editions. I think there might be a third. I don't know. Every time there's a new edition, I buy it.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  There is a third.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  And I have all three copies and I've read them all cover to cover.
[27:23.000 --> 27:41.000]  It is, but it's, I would definitely say it is, this Friedl book is so comprehensive and so well done that it's, I don't know that I've ever read any book on any subject where you could say, well, there's no need for anybody else to ever write a book on this again.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  But I would honestly say that that's the case with Friedl's book on regular expressions.
[27:45.000 --> 28:00.000]  I just can't see how anybody else would say, well, I'll take the time to write a technical book, which is really hard on this subject when there's a book that covers it both perfectly and extensively.
[28:00.000 --> 28:21.000]  All right, maybe I'll take a break. How about I take a break here and thank the first friend of the show. It's our good friends, good friends at Casper. Casper, they make obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices. Go to casper.com slash the talk show and use code the talk show and you'll save 50 bucks towards your mattress with one exception.
[28:21.000 --> 28:40.000]  Hold on. I'll tell you what that is. Um, so here's the deal. I've told you this before. I'll say it again. Casper has created one perfect type of mattress. It's, it's a combination of like memory foam and um, you know, some other stuff that's just the right blend of types of things.
[28:40.000 --> 28:57.000]  So you don't have to pick between six different types of mattresses. How do you know what the difference is? These guys, it really is sort of like the apple attitude taken to mattresses. Trust us. We'll do all the work. We'll make one type of mattress and then all you have to do is pick the size. That's it.
[28:57.000 --> 29:12.000]  That is, it's just sings to me, this is how a mattress company should do it. Now, in addition to that, because they sell, they make them, they right here in the United States in fact, and they sell them directly to you. You just go there.
[29:12.000 --> 29:37.000]  Uh, they cut out the middleman and it enables them to keep their prices incredibly lower than the mainstream big brand mattresses you find in traditional mattress stores. Uh, premium mattresses often start at well over 1500 Casper mattresses costs just 500 for twin, 750 for full, 850 for queen and just 950 for a king.
[29:37.000 --> 29:55.000]  So you can get a king from them for less than like a twin from a lot of the other big brands. Crazy. Uh, and like I said, they're made right here in America. Now, biggest thing you think, how am I going to buy a thousand dollar mattress and not even try it?
[29:55.000 --> 30:08.000]  You don't have to worry about it. They have a hundred night home trial. If you don't love it, they will pick it up at your house, give you a full refund, no hard sell. It's not like trying to cancel your cable. It's something like that. You just say, I want to send it back.
[30:08.000 --> 30:16.000]  And they say, okay, when, you know, and then somebody shows up and they take the mattress away and you get your money back and that's it. I've had readers. Casper has been a sponsor long enough.
[30:16.000 --> 30:29.000]  I've gotten emails from readers who've done that and they said, I couldn't believe how, you know, couldn't believe how easy it was to actually just send it back because they actually, you know, they didn't believe that it was going to be easy because that just sounds too good to be true.
[30:29.000 --> 30:34.000]  But that's how confident Casper is in their mattress.
[30:34.000 --> 30:48.000]  Get yours today, a hundred nights in your own home. Uh, they have a dog mattress even that's a new product and that's the one that you don't get 50 bucks on cause it's a lower price. But if you have a, if you have a dog, get them a good mattress, go check it out.
[30:48.000 --> 31:02.000]  I've had readers tell me, this is the thing. When I first did this read, I didn't know that the, that the discount didn't apply to the dog one. So I had a couple of readers who said, Hey, I bought my dog the mattress, but I didn't get 50 bucks off, but I don't care because my dog loves the mattress.
[31:02.000 --> 31:15.000]  So that's, that's the exception. Go to casper.com slash the talk show and remember that code, the talk show to say 50 bucks on any, uh, human size mattress.
[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  Maybe that would get my dog off my couch.
[31:19.000 --> 31:27.000]  I love doing sponsor reads. I've gone from having it be the part of this job that I hate to a part that I love.
[31:27.000 --> 31:43.000]  I think that makes the, uh, not to get podcasty, uh, inside baseball, but I think that's make makes the reads better once when you can't, I, there are a couple of podcasts I listened to where, um, you know, the ads are, are part of the entertainment and you just can't, you know, you can't not listen to them.
[31:43.000 --> 31:52.000]  You can't tune out, you can't skip, you really got to pay attention cause they, they, uh, they put their personality into them and you know, and that I think that makes the difference.
[31:52.000 --> 31:59.000]  If it's, if it's like a hostage video or something, it's a lot less entertaining, but if it's a, if it's part of the fun, then it's a lot better.
[31:59.000 --> 32:06.000]  I can't even tell you how many emails I got from people about last week's show with Merlin were there a just thanking us like, Oh my God, I needed that.
[32:06.000 --> 32:12.000]  You know, um, you know, for the election week and they were like, Oh my God, this sponsor reads so good.
[32:12.000 --> 32:29.000]  Uh, I will just take a meta break here and just say, I don't have time to respond to all of my email, but I got so much email, never the most email I've gotten about an episode of the show in as long as I can remember from people last week and all of it.
[32:29.000 --> 32:42.000]  I honestly didn't see one that was, I honestly thought there'd be some from Trump people or, or, you know, people who just don't want to hear about people who are upset about the way the election turned out, you know, go back to tech dummy.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  I didn't get any of that and which was sort of our goal.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  That was the way, you know, that we approached it and what we talked about.
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  Um, but I got so much email from people thanking us for that.
[32:52.000 --> 32:58.000]  So I just want to say to all of you who listen, thank you for listening and thank you for the good words.
[32:58.000 --> 33:01.000]  I have a podcast question for you, Jason.
[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  You don't, I mean, do you do any other podcasts regularly?
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  Uh, occasionally.
[33:07.000 --> 33:10.000]  So you occasionally podcasts.
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.000]  Yeah.
[33:11.000 --> 33:19.000]  Yeah. Just from time to from time. You mean like per day?
[33:19.000 --> 33:39.000]  I got a bug up my butt recently about something that I had never thought about before and I, this is the sort of thing that I tend to think about and I can't believe I didn't really think that much about it when I set up the talk show to be on daring fireball, which is the fact that I've been doing it.
[33:39.000 --> 33:56.000]  I've always done it and it, most of the podcasts, almost all the podcasts I see do it, but putting the episode number in the title and making the episode number a major part, you know, like the, the main anchor on the URL that the, like on, on, on our websites on six colors.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  And during fireball, we don't have post number, you know, four 23,123.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.000]  Right.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  Oh, that was a good one.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  Good old, good old 23,323.
[34:08.000 --> 34:24.000]  Why, why do we do this? And, and, you know, uh, TV shows don't do it. I mean, they sort of do now like where you're like, when you watch digitally, you do, you know, you're going through season one, episode seven of American horror story or, or whatever.
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  So there is, there's sort of that on TV, but I don't know.
[34:30.000 --> 34:46.000]  I, I, it's a good, it's a good question. Like why, why do we number podcasts and you, you, I can always tell what number it is. Cause you actually do number them in the, like the slug of, of, uh, the talk show, but not like in the, in what people see, just like the written descriptions.
[34:46.000 --> 34:47.000]  Right.
[34:47.000 --> 35:09.000]  Well, but I have them in the metadata for the show. So like when you're looking at it in your podcast player, it will say 173 173. Yeah. Well, I switched recently. I did switch just a couple of weeks ago from putting EP period space, the digital, you know, representation of the number colon.
[35:09.000 --> 35:29.000]  I took out the EP cause I thought, you know what, it it's cruft like that, that I, I don't like, I like clean URLs. I don't like seeing dot PHP at the end of a URL. I don't like seeing all the gibberish and like the medium URLs. I don't like tracking any URL.
[35:29.000 --> 35:44.000]  I like the URL to have every single bit of it be meaningful. Uh, and I same way with like the titles. I don't, but it seems to me, I don't know. There seemed it. Part of me thinks that part of it is that you want to know which one's the newest episode in your podcast player.
[35:44.000 --> 35:58.000]  And that maybe it actually is useful because you it's, it's a more confident way of making sure that your podcast player, whatever software it is, whichever sort order it's using top to bottom or bottom to top, you know, which one's the newest one.
[35:58.000 --> 36:11.000]  So I'm keeping it. I like when I made the change to get rid of the EP period, I was on the verge of just getting rid of them period and maybe just putting them into URL. But then I thought, you know what, I think there's a reason everybody does it.
[36:11.000 --> 36:32.000]  I don't know if it's a reason that is, I don't know if it's a good reason or if it's more just sort of continuity. I mean, some of it is reference wise to be able to say it's this one, like saying like, um, like a Mac world, we had volumes and numbers like internally.
[36:32.000 --> 36:49.000]  We would have like, you turn in a story and it would be 24-04 and that was literally 24-04 was like the two, the April, 2008 issue or something. It was like volume 24 number four.
[36:49.000 --> 37:00.000]  And, and that was partially because in a file, in the file system, like it would sort, right. That all the 24-04s would go together and then there you'd have 24-05 and it would just kind of keep going like that.
[37:00.000 --> 37:12.000]  So I think some of it is just sort of like finding an internal structure and for podcasts, you could do it by date. You could literally say, you know, this is the one for the, you know, this day in November of 2016.
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  And the metadata certainly supplies that. So you could just, you could just do that. You could have nothing.
[37:18.000 --> 37:36.000]  Um, I don't know, as a kid growing up, I really loved reading comic books and the comic books always had that like, this is Amazing Spider-Man number 183 and, and they would have footnotes and they would say, oh, Spider-Man faced the scorpion before in Amazing Spider-Man number 83 and sent him to prison.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  And you'd be like, oh, number 83. Yes. If only I had that issue, I could read that now.
[37:40.000 --> 37:55.000]  And I, I, part of what appeals to me about the podcast numbering scheme is that, which is just, it lets you hang a number on it and say, for reference sake, this is what it is rather than saying season one, number three, um, or just giving you a date.
[37:55.000 --> 38:06.000]  Um, but I don't know if that's a great reason to do it. Um, probably also, uh, the, the other thought I had is since The Incomparable is now at 326 episodes.
[38:06.000 --> 38:15.000]  Um, I think maybe it was a, it made sense when you did 10 episodes of a podcast in the early days of podcasting.
[38:15.000 --> 38:27.000]  And now there are these podcasts that have hundreds and hundreds of episodes. We're pretty soon, if not already, there will very soon be many podcasts with, with, um, a thousand plus episodes.
[38:27.000 --> 38:39.000]  It's sort of crazy. Marco was saying on ATP, a couple, an episode or two ago, um, cause he knows because he runs the radio ones. Yeah. He said that the radio they're already there.
[38:39.000 --> 38:53.000]  Yeah. And they do. Cause there's radio stations that will publish five or six podcasts a day. Like it meaning like the 15 hour one hour, two hour, three hour, four of the, you know, the sports bands podcast in the morning.
[38:53.000 --> 39:07.000]  And so you'll have episode 1500. It's crazy. The comic book analogy is pretty good. Um, yeah, that's the best for me is it gives you something to hang it on sequentially and say, look, we've done a lot of these.
[39:07.000 --> 39:22.000]  And, and then, um, I have that with Incomparable. I mean, even though we built an index, one of the reasons that we did end up using use movable type, which you use on Daring Fireball for the, um, Incomparable CMS is because I wanted a, I wanted an index of,
[39:22.000 --> 39:34.000]  of topics. And so I've got an index of topics. So if somebody wants to see what's that episode where, where John Gruber and John Syracuse had talked about the Godfather, you can look up the Godfather and it'll be like, it's this number, right?
[39:34.000 --> 39:49.000]  But still people will email me, tweet me, post on Facebook, whatever they'll say, when was that episode about whatever. And it, there is something nice about being able to say that was number 32 and just kind of point them and be like, it's that one, that number.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  I don't know. It's like a little handle for an episode.
[39:52.000 --> 40:02.000]  Yeah. The alternative would be to just look at the dates and somehow, but that doesn't show up. That's not going to show up in the list in your podcast player.
[40:02.000 --> 40:19.000]  Well, but that's maybe a self-fulfilling prophecy, right? I mean, I think maybe podcast player UI is, is in part based on the idea that a lot of podcasts organize themselves by numbers, but like Overcast has a date field and there are dates for every episode in Overcast.
[40:19.000 --> 40:27.000]  And I would imagine most podcast players are kind of like that. And certainly if, if podcasts weren't numbered, I'm sure they would all be like that.
[40:27.000 --> 40:41.000]  Yeah. But if you, if I'd like made mine not numbered, uh, or didn't put the numbers into titles, it's not going to change it. You know what I mean? It's the collective decision that the podcast industry as a whole has made to do that.
[40:41.000 --> 40:54.000]  Yeah. It's more fun for me to say, we talked about Raiders of the Lost Ark and the incomparable number eight than it is to say October 17, 2010 episode.
[40:54.000 --> 41:08.000]  Was that the, was that the gap in my appearances on the incomparable? Because we laughed about it. I was just on recently, like you just said, to talk about the Godfather, uh, with John Sirkusa and a few other, uh, uh, I forget their names. Sorry.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  There was a bunch.
[41:10.000 --> 41:23.000]  It was great. I had a great time. Uh, I can't count the number of people who made the crack on Twitter that they can't believe that all of us long-winded podcasters made a podcast about the Godfather that was shorter than the Godfather.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  I know.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  Um, but it was at it that I hadn't been on since Raiders, which was episode eight.
[41:30.000 --> 41:42.000]  Yeah, that was six, basically six years, October 10 to October 16. Other than that day, we, you were in, I interviewed for my David Letterman episode, which was last year, but, but in terms of like being on the panel, yeah, we went from eight to three 23.
[41:42.000 --> 41:54.000]  It's fine. It's fine. I tried a couple of times to get you on and it's like, you're busy and, and I, I want to like with Merlin, I kind of want to deploy you guys tactically. I don't want to be like, I want to ask you when there's something, I got this really good.
[41:54.000 --> 42:02.000]  And it was like, I, for like a couple of years, I've been thinking we're going to do the Godfather. I'm going to get Sirkusa. I'm going to ask John Gruber where, you know, we're, we're going to make it happen. And we finally made it happen. It was great.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  I'm going to talk about Abe Vigoda, you know, any chance to talk about Abe Vigoda is worth it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  Although we didn't make it happen until Abe Vigoda was actually dead.
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  Yeah. Well, that's true. Maybe, maybe that was what I was waiting for. Just, I wanted Abe to pass on before we talked about him.
[42:16.000 --> 42:31.000]  This is so amazing. I literally at just five seconds ago, got a DM from Rich Siegel, creator of BB Edit, asking if I'd heard that Sal had left Apple.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Yeah.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  I was spooked. I was like, is he listening? Do we have a live broadcast that I don't know about?
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  I should have turned off the live stream for being comfortable.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  But then I realized we're talking about him.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  Well, then I realized that asking have I heard means he's not spooking.
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  But that was kind of spooky, given that we, we spent a good chunk of the last 45 minutes talking about BB Edit and automation and Sal.
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.000]  Yeah.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  New MacBook Pros.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Yeah.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.000]  I read I really enjoyed your review.
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  I often think when I write these reviews, I don't know if you feel the same way, but I write them.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  And sometimes I feel like I know that I've got this.
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  Like I might say I don't, you know, I don't care if other people agree with me or not.
[43:22.000 --> 43:31.000]  But my I know that what I'm saying about this, I'm certain of other times I feel like I haven't had enough time or it's it's.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  A lot of times it's just that I feel like I haven't had enough time.
[43:34.000 --> 43:41.000]  But other times it's like I'm not sure that what I care about is representative of enough people.
[43:41.000 --> 43:49.000]  And I kind of had that worry with the review I wrote of these MacBook Pros.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  Because I know that there's a lot of people who are disappointed in just the basic idea of the direction Apple is taking them.
[43:56.000 --> 44:04.000]  But I read a whole bunch of the reviews from people who I really respect, like you and Joanna Stern.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  It goes on and I read a whole bunch of them after, you know, after after my review.
[44:08.000 --> 44:16.000]  And it really seemed to me like a very large consensus that these are pretty good machines.
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.000]  Yeah, I tried to I mean, because of the way it got kind of strung out, I got to write a piece
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  after the Apple event with that was basically quick hands on with that 13 inch MacBook escape.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  And then I got to I got to use it for a week and travel and then write another piece about it.
[44:33.000 --> 44:39.000]  So by the time I got to the touch bar one, I felt like I kind of addressed the issues about like people's disappointment.
[44:39.000 --> 44:46.000]  I wrote, I think, a Mac world column about people's disappointment and what that meant for like why kind of Apple let everything build up.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  And people kind of this was a thing they could focus some of their disappointment and let it out.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  And so I felt like by the time I got to the touch bar review, I could it was great because I could just write about the touch bar.
[44:58.000 --> 45:04.000]  It was like I wrote a couple sections about the rest of the computer, but really, it was an essay about the touch bar and touch ID,
[45:04.000 --> 45:09.000]  because that was the thing that was was left and frankly, was the thing I found most interesting.
[45:09.000 --> 45:15.000]  And it's really why I honestly, I'm not just saying it because you're on the show and you're a pal.
[45:15.000 --> 45:29.000]  It's really why I of all the reviews, I really think I liked yours best because I spent a relatively little amount on touch bar just because I had so much else to say about sort of the bigger picture.
[45:29.000 --> 45:44.000]  And the other thing I thought was that your video, which focused almost entirely on the touch bar, was super instructive in in like a in the difference between like the way Apple would do a promotional video about the touch bar.
[45:44.000 --> 45:52.000]  In fact, did and they showed it during the event. Yours was focused on look, when you're doing real stuff like here's, you know, just stupid little things.
[45:52.000 --> 46:03.000]  You know, like the fact that you can when you adjust the brightness or the volume, you can just put your finger on it and slide without tapping on the actual thing that shows up.
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  It illustrated in a way that I feel like 10,000 words wouldn't have conveyed.
[46:08.000 --> 46:17.000]  You really it's a visual. It's clearly a very visual input device. And so I feel like the video really helped. Have you done video reviews before?
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  I've done a handful of them. I mean, I did some a Mac world.
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  And then since I've been doing six colors, I've done a few, you know, they take time.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  And the challenge is always, am I doing this because everybody agrees that video is the future and we need to do video?
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  Or am I doing it because video will be able to impart something that's worth imparting?
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  And for me, it really is like I will put in the time if I feel like this is going to be the best way to communicate something.
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.000]  And with the touch bar, it was very clear. This was the way to I needed to communicate what was going on with the touch bar.
[46:46.000 --> 46:52.000]  And I had the time. I finished that review basically on Friday afternoon and the embargo was Monday morning.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  And so on the weekend, on like the Sunday morning, I basically sat down and said, all right, let's figure out if I can make a video here.
[46:57.000 --> 47:07.000]  And I ended up with like an iPhone 7 on a in a glyph attached to a like a little tripod and then a bigger tripod.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  And I tried to figure out, like, could I get an angle where I can see the touch bar and it's not blown out?
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  And then I can capture the screen and kind of put them together.
[47:15.000 --> 47:22.000]  And in the end, it did work, which is good, because that's what I wanted is like I wanted people to be able to see, like, what happens on screen?
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  What happens on the touch bar? Where do your fingers go? What's the result?
[47:25.000 --> 47:34.000]  Can you see the animations? Can you see how some of the apps have these totally wild like slider interfaces and others just have keys?
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  Some of them color the keys. Some of them don't color the keys.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.000]  And until, you know, there will be it's a little harder because you can't like do a screen capture of it.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  So it's harder to make those videos. And I had the advantage of having some time to shoot the video.
[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  And I figured out of the gate, there aren't going to be that many videos that explain this feature.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  And Apple's videos are probably not what people want to see because they're going to be really slick.
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  But they're not necessarily I mean, the marketing videos, they're not going to be necessarily like slowed down enough for people to see what's going on.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  And in the end, it was about five minutes long, which, you know, I kind of feel like could be too long.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  But at the same time, I felt like I really packed it in with stuff.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  So but it was worth doing because of that, because it was it was how much how many words like you said,
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  how many words would I have had to try to write to convey what I could just show in a video?
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.000]  Yeah, I honestly feel like that's the sort of thing that just can't be done verbally.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  And, you know, I even even just little things like, look, here's what it looks like in this app.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  Here's what it looks like in this app. And they're all sort of monochromatic.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  And you can go through a bunch of stuff in the touch bar apps, you know,
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  switching from app to app and, you know, doing things and using the control strip.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  And it almost feels like a monochrome screen.
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.000]  And then all of a sudden you're in something like maps and it's it is all lit up like Times Square.
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  And I'm not saying that's wrong yet. But it is, you know, it is such a different thing, though.
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  And all of a sudden, when your keyboard like maps is probably the best example.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  But it it when your keyboard lights up with all those colors, it is a weird different thing,
[49:14.000 --> 49:22.000]  because I've been using laptops for, I don't know, a long time.
[49:22.000 --> 49:29.000]  You know, at least 15, 16, 17 years since I first bought one and had one at the school paper before that.
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  So, you know, probably 20 years. My keyboards never lit up in color before.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  It was surprisingly weird to me. It really was.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  When you get the burst of color, it really was surprisingly interesting to me.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  Yeah, the calculator is the other one that struck me because there are a few of those keys are like in orange.
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.000]  They're like super bright. And they're still keys, but they're super bright that maps.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  It's it's basically putting up the same icons that are in iOS and they're very colorful.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  That is the by far the most colorful implementation of sort of standard buttons.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  But like the calculator, I thought calculator was really instructive, not only in the use of color,
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  but both calculator and James Thompson's PCALC app.
[50:09.000 --> 50:17.000]  Those were both instructive to me in realizing that what I think is the right way to handle the touch bar
[50:17.000 --> 50:21.000]  is as an extension of the keyboard and not, I mean, when all the questions of like,
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  why wouldn't why would you need a touch bar? Why wouldn't you just want to use the Mac interface?
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  It was that idea of I don't know how to do this with the keyboard,
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  which means that I'm going to get to a certain point where I have to take my hands off the keyboard,
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  move down to the trackpad and click on some UI on the screen.
[50:39.000 --> 50:47.000]  And so the calculator was that moment where I realized, oh, I can put like square root and cube root and log and sine and cosine on the touch bar.
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  And I can do numbers and then immediately just move my hands slightly up and go tap.
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  And now I've got a result or or conversion Fahrenheit to Celsius or something.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  And my hands stay. I was already up on the number row. Right.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  And my hands just move up. And that was that moment where I thought, oh, yeah, this is why this is this is where this shines,
[51:05.000 --> 51:11.000]  is I just stay on the keyboard and the touch bar kind of just as an extension of the keyboard that.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  And is that how everybody's going to use it? I don't know. It's so early.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  We don't really know. But it felt to me like that was the moment that unlocked.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  Like, I see why you would use this.
[51:21.000 --> 51:30.000]  And when I James sent me a beta of pcalc, where when you tap the function keys, it brought up a palette of all his functions in the UI.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  And what that meant was I tapped the touch bar and then I had to take my hands off the keyboard,
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  move to the trackpad and then move the cursor up and then click on which one I wanted.
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  And I sent him an email back and I said, you know, I think this is wrong.
[51:43.000 --> 51:50.000]  I think what you need is to put your functions in the touch bar because because it feels like a defeat.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  If I touch the touch bar and then I have to take my hands off of it and move around with a cursor.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  And so he changed it. And now it's like your most recent functions and conversions appear in the touch bar.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  And it's like night and day because now I type in 32 and I tap conversion Fahrenheit to Celsius.
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.000]  And that and it all happens on the touch bar and I never have to sort of switch modes to mousing around.
[52:13.000 --> 52:21.000]  Yeah. And I think that calculator is the Apple's calculator is an interesting example in a couple of ways.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  I my gut feeling is that that's one of the apps that got it most right.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  Yeah, me too.
[52:29.000 --> 52:37.000]  And one thing, too, and I know Apple said this is true, but my experience testing the device is that it is clear that.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  Apple's Mac app engineering teams spent a lot of time working on touch bar support for their apps,
[52:43.000 --> 52:49.000]  because there are obviously some of the oddball apps like the ones that are in applications slash utilities.
[52:49.000 --> 52:54.000]  You know, only two of those got updated. Did you really go through everyone? I did.
[52:54.000 --> 53:03.000]  I did. You want to hear the list review, but it's like so so you activity monitor.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  That's the one that gets me activity monitor. And terminal are the two utilities that go.
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.000]  I knew about terminal. I forgot about right. I forgot the terminal was that was buried away in utilities.
[53:13.000 --> 53:18.000]  I use it. But but they also updated. And this is some of their stock and some of them are their sort of app store apps.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  But calculator, calendar, contacts, finder, Final Cut Pro, Garage Band, iMovie, iTunes, Keynote, Mail, Maps,
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.000]  Messages, Numbers, Pages, Photos, Preview, Quicktime Player, Safari, System Preferences.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  And then there are a bunch of apps that use the sort of standard text editing interface and they pick up a text editor touch bar interface.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  So like text edit and and notes get that get that text editing to.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  So there's like there's like more than a dozen. They did a lot.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  I mean, for people who say Apple doesn't care about the Mac, it's like they built this whole new bit of hardware.
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.000]  And then they updated all of these Mac apps to support it. That was a lot of work. Right.
[53:55.000 --> 54:01.000]  And there's a lot of work in. I might be missing something, actually.
[54:01.000 --> 54:11.000]  But there's there's the the hardware engineering work of actually putting an embedded iOS device into the keyboard with this every system on a chip.
[54:11.000 --> 54:22.000]  And having a a way that it can interface with the Intel side, you've got like this arm little arm computer running on your keyboard and it communicates with the Intel side.
[54:22.000 --> 54:28.000]  And the Intel side even does the because the one of the things that the iOS device on the touch bar doesn't have is a GPU.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  So the Intel side does the GPU rendering and has to go back.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  But it's all done securely. And there's a whole bunch of electrical engineering going on there.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  That's it just you'd never know it. Right.
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  You know, it's 60 frames per second, just like iOS. It's instantaneous touch.
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  It's just like, you know, you'd expect from any Apple iOS touch device.
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  So there's the engine, the physical hardware engineering of that.
[54:58.000 --> 55:09.000]  There's the and then the second level is the Mac programming side where all of these apps were updated with whether they got it right or wrong.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  None of them seemed half assed. They all seemed like a lot of thought went into it.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  All of these apps got updated with touch bar support, which is a lot of work.
[55:19.000 --> 55:36.000]  But then in between those two, there's the Xcode side where the the people who work on the APIs and Xcode itself had to do all the work to make it so that Mac developers have APIs and, you know, a simulator.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  So they can test it on machines that don't actually have a touch bar and all of that stuff.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  So an awful lot of work went into this. And I completely agree.
[55:43.000 --> 55:52.000]  It's it's to me, example number one, that whatever else is going on with the Mac and some of the machines that have gone way too long without getting updated.
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.000]  It's clear that Apple is invested in the Mac. I really think the touch bar is is proof of it.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  Yeah. And we can debate. And I've been trying to make this distinction for the last couple of weeks.
[56:03.000 --> 56:11.000]  It's like part of what I think a lot of us do is try to understand why Apple is doing what Apple's motivation is, why Apple made the choices it made.
[56:11.000 --> 56:22.000]  And I want to separate that from the judgments about whether these are good decisions or not, because I think we could debate whether doing the touch bar is a good decision or not.
[56:22.000 --> 56:30.000]  And we can debate the price of these systems and we can debate, you know, there's so many aspects of this that we can that we can talk about.
[56:30.000 --> 56:46.000]  But I think you can't debate the fact that Apple made a major investment in the Mac platform in this in this this particular computer, because we're seeing a huge bit of hardware engineering happening here and a whole lot of software engineering happening here.
[56:46.000 --> 56:57.000]  So we can we you know, we can debate whether we think this is the right approach, whether this was a waste of time, whether having a laptop focused input device method is good or bad, if it's going to be a gimmick.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  There's all those things, but you can't debate. It was a huge investment on Apple's part to do this.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  And if they really didn't care about the Mac, why would they do it?
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  Right, exactly.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  Just do another laptop with the latest Intel chips and move on, right? I mean, they could do that.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  Yeah. Here's why I think calculators is a great example.
[57:15.000 --> 57:32.000]  The Apple calculator app is a great example because the buttons so Apple it at least I don't know, ever since like iOS seven or so and then when you know the the Yosemite whenever the Mac version was that got the sort of iOS style visual refresh.
[57:32.000 --> 57:38.000]  Apple has a very consistent calculator look, and it's, you know, mostly based on the color orange.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  Yeah, they, you know, orange buttons.
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.000]  So when those buttons are on the keyboard, it makes the keyboard look calculator branded right like in.
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.000]  So if you use Apple's calculator, you know what it looks like. It's got this sort of just orange calculator.
[57:54.000 --> 58:02.000]  Look, you see these buttons that are orange and it's it to me is a very cool way of making the touch bar feel like it's part of the app.
[58:02.000 --> 58:13.000]  It's a really cool move and all of the all of the functions that are in orange on the UI are orange on the touch bar.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  And so it's like, yeah, you mean you immediately get it. You're like, oh, yeah, right. Like they of course they are. Of course, the equals button is orange.
[58:19.000 --> 58:32.000]  So I when I was at the event and I got to talk to people at Apple and they showed me the calendar and they said a couple of the people I spoke to said this is one of my favorite examples.
[58:32.000 --> 58:40.000]  I know it sounds silly, but they showed me calculator. And then at first, like in the default calculator mode, the only buttons you have up there are divide times minus plus equals.
[58:40.000 --> 58:52.000]  And they said, no, that seems silly because those buttons are there. You know, you can hit shift on the equals key to get plus. And, you know, it's it's not like you can't type that.
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  But they said like it.
[58:55.000 --> 59:06.000]  In our testing with the team that was using it, we found that we loved this and surprising how many people on the Apple inside Apple who had access to this and were working on it,
[59:06.000 --> 59:23.000]  loved the calculator thing because all of a sudden, you know, it it makes your laptop keyboard feel more like having that extended keyboard that has the thing on the right side where you have number pads and dedicated buttons for those features.
[59:23.000 --> 59:29.000]  Right. There's a reason why some people who enter numbers a lot like having an extended keyboard that has that keypad over there.
[59:29.000 --> 59:43.000]  It gives you sort of the now the number layout maybe isn't quite as convenient having a horizontal row of numbers, but not having to worry about ever hitting shift or the fact that that they're not consecutive, you know, that minus is right there.
[59:43.000 --> 59:54.000]  But plus, you have to hit shift to get I mean, it's all sort of weird typing those those operators on the keyboard on a regular keyboard with you don't have a numpad with the touch bar.
[59:54.000 --> 59:57.000]  It really is natural.
[59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  Yeah, I mean, you could argue that calculator is the best example and that that they really do run the gamut.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  I do think that this is going to be an interface playground where we're going to learn a lot in the next year or two where Apple and third party developers try a bunch of stuff and find out what the right approach is because it's all over the map.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Now, like how calculator is a good example because there are there are buttons you want to press that aren't on keys like there is no I mean, there's an equals key and there's a there's a plus and minus and you know, but like multiplication is the asterisk and division is the slash and it's like no.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  No, we're just going to put the symbols on the on these virtual keys at the top.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  It's like that is the like almost purest example where there are things you want to type that you don't know what keys to press. So we're going to just draw those keys on the touch bar and you know, now, you know how to press them and you go all the way down to something like final cut, which is this incredibly intricate context based set of sometimes it's buttons.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Sometimes it's got like sliders and scrubbers and things and you know, and then there's a bunch of stuff that's in between where some some of them you look at it and you go. I don't know if this is very useful and then others you you look at and like maps and you're like, whoa, you know, what am I what am I seeing now?
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  There's a there's a I can tap the the gas station button now and it'll show me all the gas stations around me and and I think over time we'll figure out what philosophically like what's the right approach? What do people what looks good and what do people actually want to use?
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  I found safaris to be useless and I have to admit I have to admit that I didn't spend a lot of time configuring the touch bar and a lot of apps just because I ran out of time and I feel like I will, you know, once I'm using a touch bar equipped MacBook Pro as my, you know, main laptop.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  I will get in to do that, but I found safaris default implementation to be useless, which is that it shows thumbnails of your tabs in your current window and I mean, maybe during fireball is identifiable because it looks like a gray button, but they just look like a bunch of almost every web page just shrunk to that size is indistinguishable.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  They're just little white with things, you know, little white with gray.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  It's just too small. I couldn't possibly use that.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  I also am a little bit baffled and I say this also. This is a larger complaint. I have is they added these these tabs Safari tabs in El Capitan and I like them and I use them, but they're not on iOS to this day and they're not in the touch bar, which also kind of baffles me like I've told you I want these, you know, these sites and they've got these nice little icons and they're important enough that I want you to keep them tabbed all the time.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Oh, the pen tabs, you mean? Yeah, the pen tabs are not accessible either. So it's a little bit and yeah, the graphic that's a great example of like, well, we can do graphic previews of all the pages that you've got in your tabs and make it a slider.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  It's like, well, that sounds great. That's a really cool way of showing that this is a feature that has more than just buttons in it, but in practice, I don't think it makes any sense.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  I don't think it works at all. And that that's the there are a bunch of things like that. That's like, you know, I get why you did it, but I honest to God, I feel embarrassed that I didn't even look because it maybe I actually you maybe you can actually go in and configure it to do this.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  But so if it's already there, I'm going to go after we're done recording, I'm going to go set up my my review unit to do this, but I think it should be the default.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  I in my gut is I think that Safari should just default to putting next tab previous tab buttons up in the don't show me one just say next tab previous tab and make them nice and big and have them say next tab previous tab.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Oh, yeah. No, it's got backward and forward.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  Yeah, I don't want back one forward. I want next tab previous tab because I feel that the shortcuts for that is kind of convoluted. It's it's like control tab and control shift tab, which is really a finger full.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  So you get that you get that with those visual previews. I do wonder and I suspect that there's a guideline somewhere that I haven't seen because I'm not a developer. I do wonder about the touch bar being used for informational purposes if somebody laid down an edict that like information that isn't permanent.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  That's like temporary text should not go in the touch bar because like I'm baffled why the now playing in the control strip brings up a scrubber for iTunes, which is like I'm never going to scrub for music, but it might be kind of fun to if I pop that open to see the name of the song.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  I'm listening to it's not there and it won't it'll show you in Safari. It'll show you little tiny thumbnails of part of the page of the web page that you're you've got loaded in your tabs.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  But what it won't do is put up like the name of that tab of that page, which would be more way more useful and I wonder if they've decided like no ephemeral kind of like text labels of what's in a page is not something you should do in the touch bar.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  I'm not sure I agree with that, but I it seems like there's a rule at work here that they don't want to put like a text readout. It's only for controls not for information and even then I would say but but a sliver of a horizontal sliver of a web page as a preview is useless to me too.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  I am reminded and I skimmed the user interface guidelines for the touch bar. I should get go back to that and read them read them thoroughly, but I can't help but think that no matter how well written that document is just the evidence of using all of Apple's apps is that it's still sort of a Wild West and they're feeling and now the third party developers can get in on it.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  We collectively are feeling our way to how we should use it and what I'm reminded of is how in the very early years of the original Mac. Let's say somewhere around 1984 to 89 or so.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  I would say it took four or five years. The Mac was famous for its human interface guidelines right from the beginning and that there was consistency in a toolbox that developers could use so everybody's alert will look the same but you go back and look at screenshots from like there.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  You know, almost close to the 90s. I'd say right around system six is where things got very definitively, you know, Matt. Oh, that's Mac like or this app was clearly written by a developer who does not know the Mac. You just see stupid things like somebody who spelled.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  Okay. Okay. A why in a diagonal button right like to a Mac users eyes that it just jumps right out as and that's a mistake right you do not spell. Okay. Okay. Why but if you look back at like 84 85 86 like Mac dialogues, you'd see that all the time and you are just weird layout, you know, like not having a default button in a dialogue right things that you are putting the default button not in the bottom right question.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  Not in the bottom right corner. It just things that eventually became like what's the word idiomatic right idiomatic Mac UI design. We don't have that yet. That's the what's an idiomatic design for the touch bar of an app the touch bar interface for an app. What type of features are should go in there by default. We don't have it yet.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Yeah, and and I'm excited by the fact. I mean you could argue like maybe apples app should show a little more unification than they than they have but I'm okay with it the way it is which is everybody. It looks like with some rules and restrictions. Everybody has tried to develop the right approach for their app and their content and their users and and sort of let the chips fall where they may and I think that's great because I I mean right now.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  I think I could say with certainty that there are apps that do it wrong and that do it right and we can argue about which is which but like there is such a variation and maybe it'll turn out that something like what Final Cut does is totally the right way to do it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Which is you got sliders and you know, you're you're intensively using it like that like the DJ app on stage right and maybe you know, if I had to choose I would guess that maybe we're going to back off of that and say actually what we saw with DJ and Photoshop what we see with Final Cut Pro is maybe too far too intense too much of a UI instead of a set of shortcuts and you know, and maybe we'll back off of it.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  Maybe not maybe it'll turn out that that UI is what people love and it's having that surface. There is the best thing in the world, but my gut feeling is that it's like that's a big that's a big step to go and I'm not sure that it's the right approach, but I'm sure people at Apple were debating it too and it doesn't have to be one of the other.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I mean it right now and right now it isn't in fact my biggest criticism of Final Cut is more that it's so complicated that it seems to be not customizable in any way and and that's for me the fact that they went back to this classic like from 10.0 customized toolbar interface to cut let people customize the touch bar.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  I really like that because it should be personal. You should be putting the stuff on it that you care about the most and I don't know how many people do that, but I'm glad that that's there and that it is customizable. I worried that it wasn't. I mean the next step should probably be to make the left third parties have access to the control strip.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  But one thing at a time. And I really like it just feels so Mac like in terms of the way that the customization feels exactly like customizing the toolbar in a window in a cocoa app. It's by design and it's no surprise, but it really just goes to show that the people who wrote these API's knew what they were doing and they did it the right way.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And I you know it I always say when they show these things on stage and people ask afterward. I'm sure they do the same to you like well what what do you think a lot of it's like well look good. Let's see what the details are and when I first customize the toolbar.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  I was like oh wow OK good like they did a really good job like I had this whole worry about how do you use like you move the cursor to the bottom of the screen and it like disappears and suddenly you get a selection in a toolbar, but you in the touch bar, but you don't see your cursor anymore, but it's still sort of.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  There as a ghost and you can move it around and then if you move it back up it pops back out on the bottom of your display. I'm like that's weird. How are they going to do that? And when I used it, I was like well, it makes perfect sense like they nailed it.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  They they really did figure out a way to do it where you never feel like suddenly your pointing device is gone into a different parallel universe and nothing makes sense anymore like it all held together and I'm impressed by by the kind of care that they took with that stuff.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  It's a little thing, but I appreciate so when you go into editing mode the buttons that are there jiggle. It's a little similar to.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  You know very similar and it clearly drawn from the home screen customization in iOS where if you want to move your apps around in iOS, you know you hold the home button and you go into the mode and all your apps jiggle.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  It's a good way of playing off something people are familiar with.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  I feel like that that idea that way if you're going to put them in reorder mode make them you know jiggle around but what I really like is that to me. I think it's it feels just slightly more of a of a serious jiggle than the iOS jiggle like the iOS one to move.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  More or less in a goofy way and the kind of twist yeah they twist and the Mac ones just kind of go back and forth and now maybe part of that is that it's just horizontal maybe they you know, but I think they could have made him twist if they wanted to even if it made the corners.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  You know go off the top it just feels more appropriate to the Mac in a way that the Mac is is is a more serious platform than iOS.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  I do like the personality. I mean that's one of the things I said my review that you quote that you quoted. I always I always have the moment like if John links to me what what part will he quote and and that one was that it's just it's a reporting a true feeling I had which is this has more personality than I thought it would like the Anna.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  It has a lot of animations. I think if you just read about this feature you would not imagine that that everything animates and like the touch ID sensor when it comes on there is this arrow and the arrow like stretches like it's made of rubber as it points at the touch ID sensor and it is.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  I mean, it's not wacky no, but it is whimsical in a way that it totally didn't need to be and and there's just little stuff like that that I think you know there is there is personality here.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  It isn't just this kind of Gray we gave we made you a toolbar enjoy. It's like a little bit more enthusiastic and and and I like that.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  I like that it's got person. It's a Mac like whimsical ness though that that touch here to log in with you know touch ID and it and the arrow, you know stretching that to me feels right for the Mac and it should be it would it should be if they did something similar on iOS.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  It would be more whimsical and appropriately so yeah, I think I think that's right Horace.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  I quoted this thing that Horace did you wrote a week or two ago where he wrote a piece about see if I can find it here.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  I love that piece I did too, but you know, where's Apple going with the Macintosh and you know an analogy about you know, why isn't the Mac a touch screen and I'll put the link again in the show notes. So anybody who hasn't read it can do it where for art though Macintosh, but he wrote.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Let's see if I can find the quote.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  It cannot take on the role of being the future. He's talking about the Mac that belongs to the touch screen devices. It will not morph into a touch screen device any more than a tech a teen's parent will become cool by putting on skinny jeans.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  What it will do is become better.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  At what it is hired to do I'll put a link in the show notes is I promise I'm doing it right now. I'm copying pasting. I'm so infamous for saying I'll put something here is copy.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  The it's great. I mean, I wrote a piece about the same time called like parallel or perpendicular philosophy and it's the same thing. It's like why does Microsoft insist on doing these touch screen things and everybody's like Oh God. I can't believe Apple's not doing him. It's like well number one reason is Apple already has a touch screen OS. So what Apple is doing is differentiating.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  They're saying and this can be hard for Mac users to hear. Although I don't mind it. It's like the Mac is like the classic computing metaphor that Apple makes and you can't push it too far because it becomes an iPad or an iPhone then and they've already got that like they don't need to do a touch screen tablet like they have a touch screen tablet already.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  So the Mac has to be defined by some fundamental premises and Apple and again, you could debate it and say no, no, no Microsoft's doing the right thing. But what Apple has decided and they've done this again and again, they've set it publicly repeatedly is the Mac is for traditional computing with a pointing device and in the case of a laptop.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  It's very clear. It's two perpendicular surfaces, but it's even true on the desktop. You've got your keyboard tray or the bottom of your laptop and that's the control surface and it's got the keys and it's got the touch bar maybe and it's got the trackpad and then you got the screen and this stuff happens on the screen and you control it from the from the perpendicular surface that's in front of you and if you would rather directly manipulate with your hands, that's fine.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  That's not what a Mac is. Macs aren't for that. This adult with becoming a cool by putting on skinny jeans is the best. It's the best metaphor I've seen because I didn't think of it. He did, but I love it and to me the way that Apple has adopted some of these things like the animation for that arrow is exactly the same way where it's not trying to be iOS.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  It's not trying to be, you know, it's doing it in a Macintosh way and I have to say personally on the flip side. I got to spend I spent like half an hour in a Microsoft store when I was in San Francisco last month for the Apple event and they had a the new surface.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  I don't know what they call it surface the studio. Yeah, surface studio had a couple of them set up.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  And a whole bunch of apps like Photoshop and and and stuff and there wasn't you know, it was it wasn't that crowded.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  They're actually I'm not making fun of them for having stores that aren't crowded. There was actually a line for people to try out the VR thing they had set up. So there was a thing there that was drawing a crowd of it seemed to me like at least 10 people at a time constantly waiting to try the VR thing.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  So there is something there that is drawing people in the store, but that the surface wasn't so I got to play with it and old person trying to dress like a teenager is exactly that it's better than anything.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:45.000]  I could say I had other complaints about like the latency compared to the Apple pencil on iPad there. It was low latency. I mean Microsoft is, you know, definitely did some work on that, but it was not like Apple pencil.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  But the weirdest part was the way that that just exactly what you would think like having a mouse based interface, but then using touch and a pencil to do things was weird like where all of a sudden as your pencil gets near you see a cursor on screen right beneath it.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  And it's like weird, you know, I feel like I'm using it's not that much better than one of those airport terminals where you get your boarding pass and every time you touch the screen the windows mouse cursor moves to where you touch it.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  It just feels like old person dressing like a teenager is exact. I can't think of anything better than that and I would just break my heart to see Apple do that to the Mac.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  I guess the one thing that if I extended to Horace's metaphor a little bit is it is possible for something theoretically for something like Windows to have a like a chrysalis and like turn into a teenager right.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  I mean they could evolve Windows to the point where it is a touch interface. The problem is they've got everybody who's using Windows PCs and they don't want to you know, they don't have a they tried it right.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  They tried it with with Metro and with their arm based stuff and in the end the they retreated back to the power of their successful Windows platform and they've made it better.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  But like they have one operating system and they can change the context but it's one operating system and there are challenges with that and I don't you know, it's not that they're not unsolvable.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  They may be solvable but it's like I I'm not saying that fundamentally Microsoft is right or wrong or Apple is right or wrong.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  But if you look at what the assets of both companies are Microsoft has this incredibly successful desktop operating system traditional computer operating system and they haven't done anything in mobile.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  So what do you do to get to to approach sort of like the mobile world and the touch base world?
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  You got to take Windows and you got to jam it in there and if you're Apple you got the Mac you got iOS.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  They're fine. You don't need to do that. So they're not going to do that.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  And so when people say, you know, one of them is right and one of them is wrong that may well be I'm not quite sure it's that clear.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  I think it may be a much more kind of shades of gray situation depends on your use cases and who knows where we'll be in five or 10 years.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  But I would I would argue both companies are doing what makes sense for them because you know, Microsoft has the assets it has and Apple is very Apple is extremely fortunate.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  In fact, they're basically the only company in the world who has a very successful touch based operating system and a traditional computer operating system and so they don't need to jam together.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  They can just keep them apart and everybody like us who's like I love the Mac.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]  I want to keep using the Mac.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  They're not going to make a Mac that's totally unrecognizable because at that point, why wouldn't you just use a PC or or switch and use an iPad?
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  So the you know that Apple has the luxury of doing that and it makes perfect sense that that's what they're doing.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  And I also will say that I found Windows 10 running on the surface.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  What's it called again?
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  The studio studio surface studio.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  I was very lost and confused just going between apps and navigating the system and it it there were I found it.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  I honestly found it confusing and part of it is just that I haven't used Windows regularly in over a decade.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  Yeah, but it's very all my Windows skills were really good up to a point.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  And then they Windows has evolved enough now because I've got Windows 10 on my iMac and boot camp and Windows has evolved to the point where all my old Windows skills,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  which were pretty good are just useless.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Now I have no idea what I'm looking at so that that doesn't help.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  But I will say that I've spent time a few years ago with like when the original surfaces and I didn't find those confusing at all.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  Now, I didn't really love the whole idea where you can go into traditional Windows mouse mouse pointer mode and run your traditional Windows software and you go into this other mode,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  the metro mode, and it's all touch based.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  But I got it because the metro thing was clear, like, oh, these are big, chunky touch targets.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  And and instead of tiled windows there, you know, they're going on more of a 2D thing and you swipe side to side.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  And this is, you know, all new and everything is big and, you know, big thumb sizable touch targets.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Oh, and if I want to run my, you know, my, you know, Microsoft Excel, I switched to this other mode and it looks exactly like Excel.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  I know exactly where. Plug in a mouse.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  I guess I can see why they went away from that and why people rejected it.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  But it it made way more sense to me to go that way.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  And I think part of it was like under Stanofsky, they clearly wanted to because they had the the arm based surface tablets that only had the metro mode.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  And I really feel like that's where some of them, the ones who have good taste in Microsoft, wanted to go like good taste in the Apple sense.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And it was a much to me, a much more compelling device.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  And I think it only failed because it didn't get developer support that developers kept writing the old classic, you know, Windows Win 32 API apps.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  So I was I was at the conference when they did that demo for the first time.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  And I remember seeing all the metro stuff and thinking, you know, with the original surface and thinking, damn, that is really good.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Here comes Microsoft. You know, everybody watch out.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  And then they did that moment where they're like, and if you want to run Office instead of showing what I expected to see, which was like a demo of a touch based Office, like Office or iPad is today.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  And they were like, boom, now you're in the Windows desktop and you plug in a mouse and a keyboard and you have a PC.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  And I thought, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  I remember, you know, I wrote a piece.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  You wrote a piece about it.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  We were talking about it.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  And it's like, no, no, you're so close.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  And I still believe, like, the right thing to do was for Microsoft to say, we have taken all our knowledge of Windows and we have built a touch based operating system that will, you know, it's related.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  And if Steve Ballmer wants to call it Windows something, we'll call it that.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  But it's different.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  And the Windows RT was like that, but it was like already compromised and half-hearted, like they had already kind of sold it out.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  That all said, given the strength of Apple and Google in mobile operating systems and what has happened with all of Microsoft's attempts to make just a mobile operating system,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  I'm not really convinced now that even if they had done what I think would have been the best product, that anybody would have bought it.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Because they would have been selling, they couldn't have leveraged any of their or much of their strength, which was Windows, to get people on board.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  So they'd be starting from scratch like they did with Windows Phone.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  And so, you know, I think it would have been a way better product, but I feel like by the time they got to Metro and making that demo, the ship had kind of sailed already.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  Which is too bad because it was cool.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Yeah, I think it was the right thing to do from a design perspective, but it was not going to work from a market perspective.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  It just wasn't going to gain traction.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  I don't know that there's anything they could have done to make Metro better, just better in terms of if we had done a better job designing it, if we'd done a better job making the initial set of apps, it would have succeeded.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  I don't think it failed because it wasn't good enough.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  I think it failed for other reasons.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And it's tough because you look at Microsoft and, you know, Microsoft's ambition was that of a dominant operating system vendor.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  But their position was that of a newcomer, essentially, because, you know, Android and iOS gobbled that market up very quickly.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  And they were left kind of with not a whole lot.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Like they were there in the Blackberry camp down and also receiving votes were these people with five percent of the market.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  And that's tough.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  That's a tough position to be in.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000]  I don't, you know, I love a lot of what Microsoft's doing now, but it's still a tough position to be in because they do need to be Windows and try to innovate.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  And, you know, I know a lot of people, especially creative people, people who use pen input all the time on their Mac with a tablet and all that, people who are really kind of going ape over the surface studio.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  And I'm not one of those people.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  So it didn't really thrill me.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And in fact, when I looked at it, I thought I would much I think I would much rather have a desktop iPad.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  But that's me.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I will say this.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  If you draw for a living, I don't know if you draw comics, if you are an architect or something like that, I can totally see how the tablet is a device for you.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  But I don't I don't see any reason to like that device if you're not if you're not someone who makes a living with a pen in your hand.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  The funny thing and then there's this is part of the people coming back to people being grumpy with Apple about various things.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  It's like one of the things I've seen, it's like, yeah, if you're a cartoonist or a comic book artist or anybody who is who is using these certain kind of inputs, there is going to be a class of user for whom the surface studio is the perfect computer.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  And you know what?
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  A lot of those people are going to be loyal Mac users and they're going to they're going to feel torn and they're going to feel like Apple has left, let them down a little bit because Apple isn't providing them with that same kind of product.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  And all of those feelings are valid.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  But I would also say it's also valid for Apple to say we're never going to make a product like that.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  Like that is not how big how big a market is that?
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  How many how many surface studios are going to sell?
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Right.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  I mean, it's a cool product that will be perfect for a very specific group of people.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And they should love it because, you know, because it's it's made for them and it's brilliant for them.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  But I'm not sure that I can see the logic of Apple like making their next iMac like a surface studio.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  I could see not in the very near future, not within the next handful of years, but I could see with it in 10 years, I could see Apple having a 30 inch iOS device.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Oh, I agree.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  I mean, that's that's the at some point I was talking to somebody about it and that's what I said is it's way more likely that Apple makes a giant iPad.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  Then they make a touch screen Mac on your desk.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  Way more likely.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Way more likely.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  I had so much more likely that, you know, says the guy says the guy who thought Hillary Clinton was locked to win.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  That's right. Are you the guy from Princeton who said it was a 99 percent or Nate Silver who said it was, you know, two to one odds?
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Because that makes the difference there.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  Oh, I woke up loving that guy from Princeton and I woke up the next day wanting to have a talk with him.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  He wrote a blog post and it's just kind of hilarious because it's like, dude, you said greater than 99 percent probability.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  I don't think you know how probability works like that was and that was Nate Silver.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  People were really ragging on Nate Silver about it, not to get too much into the election, but it's like Nate Silver all along.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  He got crap from so many people saying Donald Trump had a chance.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  He's like, look, if we miss our numbers up, then she's going to have a she's going to have a sweep.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  But if we miss the if the polls are all off 2 percent down, which like by less than they were off for Obama Romney, which was like off by 3 percent.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  If they're off in Trump's favor by 2 percent, he's going to win in the electoral college.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  Like he said that days before the election. They were off by 2 percent.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  Yeah. So it was within that cone of a problem.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  The final polls nationwide had her up 3 percent and she wound up winning the popular vote by 1 percent, which is not please don't email me.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  I know I'm not arguing. That means she should be president. I know the rules.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  The idea, though, is that if a candidate, especially a Democrat, only wins because of the Electoral College,
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  only wins the popular vote by 1 percent, that there is a very high probability that the Republican candidate will win the Electoral College and that is exactly will happen.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  Yes. And this year, in 2012, Silver said that that it was actually in Obama's favor the way the states were stacking up.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  He could have lost the popular vote by half a percent or something and he would have won the electoral.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  But for this election, the way it's stacked up, that that and they factored in like four weeks before you can go back and look,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  they had like an 8, 10, 12 percent chance that Trump would lose the popular vote and win the Electoral College.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  And so, like, you know, probabilities are hard. It's hard for people to understand them.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  The New York Times had that field goal the whole time.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  That was one of my thoughts on election night was like, I guess you missed the field goal.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  It's a 30 any NFL fan when they say her chances are like making a 38 yard yard field goal in the NFL.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000]  It's like, you know what? People miss it. 38 yard field goals all the time. Ask Buffalo Bills fans.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  Yeah, yeah, it happened. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:24.000]  It is one of our best friends of the show. It's Harry's. Harry's makes shaving products.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  They make them themselves. They're terrific. Big razor companies.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  I'm not going to name names. I'm not going to name the Gillette chick.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  They have this annoying habit of putting out new models, you know, the Mach seven, whatever the hell they call the new thing.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  And what they do every time they put out a new model is they raise their already high prices.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Unlike those guys, Harry's doesn't want to upcharged. They're going for low prices.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  That's why they made their razors even better.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  They have just upgraded their whole line of razors and handles and they're keeping the prices exactly the same.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  They're not just putting in a new line to make you feel like, well, now I spend more to get more.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  Now you pay the same prices that they already had, which were already lower than the national big brands.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  And they've improved everything. There are five blade razors now include softer flex hinge for a more comfortable glide.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  They now include a trimmer blade for hard to reach places, which I think for most men at least is like that little area right under your nose.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  A lubricating strip and a textured handle for more control when it's wet.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  They sent me one and I have to say, I love my old one. I've had it for years.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  I mean, I've had it since Harry started sponsoring my show, which was like, I think around 20 years ago, it feels like.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  And when I put the old one away, here's the thing. It still looks brand new, which is bizarre.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  Their stuff is built to last. But the new one, the textured handle, it's clearly better.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  Instant upgrade. No problem.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  And it's still just two bucks per blade compared to four dollars or more that you'll pay at the drugstore for brands like Gillette.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  They own their own factory in Germany where they make blades. They don't just buy like cut rate blades on some kind of open market and then just slap a Harry's label on them.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  They have their own razor blade factory in Germany where they make these blades and then they can keep the prices low because they sell them direct to you.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  They'll send you their popular free trial set, which comes with a razor five blade cartridge and shaving gel.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000]  It's free when you sign up for a shave plan. All you do is pay shipping.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  Plus, there's a special offer for fans of the talk show. Get a bottle of Harry's post shave bomb added to your order for free when you visit Harry's dot com and use the code talk show.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  No, the just talk show at checkout. You will get a free bottle of their post shave bomb. It's good stuff. Smells good. Feels good. I've got it.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  It's really, really nice stuff. So go to Harry's dot com right now and use talk show at checkout to claim your free trial set and post shave bomb, which is better than the deal you get from most other podcasts.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  So remember that that's Harry's dot com code talk show.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  You talked about the control strip before we move on to other things, but do you remember? I mean, this is the stupidest question I'm ever going to ask. Do you remember the control strip classic Mac OS?
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  Do I remember the control strip? Yeah, I actually booted up a, uh, an emulator the other day to look at it to just remind myself. But God, I had that on my power book.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  I don't know if you remember, like CPU Connectix power book utilities, which, like, added items to the control strip. Oh, I loved it. Yes. Yeah, totally.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  I mean, that was that was that was like the doc of its day to put it in context to people who are modern Mac users.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  But to me, it was better. It was one of the things I mean, famously or maybe not famously because I was maybe more obscure.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  But the first like three, four years at Daring Fireball is mostly me bitching about Mac OS 10 in the ways that the interface is not as good as the classic Mac OS.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  And control strip is one of those things where it was so perfectly Mac like every pixel of it was perfectly of the way that things were supposed to look in that OS and just everything.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  The close button, the little the little zipper thing that you would just tap to make it expand and contract that just everything about it was so nice and it was so elegant.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  And it felt so right for the Mac system wide that you just have this little thing and then you eventually you could drag it around to any corner that have to be in a corner.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  I think it had to be in a corner, right? No, it could be it could be anywhere on either side, anywhere along the left or right.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  And you'd zip it open and you'd get all these little icons and they opened it up to third parties and third parties did some really useful stuff.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  And like the Mac equivalent Mac OS 10 equivalent of it is all these little turd icons in the top right of our menu bar toolbar or the menu bar in the menu bar.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  We've still got them all those in the old Mac OS that those would all be control strip items and your menu bar would only have menus and then anything else would be in a control strip, which was really nice.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  It bothers me to no end 15 years later that we had something so elegant as the control strip and now we've put all these turds in our menu bars.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  I wonder if bartender, does bartender let you put their bar anywhere? I wonder about that.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Because bartender is kind of like that where you can actually pull things out of the menu bar and put them in the little bartender bar.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  And I wonder if you can, I think you can move it around.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  Hmm, I should look at that. I looked at bartender, I remember looking at it years ago and for some reason rejected it, but maybe I should take another look.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of hacky, although it's got some things going for it.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  I use it to clean up my menu bar because there's some items that I don't need to see most of the time, but I occasionally need to get to it.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  It's in the ballpark, right? And the idea there is, could you imagine pulling all of the stuff off the menu bar and putting it in this little bar that you dock somewhere else or you pop up somewhere else?
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  And yeah, we just, I think the answer is screen real estate is that the control strip was designed to be very small when collapsed and then you'd pop it open to get to the UI and it floated above everything.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  And then you'd turn off Apple talk or do whatever you need to do or connect via PPP to the internet and dial in with your modem.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  And then you snap it closed and it just is this little tiny thing in the corner and then you're done.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  And now we've got these huge monitors and they just littered with menu bar items on the top.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  But yeah, control strip was great. It was an unsung hero of the sort of latter day classic Mac OS.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  Yeah, it really was. And I'm so, I think it started on laptops too. And that was so popular. They, they brought it to the desktop, to every computer, even though it started on PowerBooks.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  I haven't, I wish that I'd asked while I was talking to people from Apple, but I can't help but think that they named the new thing, the control strip, that it's not a coincidence that it's, you know, built by people who remember the old one.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  Because it's so similar in concept, the way it zips open from the side.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  I mentioned it to them. I was like, oh, that's a familiar name. And they're like, yeah, we knew, we knew, you know, some of you guys would notice that we reuse the name and you know, it's, it's, uh, it's a cute reference.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  Like, I think that's what they were going for was those in the know, you know, Apple's aware of all these things that it has the intellectual property and the trademark for, and that was a name that they had and it was doing a similar job.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  And so they used it.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Yeah. And it just has similar character, you know, just the way that it animates.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  Ah, it's so nice.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  Anything else on the MacBook Pros? I have one, I guess, broad topic about it, but anything you want to talk about with the new MacBook Pros?
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  I don't know. I mean, it's the other big thing about them. Well, I mean, we mentioned Touch Bar, we mentioned Touch ID.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  The other big thing about them is the ports and I feel sort of talked out about it cause we've been talking about it since the MacBook came out a year ago and almost two years ago now.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  And certainly in the last month since the Apple event and I'm kind of over it.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  Like it's a port transition. It stinks. Everybody knows it stinks. Everybody buys adapters.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Uh, there's a period where everybody's got the adapters and has old hardware and then eventually it goes away.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  And I think USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 is like a good direction to go.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  And the only way you get there is by going through a transition. So here we are.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  And, you know, I don't know if, I'm kind of drained of outrage for something like that because I do think it's superior in almost every way.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Every time I try to plug something into the back of my iMac and get the USB orientation wrong and have to flip it over and peer into the port to make sure that I'm doing it right.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  I think, well, USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 solve this. This is dumb.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  And so, you know, I get people complaining about it and they're right to complain about it.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  But at the same time, I feel like in the long run, it's going to be great.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  And I'm going to miss MagSafe. I will.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  But at the same time, I think it's also cool that you can, on the touch bar models, you can plug in your Mac on either side.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  That is great. That is so great. It's so many.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  There are so many times where it's the worst is when you're far enough away from the power where it would fit to the right, but not the left.
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  It's just at the end. But then there's just other times where you just don't want to have to drape it around the outside where it just is inelegant.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Like, I mean, one case for me as an East coaster is sometimes if you're on the Acela on the East Coast train, the Amtrak Acela,
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  you can get there's some really cool seats that have a table in between them, but you're facing people on the other side.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  And the tables are relatively, as you might expect, it's not a very wide table.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  You know, you're pretty close, but you have enough space where two people back to back can, you know, put their laptops, you know, fairly, you know, easily.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  But if you want to stretch the power around the other side, it's, you know, you can do it, but it would be so much easier if you could always just plug it in on the side closest to the wall.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  Yeah. Yeah. So it's, again, I get people's complaints about it.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  Maybe I'm just a little jaded because I've seen it all before. It's like, yes, everybody will complain. Yes, it will be a pain. Yes, we will need adapters.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Then we'll get over it. And then in a few years, we'll look back and think, wow, I can't believe that we used that stuff. This stuff is so much better.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  I linked to a couple of examples from like the four years ago MacBook Pros, and they, it was so uncanny how the almost word for word, you didn't even have to like edit out like, you know, one, you know, the name of the port.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  They would just be like, you know, not enough ports to thin on, you know, they're exactly word for word.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  People are saying about these. I also believe I've written about this, too, but I believe firmly that Apple's aggressive traditional, not just in this case with the going all USB C Thunderbolt three, but they've you know, that they've done this so many times in the past that it it brings about the future where being all USB C is fine.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Sooner than if they had stuck a couple of legacy ports on on the devices if they'd put it, you know, old school USB and one old Thunderbolt or something like that.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  In I firmly I can't prove it. There is no way to prove it without the ability to fork the universe, you know, but in the alternate universe where these new MacBook Pros have like a USB port and a Thunderbolt port.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  I don't know what other ports people still wish they had, but all right SD card reader or something like that.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  I really believe that two or three years ago, it's less of a it's less of a USB C everywhere world.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  Oh, sure. I mean, I think it's only a matter of degrees because you I think you made this point on daring fireball, which is if you have legacy ports, you have no motivation to switch because you can just keep using your legacy ports.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  But once you've switched and you have no more of the old ports, then there's no longer any point in buying anything using the old ports and you move to the new ports and that and then you move on and and the longer you leave the bridge and Apple's done that in the past where they've left the bridges and they've done it where they rip the band-aid off and I this time they decided to rip the band-aid off and I'm I'm okay with it.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  I in fact the people that I I have the most sympathy for are probably like photographers and videographers who use that SD card slot and I totally get why it is a pain to have to go from having no reader to having a reader as somebody who used an 11 inch air.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  I didn't have a slide. I already I already felt that pain but I get it. I totally get that's I get that one too. I do get it and it speaks to how useful the S the built-in SD slot is to serious photographers that Apple did it ever in the first place because it's the least appley thing that they've done in a long time.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  It is it's like since they put S video on the Macintosh TV. Yeah, it's like why is this port here? Right? It has to be if it's so really it's it the SD card slot on Macs is the return of the floppy drive.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  I mean, it's way, you know, you know thousands of times faster and thousands of you know times more storage but it's you know, it's the floppy drive is least appley thing. I know so it's the fact that it's so useful is the reason they did it in the first place.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  But the fact that they removed it is the reason why you know Apple was the first company to remove the floppy drive.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  Right. Although I mean, I just bought for experimenting for like podcasting stuff. I bought an SD card that does Wi-Fi. It's not the iFi. It's a it's a Toshiba. I think one and it's pretty good.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  You know, it's again not perfect but I can see Apple's philosophy here too of saying, you know, you can get a card reader and then there are also new wireless technologies in in the SD cards in the cameras.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  You know, there are other ways to transfer this stuff or you bring a cable and attach your camera direct, you know, it's not but I get it. I like I get why why that's a bit major inconvenience because that was their, you know, their storage medium of choice and it had a reader built in now it's gone. I totally get it.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  That said, though, there's still a fair number. I realize SD is the most popular size, but there's still a fair number of people shooting on cannons that shoot the CF card.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  And there's other cameras that that use the super micro almost like SIM card size SD card, right? The super tiny one. Yeah. And then with them, you have to bring and adapt, you know, usually it's I think most people probably use there's SD standard SD card size adapters that you slide it in and then you put it in.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  So you're still, you know, it wasn't an ideal world. And I feel like the world where everything just works wirelessly and you can very, very quickly airdrop things equivalent of airdrop, whether it's actually official airdrop or not, but just, you know, plop a thing from your standalone camera to your MacBook.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  It's going to come quicker now that the SD card is not in Macintoshes.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Yeah, I think that's true, but I think I think maybe there'll be a little longer of a pain. The pain transition will be a little different there than for like USB stuff.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  But I just think back to like, you know, the iMac throw out serial ADB and SCSI all in one throw for USB. And this is this is a little bit like that.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  I guess the last thing I want to talk about is the the people arguing that these aren't pro devices that okay, they're nice. It's nice enough, but it's not a pro device because it's not the fastest Intel mobile chipset.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  It's not the one that I don't want to get into the details, but Apple wants to use the low energy RAM and use it by wanting to use the low energy RAM. They're limited to 16 gigabytes right now.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:53.000]  That's going to change soon enough. I would bet in 2017 there will be an update to the MacBook Pros that support at least 32 gigabytes of RAM.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  I don't know if it could go to 64, but it would be at least 32. But there's people who would want just to name one thing that they would rather have Apple build, at least as an option, another level of MacBook Pro that say has a better graphics card,
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  higher energy RAM that would support up to 32 or more gigabytes of RAM, even if it takes more energy, and would rather have a significant hit on battery life, but a performance improvement.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  And they'll just plug it in or get less battery life. Why won't Apple build that machine and let them buy it?
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Yeah, and I get that. Although I think if you're Apple, you know what the sweet spot of your market is, and you know who's buying these things. And again, it sucks if you are the person who's in the corner of the market that is small, but you're in it, so it's super important to you.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  And Apple looks at it and goes, are we really going to solve, are we going to build one reference sort of design for the MacBook Pro, and it's going to cater to 2% of our market or 4% of our market?
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  Are we really going to do that? And the customer, not everybody needs to be targeted. The customer is not always right. Not everybody needs to be targeted.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  And that stinks if you're in that area where Apple's like, look, you're just going to have to suffer because we're not going to build this product.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  We would have to make major changes in order to build this product so that it would also overlap your needs. So I get that.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  I also think, though, Apple knows about the march of time and the march of technology, and as in so many of these Apple product designs, they're kind of looking ahead.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  And maybe some of that is that they expected more from Intel than not. Maybe that's true.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  I can't help but think that's true a little. I do.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I have this, you talk about next year, it's like, yeah, you'd think Apple would use its influence with Intel maybe to say, how about a 32 gig ceiling next time, right?
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  Can you work on that? Because we really could use that. But in this same enclosure, with the same power profile and all of that, next year's stuff is going to be able to do way more than this year's stuff.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  And the year after that, because this model will probably be the same one that we see in terms of the shape of it and the touch bar and all of that.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  This is probably also the 2018 MacBook Pro and the 2019 MacBook Pro, honestly.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  And every year, they're going to have more capabilities fitting in this small case.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  So this is the year where it's kind of a tough ask, and next year it'll be better.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  And that, again, stinks if you're not in there now and you need a laptop now. I have no arguments for you. Yeah, that's terrible. I get it.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  Right. I think, you know, you have to think, I keep thinking about it from like a marketing perspective.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  Product marketing perspective is that Apple has three slots for MacBooks, for families of MacBooks.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  And they, you know, there are gradients that blend between them at price points, you know, where there's like $100, every $100 from like $999 up to, you know, $4,000 almost.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  You know, there's configurations that you can buy.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  But fundamentally, there's the MacBook cheap. In other words, price is your biggest concern.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  And that is the MacBook Air. And it has been for the last few years.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  The entire reason the MacBook Air is still being sold is to hit the $999 starting price point.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  Right. It's like the old plastic MacBook was back in the day before it got eclipsed by the MacBook Air.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  You know what? I forgot about this. The last time you were on the show, the last time you were on the show back in August, we were talking about MacBooks, speculating about what we're now talking about in hindsight.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  And you had said something about the MacBook Pro being the best-selling Mac.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Yeah. And everybody said, no, no, no, it's the Air. Because the price is so good.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  Right. And me and you are thinking too much about people like us.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  And really, I heard from a couple of people who work in Apple retail stores.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  And they're like, you just cannot even believe how many people when they come in to get a new Mac.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  And they say, because dealing with them.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  And, you know, these Apple, the people who work in those sorts of areas, it's very clear that these people just, you know, they want to get a Mac.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  They're definitely, you know, you can tell they're going to buy one, but they're not definitely, there's no doubt they're going to get the Air.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  It's just a question of which one, because, you know, about $100 is the most more they're going to spend.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  And it's all about price. And I'm a Mac, I'm a MacBook Air user.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  Right. I haven't used a MacBook Pro in years.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  For me, I think I was too busy focusing on like the flagship and the one that's got the probably the biggest profit margin.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Right. Right. But that's not the same as I mean, and that's why that $999 13 inch non retina Air is still there.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Right. Because that is that is priced to move.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  And that's the price that gets you into a Mac laptop.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  And it's a pretty you know what? It's a pretty good system.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  It's pretty it's a pretty good mix of power and price.
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  It really is even to this day.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  People who are thinking of the old PC industry in a way that everything every six to eight months, you know, just put new chips and everything would get faster.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  And you'd always be, you know, swapping out in a way that the MacBook Air is effectively unchanged and the price is unchanged.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  The price isn't going down. They're keeping it at $999.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  It's it's because people keep buying them. It is a best selling device and they don't mind that people don't mind.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  It's fast enough for them. So, you know, you could say that Apple is under like some kind of moral obligation to, you know, cut the price or, you know.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  But it's, you know, business wise, you know, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  It's a very popular device and it exists just to hit that price point.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  Then there's the MacBook Pro, which is right now it's the same size.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  There's no argument in size or weight between a 13 inch MacBook Pro and a MacBook Air.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  It is just the you know, if you want to say pro, it's really, you know, like I emphasize the word nice in my review.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  It's the MacBook nice and are the MacBook premium, if you want to call it.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  It is, you know, it's in every single regard.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  It is nicer, faster, has the retina screen, and now it has a super bright retina screen.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  And then in between is the MacBook Thin and Light, which, you know, that's what now is called the MacBook.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Ten years ago or eight years ago, it was the MacBook Air.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  And you still pay a premium for the thinness and lightness and the niceness.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  And it has a retina screen. And it just it's it's just sexy, right?
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  I mean, there's just it is like the little convertible sports car, right?
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  It is really, really I was in a meeting. I'm on this panel at Drexel University that meets like once a year, like alumni advisors in this thing.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  And it would be at a meet. I don't go to meetings very often.
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  We just had a meeting and there was a guy who had the the you know, the current MacBook.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  And all I could think is, God damn, that is a nice that is a nice looking laptop.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  I don't it's not really for me. Right. But it's like, you know, and I think he's you know, he's just typing emails on it.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  And it's like, wow, that is a nice thing to carry around. Is there room for something else?
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  Like that would be this isn't my proposed marketing name, but the the MacBook Max or the MacBook.
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  The power, the power MacBook Pro or, you know, whatever you want to call it,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  something that trades battery life and maybe some thinness and weight for sheer computing power.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  Well, it's the equivalent. I mean, it's a slot that they haven't had for a little while.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  Because if you think about the yeah, the air is like the plastic MacBook and the MacBook is where the air used to be.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  MacBook Pro is still sort of where it was. And in terms of 13 and 15.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:42.000]  And then there's this lot that used to be like the the lunch tray, right? The cafeteria for the 17 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  And they just don't make that computer anymore. But, you know, and I think this is a lot of the pro fear about Apple is that laptop doesn't exist.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  And the Mac Pro basically doesn't exist because it's been abandoned since it was released three years ago.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  And so here here we are. Like, what is this? What does this all mean?
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Does Apple care about that that market enough to make a product for it?
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  Or do pros have to kind of eke out their livelihood on computers that were not really made for them?
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Because that's the best that Apple wants, not can offer, wants to offer, is willing to offer.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  And I don't know. I mean, they totally could.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  I'm a little surprised that they didn't take the old MacBook Pro and stuff something even more powerful in there in the old enclosure and just say,
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  look, and we've got this thing that's got old ports and it's got it's got the latest Intel processors and the latest GPU and go to and no touch bar.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  And just it's also available. You can max it out. You can load it up with stuff.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  And if you really need it, you can you can take I sympathize and I'm hearing from readers and listeners and I see it and I believe I believe them.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  I don't think it's like an idle threat, but I'm hearing from people saying, I think I have to switch back to Windows, you know,
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  because I need to be able to buy something and it's clear Apple isn't going to make it for me.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  And that is the advantage of it's always been the advantage of the PC marketplace is that you.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  Well, Apple's whole Apple has holes in its lineup.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  And right now, its whole is a notebook that is optimized for let's just say, well, I was going to say power.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  But that sounds like it might be energy performance, sheer performance.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  The most RAM and the fastest chips and the fastest graphics. They don't have that.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  They don't sell it. And there are PC laptops that have, you know, the fastest Intel CPUs and incredibly fast, hot GPUs.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  And, you know, they just, you know, sacrifice battery life and wait for that. Apple doesn't fill that.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  The hole in the PC market is, in my opinion, niceness. There's nothing you can buy on the PC market that's as nice as a MacBook Pro.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  Obviously, that's subjective. Obviously, the difference in that and it drives some people nuts is you can measure performance.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  You can run a benchmark and come up with a number.
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  There's no benchmark for how nice the machine is and how much I appreciate the new hinge when I lift open the thing.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  But I feel it in my gut and I believe it. That's what you give up.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  It's a shame that there are people who love Maco Macos 10, love the Mac.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  But have that their personal needs are such that they want that machine because I don't think Apple's going to make it.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Right. And I think, yeah, and it's so easy to come across as not having sympathy for them or not caring about them.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  And that's not how I feel at all. But if you're Apple, you have to make a calculation about, you know, first off, there's all the things about what's the product.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  If they went down this path and then realized that it was going to limit them to 16 gigs of RAM and they're like,
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  well, you know, we thought Intel would come through with something different, but they didn't.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  Maybe that happened or maybe they didn't. They decided 16 was good enough for almost all cases.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  What is the number of people for whom the highest end Mac laptop is simply not sufficient?
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  What is that number? What's the size of that market and who are those people and are they influential and all that?
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  Can they wait a year? Yeah. And so you ask that. And yeah.
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  Do they have to buy something right now or can they wait a year for something that will be, you know, the better, more efficient, more powerful in the same space?
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  And that's for me, that's the question. Like if Apple, I'm sure Apple has done that calculation.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  We know that Apple has very smart product marketing and research people and they look at this stuff and they've got access to data that we don't because they are Apple.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  And my guess is, because these are the decisions they made, that they looked at that and said that market is not sufficiently large enough.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  The market we're cutting off by making these decisions is not sufficiently large enough for us to not make these decisions.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:55.000]  So we're going to do it. And maybe they're right and maybe they're wrong, right? Maybe they're wrong.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  But if they're right, it doesn't change the fact that there are lots of people, potentially, just not enough in that space who are going to feel like Apple has abandoned them.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  And you know what? Apple has abandoned them. Apple has said, look, if you need 32 gigs of RAM in your laptop and this kind of, you know, like I'm in the Relay FM Slack and Shahid Kamal Ahmad is in there and he's a game developer.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  And I think he's going to buy one of these because he's also a Mac fan, but like he's doing Windows development now.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  And he looks at this and Brianna Wu is like this, too. You know, she knows about game development stuff.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  And they're like, you know, for 3D and VR and stuff like that, this hardware is kind of not good enough.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  And for gaming, it's certainly not good enough. But Apple has made that decision for years now of like, we don't care if it's not good enough for gaming.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  We don't optimize for gaming. So I guess what I'm saying is, it could be that Apple's miscalculated here.
[01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:01.000]  But it could also be that what we're hearing is the people who are basically being told by Apple, we're not going to make a computer that will satisfy you.
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000]  And Apple's not wrong to make that decision necessarily. And they're definitely not wrong to be angry about it.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:15.000]  But it's not a sign that this was a misfire, that some people are going to buy a PC because Apple can't satisfy them.
[02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  I think that it's also the case that Apple designs to eliminate, makes choices for their customers because they truly believe that they know better.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  And they want to keep customers from making a mistake. By which I mean, let's say you go into the Apple store and you've got the money to spend.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:47.000]  And you want to buy the best MacBook Pro that you can get or the best MacBook, let's say, in case they had a different name like the MacBook Plus or whatever.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Obviously, there are some truly expert users, game developers, like you said, people who really do know exactly.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Yes, I don't care if I only get five hours of battery life instead of 10. I want the machine that has this power.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  I think Apple knows that there's other people who would come in and say, well, if this machine is $2,500 and this other machine is $2,500 and thicker and heavier,
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  but look at the specs. It's got more gigahertz. It's got more RAM. That's clearly the better machine. I'll buy the one that's better.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  Or maybe it's more expensive, right? I don't know. But whatever, if it can be mistaken as being better in their mind, but it isn't for them.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  It's extra gigahertz they don't need. It's extra graphics that they don't need.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  It's battery life that they would appreciate if they had it, that it would be a mistake for them to walk out of that store.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  I think Apple, obviously, these MacBook Pros are not the best hypothetical MacBook Pros from November 2016 for every single person.
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  But I think what Apple is, I think it's restating what you said, what Apple has tried to do is make the best machines for the most people.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  And that keeps some of those people from buying the wrong, going the wrong way.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  Yeah. And it's not to come back to like when the customer, like myths we have about companies succeeding or failing based on keeping their customers happy.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  The truth is that it's not a you choose to make everybody happy or you choose to make some people unhappy.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  The truth is the choices you make are going to make somebody unhappy in most cases and you get to choose who you make unhappy.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  And Apple makes their choices and now we'll have to live with them and we'll see quite what happens.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  But if Apple views the decisions about battery and about weight and about size and says that 90 percent of our users care about that stuff
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  and one percent of our users care about this other thing, then I can see why they make that decision.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  And it doesn't make it any more bitter if you're somebody who's kind of on the outside looking in saying,
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  I'd really like more than 16 gigs of RAM in my laptop, please, or a better GPU.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  But it's an open question.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  Like Pro, like you said, it means nice.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  That's probably true.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  And the Mac Pro, it's the same question of like, does Apple, Apple as a company right now is making decisions about what their audience is for these various products?
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  Who are their customers?
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  And it may be that the Apple of five years ago would be like, oh, man, we got to give a high end, super high end developers and content creators
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  and people who used to use Linux and now use a Mac because they get the command line.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  We got to get those people because we got to use them in the Mac.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  You know, maybe the Apple of today is like, we're not interested in those people.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  We want a mass market of people.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  The MacBook Pro is nice, but it's not going to be for everyone.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  And that's their decision to make.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  And if they want to turn their back on certain markets, it might be a good business decision.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  And if I was in those markets, I would be pissed off.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  I think all these things are true.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  I don't think if people in a certain market switch to Windows or Linux, it means the MacBook Pro was a bad decision necessarily.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Because, you know, Apple, Apple will not be surprised if that happens, right?
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  It's not like these came out and Apple was like, what?
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  They only have 16 gigs of RAM.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  We're shocked, right?
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  They made that decision.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  They knew what the ramifications were going to be.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  And, you know, it's interesting if that's the case that a bunch of people maybe that they've kind of wooed over to the Mac over the last 15 years with OS X are now not in their target anymore.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  I will say, I just think, though, that, you know, again, things could change.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  You know, the past does not always predict the future.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  But if you look at the last 10 years of MacBook sales, you know, it has gone down a little bit in the last year, but I think that's mostly been people waiting, you know.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  But it's Apple's priorities, prioritizing thinness to an almost obsessive degree, prioritizing battery life to an almost obsessive degree.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  You know, and it really I come back to this many, many times that the order of your priorities matters tremendously.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  Even if you have like two, you know, the customer and the Apple have like the same top four priorities, you know, but they're in slightly different order.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  It makes a tremendous difference in the resulting product.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  And Apple's list order of priorities has shown to be very successful.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  Yeah, and that's the thing is Apple could be making a bad decision here.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  It's entirely possible that they're making a bad decision here, and we'll find out what the market says about it.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  But they have their priorities, and a lot of it is something that is just sort of like quintessentially Apple.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  And, you know, when we say they prioritize the battery, I mean, I think the right thing to say there is really like they prioritize the weight and the thinness.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  And the battery comes third where the battery has to hit some kind of a metric, but really no more than that.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  Every inch, every minute, every hour of battery life above what they think is optimal is added weight and thickness that you don't get.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  You get enough battery to hit, like with the iPad, it's whatever, 10 hours, and that's it.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000]  You don't get any more battery.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  And with the MacBook, it's a little more complicated, you know, because it's battery life and power saving in the operating system and all of those things, but, you know, that's their priority.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  So they're going to put thinness and lightness and battery life and power in maybe that sequence where somebody else would put power first.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  I'm generalizing, but to my gut feeling, in the early years of that inflection point where the most Macs sold were laptops and notebooks, I should say.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000]  Apple calls them notebooks instead of laptops, but notebooks instead of desktops, right?
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  There was that, you know, and it used to be because notebook computers were so phenomenally expensive that it was really a luxury item just to have like the lowest end power.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  And at the inflection point where they became the most popular Macs, I felt for years it was very consistent where Apple would say you could get six hours of battery life.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  And in the real world, it always got, you seem to get about three and a half or four hours, like, but Apple would say six.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  And it was always, you know, it seemed to me like it was for me flying coast to coast, you know, five, six hour flights.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  It never seemed to be enough to go on a full charge coast to coast.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  It was right, you know, in real use.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  And that's before they had Wi-Fi. And then there was, you know, at some point when they hit, you know, I think the Intel transition definitely had something to do with it.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  All of a sudden, the battery life did start creeping up.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  And it seemed like that was a higher priority for Apple on an annual basis where it really was suddenly getting six hours of battery life.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  And you really could get seven hours, eight hours.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  And it seems like once they hit 10, they were like, we're done, you know, and now, you know, that will hold that point steady.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  And, you know, and I know that the 10 isn't necessarily 10 for all tasks, but 10 under their, you know, testing conditions.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000]  Yeah, they're light, light use 10 hours, right?
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  Because if you if you really are doing editing audio or video or something like that, it will it will bleed that thing dry way faster than that.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  And that's that's just how it is.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  That's that's not what they're shooting for.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  All right. Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor long another long.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000]  This is like a greatest hits of daring of talk show sponsors.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  Backblaze Backblaze is unlimited native backup for Mac and PC.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  Here's what you do. You go to backblaze dot com slash during Fireball.
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  You download Backblaze to your Mac, install it on your Mac.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  It's a simple little it goes in your system preferences. It's just a system preferences thing.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  And then it just starts you sign up again, no credit card.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  And then it just starts backing up everything on your Mac to their their secure cloud based servers.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  Everything. Do you have an external drive that's maybe like three terabytes or something like that?
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  It'll back it up to have two external drives. It'll back them both up.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  It might take a while, depending on how much you have, but you don't pay more for more space.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  It's just five bucks a month for unlimited, unthrottled offsite backup per Mac.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  Five bucks a month. That's it. I've been using them for years.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  I've recommended them for years. They have so many features that it's everything you might want them to do.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  They can do. Let's say you need a restoration of everything you've got.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000]  Well, if you want to, though, they can restore by mail. You can purchase a hard drive with all your day overnight,
[02:09:53.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  all your data on it, and they'll overnight it to you on FedEx, because let's face it, downloading three terabytes of stuff or however much stuff could take forever.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.000]  Maybe, you know, in some kind of emergency situation where you need it all, you can get it overnighted.
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  You can use like their iOS app and log in and just get one file and email it to somebody.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:24.000]  You can just access all the files on your Mac backed up through backplace.
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  So anything from one file to getting everything on your Mac overnighted to you on a hard drive, they can do.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  They have over 200 petabytes of data that has been stored by backplace.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  Over 10 billion files have been restored to their customers.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  It is a great addition to local backups, like having an external drive running time machine or I use super duper to clone my startup drive every day or two.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  A great utility.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  Having an offsite backup that runs automatically, just silently and visibly in the background, just software that never gets in the way.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  It's not like all of a sudden when backplace starts backing up your stuff, you know, the fans spin up.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  You don't even notice. I never notice. It just happens.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  I can't say what a relief it is to know that if somebody came in and robbed my house or if the house burned down or something like that, that I don't lose my data.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  For years and years and years, that's how I lived, and it was always a nagging fear in the back of my head that, hey, if something really bad happened, I could lose everything, and that would be kind of heartbreaking.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  What a relief it is. It's a great service. I use it myself.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball so they know where you came from.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Really, it's a great deal.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:55.000]  Last thing on my agenda, we've been going long, is just speaking of books from Apple.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  Yes, the lowest-priced MacBook.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  The lowest-priced MacBook from Apple is a coffee table book that they announced yesterday, I think it was yesterday, called Designed by Apple in California.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  It comes in two sizes, small and large. They cost $200 and $300, respectively, and it's almost entirely photographs of 20 years of Apple products.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  I don't know. I have mixed feelings about it. I'm not as outraged as some people seem to be. I don't think it's as much of a boondoggle as some people think it should be.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:45.000]  I do think, though, that the optics of it are a little self-indulgent.
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  Mm-hmm. No doubt. I mean, it's self-published, right?
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  You made the point on Daring Fireball. Expensive art books are a thing, right?
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  People who are used to thinking books cost $10 or $20 do not know about expensive art books.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  You mentioned you bought some very expensive, you know, art books, Stanley Kubrick, lots of books like that.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  There's a book called Iconic about Apple industrial design that's $100, but they've got a $250 special edition.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  So, I mean, it's sort of a thing, but you're right, it's a little surprising. They published it themselves, they didn't work with a partner.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  I still feel like this is the ultimate Rorschach test for people's view of where Apple is today.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  Like, I'm not quite sure commenting on this tells us anything about actually,
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  especially since they claim that they've been working on this for eight years and they decided to build an archive
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  and had to buy some of their products on eBay in order to get them back because they literally didn't have them in the office.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  So, I'm not sure this says a lot about like where Apple is today versus a progression of their design group for the last eight years.
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  But I think it is a vessel into which everybody can pour all of their fears about where Apple is going and use this as an example if they want to.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  I had a part from my write-up on it that I wrote and then I thought about and I deleted it.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  It's the sort of thing that I just, because I can explain it on the podcast why I deleted it,
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  I feel like I can say it on a podcast with no reservations, but I felt extremely uncomfortable publishing it, which was something to the effect of,
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000]  I don't have the exact words in front of me, I guess because I deleted them.
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  I'll come out and say it. I don't think this would have happened if Steve Jobs were still in charge of Apple.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  But I don't know Steve Jobs at all and Johnny Ive was by all accounts his closest colleague and one of his dearest friends.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  And so I feel like a fool saying that because I didn't know the guy and Johnny Ive knew him as well probably better than anybody who worked with him.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  And so for all I know, Ive and Jobs kicked around the idea while Jobs was still alive and I'm an idiot.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  But it feels to me like something they wouldn't have done with Steve Jobs.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000]  That Apple has made a book that Steve Jobs never would have published dedicated to Steve Jobs.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  Yeah, I mean one of the problems with the had geography of somebody like Steve Jobs where we turn him into this figure,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  this amazing kind of icon is that he was a person and his life was a continuum, right?
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  And so I think I saw somebody make the comment that I thought was really smart that said it's undoubtedly true that Steve Jobs of 1997 through 2002, whatever, 2005 would not approve of this, right?
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  I feel like there was a pathological almost dislike of the past when Apple was trying to get on its feet again.
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  And I think some of that might have been innate in Steve Jobs.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  I think some of that was also a management technique that he felt like Apple was so navel-gazing and so focused on congratulating itself on its great achievements of the past that it had completely lost its way.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000]  And when he came back, he wanted to right the ship.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  So I think it's entirely possible that in the last five years that Steve Jobs was at Apple that his feelings were different and that in talking to Jonny Ive about the idea that they didn't even have an archive and that that was a mistake and they didn't even have some of the products they designed.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:59.000]  And that when they set up, I mean, you could make the same argument for something like Apple University. Like, is that too inward-facing or is the argument there that you want to be able to document and teach your company's successes and thought processes so that the culture can pervade all of your employees and that other parts of the company can learn from what these parts of the company had to experience themselves instead of having to learn it again?
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  I mean, you could make the argument that that's all of a whole and that that's as much what this is about as anything else.
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:25.000]  Or you could just look at it and say this is self-congratulatory nonsense and it's a project where Jonny Ive got to hire a famous, fabulous photographer to take beauty shots of all the things that he made so that he has got a souvenir when he leaves Apple.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  Also, you made the point on during follow that I thought was really good. Like in another time, this would either be like an Apple employee only thing or I was thinking or they'd print a thousand copies and make them available only at the infinite loop company store.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  And today's Apple is like, yeah, we might as well sell them everywhere.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  It didn't occur to me. I actually cheated a little bit when I put that hypothetical out there. I actually heard about this from somebody a while back, not super recently, which is why I didn't think of it early in the morning yesterday and it only occurred to me at night.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:12.000]  I heard something about this project a while ago from someone at Apple and what I heard then was that it was being made for Apple employees, that my hypothetical was at one point maybe the plan.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  And I think in that world where Apple made this exact book and made it or maybe since it's Apple sold it to Apple employees in that world, I think these books would be going for over a thousand dollars, maybe fifteen hundred dollars on eBay.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:48.000]  Yep. And I think I would strongly Adam ink for ink, paper for paper, the exact same book. I think that if Apple made them exclusive to Apple employees, they would be selling for maybe two thousand dollars on eBay until the market calmed down.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  Well sure. I think that's the argument for why you sell it to anyone is why create a scarcity that means that somebody else makes an eight hundred dollar profit on this thing that you made?
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  That's like selling a World Series ticket for two hundred and fifty dollars face value knowing that it will immediately be resold on eBay for a thousand dollars. It's like why would you let somebody else take that money?
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  With printing books, they can not print as many as they want, but they can probably because of the price, print as many as it needs to meet demand.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  And in a way that like with Hamilton tickets, they can't make the theater bigger. And even if they could make it bigger, the seats wouldn't be good. You can't have Hamilton in an NBA sized arena. It's not the same experience.
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:48.000]  Right. And those actors can only do seven shows a week. That's all they can do. Or eight shows a week, however much it is. That's all they can do. Two matinees, six night performances and they've got to sleep.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  The scale is limited very quickly. And so the fact that the tickets on the secondhand market are selling at exorbitant prices, well that's the way supply and demand works when supply has a hard upper limit.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:15.000]  Right. So the alternative is if you're Hamilton, the alternative is you either build in a no resellers. You can return it to the theater for your money back, but you don't get to resell it.
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:23.000]  Or you raise the price. Or you just accept that somebody else is going to make twice as much as you make on your product.
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  And you know, Apple's so big and there's so many people who are interested in it that it totally makes sense for them to say, why would we make this and not let anybody who wants one get one? Why would we do that?
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:46.000]  So the more I think about it, the more okay I am with it. I still think the optics are bad because there's a lot of people who complain, but I think it's better than anything else they could have done, including not make the book.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  Like, I mean, I'm going to buy one. Are you?
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  I don't know.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  I don't know. I might get the small one, but I want one. But I'm a sucker for coffee table books. I am. I have a weak spot for them. I own Iconic. I have all those Tashian ones about Kubrick that were absolutely gut-wrenchingly expensive.
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  Yeah.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  I'm a sucker for them.
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  It's a thing. Yeah. And I think when you put it in that context of the big, oversized, expensive art book, it's not nearly as ridiculous unless you want to use it as an example of sort of a cultural change or a systemic failure at Apple, which gets us back to the Inglot test.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  You can absolutely use it as a vehicle for that if you want to, but I'm kind of with you. I'm okay with it. I think it's definitely not what Steve Jobs of 2004 would do, but he's gone and Johnny is there, and it might have been the Steve Jobs of 2009.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  The eight-year thing is an interesting thing. That came in Johnny Ive's interview with Wallpaper, and I put it in the show notes already.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  The eight-year quote, though, is ambiguous because people are taking it as evidence that Jobs approved of the book, but it's not. What he said started eight years ago was their collection of all old Apple equipment.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  They wanted to look at some of the old candy-colored IMAX, and they didn't have them all.
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:38.000]  But still, that goes to a point where Jobs was still around, and they were reversing his policy, which was don't think about the past. Can you imagine that Apple didn't have a Bondi Blue IMAX in their possession?
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  But for that era, sure. It is proof that Jobs changed because when Jobs first came back to Apple in 1996, I guess it was 1997, one of the first things he did is he found that they had a whole collection of all this old archive.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  He's just like, let's get rid of it. And they didn't throw it in a dumpster. They gave it to a museum.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  That's my favorite Jobs quote ever.
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  It was, I said, get it away, and we sent that shit to Stanford. I just love the whole thing. I love the swearing. I love the get it away. It's got cooties.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  It was repellent to him that this company that was going into the dumps had this whole thing that was like a monument to its greatness.
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  And so that was his reflexive, you know, get it away. And they sent it to Stanford, and that was it.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:39.000]  Which brings me to, and to me this is the Rorschach test, is a sentiment I've seen several people supported on Twitter.
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  Best put by genius, like jailbreak sort of developer Stephen Troughton Smith. His take on Twitter was that it's only the last 20 years says a lot.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  This is Ive's portfolio, not Apple's. My impression is that his career is drawing to a close.
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  And a lot of people, this isn't just because of the book. I've seen people say that ever since the promotion to chief design officer and naming Alan Dye and I forget the other guy's name.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  As the hardware and software design chief under Ive. Is Johnny Ive checking out and slowly fading away?
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  Or is he, you know, I can see it two different ways. I honestly can see it. And I don't know. This is something that is sometimes knowledgeable about internal workings at Apple as I am.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  I don't know anybody who has insight to it. And I think part of it is because Johnny Ive operates in such an isolated way within the company that he doesn't really interact directly with a large number of people and never did.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  He's in a secure enclave.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  One thing I've heard, I have heard that he has lately been checked out of, not checked out, I guess, but not as directly involved with product design.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  And that he has been largely focused on architecture. Meaning mostly the, obviously the Spaceship Campus and the new stores.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  The new store design. Right. And maybe the other top level executive who's been working the most with Ive is Angela Arens.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  Right. I also wonder about the car, right? You know, for a while there, the talk was that they were going to make a car and they recalibrated that to making bits of a car.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  And I have to wonder if that was a little bit of a hit for Johnny Ive because he is a car guy. We know that. And perhaps one of the reasons they went down the path of making their own car is that Johnny Ive was excited about doing car design.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  And it sounds like they've made the decision to back away from that too. I think the idea that Ive has conquered all mountains.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  There are no more lands for him to conquer. And that he, you know, is easing his way out of Apple is, it certainly seems like a legitimate scenario.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  I don't, like you, I don't really have any evidence. I've heard people say that people inside Apple have that impression too.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  But it's not necessarily that they've got more information than we do about this too. But it certainly feels that way.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  Like he's either eased into a very different role or he's just sort of fading away. Absolutely, this book does feel like the Johnny Ive era dissertation kind of thing.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  Like, here it is. Here's the work that I did. And then you step away from that.
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  The other side of it, though, could be that he is the most influential person in the company. And that not...
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  He decreed that there would be a book. And so there's a book.
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  Exactly. Like in a way that Steve Jobs could decree a lot of things. You know, we're going to open Star Space Time, you know, the night before FaceTime came out.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  That Johnny Ive can say, we're going to make a book. And that means they're going to make a book whether other people object. Oh, here's my number one example.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  Can't believe it took me 30 seconds to think of it. Clearly, this is what happened. I don't know this. Nobody has ever told me this. Who knows?
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  But I would bet my bottom dollar on it. Johnny Ive said, I want to make a $20,000 gold Apple Watch.
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:43.000]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I do know for a fact that there were some high-level executives within Apple who thought that was nutty.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  I never heard for a fact that it was Johnny Ive himself who wanted it. But I know what I think. And I think it's Johnny Ive said, I've always wanted to make a watch.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  One of the great materials that watches are made out of is gold. So I want to make a gold Apple Watch.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  It's the least Apple-like product that has ever been made. Or at least, I shouldn't say Apple-like, but at least like any other Apple product that's ever been made.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  Right. It breaks your Coca-Cola analogy.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:33.000]  Exactly. And it is indulgent. I don't know. But it makes me think, I don't know that he, I think that maybe what's happened, possibly. I'm not saying that this is any, you know. Johnny Ive might be there for the next 15, 20 years, but that he has assumed a jobs-like role of gets to do whatever he wants and has final say over all products.
[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  But that his personality is such, and it's so different than Steve Jobs's, that he's almost a Howard Hughes-like figure. You know, a recluse. Other than appearing as a narrator in the product videos.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  I don't get, well, I don't get, you know, I don't know whether that's true or whether it really is just that he has stage fright and so he wants to be on video, but he does seem to have fallen into this role as their credibility, right?
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:17.000]  I mean, he's there. Those Johnny Ive videos went from, we want Johnny to explain things, but he's terrible on stage or he doesn't want to be on stage. Something like that, right?
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  And so we're going to make these videos and he's going to narrate them. But at some point that seems to, especially since Steve has been gone, that seems to have become instead like Johnny brings the credibility.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  Let us explain to you why what Apple does is making all, we're making all the right decisions and all the steps we had to go through and all the incredible processes that we now use in order to make this product, right?
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:59.000]  I feel like that's now his role is as this, in some ways, almost like an icon or a totem of like the Apple everybody believes is there where they have their, you know, where they do their amazing design and they make all these incredible decisions to bring the future out of his white room into reality.
[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:05.000]  And he may not, I mean, he may only be spiritual leadership at this point. I don't know.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  I firmly believe I really do like that when it comes to, uh, an aesthetic decision like, Hey, should we ship jet black in addition to regular black on these iPhone sevens?
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  You know, should we do, we can do, you know, here's what we, here's two blacks we can do. The jet black one is more expensive and time consuming.
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  And if we sell it at the same price as the same memory, you know, storage and the same thing, we are going to take a hit on margins, but look at it. It's fricking beautiful. Yes or no. Do we do this?
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:47.000]  I think the final decision on stuff like that is Johnny Ives and not Tim Cook's and I'm not saying that Tim Cook is, is powerless in that way.
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:31:07.000]  I think it's because Tim Cook in his gut knows to defer to Johnny Ive. Technically, ultimately it would be Tim Cook's decision as the CEO that the power resides in the CEO, but that I think within Apple's culture, Johnny Ive gets to make the product decisions in a similar way that Steve Jobs did.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  Even though his title is not CEO, like Johnny Ive wasn't going to be named CEO in a legal way and make, you know, actually make it his title because it's absolutely positively, there are aspects of being CEO that he absolutely simply doesn't want to do.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  And in fact, some of those aspects like of managing people and direct, it actually, him being promoted as chief design officer and having two lieutenants directly below him actually made him less like the CEO of just the design group, that he's more like chairman of the design group.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:56.000]  Yeah, he's kind of like, yeah, and you could say he's kind of the head of product in a really grand scale. I'll give you an example from my life is for whatever, you know, decade plus I was the editor in chief of Macworld.
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  That means that if I want the cover to say something and look a certain way, I get to decree that right, like Tim Cook being the CEO.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  But, you know, I had a really good art director named Rob Schultz for many, many years and he and I would work on these cover designs and, you know, I would come up with lots of wacky ideas and some of them he would be like, no, that's not.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  Or we'd get, we'd have nine sample covers and I'd say, I kind of like number three.
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  And then he and my executive editor would be like, no, number three is not so good.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  Number five is the one I'd be like, all right, well, you know, I'm going to go with you.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:36.000]  And again, I could say, nope, dammit, it's going to be number three, but I feel like Tim Cook maybe is that way with product and design, right?
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  That he's got people to lean on.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000]  He's got Phil Schiller to work with on product and marketing, but he's got Johnny.
[02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:49.000]  And if Johnny says, got to do the jet black, like, you could say no, but are you going to say no to Johnny Ive?
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:53.000]  Like, I wouldn't, it would take a lot for me to say no to my art director.
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:57.000]  And I'm sure it would take way more than that for Tim Cook to say no to Johnny Ive.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  And that's not that Tim Cook's powerless and it's not that Johnny Ive always makes the right decisions, but he's much more likely to be right than Tim Cook.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.000]  And Tim knows it about some decisions.
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  And so that's perfectly reasonable.
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  Because he's not forward facing and because he's not on stage and because he's clearly not as hands-on involved with the day-to-day design of the actual products as he used to be.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  Or if he is, there are these products that even the typical Apple employees who maybe have a sense that he's fading away wouldn't even know.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  Because all he's doing is working on the architecture of the retail stores, which someone who works in the hardware design group for the Macs feels like Johnny is putting less input into it.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:55.000]  Well, you'd have no idea because he's off somewhere else designing tables for Apple stores.
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:03.000]  I'm not sure. I'm not saying I'm betting on that. I wouldn't be surprised if a year from now they say Johnny Ive is retiring and moving to England.
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  And taking a chief design officer emeritus title with him, still technically some part of Apple, but he's emeritus and he's not involved on a day-to-day.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  And I wouldn't be surprised the other way, if he's as engaged as ever, but on other things.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  Moving forward, like architecture now, maybe a car five, six years from now, etc.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens with him.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  I feel like we've reached the point with Johnny Ive where if he wants to go do other things, nobody would say that he's wrong to do so.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  It does feel like he's sort of done everything he can on one level. He's conquered everything.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  And also, I don't think I would feel like he's been there so long.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  I mean, he's been there since the E-Mate, for Pete's sake. He's been there so long that I'm not sure I would be like,
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  oh no, what will Apple do without Johnny Ive at this point? I'm sure some people would.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  Apple is doomed because Johnny Ive is leaving stories. But I feel like not only has he built a culture, like Steve Jobs built a culture,
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  but new people have new ideas and we've had Johnny's ideas for 20 years now.
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  It would be a big one and probably the second biggest that there ever was, but it's not going to be the biggest.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:39.000]  Apple's not going to be the same without blank. So we've been through one that is so much bigger than the next three combined.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  And again, maybe they're not the same and they shouldn't be the same because if they were the same, what's the Dylan lighting?
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  He that's not busy changing is busy dying.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  And Steve, you know, I think part of this era is the continuity with Steve, like with Steve leaving, with Steve dying.
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  I mean, he left and then he passed away. But with that whole period, Apple needed to show that it was still in business and still knew what it was doing.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  And so like presence of Johnny Ive is super important. Steady hand of Tim Cook, super important.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  It's been a few years now, right? I mean, we're passing through that phase of reassure us that Apple's not going to totally crash and burn without Steve there.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  And we can debate and people will still argue that Apple completely lost it after Steve left. Fair enough, whatever, we can debate that.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  But I feel like on a very large scale, Johnny Ive leaving today would not be the freak out that it would have been six months after Steve Jobs died.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  I think that's exactly true. And, you know, I think this book is a very possible sign that it might happen.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  I think the next canary in a coal mine would be an Apple event without a Johnny Ive narrated video.
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  Sometimes I feel like that's his minimum involvement is he may be off driving cars at a test track somewhere in the world, but he comes back for the videos.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  I'm just telling you, if you and I are sitting there next to each other in one of these events next year, maybe next year, maybe next time we see each other, we'll be on the new campus.
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  We're there in March and you're there typing away and I'm scribbling in my notebook and a video comes up and it's narrated by somebody else.
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  I'm going to look at you and you're going to go, hmm.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  I also have a correction to make the Dylan line. I can't believe I botched it. It's he not busy being born is being is busy dying.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  And I can't you can't have a misquoted Bob Dylan lyric stand.
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  Not when not within two minutes of mentioning Steve Jobs.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  If there's ever any way to haunt me, if he's going to spook me beyond the grave, it would be botching a botching a Dylan line.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  All right. Let me thank our sponsors for the show today. Backblaze go to backblaze dot com slash during Fireball Harry's.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  Go to Harry's dot com and remember the code talk show and you'll get a really cool free trial set.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  And Casper, the place where you go to buy mattresses, Casper dot com slash the talk show. Jason Snow, I thank you for your time.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  Where can people hear more Jason Snow?
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  All right. You can get my podcast about tech stuff at relay dot FM.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  I host upgrade and clockwise and I've got a couple other podcasts over there.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  They're a little less techie, but they're over there. And then my pop culture stuff is at the incomparable dot com.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  And all my writing is at six color. I'm going to say something that you probably wouldn't do.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  But I want to bring it up. Is that six colors dot com has a newfangled.
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  I think it's I don't forget when you launch it, but there's a membership at a very one year ago last year.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  And you get some nice extra stuff that I really like.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  I don't even know how you find the time to do it because you get like this weekly newsletter that I don't know how you do it.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  It's my monthly newsletter monthly. I just figure I just figure I don't see some of the way in box.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  So there's a monthly newsletter and there's a something we started a little bit later.
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  There's a weekly podcast that's like. So Dan Morin does the site with me. We used to work together Macworld.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  And we talked for about half an hour about what's going on. And that's a subscriber podcast.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  And people seem to really like the podcast, too. So it sounds it sounds a little different, a little more conversational.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  So, yeah, there's some bonuses. Plus, it helps support us doing the site because, you know, as you know, better than anyone else,
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  making a living as an independent writer on the Web these days.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  We didn't touch on it. We don't have time there. Everybody listening to us surely has heard
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  and read an enormous amount of stuff this week post election about advertising and Facebook and Google and the pressures on advertisers and media sites and fake news.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  And just the way that advertising, even when the money is there, can be a problematic influence.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  I just read if you're bothered by that, things like direct membership support at six colors is the way to act and to actually just do a little thing that can actually help make quality.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  You know, as far as I know, you don't publish fake news. I try not to try very hard.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  It's a great way to do it. Although, you know, that's yeah, I mean, let's see. Let's see. Maybe fake news is my future, but I hope not.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  And, you know, my friend Jason Kotke just started a similar thing at Kotke.org. I signed up like five minutes after he launched it, like sight unseen.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  He emailed me and asked me how mine went and how it worked and stuff like that. It was pretty funny.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  So when he launched, I was like, oh, yes, because, you know, he asked because he's using very much the same system.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  And I was like, hell yeah, I'm in. So anybody who likes independent media, like the work that Jason's doing and Kotke's doing and, you know, go sign up.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  Anyway, thank you so much, Jason. I really appreciate it. Talk to you next time.
