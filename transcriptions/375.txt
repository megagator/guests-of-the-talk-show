[00:00.000 --> 00:03.480]  We're at the most exciting time of the year on the apple calendar.
[00:03.960 --> 00:06.160]  Don't you think I'm reminded of it every year?
[00:06.840 --> 00:08.280]  Yeah, it's, it's like new year's Eve.
[00:08.440 --> 00:13.200]  I mean, I always think of this as the new year's day of the apple calendar is day
[00:13.200 --> 00:17.400]  one of WWDC because it influences everything that happens the rest of the year.
[00:17.720 --> 00:18.040]  Yeah.
[00:18.120 --> 00:24.000]  It's so much more normalized compared to the old days when there were Mac world
[00:24.000 --> 00:32.960]  expos and who knew what was going to happen at WWDC and every one of the OS's
[00:32.960 --> 00:37.000]  didn't necessarily get a major update every single 12 months.
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.120]  Whereas now it is, there's one non hardware event.
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.520]  It's WWDC.
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.520]  Every OS gets a dot O upgrade every 12 months come hell or high water.
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.560]  And so may is always, yeah.
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.040]  It's like Christmas and the 4th of July all in one.
[00:56.080 --> 00:56.320]  Yeah.
[00:56.320 --> 00:58.000]  You can basically bank on the what?
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.400]  Second full week of June that that's going to be WWDC and then the basically
[01:05.400 --> 01:08.120]  right after labor day for the iPhone event.
[01:08.120 --> 01:10.480]  And those are your guaranteed events for the year.
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.520]  I've got an announcement to make if you can believe it.
[01:15.200 --> 01:15.640]  Okay.
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.640]  The live episode of the talk show is coming back.
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.720]  Well, I guess it came back last year, but in sort of half step form with sort of
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.880]  a half step out of covid, but we hopefully I'm taking a flyer here by
[01:31.880 --> 01:35.520]  telling you on the show, but by the time this episode is out, it'll be on
[01:35.520 --> 01:41.760]  daring fireball that it is back in the California theater in San Jose on
[01:41.760 --> 01:50.720]  Wednesday, June seven, I think at 5 p.m. But we don't have a time nailed down yet, so
[01:50.720 --> 01:51.520]  that's exciting.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.680]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:52.840 --> 01:53.280]  I love it.
[01:53.400 --> 01:56.800]  It's I mean, you were in the developer center last year, right?
[01:56.840 --> 01:57.600]  That is correct.
[01:58.680 --> 01:59.600]  I mean, that's nice.
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.520]  It's it's it's nice when Apple furnishes stuff, but I like the idea of you going
[02:05.520 --> 02:07.640]  back to the independent venue.
[02:08.080 --> 02:08.560]  Yeah.
[02:08.560 --> 02:15.560]  Did we have Apple folks and I went back and forth on that last year with no, I
[02:15.560 --> 02:18.760]  say it back and forth makes it sound like there was any sort of disagreement and
[02:18.760 --> 02:19.720]  there was none.
[02:20.200 --> 02:23.520]  It was more how do we work this out?
[02:23.800 --> 02:30.280]  Because there were still, like I said, I think in broad strokes, it was a half step
[02:30.280 --> 02:36.080]  out of covid last year and it just wasn't going to be.
[02:36.080 --> 02:40.960]  I would have me personally, I would have done it in the California theater last
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.520]  year, but I don't even know if that was allowed in California at the time, but it
[02:45.520 --> 02:49.440]  wasn't it wasn't going to go with Apple.
[02:49.880 --> 02:51.760]  I don't it wasn't really even on the table.
[02:52.280 --> 02:58.960]  So it was either a totally prerecorded show, like in the covid years or do it in
[02:58.960 --> 02:59.920]  the developer center.
[02:59.920 --> 03:06.720]  And and even the Apple, everybody was sort of an agreement that it was kind of
[03:06.720 --> 03:07.160]  weird.
[03:07.160 --> 03:08.400]  It's my show.
[03:08.400 --> 03:09.680]  It's not an Apple show.
[03:09.680 --> 03:11.720]  It's not officially part of WWDC.
[03:12.040 --> 03:15.680]  So it's weird that it was on Apple's campus, but it was kind of cool that it
[03:15.680 --> 03:19.720]  was the first public event in that facility, which is really nice.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.200]  And it was the only way to do it.
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.040]  And so I was happy.
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.200]  I actually didn't really, I didn't lose any sleep over it, but I'm glad to be
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.200]  back in an independent venue and I'm excited and now, of course, starting to
[03:31.200 --> 03:37.160]  get sick to my stomach, nervous as hell that it's in a facility that can seat
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.080]  more people because I know people like to come.
[03:39.960 --> 03:44.760]  Yeah, it's the one of the great things about about how WWDC works now versus
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.360]  what it worked before is last year, especially we didn't know it was like,
[03:48.360 --> 03:52.280]  well, some developers will be there and some press will be there, but it's not
[03:52.360 --> 03:55.960]  ever going to be, I think, back to the thousands of people that were there
[03:55.960 --> 03:58.680]  right around the corner from the California theater at the McHenry
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.320]  convention center.
[03:59.320 --> 03:59.600]  Right?
[03:59.600 --> 04:05.760]  So the question I have is, you know, I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  fill that theater, but it's going to be a different crowd because it's
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.440]  going to be people from Apple.
[04:10.760 --> 04:14.320]  It's going to be maybe the developers who are attending, but that's a small
[04:14.320 --> 04:14.640]  number.
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.840]  It's going to be maybe many of your pals in the press who are still there,
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.720]  although a lot of people just jet in for Monday and then get out.
[04:22.120 --> 04:25.720]  And then my guess is you're going to get some regional people, right?
[04:25.720 --> 04:28.840]  Whereas just people in the Bay area who want to come and see the show, but it's
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.200]  a different thing than when you had several thousand attendees who would
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.360]  say, yes, I want to be there.
[04:33.760 --> 04:37.080]  What I have found is that last year, everybody was really tentative about it,
[04:37.280 --> 04:40.520]  but I know so many people who just are assuming they're just coming, right?
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.200]  Like they haven't heard.
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.040]  They, they, they didn't get a developer in fight.
[04:44.040 --> 04:47.160]  They haven't been invited by Apple PR, but they made their hotel reservations.
[04:47.160 --> 04:48.960]  They made their plane reservations and they're coming.
[04:48.960 --> 04:55.560]  So it feels a little more like classic WWDC in that way versus last year where
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.480]  everything was so tentative.
[04:57.080 --> 04:58.640]  Yeah, I don't know how that's going to go either.
[04:58.640 --> 05:01.040]  I'm not worried about selling it out.
[05:01.080 --> 05:06.640]  I mean, knock on wood, but I always got the impression that my previous shows.
[05:07.360 --> 05:13.840]  While it certainly was beneficial that there were 5,000 attendees and some
[05:13.840 --> 05:19.000]  significant portion of them being the sort of people who would want to come to
[05:19.000 --> 05:19.560]  my show.
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.280]  And I say that with no false humility, humility, because as the years went on in
[05:26.280 --> 05:34.240]  the actual live version of WWDC where 5,000 developers attended, there were way
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.600]  more and more every year developers from around the world who spoke other languages.
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.760]  And I'm sure quite frankly, honestly, I've never even heard of me.
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.640]  So I don't think it's false humility to say it wasn't just the 5,000 people who
[05:47.640 --> 05:49.800]  flew in for the conference who were filling the thing.
[05:49.800 --> 05:55.680]  I think it was largely locals anyway, even in recent years, but I don't know that.
[05:56.200 --> 06:02.400]  It's sort of a pulse of the audience perception from the stage.
[06:02.440 --> 06:02.880]  I don't know.
[06:02.880 --> 06:04.280]  There's just something about that.
[06:04.840 --> 06:08.080]  It's a big region with a lot of people who are involved in technology.
[06:08.080 --> 06:12.120]  So I am sure, I mean, that's how I always felt Relay has done some events too.
[06:12.120 --> 06:15.000]  And like, you're not just pulling for the people who are there.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.760]  You're pulling from a region of 7 million people who are probably more disposed
[06:19.760 --> 06:22.520]  than any other region to be into technology.
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.320]  And so, yeah, you got a lot of listeners and a lot of fans and a lot of people
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.120]  interested in, in listening to Apple.
[06:28.120 --> 06:31.120]  And when you get a chance, the very rare to have a public event where you get a
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.800]  chance to listen to somebody interview, presumably Apple executives, presumably
[06:34.800 --> 06:36.600]  it's not going to be me and Moltz, but you never know.
[06:36.640 --> 06:37.960]  I never know.
[06:37.960 --> 06:42.200]  I do not know as we speak, I, I do not.
[06:42.200 --> 06:44.760]  John Moltz ready as he, is he, does he have a ticket?
[06:44.760 --> 06:48.720]  Is he ready to go just in case to pull that standby on Southwest airlines to
[06:48.720 --> 06:49.400]  come on down?
[06:49.560 --> 06:52.640]  Not yet, but maybe I should book a provisional ticket.
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.360]  The other thing too, and I, I realized this, that doing it on Wednesday, usually
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.480]  the traditional day is Tuesday of WWDC week, and it's going to be Wednesday this
[07:01.480 --> 07:01.800]  week.
[07:02.800 --> 07:07.560]  And that probably will, I mean, almost certainly will knock out some of the
[07:07.560 --> 07:12.560]  percentage of the people you talked about who were just flying in, but I bet a lot
[07:12.560 --> 07:18.000]  of those people are sort of flying in on Sunday to hang out all day Monday and see
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.320]  what they can see and are flying out Tuesday or even Wednesday morning or
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.320]  Wednesday afternoon.
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.440]  And so they won't still be around, but hence I'll announce this and maybe they
[07:28.440 --> 07:31.320]  can try to change their travel dates or whatever.
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.640]  But anyway, I'm excited about that.
[07:33.640 --> 07:36.040]  I'm excited to, to get that back to normal.
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.960]  But I also think I wrote today, and I guess it's as good a place as any to
[07:39.960 --> 07:41.920]  start is with headset mania.
[07:41.960 --> 07:45.080]  I've been writing a lot of, I mean, everybody is, I mean, how can you not, how
[07:45.080 --> 07:49.200]  can you not, but I thought it was an inner it, I don't know about you.
[07:49.200 --> 07:54.560]  I, I, this always happens to me is, is some of my best article ideas start with
[07:54.560 --> 07:58.480]  something that either I think is going to be a very short link list item on my
[07:58.480 --> 08:03.960]  site or even just a tweet and Ben Bajarin had a tweet this morning just saying,
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.000]  Hey, I just speculating, maybe the headset would be better in a standalone event
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.200]  later in the year because how are they even going to fit it in a WWDC code
[08:12.200 --> 08:12.720]  keynote?
[08:12.720 --> 08:17.080]  And I almost tweeted back at him and I was like, got to the end of the length of
[08:17.080 --> 08:17.840]  one tweet.
[08:17.840 --> 08:20.000]  And I was like, Hmm, I have more to say about this.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.880]  Maybe I should just write about it.
[08:21.920 --> 08:25.080]  And then it turned it into like 750 words on Daring Fireball.
[08:25.920 --> 08:27.800]  But I do think that's interesting.
[08:28.120 --> 08:31.320]  I, and I mean, my conclusion long story short, I mean, I already wrote the
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.440]  article, so probably people listening have read it, but basically I think the
[08:35.440 --> 08:40.880]  new format of WWDC, which we were just talking about where it's not an onstage
[08:40.880 --> 08:46.560]  keynote and it's not a 5,000 developers in the room watching it happen live.
[08:47.280 --> 08:54.240]  I think that facilitates cramming way more into a sub two under two hour
[08:54.240 --> 08:59.640]  keynote than even vaguely could have been possible with the onstage presentation.
[08:59.640 --> 09:03.560]  Well, remember too, it's, it's a keynote with footnotes and the footnotes are the
[09:03.560 --> 09:04.240]  rest of the week.
[09:04.240 --> 09:07.440]  They're the, the platform state of the union thing that happens in the afternoon.
[09:07.440 --> 09:10.240]  And then all of the other sessions, the rest of the week week, it's really
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.520]  highlights, right?
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.120]  And I think, look, I do think there for a lot is going to be like the Apple watch
[09:16.120 --> 09:18.720]  where there's going to be an initial event and then there's going to be another
[09:18.840 --> 09:22.440]  event, maybe even the iPhone event where they say, well, okay, now we'll tell you
[09:22.440 --> 09:25.640]  the details of when the shipping and what it costs, but, but they will have already
[09:25.640 --> 09:26.480]  taken the lid off of it.
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.040]  And there are so many advantages for them to take the lid off of it at WWDC,
[09:31.040 --> 09:33.760]  because then there's, they can say, we have this other platform.
[09:33.760 --> 09:35.000]  We're going to tell you all about it.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.880]  You know, now that we're doing the hardware, we can admit it.
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.160]  We can, you've seen it.
[09:39.160 --> 09:41.800]  We can, we can give you some details about the hardware.
[09:42.520 --> 09:44.520]  And the game totally changes them.
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.480]  Like once the hardware is known, you could invite people to Cupertino to work on
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.120]  their apps.
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.560]  You could even, this is a, I know it's a wacky idea, but like, you could even
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.480]  start trickling out developer units to, to developers, because one thought I had
[09:59.480 --> 10:02.680]  is even before you ship it, you could probably ship a version of the hardware
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.280]  that just is, yeah, you got to run a beta and tether it to a Mac and it's just for
[10:07.280 --> 10:10.520]  developers and it's useless on its own, but it works for app testing.
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.560]  You can never do that before it's announced, but once it's announced, you
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.840]  could, you could do stuff like that and then still say, well, yeah, but it's end
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.120]  of the year by the time you get it.
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.040]  So I think it's important for them to pull the, the cover off of the app.
[10:23.040 --> 10:25.000]  And say, yes, it is real.
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.520]  We are doing it and let's start the conversation about what it is, but
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.320]  they're going to get another chance, right?
[10:31.320 --> 10:34.720]  Like undoubtedly, if any of these reports are true, it's not going to
[10:34.720 --> 10:36.200]  ship till toward the end of the year.
[10:36.360 --> 10:39.680]  They're going to get another chance to introduce people to this, which for
[10:39.680 --> 10:42.320]  people who don't remember, Apple watch was announced at an iPhone event in
[10:42.320 --> 10:43.920]  September and they shipped it in April.
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.440]  So they, they, and they reintroduced it before they did.
[10:47.520 --> 10:50.120]  So you got a second chance to do that.
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.640]  I, I, and that two stage thing only really happens with brand new products.
[10:53.960 --> 10:56.560]  Feels like maybe they're going to be able to do that this time.
[10:56.560 --> 10:59.800]  And I think there are a lot of benefits to it because then we can spend months
[11:00.120 --> 11:04.080]  having the developer conversation and developers can look at it and build it.
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.240]  And it gets to be out in the open to a degree that it can't be while it's a secret.
[11:08.720 --> 11:09.920]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[11:10.600 --> 11:15.520]  And I do think people forget that about the Apple watch and it wasn't even close.
[11:15.520 --> 11:15.680]  Right?
[11:15.680 --> 11:18.000]  So it was September of 2014.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.680]  So it was September of 2014 where they announced it at the iPhone event.
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.200]  And that was the one off Apple event that was on the, I forget the name of that
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.920]  college in Cupertino to answer something.
[11:34.400 --> 11:35.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:35.320 --> 11:36.400]  It's the Flint center, right?
[11:36.440 --> 11:36.600]  Yeah.
[11:36.600 --> 11:37.440]  The Flint center.
[11:37.720 --> 11:38.120]  Right.
[11:38.120 --> 11:42.560]  Which, which was a historical, historically interesting building for Apple.
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.640]  Because I think that's where Steve jobs pulled the original Macintosh out of the
[11:46.640 --> 11:47.120]  bag.
[11:47.120 --> 11:47.600]  Yeah.
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.760]  And, and then they did the iMac launch there too.
[11:50.560 --> 11:51.320]  Oh, that's right.
[11:51.360 --> 11:51.880]  That's right.
[11:51.960 --> 11:53.560]  I, which I of course was not at.
[11:53.560 --> 11:54.160]  Were you at that?
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.640]  No, that was a string of Apple doing a lot of invitations to the press for events
[11:59.640 --> 12:01.680]  that didn't announce anything and were super boring.
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.000]  And so literally they, they were the, the boy who cried Wolf.
[12:05.280 --> 12:08.640]  So like one person from Mac world went to that event and it was the iMac.
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.520]  And then he gets on the, there's the editor in chief and he calls the staff
[12:11.520 --> 12:11.680]  meeting.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.920]  He's like, everybody get in.
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.720]  We got to like, it was all hands on deck, but yeah, we were, we were like, so
[12:16.720 --> 12:17.640]  jaded at that point.
[12:17.640 --> 12:19.320]  So I didn't, that was my first time.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.160]  The Apple watch event was my first time in the Flint center.
[12:21.440 --> 12:21.720]  Yeah.
[12:21.720 --> 12:24.480]  And that's when you decided you needed to become the editor in chief.
[12:26.720 --> 12:27.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.760]  You just got to go to every event.
[12:29.080 --> 12:30.800]  That's just how you, how you do that.
[12:30.800 --> 12:34.600]  Maybe the last Apple event I missed actually was that one.
[12:34.960 --> 12:36.160]  Oh, that's pretty interesting.
[12:36.160 --> 12:37.720]  Do you think you've made everyone sense?
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.680]  Well, no, that's not true because they did that education event in New York
[12:43.680 --> 12:47.040]  city, where they, I don't even remember what they announced.
[12:47.040 --> 12:49.520]  It was like, it was like iBooks or something.
[12:50.200 --> 12:52.080]  And I didn't go to that one.
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.640]  That was the one that I didn't go to.
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.240]  Did you go to the one in Chicago?
[12:55.640 --> 12:55.880]  Yeah.
[12:56.240 --> 12:56.480]  Yeah.
[12:56.480 --> 12:57.600]  That was education, right?
[12:57.600 --> 12:58.200]  That was iBooks.
[12:58.200 --> 12:58.800]  Yeah, in Brooklyn.
[12:59.120 --> 13:02.040]  But there was the, there was a previous event that was just.
[13:02.520 --> 13:04.240]  No, no, there was one in Chicago.
[13:04.480 --> 13:06.800]  There was one in Chicago that was at a school.
[13:06.800 --> 13:07.520]  It was a high school.
[13:07.520 --> 13:07.720]  Yeah.
[13:07.960 --> 13:08.320]  Yeah.
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.000]  And so you didn't go to the Brooklyn one?
[13:10.640 --> 13:11.520]  I did go to the Brooklyn one.
[13:11.520 --> 13:14.440]  No, there was one a couple of years before the Chicago one.
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.600]  And I think it was just like iBooks author and textbooks and something.
[13:18.600 --> 13:18.960]  Yeah.
[13:19.080 --> 13:19.440]  Yeah.
[13:19.480 --> 13:21.040]  And that one I didn't go to.
[13:21.040 --> 13:21.560]  So, okay.
[13:21.560 --> 13:22.440]  Oh, no, no.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.840]  That was at the Guggenheim.
[13:24.480 --> 13:24.760]  Okay.
[13:24.760 --> 13:24.920]  Yeah.
[13:24.920 --> 13:25.680]  I didn't go to that one.
[13:25.840 --> 13:26.240]  Yeah.
[13:26.280 --> 13:26.640]  Yeah.
[13:26.720 --> 13:26.880]  Yeah.
[13:26.880 --> 13:27.560]  It wasn't worth it.
[13:28.200 --> 13:28.400]  Yeah.
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.960]  That was a really bad event, but.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.320]  Well, you know what, in hindsight, it might've been worth it if they had
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.880]  stuck with iBooks author, which was an incredibly ambitious app.
[13:37.880 --> 13:39.000]  We, I don't want to get derailed.
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.400]  We've got lots of talk about, but it's, it's one of those, like, oh, what if, I
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.960]  was just thinking about it with the make something wonderful book from the Steve
[13:48.960 --> 13:55.160]  Jobs archive, and I think that the website that they have for the public to
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.120]  read for free is really amazing.
[13:57.120 --> 13:59.560]  I think it's, it's just a terrific experience.
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.200]  There's printed books that are limited edition and mostly given out to employees
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.360]  at Apple and Disney and who have one of those, you know, that I do.
[14:08.360 --> 14:09.680]  Did you manage to score one?
[14:11.240 --> 14:13.640]  I am fortunate to have a listener who works at ABC.
[14:14.280 --> 14:16.400]  Ah, Disney employee.
[14:16.800 --> 14:21.800]  Yeah, I drew, I drew a blank at first and then, and took about a half of a thought
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.080]  to file ABC under the Disney conglomerate.
[14:25.120 --> 14:25.680]  So that's good.
[14:25.840 --> 14:26.480]  It's very nice.
[14:26.480 --> 14:26.880]  Right.
[14:27.280 --> 14:27.880]  It's beautiful.
[14:28.160 --> 14:28.840]  Yeah, it really is.
[14:29.400 --> 14:32.160]  But the ebook version is your point here, right?
[14:33.160 --> 14:35.960]  Well, it's the text is fine.
[14:35.960 --> 14:41.240]  And I think that they did a really interesting job collecting interesting
[14:42.200 --> 14:46.160]  words from Steve Jobs that make for a good, thoughtful book.
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.240]  And so in the same way that, that the, the Gutenberg project, right, with the
[14:52.240 --> 14:58.760]  plain text versions of just plain text, just ASCII, plain text of, of out of
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.560]  copyright books, it's all good, right?
[15:02.560 --> 15:07.040]  It's all good, right? I mean, reading is reading and just plain text.
[15:07.880 --> 15:14.480]  Courier 12 version of the great Gatsby is still the great Gatsby, but it's nicer to
[15:14.480 --> 15:16.560]  read a nicely typeset version of something.
[15:16.880 --> 15:19.800]  The ebook to me is just like, it's just the text.
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.360]  I mean, it's just EPUB and whatever.
[15:23.360 --> 15:23.800]  I don't know.
[15:23.800 --> 15:25.200]  I guess that's what format it is.
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.120]  It just lacks all of the panache of the web version.
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.480]  And I books author was something that would have let, you know, if they had
[15:33.480 --> 15:39.800]  stuck with it, enabled the sort of nice things, transitions and scaling and
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.400]  pinching and multi-touch and blah, blah, blah, you know, might've made for a nice
[15:44.400 --> 15:44.960]  experience.
[15:44.960 --> 15:50.520]  It's just, just kind of an odd thing to me that, I mean, I know that's a whole side
[15:50.520 --> 15:57.200]  discussion that's sorry state of interactive eBooks, but to me, that's,
[15:57.200 --> 16:02.000]  it's, it's exhibit a, because clearly with the effort that they put into the web
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.080]  version, if they could have done it with the book, they would have, anyway, yeah.
[16:09.320 --> 16:12.160]  Back to WWDC this year and the headset.
[16:12.680 --> 16:13.320]  No, I do.
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.320]  I, I, and again, I don't know anything.
[16:16.360 --> 16:25.560]  I literally know nothing, no more than 1% more than the, whatever, like the Mac
[16:25.560 --> 16:32.400]  rumors summary of what do we know so far about the headset outline that's publicly
[16:32.400 --> 16:33.080]  available.
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.800]  I, so I don't know that it's coming, but boy, I will be shocked if it doesn't.
[16:38.840 --> 16:43.680]  I mean, it would, I would consider it one of the, if, if, if WWDC comes and goes
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.560]  without mention of it, I would consider it the most shocking we expected blank.
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.040]  And it didn't happen in the, in my entire career that, that at this point.
[16:53.040 --> 16:57.880]  I even, I mean, I heard from a friend of a friend months ago, they said the
[16:57.880 --> 17:00.560]  hardware is done, like the hardware is done.
[17:01.240 --> 17:03.560]  So it would be, yeah, I, I, I think this is happening.
[17:03.560 --> 17:04.160]  It's funny though.
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.280]  I am seeing some denial out there from people who are like, I think it's, look, I
[17:09.280 --> 17:14.240]  think we've been, we're the proverbial frog in the water that's heating up.
[17:14.600 --> 17:17.800]  We've been getting this out in dribs and drabs for like years now.
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.960]  And especially in the last six months and Mark Gurman has done an amazing job at
[17:21.960 --> 17:24.960]  pulling out all these details, including some that are bizarre that we can talk
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.840]  about, but, but in general, you start to get a feel of it.
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.960]  And, and Quinn Nelson did that amazing YouTube video where he walked through
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.480]  like the technology that's involved in the state of the art and all of that.
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.360]  That's going on.
[17:37.840 --> 17:40.320]  And you really start to think, okay, this is a real product.
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.560]  I understand why they're doing it, but there are other people for whom that
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.160]  Wall Street Journal story or that Bloomberg business week story were
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.760]  the first they heard about it.
[17:50.760 --> 17:53.600]  And I am definitely seeing people who are like, what?
[17:53.760 --> 17:55.040]  I can't believe they're doing that.
[17:55.040 --> 17:59.040]  And it's like, I think we all went through that and, but we've all moved
[17:59.040 --> 18:01.760]  on now to like, okay, let's accept that it exists.
[18:01.760 --> 18:02.400]  What is it?
[18:02.640 --> 18:06.880]  But, uh, it is, it has been funny to see people react that way this week and, and,
[18:07.040 --> 18:10.800]  and over the next couple of weeks until it actually gets unveiled and
[18:10.880 --> 18:12.280]  then everybody will freak out again.
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.280]  I, I mentioned, I am reminded of the run up to the iPhone announcement in 2007,
[18:18.280 --> 18:28.720]  2007, where there'd been, as I recall, there were, Hey, wouldn't it be great if
[18:28.720 --> 18:35.120]  Apple made a cell phone rumors at least as far back as like the beginning of that
[18:35.120 --> 18:35.640]  decade?
[18:35.680 --> 18:38.840]  Like I would say as soon as the iPod came out, right?
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.640]  Because I think the iPod was sort of the existence proof that, Hey, Apple can make
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.000]  like a standalone really cool thing that fits in your pocket.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.320]  And you're sitting there, you've got like your iPod in one pocket and you love it.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.600]  And it was super cool and it was just amazing.
[18:55.600 --> 18:57.800]  And you're like, I just can't believe how cool this thing is.
[18:58.040 --> 19:03.480]  And then you had your pre iPhone 2001 cell phone in your other pocket and you
[19:03.480 --> 19:04.040]  hated it.
[19:05.520 --> 19:10.680]  And you knew the thing that we all knew is that Steve jobs had some cell phone
[19:10.680 --> 19:12.360]  too, and we knew that he hated it.
[19:12.680 --> 19:13.000]  Right.
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.800]  So it was, I remember talking to people who worked at Apple in that those years,
[19:18.800 --> 19:21.760]  like between 2001 and 2007.
[19:21.800 --> 19:29.320]  And, and it was like a thing for Apple employees to know what phone did Steve
[19:29.320 --> 19:29.880]  carry.
[19:29.960 --> 19:30.280]  Right.
[19:30.280 --> 19:34.040]  And I think for a lot of those years, he had a razor, which at the time was like
[19:34.040 --> 19:35.080]  the definition of cool.
[19:35.080 --> 19:35.960]  Cause it was thin.
[19:36.480 --> 19:40.280]  That's the phone that Tom cruise had in eyes wide shut.
[19:40.280 --> 19:46.680]  The Motorola razor was the, the cool phone circa 1999, 2000, 2001.
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.400]  And, but like if he got like a new phone, word would spread like, Hey, Steve
[19:52.400 --> 19:54.920]  bought a blank and who knows what piece of crap it was.
[19:54.920 --> 19:56.880]  And then other people at Apple would go buy it.
[19:56.880 --> 20:01.680]  Not because it was like, it's not like people walked around Apple's campus
[20:01.680 --> 20:07.000]  wearing black turtlenecks and wearing gray new balance nine 90 ones or whatever
[20:07.000 --> 20:07.680]  the number was.
[20:07.680 --> 20:11.840]  But it was the idea that if Steve bought it, it must be the best thing that's out
[20:11.840 --> 20:12.080]  there.
[20:12.080 --> 20:13.920]  So why bother doing my own research?
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.520]  I'll just get the one that Steve jobs bought and you'd, but you knew he hated
[20:17.520 --> 20:17.760]  it.
[20:17.760 --> 20:19.040]  So you knew it must be coming.
[20:20.360 --> 20:25.480]  And then though, when we got closer word started leaking out that I don't know
[20:25.480 --> 20:29.640]  people, there's word out there that Apple's working on an iPhone and, or not
[20:29.640 --> 20:32.480]  an iPhone, but a Apple phone or an iPhone.
[20:32.880 --> 20:36.400]  I think I've, yeah, they were iPod phones, but I think iPhone got right.
[20:36.400 --> 20:37.480]  iPhone got right.
[20:37.680 --> 20:38.720]  I'm actually surprised.
[20:38.720 --> 20:42.640]  I was surprised that it actually was iPhone in the end because it had been the
[20:42.640 --> 20:47.880]  rumor name for so long that everybody just assumed it wouldn't be actually an
[20:47.880 --> 20:48.360]  iPhone.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.240]  And yeah, that you're right.
[20:49.480 --> 20:53.520]  Very early on the idea was, yeah, there will be an iPod phone.
[20:53.520 --> 20:54.320]  Why not do that?
[20:54.320 --> 20:57.280]  They were looking at the iPod and saying, that's a software platform.
[20:57.280 --> 21:00.840]  Apple could use to build a smartphone that would also be an iPod.
[21:00.840 --> 21:04.200]  And of course they, they were thinking bigger than that, but that was the
[21:04.200 --> 21:06.600]  initial thought in the early two thousands.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.840]  Yeah, I think he even, and, and remember there was the whole thing.
[21:09.840 --> 21:12.920]  I know we're getting, we always get, you and I always get derailed down memory
[21:12.920 --> 21:13.160]  lane.
[21:13.160 --> 21:15.040]  We haven't talked about sports or keyboards at least.
[21:15.720 --> 21:20.960]  But there was the trademark that Cisco held on iPhone, which is bizarre.
[21:21.600 --> 21:23.000]  Remember, I think it was Cisco.
[21:23.080 --> 21:23.520]  I don't know.
[21:23.520 --> 21:28.160]  It was some big company, but, but when he announced the name, he was like, and
[21:28.160 --> 21:30.320]  yes, we're calling it iPhone.
[21:30.320 --> 21:34.360]  And I don't know the crowd almost like stormed the storm, the stage at that
[21:34.360 --> 21:34.680]  point.
[21:36.240 --> 21:36.520]  Yeah.
[21:37.160 --> 21:40.200]  But what I remember was I flew out.
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.840]  I'm so lucky timing wise that that's when my, Hey, okay.
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.600]  I do get press credentials and can sit in the keynote audience.
[21:48.680 --> 21:52.200]  It was like one of the first events I went to wasn't the first, but it was
[21:52.200 --> 21:56.480]  close to it where the budget from whatever I was making a daring fireballs.
[21:56.480 --> 22:02.360]  Justified, or at least loosely, vaguely justified flying out to California.
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.280]  I remember getting there like the day before and the rumors were getting pretty
[22:08.280 --> 22:13.200]  rampant and I ran into James Duncan Davidson and I think it was, it was
[22:13.200 --> 22:14.120]  Daniel Steinberg.
[22:14.120 --> 22:18.760]  They were sitting in a coffee shop on market street around the corner, block
[22:18.760 --> 22:21.520]  or two away from Moscone the day before.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.280]  And I knew them both and I was like, Hey, there's somebody I know.
[22:24.280 --> 22:27.760]  And we stopped and I got a cup of coffee and we started talking and it quickly
[22:27.760 --> 22:29.680]  turned to, are they going to do a phone tomorrow?
[22:29.680 --> 22:30.240]  Is it a phone?
[22:30.240 --> 22:30.840]  Is it a phone?
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.480]  And the three of us concluded they were definitely doing a phone because there
[22:35.480 --> 22:39.320]  was no, there were no counter rumors.
[22:39.400 --> 22:44.280]  There was no, no, no article in the wall street journals of saying those
[22:44.280 --> 22:45.760]  speculation is running high.
[22:45.800 --> 22:49.440]  Some sources close to the company say there's no phone coming.
[22:49.440 --> 22:50.400]  Nobody was saying that.
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.840]  But the other thing that's funny about that is that we had to go by memory
[22:53.840 --> 22:58.400]  because sitting at a coffee shop in the middle of the afternoon, there was no
[22:58.400 --> 23:02.160]  way for us to check whether any kind of news had broken because we didn't have
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.480]  iPhones yet, but we really did come to the conclusion that they must be
[23:06.480 --> 23:10.560]  announcing a phone tomorrow because if they weren't, they would have done
[23:10.560 --> 23:15.760]  something through the grapevine to at least somewhat dampen the expectations
[23:15.880 --> 23:19.760]  so that whatever it was they were announcing, they would have done
[23:19.760 --> 23:20.160]  something.
[23:20.400 --> 23:21.680]  Wouldn't be a total letdown.
[23:22.520 --> 23:23.960]  The silence spoke.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.360]  And I think we're at the same situation with the headset where if it weren't
[23:28.360 --> 23:32.960]  coming, there would be somebody out there could be me.
[23:33.000 --> 23:33.960]  I mean, it could be me.
[23:33.960 --> 23:36.640]  Who's saying, I don't know what the little birdies are saying.
[23:36.720 --> 23:37.400]  Exactly right.
[23:37.400 --> 23:41.960]  Apple would look managing expectations as part of the job, I would say.
[23:42.760 --> 23:46.360]  And if you're, if you're at Apple, if you're an Apple PR, Apple marketing
[23:46.360 --> 23:51.640]  managing expectations as part of the job, you don't want to be a
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.880]  disappointment if you can, if you can help it right.
[23:53.880 --> 23:57.240]  Like, so a rumor, like the iPad is going to cost a thousand dollars.
[23:57.240 --> 23:58.280]  You don't bat that down.
[23:58.320 --> 23:58.840]  That's great.
[23:58.840 --> 23:59.600]  That works for you.
[23:59.920 --> 24:00.240]  Right.
[24:00.280 --> 24:03.440]  But if it's a rumor that the iPad is going to cost a hundred dollars, you
[24:03.440 --> 24:06.440]  got to basically leak something that says that's not accurate.
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.320]  It's going to be 500.
[24:07.640 --> 24:10.880]  And the fact that there hasn't been a story that says, Oh, well, it's not
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.640]  really happening suggests, and in fact, And I, I honestly don't know this and
[24:15.640 --> 24:20.240]  it may not be the case, but it sure feels like when I read some things
[24:20.240 --> 24:24.240]  like that wall street journal story that talks about the price and talk,
[24:24.280 --> 24:27.920]  it's a high price, but they're going to be other models and it's going to
[24:27.920 --> 24:33.800]  be mostly developers and they don't expect to sell too many, I read that.
[24:33.800 --> 24:37.720]  And I'm like, well, either this is a fortunate bit of reporting for Apple
[24:38.120 --> 24:45.440]  because it's setting the bar or it's Apple setting them up and I
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.840]  just got that vibe this week.
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.080]  And in the past like week, week and a half, it starts to feel like, I
[24:51.080 --> 24:55.320]  don't know if it's Apple's hand, but it's, it's doing what Apple's hand
[24:55.320 --> 24:59.080]  would be doing, which is saying, let's set expectations for this thing.
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.360]  Cause what they, what they don't want everybody to think is it's going to
[25:02.360 --> 25:05.560]  cost a thousand dollars, everybody's going to buy one and it's going to be
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.760]  revolutionary and they're going to sell millions of them.
[25:07.760 --> 25:10.880]  What they want people to think is it's going to be expensive.
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.600]  They're going to be in, in a low volume for that first year. And
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.320]  the idea here is the long game.
[25:17.320 --> 25:24.480]  And so please do not judge us based on, on, on step one of a multi-step process.
[25:24.480 --> 25:27.640]  And like, so I don't know if Apple's actually the one managing that, that
[25:27.640 --> 25:30.240]  expectation, but it certainly gives me that vibe, right?
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.120]  That they're like, that it serves them to do that.
[25:33.120 --> 25:36.720]  And that it is important because as you said, like if they weren't going
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.000]  to introduce an iPhone, somebody would have put something somewhere that
[25:40.000 --> 25:40.960]  was like, I don't know.
[25:41.360 --> 25:42.320]  I don't think so.
[25:42.480 --> 25:45.760]  And there's none of that right now, but I do think that there's, I do
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.400]  think that there's some bar setting that is yeah, either, either fortuitous
[25:49.400 --> 25:51.640]  for Apple or actually Apple doing it.
[25:52.120 --> 25:52.440]  Right.
[25:52.440 --> 25:56.600]  It's like people forget that in the run-up to an announcement, everything.
[25:57.440 --> 26:00.040]  From Apple's perspective should be as well.
[26:00.040 --> 26:01.840]  That sounds terrible as possible.
[26:02.080 --> 26:07.400]  It should sound too expensive, too heavy, too impractical, too useless.
[26:07.640 --> 26:08.880]  Should run too hot.
[26:08.880 --> 26:10.560]  The battery shouldn't last long.
[26:11.120 --> 26:15.680]  I mean, you, you name it and then they can come in and better it.
[26:15.720 --> 26:18.880]  It's a lower price than you thought it lasts longer than you thought.
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.480]  It's way more useful than you thought.
[26:21.560 --> 26:22.920]  It's cooler than you thought.
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.320]  It's smaller than you thought.
[26:24.320 --> 26:25.560]  It's lighter than you thought.
[26:25.600 --> 26:26.280]  All of that.
[26:26.600 --> 26:29.760]  The last thing you want is for people to think it's going to be, you know,
[26:29.760 --> 26:33.440]  $500 and it's a pair of glasses you can wear all day, every day.
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.960]  Because that's not going to happen.
[26:36.280 --> 26:37.480]  No, no, not, not yet.
[26:37.480 --> 26:37.640]  Right.
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.320]  Which is why I think I keep toying with the idea, like how much is Apple
[26:41.320 --> 26:42.280]  going to say about the future?
[26:42.280 --> 26:44.960]  Cause I feel like there's an opportunity for them to say, this is
[26:44.960 --> 26:46.760]  the beginning of a long journey.
[26:46.760 --> 26:49.680]  We think that we're going to, we're working on future products.
[26:49.720 --> 26:52.320]  They don't talk about future products, but to say, this is a platform.
[26:52.480 --> 26:53.960]  We're going to build other products down the road.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.080]  This is just the start of it.
[26:55.400 --> 26:57.640]  I think there's an opportunity for them to do that here.
[26:57.640 --> 27:01.280]  And it serves them well to do that because I don't think this
[27:01.280 --> 27:02.480]  product makes sense on its own.
[27:02.480 --> 27:05.600]  It makes sense as product one of a, of a long journey.
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.880]  And I really firmly believe that everybody at Apple really is thinking
[27:10.040 --> 27:13.480]  the reason we're on this journey is we want to get to the point in 10
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.640]  or 20 years where the technology has advanced so much that it is
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.520]  like wearing a pair of glasses, but you got to start somewhere.
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.480]  And this is where we're starting.
[27:21.400 --> 27:21.760]  Right.
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.400]  I mean, it's think about the, the literally go back to the original
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.800]  Macintosh, which had what 128 kilobytes of Ram.
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.240]  I mean, it was pretty limited 400 kilobyte floppy disk.
[27:35.240 --> 27:38.320]  One, one, one 400 kilobyte floppy disk.
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.200]  Pretty limited, you know, you got to start somewhere and real artists ship.
[27:43.200 --> 27:45.840]  I think that's the other part of it is all those arguments is like, well,
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.440]  maybe they should just not release it and just keep developing it for the next decade.
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.720]  It's like, no, not only is that kind of hard to imagine, and I don't
[27:53.720 --> 27:56.520]  know anybody would want to work on an invisible product for that long,
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.640]  but also they don't know, right?
[27:58.640 --> 28:01.240]  It's like the Apple watch that when they unveiled the Apple watch, they're like.
[28:01.760 --> 28:02.680]  What doesn't it do?
[28:02.680 --> 28:04.280]  It does everything good luck.
[28:04.280 --> 28:04.880]  Good luck.
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.280]  And then they learned and they learned what, what worked and what didn't work
[28:08.280 --> 28:12.560]  in the Apple watch because people told them, right, customers are like, I never
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.440]  use digital touch or glances get rid of them and they're like, okay, okay.
[28:16.440 --> 28:16.920]  Okay.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.840]  We got it.
[28:18.040 --> 28:20.280]  And you don't learn that unless you ship the product.
[28:20.320 --> 28:23.360]  I mean, that's, that's the truth of it is not only do real artists ship,
[28:23.360 --> 28:26.480]  because at some point you need to ship, but like shipping leads to
[28:26.480 --> 28:28.760]  learning, which leads to iterating.
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.080]  And that's as, as you pointed out in that Mac world column, you wrote
[28:32.080 --> 28:34.600]  but way back when, which I noticed you have now republished on daring
[28:34.600 --> 28:37.720]  fireball, very well done, well done, well done, it's in your contract.
[28:37.720 --> 28:38.560]  You're allowed to do that.
[28:38.880 --> 28:40.280]  Apple rolls, Apple iterates.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.080]  That's what they do.
[28:41.160 --> 28:43.360]  So you got to start before you can iterate.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.160]  So here we go.
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.000]  The other thing, the other missing feature that the original Apple
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.720]  watch had was lasting all day.
[28:50.680 --> 28:55.720]  I mean, I forget what language they used, but it was like, I don't know.
[28:55.960 --> 28:58.400]  This is not a quote, but it paraphrasing.
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.480]  It was like most of the day battery life or something tells the time.
[29:04.440 --> 29:05.520]  Very accurately.
[29:05.520 --> 29:07.320]  It's the most accurate time piece in the world.
[29:07.320 --> 29:10.480]  Jason, that's, I mean, when people ask me when I had a pebble before
[29:10.480 --> 29:12.480]  the Apple watch came out, they asked me like, how is it?
[29:12.480 --> 29:13.560]  I said, tell us the time.
[29:13.560 --> 29:17.080]  I mean, like baseline for a watch is, does it tell the time there?
[29:17.120 --> 29:18.040]  You and I are obvious.
[29:18.040 --> 29:21.280]  This is why we made the, the career choices that we did.
[29:21.280 --> 29:22.800]  I can't wait to get the 1.0.
[29:22.800 --> 29:26.320]  We're obviously the opposite of typical consumers.
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.120]  Yeah, yeah, but yeah.
[29:28.120 --> 29:32.720]  The sort of, but the sort of people out there and I'm sure there's tons of them
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.120]  who read our sites and listen to our podcasts and they are enthusiasts, but
[29:37.120 --> 29:41.760]  they sort of have like a standing rule that they never buy a 1.0 hardware product.
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.600]  They're they're very wise people, even from Apple.
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.840]  Yes, you won't go wrong.
[29:46.840 --> 29:50.400]  If you have the patience to wait a year you almost certainly won't go wrong.
[29:51.400 --> 29:54.600]  Was Apple watch released one year too early?
[29:54.600 --> 29:59.560]  Maybe I would say Apple watch is the one that I would think in hindsight,
[29:59.600 --> 30:02.760]  maybe could have waited one more year.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.840]  Yeah, the pressure on them was so enormous though, right?
[30:05.840 --> 30:08.400]  It was like, it was so enormous.
[30:08.440 --> 30:12.800]  And I guess my question would be if they'd waited a year, would they have been able
[30:12.800 --> 30:17.080]  to come up with what they came up with next or was part of it that they had to
[30:17.080 --> 30:19.000]  be out there and make that tough lesson?
[30:19.040 --> 30:21.440]  Like their software was not emphasizing the right things.
[30:21.440 --> 30:25.040]  I think both the software and the hardware wasn't quite there yet,
[30:25.040 --> 30:29.120]  which is a double whammy where the hardware didn't get through the day.
[30:29.640 --> 30:31.760]  The software wasn't fully baked.
[30:31.760 --> 30:36.320]  The certainly the third party SDK was garbage.
[30:36.360 --> 30:40.480]  I mean, I don't even, I'm not being facetious here.
[30:40.480 --> 30:47.000]  I mean, it's, I've never heard developers speak more poorly about an SDK.
[30:47.400 --> 30:50.480]  No, I mean, you were running apps on the iPhone and then just pushing screens
[30:50.480 --> 30:51.680]  to the Apple watch.
[30:51.680 --> 30:54.800]  It was not, it's even charitably an SDK.
[30:54.840 --> 30:55.040]  Yeah.
[30:55.040 --> 31:00.040]  And in consistently in it, you couldn't even count on the screens getting there.
[31:00.080 --> 31:04.400]  It was, it was, and yet they pushed that thing out and maybe it was a little too
[31:04.400 --> 31:08.280]  early, but it didn't kill the platform and they learned and they progressed.
[31:08.360 --> 31:08.760]  Right.
[31:08.840 --> 31:14.360]  And it could just be the fact that I know where we all know that they were
[31:14.360 --> 31:19.520]  under enormous pressure to prove they could ship something new post Steve jobs.
[31:19.520 --> 31:22.400]  And how can you not sympathize?
[31:22.400 --> 31:27.320]  And, and honestly, it's not even, not even on a personal basis of sympathizing
[31:27.360 --> 31:31.400]  with their perhaps pulling the trigger one year too early.
[31:31.400 --> 31:37.320]  I think it was important fiscally, Tim Cook, certainly his perspective
[31:37.320 --> 31:41.240]  on the company, he has a responsibility to do well by shareholders.
[31:41.280 --> 31:45.560]  So I, I would say in hindsight, if, if I could go back in time and give them
[31:45.560 --> 31:48.480]  advice, I'd say they were probably right to ship it, but that would be the
[31:48.480 --> 31:53.880]  one product where engineering wise, I would say it was one year too early,
[31:53.880 --> 31:57.160]  but in the context of everything else that was going on, it was
[31:57.160 --> 31:58.320]  probably the right time to do it.
[31:59.320 --> 32:03.280]  But yeah, and there are, you know, the rumors about this headset, there
[32:03.280 --> 32:07.000]  are compromises there that I'm sure that Apple didn't want to make, but
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.960]  felt they had to make in order to ship it at the same time, though, being
[32:09.960 --> 32:16.760]  those 1.0 people that we are, it feels to me like Apple decided to air on the
[32:16.760 --> 32:20.840]  side of making this the most impressive piece of hardware they could, instead
[32:20.840 --> 32:24.000]  of it being kind of like, I feel like Apple's trying to prove that this
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.040]  category makes sense.
[32:25.120 --> 32:28.360]  I feel like that's, what's going based on the rumors that it's expensive and
[32:28.360 --> 32:31.360]  they really sort of spared no expense on a lot of the hardware stuff.
[32:32.240 --> 32:36.200]  And we're willing to do things like do an outboard battery because they
[32:36.200 --> 32:38.800]  needed to get the balance of the headset, right.
[32:38.800 --> 32:43.040]  Even though it's in elegant, it feels to me like they're kind of trying to say,
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.920]  we're going to show people why we think this matters and then we'll figure
[32:47.920 --> 32:49.600]  out how to bring it to the masses.
[32:49.640 --> 32:55.680]  And I, like, I was talking to Dan Morin about this earlier today, who I work
[32:55.680 --> 32:59.680]  with on Six Colors, I said, we talk so much about the Apple strategy conversation
[32:59.680 --> 33:03.800]  about the headset and not so much about the product side of it, which is like,
[33:03.880 --> 33:08.960]  I'm very excited by the, about this product, because I think if these reports
[33:08.960 --> 33:15.440]  are right, it will be by far the best virtual reality, anything ever made.
[33:16.120 --> 33:18.520]  And that'll be really interesting to see.
[33:19.200 --> 33:20.120]  And will it be a flop?
[33:20.120 --> 33:20.720]  Will people buy it?
[33:20.720 --> 33:25.280]  Those are all business conversations, but as a pure product, unlike that original
[33:25.280 --> 33:29.080]  Apple watch, it feels like this is, this is a product that is not priced to sell,
[33:29.080 --> 33:31.480]  but priced, but dressed to impress.
[33:31.480 --> 33:31.960]  Right.
[33:31.960 --> 33:35.720]  Like, and so I can't wait to put it on my eyeballs and see what happens.
[33:36.200 --> 33:36.520]  All right.
[33:36.520 --> 33:37.040]  Let's take a break here.
[33:37.040 --> 33:39.080]  And I'll thank our first sponsor.
[33:39.120 --> 33:42.560]  And it's one of my favorite companies, literally in the world, Backblaze.
[33:43.120 --> 33:48.160]  Backblaze gives you unlimited computer backups for Macs, PCs, and businesses.
[33:48.480 --> 33:51.440]  Now you might think, well, backups, that's boring, right?
[33:51.480 --> 33:56.320]  Nobody has fun with backups because ideally you never need a backup, right?
[33:56.320 --> 34:00.960]  So what's the fun of paying for a service that you hope you never need?
[34:01.520 --> 34:05.600]  Well, the fun is when you do need it and you have it.
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.160]  And you have it.
[34:07.160 --> 34:10.160]  And instead of being up the creek without a paddle,
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.880]  you've actually got everything that you need and you can get it back.
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.480]  You pay. Here's the deal.
[34:16.480 --> 34:20.240]  You sign up for Backblaze, you pay seven bucks a month per computer,
[34:20.920 --> 34:24.360]  and it backs up all your documents, your music, your photos, your videos,
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.360]  your drawings, your contracts, your projects, all of your stuff.
[34:28.360 --> 34:31.440]  And it puts it in the cloud on Backblaze's servers.
[34:31.440 --> 34:35.320]  Then you that's it, that your stuff is backed up.
[34:35.560 --> 34:37.280]  It runs in the background on your Mac.
[34:37.280 --> 34:38.720]  It runs very quietly.
[34:38.720 --> 34:42.840]  You you can monitor it in activity, monitor and take a look.
[34:42.840 --> 34:45.800]  See, is it like running, taking up a bunch of CPU?
[34:45.840 --> 34:48.400]  No, it's like invisible in the background.
[34:48.720 --> 34:51.920]  But it just continuously keeps everything in your user
[34:51.920 --> 34:55.320]  account on your Mac up to date in the cloud.
[34:55.320 --> 34:56.760]  It's always backed up.
[34:56.760 --> 34:58.360]  You can get your stuff.
[34:58.360 --> 35:01.000]  You go to backblaze.com, get it over the web.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.760]  You can be on your phone or your iPad and get it through their app
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.160]  and just access a file or something like that.
[35:07.160 --> 35:11.760]  If you need to just access one of your files or if disaster strikes
[35:11.760 --> 35:18.040]  and like your MacBook is stolen or completely destroyed in like
[35:18.040 --> 35:22.200]  you spill water over it or something like that and you've lost all of you
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.800]  just don't have it right there.
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.800]  You can just go to backblaze.com and they'll send you a USB drive
[35:27.800 --> 35:28.800]  with all of your stuff.
[35:28.800 --> 35:31.520]  They'll FedEx it to you overnight.
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.680]  And once you restore it from the drive, you can send the drive
[35:35.680 --> 35:37.800]  back to them and get the money back for the drive.
[35:37.800 --> 35:39.160]  So you don't even pay for the drive.
[35:39.160 --> 35:40.320]  They just send it to you.
[35:40.320 --> 35:41.400]  You send the drive back.
[35:41.400 --> 35:44.560]  You've got all everything, your entire account.
[35:44.560 --> 35:47.600]  Now, is it like limited to one terabyte or something like that?
[35:47.600 --> 35:48.800]  No, it's everything.
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.320]  However much you've got on your Mac, you just pay seven bucks a month
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.280]  and it all goes to backblaze and you can get it back whenever you want.
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.320]  It's I've been using it for I don't know.
[35:58.320 --> 36:03.120]  Years and years and years, and I it's just a fantastic service.
[36:03.120 --> 36:04.800]  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
[36:04.800 --> 36:07.840]  I hope you never need it, but I do hope you sign up for it
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.520]  and have it so that when you do need it, you can get it.
[36:11.520 --> 36:15.600]  They have over fifty five billion files have been restored by their customers.
[36:15.600 --> 36:17.200]  So people do need backups.
[36:17.200 --> 36:19.360]  Trust me, I recommend it.
[36:19.360 --> 36:20.720]  The New York Times recommends it.
[36:20.720 --> 36:22.080]  Macworld recommends it.
[36:22.080 --> 36:23.600]  All sorts of sites recommend it.
[36:23.600 --> 36:26.560]  I mean, it's just my favorite online backup.
[36:26.560 --> 36:30.480]  You can get a full featured 15 day, no credit card required.
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.920]  Free trial at backblaze dot com slash the talk show.
[36:35.920 --> 36:37.520]  Go there, play with it.
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.120]  Start protecting yourself from any potential harm or theft or anything like that.
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.640]  Backblaze dot com slash the talk show.
[36:48.640 --> 36:52.640]  Don't be the person who forgot to back up their important files.
[36:52.640 --> 36:53.440]  They'll get it.
[36:53.440 --> 36:54.640]  And guess what?
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.040]  Guess what, if you're that person who doesn't have it, you're going to feel even worse if
[36:59.040 --> 37:02.480]  you need it because you're going to think, I just heard Gruber tell me on the talk show,
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.880]  I should have signed up for backblaze dot com seven bucks a month backblaze dot com
[37:06.880 --> 37:10.560]  slash the talk show.
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.600]  I guess I also think the other thing that the watch is the one I'll go back to with
[37:15.600 --> 37:20.880]  that six month sort of gap between, hey, here it is, here's the thing, blah, blah, blah,
[37:20.880 --> 37:21.200]  blah.
[37:21.200 --> 37:22.080]  Here it is.
[37:22.080 --> 37:24.320]  And then six months later, here's the event.
[37:24.320 --> 37:25.440]  Here's where it actually is.
[37:25.440 --> 37:26.800]  We're going to reintroduce it.
[37:26.800 --> 37:28.400]  And now you can actually buy it.
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.400]  A couple of reasons for that.
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.600]  I think one, I think there actually are going to want developers to start writing software
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.560]  for this thing, even if they don't have it like you talked about.
[37:38.560 --> 37:40.560]  Maybe they'll have some kind of developer kits.
[37:41.120 --> 37:42.800]  Maybe it'll just be a simulator.
[37:43.520 --> 37:48.320]  Maybe it'll just be something stupid that that's stupid, but, you know, very much unlike
[37:48.320 --> 37:54.320]  wearing actual VR headset, but something that you run on your phone and sort of hold it
[37:54.320 --> 37:56.080]  up and hold your phone in front of your face.
[37:56.080 --> 37:56.400]  Right.
[37:56.400 --> 37:56.640]  Yeah.
[37:57.360 --> 38:05.120]  But to at least give developers a cup of the summer to start writing some stuff, or even
[38:05.120 --> 38:06.480]  if it's not developers, right?
[38:06.480 --> 38:12.320]  Because this is sort of getting outside my expertise because I'm not an expert in the
[38:13.120 --> 38:15.120]  existing headsets overall.
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.160]  But there's more than software.
[38:18.160 --> 38:21.680]  There's content you can create for VR, right?
[38:21.680 --> 38:23.440]  Like 3D models.
[38:23.440 --> 38:29.440]  And sure, there's other sorts of things that are developer-ish, even if you're not writing
[38:29.440 --> 38:38.320]  Swift code, but making things to be enjoyed in VR or AR, whichever aspect of the XR you're
[38:38.320 --> 38:39.200]  focused on.
[38:39.200 --> 38:45.440]  But to spend the summer getting ready for it, according to the volumes of developer
[38:45.440 --> 38:50.320]  information that presumably they'll publish in the afternoon after the keynote.
[38:50.320 --> 38:50.960]  Yeah.
[38:50.960 --> 38:57.040]  And then in September, whether it's at the iPhone event, which I think is probably likely
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.320]  because that's the key hardware event, I think that they probably would reintroduce it in
[39:02.320 --> 39:07.440]  September alongside the iPhone and presumably this year's new Apple Watch models.
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.800]  And I could see them, again, not to get ourselves one event ahead of ourselves, but I could
[39:12.800 --> 39:18.960]  see them easily being able to devote a big chunk of that event to the headset again because
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.000]  I would guess that this year's watches won't need much more time because last year was
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.680]  the big year where they introduced the new Ultra model.
[39:27.680 --> 39:32.800]  So I would guess this year we'll just see Ultra 2 and the new refinement on the regular
[39:32.800 --> 39:33.600]  sized watches.
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.680]  So I think there'd be plenty of time for a half an hour to recap the headset and blah,
[39:39.680 --> 39:40.640]  blah, blah.
[39:40.640 --> 39:46.160]  The one thing that I'm pretty I'll make a prediction that I do think they'll announce
[39:46.160 --> 39:48.320]  the headset next month.
[39:49.040 --> 39:50.240]  I do think they'll show it.
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.080]  I think they will not tell us how much it costs because that's what they did that with
[39:56.080 --> 39:58.640]  the watch to people forget that.
[39:58.640 --> 40:06.240]  But we spent six months speculating and it's awesome for us because then we get all sorts
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.240]  of grist for our columns where we can.
[40:08.240 --> 40:08.560]  That's right.
[40:09.440 --> 40:09.840]  That's right.
[40:09.840 --> 40:12.000]  It's the ultimate now how much would you pay move, right?
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.120]  We're just like, here it is.
[40:13.760 --> 40:15.120]  And then they walk away, right?
[40:15.120 --> 40:16.960]  Later available later this year.
[40:17.920 --> 40:20.080]  And then they walk away and you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.440]  When and how much?
[40:22.480 --> 40:23.360]  No answer.
[40:23.360 --> 40:23.840]  No answer.
[40:23.840 --> 40:25.040]  Well, that would get away with it.
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.560]  I remember when I wrote like, Hey, I'm telling you this solid gold Apple watch.
[40:30.560 --> 40:32.240]  It's going to be like 15 to $20,000.
[40:33.200 --> 40:35.600]  And there were people who were like you out of your friggin mind.
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.040]  It's going to be out of date in a year.
[40:37.040 --> 40:38.720]  You know, how in the world could it cost that much?
[40:38.720 --> 40:40.320]  It'll be no more than $1,000.
[40:40.320 --> 40:42.080]  And I'm like, it's gold.
[40:42.640 --> 40:43.440]  It's Apple.
[40:43.440 --> 40:44.640]  Look at the way they're presenting it.
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.040]  I'm telling you 15 to $20,000.
[40:47.040 --> 40:48.800]  And yes, it'll be out of date in a year.
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.080]  I have to I have to take my being right point for that one.
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.360]  Yeah, for sure.
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.280]  So anyway, I think that'll, I think that'll happen.
[40:57.280 --> 41:03.440]  And I think it'll blow people's minds and it's going to waste all sorts of time in post
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.640]  keynote briefings where people in the media are going to be like, how much is this going
[41:08.640 --> 41:09.120]  to cost?
[41:09.120 --> 41:10.880]  And they'll say, we're not talking about that yet.
[41:10.880 --> 41:13.760]  And then they'll start talking about something and somebody will say, how much is it going
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.240]  to cost?
[41:15.920 --> 41:17.600]  And they'll say, we're not talking about that yet.
[41:17.600 --> 41:19.920]  And it'll go on and on and on and on.
[41:19.920 --> 41:24.000]  It's just in case if I keep asking, maybe they'll slip up and tell me exactly how much
[41:24.000 --> 41:24.800]  it'll cost.
[41:24.800 --> 41:25.120]  Right.
[41:25.120 --> 41:25.360]  Yeah.
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.640]  I should spend the whole 90 minutes of my show just asking over and over again, how
[41:30.640 --> 41:32.000]  much is the headset going to cost?
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.520]  How much is the headset going to cost?
[41:33.520 --> 41:34.880]  How much is the headset going to cost?
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.760]  Do each question like you're an analyst on the quarterly phone call and say like, Tim
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.120]  or whoever, executive, I got a question and also a follow up.
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.240]  And then you ask your question and you say, and also how much is it going to cost?
[41:46.240 --> 41:46.720]  Every time.
[41:47.360 --> 41:47.680]  Every time.
[41:47.680 --> 41:48.160]  See what happens.
[41:49.840 --> 41:53.840]  I could never, I used to think like years ago.
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.120]  I don't even listen to them anymore.
[41:55.120 --> 42:01.680]  And God bless you for transcribing them because I do read them, but my eyes glaze over even
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.480]  reading them.
[42:02.480 --> 42:08.400]  But when I used to listen to them, I used to think, wouldn't it be cool if they like
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.520]  expanded this and sort of went from analysts only to like sort of analysts and media.
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.120]  And so like me and you and Joanna Stern and Neelai could get in on these things.
[42:19.120 --> 42:20.720]  I realize now that's not going to happen.
[42:20.720 --> 42:22.880]  This really is just for Wall Street.
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.040]  But it's like, there is it's such a different universe.
[42:27.040 --> 42:28.560]  I don't know how to speak like that.
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.160]  I also honestly, sometimes I don't even understand what they're asking.
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.640]  And I think, how the hell are they going to answer that?
[42:34.640 --> 42:40.640]  But like Tim Cook and Luca, they speak the language and they seem to understand.
[42:40.640 --> 42:46.240]  It is to me, Luca, if we could, if we could burrow in a little bit more into OpEx, we're
[42:46.240 --> 42:48.320]  looking at the second quarter, pull forward.
[42:48.320 --> 42:55.040]  Are you, can you give me a little more color on where the OI and E may land given the headwinds
[42:55.600 --> 42:58.560]  and like, okay, all right, good luck with that one.
[42:59.360 --> 43:00.800]  Well, we might circle back.
[43:00.800 --> 43:01.520]  I've learned a lot.
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.800]  I actually have learned a lot about business speak by writing about and transcribing those
[43:06.800 --> 43:07.120]  things.
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.840]  Cause as a kid, I would always read whenever we would get the, the San Francisco Chronicle,
[43:11.840 --> 43:13.600]  I'd like tear into the sports section.
[43:13.600 --> 43:16.720]  I'd get to the business section and just be like, who wants this?
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.760]  Take it away from me.
[43:17.760 --> 43:23.920]  And now I'm, you know, sitting there writing down, Oh, well, the pull forward sales from
[43:23.920 --> 43:25.360]  the previous fiscal quarter.
[43:25.920 --> 43:27.520]  How does that affect the OI and E?
[43:31.120 --> 43:32.640]  It's not as good as it once was.
[43:32.640 --> 43:34.160]  They're much more locked down with that, by the way.
[43:34.160 --> 43:35.520]  I mean, there's less to glean.
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.600]  There's still bits to glean from it every so often, but like it's an hour long call
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.200]  and I'd say a half hour of it now is just prepared statement.
[43:43.200 --> 43:47.520]  And it used to be the statements were much shorter and there were way more questions
[43:47.520 --> 43:48.480]  and answers.
[43:48.480 --> 43:52.560]  And now the questions that not only are the answers to the questions really locked down
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.080]  in, I mean, literally scripted.
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.440]  Sometimes I will hear a question and you can hear a piece of paper.
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.680]  Tim Cook is literally picking up a piece of paper to read the answer that they said they
[44:01.680 --> 44:04.480]  would give if this was a question that was asked.
[44:04.480 --> 44:08.160]  And so it's, it's yeah, there's a lot less there than was there like five or 10 years
[44:08.160 --> 44:08.400]  ago.
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.760]  They're much more controlled about it.
[44:10.480 --> 44:10.800]  Yeah.
[44:10.800 --> 44:13.200]  The prepared statements have definitely crept up.
[44:13.200 --> 44:14.240]  They're a snooze.
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.560]  At one point I asked somebody investor relations, like, can you just give us those?
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.400]  Cause they're just reading it off a piece of paper.
[44:20.400 --> 44:23.440]  Why am I transcribing a prepared statement?
[44:23.440 --> 44:24.880]  Just, just put it out.
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.000]  Like why give it to the press who asked for it?
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.600]  And they're like, no, we're not going to do that.
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.360]  But it's, yeah, they're, they're, there's stuff to be gleaned from it.
[44:33.360 --> 44:36.800]  But if you want to understand Apple's business, but it's a snooze, you're not missing that
[44:36.800 --> 44:37.040]  much.
[44:37.040 --> 44:44.800]  I am reminded of that though, because that they used to be periodically more exciting.
[44:44.800 --> 44:50.480]  Cause I wrote this week there was a wall street journal story about the headset that what
[44:50.480 --> 44:58.000]  set me off was there sort of insinuation that it might be a flop because the, all the headsets
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.840]  extant to date have been flops or, or if not flops, haven't set the world on fire.
[45:03.840 --> 45:07.840]  And Apple standard is obviously setting the world on fire to some extent.
[45:07.840 --> 45:08.320]  Right?
[45:08.320 --> 45:14.880]  So like however successful Facebook's headsets have been to date and they're not flops, right?
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.600]  They're out there.
[45:15.600 --> 45:20.320]  I mean, and there's content and some, some number of people have them, but if Apple's
[45:20.320 --> 45:27.120]  only sells in the quantities Facebook's have and, and have people talking about them to
[45:27.120 --> 45:31.440]  the degree, I mean, that that's going to, it's going to go down as a flop, but they,
[45:31.440 --> 45:37.520]  but the, the thing that set me off was there an insinuation that, that the iPhone and Apple
[45:37.520 --> 45:40.080]  watch were immediate hits.
[45:40.080 --> 45:40.480]  Oh yeah.
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.480]  Because they weren't the, and nothing ever is.
[45:45.280 --> 45:46.400]  The iPod wasn't either.
[45:46.400 --> 45:52.720]  Remember none of them were, none of them were, the iPod was a Mac only firewire only peripheral
[45:52.720 --> 45:58.240]  that might've been a hit to some extent within the Mac market, but the Mac market was at
[45:58.240 --> 46:05.440]  that time at its lowest point market share wise, I I'm trying to iPad even, I mean, maybe
[46:05.440 --> 46:10.080]  iPad is the first one that was kind of instant semi-hit.
[46:10.720 --> 46:15.440]  iPad took off and then, and then crashed right a few years later, but that was partially
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.280]  cause it was just primed by the iPhone, but the iPhone itself took a while.
[46:19.280 --> 46:24.400]  The Apple watch certainly took a while and, and, and yeah, we that's, there's a lot of
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.560]  that, right? Where it's like, Oh, well obviously it's going to be like it was in the past.
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.240]  And you're like, that was not what it was like.
[46:30.240 --> 46:30.480]  Yeah.
[46:30.480 --> 46:34.800]  And I, and I really, and I don't mean this to be dismissive and we'll come back to iPad.
[46:34.800 --> 46:39.440]  That's a sure thing on the future agenda of this episode of the show, but I don't mean
[46:39.440 --> 46:45.600]  to be dismissive to the iPad, but that's an, the iPad, if it qualifies as an instant hit
[46:45.600 --> 46:48.320]  was because it was just a big iPhone.
[46:48.320 --> 46:48.880]  Right.
[46:48.880 --> 46:53.920]  And we've all talked about this many times where the number one criticism of the iPod
[46:53.920 --> 46:57.120]  when it was announced was, Oh, it's just a big iPhone.
[46:57.120 --> 47:01.200]  And the number one reason people loved it and wanted to buy it right away was people
[47:01.200 --> 47:03.120]  who said, Oh my God, it's a big iPhone.
[47:03.120 --> 47:03.520]  Yes.
[47:03.520 --> 47:04.080]  Give me that.
[47:04.080 --> 47:04.880]  They got it.
[47:04.880 --> 47:05.200]  Yeah.
[47:05.200 --> 47:05.440]  Yeah.
[47:05.440 --> 47:10.720]  The, the iPad was understandable because it had been primed because of the iPhone in a
[47:10.720 --> 47:14.960]  way that, that the iPhone didn't happen and the Apple watch didn't happen that way.
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.800]  And the iPod didn't happen that way.
[47:16.800 --> 47:17.040]  Right.
[47:17.040 --> 47:21.520]  And the, there, there's a guy named he doesn't really seem to blog anymore.
[47:21.520 --> 47:22.560]  A young, young guy.
[47:22.560 --> 47:23.280]  I actually know him.
[47:23.280 --> 47:24.720]  He used to live in Philadelphia.
[47:24.720 --> 47:29.520]  A nice guy named Matt Richmond, but he used to track iPhone sales and, and was to me the
[47:29.520 --> 47:32.800]  first person to observe that the.
[47:34.320 --> 47:38.800]  The iPhone three G, which was the second iPhone sold more than the first iPhone.
[47:38.800 --> 47:44.800]  The three GS sold more than the first two combined the iPhone four sold more than the
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.240]  first three combined.
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.280]  Like their growth for the first few years was such that each successive model sold more
[47:51.280 --> 47:54.480]  than all of the previous ones combined, like it.
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.040]  And then all of a sudden you get to the point where everybody, you know, has an iPhone and
[48:01.040 --> 48:06.400]  in every, the back of everybody's minds, it was an instant hit, but it really wasn't.
[48:06.400 --> 48:10.160]  And I think that's always the case with the new platforms.
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.160]  And in, in that context, the iPad really wasn't a new platform.
[48:14.160 --> 48:18.160]  It was coming in at the point where the iPhone three GS, I think was already out.
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.160]  And yeah, seven 2007, 2008, two days.
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.960]  So it was the early, the beginning of the year when the iPhone four would eventually
[48:26.960 --> 48:27.680]  come out.
[48:27.680 --> 48:32.880]  So the iPhone had taken off and there was a huge market primed for something bigger
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.480]  than a 3.5 inch screen running this sort of software.
[48:37.040 --> 48:39.200]  Whereas the headset is like nothing else.
[48:39.200 --> 48:42.000]  Apple sells the watch was like nothing else.
[48:42.000 --> 48:42.960]  Apple sells you.
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.040]  Nobody looked at their Apple watch and said, Oh, it's like a tiny iPhone on my wrist.
[48:47.040 --> 48:49.600]  No, that's not what the Apple watch is like at all.
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.080]  It's one of those cases where with this VR stuff, cause I have a meta quest too, which
[48:54.080 --> 48:56.880]  is probably the best selling VR headset ever.
[48:56.880 --> 48:57.440]  I don't know.
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.160]  It's more than 10 million units, more than half of the headsets that meta has sold are
[49:02.160 --> 49:02.880]  the quest too.
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.560]  And it's fun.
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.440]  There's fun stuff on it, but like it, the challenge with any of this stuff is that you
[49:09.440 --> 49:11.600]  got to basically, you got to wear it.
[49:11.600 --> 49:17.120]  You got to have it on your face and see it for yourself before you even can understand
[49:17.120 --> 49:17.680]  it.
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.320]  And I don't know how Apple's going to handle this in terms of retail, but at least they
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.800]  have retail where they could theoretically do like a demo model or something that can
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.680]  fairly easily go on somebody's head and give them a very basic demo experience of it.
[49:31.680 --> 49:38.080]  Cause like, I think that's the biggest challenge with VR is you could understand it in the
[49:38.080 --> 49:40.480]  abstract, but it's not the same as experiencing it.
[49:40.480 --> 49:45.600]  And if they truly have a world-class experience with this thing, their challenge is going
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.120]  to be, how do I let people experience that?
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.240]  And are there going to be a little try on areas or try on booths or something at Apple
[49:54.240 --> 49:54.640]  retail?
[49:54.640 --> 49:56.400]  Cause that's kind of what they need to do.
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.120]  Yeah.
[49:57.120 --> 49:59.200]  I guess metas is probably the best selling one.
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.360]  The only one I could think of that might be more better selling would be Sony's for the
[50:03.360 --> 50:05.040]  PlayStation, which is tethered.
[50:05.040 --> 50:05.440]  Yeah.
[50:05.440 --> 50:07.680]  Although that's not really a standalone, but yeah, you're right.
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.640]  PSVR might be a bigger thing, but it's it's a console with a, with a headset attached
[50:12.640 --> 50:12.960]  to it.
[50:12.960 --> 50:15.200]  It's not quite, I have the PSVR.
[50:15.840 --> 50:19.600]  That was my first headset was the PSVR and the PSVR too.
[50:19.600 --> 50:22.240]  I don't have, but I, I, it sounds like it's a lot better.
[50:22.240 --> 50:26.480]  PSVR it's tethered and it was fun, but also terrible.
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.440]  And the advantage of something like the quest two is that it is all in one.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.080]  It's on your head.
[50:32.080 --> 50:37.920]  You don't, you don't have like cables running across the room into your PlayStation where
[50:37.920 --> 50:39.120]  people can trip on them.
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.920]  And that totally happened with my PSVR.
[50:41.920 --> 50:42.800]  So, all right.
[50:42.800 --> 50:49.280]  So I just checked in with the official VR slash gaming correspondent for daring fireball
[50:49.280 --> 50:50.240]  and the talk show.
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.760]  My son, Jonas, he took his PlayStation to college this year.
[50:55.760 --> 50:57.040]  He's back now.
[50:57.040 --> 50:58.320]  So we've got him back in the house.
[50:58.320 --> 50:58.640]  I don't know.
[50:58.640 --> 51:00.240]  Do you have, do you have yours back in the house yet?
[51:00.240 --> 51:04.960]  Or no quarter system we've got a month before we get him back in the house.
[51:04.960 --> 51:05.920]  I know, I know it.
[51:05.920 --> 51:07.840]  Well, I went to Drexel quarters.
[51:07.840 --> 51:08.160]  Yeah.
[51:08.160 --> 51:10.480]  Well, Jonas is back, but I just double checked.
[51:10.480 --> 51:15.040]  So he took his PlayStation, did not take his gaming PC for space considerations.
[51:15.040 --> 51:20.320]  His dorm room, which he shared with a roommate was about the size of like a Yugo.
[51:21.360 --> 51:24.720]  I mean the interior cabin of a Yugo, not the whole car.
[51:25.360 --> 51:26.560]  He took his PlayStation.
[51:26.560 --> 51:28.880]  I just asked, did you take your VR headset?
[51:28.880 --> 51:30.240]  And he says, nah, no way.
[51:30.240 --> 51:31.040]  I left that at home.
[51:31.760 --> 51:34.560]  So glad I bought it for him first.
[51:34.560 --> 51:41.360]  First of all, money well spent on that headset, but if he didn't take it, how, how important
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.680]  it is to the PlayStation lifestyle.
[51:43.680 --> 51:43.920]  Yeah.
[51:43.920 --> 51:46.880]  I guess the other thing before we dropped the headset and move on to other stuff is
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.800]  I guess the thing I'm most excited about, and I'm sure you share my enthusiasm and tremendous
[51:52.800 --> 52:01.200]  curiosity is not this specific headsets hardware, which is going to be the worst one Apple ever
[52:01.200 --> 52:01.520]  makes.
[52:01.520 --> 52:01.840]  Right.
[52:01.840 --> 52:03.520]  Well, I mean, it may not be right.
[52:03.520 --> 52:06.480]  Like there may be a cheap version that is, that is worse than this.
[52:06.480 --> 52:07.440]  Yeah, maybe.
[52:07.440 --> 52:09.680]  Well, but there'll probably be a pro version too.
[52:09.680 --> 52:10.160]  Right.
[52:10.160 --> 52:10.960]  I don't know though.
[52:10.960 --> 52:15.760]  I think it'd be more like the watch though, where even with the watch, they came out with
[52:15.760 --> 52:16.400]  the series.
[52:16.960 --> 52:17.600]  What do they call it?
[52:17.600 --> 52:18.880]  The series one, right?
[52:18.880 --> 52:23.680]  The series two was the second generation, but they actually stopped selling the original
[52:23.680 --> 52:27.360]  and sold the series one because they actually were able to make the battery better.
[52:27.360 --> 52:32.160]  And I was about to say the worst iPhone ever was the original, but there is something charming
[52:32.160 --> 52:33.680]  about the aluminum back, right?
[52:33.680 --> 52:40.240]  It was like, like we upgraded from terrible edge cellular to the much, much, literally
[52:41.200 --> 52:47.040]  a hundred times better 3g networking, but we downgraded on the hand feel, right?
[52:47.040 --> 52:51.600]  It was like, it was a very nice aluminum product, the original.
[52:51.600 --> 52:56.560]  And the second one was sort of a, not, not cheap, but yeah, it's a big bulbous plastic
[52:56.560 --> 52:56.800]  back.
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.320]  It was not nearly as classy.
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.640]  They, well, it was probably cheaper to make and felt a little bit cheaper.
[53:02.640 --> 53:09.680]  The, the designed by Apple in California coffee table book celebrating the Johnny Ive era
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.200]  had several photographs of the original iPhone.
[53:13.200 --> 53:15.600]  I don't believe it had any iPhone three G's.
[53:16.320 --> 53:16.800]  Yeah.
[53:16.800 --> 53:21.520]  So, but what are you excited about?
[53:21.520 --> 53:30.880]  I'm excited at the, basically the sounds out there or, or, or touchy feely, but the
[53:30.880 --> 53:34.880]  paradigm for the software interface.
[53:36.080 --> 53:37.280]  Oh, interesting.
[53:37.280 --> 53:37.520]  Yeah.
[53:37.520 --> 53:37.680]  Right.
[53:38.400 --> 53:43.360]  Cause that to me is what these breakthroughs that Apple has come up with.
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.080]  And there, again, I would hark back to Steve jobs with the iPhone, that there are very
[53:48.080 --> 53:54.320]  few times that, that something like this happens, but that's, that's what the Macintosh in
[53:54.320 --> 54:00.880]  1984, the original Macintosh hardware was the worst Mac ever made without question.
[54:01.440 --> 54:04.240]  Like I said, 128 kilobytes of Ram.
[54:04.240 --> 54:07.440]  I mean, that is, that was really, really rough.
[54:07.440 --> 54:14.720]  I mean, but what they had was the paradigm for how personal computing should look going
[54:14.720 --> 54:15.120]  forward.
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.520]  We're literally still using it to this day.
[54:17.520 --> 54:22.080]  Like the somebody familiar with today's Mac, they might be surprised by many of the
[54:22.080 --> 54:24.480]  limitations on that Mac, but they'd know how to use it.
[54:25.040 --> 54:29.200]  The iPhone really changed the way we use cell phones.
[54:29.200 --> 54:33.760]  I mean, they used to just be, just keep adding buttons, add a whole keyboard, put a red
[54:33.760 --> 54:37.600]  button for phone calls and a green or green one for phone calls and a red one to hang
[54:37.600 --> 54:37.840]  up.
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.760]  And I mean, two buttons just for phone calls, two whole buttons, hardware buttons, the
[54:43.760 --> 54:45.120]  whole paradigm changed.
[54:45.120 --> 54:51.680]  And with VR, I mean, do you, do you have sticks in your hand that you you put one in
[54:51.680 --> 54:53.840]  one hand and one in the other, and that's how you use your hand?
[54:53.840 --> 54:55.840]  Well, of course not with Apple's thing, right?
[54:55.840 --> 55:00.480]  They're not going to give you, I be flabbergasted and none of the rumors suggested that
[55:00.480 --> 55:04.640]  you're supposed to use it while holding whatever you call those sticks that you have
[55:04.640 --> 55:08.080]  with other VR headsets, controllers, basically.
[55:08.080 --> 55:09.840]  But what is the interface?
[55:09.840 --> 55:12.080]  What are the rules of what you see?
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.120]  Are there going to be windows that float in the air?
[55:15.120 --> 55:18.400]  Do you poke at them with your finger in the air in front of your face?
[55:18.400 --> 55:20.480]  Do you see your hands when you're doing it?
[55:20.480 --> 55:21.360]  What do you do?
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.360]  One of the rumors is that there's going to be like a little dial, sort of like a digital
[55:25.360 --> 55:33.760]  crown on the headset that you turn to sort of dial between AR and VR, meaning you turn
[55:33.760 --> 55:38.400]  it all the way to one end and you no longer see any of the world around you.
[55:38.400 --> 55:42.560]  You're completely engrossed in the VR.
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.840]  Turn it the other way and you're in AR mode where your camera's looking forward, show
[55:47.840 --> 55:49.840]  you what the world around you looks like.
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.560]  And there's some kind of things in front of you, but are they windows?
[55:54.560 --> 55:56.640]  Are they more like widgets?
[55:56.640 --> 55:58.720]  Is it, can you actually type?
[55:59.520 --> 56:01.120]  Can you, what are there?
[56:01.120 --> 56:02.000]  Are there gestures?
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.680]  Are you doing like meta?
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.400]  They have like various, like you tap your fingers together or you make a hand gesture
[56:08.400 --> 56:12.720]  and like, so you can have this combination assuming that it's all hand tracking, which
[56:12.720 --> 56:14.720]  it sounds like it's going to be based on the reports.
[56:15.360 --> 56:15.680]  Yeah.
[56:15.680 --> 56:18.800]  And what is that gestural language and how does it work and how quickly can you learn
[56:18.800 --> 56:20.240]  it and how natural does it feel?
[56:20.240 --> 56:22.560]  And, and yeah, how, how is everything represented?
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.160]  There's a lot of talk that like, it'll run iPad apps and iPhone apps.
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.600]  You'll just be able to run those and, and okay.
[56:29.600 --> 56:31.600]  And do screen sharing with a Mac.
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.840]  So not run Mac apps, but connect to a Mac.
[56:34.400 --> 56:34.720]  Okay.
[56:34.720 --> 56:35.840]  Well, what does that look like?
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.120]  What is, what is working with a touchscreen app look like?
[56:39.120 --> 56:44.160]  And what is working with an app that needs a mouse and a keyboard look like, and how
[56:44.160 --> 56:47.280]  does that translate if, if that's a thing you actually want people to do?
[56:48.000 --> 56:48.880]  Fascinating, right?
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.440]  Because like, that's where the hard work, that's where the hardest work goes in on
[56:53.440 --> 56:54.160]  the hardware side.
[56:54.160 --> 56:57.280]  Look, it's going to be an impressive piece of hardware, but like on the software side,
[56:57.920 --> 56:59.520]  it's not just the work of building it.
[56:59.520 --> 57:05.600]  It's the work of conceiving it and testing it and saying like, we think this metaphor
[57:05.600 --> 57:11.280]  is something that people will understand, learn and integrate so that it's like second
[57:11.280 --> 57:13.120]  nature because it is body language.
[57:13.120 --> 57:14.400]  You're essentially going to have to learn.
[57:14.960 --> 57:18.800]  And there's no, I mean, there, there are, there are metaphors, right?
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.440]  Just like the desktop metaphor, but in the end, you got to make a decision and there's
[57:23.440 --> 57:25.840]  no like one clear, right decision.
[57:25.840 --> 57:26.400]  I would argue.
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.000]  It's like, you just got to try them all out and have the arguments with everybody you're
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.040]  working with and say, do I want to have my fingers pop open or pop closed or tap two
[57:35.040 --> 57:39.200]  together or hold it or make a fist or like tap two hands together?
[57:39.200 --> 57:40.800]  Who knows what those are.
[57:40.800 --> 57:42.160]  And that's years.
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.000]  And that I am sure that people inside Apple had been working on that stuff.
[57:46.000 --> 57:52.320]  And I can't wait to see what all those people have spent all this time to come to a conclusion.
[57:52.320 --> 57:53.680]  What is that conclusion?
[57:53.680 --> 57:54.240]  Right.
[57:54.240 --> 57:59.280]  How do you know when, all right, so you are, let's just say it runs iPhone apps and you
[57:59.280 --> 58:03.520]  you've got the headset on and you see an iPhone app right in front of your face.
[58:03.520 --> 58:04.160]  It's right there.
[58:04.160 --> 58:06.960]  You see it and you put your finger in front of it.
[58:06.960 --> 58:09.520]  How do you know when you've tapped on the thing?
[58:09.520 --> 58:09.840]  Right?
[58:09.840 --> 58:15.200]  Like it sounds silly, but when you start thinking about these details, you realize how many
[58:15.200 --> 58:19.360]  thousand little things when you have an actual iPhone in front of your face, you know, when
[58:19.360 --> 58:24.640]  your finger has touched the thing on screen because your finger feels glass, right?
[58:24.640 --> 58:30.960]  I mean, there's actual tactile feedback, haptics aside, haptic feedback aside, there's the
[58:31.520 --> 58:38.240]  just finger on glass and finger isn't quite, you know, when your fingers only a 16th of
[58:38.240 --> 58:40.560]  an inch away because you don't feel the glass yet.
[58:40.560 --> 58:44.000]  How do you do that when it's a virtual thing in front of you?
[58:44.000 --> 58:44.560]  I don't know.
[58:44.560 --> 58:45.520]  I'm fascinated.
[58:45.520 --> 58:50.880]  I, I, this is why I like writing about this stuff and not, I'm not working at Apple, creating
[58:50.880 --> 58:54.960]  it because I have zero idea how to solve problems like that.
[58:54.960 --> 58:55.680]  None.
[58:55.680 --> 59:00.640]  And I can't, can't wait to see what somebody else thinks is the answer.
[59:00.640 --> 59:01.520]  It is really.
[59:01.520 --> 59:01.840]  Yeah.
[59:01.840 --> 59:02.080]  Right.
[59:02.080 --> 59:06.720]  Because it's, I think some very smart people have had to wrestle with this for a long time
[59:06.720 --> 59:10.000]  and they've come to some conclusions and it will be amazing to see that.
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.920]  And then for us all to kind of go through that experience and then give our feelings
[59:13.920 --> 59:16.560]  about like, did they nail it or is it a little weird or whatever?
[59:16.560 --> 59:20.560]  Because nothing is perfect, but I'm interested to see what their take is.
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.080]  That was a great example.
[59:22.080 --> 59:26.400]  The one that I've been thinking of that I thought you might be interested in too, is
[59:27.200 --> 59:30.800]  I know you're a big fan of sports and movies.
[59:30.800 --> 59:35.840]  And today a newsletter that I get, there's a guy I know who's been a baseball writer
[59:35.840 --> 59:36.400]  for years.
[59:36.400 --> 59:37.840]  He writes about injuries.
[59:37.840 --> 59:40.000]  His name is Will Carroll.
[59:40.000 --> 59:44.800]  He has a sub stack under the knife and he worked at baseball prospectus way back when.
[59:44.800 --> 59:46.800]  And his piece today was basically.
[59:48.400 --> 59:52.640]  Apple and Apple and baseball and VR and how it could be a match made in heaven.
[59:52.640 --> 59:54.320]  And he talks about the MLS deal.
[59:54.320 --> 01:00:00.880]  He talks about meta, has a deal with the NBA and, and he talks about VR sports, like to
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:06.320]  watch and be immersive in like your court side or to play the baseball actually with
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:12.400]  hand tracking and stuff is actually perfect for even training pitchers and hitters VR.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.080]  They do it now there's VR baseball hitting training now available for like kids, not
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.360]  even just major league players.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.760]  And then I'll throw movies into that too.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.880]  I have watched movies on the Oculus quest.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:31.600]  And although the quality of the picture is bad, I will say a 3d movie is actually decent
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.160]  on a headset because it's not unlike in a movie theater where everything is about half
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.200]  brightness.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.840]  It is like a perfectly kind of native quote unquote into your eyes with the left field
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.880]  and the right field.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.240]  And I think about share play and watching a movie that's like a proper 3d movie on a
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.080]  very high resolution screen.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.480]  Or I think about something that's got immersive audio and video that is at a sporting event
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.520]  and.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.920]  Apple's connections and strengthen the market means they can make those deals for that kind
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.800]  of content.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.320]  And I would expect to see 3d movies and immersive video and immersive sports stuff happen for
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.600]  this platform, if not this year, then in the next year.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:17.200]  And I'm excited about that just because I think in, I, I think that there might be an
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.600]  audience for people watching a really good movie with their friends.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.600]  Using something like share play, I maybe, maybe not, right.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.160]  This is one of those things where you got to try it and see if anybody actually likes
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.240]  it or not, but there might be something there.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:35.840]  So it's another thing worth watching is like, what is the entertainment, the immersive entertainment
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.480]  aspect of this?
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:44.080]  I don't think it's entirely outlandish that the entertainment aspect aspect, if done well
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.360]  and taken to the next level could be perhaps the number one reason to buy the thing, even
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.680]  if it is $3,000, people buy $3,000 entertainment devices or, or more, right?
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.840]  I mean, it's, yes, it's out of many budgets, but it may not be.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.120]  And I'm, I'm with you on that.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:10.000]  And there is something to, and even if it's not a 3d movie, even if it's just like simulating
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.840]  like a giant IMAX sort of screen, right?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.800]  Like there's, there's a certain, yeah.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.720]  That's what the apps are like on the, on the meta quest is it's not like there's just the
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.760]  movies floating in space.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.040]  You're in a movie theater, right?
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.080]  And, and there is something about that.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.680]  I'm a huge fan of both feature films and I do like going to movie theaters.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.560]  And even though I like going to movie theaters, I, every single year I go to them less and
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.200]  less frequently COVID aside, right?
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.200]  Not even factoring that in.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.040]  It's really just more and more just for 10, 10 polls.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:52.560]  Style movies, James Bond or the Avengers star Wars, really, really big movies that I definitely
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.320]  want to see in a theater.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:00.480]  But every time I do, I always think I should come to the movies more often because it is
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.720]  more immersive and there's a certain.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:13.040]  You have to get outside your cerebral head and just accept the fact that we're not having
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:19.440]  just accept the fact that we're not entirely intellectual beings and that there is something
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:25.920]  on spiring about seeing a person's face in a closeup and knowing that it's 40 feet tall,
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.240]  right?
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.600]  Like it, no matter how nice your TV is at home.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.160]  And I splurged and got a, forget how big my LG OLED is.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.880]  It's whatever their biggest OLED was three or four years ago.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:37.280]  I don't know.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.920]  It's very large and I'm very happy with it.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.840]  But the biggest anything can get is, I don't know, 80 inches.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.560]  I think it is.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.640]  That's the biggest anything can possibly get on it is 80 inches, which isn't that big.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:54.560]  Whereas you go to a real movie theater and things look huge because they are huge, right?
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.920]  It's actually if you took a tape measure out, it's measured in yards.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.800]  It's dozens of feet big.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.000]  It's humongous.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.440]  It's all inspiring.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.920]  I'll never forget my childhood canonical moment going to the Star Wars with my dad.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.960]  And he had no idea what it was.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.000]  Knew I wanted to see it.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.960]  I think he thought it was like Flash Gordon from the 50s.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.080]  And sure, I'll take my kindergarten kid to the see the space laser thing.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.600]  And the movie opens up with the Star Destroyer coming over the screen.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.280]  I remember my I'll never forget it.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.080]  I vividly remember that he was to my left.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.280]  I was to his right.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.560]  And he put his hand on my knee and he just said, wow.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.160]  And I was like, my dad's amazed, right?
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.080]  And I was like, holy cow, my dad's never amazed by stuff like this because it was huge, right?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.280]  It's just big.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.400]  And you can see me.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.720]  I think that you will be able to simulate that in a headset in a way that it will be.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.080]  And just think about it.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.280]  All of a sudden, watching a movie on a plane could actually be one of the best ways to
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.840]  enjoy a movie because you're going to have an entirely immersive visual experience where
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:10.320]  it looks humongous with AirPods or I guess I'm presuming that the headset has built in
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:10.800]  headphones.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:17.360]  It seems to me if it's $3,000, you shouldn't need to bring your own headphones, but presumably
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.200]  there'll be AirPods quality in terms of noise cancellation and stuff like that.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.760]  You could have like a truly immersive movie watching experience on an airplane as opposed
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.840]  to watching it on an iPad or even a phone propped up on the tray in front of your lap,
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.160]  right?
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.960]  I mean, which I do.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.800]  I mean, you got to do something on a plane.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.920]  And the sports thing, I'm interested in that too.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:47.120]  And I don't think it's a coincidence that Apple is obviously more interested in sports
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.680]  rights than ever before or is showing they were fishing around for the NFL rights, which
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.480]  are the crown jewels here in the United States.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.720]  They've got a second year of baseball.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:03.760]  They've taken the entirety of the MLB or not MLB, the soccer.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.000]  What's the MLS MLS?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.320]  Yeah.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.720]  And they're rumored to be discussing the one outstanding college football contract that's
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.120]  out there.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:11.760]  Oh, right.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.560]  Well, right.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.080]  It's a rumor that Apple and Amazon are basically bidding on those now too.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.400]  So Apple might be in college football and college sports as well.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.640]  I think they're experimenting, but I look at this headset thing and I think, oh, sports
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.960]  rights make total sense for this.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.560]  Cause I think there are, and it's not necessarily just NBA court side kind of stuff, but it's
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.520]  also just immersive, like best seen in the house where you feel that the speed of that
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.480]  fastball or if there's technology that lets you extrapolate like you're out on the field
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.040]  or whatever.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.880]  I don't know what else is out there.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:52.000]  Apple bought a company that specializes in 360, I think sports stuff and took them inside
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.760]  several years ago and not never to be seen again, but like, I think that's clearly part
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.320]  of the strategy.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.160]  And I don't know, again, some of that's just going to be super gimmicky, but isn't that
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.320]  to go back to the idea of you got to get it out there, you got to ship it and see, I think
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.520]  you have five big sports ideas involving the headset.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.800]  And if you can find two that work great, drop the other three.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.000]  But like, I there's gotta be, I think something out there for that full immersive experience.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.200]  I think that would be pretty cool.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:25.200]  I was at a briefing last month in New York for the Friday night baseball, and I guess
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.000]  it's off the record.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.920]  So I can't, I'm not supposed to say no Apple says no retribution, but there were, it was
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.800]  very, it was different when there was one last year too, but this year was different
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.160]  that I guess because I forget, I don't even know why, but there were actual members of
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.840]  the broadcast team who were there.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.720]  Wayne Randazzo, the play by play guy was there.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.040]  A couple of people were there and then one of the new producer who was brought in after
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.360]  last year, or maybe he was there last year, but I think last year's was not as good as
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:59.040]  they wanted it to be because of the lockout before the season started and that they couldn't
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.000]  get started.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.720]  But the one thing that knowing that this headset was coming up was when they were talking about
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.320]  the drone camera that they have that comes out like between innings and the camera actually
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.040]  gets like around the pitcher's mound while the pitcher's throwing his last warm-up pitches.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.920]  And it really is an innovative perspective.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.600]  I mean, you and I, here we are talking baseball, but we've been watching baseball on TV for
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.080]  a long time.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.800]  And while the resolution's gotten better and the cameras have gotten better, the angles
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.240]  haven't changed, right?
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.680]  It's just higher resolution.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.640]  Centerfield camera.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.240]  Yes, centerfield camera.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.320]  Maybe there are more cameras now and the slow motion is better and they put on the pitch
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.280]  tracking and all of that.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.960]  But yeah, there's that moment where you see that drone shot and you're like, whoa, I've
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.920]  never seen that ballpark from that angle or been right behind the pitcher when he's warming
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.160]  up and like, yeah, that's really cool stuff.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.360]  Yeah, it's and it just made me think VR, right?
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.800]  Like, oh, that would be really cool.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.440]  Like, hey, what do you what do you see before the inning starts?
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.800]  And it's like, oh, it'd be it'd be why like, maybe you're you get to pick.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.160]  I mean, again, I'm spitballing here.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:05.840]  I have no idea what's technically possible in the near term future, but you could pick
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840]  like, do you want to be sitting behind home plate?
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.200]  Do you want to be sitting at third base?
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:16.800]  I think baseball in particular could really do well with it because baseball is cinematically
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.920]  a very weird sport to broadcast because like, all right, let's let's compare and contrast
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:30.880]  with the hockey, soccer, even soccer, but hockey and basketball, like the arena games
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:38.960]  the arena games where you just have a camera at halfway on the court or the rink, as it
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.320]  were in hockey, and it just pans back and forth, right?
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.920]  And the ball goes over there.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.760]  And then it starts going the other way in the camera pans.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.880]  And it's just sort of simulating a seat at halfway and halfway up.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.940]  Whereas baseball has to cut all the time, right?
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:01.800]  The center field camera is showing that from over the way out in center field over the
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.240]  pitcher's shoulder is showing the pitch come in.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:11.360]  And then if the batter hits the ball, they cut to a camera from sort of behind home plate
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.020]  showing the fielders.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:21.040]  And if the ball goes to the outfield, and it's a fly ball, then all you see is say the
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.520]  center fielder trying to catch the ball, but you have no idea what's going on on the bases,
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.600]  right?
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.860]  You can't see any of that.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:36.340]  The field is too big and the ball instantly, unlike any other sport, the ball goes from
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:41.040]  home plate to 400 feet away in a second.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.520]  No other sport is like that.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.520]  I mean, or team sport that I can think of, even football just sort of pans back and forth.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.440]  Those cinematic cuts take you out of it.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.120]  I find sitting in a ballpark watching a game so much more immersive.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.140]  Even though you can't see details like you can on TV, right?
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:07.080]  From wherever your seat is in the ballpark, maybe you're out in the outfield ready to
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.400]  catch a home run ball where you obviously can't see close up details of the batter at
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  home plate, but you see everything going on.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.800]  And so like if the batter hits a fly ball to the outfield, you don't have to wait for
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.480]  him to catch it.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.580]  You can instantly go and look at the guy at third base to see if he's going to tag up
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.240]  and run, right?
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.560]  You get to choose.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.400]  I think that baseball in particular could do very, very well with VR.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  I think it could be incredibly immersive and it really would be suited to it.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.120]  Is that related to the fact that baseball is one of the first sports that Apple bid
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.880]  on to get the rights to?
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.360]  I don't know, but I don't think it hurts.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.560]  I hear what you're saying, I mean, I like to sit.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:56.620]  Most of the tickets I buy tend to be in the upper deck at Oracle Park behind home plate.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.960]  That's a good seat.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.120]  And it's a great seat because the view is beautiful.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.480]  You can see the Bay, you can see all the way over to Oakland and all of that.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:08.080]  But also the, what you just said, which is when things are in play, you get to pick out
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.360]  like, Oh, that's going to be caught because I could see where the outfielders are running.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.400]  Now let's look at the infield.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.400]  Let's look at this guy.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400]  Is he going to tag?
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.720]  And you are your own director in that scenario and that's kind of fun.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.140]  So although I, you know, being a courtside at an NBA game too, would probably impress
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:29.600]  upon you the physicality of the game in a way that the cameras that are up in the rafters
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.920]  or up on the second level don't do.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.360]  So there may be some of that too, like, yeah, I mean, sports, it's just a very, anybody
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.480]  who's attended a sporting event and watched a sporting event on television knows those
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.680]  are both really different experiences.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:51.880]  And probably if VR could give you more of the attendance feeling, and that would be
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.240]  different from just watching it on TV, maybe I did.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.160]  I can vouch for this because I haven't been to an NBA game in quite a few years, but I
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.360]  went to game six of the Sixers Celtics, in my opinion, ill-fated series with my wife
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.360]  and son.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.920]  Is that the one where TNT flew the drone around inside?
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.760]  No, I didn't see it.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:19.300]  No, no, no, game two, game two, they had a drone inside and like it was flying in front
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:20.300]  of the cameras.
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.680]  It's like, what are you doing?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.760]  No, I actually, I know it was on ESPN because, and I splurged for, I splurged for very good
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.120]  seats, not quite courtside, but very good near courtside seats.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.280]  And there was a moment before the game where I honestly thought to myself, Hey, that woman
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.880]  looks like Doris Burke.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.920]  Oh, that's Doris Burke.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.160]  This game is on ESPN.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.640]  I honest to God almost said to my wife, that woman looks like Doris Burke.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.600]  So how does it feel to be that close instead of watching it on TV, right?
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.500]  Is it a different, I've had, I've never had such good seats for an NBA game, but I've
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.500]  had them.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.800]  Well, no, I, I, I lie.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.080]  I did have similarly good seats years ago.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.200]  It's it's immersive.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200]  It really is.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.200]  And the physicality is tremendous.
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.680]  I've always said, and basketball is the only sport I've ever had any real aptitude at as
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.200]  a rec league type player.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:23.720]  And the, the thing that the number one thing that I think casual fans don't understand
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:32.840]  about top tier basketball, well, a probably the, just how big NBA players are is I guess
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:39.800]  number one, but number two is how unbelievably good their hands are in terms of catching
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.440]  the ball.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.720]  Because I remember when I was in college at Drexel, Drexel's a division one team, and
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:48.800]  they were really good as a second tier division one team.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.400]  When I was there, they had a player named Malik Rose who went on to have an excellent
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.680]  NBA career with the San Antonio Spurs and a couple other teams, but I think he won some
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.680]  titles with them as sort of a six, six or seventh man.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.480]  And me and my pals intramural team, again, I couldn't play division one basketball, but
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.720]  our intramural team was always one of the best intramural teams.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:16.080]  And our last two years that I was there, we picked up players who had used up their eligibility,
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.080]  but still hadn't graduated.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.680]  So we had two years in a row, we had like division one, a division one player on our
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.680]  team.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.580]  I could hardly catch the ball when he, when they'd throw it to me.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.000]  And then they, you could, I could see it in their eyes.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.480]  They just were playing for fun and that, but they couldn't even pass the ball to us the
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.800]  way they wanted to because we couldn't catch it.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.680]  It would like break our fingers.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.640]  Every single pass in the NBA would break the fingers of most people trying to catch the
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640]  ball.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.640]  It is so hard.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.800]  And the rebounds, you see it on TV and you just take it for granted.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.500]  They just put one hand on it and they own the ball.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.760]  And when you're close, it's palpable.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:57.000]  It is like the ball, it's like having seats behind home plate and realizing that fast
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.680]  balls from major league pitchers actually do whistle as they go through the air.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.680]  Yeah.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:11.600]  So, so now I'll just point out Eddie Q who's in charge of Apple services is a veteran courtside
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.560]  NBA watcher for, as a warrior.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.880]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.460]  So he knows it well, right?
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.520]  So I think that there is definitely an informed perspective about sports inside Apple and
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.800]  it's not just Eddie, but Eddie's a great example of it.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.640]  And he knows what it's like to be their courtside versus watching it on TV.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.600]  And I think, yeah, I don't know exactly how they're going to do it, but the potential
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.080]  of my friends who are sports writers are talking to me because we're like, what is this going
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.080]  to be?
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.600]  And it's something, it's something probably.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.600]  All right.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.000]  Let's take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.560]  It's our good friends at collide.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.880]  K O L I D E collide with a K they've got some big news.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:59.880]  If you are an Okta user, O K T a another K I don't know what Okta is, but if you do well,
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.160]  they've got big news for you.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.120]  They can get your entire fleet of devices to 100% compliance.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:10.940]  How well, if a device in your fleet is not compliant, then the user can't log into your
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.560]  cloud apps until after they have fixed the problem.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.400]  It's that simple collide patches.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.920]  One of the major holes in zero trust architecture device compliance without collide, it department
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.760]  struggled to solve the basic problem of keeping everyone's O S and their browsers up to date.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.920]  Insecure devices are probably logging into your company's apps right now, because there's
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.720]  nothing there to stop them.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.480]  Collide is the only device trust solution that enforces compliance as part of authentication.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.440]  And it's built to work seamlessly with Okta.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.680]  The moment collides agent detects a problem, it alerts the user and gives them instructions
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.800]  to fix it.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.160]  If they don't fix the problem within a set time, they're blocked.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.040]  Collides method means fewer support tickets, less frustration, and more importantly, 100%
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:07.220]  fleet compliance visit collide.com that's K O L I D E dot com slash the talk show to
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:13.040]  learn more or book a demo that's collide.com slash the talk show.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:17.360]  All right, before we start running out of time, I, the other thing I definitely wanted
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:25.560]  to talk to you about is the long awaited announcement that an imminent arrival, a actual pro apps
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.800]  from Apple for iPad final cut, are they calling it?
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.080]  They're calling it final cut pro and logic, right?
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.960]  Or is it logic pro official logic pro too, right?
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960]  Yeah.
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.280]  I watch a pro for iPad final cut pro for iPad, but we can call them for shorthand logic and
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.280]  final cut.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.280]  Yeah.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:48.400]  Now I wanted to have you on and I, I, I equivocated as to whether I should have you on before
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.480]  they come out or just, uh, or wait till after and get your remarks, but I figured before
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480]  is better.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.680]  And you know, you've got plenty of other podcasts after they come out, you can, you can give
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.800]  your feelings, but I love your take on it.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:09.220]  And I particularly because you edit, you don't, you edit with logic on iPad yet because it's
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.960]  not out, but you do use ferrite ferrite studio.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:19.680]  What's the recording studio ferrite recording studio to edit podcasts on iPad.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.400]  And the part, I mentioned it when I linked to your article about it, but the part that
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.320]  really resonated with me was when you were talking about your efficiency or, or I'm not
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320]  prolific.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.000]  That's it efficiency.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.400]  The idea that, but how do you get all those roadblocks out of the way?
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.680]  So you can kind of pick up speed and you're like, okay, yeah, I'm really moving now.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.240]  And there are roadblocks in any user interface.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.920]  And the, one of the things about sophisticated and mature software is that they've been watching
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:53.120]  their users and they're trying to eliminate those roadblocks because really you want to
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.440]  end up in this almost like a flow state, right?
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.280]  Where it's like, you just are thinking about the things you need to do when you're doing
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:05.120]  the work and the affordances inside the tool almost like vanish because they're not blocking
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  you.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.000]  You're kind of moving through and that's the ideal state and good apps have it and bad
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000]  apps don't.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.520]  And there's a spectrum there.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.160]  And I feel like there were some very specific things I learned about ferrite as ferrite
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.160]  got developed.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:25.680]  And as some of them got introduced that completely changed how I use that product and got me
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.440]  into that state.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.760]  And I didn't see any of those in the demos of final cut and logic.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.560]  And that's what concerns me is that even if Apple has brought them there and that they're
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:44.600]  pretty fully featured has Apple leaped ahead in terms of all those other kind of like subtle
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.600]  multi-touch gestures and, and, and other kinds of gestures that are like the touch equivalent
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.360]  of keyboard shortcuts.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.760]  Like there was one, one demo video where the person keeps reaching up to the play button
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.440]  and a pause button, and then the play button again, every time they have to go up to the
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.480]  corner and press play or press pause.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.840]  And like, I used to have to do that in ferrite and they put in a shortcut where if you take
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.500]  two fingers and you tap it, it's play pause.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.600]  It's just a tap gesture and it was revolutionary, right?
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.040]  So that's the stuff I'm watching for when I'm, I'm looking at those apps.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.560]  I want to see when I get my hands on them, I really want to see stuff like that.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.360]  You know, are there pencil gestures, other finger gestures, are there multi touch taps
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.840]  and swipes and stuff, or are there still some tasks where you have to go tap and then tap
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.720]  and then tap and then tap and then tap.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.680]  When what you really want to do is go like triple tap and you're done or two fingers
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.680]  down and you're done.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.680]  And I don't know.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.680]  Yeah.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.920]  Like, so did they show the user going up to the corner to hit play pause over and over
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.320]  again because that made it obvious what was going on for the demo video or is it because
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.480]  that's the only way to do it because right.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.480]  And right.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.480]  Cause you, you don't know, right.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.600]  So I understand that you might, as somebody who's trying to make videos showing how I
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:04.700]  edit and ferrite it's, I had to mount a camera above my desk so that I could like show my
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.180]  fingers so you could see what I was doing.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.720]  Cause it's really hard.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:14.720]  And so I don't know whether Apple was being obvious because they want you to understand
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.560]  how you drive this thing via touch.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.280]  Also you know, one of the great things about the iPad is that there are all those different
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.280]  modes.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.160]  There's touch mode and there's pencil mode and there's keyboard mode and there's keyboard
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.080]  and trackpad mode, and they're all different.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:33.880]  And Apple's statements about this are very focused on touch and keyboard.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.040]  And then, and there's a little bit of pencil, but it's mostly touch and keyboard.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:44.600]  And again, I don't know for sure, but I read that as being, they had to pick some places
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:51.240]  to focus their attention and there, it may not be as pencil oriented as one might like.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.160]  It may not be as trackpad oriented as one might like, but you got to start somewhere.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.600]  And I just, I'm actually emotionally preparing myself for the idea that these are going to
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:05.640]  be good apps that have some learning to do about being iPad apps.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.000]  And again, you have to ship, right?
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.660]  It goes back to the headset talk we had good, good artists, great artists ship.
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:11.660]  You have to ship.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:17.980]  And so maybe it ships with a minimum viable product, which for Apple is very, very Apple's
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:23.940]  minimum viable product is very polished, but might be like you could be very little pencil
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.560]  support or just pencil as finger.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.160]  And it has to touch support is something that has to be there on day one.
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.360]  So you couldn't, you couldn't ship them where you have to use the pencil for precision and
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.860]  you can't edit with your big fat fingertip.
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.840]  So that's the hard part, right?
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.020]  That's job one, right?
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:45.040]  And that's the part that is fundamentally different from the Mac where there is no big
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.480]  fat finger on the Mac.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.360]  Because everybody knows there's no touchscreens on Macs yet.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.600]  And that's an altogether new editing interface for both apps.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.880]  I know exactly what you're talking about, though.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:02.120]  And it's the difference between pro tools and consumer tools, or one of them and and
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.940]  some great consumer tools add stuff like, you know, I think Apple has done a tremendous
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:15.560]  job as you know, as the author of a book on it with photos app, which is meant for everybody.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.800]  And I think has gained a lot of productivity features for going through lots of photos
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.960]  or applying.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:27.120]  One of the big features last year was applying the same edits to multiple photos, right?
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.720]  A huge time saver, you know, if you want to apply the same thing to 100 photos, you know,
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.520]  you've just saved from before the feature existed, you've just saved yourself doing
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.440]  the same thing 100 times in a row.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.120]  But pro apps have so many of those little things, right?
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.360]  And it's like, when you watch so I used to be pretty good at Photoshop, but never like
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.400]  a real Photoshop jockey, because I'm not an artist.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:25:00.480]  But like when I've watched really talented, like, pixel art style designers, who are just
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:08.080]  immersed in every single keyboard shortcut on Photoshop, doing their work, it's mesmerizing,
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.480]  but I have no idea what they're doing.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.320]  Because I don't know how it's possible that they're erasing and then they're drawing and
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320]  they're racing and dry.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.480]  And they're never doesn't seem to me like they're switching tools, because they're sort
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:22.800]  of courting with two hands, one on the mouse and one on the keyboard.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.220]  And they're going somebody who watched me edit text, just watched my screen editing
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:33.320]  text in bb edit, where I am a sort of pro level user, they would be like, I have no
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.000]  idea how that just happened.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.180]  Well, how did how did those two words change place?
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.360]  How did the line move up?
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.000]  I don't I don't understand what just happened.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.780]  I'd have to explain it or something else.
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.440]  Pro Tools are always full of those things, because that's what it means to be a pro is
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.600]  you want to be efficient, and you you want to get in the zone.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.800]  And again, it harks back to sports, right?
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:02.840]  You just you get in the zone with this tool that you've mastered, or the area of the tool
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.400]  that you've mastered, right, because a lot of these pro tools are so rich, like, for
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:13.560]  you, for example, you probably, I would guess, you're probably familiar with logic, even
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:14.560]  though you use ferrite.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.560]  Right?
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.560]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.640]  I mean, I think it would be fair to say that I use logic more than I use ferrite.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:28.200]  But but I use it for generally for slapping things, because I'm a Mac, a Mac primary user,
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.000]  like I said, at my desk using a Mac, and a lot of the podcast production that I do is
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  production.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.160]  Like, people send me files, and I trim them and put the music on them, and I put them
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  out, right?
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.480]  Like, I'm not doing a detail edit, the ferrite I'm using for kind of like things where I'm
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:47.440]  doing a detail edit, and I'm taking my time, and I might be doing it on an airplane or
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.740]  something like that.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.400]  So it's different, but I use I absolutely do use logic, and misuse it.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.040]  I think anybody, there are all these podcasts that are out there, wherever you've got podcasters
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.040]  talking about logic, I guarantee you, all of us are misusing logic, because logic's
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.040]  a music tool.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.840]  It is, yes, it's an audio tool, but logic's a music tool.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:13.500]  And from what I've seen of Apple's demo of logic on the iPad, logic on the iPad is even
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.680]  more so a music tool.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.240]  So I'm not convinced that any podcaster or radio journalist is ever going to want to
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.740]  use logic on the iPad.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.540]  And I can tell you, ferrite is is great.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.540]  Just use ferrite.
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:30.960]  It's made for that logic, I don't I think is going to be for musicians.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.640]  So where I'm it is what it is.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.580]  But that's where I'm going with it where there's you're not creating orchestral scores.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:37.980]  Like when they Apple has it.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:43.860]  Like when the Mac Pro 2019 Mac Pro came out at WWDC and they had the demo across the street.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:50.780]  And they should 1000 Yeah, it logic 1000 track, orchestral score from from I forget which
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:54.800]  movie, but you know, some kind of, yeah, made Michael Giacchino or something.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.800]  It was like, 1000 tracks.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.240]  And they said, and literally, it wasn't even possible before.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.720]  They had to Jerry rig it together with like, three separate projects that it sounded like
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.240]  I can't believe that they made it work.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.960]  And they had people real people.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960]  They're saying this.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.800]  Yeah, this is a godsend, because you can't believe how we did this before.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.420]  And you're not using those sort of features.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.160]  But I don't think that's misusing.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.520]  I think all great tools get used for things they weren't intended for exhibit a BB is
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.560]  that I'll go back to Rich Segal, the creator of VB edit has told this story many times
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.840]  where, you know, it was created as a programmer's editor for programming languages, and just
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  general text file editing.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.360]  And they had a plugin interface.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:48.800]  And the forget the guy's name, I think it was Craig somebody, but he made an HTML plugin
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.680]  for BB edit.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:56.220]  And it took off and it instantly became the most popular plugin for BB edit and rich and
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.240]  Patrick at bare bones are like, what's HTML?
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.320]  And all of a sudden, and then fast forward 18 months, they I think they, I think they
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.760]  actually acquired the plugin and used it built it in.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.640]  But all of a sudden, people thought BB edit was an HTML editor.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.760]  I mean, that's how it was built for years and years.
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:17.000]  That's great tools are like that, I would say Photoshop, Photoshop, it's right there
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.600]  in the name, it was meant for photographic editing, take this photograph and make it
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.460]  black and white or color tone it or change the saturation.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:33.500]  But then it became a must use tool by user interface designers creating software.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:38.560]  And I know that figma and other modern things have sort of taken the crown away from that
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:43.560]  for pixel perfect UI design, but probably because it's not the thing that was intended
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560]  for, right.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:50.240]  But there are 1000s and 10s of 1000s, I don't know, of user interface designers use Photoshop
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.400]  to make software user interfaces.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.040]  It's not meant for that, but it's it's good for it.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:59.720]  I agree with both sides of that, by the way, the pro tool, like, again, it's not what's
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.720]  on the label.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.680]  It's like medication where they're like, the off label uses the medications like that,
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.080]  like you build the tool, and like use it however, I built this, I made the screwdriver use it
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:11.840]  as a doorstop, if you like, it's like, whatever you you can do that.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:17.660]  The other side of it is also being true to yourself, like Photoshop would have not been
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:21.680]  true to Photoshop, if they had decided to chase being an app interface designer, right?
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.380]  Like, there's only so far you can take it before you're like, you know what, that's
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.400]  not what this app is for.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.400]  And you've got to be true to yourself.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:32.120]  And I do, I get the feeling that that's sort of what Apple's message with logic on the
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.520]  iPad is, is logic on the iPad, you could edit a podcast, and it may be but like, that's
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.680]  not what it's for.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:44.000]  And to be true to itself, they are going to make more things that involve music creation
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.640]  and production, because that's what it is at its core.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:48.640]  Yeah.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.400]  So why do you think it took so long?
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.640]  I think this is something that deserves a non ironic, finally.
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.520]  Yeah, hella fine.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:01.280]  I mean, I think what I wrote my thing is, I'd love to know why now, why now?
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.280]  Why now?
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:09.400]  Because if we do the math, it's been like, eight years ish, since the iPad Pro came out,
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:16.520]  and six ish years, since Apple did that event in Brooklyn, where they said, the iPad Pro,
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.080]  this new iPad Pro is faster than 90% of the PC laptops.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.680]  So they made the direct comparison.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:25.840]  And that's when all conversations about the hardware of the iPad being great, and why
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:30.640]  is the software not there, that's sort of where it started, and amplified by them, then
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:36.760]  doing an M1 iPad Pro and an M2 iPad Pro, but now there's M1 is in the mini, and it's in
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.400]  the air.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.680]  And when you've got an M2, you're like, Okay, well, this is obviously the same, I've got
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.720]  an M2 iPad Pro and an M2 MacBook Air on my desk right now, right?
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.040]  Like they're almost exactly the same computer.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.280]  I mean, really, yeah, other than the software that they're running.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:56.120]  And so Apple kept calling it into question, like, what's this for?
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.200]  And and when the M2 I was thinking back to it, I actually wrote about this when I reviewed
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.200]  the M2 iPad Pro.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.640]  It's like, Apple boasted so much about its computing prowess, and it did it by using
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.640]  DaVinci Resolve.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:14.920]  And I thought, what does that say that Apple itself has a video editing product that it's
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.520]  proud of on the Mac, and it's never come to the iPad Pro.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:21.840]  And now they're very happy that DaVinci Resolve is there, which is great.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.080]  I mean, it's great that it's there.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.600]  But so so what changed?
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.720]  And I don't have an answer.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.600]  I mean, I don't even my guess is that it was harder than they expected.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.160]  And my guess is that they started later than they thought they were going to because I
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160]  don't know.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.240]  I don't know.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:42.280]  That's my best guess is that they've got teams that work on these things, and they were going
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.280]  to look.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.400]  I don't think these are ports, right?
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:50.880]  I think these are maybe using some code, but these feel like they are reconceived.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:55.280]  And maybe the Final Cut One is based a little bit or the Logic One is based a little bit
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:58.520]  on GarageBand or something because I think they're related to each other.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.280]  Just like GarageBand on the Mac is like a light version of Logic.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:06.400]  But like, I think it took more work and that they've started late and maybe did not have
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:12.760]  organizational buy in to devote so much development time to these iPad versions versus the Mac
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760]  versions.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:19.080]  And then maybe it took longer than they expected because I can't think of anything that's happened
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:23.280]  in the last couple of years that would have made them be like, oh, now, now we need to
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.280]  do it.
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.240]  It feels more like it.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.100]  They were being ready for M1 and M2 would have been perfect, right?
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.100]  And they weren't there.
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.580]  So I think maybe it just took longer than they thought.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:38.720]  And it was and they couldn't get enough organizational sign off early enough to make it happen sooner.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:46.960]  Yeah, I wonder and I wonder how much of it is sort of a necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:54.280]  And the iPad has always suffered by not really being necessary.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.240]  My analogy and as I get older, I realize it's like, hey, I'm letting years fly by here.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.640]  Like the iPad, I mean, it might be fair enough to only go back to iPad Pro, but that's still
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.240]  eight whole years.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.200]  But the iPad itself is is 13 years old.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:17.680]  And I just go back to the original Mac, which came out in 1984.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:27.160]  And when I got to college in 1991, the entire publishing industry was entirely on the Macintosh
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:34.640]  by that time, like, and so like, and I remember at the student newspaper Drexel, the triangle
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.800]  by the time I started using and learning Quark Express and Photoshop, why I kind of had Photoshop
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:40.800]  at Quark.
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:47.400]  Quark was what I learned there to do desktop layout by 1992.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.480]  And I think by that it was so established that I remember talking about it with other
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.500]  people at the paper at the time, nobody at that time had any memory at all or knowledge
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.180]  of how in the world they put the paper together.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:06.760]  Or nobody it had, nobody knew, like, I don't know, it's somebody, there was somebody there
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:13.180]  who had some vague idea of how they somehow set columns of type and pasted it all together
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.960]  with paper and glue and stuff.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:21.000]  I don't know, nobody knew it eight years, I mean, fewer than eight years, because by
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.360]  the time I got there, it was already institutionalized.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.080]  I don't remember.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.000]  And I remember going to print bureaus with zip drives or whatever, or CD drives or whatever
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.960]  else we had stuff on to get printed.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.520]  Everything came to the printers on disk in desktop publishing formats, like within, I
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.360]  would say by the end of the 80s, by 1988 or 89, the entire publishing industry in four
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:55.580]  or five years had entirely been turned from an analog physical art to something that was
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.280]  entirely done on software.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:04.120]  And yet, here's the iPad at 13, and it's only getting these Pro Tools now.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:12.560]  And I think it's because in the 80s, when the Macintosh was new, and as soon as everyone
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:20.280]  realized the potential that, hey, we could write software like PageMaker and Illustrator
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.180]  and QuarkXPress and Freehand, oh, don't let me forget to mention Freehand, which I always
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:29.180]  like better than Illustrator because it actually made sense to me.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:35.000]  As soon as people realized they could make this software and how much more efficient
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.240]  it would make them and how it would enable them to do things that theretofore couldn't
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:47.440]  even be done, then that necessity as the mother of invention made it happen as quickly as
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:48.440]  possible.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.440]  The race was on.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.880]  Whereas with the iPad, that pressure's never been there because you could just use a Mac.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:59.420]  Yeah, I mean, the times that I got most creative with the iPad were when I decided to travel
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.920]  with just an iPad and not a Mac.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.680]  And since Apple Silicon, I've just traveled with an Apple Silicon MacBook Air and it hasn't
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.680]  been a problem.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:14.340]  But yeah, look, it feels to me like when you and all those people were called out to Cupertino
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:19.060]  to hear that the Mac is going to be fine and that they're going to make a new Mac Pro.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:24.420]  Something weird went on in the mid-2010s, and I think, and I have some hint that this
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:29.260]  is true, but I don't know for sure, that there was a moment where everybody at Apple basically
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.020]  said the Mac is a legacy platform.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.260]  We're going to deprecate it.
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.540]  The iPad is the future.
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:41.260]  We're going to replicate all the functionality of the Mac inside the iPad.
[01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:45.100]  And at some point down the road, there'll be a Pro iPad and the iPad will have a mode
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:47.000]  where it'll be much more Mac-like.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.600]  And by the time the Mac is at the end of its life, the iPad will be ready to take its place.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.120]  And then something happened, and I think it was probably involving Apple Silicon.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.280]  They decided to look at using Apple Silicon on the Mac and what that gave to the Mac.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.440]  And something in there changed, and I feel like when they had that meeting with you and
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:15.280]  Pansarino and all those other people, from the outside, I look at that and I think that
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.760]  is the moment where they're saying the Mac is not a legacy platform anymore.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.260]  We're not planning on it just staying on Intel and putting very little into it and letting
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:25.400]  it fade away.
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.100]  And they came up with another plan, which I think was great as a Mac user.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:38.780]  I think that's great, but I think in doing so, they also made the iPad's path a big question
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:43.780]  mark because I think the iPad went from being the future of computing, because I do really
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:47.180]  believe there was a period where everybody at Apple believed, or at least lots of people
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.740]  at Apple in charge, believed the iPad was the future of computing.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:52.500]  And then it wasn't anymore.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:58.720]  It was a product in their lineup for some things, but what exactly?
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.960]  And that leads us to today, where there's an iPad Pro and it's very impressive, but
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.420]  what's it do and what's it for?
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:13.100]  In the long run, I think I would not be surprised if we go down the line and there are touchscreen
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:19.460]  Macs and Apple sort of pours everything they learned about touchscreen interfaces from
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:26.040]  the iPad into the touchscreen mode on a Mac and that the iPad and Mac actually do kind
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.740]  of come together a little bit more, not necessarily for like regular iPad users, but like the
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.400]  idea of the pro use of the iPad becomes something totally different.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.300]  And they use what they learned on the iPad Pro and they put it in the Mac and now you've
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:42.540]  got convertible Macs that are great iPad Pros and they're great Macs and they can be either
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:43.540]  one.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.540]  And like, that would be an awesome product.
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:50.420]  And I think they could probably get there, but it does feel like, and these new apps
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.040]  might be the future of the platform, right?
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.300]  Because Apple is a big company, but like no company is supporting as many computing platforms
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.300]  as Apple is.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:04.100]  And the only way that Apple can do it is by reusing its tech everywhere.
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.860]  And so I look at the iPad stuff and I'm like, well, they'll probably reuse that on the Mac,
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:08.860]  right?
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.300]  Maybe not today, but in five years, maybe they have a unified code base and it's got
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:18.260]  a touch version and it also runs on the Mac and that that is where they are going with
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:19.260]  that product.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:25.620]  Also, if the headset can run iPad apps, means you could edit video and maybe other stuff
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.460]  and audio on the headset too.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:29.460]  Who knows?
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.660]  Like there's, cause again, it's all about reusing stuff.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.180]  So yeah, I don't know.
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:37.260]  I just, as somebody who really likes the iPad and I use it for a lot of stuff, but I also
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:38.940]  love my Mac.
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:43.020]  It just, it's a, it's always been a little weird wondering like what Apple actually thinks
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:49.900]  the iPad is for and where it fits and, and they're, they're finding their way again now,
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:54.940]  but it, something changed and called the whole original premise into question.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:59.260]  I don't think anybody would claim that Apple believes that in 10 years, the Mac's not going
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.060]  to be around and it's just going to be iPads.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.220]  Like nobody believes that now.
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:08.020]  And I think 10 years ago, 12 years ago, eight years ago, somewhere in there, a lot of people
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.300]  at Apple thought that was true.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.300]  That was very well said.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:18.100]  I I'll just call back to the last few years of my on-stage interviews with Craig Federighi
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:23.260]  after WWDC talking about like catalyst when it was new talking about catalyst when it
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.260]  was okay.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:26.900]  It's a year old talking about.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:34.460]  To me, the premier, I don't see how it could even be argued that the, the best catalyst
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:40.900]  app in the world is messages for Mac, which brought everything over, including Apple script
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:41.900]  support.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:47.860]  I mean, it's, it is, it's, it's a better Mac app than the previous Mac app was.
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:50.280]  That's how good it is using catalyst.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.300]  But and again, they're Apple executives never talk too much about process and never talk
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.620]  too much about, or at all about what's going on behind the scenes, but you could read between
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:08.860]  the lines and everybody out there knows Federighi as this very personable persona, who's quite
[01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:15.820]  possibly the most popular, or certainly at WWDC where it's his time to show software.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.580]  But he he's one of the faces of the company and a spokesperson for the company.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:21.940]  And he's very, very good at it.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.780]  And that's, that's not his job.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:27.540]  It's just, you know, it's icing on the cake that there's senior vice president for software
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:35.300]  engineering is also a handsome and charismatic and beloved presenter on these things.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:41.460]  He, he loves good software, he really is, it's not just he's interested in code.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:46.320]  He's actually very, very highly opinionated about the software itself and enthusiastic
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.340]  about it.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:52.660]  And also, though, as I alluded to earlier, with the annual schedule that they're all
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:59.500]  of their platforms are on, he's under his leadership, they've gotten very, very organized
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:02.420]  and efficient at getting software out the door.
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:08.160]  And I part of that is things like, okay, they're not going to have two separate code bases
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.720]  for Apple News, right?
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.160]  It's it's going to be one app.
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.180]  It's not worth it.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:22.020]  And honestly, the Mac version of Apple News and stocks and what are the other podcasts
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.020]  there?
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.780]  They're not as good as they would be if they were pure app kit apps.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:32.620]  That's that's undeniable messages is an example that, you know, that counters that.
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.540]  But something's got to give, right?
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.900]  It's not like they've got this excess engineering resources, where they could have all these
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.180]  other teams, right?
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.020]  They're they're actually they're peddled to the metal to get what they're getting out.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:50.660]  Not even Microsoft and Google support, like, I mean, Microsoft has Windows, Google has
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:56.900]  Android, Apple's got iOS, iPad, OS, Mac, OS, TV, like, the list goes on.
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.180]  The only way that they can do that is by recycling software.
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:04.300]  They can't have and as Mac users, we all know that messages app was terrible, right?
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:07.020]  And it was always years behind iOS, right?
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:08.540]  And now it's not right.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:12.740]  And although it's not the same, and like Final Cut, like, I'm sure there are people out there
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.140]  who've got to chill who are like, wait a second.
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:20.980]  I know the new logic does, and the new Final Cut Pro Pro do more or less everything that
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:25.100]  the ones on the desktop not quite but close, but like, you're not going to make us use
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:26.940]  those on the Mac, are you?
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:33.020]  And I think the answer inevitably, eventually is probably yes.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.020]  But not yet.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.620]  I wonder, I could see that coming.
[01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.980]  And it would be.
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:45.780]  So I guess the best example of that, where the Mac kind of took a hit was, and it wasn't
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.620]  to share a code base, because it was years and years before catalyst.
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:57.140]  But when Apple made the shift from iPhoto to photos, photos for Mac lost a lot of features
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:45:01.020]  that iPhoto had.
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:07.300]  But what it did was it let you have one shit, one cloud library that was shared between
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:10.380]  your devices and everything was there, and it was worth it.
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.020]  And then they caught back up.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.660]  I guess they built it back.
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:18.260]  Final Cut Pro X was like that too, the previous Final Cut Pro, and famously, everybody was
[01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.740]  furious about it.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:24.900]  And they got caught up eventually, but like, in the moment, they weren't all 100% there,
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:29.780]  but Apple felt there was a benefit to making that break and to doing something new.
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.780]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:35.020]  And that's why I think the beauty of it is, if this is the future of Final Cut Pro and
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:39.300]  Logic everywhere, the beauty of it is it doesn't have to be on the Mac right now.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.500]  Like it is separated by an entire platform.
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:48.300]  So they can iterate and make it better, but they don't have to inflict it on Mac users
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:49.300]  yet.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:50.300]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:51.300]  iWork is another example, right?
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:58.980]  There was a big, there was a major, major reset for iWork where they went to, okay,
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.660]  now we've got iOS versions.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:01.660]  Right.
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:07.700]  And, and I think more than just shared code base, it was to be able to round trip the
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.700]  documents.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:15.420]  And so all sorts of features that the document, older document files would support that required
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.820]  underlying macOS technologies that weren't in iOS were gone.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:25.440]  And so from the Mac users perspective, and the one that really sucked for me were the,
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:30.780]  some of the advanced typographic features that pages for Mac had previously supported
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:36.040]  because they were all based on the, I don't even know if it's an NS text, but whatever
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:42.740]  they're in app kit and they're available for any Mac app kit app to do these absolutely
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:48.540]  wonderful top-notch typographic, being able to use open type fonts and access alternate
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:53.780]  glyphs, get proper small caps, kerning and stuff like that.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.180]  All that went away.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:59.020]  And that really was like, my pages documents look like garbage now.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:03.300]  I mean, because they don't, I was using all these features, features.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:08.220]  They caught back up eventually it, I think with a pro app there, or at least this time,
[01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:14.200]  as opposed to with the final cut pro to final cut pro X or whatever, the, whatever that
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:19.540]  transition was where they, they lost features, I guess it seems like what they're doing,
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:24.380]  you know, and, and final cut is the better example because you can't round trip projects
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:26.420]  with the iPad version.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:30.860]  There's obviously some stuff that's going that, that's whether it's in the app itself
[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:36.500]  or whether it's the app using features in Mac OS that aren't in iPad OS yet or both.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:41.220]  And I wouldn't be surprised if it's both that for now it's two different apps and you can
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:46.460]  go from iPad to Mac, but you can't go from Mac to iPad, but you have to start somewhere
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:52.220]  and an iPad version of final cut that you can use is certainly better than not having
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.220]  one at all.
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:54.220]  Exactly.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:59.200]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor.
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.420]  And that is our very, very good friends at Squarespace.

[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.540]  What else did I?
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.540]  Oh, we got it.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.540]  Just a little bit.
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:15.540]  We got it.
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:17.100]  We got a bitch about GM, right?
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.100]  Let's do it.
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:19.100]  Yeah.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:25.500]  Oh, we have to, we have, it's made me like, I was just going to write, it's like you,
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:26.980]  you were telling me earlier.
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.940]  I was just going to write a link post.
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:33.540]  I was just going to write a link to the nine to five Mac article and be like, look, GM
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.560]  did this thing.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:41.820]  And then like, then I'm a thousand words deep and I'm like, this is, this is a whole thing.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.500]  Like I, it was, don't get me started.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.760]  Oh, I got started.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.680]  So I might as well go and in the intervening time, it's only become more absurd.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:54.320]  This idea that GM is going to drop CarPlay and Android auto from all of its EVs and make
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:58.140]  a step to question marks and a picture of a cloud step three profit, right?
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.840]  Like they're going to, they're going to do it somehow.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:06.200]  They're going to make a lot of money, who knows how, but somehow, and then the moment
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:13.380]  that really made me laugh is when the guy from Ford came out and said, our customers
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:19.780]  like CarPlay and we dropped the ball and they're never coming back because everybody loves
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:20.780]  their smartphones.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:24.860]  So we're going to keep doing it because I can't imagine looking our customers in the
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:33.260]  eye and saying, good luck, which was, and he meant F you.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:38.620]  And like that, that moment of, cause I had that moment of like, am I, am I crazy here?
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:42.720]  It's like, it seems like this is a bad move unless literally everybody in the auto industry
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  does it.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:49.140]  And surely somebody is going to say, say, maybe we could differentiate by not doing
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:50.400]  what GM is doing.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:53.180]  And then you start picking through the numbers as you have done, you've been doing a lot
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:59.360]  of math this last week, which is like, can they possibly do what they are claiming they're
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.140]  going to be able to do in terms of all the money that they're going to make by withholding
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:09.080]  features from their customers and then charging them for second tier, second rate versions
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.400]  of those features on their platform.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:15.360]  And the answer is even in the wildest imagination, it doesn't seem like they could even succeed
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.360]  at it.
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:17.360]  Yeah.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:22.020]  The Ford CEO is a Jim Farley and the interview is with friend of the show, Joanna Stern,
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.100]  who's just a terrific on-stage interviewer, but I love that interview.
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:29.940]  And I wrote, and when I linked to it, I was like, you've got to watch this because it's
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:34.940]  his laugh that says more than his words and his words were damning enough.
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:41.340]  But he, she asks about GM's plan to drop carplay and he bursts out laughing and goes,
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:42.940]  yeah, how about that?
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:48.500]  It's like, can you even read his laughter says, can you even believe our good luck?
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.500]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:56.100]  Because for a lot of Ford vehicle or GM vehicles, like the, the big, the big SUVs and the big
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:53:02.700]  pickup trucks, if somebody is going to, if however many people are going to assuming
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:06.600]  that this carplay, no more carplay thing goes through.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:11.140]  And right now they've said it's only for future EVs, but since they've announced the discontinuation,
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:15.580]  continuation of the bolt, it more or less means all of their EVs, right?
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:17.700]  All all cars are going to be EVs.
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:21.460]  I mean, I don't know how long that timeline is, but it's new cars.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.380]  It's probably like in 15 years.
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:24.380]  Yeah.
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:30.740]  And that, that, that, that was sort of transitions often reach a tipping point, right?
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:35.460]  And so right now I would say 15 years sounds good, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:39.980]  more like 10 years because at a certain point it tips and all of a sudden everybody's in
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.420]  a race to get rid of their gas cars.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:46.140]  And they're like, if you want a gas car, seriously, do go, go to this other, go to some other
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:47.140]  company.
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:51.740]  We don't want the inefficiency of having two entirely different drive trains.
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:57.540]  If you're going to buy a big Chevy pickup truck and you, but you want carplay and net,
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:01.100]  you're either going to go to Ford or to, to Dodge.
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.100]  That's it.
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:06.580]  There aren't any other companies or you'll buy that Chevy truck and you'll be mad and
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:10.420]  you'll have to buy one of those things that sits in your cup holder or a suction cup or
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:12.160]  something to get the carplay that you want.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.500]  Because that's the bottom line, right?
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.060]  It's like, this is not, Oh, iPhone users are really mad because the car, that's not what
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.060]  it is.
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:21.100]  What it is is that all the smartphone is number one.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:26.940]  Like, I mean, let's just any, any business who thinks that they're cockamamie tech product
[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:32.620]  is Supreme over the smartphone is a business that you should run away from, right?
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.340]  Because people love their smartphones.
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:37.820]  iPhone is the greatest product thus far invented, right?
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.820]  Like in the 21st century, it is everybody loves it.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:45.380]  Our lives are on it to say, I know your lives.
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:49.800]  I know all your music and podcasts is on your phone, but when you get in your car, don't
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.900]  use your phone or use it using Bluetooth, which is like a real, let them eat cake kind
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.240]  of moment.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:55:01.900]  The level of delusion that you have to have to believe that you're going to force people
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:07.320]  to take their beloved thing and subsume it in your, even if it's good to start, right?
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.580]  It's going to car companies don't update their software.
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:14.040]  It's going to be kind of second rate and it's not going to be compatible with all your stuff.
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:15.620]  And you it's, I've got my phone right here.
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.620]  I bought a new one.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:20.540]  It's got the latest software after a couple of years, it's going to be even more difficult
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:22.540]  to make that comparison.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:26.860]  So I get the ego of like, no, no, we want to own that customer and we want to sell them
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:28.000]  on stuff.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.540]  Like Farley said from Ford, the truth is there is, he was, he did not sound delusional.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:37.580]  He's like, look, when we're doing partial autonomy, when we're doing navigation, there
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:41.360]  are lots of things where, cause the Evie, it knows your battery state.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.780]  It knows where all the chargers are.
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:47.120]  It's probably tied into the charger network in ways that maybe your phone isn't certainly
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:48.120]  it's charged.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.460]  It knows it's battery state and your phone doesn't, right?
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:56.220]  So there's like lots of value in an Evie doing things like that or, or lane keeping or changing
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.940]  lanes or limited self-driving functionality.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.980]  Of course your car is going to do that part, but like the entertainment part, Farley was
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:06.640]  like, do we really like, do we really need to be that?
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.940]  And I think the answer is clearly no.
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:11.480]  And so I like that he's that, that sane about it.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:16.260]  I did hear, so there's a guy who listens to all our podcasts, who's a car expert.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.860]  His name is Sam Abu Elsamid.
[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:21.860]  I had him on upgrade last summer and he wrote to me when this was going on and something
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:24.440]  he said that I think not enough people know.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:30.260]  So Farley re-orged Ford into two parts, their internal combustion vehicle part and their
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:31.580]  Evie part.
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:37.260]  And the leader of the Evie part of Ford is Doug field, who used to work at Apple and
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.940]  previously used to work at Tesla.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:48.220]  And as Sam wrote to me, Doug is very unlikely to ditch carplay like I, and, and he goes
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:53.940]  on to say, and I agree, like, I like that automakers are going to get subscription revenue
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.940]  for stuff.
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:55.940]  It's going to happen.
[01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:56.940]  It's inevitable.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:00.700]  But like where you draw the line is sort of like in the car versus the stuff you bring
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:02.760]  with you that you carry with you all the time.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:06.580]  And GM wants to erect a barrier and say, when you get in the car, forget, you even have
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.000]  a smartphone.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.660]  And that seems delusional to me.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:12.180]  So good luck to them.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:16.020]  I wonder what, what are the odds that they're going to rethink it after all of this?
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.300]  I think they're going to rethink it.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:21.000]  And I think the major reason they're going to rethink it is that they don't really have
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.980]  a direct relationship with their customers.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:27.220]  They, they deal with dealers and the dealers deal with customers.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:33.060]  And I honestly think the U S I think, I guess our Congress has higher priorities and there's
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:38.980]  a lot of issues in the world, but it's, it's a, to me, the laws that keep the big three
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:43.580]  automakers from owning their own dealerships are antiquated, you know, and it's a whole
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:46.340]  regulatory thing from the 20th century.
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.300]  But do the dealers feel like when they're like, GM's like, Oh, we're going to make so
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:52.720]  much money on subscriptions and the dealers like, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:54.180]  I have hands off our customer.
[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:59.180]  I haven't bought a new car in a long time, very long time, but I I've heard, cause I've
[01:57:59.180 --> 01:58:01.020]  been harping on it on daring fireball.
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:05.800]  I keep hearing, I've heard from readers over and over and over and over and over again
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:09.500]  that when they've bought cars recently, they take out their phone.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:12.900]  And as soon as they take it out, the, the, the sales person says, Oh, let me show you
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.900]  how to hook up carplay.
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.340]  They know that it's important.
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:18.140]  They know it is Apple.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:24.580]  Apple said last year at WWDC that 79% of car buyers, new car buyers in the U S want carplay
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:31.860]  70, not 79% of iPhone owners buying new cars, 79% of all people buying cars want carplay
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:38.700]  because new car buyers are disproportionately iPhone owners and they want carplay and people
[01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:44.180]  who own Android, whether it's because they don't care about nice things or they're frugal
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:48.940]  or they just have a lower budget are more likely to be in the used car market.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:54.620]  But I'll bet most, I'll bet Android owners, people who do own Android phones want Android
[01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:55.620]  auto support.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:56.620]  Absolutely.
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.140]  So, and you're right.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:02.200]  The people, the salespeople in the dealerships know that they know it.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.100]  Maybe Mary, Mary Barra doesn't know that, but the dealers and their salespeople know
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:09.760]  exactly what closes the deal on a car and carplay is part of it there.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.760]  And they're cockamamie.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:15.340]  Oh, it's like carplay, but it doesn't, does it have my, oh, it doesn't have overcast,
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:21.260]  but you or, or pocket cast, but you could just use the Ford or the Google podcasts,
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:22.260]  whatever.
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.620]  And you're like, what are you talking about?
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.620]  Like goodbye.
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:25.980]  Get, get, get out of here.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.980]  Forget it.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:30.340]  There's I haven't listened to it yet, but I am just making a note right here.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:33.340]  You, Jason, you can watch on video, you can see me writing it down.
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.000]  There's apparently a, this American life episode from a couple of years ago where it was sort
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.140]  of like a documentary, look at a car dealership somewhere in like long Island or something.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.380]  And apparently it's, it's so profane that they're like the version you can download
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:48.500]  has all the swear words, but the one they, the one they broadcast hasn't bleeped out
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:52.060]  and Ira glass says, you should really, if you, if you don't mind, you should really
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.060]  listen to the swear word one.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:58.020]  But it just, but the thing everybody kind of knows this as a, as a, as a consumer, you
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:00.580]  know, that the car salesman have a rip.
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:05.240]  It's almost a notorious occupation where you come in and they give you the hard sell, right?
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.420]  And they're trying to upgrade you to things you don't want.
[02:00:07.420 --> 02:00:10.280]  And they don't want you to leave the lot without making a purchase.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:14.140]  But it's a high pressure job because it's all commissioned, right?
[02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:21.600]  It's not like, again, no, no, no slight to people who work behind the counter at a coffee
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:26.460]  shop, but it's like at a coffee shop, if you come in, you know, and you say, I would like
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:30.520]  a cold brew and they're like, ah, we're out of cold brew today.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:31.520]  What else can I get you?
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:32.520]  And you're like, ah, you know what?
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.520]  I'm just going to get nothing.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.640]  They don't really care.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:35.640]  That's fine.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:38.800]  If you walk out and go down the street to the next coffee shop, cause you really want
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.800]  a cold brew.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:44.960]  Whereas a car sales person really wants you to buy a goddamn car because that's their
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.000]  income depends on it.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.200]  If there's a top feature that GM no longer has that every, every other car maker has,
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200]  GM is going to hear it.
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.040]  So I think it may be that we're wasting time talking about this cause they're going to,
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.600]  they're going to rescind it.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.660]  But on the other hand, maybe it's too late.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.940]  They've already made this higher.
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.760]  They've hired Mike Abbott away from Apple.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:13.160]  He was, he was in Eddie, Eddie Q's services division.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.160]  Yeah.
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.440]  There's a lot of cars out there that use Android automotive now and they support CarPlay and
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.440]  Android auto.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.280]  So it's, it's, it's not a fait accompli, right?
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:26.360]  They, they, they can not lock out Android auto and CarPlay and be fine.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.360]  Right.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.660]  Other than the fact that like one of the notes that I made when I was writing about this
[02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:36.180]  is that GM has been an innovator in getting ongoing revenue out of their customers.
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:42.560]  They invented OnStar, which is a service where you pay my, I, I recently visited my mom and
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:47.000]  we were going through her credit card bills and she was paying like $40, I don't know
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:54.040]  a month, a quarter, whatever for OnStar, which is literally like a cell modem in your car
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:02:00.800]  that you, people can call the car and you can, it's like a GPS log of where the car
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:01.800]  is.
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:07.440]  And like, it's basically a technology that I think has been completely subsumed by having
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.640]  a cell phone, but, or a watch or a watch at this point.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:12.640]  Yeah.
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:14.060]  I mean, really.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:19.760]  And so we canceled it and, but, but like how much that car, my mom and dad bought that
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.520]  car, like it's like 12 years old.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:27.960]  Like they have been paying after the trial for OnStar and Sirius XM.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:33.600]  And I'm sure that GM gets a portion of that too for years after they bought the car.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.200]  And like that is sweet, sweet post purchase revenue.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.720]  And I get it like, so they are experts in that.
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.440]  I just think they overstepped here, right?
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:48.200]  I, I still think, honestly, look, you look at these smart EVs that are out there now,
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.920]  having a connectivity package and charging people for it kind of does make sense because
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:54.900]  it does allow you to do things like use their app.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:59.940]  To start the air conditioner, like EVs, you don't have to turn over the internal combustion
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.780]  engine to pre-cool the car or to leave it cool with your dog inside like Tesla's got
[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:05.780]  a dog mode.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:06.780]  Yeah.
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:07.780]  Like, and so you can have this fancy app.
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:11.260]  It talks to your car because you're paying for the, the connectivity feature.
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:14.600]  That's the modem in the car that is on the cellular network.
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:21.020]  Like there are ways they charging for like Tesla charges for it's self-driving computer.
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:25.280]  That's in every Tesla, but they charge to turn it on and it's like 12,000 bucks.
[02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:30.300]  Like there are lots of ways that we might look at and say, they're kind of shady, but
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:37.480]  like arguably are part of the post purchase feature set of a car, but erecting the wall
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:41.520]  on CarPlay and being like, no, no, no, no, no, you can't play your podcasts other than
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:43.200]  through Bluetooth.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.780]  That's the part where I think they just overstepped.
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:48.280]  I think they may wave at and realize that they can still make a lot of money in their
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:51.520]  car without turning off all the people who have iPhones.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:52.520]  Yeah.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.560]  From my notes here, I wrote spreadsheet should model the strategy, not vice versa.
[02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:57.560]  And by that.
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:58.560]  Right.
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.220]  And that, that's what this reeks of to me.
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.520]  And I called him Kendall, Kendall Roy numbers.
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:03.520]  I'm a fan.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.960]  I don't know if you watch succession, but so Kendall Roy is a character on this show
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:12.900]  succession who's who just comes up with ideas like, well, maybe we could double, double
[02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:15.340]  the revenue from our cruise ship business.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:17.360]  And somebody's like, well, where did that come from?
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  Yeah.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.600]  And he's like, well, well, if we did, and then he plugs it into a spreadsheet and it's
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.880]  like, well, now the numbers look good and it's like, yeah, but to me, this is somebody
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:30.040]  who plugged some numbers into an Excel spreadsheet and said, well, if we, if we did this and,
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:34.440]  and this many people sign up for it, we'll make $20 billion a year in revenue.
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.640]  And Mary Barra, the GM CEO is like, that sounds great.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:39.140]  I would love to have that.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.680]  And it's like, yeah, but that's not going to happen.
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:48.360]  The thing that I feel like is that it is very good to have a hardware business and a sustainable
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.360]  one.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:54.800]  And the car makers have been here for a century and I think are going to be here for a while
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.240]  to come.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:03.280]  They're selling 30, 40, 50, 60, $70,000 hardware devices, right?
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.440]  Don't think of it as cars.
[02:05:04.440 --> 02:05:08.000]  They're the most expensive things people buy other than their house.
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.360]  They're more expensive than anything Apple sells.
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.440]  And Apple's known for selling very expensive stuff.
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:17.560]  I guess you can configure a Mac pro that's in the car range, but for the most part, they
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:22.520]  sell the most expensive things people buy other than their houses.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:25.000]  There is plenty of money to be made, right?
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  You don't have to.
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.440]  And so if you want to sell services, have them tied to your hardware features.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:36.160]  GM does sell access to their, they call it Cruz, which is their semi-autonomous thing.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:38.480]  That's something Apple, your phone can't do.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:41.480]  Your phone can't drive your car for you.
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:47.760]  BMW infamously has started charging subscription money to get the seat warmers to work.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.840]  That's BMW is right, but that's their seats.
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:53.480]  They can design the seats that work that way.
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:56.320]  If it's, I think they just recently, they did the thing where they're like, well, we're
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:59.620]  going to give you our navigation system for eight years, but after that, it requires so
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:02.800]  much updating and we're not going to, if you're not paying us, we're not going to do it.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:08.440]  And like after like, okay, like, yeah, I, I, I think there are gradations.
[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:12.160]  Gradations of like, it's outrageous that it's just a seat warmer and you're going to make
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.560]  me pay a subscription to use it.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.240]  But at the same time, like everybody makes their buying decisions.
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.480]  I do think that there are places where it's reasonable, right?
[02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.080]  Like there are places to make money, but, but there are also places where it's not part
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.560]  of the integral car experience.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:26.240]  And I think that's where they overstepped, right?
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:30.560]  I think they stepped in it when they were, when they're like, no, no, no, look in the
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:35.640]  end, this is all about their hubris because they are jealous of how attached people are
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.480]  to their smartphones and in their cars.
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:42.800]  And they don't like that their second fiddle to the smartphone in the car, I get why they
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:46.800]  don't like it, but that's what their customers want.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:48.920]  And there's no way.
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:54.480]  There's no way a car can ever be in first place, unless you're like a driver, unless
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:07:01.120]  you're like a Lyft driver or a trucker or something like we all leave our cars and our
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:03.980]  phone is with us when we're outside of our cars too.
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:06.540]  The car will never be in first position.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:10.060]  And I know that burns car makers, but like, it's the truth.
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:14.160]  So you just got to get over it and say, okay, Apple and Google have that part, but we've
[02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.680]  got all the rest.
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:17.920]  And there's plenty of opportunity there.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:21.000]  And there's a hundred little things, you know what I mean?
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  Like the way, and again, it could make a multi-user system.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  My wife and I have two different seat positions in our car and it remembers it, but it's like,
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:37.920]  I would guess a majority of cars or close to it are shared by multiple people in a household
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:44.240]  and just having one spouse's stuff on the dashboard when they're driving and the others
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:48.320]  when they're driving, you don't even have to worry about it if you just defer it to
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:49.320]  the phone.
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:55.280]  And I, again, I'll stop and cut it off, but I thought that Farley's comment that we lost
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:08:00.240]  this a decade ago, it was so refreshingly, Frank, I honestly, I don't invest in individual
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:05.880]  companies, but his comments were so Frank fresh and direct and his laugh.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:09.200]  I was like, man, if I was going to invest in a car company, I'd put some money in Ford
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.440]  because this guy seems to know what the hell he's doing.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:14.720]  He's his focus is on what Ford can do well.
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:17.800]  And he's like, yeah, that would be nice, but we lost that a decade ago.
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.440]  So why worry about it?
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:24.600]  The act of splitting the company in two, I think is arguably a brilliant move because
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:26.720]  everybody's got their own motivations, right?
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:30.440]  Everybody's got their own, like their numbers to hit and they're all of that.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:37.060]  And I think he identified that the job of the people making EVs, they are prioritizing
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:41.660]  totally different things than the people who are doing internal combustion vehicles.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:46.900]  And that if you merge them together right now, the internal combustion is always going
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:50.640]  to win because that's the bulk of the business today.
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.640]  And you're never going to get to the future.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:58.800]  And if you believe that the future is EVs, you got to let your EV business chart its
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.600]  own course in a way that that's smart.
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:05.880]  And so for him to sort of say, look, these two businesses are kind of opposed and we
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.840]  need to let them kind of make the right decisions for them.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.960]  That also seems really smart.
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.020]  He seems like a really, really smart guy.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:15.360]  So I hope it goes well.
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.640]  I also talk about the opportunity here.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:20.680]  You said, I said 15 years and you're like, maybe sooner.
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.720]  I do think that that's some of this is sort of like with a tenor of panic about it, not
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.400]  panic that they're going to go out of business, but panic that they got to make decisions
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:35.320]  now that they're going to have to live with during the inevitable EV sales boom that is
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]  to come.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.320]  Right?
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:41.460]  Like we only get one chance for that moment where everybody starts buying EVs and stops
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:42.800]  buying gas cars.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.120]  And you better have the right business model when you get there, because you're going to
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.400]  be living that down for the next 20 years.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.400]  Yep.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.400]  All right, Jason.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.400]  Thank you.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:54.040]  I love this too, because I get to say, I'll see you soon.
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.320]  And it's not just looking at you over a little, a little web window here, I'll actually get
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.320]  to see you in person.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.000]  I look forward to it.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.600]  Everybody of course can read your excellent work at the six colors.com.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.800]  And as I always like to say, you can spell colors, however you feel suited to, but you
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:14.760]  can put a U in there and it'll redirect that was a lot cheaper.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.800]  That domain was a lot cheaper to buy than the one that spells it the American way.
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:26.280]  Numerous podcasts, including upgrade where I, I was recently yeah.
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:27.280]  Which was a lot of fun.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  Yeah.
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.280]  It was great having you on there.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.280]  Yeah.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.480]  That's the, for listeners of the talk show, that's probably the most appropriate similar
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:34.480]  podcast you shoot is upgrade.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.080]  If you like this show and you're not listening to upgrade, you're, you're missing out that's
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.080]  I'll just say that.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:43.680]  And of course, everything at the incomparable network, et cetera, et cetera, I will thank
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.480]  our sponsors, our good friends at Squarespace, where you can build your own website and collide,
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:54.320]  which is a cross platform ed point security solution for teams that value privacy and
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:02.120]  transparency and backblaze, which makes backing up and accessing your computer's data astonishingly
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.760]  easy and reliable.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.760]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:32.740]  Yeah, that's a lot of work there.
