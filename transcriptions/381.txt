[00:00.000 --> 00:05.760]  I saw a thread from your wife that you guys, I was threading and I saw that your family
[00:05.760 --> 00:09.820]  had completed a very long road trip.
[00:09.820 --> 00:10.820]  Every year.
[00:10.820 --> 00:11.820]  Well, we do it twice a year.
[00:11.820 --> 00:15.160]  My parents built a house about an hour outside of Buffalo.
[00:15.160 --> 00:21.600]  So it's basically a 450 mile drive with two young children.
[00:21.600 --> 00:23.720]  We used to take the dog and we left him now at home.
[00:23.720 --> 00:25.300]  We can't, poor dog.
[00:25.300 --> 00:31.620]  So browser stays home and yeah, it's six hours plus a stop, so seven hours there and seven
[00:31.620 --> 00:33.280]  hours back.
[00:33.280 --> 00:39.400]  And the killer is that apparently they're not sleeping the car kids.
[00:39.400 --> 00:42.880]  They're not sleeping the car kids, but they're iPad kids.
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.920]  So they both have their iPads.
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.460]  They both, we download a ton of stuff for them and parenting parents of the year.
[00:49.460 --> 00:51.280]  We just, it's iPad the whole time.
[00:51.280 --> 00:54.400]  I don't know what people did before the iPad.
[00:54.400 --> 00:56.080]  I don't know either.
[00:56.080 --> 00:59.480]  And I know you can over, I guess it's like any problem.
[00:59.480 --> 01:05.040]  Everybody thinks the correct amount of iPad time for the kids is the amount of time you
[01:05.040 --> 01:11.600]  grant your kids and the parents who grant more time are the ones who have a problem.
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.740]  And I like my six year old doesn't play that many games on the iPad.
[01:17.740 --> 01:21.060]  So I keep thinking like, well, this is the equivalent of how much TV I watched at six
[01:21.060 --> 01:22.060]  years old.
[01:22.060 --> 01:29.640]  And I keep like justifying it that way.
[01:29.640 --> 01:34.200]  When Jonas was young, Jonas, of course, you're going to be shocked is 19 heading into his
[01:34.200 --> 01:37.140]  sophomore year of college this fall.
[01:37.140 --> 01:42.200]  The problem with Jonas as a traveler was that he either A, would sleep in the backseat,
[01:42.200 --> 01:45.760]  which is the ideal, or he would get carsick.
[01:45.760 --> 01:49.660]  And it was always one or the other.
[01:49.660 --> 01:55.760]  And so we knew like if we had a long car trip, and we check and he wasn't asleep, it's like,
[01:55.760 --> 01:58.200]  wait for it.
[01:58.200 --> 02:07.180]  And luckily, well, I guess one of them Noah has thrown up in the car one or two times.
[02:07.180 --> 02:09.980]  But it's not typically like, I mean, this is also like highway driving.
[02:09.980 --> 02:14.560]  It's not twirly roads around mountains or something like that.
[02:14.560 --> 02:17.520]  Nope, it didn't matter for Jonas.
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.120]  If he didn't fall asleep, you know, and it wouldn't be right away.
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.860]  But like an hour, hour and a half into any car trip.
[02:24.860 --> 02:25.860]  Every time.
[02:25.860 --> 02:28.700]  Yeah, well, I'm always fun.
[02:28.700 --> 02:31.880]  I am working on a EV piece for the summer.
[02:31.880 --> 02:36.840]  And I am about to spend a lot of time in cars by myself.
[02:36.840 --> 02:39.160]  And it actually feels like a vacation.
[02:39.160 --> 02:41.800]  I'm very excited.
[02:41.800 --> 02:44.520]  What can you say?
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.840]  Or is it a spoiler to say which cars you'll be driving?
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.840]  I don't want spoilers.
[02:47.840 --> 02:49.080]  I don't want to break any kind of...
[02:49.080 --> 02:53.520]  Yeah, I won't say which cars I'm driving, though I did put on, I threaded about it yesterday
[02:53.520 --> 02:56.820]  and I tweeted about it yesterday to sort of compare my engagement.
[02:56.820 --> 03:03.480]  But also I was very interested in the responses because this is my journey to buy an EV for
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.480]  my family.
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.580]  But also what I believe is really, this is, I don't want to spoil the column too much,
[03:09.580 --> 03:13.960]  but I think this is widely, we all agree now that buying a car is very much like buying
[03:13.960 --> 03:14.960]  a computer.
[03:14.960 --> 03:18.220]  And so I'm going to test these like computers.
[03:18.220 --> 03:21.200]  So I've narrowed it down four or five cars.
[03:21.200 --> 03:23.640]  I'm still deciding off, I should get one more in.
[03:23.640 --> 03:27.320]  Obviously there's a Tesla, but I won't reveal the others.
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.320]  All right.
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.320]  All right.
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.320]  I look forward to it.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.320]  Do you have one?
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.320]  Do you have a...
[03:32.320 --> 03:42.840]  Well, no, I still drive, we still drive a 2006 Acura TL, 17 years old, has 60,000 miles.
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.000]  I mean, honestly, I laugh really because we live in the city and walk.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.920]  We really are prime people to, we don't really need to own a car, but it's like the times
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.680]  we do want a car, I don't want to have to go rent it.
[03:57.680 --> 03:58.680]  I don't want it.
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.680]  So we use it enough.
[03:59.680 --> 04:04.320]  And Amy used to drive Jonas to school when the weather was in, in Clement.
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.420]  And so we racked up one mile back and forth.
[04:08.420 --> 04:14.880]  I would say half of the 60,000 miles on it are probably one mile trips to school.
[04:14.880 --> 04:15.880]  But otherwise...
[04:15.880 --> 04:18.560]  That's probably like a throwback every time you're in that car, right?
[04:18.560 --> 04:20.560]  Like this has a tape deck?
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.560]  Yeah, it does.
[04:21.560 --> 04:22.560]  It does.
[04:22.560 --> 04:23.560]  Nope.
[04:23.560 --> 04:29.640]  Well, it has a tape deck and a CD player, but our interface to listen to like anything
[04:29.640 --> 04:35.560]  from the phone is one of those tape to headphone jack adapters, which of course then needs
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.320]  a headphone to lightning adapter.
[04:38.320 --> 04:40.960]  Have you talked about this on your show before?
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.240]  Here and there, I'm overdue to buy a car.
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.160]  What I should do, and plus, here's the thing, and I don't want to make it a whole thing
[04:47.160 --> 04:52.280]  about my 17-year-old Acura, but the car has never given me any problems at all.
[04:52.280 --> 04:55.620]  We've never needed anything other than oil changes ever.
[04:55.620 --> 04:57.700]  It is the most reliable car.
[04:57.700 --> 05:02.040]  I've replaced the battery several times, changed the oil when I'm supposed to change the oil,
[05:02.040 --> 05:05.040]  and it just runs and runs and runs, and we don't drive much.
[05:05.040 --> 05:11.560]  But we're obviously overdue, and my wife and son are, I wouldn't say furious, but they're
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.680]  ready for a new car.
[05:14.680 --> 05:18.880]  Let's go back to the fact that you play your music through a tape adapter, through a tape
[05:18.880 --> 05:19.880]  dongle.
[05:19.880 --> 05:21.640]  Yes, a tape dongle.
[05:21.640 --> 05:22.800]  Through a lightning dongle.
[05:22.800 --> 05:23.800]  A double dongle.
[05:23.800 --> 05:29.820]  One of the foremost reviewers of technology and commentators of technology is still using
[05:29.820 --> 05:31.120]  a tape dongle.
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.320]  A $7 thing from Amazon.
[05:34.320 --> 05:36.240]  I actually wore one out.
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.160]  I don't even drive that much, but I had one from long ago, and I remember thinking like,
[05:41.160 --> 05:42.960]  hey, this doesn't even sound that good anymore.
[05:42.960 --> 05:46.940]  And I realized the way those tape adapters work is they just have like a piece of metal
[05:46.940 --> 05:51.880]  in there that's a fake piece of tape that just goes around and around, and it wore out.
[05:51.880 --> 05:57.760]  So I bought a new one, and again, I'll throw hundreds of dollars away on stuff left and
[05:57.760 --> 06:02.640]  right, but I resisted buying the new $7 tape adapter for the car.
[06:02.640 --> 06:10.360]  And as soon as I bought the new one and plugged it in, it sounded fantastic.
[06:10.360 --> 06:13.600]  I should not be in charge of the car for the household.
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.200]  But I don't even think you probably could retrofit that now with a CarPlay screen or
[06:18.200 --> 06:19.200]  something like that.
[06:19.200 --> 06:20.200]  I bet you would do it.
[06:20.200 --> 06:21.200]  You'd have to get one of those.
[06:21.200 --> 06:22.960]  They have the screens that you can mount.
[06:22.960 --> 06:23.960]  No.
[06:23.960 --> 06:28.240]  Well, the funniest part is that when we bought it, we bought it at the end of calendar year
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.400]  2006.
[06:29.400 --> 06:35.060]  So it was like mid-December 2006, and it's a 2006 model year.
[06:35.060 --> 06:39.600]  But we had the option, and Acura, I don't know, again, I haven't shopped for a car in
[06:39.600 --> 06:41.860]  a very long time, so I don't know if it still holds.
[06:41.860 --> 06:48.520]  But one of the nice things about Acura, at least at the time, was they had almost no
[06:48.520 --> 06:50.280]  upgrades at all.
[06:50.280 --> 06:51.640]  Here's the car.
[06:51.640 --> 06:53.200]  This is what it comes with.
[06:53.200 --> 06:58.500]  And we had the choice to get, we could pay, it was, I don't know, like $1,500 to get their
[06:58.500 --> 07:02.800]  mapping solution, which I declined, thinking, ah, the car.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.280]  And of course, I don't even know if that works.
[07:04.280 --> 07:08.960]  What is the 2006 Acura built-in dash mapping thing?
[07:08.960 --> 07:10.520]  I don't know.
[07:10.520 --> 07:11.840]  We wouldn't use it.
[07:11.840 --> 07:17.640]  And the other thing we had the option to buy was, it would cost extra, but it would give
[07:17.640 --> 07:24.760]  us the iPod 30-pin adapter coming out of the glove box.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.440]  And I was like, ooh, that's tempting.
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.360]  But I remember thinking at the time, I don't know if that has legs.
[07:30.360 --> 07:32.480]  It was the same thing when we did our kitchen.
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.160]  They wanted to put USB ports in, and I was correct about this.
[07:36.160 --> 07:38.960]  I was like, USB-A ports are going the way of the dodo.
[07:38.960 --> 07:40.960]  I don't want them in our island.
[07:40.960 --> 07:42.280]  We'll just use plugs.
[07:42.280 --> 07:43.280]  That's the better choice.
[07:43.280 --> 07:45.600]  Well, I'm in the same boat.
[07:45.600 --> 07:51.280]  This house, which we got last year, but was built in 2018, has USB-A plugs in the kitchen,
[07:51.280 --> 07:54.080]  and it's driving me nuts, and I want to swap them.
[07:54.080 --> 08:00.420]  And then in my car, which is a 2020 Volvo, there's a USB-A port.
[08:00.420 --> 08:03.240]  There's no USB-C, and it's driving me nuts.
[08:03.240 --> 08:05.200]  Yeah, that would drive me nuts, too.
[08:05.200 --> 08:09.300]  It came up, we can talk about it as we get to the real business of the show, but when
[08:09.300 --> 08:14.880]  we were talking with people at Apple back at WWDC a month ago about the Vision Pro,
[08:14.880 --> 08:19.840]  and one of the obvious questions every single member of the media asked is, blah, blah,
[08:19.840 --> 08:22.800]  blah, this is going to be great when you're on a flight.
[08:22.800 --> 08:24.880]  But what about the two-hour battery life?
[08:24.880 --> 08:27.560]  Most of the flights I take are more than two hours, and they were like, oh, well, most
[08:27.560 --> 08:30.940]  seatbacks come with USB ports, blah, blah, blah.
[08:30.940 --> 08:36.560]  And my question was, yeah, but there are always USB-A ports, which I think max out at 12 watts
[08:36.560 --> 08:37.560]  charging.
[08:37.560 --> 08:39.640]  Is that going to be enough to keep it going?
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.160]  Because it sounds to me like when you're plugged in, it's going to be like a 30-watt device,
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.760]  and then all of a sudden Apple PR just said, we'll have more to say about that later.
[08:49.760 --> 08:50.760]  We're working on new planes.
[08:50.760 --> 08:51.760]  We're working on new planes.
[08:51.760 --> 08:53.400]  Those are coming soon.
[08:53.400 --> 08:54.400]  Vision planes.
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.040]  No, they, well, I was thinking the same thing, but also I think a couple of us had a conversation
[08:59.040 --> 09:05.720]  about this there, that many flights have the usual three-pin regular outlets, right?
[09:05.720 --> 09:12.000]  So I guess you could travel with your, or you have your plug-in and you also, and or
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.920]  you just buy multiple battery packs to get you through the flight, because when you're
[09:15.920 --> 09:19.640]  spending $3,200 on a headset, why not?
[09:19.640 --> 09:21.320]  Well anyway, I'm in a market for a car.
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.280]  So I actually literally will be looking forward to your review of the EVs.
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.380]  That's a part of the problem too, is that the point where I got fed up with this old
[09:29.380 --> 09:32.200]  car really did coincide with COVID.
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.360]  I'm not trying to make excuses, but then all of a sudden it became impossible to buy a
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.360]  car, right?
[09:36.360 --> 09:40.800]  Both because nobody wanted to go out during COVID, and then there was this tremendous
[09:40.800 --> 09:46.940]  car shortage and the prices went up and it was obviously a seller's market.
[09:46.940 --> 09:51.560]  And now it's like we're on the fence of, I kind of feel like our next car should be,
[09:51.560 --> 09:54.280]  even if we lease, it should be an EV, not a gas car.
[09:54.280 --> 09:55.280]  I think we're there.
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.400]  And we don't really need to drive more than the range of a car.
[09:59.400 --> 10:06.000]  Most of our trips in our extended family are easily under 200 miles round trip.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  So you know.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.640]  Then I think you're the perfect candidate for it.
[10:08.640 --> 10:12.480]  And I think, yeah, I mean, look, I'm convinced it's never a good time to buy a car because
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.840]  even right now when everyone's like, we have the best options, but if you wait till 2024,
[10:16.840 --> 10:18.440]  there's going to be even better options.
[10:18.440 --> 10:19.440]  Right.
[10:19.440 --> 10:20.440]  It's like, well, okay.
[10:20.440 --> 10:23.840]  And I think this is going to be part of the series that I do, but I think I'm going to
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.420]  lease this, hopefully lease this because I think that the EV space is moving so quickly.
[10:28.420 --> 10:29.420]  That's what I'm thinking too.
[10:29.420 --> 10:30.420]  I don't want to be locked in.
[10:30.420 --> 10:31.420]  Yeah.
[10:31.420 --> 10:32.420]  And I just bought our Volvo.
[10:32.420 --> 10:33.420]  So yeah.
[10:33.420 --> 10:35.120]  Anyway, I do think it is like a car talk.
[10:35.120 --> 10:36.120]  It is.
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.120]  It is a car talk show.
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.960]  I'm the worst person to talk about cars with, but well, so am I, I'm the one driving a 17
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.960]  year old car.
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.120]  This, we should have like the world's worst car YouTube channel.
[10:46.120 --> 10:50.960]  Everybody wants to see like these Lamborghini supercars and our show would be about 17 year
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.320]  old Acuras that played music through a tape deck.
[10:54.320 --> 10:55.320]  Seriously.
[10:55.320 --> 11:00.700]  I, I, I call Neil, I Patel every time I have a car question or problem, I'm like, my flat,
[11:00.700 --> 11:01.700]  my tires flat.
[11:01.700 --> 11:02.700]  What do I do?
[11:02.700 --> 11:08.800]  All right, before we get started, let me just knock one of the sponsors out of the way and
[11:08.800 --> 11:09.800]  it's our good friends.
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.240]  I'm going to put them first because I love them and they sponsor us so long for such
[11:13.240 --> 11:16.280]  a long time and it's our good friends at Squarespace.
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.040]  Hey, we're going to talk on this show about lots, all this upheaval in social media and
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.280]  sites that are going on the way down, new sites that are on the way up and there's so
[11:27.280 --> 11:29.000]  much turmoil in that space.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  You know what?
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.620]  The one thing that anybody should do, not just can do, but should do is have your own
[11:35.620 --> 11:42.040]  website and your own domain name where this is like home base for you on the internet
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.880]  and no matter what happens 10 years from now, five years from now, who knows with Twitter,
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.440]  what's going to happen 10 hours from now, but there's somewhere on the web where it's
[11:51.440 --> 11:57.400]  your home base and you can link to all your profiles everywhere else and put it be in
[11:57.400 --> 11:58.400]  control.
[11:58.400 --> 12:04.260]  Honestly, it sounds highfalutin, but of your own destiny online, just take control of it.
[12:04.260 --> 12:09.660]  Squarespace is the all in one solution where you can do everything there from registering
[12:09.660 --> 12:15.060]  your domain name, choosing templates for how you're from incredible, incredible catalog
[12:15.060 --> 12:18.060]  of templates to choose from for how your site looks.
[12:18.060 --> 12:21.500]  You can customize it any way you want.
[12:21.500 --> 12:23.580]  Great pricing, great tech support.
[12:23.580 --> 12:27.640]  It's all self-explanatory though, and you probably won't even need the tech support,
[12:27.640 --> 12:29.200]  but if you do, it's there.
[12:29.200 --> 12:30.280]  It's award-winning.
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.040]  It's real human beings who can answer your questions.
[12:34.040 --> 12:36.160]  All the features you could possibly want in a website.
[12:36.160 --> 12:40.080]  If you want to have a blog, you want to host your own podcast, you want to sell stuff,
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.580]  you want to sell your time.
[12:41.580 --> 12:47.280]  If you're some kind of consultant, you can do it all built in to Squarespace.
[12:47.280 --> 12:53.600]  It is just a fantastic service and it is really having your own website is the way to go.
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.720]  It always has been and it always will be.
[12:55.720 --> 12:58.340]  It's home base on the internet for everybody.
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.480]  Where do you go to find out more?
[12:59.480 --> 13:06.440]  Go to squarespace.com, you get a free trial, but at squarespace.com slash talk show that
[13:06.440 --> 13:11.060]  lets them know you came from this show, you get 10% off your first purchase, but you don't

[13:21.280 --> 13:26.440]  that code talk show, save 10% off your first order.
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.760]  I say we start with the freshest news, we'll work backwards chronologically, but that's
[13:30.760 --> 13:33.880]  talking threads, right?
[13:33.880 --> 13:36.320]  Threads all the way down.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.520]  People seem to miss out.
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.040]  One thing I think people, I've made some people angry who follow me.
[13:42.040 --> 13:43.120]  Shocking.
[13:43.120 --> 13:50.960]  With my enthusiasm for threads in the face of Facebook being a somewhat disreputable
[13:50.960 --> 13:58.560]  company, and to me it's, and or combined with the basic new threads experience being sort
[13:58.560 --> 14:07.320]  of pop culture oriented, but at the very highest level, I don't see how people cannot be impressed
[14:07.320 --> 14:08.320]  by the launch.
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.680]  I think it's technically speaking the most impressive launch in the history of the internet.
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.960]  They had, I don't know, something like 30 million signups in the first day.
[14:16.960 --> 14:20.560]  They hit 100 million signups by day five.
[14:20.560 --> 14:24.480]  I don't think there's ever been any service in the internet that's ever had used user
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.440]  numbers like that so quickly.
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.480]  And while there have been some glitches here and there, for the most part, it's been, it's
[14:30.480 --> 14:31.480]  worked.
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.940]  It hasn't fallen down.
[14:32.940 --> 14:35.680]  From a stability perspective, it's very impressive.
[14:35.680 --> 14:40.460]  I mean, if you think about even how quickly the numbers were rising in that first 24 hours
[14:40.460 --> 14:46.200]  and how many people were not only signing up, but posting and then reposting and uploading
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.140]  images and just think about all the traffic that was happening.
[14:50.140 --> 14:54.400]  And it was tough because I was on vacation last week, so I'd really like to thank Mark
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.480]  Zuckerberg for the perfect timing of this, which obviously we should talk about the timing
[14:58.480 --> 15:08.080]  because it obviously was very rushed for a reason, but I had so much incoming media interest
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.520]  in this and I thought, okay, it's because it's summer and it's a slow news week and
[15:12.520 --> 15:14.640]  they've got nothing else to cover.
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.360]  But then when the numbers started ticking as fast as they did, I was like, oh, okay,
[15:18.360 --> 15:22.400]  this is, there's mainstream interest here, right?
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.480]  Like at first I thought, okay, Twitter clone, yeah, we're back, like, yeah, it's got meta
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.160]  attached to it, so it's bigger than a mastodon and it's bigger than a blue sky.
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.800]  But like, eh, there's not that many people that are that interested in Twitter, to be
[15:34.800 --> 15:36.080]  honest.
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.080]  And then once the numbers started ticking up and you really started to see the number
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.760]  of people that were on it and the types of people that were on it, it really did feel
[15:44.760 --> 15:46.080]  like a big story.
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.760]  And I think absolutely, I stopped my vacation or tried to take parts of my vacation, I wrote
[15:51.760 --> 15:57.320]  a column, I did a lot of TV, and I did that because no one asked me to, but I thought
[15:57.320 --> 16:01.080]  it was one of the biggest product launches of the year, no doubt.
[16:01.080 --> 16:06.280]  I cover product launches, I cover products, and I felt I need to cover this.
[16:06.280 --> 16:07.280]  Right.
[16:07.280 --> 16:08.280]  That's how I feel.
[16:08.280 --> 16:15.760]  I think I'm overall known as a critic of Facebook as a company for the most part.
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.520]  That's just me calling balls and strikes, and that's just how I've seen it over the
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.520]  years.
[16:20.520 --> 16:32.240]  But there's a certain anti-Facebook, almost zealotry contingent who are so emotionally
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.320]  tied up with anti-Facebook feelings, which have foundations.
[16:36.320 --> 16:44.280]  I'm not saying that there isn't reason to have that emotional dislike of the company,
[16:44.280 --> 16:49.880]  but if you want to just step back, and again, be an umpire, just call balls and strikes,
[16:49.880 --> 16:53.220]  whichever team you're rooting for, just call the game as you see it.
[16:53.220 --> 16:56.020]  It's just an incredible launch, it really is.
[16:56.020 --> 17:03.240]  And the timing clearly was, I would guess, based on the state of the app and the shakiness
[17:03.240 --> 17:09.620]  of certain, again, overall uptime is there, but just some things don't load, sometimes
[17:09.620 --> 17:11.680]  you have to pull to refresh again.
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.660]  The website in particular, which doesn't even work as a web app, but for me at least, when
[17:16.660 --> 17:22.360]  I try to just view only somebody's thing on threads, it doesn't load sometimes, you hit
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.300]  reload and then it appears.
[17:24.300 --> 17:25.900]  But clearly, they moved this up.
[17:25.900 --> 17:28.500]  I would guess they were about a month away from launching.
[17:28.500 --> 17:35.200]  It feels to me like they were one month from a super smooth launch, and they saw the turmoil
[17:35.200 --> 17:42.900]  at Twitter last weekend with these goofy rate limits and the nonsensical excuses for them.
[17:42.900 --> 17:49.380]  And you just know what happened inside, that Zuckerberg said, can we launch this week?
[17:49.380 --> 17:50.380]  What do we need to do?
[17:50.380 --> 17:52.420]  What features do we need to pull?
[17:52.420 --> 17:59.500]  Let's strike while the iron's hot and launch this while they're having one of the Elon
[17:59.500 --> 18:00.500]  moments.
[18:00.500 --> 18:06.420]  Yeah, and he had the fodder of the fight happening, I mean, it was just, I had just done a column
[18:06.420 --> 18:09.940]  the week before about the fight, I did a video recapping what this fight was about.
[18:09.940 --> 18:15.820]  I mean, obviously, even the fight being ticked off was a thread or sorry, not actually a
[18:15.820 --> 18:19.620]  thread, a Twitter thread about threads.
[18:19.620 --> 18:24.540]  And so there was there was all this chatter around this in the media.
[18:24.540 --> 18:29.020]  And then absolutely that weekend with the rate limit, and more people saying, screw
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.700]  Elon, screw Twitter.
[18:30.700 --> 18:33.220]  And yeah, I think they were a few weeks out from the launch.
[18:33.220 --> 18:38.700]  I mean, what I can tell you is I had been talking to the company about covering this.
[18:38.700 --> 18:43.180]  And I had sort of been assured this was not going to happen while I was on vacation, right?
[18:43.180 --> 18:46.020]  And then I start getting texts and emails on vacation.
[18:46.020 --> 18:50.620]  So yeah, and from what I understand, and I think that's how product launches typically
[18:50.620 --> 18:57.840]  go, is it's a, especially by Facebook standards, a relatively small team has been designing
[18:57.840 --> 19:04.140]  and engineering the app, or apps, because there's Android and iPhone and the back end.
[19:04.140 --> 19:09.780]  But by their standards, a relatively small team launching during not just any holiday
[19:09.780 --> 19:16.740]  weekend, but when July four hits on like a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, you kind of
[19:16.740 --> 19:18.780]  get like a de facto five day.
[19:18.780 --> 19:20.020]  Yep, weekend.
[19:20.020 --> 19:24.940]  I mean, Ben Thompson and I took off last week for for dithering because we thought nothing's
[19:24.940 --> 19:28.020]  going to happen when Ben's traveling, we're like, yeah, this will be one of the weeks
[19:28.020 --> 19:29.260]  where we don't do a show.
[19:29.260 --> 19:30.260]  Yep.
[19:30.260 --> 19:32.000]  Of course, there's tons to talk about.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.220]  But they obviously said all hands on deck.
[19:34.220 --> 19:35.760]  We're sorry, it's a holiday weekend.
[19:35.760 --> 19:37.680]  But this is the moment to strike.
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.840]  And in some ways, obviously, if it affects your job, like you who were on vacation, me
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.860]  who at least half of my job or part of my job with dithering was off for the week, but
[19:47.860 --> 19:54.820]  kind of sucks that it happened in a July 4 week, but in some ways for for just users
[19:54.820 --> 19:55.820]  with nothing.
[19:55.820 --> 19:56.820]  Yeah.
[19:56.820 --> 19:57.820]  With nothing else going on.
[19:57.820 --> 19:58.820]  Right.
[19:58.820 --> 20:01.940]  I mean, even for me, because I was on vacation, I said, I'm gonna write the column, I'll do
[20:01.940 --> 20:05.320]  my my media hits, I do my NBC, CNBC stuff.
[20:05.320 --> 20:06.680]  But otherwise, like I'm offline.
[20:06.680 --> 20:10.280]  But of course, you have time on vacation at night, my kids are sleeping, I'm spending
[20:10.280 --> 20:12.820]  more time on threads, I'm not working on stuff.
[20:12.820 --> 20:17.320]  I'm sitting on the beach, sure, I should be reading a book or more maybe watching my kids,
[20:17.320 --> 20:20.080]  but I'm on threads looking at what's happening on threads.
[20:20.080 --> 20:23.320]  As long as they don't drown, you're doing a good job.
[20:23.320 --> 20:26.760]  Just keep an eye keep an eye on screaming, he's still here.
[20:26.760 --> 20:32.280]  The other thing is, I know that there are people who feel I like Mastodon, I use it
[20:32.280 --> 20:35.400]  more than I use any of these other services right now.
[20:35.400 --> 20:43.560]  And and I it's part of me, what I see as my job, and I know you do too is separating your
[20:43.560 --> 20:51.560]  personal taste and what you want to do from objectively reviewing things or describing
[20:51.560 --> 20:54.520]  things that might not be for you.
[20:54.520 --> 20:55.520]  Right.
[20:55.520 --> 21:01.160]  So Mastodon Mastodon is more up my speed, if I could only use one of these Twitter like
[21:01.160 --> 21:06.120]  services for the next year, I would pick Mastodon right now, just because that's where lots
[21:06.120 --> 21:08.920]  and lots of Daring Fireball readers are.
[21:08.920 --> 21:15.040]  It's a very high engagement engagement I did just a couple months ago, I just just to test
[21:15.040 --> 21:16.040]  the waters.
[21:16.040 --> 21:17.620]  I forget what I asked.
[21:17.620 --> 21:21.600]  It was a pretty good question, like up some nerdy question.
[21:21.600 --> 21:27.580]  But I asked the same poll on Mastodon and Twitter, and got slightly more responses on
[21:27.580 --> 21:32.120]  Mastodon than Twitter, even though if you look at how many people supposedly follow
[21:32.120 --> 21:36.000]  me on Twitter, it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands more.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  But those aren't real people.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  There's aren't real people.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.840]  No, I did the same thing yesterday with that EV post, I just said, let me let me because
[21:41.840 --> 21:47.520]  I actually really did want to hear from the audience and from readers and anyone about
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.920]  how you judge a new car decision decision, a buying decision.
[21:51.920 --> 21:54.020]  And on, let me see if I find my numbers.
[21:54.020 --> 22:00.480]  But on Twitter, I got 120 responses by end of day, maybe six hours or something.
[22:00.480 --> 22:04.560]  And then on threads, I had 70 or 80 responses.
[22:04.560 --> 22:08.440]  And on threads, I don't even have like, you know, what percentage of the Twitter followers
[22:08.440 --> 22:10.320]  I have not even there yet.
[22:10.320 --> 22:13.040]  But the engagement is really is really there.
[22:13.040 --> 22:16.480]  And I'm sure if I did it on Mastodon too, I would have gotten some really quality good
[22:16.480 --> 22:17.720]  engaged responses.
[22:17.720 --> 22:18.720]  Right.
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.160]  But there's it's obvious, though.
[22:20.160 --> 22:25.200]  And part of what I like about Mastodon is my tribe is there.
[22:25.200 --> 22:29.920]  People who, you know, when they find out Joanna Stern is back on the talk show, they're excited.
[22:29.920 --> 22:30.920]  Right?
[22:30.920 --> 22:33.480]  Well, yeah, we got badgered there a few months ago, right for not.
[22:33.480 --> 22:34.480]  We did.
[22:34.480 --> 22:35.480]  Right.
[22:35.480 --> 22:36.480]  And they were like, you forgot.
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.040]  And they kind of like held their feet to the fire on somebody, a couple people chimed in,
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.120]  they were very upset that I had let 12 months come and go without having you on the show.
[22:44.120 --> 22:46.680]  And I thought there's no way that happened.
[22:46.680 --> 22:48.080]  And I was about to tell them off.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.300]  And then I looked at the show.
[22:49.300 --> 22:53.520]  And I was like, huh, it has been 14 months, I really and I apologize, you you saw me do
[22:53.520 --> 22:54.520]  it.
[22:54.520 --> 22:55.520]  I was like, I'm sorry.
[22:55.520 --> 22:56.520]  I will run.
[22:56.520 --> 23:00.240]  I will say that's not on for those that are listening.
[23:00.240 --> 23:03.800]  That's not only on john, he will often text and say, let's do it.
[23:03.800 --> 23:05.460]  And then I am busy.
[23:05.460 --> 23:06.460]  And I let it fall.
[23:06.460 --> 23:08.880]  And I've got to find two hours block of time.
[23:08.880 --> 23:11.680]  And so this is just as much on me as it is on you.
[23:11.680 --> 23:16.720]  But it's there's no doubt in either of our minds that the mastodon audience is not the
[23:16.720 --> 23:19.420]  general population of the internet.
[23:19.420 --> 23:21.920]  It's it, it just isn't.
[23:21.920 --> 23:24.120]  It's dwarfed already.
[23:24.120 --> 23:27.140]  It certainly never approached the size of Twitter's user base.
[23:27.140 --> 23:30.220]  And I don't trust Twitter's numbers anymore on their active users.
[23:30.220 --> 23:35.240]  But clearly they have hunt over 100 million active users.
[23:35.240 --> 23:40.020]  And blue sky, which I really like as a product, I really like the team.
[23:40.020 --> 23:41.340]  I like their philosophy.
[23:41.340 --> 23:42.760]  I love so much about it.
[23:42.760 --> 23:49.700]  I think that their idea of having custom feeds built into the protocol where you can pick.
[23:49.700 --> 23:52.940]  So you can say I just want a chronological timeline.
[23:52.940 --> 23:56.360]  That's not like just one binary feature.
[23:56.360 --> 24:01.120]  If you want an algorithmic timeline, you're going to you already can while it's in testing
[24:01.120 --> 24:06.000]  and private limited release, you can choose from different algorithms.
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.040]  You can choose one where it's just links that your that your people you follow have posted.
[24:11.040 --> 24:15.820]  If you just want to find good links, you can go for their what's hot, which is sort of
[24:15.820 --> 24:20.860]  their idea of just a generic engaging thing.
[24:20.860 --> 24:27.620]  But I love and individual users can define their own algorithm for a timeline and then
[24:27.620 --> 24:31.020]  you can pick and choose from them in your settings.
[24:31.020 --> 24:36.260]  So somebody can put together one if you're really into baseball, you can pick like a
[24:36.260 --> 24:40.620]  baseball oriented feed and it could be one of your timelines or if you're really into
[24:40.620 --> 24:45.560]  Taylor Swift, there could be like a timeline that is just sort of optimized for it and
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.560]  you don't have to try to catch which hashtags or something people are using.
[24:49.560 --> 24:55.620]  It's it's all brilliant, but their invitation only on blue sky and right now as they're
[24:55.620 --> 24:58.100]  continue to expand their 50,000 users.
[24:58.100 --> 25:05.940]  It's a drop in the bucket compared to Twitter and threads going from zero to 100 million
[25:05.940 --> 25:09.560]  in five days and continuing to grow.
[25:09.560 --> 25:14.380]  So by the time the show comes out later tonight, it'll probably be like 110, 120 million.
[25:14.380 --> 25:17.780]  I don't know, but you can see it in the timeline.
[25:17.780 --> 25:23.180]  It's palpable that that there are lots and lots of people there like Twitter and there's
[25:23.180 --> 25:28.300]  so there's never been for this this format of social media.
[25:28.300 --> 25:33.420]  There was Twitter that had 100 million plus people and now there's now there's finally
[25:33.420 --> 25:38.980]  a second one that has that sort of base of people.
[25:38.980 --> 25:44.280]  And of course, I mean, as you were saying before, right, we all have our issues with
[25:44.280 --> 25:50.300]  Facebook or meta over the years, we've covered them, we've seen all of the missteps.
[25:50.300 --> 25:57.940]  And is it fair that meta, this company that's built over 3 billion users by acquiring companies
[25:57.940 --> 26:04.060]  and building and building and building their monopoly over social media basically can just
[26:04.060 --> 26:09.700]  point Instagram at this and just say, hey, go to town?
[26:09.700 --> 26:13.780]  Fair, probably not.
[26:13.780 --> 26:22.340]  But does it create a mass audience and onboard them in such a quick way that we can find
[26:22.340 --> 26:27.460]  people to communicate with and to chat with and to share with almost instantly?
[26:27.460 --> 26:28.460]  Yes.
[26:28.460 --> 26:32.260]  And so that creates a better product because social media is only as good as the people
[26:32.260 --> 26:33.260]  that are there.
[26:33.260 --> 26:40.620]  And it's really telling to me and I know people's reaction to the feed.
[26:40.620 --> 26:44.580]  And for me, at least, I don't know about for you, when I signed up, I happened to be paying
[26:44.580 --> 26:45.580]  attention.
[26:45.580 --> 26:47.220]  You were on vacation, so maybe you missed it early.
[26:47.220 --> 26:54.240]  But I was paying attention last Wednesday, when I think whatever the day of the week
[26:54.240 --> 26:58.900]  it was when they actually went live, and they had been scheduled to go live on the next
[26:58.900 --> 27:01.380]  day and they moved it up 12 hours.
[27:01.380 --> 27:05.260]  So you just know that Zuckerberg said, let's launch as soon as we're ready.
[27:05.260 --> 27:07.980]  Somebody said, I think we can do it Thursday.
[27:07.980 --> 27:12.220]  They got to Wednesday and they're like, hey, Zuck, I think we could go tonight.
[27:12.220 --> 27:13.540]  And he's like, all right, let's do it.
[27:13.540 --> 27:14.780]  And then they moved the clock up.
[27:14.780 --> 27:15.780]  They went live.
[27:15.780 --> 27:17.940]  I downloaded the app.
[27:17.940 --> 27:22.740]  I said import from Instagram and boom.
[27:22.740 --> 27:27.180]  They're telling you what user number you are if you go to your Instagram profile.
[27:27.180 --> 27:30.260]  And that's how people can track how many signups there are.
[27:30.260 --> 27:33.980]  I think my number is like 28,000, I don't know, 40,000.
[27:33.980 --> 27:35.100]  It's pretty low.
[27:35.100 --> 27:40.420]  But right away, and I just said, let me follow all the same people I follow on Instagram.
[27:40.420 --> 27:43.940]  I only follow like 299 people on Instagram, something like that.
[27:43.940 --> 27:47.940]  So it's not a lot, mostly a lot of people I know personally.
[27:47.940 --> 27:51.780]  And I saw a bunch of them, no surprise, a bunch of the people I follow on Instagram
[27:51.780 --> 27:55.740]  are nerds who would jump on threads the day it launched.
[27:55.740 --> 27:56.860]  And some of them were there.
[27:56.860 --> 27:58.860]  And then there was lots of stuff in my timeline.
[27:58.860 --> 28:04.380]  There's only one timeline in threads, and it is right now, for now, it's algorithmic.
[28:04.380 --> 28:11.820]  They filled in the gaps with lots of stuff from brands and celebrities and the type of
[28:11.820 --> 28:17.340]  things you'd expect from Instagram on a text-only thing like threads.
[28:17.340 --> 28:23.340]  But I would say by the end of the night, it was already much, much more to my interest.
[28:23.340 --> 28:28.360]  They dialed it in, and now I mostly see stuff from the people I choose to follow.
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.420]  It's not, I don't see a lot of algorithmic junk food.
[28:33.420 --> 28:34.740]  It depends for me.
[28:34.740 --> 28:39.980]  And I feel like, I mean, this is where I feel like it's just an algorithmic black box in
[28:39.980 --> 28:40.980]  a way.
[28:40.980 --> 28:45.480]  But then on the other hand, stuff will start to populate that I don't care about, right?
[28:45.480 --> 28:50.660]  And then I'll kind of have to reset it a little bit by engaging with some of the stuff I do
[28:50.660 --> 28:53.140]  care about.
[28:53.140 --> 28:59.420]  I don't know how it got to me, but it was actually an amazing post by Paris Hilton.
[28:59.420 --> 29:05.300]  I re-threaded it, if that's the right word, but she had shared photos of her old cell
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.300]  phones.
[29:06.300 --> 29:07.300]  Did you see this?
[29:07.300 --> 29:09.300]  No, I did not, but I'll look for it.
[29:09.300 --> 29:13.260]  And it showed up in the thread in my main feed, and I was like, I don't care about Paris
[29:13.260 --> 29:14.260]  Hilton.
[29:14.260 --> 29:19.500]  But I actually really did care about the fact that she was sharing what is an odd godly
[29:19.500 --> 29:26.540]  amount of old blackberries, some are bedazzled, oh, she's got an old sidekick in there that's
[29:26.540 --> 29:29.940]  bedazzled from the ad she was in.
[29:29.940 --> 29:31.540]  And I'm thinking, why is this in my feed?
[29:31.540 --> 29:36.020]  But then I engaged with it, and then I couldn't stop seeing Paris Hilton in my feed, right?
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.340]  So I had to kind of reset it.
[29:37.340 --> 29:42.220]  I had to go back and engage with some of the stuff that were tech type of people.
[29:42.220 --> 29:46.580]  For some reason, I mean, not for some reason, but like, I can't get anything that Zuckerberg
[29:46.580 --> 29:50.180]  or Missouri, whatever they say is in the feed.
[29:50.180 --> 29:55.320]  I'm assuming because of people in my graph, like all are resharing those things and engaging
[29:55.320 --> 29:57.080]  with those things.
[29:57.080 --> 30:00.780]  But as of right now, I'm going through and my whole feed is about the Microsoft Activision
[30:00.780 --> 30:01.780]  stuff.
[30:01.780 --> 30:04.260]  So I mean, it's right before pretty much there.
[30:04.260 --> 30:10.100]  Right before we started recording the I guess it's not official, the ink hasn't been signed,
[30:10.100 --> 30:17.060]  but the lawsuit the FCC registered to try to halt the acquisition was declined.
[30:17.060 --> 30:22.340]  So Microsoft's acquisition of Activision will go through my threads feed similarly
[30:22.340 --> 30:25.660]  carries that news, which is interesting, right?
[30:25.660 --> 30:31.220]  Because one of the things people and again, there's lots of for all the bad things we
[30:31.220 --> 30:37.200]  can say about Twitter, even before Musk, certainly after Musk, it still has been a place for
[30:37.200 --> 30:45.260]  breaking news, and, and is threads going to take over that even though they're admitting
[30:45.260 --> 30:50.260]  Adam Mosseri and Zuckerberg both have said that they're they're trying, they're trying
[30:50.260 --> 30:55.740]  to tune the algorithm to keep it a sort of upbeat, cheerful place.
[30:55.740 --> 31:01.740]  And in my opinion, so far, it is that kind of makes it the complaint I could see being
[31:01.740 --> 31:04.580]  registered against it is that it's it.
[31:04.580 --> 31:09.220]  You could see it as vapid, but they're, yeah, they're, they're not discouraging people from
[31:09.220 --> 31:14.940]  posting news, but they've said, we're not going to over index on news in terms of what
[31:14.940 --> 31:16.140]  we promote.
[31:16.140 --> 31:21.940]  But here with this Microsoft Activision thing, it's of my interest, I want to see it.
[31:21.940 --> 31:23.900]  And I'm getting it in threads.
[31:23.900 --> 31:29.780]  Yeah, and I think it's, I think it's like, I'm trying to go back and forth between Twitter.
[31:29.780 --> 31:34.000]  And yeah, I mean, I've got the Activision news in my Twitter feed as well.
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.700]  There's no way to keep it some social media utopia.
[31:36.700 --> 31:37.700]  There's just no way.
[31:37.700 --> 31:41.180]  I mean, even even for me, which I have to say, I've been very lucky.
[31:41.180 --> 31:43.300]  I think, sir, I've got haters on the internet.
[31:43.300 --> 31:47.180]  I've got haters in the tech community, people don't believe certain things I've said over
[31:47.180 --> 31:53.100]  the years, whatever, maybe you want to be harsh that can be I, I have heard from some
[31:53.100 --> 31:55.920]  of them on threads already, right?
[31:55.920 --> 32:03.380]  There's nothing you can do to keep out people from just being who they are often.
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.940]  This is like social media, right?
[32:04.940 --> 32:07.740]  This is humanity.
[32:07.740 --> 32:13.300]  But I think, I think we'll see where they where they might roll out trending topics
[32:13.300 --> 32:19.900]  and how they try to structure things will be very telling about how they want to keep
[32:19.900 --> 32:23.140]  the conversation where they'd like to keep the conversation.
[32:23.140 --> 32:27.900]  And I've heard there's there's certainly a lot of thought around the fact that hey, Facebook
[32:27.900 --> 32:31.020]  screwed over the news industry many times.
[32:31.020 --> 32:32.520]  And so they don't want to repeat that.
[32:32.520 --> 32:37.860]  They don't want to promise this as a new news platform where everyone should come and there'll
[32:37.860 --> 32:41.860]  be monetization for news platforms and news organizations.
[32:41.860 --> 32:46.700]  I think they just want to say hey, right now this is a place for having conversation.
[32:46.700 --> 32:51.080]  We want the conversation to be nice because also hey, the conversation on that other place
[32:51.080 --> 32:53.300]  Twitter not so nice.
[32:53.300 --> 32:57.520]  Ryan Broderick, he writes the excellent newsletter garbage day.
[32:57.520 --> 33:04.060]  I think people know garbage day better than his name but he his his hot take on threads.
[33:04.060 --> 33:09.580]  I don't want to quote it too much but more or less he thinks it's garbage.
[33:09.580 --> 33:10.580]  He doesn't like it.
[33:10.580 --> 33:15.860]  He had a bunch of good good jokes about what type of nonsense is in there and it but one
[33:15.860 --> 33:23.360]  of his throwaway jokes was that it's the Ellen show the Ellen DeGeneres show on on the web
[33:23.360 --> 33:25.720]  as as a putdown.
[33:25.720 --> 33:30.300]  And somebody forget who showed me that and and sort of linked to it like hey, this is
[33:30.300 --> 33:31.940]  a good take on threads.
[33:31.940 --> 33:40.260]  But my take on that is Ellen Ellen DeGeneres is daytime show was on for 19 years, which
[33:40.260 --> 33:42.800]  is impossible at TV.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.460]  People love Ellen DeGeneres.
[33:45.460 --> 33:47.980]  People loved her show.
[33:47.980 --> 33:50.540]  And was it was it 60 minutes?
[33:50.540 --> 33:52.100]  Was it hard hitting news?
[33:52.100 --> 33:55.360]  No, it was like hey, I it's four o'clock in the afternoon.
[33:55.360 --> 33:59.580]  And I want to watch something see some movie stars talking about their new movie and hear
[33:59.580 --> 34:05.580]  Ellen crack some funny jokes and 19 years people love Ellen DeGeneres and loved her
[34:05.580 --> 34:06.580]  show.
[34:06.580 --> 34:13.060]  So being able to have that vibe on a social network is, to me a sign that it is going
[34:13.060 --> 34:18.260]  to be successful and has the potential not to be a flash in the pan, but to have legs
[34:18.260 --> 34:19.900]  for a long time.
[34:19.900 --> 34:21.060]  Agreed.
[34:21.060 --> 34:25.260]  And I think look, there's going to be no way to keep it out when there is a big national
[34:25.260 --> 34:26.700]  news moment.
[34:26.700 --> 34:29.340]  It is going to flood the zone here.
[34:29.340 --> 34:31.800]  There's just no way there's no way to keep it out.
[34:31.800 --> 34:34.100]  It's gonna it's gonna happen.
[34:34.100 --> 34:42.100]  I think the other huge, huge sign of legs for this platform are the number of and I
[34:42.100 --> 34:49.660]  there's an overlap between which is brands like Wendy's is threading up a store.
[34:49.660 --> 34:53.480]  All sorts of brands are already there, you know, and they're cracking jokes.
[34:53.480 --> 34:59.980]  There's there's the whole thing where one brand is getting in a back and forth with
[34:59.980 --> 35:06.100]  another of totally unrelated industries, you know, Wendy's I had this example making up
[35:06.100 --> 35:11.980]  but Wendy's cracking jokes at United Airlines and United Airlines back.
[35:11.980 --> 35:17.100]  And of course, the social media accounts for these major brands aren't cracking.
[35:17.100 --> 35:18.100]  Good jokes.
[35:18.100 --> 35:19.580]  They're they're dad jokes, right?
[35:19.580 --> 35:22.340]  They're they're they're corny.
[35:22.340 --> 35:24.700]  But people like that, right?
[35:24.700 --> 35:26.480]  It's do people love it?
[35:26.480 --> 35:30.380]  Does anybody out there really think this is seriously great content?
[35:30.380 --> 35:36.200]  No, but people are mildly amused when the Wendy's account cracks, cracks a joke.
[35:36.200 --> 35:39.740]  It just it's I don't know, it's just good fun.
[35:39.740 --> 35:44.620]  But they are there on threads and they are not there on Twitter anymore.
[35:44.620 --> 35:45.620]  Right?
[35:45.620 --> 35:51.120]  The brands that are left on Twitter are few and far between I wrote about Apple still
[35:51.120 --> 35:55.820]  using Twitter to promote like they used it to promote that they put the whole first episode
[35:55.820 --> 36:01.760]  of their TV show silo on Twitter as an embedded video that you could watch.
[36:01.760 --> 36:04.980]  And I'm not, you know, at the end of my piece about I was like, is this called reason for
[36:04.980 --> 36:08.020]  outrage that Apple is still active on Twitter?
[36:08.020 --> 36:09.900]  No, it's not outrageous.
[36:09.900 --> 36:17.120]  But it is a little curious because they are one of the most carefully curated brands in
[36:17.120 --> 36:23.460]  the world and Twitter is sort of a bad neighborhood for brands right now.
[36:23.460 --> 36:26.840]  Threads is very, very friendly to big brands.
[36:26.840 --> 36:31.540]  And then that where I was going before, and again, the same thing for us.
[36:31.540 --> 36:32.860]  They're already on Instagram.
[36:32.860 --> 36:33.860]  Yep.
[36:33.860 --> 36:34.860]  Yep.
[36:34.860 --> 36:36.180]  Well, so it's an easy port over and it's easy.
[36:36.180 --> 36:38.900]  Hey, let's let's see what we can do here with some of our followers.
[36:38.900 --> 36:39.900]  Yes.
[36:39.900 --> 36:41.020]  I think it's related to brands.
[36:41.020 --> 36:44.620]  So there's corporate brands, and then there's celebrity brands, right?
[36:44.620 --> 36:52.060]  But celebrities are their sports stars, movie stars, Oprah, Oprah's there, they still the
[36:52.060 --> 36:58.140]  to me, the gold standard for a celebrity who's going to embrace your platform.
[36:58.140 --> 36:59.140]  Oprah's there.
[36:59.140 --> 37:03.140]  And it sounds to me from her threads, it's her typing them.
[37:03.140 --> 37:04.480]  It sounds like Oprah.
[37:04.480 --> 37:07.140]  It's not just, you know, I mean, I'm sure
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.540]  I have a big question for you.
[37:08.540 --> 37:09.540]  Okay.
[37:09.540 --> 37:11.060]  Did John Cena follow you?
[37:11.060 --> 37:12.060]  Oh, I don't know.
[37:12.060 --> 37:15.500]  I haven't, I've lost, I've got enough followers where I've stopped looking at everybody who
[37:15.500 --> 37:16.500]  follows me.
[37:16.500 --> 37:17.500]  Let me see.
[37:17.500 --> 37:18.500]  I sometimes scroll through.
[37:18.500 --> 37:20.380]  Also, nice humble brag about all your followers.
[37:20.380 --> 37:23.820]  Let me take a look at how many you have.
[37:23.820 --> 37:26.660]  Also, if you're listening to this, please follow me so I can get more followers than
[37:26.660 --> 37:27.660]  John.
[37:27.660 --> 37:28.660]  Thank you.
[37:28.660 --> 37:29.660]  All right.
[37:29.660 --> 37:30.660]  Hold on.
[37:30.660 --> 37:31.660]  Let's see.
[37:31.660 --> 37:32.660]  You've got 13.6 thousand.
[37:32.660 --> 37:33.660]  I've got 17.
[37:33.660 --> 37:34.660]  17.
[37:34.660 --> 37:35.660]  Okay.
[37:35.660 --> 37:38.780]  That's a gap I can close.
[37:38.780 --> 37:39.780]  You know what?
[37:39.780 --> 37:40.980]  You're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna catch me.
[37:40.980 --> 37:41.980]  I'll catch you.
[37:41.980 --> 37:42.980]  That's fine.
[37:42.980 --> 37:48.940]  But John Cena seems to have followed a lot of verified people.
[37:48.940 --> 37:50.460]  I'm not verified on Instagram.
[37:50.460 --> 37:51.460]  You're not verified?
[37:51.460 --> 37:52.460]  Yeah.
[37:52.460 --> 37:53.460]  Okay.
[37:53.460 --> 37:56.220]  So I like woke up the other morning and I was just looking because, you know, it pops
[37:56.220 --> 37:57.220]  up in the thing.
[37:57.220 --> 37:58.220]  It's in your main feed.
[37:58.220 --> 38:03.140]  It will say like one, two users and then other users followed you.
[38:03.140 --> 38:05.380]  I'm looking at his following list.
[38:05.380 --> 38:08.900]  He is following 7,500 people.
[38:08.900 --> 38:12.380]  And but no, but I'm special, he just wanted my tech.
[38:12.380 --> 38:13.380]  All right.
[38:13.380 --> 38:14.380]  Analysis.
[38:14.380 --> 38:15.380]  Okay.
[38:15.380 --> 38:16.380]  But listen to this.
[38:16.380 --> 38:17.600]  This is how good Facebook is at this stuff.
[38:17.600 --> 38:20.340]  So I go to John Cena's profile.
[38:20.340 --> 38:22.180]  It says he has 1 million followers.
[38:22.180 --> 38:27.740]  You tap that and then you get a new panel that shows you who his followers are.
[38:27.740 --> 38:29.860]  Now what am I going to do with a list of a million people?
[38:29.860 --> 38:34.980]  But if I go to the following tab, in other words, I can see who he follows.
[38:34.980 --> 38:37.060]  They don't just show them in a random order.
[38:37.060 --> 38:39.540]  They show them in a Facebook algorithmic order.
[38:39.540 --> 38:43.100]  Now let me read the list in order from top to bottom.
[38:43.100 --> 38:45.940]  Number one, Matthew Panzerino.
[38:45.940 --> 38:48.620]  Number two, Austin Mann, the photographer.
[38:48.620 --> 38:49.620]  I know him personally.
[38:49.620 --> 38:50.620]  He's a friend.
[38:50.620 --> 38:57.140]  He's the guy who Apple often sends like to Africa with a new iPhone to test out the camera
[38:57.140 --> 39:00.340]  shooting chimpanzees or lions or something like that.
[39:00.340 --> 39:04.060]  Number three, somebody named Joanna Stern.
[39:04.060 --> 39:10.000]  Number four, Mike Mattis, former designer at Apple now doing work at Love From and other
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  places.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  M.G.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  Siegler, my friend Craig.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  Let's not do this.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  I know.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  But it's just making me feel bad.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.900]  I was super excited about my John Cena follow and then it turns out he's just following
[39:19.900 --> 39:22.980]  everyone in the tech community and really anyone on threads.
[39:22.980 --> 39:25.220]  But how good is that list?
[39:25.220 --> 39:30.300]  For me to spot somebody who I might want to follow who I'm not following yet, that list
[39:30.300 --> 39:33.460]  of the people he's following is fantastic.
[39:33.460 --> 39:36.100]  We've got Matthew Panzerino just got a follow from me.
[39:36.100 --> 39:37.100]  Yeah.
[39:37.100 --> 39:38.500]  They didn't know I wasn't following him.
[39:38.500 --> 39:44.340]  They again, put aside your feelings about their ethics, which to me to put it in Dungeons
[39:44.340 --> 39:49.100]  and Dragons terms, I think the problem with Facebook is not that they're an evil company.
[39:49.100 --> 39:53.460]  I think the problem all along from the get go is that they are just neutral.
[39:53.460 --> 39:56.940]  There are certain nobody's going to say Facebook has been a force for good in the world.
[39:56.940 --> 39:58.100]  But they're not evil.
[39:58.100 --> 40:06.580]  They're just neutral and the way that they've gotten into trouble with what they promote
[40:06.580 --> 40:13.420]  and what they've done, what they've optimized for engagement is just by being detached from
[40:13.420 --> 40:17.500]  the morality of it and just, well, if this is going to increase our engagement, we should
[40:17.500 --> 40:18.500]  do it.
[40:18.500 --> 40:20.280]  How am I excusing it?
[40:20.280 --> 40:27.220]  I'm just saying put aside those ethics though and just think about their technical chops.
[40:27.220 --> 40:32.300]  The way that they can sort a list of 7,500 people he's following and it's instantly the
[40:32.300 --> 40:36.900]  list of people who I know and would want to follow, it's amazing.
[40:36.900 --> 40:43.320]  And I think it's not a beautiful moment, but it is a moment right now where it's a decade
[40:43.320 --> 40:45.460]  plus into social media.
[40:45.460 --> 40:53.460]  We have learned so much about how these systems are built, the algorithms, the misinformation,
[40:53.460 --> 40:58.220]  the engagement, the growth hacking, all of the stuff we've learned in the last decade
[40:58.220 --> 40:59.740]  plus.
[40:59.740 --> 41:05.400]  And yet we're sitting here loving a new social media service that's largely built on everything
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.300]  we've learned and said we hated over the last decade plus.
[41:10.300 --> 41:11.300]  It's kind of amazing.
[41:11.300 --> 41:19.060]  I mean, and as I'm trying to do the same thing as you here, I'm not trying to assign bias
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.600]  or preference here.
[41:20.600 --> 41:25.220]  Just look at the picture of what we're at right now.
[41:25.220 --> 41:30.580]  The top brands in my list, I have to get down to around 10 before it becomes individuals,
[41:30.580 --> 41:35.420]  is New Yorker magazine, which I love, I'm going to follow them, letterboxed the app
[41:35.420 --> 41:40.780]  you use for reviewing movies, and then the next brand on my list is the Wall Street Journal.
[41:40.780 --> 41:43.180]  Again, excellent taste.
[41:43.180 --> 41:44.180]  Excellent taste.
[41:44.180 --> 41:45.180]  Yeah.
[41:45.180 --> 41:46.180]  It's really amazing.
[41:46.180 --> 41:47.180]  Yeah, I'm with you though.
[41:47.180 --> 41:53.520]  I think this is like from a pure technology product launch, this is extremely well done.
[41:53.520 --> 41:56.860]  And I really believe it's been a big year of product launches.
[41:56.860 --> 41:59.260]  I was thinking about how busy I've been this year.
[41:59.260 --> 42:03.820]  We've had more recently the Vision Pro, we had Bing back in February.
[42:03.820 --> 42:09.460]  These are big product launches and this one ranks right up there maybe at the top of it.
[42:09.460 --> 42:13.980]  Because when you think about the number of users and how the engagement, I mean, if you
[42:13.980 --> 42:15.940]  look at it from that point of view, it is the biggest.
[42:15.940 --> 42:20.500]  Yeah, I think it counts as the big, I've described it as the most interesting and most fun launch
[42:20.500 --> 42:21.820]  of the year.
[42:21.820 --> 42:23.540]  Because I don't think Vision Pro counts.
[42:23.540 --> 42:25.720]  It's a pre-launch, right?
[42:25.720 --> 42:26.720]  We don't have it yet.
[42:26.720 --> 42:28.260]  It won't be until next year.
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.260]  Yeah.
[42:29.260 --> 42:31.580]  If you think about big companies this year, right?
[42:31.580 --> 42:35.540]  You've had Microsoft with its AI and Bing and OpenAI partnership.
[42:35.540 --> 42:39.900]  You've had Apple with a brand new platform, Vision Pro, right?
[42:39.900 --> 42:42.260]  You have meta now with this.
[42:42.260 --> 42:44.700]  I don't know what Amazon does this year.
[42:44.700 --> 42:46.140]  I don't know what Google really does.
[42:46.140 --> 42:50.900]  You could say Google's, Google I.O. around everything AI, but I don't think it's looking
[42:50.900 --> 42:55.900]  very good for Google this year when you think about their sort of even mind share.
[42:55.900 --> 42:56.900]  Yeah.
[42:56.900 --> 42:59.260]  Yeah, I agree.
[42:59.260 --> 43:00.260]  It's a big year.
[43:00.260 --> 43:01.420]  It really is.
[43:01.420 --> 43:07.460]  And it's honestly, I would say that's one, it's not a launch, it's sort of an anti-launch.
[43:07.460 --> 43:13.160]  In terms of big stories of the year, I would say the way that Google has been revealed
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.220]  as having been caught flat-footed on this AI stuff is the big story of the year.
[43:19.220 --> 43:24.980]  Because maybe not a year ago, I mean, I think OpenAI, we had inklings that they were sort
[43:24.980 --> 43:28.260]  of creeping towards some kind of public launch.
[43:28.260 --> 43:32.940]  But certainly even two years ago, you would have thought if you found out 2023 was the
[43:32.940 --> 43:39.720]  launch of the year of AI chat hitting the mainstream, you would have, I would have thought
[43:39.720 --> 43:42.660]  Google is going to be the one who leads the way.
[43:42.660 --> 43:48.180]  And they should, but that's a thing where they should be best of breed and they're not.
[43:48.180 --> 43:52.420]  And so I think that's the big story is, hey, what's wrong inside Google that they're not
[43:52.420 --> 43:58.420]  ahead of OpenAI, or at least on level with them.
[43:58.420 --> 44:00.220]  That's absolutely, I think that's, you're right.
[44:00.220 --> 44:03.780]  I mean, when you think about Google's story this year, but they don't, they certainly
[44:03.780 --> 44:09.540]  don't have a big product that we're all talking and clamoring to try and Bard wasn't it.
[44:09.540 --> 44:16.800]  At a personal level, this thing with Musk and Zuckerberg is so, it's as close as me
[44:16.800 --> 44:19.260]  and you get to being gossip writers, right?
[44:19.260 --> 44:21.100]  I mean, it's obviously personal.
[44:21.100 --> 44:22.220]  There's a certain spite to it.
[44:22.220 --> 44:23.980]  I mean, they're actually, it's no joke.
[44:23.980 --> 44:28.300]  I know it sounds, I tried to convince my wife of it and she was like, this is not real.
[44:28.300 --> 44:33.500]  I said, I'm telling you that they're talking about actually fighting in a ring.
[44:33.500 --> 44:35.980]  This is something that might happen.
[44:35.980 --> 44:38.700]  She's just like, don't even, don't even tell me about this.
[44:38.700 --> 44:41.460]  But there's obviously some spite here, right?
[44:41.460 --> 44:43.940]  This whole platform threads.
[44:43.940 --> 44:48.940]  I don't know that it, you know, there's no way, I don't know that it exists if Musk hadn't
[44:48.940 --> 44:49.940]  bought Twitter.
[44:49.940 --> 44:54.100]  I'm not saying it's entirely spite, but I think the opportunity that Zuckerberg was
[44:54.100 --> 44:55.980]  like, yeah, we do have an opportunity here.
[44:55.980 --> 45:03.860]  We could own this space and financially, the new CEO at Twitter who've quote unquote CEO,
[45:03.860 --> 45:06.560]  because she's clearly not in charge of the company.
[45:06.560 --> 45:07.560]  She doesn't own it.
[45:07.560 --> 45:13.260]  Musk does, but Linda Yaccarino comes from NBC universal, an advertising background.
[45:13.260 --> 45:16.980]  When you think NBC universal, what type of brands are you talking about?
[45:16.980 --> 45:18.900]  You're talking the big brands.
[45:18.900 --> 45:21.180]  Those are the brands that have left Twitter.
[45:21.180 --> 45:26.420]  That's that's where if there's any chance that they're going to get back to profitability,
[45:26.420 --> 45:30.060]  it would be through advertising with those brands and those brands have all moved to
[45:30.060 --> 45:31.060]  threads.
[45:31.060 --> 45:36.220]  Yeah, I, well, first of all, there's no way threads exists without Musk buying Twitter.
[45:36.220 --> 45:43.140]  I mean, if we could say that best Musk's best social media product is now threads.
[45:43.140 --> 45:45.740]  I think that's a fair quote.
[45:45.740 --> 45:50.340]  It's his ultimately, his actions led to its existence, right?
[45:50.340 --> 45:53.460]  He's done beautiful product design on this.
[45:53.460 --> 45:58.660]  And around the fight, I mean, yeah, you might recall a few years ago, I did this video where
[45:58.660 --> 46:04.800]  it was Tim Cook action figure fighting Mark Zuckerberg action figure, and I had these
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.180]  action figures made because, okay, yeah, it's funny.
[46:08.180 --> 46:09.180]  Let's see them fight in the ring.
[46:09.180 --> 46:11.380]  But like, this is obviously a metaphorical fight.
[46:11.380 --> 46:14.160]  They're not really going to get in the ring together.
[46:14.160 --> 46:17.300]  But we had these Rock'em Sock'em robot heads made.
[46:17.300 --> 46:20.660]  And it was fun video and it did really well.
[46:20.660 --> 46:25.160]  And okay, we did that video and then this fight thing happens and I had happened to
[46:25.160 --> 46:30.840]  have gotten the Musk action figure made a few months ago when I thought that Musk was
[46:30.840 --> 46:35.980]  going to fight Tim Cook metaphorically, right, because there was the whole app store issue
[46:35.980 --> 46:37.660]  at 30%.
[46:37.660 --> 46:40.820]  And I just had had the Elon Musk one sitting on the shelf.
[46:40.820 --> 46:45.540]  And then this news comes out about like, they're really going to fight and I'm like, but they're
[46:45.540 --> 46:49.060]  really going to fight and we're really going to do the action figures is even as funny
[46:49.060 --> 46:53.140]  now like it's not as funny because they're really going to fight like this isn't a metaphor
[46:53.140 --> 46:54.140]  anymore.
[46:54.140 --> 46:55.140]  They were there.
[46:55.140 --> 46:58.700]  There's the figurative fight and then there's actually going to be a physical fight.
[46:58.700 --> 47:04.500]  So yes, we did the video of the Zuck and Elon Musk action figures fighting and it did not
[47:04.500 --> 47:08.060]  hit as well because I think people were like, we want to see the real thing.
[47:08.060 --> 47:10.660]  It's we don't want to see toys.
[47:10.660 --> 47:12.060]  It's like the state of the world.
[47:12.060 --> 47:16.180]  It's getting harder and harder to do parody comedy.
[47:16.180 --> 47:18.240]  For example, it reminds me of Trump, right?
[47:18.240 --> 47:25.980]  So imagine, like, how does something like The Onion top the time that Trump had, I think
[47:25.980 --> 47:29.300]  it was like a college football team that won the championship.
[47:29.300 --> 47:35.020]  And he bought, I don't know, $20,000 worth of McDonald's hamburgers to serve to the team.
[47:35.020 --> 47:38.780]  And there's pictures of Trump in like some fancy room in the White House surrounded by
[47:38.780 --> 47:43.140]  700 McDonald's hamburgers and french fries.
[47:43.140 --> 47:46.660]  That you would think that's something The Onion photoshopped, but it's not.
[47:46.660 --> 47:47.660]  It was real.
[47:47.660 --> 47:48.660]  So how do you top that?
[47:48.660 --> 47:49.660]  Right?
[47:49.660 --> 47:54.220]  How do you top Zuckerberg and and Musk possibly getting into a mixed martial art ring?
[47:54.220 --> 47:55.600]  I mean, you can't.
[47:55.600 --> 47:59.140]  And then we have this week with the dick measuring contest.
[47:59.140 --> 48:00.140]  Yes.
[48:00.140 --> 48:01.140]  Just say it on here.
[48:01.140 --> 48:02.140]  Right.
[48:02.140 --> 48:03.140]  Right.
[48:03.140 --> 48:04.140]  That's that's what Musk has proposed.
[48:04.140 --> 48:07.060]  So I mean, yeah, here we are.
[48:07.060 --> 48:14.480]  I, I have to say, and again, I would say probably the most oft repeated reaction of the entire
[48:14.480 --> 48:20.900]  week since thread launched is I cannot believe Elon Musk made me look root for Mark Zuckerberg,
[48:20.900 --> 48:23.340]  but that's where we are.
[48:23.340 --> 48:24.340]  And that's where we are.
[48:24.340 --> 48:25.660]  It's the lesser of two evils, right?
[48:25.660 --> 48:27.060]  I mean, it's where we are.
[48:27.060 --> 48:33.500]  And again, I, I do think one thing that's really interesting about Zuckerberg and Facebook
[48:33.500 --> 48:38.820]  overall is they don't repeat the same mistakes twice.
[48:38.820 --> 48:43.320]  Like there's no that they still have that.
[48:43.320 --> 48:47.640]  And I think it often comes from still having the founder running the company.
[48:47.640 --> 48:53.520]  There's a certain hunger and a certain let's keep moving forward.
[48:53.520 --> 48:59.300]  And I really do think, I don't think it's temporary that the overall vibe on threads
[48:59.300 --> 49:04.500]  for a typical user who signs up is like I said, like, like the Oprah show or the Ellen
[49:04.500 --> 49:12.500]  DeGeneres show, sort of daytime TV anodyne in terms of, is this controversial?
[49:12.500 --> 49:13.940]  Is this, is this political?
[49:13.940 --> 49:16.060]  Is this a thing that's on the left or the right?
[49:16.060 --> 49:18.140]  Is it going to make people angry?
[49:18.140 --> 49:24.060]  No, it's, it's mostly, if you're not looking for something political or something like
[49:24.060 --> 49:28.820]  that, you're going to get the equivalent of like, I don't know, game shows and celebrity
[49:28.820 --> 49:29.820]  news.
[49:29.820 --> 49:30.820]  That's what people like.
[49:30.820 --> 49:31.820]  Yeah.
[49:31.820 --> 49:32.820]  I'll push back on you there.
[49:32.820 --> 49:35.860]  I think we'll be here in six months having a very different conversation.
[49:35.860 --> 49:39.700]  Once they, I mean, this is the early days, they've only got an algorithmic feed.
[49:39.700 --> 49:43.580]  Once they get a following feed in there, once you start following your favorite politicians
[49:43.580 --> 49:47.860]  and you start filter bubbling, this is going to have a lot of the same problems.
[49:47.860 --> 49:52.580]  I mean, and, and we haven't talked about the fact that they have said that this is going
[49:52.580 --> 49:59.280]  to support activity pub and that means there are another set of issues, possibly really
[49:59.280 --> 50:00.340]  good things to happen.
[50:00.340 --> 50:02.140]  I think it's a great thing that they're doing it.
[50:02.140 --> 50:05.980]  On the other hand, there is the fact that there could be some tough stuff that could
[50:05.980 --> 50:07.940]  come through here that isn't moderated.
[50:07.940 --> 50:10.540]  So how they're going to deal with that as well.
[50:10.540 --> 50:11.540]  I'm with you right now.
[50:11.540 --> 50:15.420]  I think right now out of the gate, there might be some things they can do, but I think we're
[50:15.420 --> 50:17.260]  going to have some of the same, I don't think.
[50:17.260 --> 50:19.700]  We are going to have the same issues we have had.
[50:19.700 --> 50:22.220]  Well, I think that stuff will be there.
[50:22.220 --> 50:25.900]  And it's like you said about already getting a couple of haters chirping at you on the
[50:25.900 --> 50:26.900]  platform.
[50:26.900 --> 50:31.160]  Nobody with 10,000 followers like me and you who put our opinions out there aren't going
[50:31.160 --> 50:32.160]  to have some of it.
[50:32.160 --> 50:36.240]  So we have to have some sort of thick skin that a lot of people don't have to some degree.
[50:36.240 --> 50:41.980]  But I think the thing that threads, I do believe, I mean, again, would I bet my house on it?
[50:41.980 --> 50:43.220]  No, maybe I'd bet my old.
[50:43.220 --> 50:44.220]  What about your Accura?
[50:44.220 --> 50:45.980]  Yeah, I'd bet my Accura on it.
[50:45.980 --> 50:47.460]  No question about it that.
[50:47.460 --> 50:48.460]  All right, let's bet it.
[50:48.460 --> 50:49.460]  Let's bet.
[50:49.460 --> 50:50.460]  You know what?
[50:50.460 --> 50:51.460]  We'll bet your tape dongle.
[50:51.460 --> 50:52.460]  Yeah, my tape dongle.
[50:52.460 --> 50:56.740]  I'll bet my tape dongle that while that stuff will be there, I don't think they're ever
[50:56.740 --> 51:01.780]  going to promote it algorithmically to do engagement, which is where Twitter really
[51:01.780 --> 51:07.060]  went wrong, where Twitter really, I mean, Twitter has gone wrong in so many other ways.
[51:07.060 --> 51:12.860]  But one of the things I remember from all the way back in 2016 even, so this is way
[51:12.860 --> 51:17.220]  pre-Musk, but like when Hillary Clinton was running for president and she would tweet
[51:17.220 --> 51:19.400]  something and I'd look at her tweet.
[51:19.400 --> 51:24.940]  The top replies to her tweets were always from garbage people, like hot takes.
[51:24.940 --> 51:29.020]  And it was like, and I could see what the algorithm was optimizing for.
[51:29.020 --> 51:33.980]  It was optimizing for me to be angry at these people replying to Hillary Clinton.
[51:33.980 --> 51:39.460]  The top, and they were randos, total randos, not like famous people from Fox News or something
[51:39.460 --> 51:40.460]  like that.
[51:40.460 --> 51:45.100]  But people with fake names and numbers at the end of their username and an avatar that's
[51:45.100 --> 51:47.400]  a cartoon character or something.
[51:47.400 --> 51:53.340]  And you could just see, I don't think Threads is ever going to promote those sort of replies
[51:53.340 --> 51:57.660]  to the top of the replies you see just for engagement.
[51:57.660 --> 51:59.920]  They'll be there if you're looking for them.
[51:59.920 --> 52:02.940]  And there's already people that everybody can object to on Threads.
[52:02.940 --> 52:06.660]  I mean, with 100 million users, of course there's people who everybody is going to think
[52:06.660 --> 52:07.660]  is a jerk.
[52:07.660 --> 52:10.860]  No matter which side of any issue you are.
[52:10.860 --> 52:15.140]  But I just don't think they're going to index on that in terms of what they promote.
[52:15.140 --> 52:20.120]  Because the other thing, the difference is that Twitter is all Twitter has and they have
[52:20.120 --> 52:24.020]  to, at all costs, try to make money on it.
[52:24.020 --> 52:26.440]  Facebook doesn't need Threads at all.
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.300]  This is like a total side project for them.
[52:29.300 --> 52:33.180]  And I'm not saying they're not eventually, of course they're going to turn ads on.
[52:33.180 --> 52:38.540]  But Zuckerberg says only once they get to a billion users, which again, how bold is
[52:38.540 --> 52:39.540]  that?
[52:39.540 --> 52:44.500]  His idea is every time we build a platform, we wait till we can see if we can build it
[52:44.500 --> 52:48.020]  to a billion users, then try to figure out how to monetize it.
[52:48.020 --> 52:50.580]  Well, there's only 8 billion people on the planet.
[52:50.580 --> 52:55.340]  So they wait until they get one out of every eight living people using their platforms
[52:55.340 --> 52:57.920]  before they look to monetize it.
[52:57.920 --> 53:00.980]  The ambition is insane.
[53:00.980 --> 53:06.860]  I had to keep updating the end of the column because the kicker in my column was, there's
[53:06.860 --> 53:09.700]  a famous quote, 70 million signups isn't cool.
[53:09.700 --> 53:10.700]  You know what's cool?
[53:10.700 --> 53:13.460]  A billion signups.
[53:13.460 --> 53:20.260]  But I had to keep updating that quote because the signups keep upping and upping and upping.
[53:20.260 --> 53:24.260]  And I even had it in the first draft of the column, which went up a few hours after the
[53:24.260 --> 53:27.660]  launch, I said, this isn't going to likely happen this week, but it's probably what he's
[53:27.660 --> 53:29.240]  aiming for.
[53:29.240 --> 53:34.960]  And then a couple days later, he does confirm, yes, I want a billion people here.
[53:34.960 --> 53:39.500]  And this is another full-on platform play for us.
[53:39.500 --> 53:42.080]  I will just add before we move on from this.
[53:42.080 --> 53:47.560]  The other thing I will add is that Zuck is funny when he wants to be.
[53:47.560 --> 53:51.640]  Some of his little zingers have been very, very funny.
[53:51.640 --> 53:57.920]  One of the things he did, he has, I forget his username, it's crazy, some nickname he
[53:57.920 --> 54:02.120]  must have had back then, yeah, Finkt or Find or something like that.
[54:02.120 --> 54:05.780]  But he hadn't posted to his Twitter account in 11 years.
[54:05.780 --> 54:12.340]  And when Threads launched, he posted one tweet and it was that Spider-Man cartoon meme of
[54:12.340 --> 54:18.060]  one Spider-Man pointing at another, like everybody has seen the meme.
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.940]  What a funny thing to tweet.
[54:19.940 --> 54:25.820]  And then there was a couple other, like there's a, it's almost like 40,000 retweets.
[54:25.820 --> 54:26.820]  Unbelievable.
[54:26.820 --> 54:29.720]  There's also a sort of, it's almost a meme.
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.660]  It's a thing Musk does on Twitter where somebody will post something about like a Hunter Biden
[54:34.660 --> 54:40.160]  conspiracy theory and Musk will just write concerning.
[54:40.160 --> 54:47.700]  So there was somebody pointed out that about 24 hours after Threads launched, Threads was
[54:47.700 --> 54:54.080]  no longer a trending topic on Twitter, which obviously it would have been if there wasn't
[54:54.080 --> 54:55.760]  a thumb on the scale, right?
[54:55.760 --> 54:59.820]  I mean, cause you could just look at Twitter and everybody was writing about Threads on
[54:59.820 --> 55:02.460]  Twitter, but yet it's not trending.
[55:02.460 --> 55:05.000]  There's no pound Threads hashtag.
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.000]  And somebody pointed out that it wasn't on the list of trending topics and Zuck replied
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  concerning.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.680]  I had to laugh.
[55:13.680 --> 55:15.900]  It's super funny.
[55:15.900 --> 55:19.940]  And I'm like, I thought, I thought Threads was trending on Twitter still.
[55:19.940 --> 55:23.600]  Yeah, they probably like dropped it or something.
[55:23.600 --> 55:24.600]  Yeah.
[55:24.600 --> 55:25.600]  Yeah.
[55:25.600 --> 55:30.680]  But anyway, I do think Twitter's in big trouble because obviously Musk can keep writing checks
[55:30.680 --> 55:36.520]  and keep selling Tesla and SpaceX stock to keep it afloat if he wants to keep throwing
[55:36.520 --> 55:38.820]  good money after bad.
[55:38.820 --> 55:46.680]  But I think that their opportunity to return as the microblogging safe home for major brands
[55:46.680 --> 55:52.360]  and advertisers, I think it's gone because I think Threads is going to occupy that space.
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.180]  The one thing Twitter had that'll never come back was it was the one, for a long time,
[55:57.180 --> 56:01.240]  it was the only place that was like Twitter and everybody was there.
[56:01.240 --> 56:02.700]  And it was easier then, right?
[56:02.700 --> 56:08.000]  If you wanted to do something like Twitter, you use Twitter and that was it.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.420]  I think there's just that idea that Musk who wanted to grow this, who wanted to grow this
[56:13.420 --> 56:18.900]  platform and not only grow it, but turn it into a subscription platform, a place where
[56:18.900 --> 56:26.120]  you would pay to engage there, to buy more services because you loved the community and
[56:26.120 --> 56:32.040]  it was a pillar of free speech and all of the things he's said he's wanted to do.
[56:32.040 --> 56:40.040]  Growing that seems so very hard now with Threads up his butt or whatever word he would insert
[56:40.040 --> 56:41.040]  there.
[56:41.040 --> 56:45.680]  And I mean, I will say I have been paying for Twitter Blue and I will tell you why I
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.680]  pay for Twitter Blue and everyone will call me a hater and people fire it off at me because
[56:50.680 --> 56:54.880]  I have the blue check mark still, but this was one of my main ways of engaging with my
[56:54.880 --> 57:01.340]  audience and being able to edit tweets and being able to have some more of the capabilities
[57:01.340 --> 57:05.680]  that is underd offered Twitter Boo was a good incentive, it was fine for me, okay?
[57:05.680 --> 57:10.760]  To pay what, $8 a month, I don't pay through the app store, I go directly through them.
[57:10.760 --> 57:12.560]  Okay, fine.
[57:12.560 --> 57:14.440]  Now do I need to pay that?
[57:14.440 --> 57:19.200]  If my audience is building on Threads and I'm gonna try to split my time and maybe eventually
[57:19.200 --> 57:22.840]  go more over to Threads?
[57:22.840 --> 57:27.440]  So look, think about users and growth, fine, I don't think he's growing users, I just don't
[57:27.440 --> 57:28.660]  think that's happening.
[57:28.660 --> 57:32.840]  But what he's really been trying to do is keep that subscription business, build it,
[57:32.840 --> 57:33.840]  build it, build it.
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.920]  I think that's what's really in jeopardy.
[57:35.920 --> 57:36.920]  Yep.
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.200]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good
[57:41.200 --> 57:48.080]  friends Man Fuel, coursing through my veins at this moment is their product Trade Coffee.
[57:48.080 --> 57:53.880]  Trade Coffee, I love this company, it's a coffee subscription service that makes it
[57:53.880 --> 57:56.400]  so simple to discover new coffees.
[57:56.400 --> 58:04.160]  They have over 450 varieties of coffee from over 55 top independent roasters in America.
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.400]  You sign up for Trade, you tell them what type of coffee you like, or if you don't know,
[58:08.400 --> 58:12.560]  if you're new to being sort of a coffee nerd who knows what type of coffee you like, you
[58:12.560 --> 58:15.520]  can just let them start sending you suggestions.
[58:15.520 --> 58:21.200]  You get it, you brew it, you get an email from them, how'd you like the last batch of
[58:21.200 --> 58:25.140]  coffee, give it a thumbs up, thumbs down, and they use that to dial in which type of
[58:25.140 --> 58:26.880]  varieties you like.
[58:26.880 --> 58:32.200]  And you can set how often you want to get it, every two weeks, a bag a week, maybe you've
[58:32.200 --> 58:37.240]  got a whole household full of coffee junkies and you want to get two bags a week, whatever
[58:37.240 --> 58:38.660]  you want you can get.
[58:38.660 --> 58:43.060]  You want to go on vacation, it's summertime, it's so super easy to go to their site and
[58:43.060 --> 58:48.160]  say skip one of the deliveries or pause it until I come back if you want to.
[58:48.160 --> 58:53.920]  You're in complete control over the deliveries, but the bottom line is you get fresh roasted
[58:53.920 --> 59:00.040]  coffee from great roasters delivered to you on a regular basis and they stamp the date
[59:00.040 --> 59:01.640]  on when the coffee was roasted.
[59:01.640 --> 59:06.480]  It usually gets to my door within like three days, four days max of when the coffee was
[59:06.480 --> 59:07.520]  actually roasted.
[59:07.520 --> 59:11.160]  You never get coffee that fresh at a supermarket, ever.
[59:11.160 --> 59:14.840]  It is the number one tip I have for making coffee.
[59:14.840 --> 59:18.480]  It's not about buying thousand dollar or more coffee makers.
[59:18.480 --> 59:25.520]  I just boil water, grind it, and just do a simple pour over in a $2 coffee cone that
[59:25.520 --> 59:27.120]  I put paper filters in.
[59:27.120 --> 59:31.480]  My coffee rig costs like $4.
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.360]  All that really matters to make great coffee is fresh beans, fresh good beans.
[59:36.360 --> 59:38.240]  And that's what trade delivers to you.
[59:38.240 --> 59:44.880]  It is absolutely a great service with great coffee and having it to show up on the schedule
[59:44.880 --> 59:48.560]  that you consume, it couldn't be easier.
[59:48.560 --> 59:50.280]  So where do you go to find out more?
[59:50.280 --> 59:53.520]  Upgrade your morning routine with better coffee right now.
[59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.720]  Trade is offering our listeners a free bag of coffee with any subscription at www.drinktrade.com
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:08.680]  slash the talk show, that's www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show for a free bag of coffee
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.840]  with any subscription purchase www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.240]  Does Trade Coffee do cold brew?
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.240]  No, they only deliver beans, so you would have to somehow figure out how to do your
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.240]  own cold brew at home, which you can do, but I've never done.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.080]  They just send you the beans, so you could definitely do cold brew with it.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]  I don't make cold brew at home.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.400]  I haven't heard of it, so I'm up for this.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:44.280]  My friend Marco Arment, I've been to his house, he makes his own cold brew, which of
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.660]  course is delicious, but it's also incredibly potent.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.660]  That's what I need.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.100]  You can make any coffee you want with Trade Coffee.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.400]  Actually they do, they have cold brew bags.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.440]  Ah, see, I didn't know that.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]  I didn't know that.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]  There you go.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]  See?
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.440]  Everything you need.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.440]  Oh, they have a cold brew box.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.440]  Okay.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.440]  I'm getting this.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440]  I'm getting it.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440]  All right.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440]  Yeah.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440]  See?
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]  There we go.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]  That's why they're a repeat sponsor.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.280]  I thought of a bonus question on Threads.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.520]  How crazy is it that their app doesn't support the iPad?
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.720]  I mean, you can run it, but it's the iPhone size window on iPad, which is the same.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.200]  I know it's like, well, shocker, it's Instagram.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.440]  Instagram's 13 years old and still doesn't have an iPad app.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.620]  And we had a back and forth on this on Thread.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:39.080]  So I would say, I hear your argument, which is that if they do web first, then they'll
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:44.100]  never do the iPad because people will just say, well, run the web app on your iPad.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.360]  Every iPad has a browser.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.760]  Everyone will say that.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:54.560]  I argue the number one thing they need to do is Mac.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.520]  A Mac app or just a good web app that you can just run in a browser on your Mac?
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.760]  Well, I've worried for the same reasons you do about the iPad app.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.460]  If they just do the web app, they'll be like, well, you can just run a, I heard every Mac
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.080]  can run a browser.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.240]  Well, I think that's what they're going to do.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.640]  I would love it if they had a Mac app.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.880]  The fact that Instagram is-
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.440]  I would even take the iOS app on Mac.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.760]  I mean, it's very, and I threaded about this this morning and people said, why don't they
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:25.520]  just enable the one step in the submission to the app?
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]  Run on Mac.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.000]  You can run on any Apple Silicon.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Let's do it.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  I would be fine with it.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.240]  I would be totally fine with that for right now.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:41.240]  And for many types of apps, just running the iPhone app as is on the Mac is not what you
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  really want.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.000]  Like if it's a photo editing app or something where you actually do stuff.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.160]  But if you're just scrolling a list and you just want to type with a real keyboard, it
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.920]  actually would be fine, right?
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:57.120]  Like my window, like when I use ivory for Mastodon is just a long, tall, skinny window.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.800]  It's sort of like a phone on my Mac that I just scroll and reply.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.800]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.640]  And look, Facebook really, I don't think, I think they might've done a Windows app at
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.800]  some point.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  Yeah.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  Maybe a long time ago.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.960]  But they never really were into desktop apps for Windows and certainly not for Instagram.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.680]  So I think the best we get here is a web app.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.680]  Yeah.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.680]  That's my guess.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.580]  I think the only reason that there isn't a web app that you can use, like I said earlier,
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:33.240]  you can go to threads.net and see threads, but you can't log in and actually post or
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.520]  reply to them.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.840]  I just think it's because they rushed it out to capitalize on Twitter's recent downtime.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840]  Yeah.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:45.600]  And they had told us actually in the briefing that we did with, that I did with a few other
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.880]  reporters at the journal, sorry, his name is Connor Hayes.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.340]  He's the VP of product at Meta.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.280]  He said they had a web app.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:00.380]  So it's clear they have a web app that's coming and right now it's just very limited to users
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.380]  or whatever.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.380]  I'm looking at yours right now.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.380]  Right?
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:06.760]  Just I go to threads.net slash at grouper.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.000]  I even had the thought, I remember thinking, cause Zuck was very, very active in the first
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  48 hours.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.280]  But he must have a web app that he's using.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.460]  Cause I think it would be hard to be as productive in as many threads as he was without doing
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:27.240]  it with your hands on a real keyboard and operating at the faster speed you can go at
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.640]  with a full computer in front of you.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.960]  But anyway, exciting times.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.800]  I thought the next topic we can go back a month and sort of look at the vision pro vision
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.120]  OS announcement from WWDC.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.680]  Where are you thinking about this one month after it was announced?
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.280]  I want to try it again.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.760]  It's like that 30 minutes, you had your 30 minutes and it stuck with me.
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.880]  I don't know what yours was like, but I sort of ended up butting up a little bit against
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.480]  the demoers in the room because I kept wanting to sort of go off and do my own thing.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.240]  And they're trying to steer you back on, on the road.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.900]  And I'm like, well, no, I want to go over here, you know, and they're like, no, no,
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.200]  we only have limited time and we need to do these things.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.880]  And on top of that, I was trying to keep notes because I knew that I had to file my column
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.880]  really quickly.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.020]  And I will forget, I will forget what I'm thinking.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.240]  So I wanted to keep taking some notes, which actually was really good testing because I
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.880]  was able to see the notebook, right, like it was compared to any meta quest I've used
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.960]  or meta quest pro, you're sort of fighting the headset to find your notebook and look
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960]  down.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.640]  And so that was actually quite a good test.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.000]  They were not quite happy that I kept trying to write notes, but it worked well.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.480]  So my biggest thing is I want to use it again.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.920]  It's been a month, right, or a little bit more.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.720]  Yeah, a little bit more.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.840]  I want to try it again, out again.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.520]  Yeah, because there's some stuff that has, it's not that I've forgotten it, but that
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:59.760]  it's, it almost has faded into, it was more like I watched a video even though I was really
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.760]  using it.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:06.360]  My friend Ben Thompson from Dithering, during his trial of it, he somehow got the keyboard
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.640]  to pop up.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.600]  Like one of the things, you know, there was a definite happy path that we were guided
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.320]  to and we were not meant to ever have the keyboard appear.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320]  And it did for Ben.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320]  I forget what he did.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.720]  I think he like, I think he looked at the location bar in Safari and pinched his fingers
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:31.560]  and so then like you're editing the search term or the URL and the keyboard came up and
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.560]  they, because they could see what we were seeing and they're like, oh, you weren't supposed
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560]  to see that.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.560]  And tried to back out.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.760]  It was a little sharing that they got to see the keyboard interaction.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.080]  I didn't see it either, but yeah, I think some stuff like that, I'd like to try the
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.640]  FaceTime experience again.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:53.640]  I feel like I might be blurring what I saw in the presentation and what I saw in real
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.800]  life with the woman who was talking to me, though I had a lot of fun with that.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.760]  I sort of kept, cause I was, I really wanted to make sure it wasn't a canned demo.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760]  Yes.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.360]  Cause it kind of looked like, it kind of looked like a canned demo.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.360]  Yeah.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.160]  I was asking her to do really weird things.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.360]  Like I was like, stick out your tongue and like it, I was like, pick your nose, things
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360]  like that.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360]  Like she's like, excuse me.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.160]  And I was like, I'm just trying, I'm just being a journalist here.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.600]  Got to make sure this is real.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]  It was fun.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.160]  And it was, and it, and it did work quite well.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:28.440]  And of course like we didn't get to try scanning our faces and making our own, what do we call
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440]  it?
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440]  What are they called FaceTime?
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:31.440]  Personas.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.440]  Personas.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440]  Personas.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440]  Personas.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440]  Personas.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.320]  I don't know why I'm avatar, but I'm sure that's not what it's called.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.360]  No, they're calling them personas and I don't know why.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.520]  I guess avatar implies static.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.520]  Also implies meta.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.520]  Oh yeah.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]  Maybe.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520]  I would like to do that again too.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.960]  And I know a lot of people have been speculating about, you know, are people going to be creeped
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.240]  out by this or not?
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.360]  And I don't know.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.000]  It wasn't creepy, but it was weird.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.680]  It threw me off because before they announced it, I know people were thinking maybe, you
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.920]  know, when you have the headset on, you'll appear to others as your Memoji, which I didn't
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.760]  think they would do because that seems too weird.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:18.760]  As much as some people might, that might be a mode you would toggle as a gag, but it doesn't
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.960]  work in either.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.600]  To me, the two main contexts for those things are talking to your family and talking for
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.640]  work.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.920]  And you certainly aren't going to appear as your Memoji in a professional context.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.400]  I mean, I guess you and I would for the show, right?
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:38.040]  Like, yeah, I could definitely be my Memoji talking to Joanna for the podcast.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]  But why?
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]  Right.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]  But like why?
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]  Yeah.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.560]  But you're not going to do a story and in the course of researching the story, if you
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:50.980]  have a FaceTime call with a source, you're not going to be a Memoji, a cartoon character.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.660]  And when you're apart from your family and you want to talk to your kids or you're talking
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:02.240]  to your parents or your spouse or whoever, the whole reason you're doing a FaceTime call
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.080]  is they want to see your face.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.480]  It defeats the purpose to be a Memoji or something like that.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480]  Yeah.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:19.360]  And I think I shared this maybe a day or two after another really compelling use of this
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.400]  does really seem to be the photos.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:28.640]  And one of the demos that stuck with me was the image of the family, right, having the
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.400]  birthday party, the 3D, what do they call it?
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.040]  It's sort of like a volumetric 3D capture of this family.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.840]  And that also stuck with me because that is far more lifelike and real because it's the
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.440]  real image of what had happened, right, and the idea is that we'll take it with the headset.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.960]  And I think I shared on this as I was traveling for work and missing my family.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:59.200]  I could really see the benefit of looking at these 3D lifelike, they're sort of like
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.200]  live images.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.820]  Yeah, well, they're like memories.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.080]  They really are.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.480]  It's and it was uncanny.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.820]  They had a couple examples for us.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.600]  And the one was I forget which order they appeared in.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.440]  But the one was Alicia Keys, I think in a in a music recording studio.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.960]  And it's like you're getting to observe one of the biggest, most popular singers in pop
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.360]  music today recording a song.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.040]  And it wasn't like watching a video was like you were there and you could see her and she
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.920]  seemed like she was pretty close to just a couple feet in front of you.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:45.140]  But because it was a professional recording studio, and it's it's a pop star, it kind
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.660]  of still felt it was amazing in 3D.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.800]  But it kind of felt like I was on a ride at Disney World, like here I am looking at Alicia
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  Keys.
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.640]  But when they showed us the one with the kids and the birthday cake, and the kids, brother
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.240]  and sister, it that the weird part about it was it honestly felt like I was intrusive.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.760]  You know, it was like it wasn't like I was watching somebody's family, family video.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.640]  It was like I was in their house for the family birthday party.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.940]  And it's like, I don't know these kids.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.560]  So why am I here?
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.520]  You know, but imagine it was your family.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520]  Oh, right.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.120]  And that's where like, I was trying, I think, I think I shared this, like, maybe from the
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120]  hotel room.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.880]  And I was like, I couldn't stop thinking about that experience and that I really could see
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.320]  Apple investing whether it's the next iPhone or iPads as ability to take those photos,
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]  right?
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.120]  Because I think, look, the memes around the dad taking the photo of the family were hilarious
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.880]  and very, very black mirror, right?
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.760]  You got this guy wearing this headset, why isn't he playing with his kids in real time?
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:58.040]  But if your iPhone takes those, or your iPad takes those using LIDAR and a combination
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:04.480]  of camera lenses and all the other kind of AI stuff they have going on there, I'm in.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.600]  Yeah, yeah, I would say one of the huge game changing factor would be if the if and presumably
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.740]  if they can do it, they would they'd be crazy not to.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:20.200]  But if future iPhones have the ability to shoot these volumetric videos, whatever, I
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.840]  forget their their term for them.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.460]  But yeah, I forget what this but if you could shoot these 3d things with your phone, or
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:33.460]  even an iPad, but something that's not so odd as putting a headset on.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:40.520]  But even with just the headset, I still think in the in the early years, it'll be it still
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.760]  would be something I wish and I talked to a couple other people at Apple who've been
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:50.400]  using it who are sort of my age and my situation where they've got kids, but the kids are already
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.580]  college age or older.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.240]  And they're like, man, and and people who were working on the feature, and they said,
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.960]  once we got it working, I was like, Oh, my God, I can't believe I don't have this for
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.960]  my kids.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.360]  My kids are too old, you know, and, and the people who are a little younger, like in your
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.520]  situation where you've got like six year olds and two year olds still running around the
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]  house.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.200]  They're like, once we had this working, I can't wait to be able to take this home and
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.560]  start shooting some of these.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.960]  And I think I know everybody is it's not a unique observation 1000 people have made the
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:28.740]  observation that like back in the 80s when VHS camcorders became consumer priced, and
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:34.000]  they were the size of a boombox they had to whichever parent was using it often the dad,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.040]  but it was shoulder mounted.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040]  They were that big.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:45.720]  But, but the families who had them have memories of kids on blowing out birthday cakes that
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.440]  are way better than the my family never had a video camera.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.480]  My my parents were not I don't know where my gadget hound it genes come from.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.320]  But we did not have we relate to much technology.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.400]  We had an Atari but we didn't have a camcorder.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.180]  But I think that even that I but you as a kid of the 80s I certainly remember other
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:12.160]  kids parents having them and the way it would work is the dad would get it out for the for
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.680]  the birthday cake part shoot 10 minutes of video and then put it away.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.120]  So so you know, my dad had one Yeah, so put the headset on and be the weird parent who's
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.360]  going to wear a headset on a birthday party for 10 minutes.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.080]  And there's something you're going to need to for long.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080]  But yeah, I agree.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.200]  I mean, I agree put it on for a few minutes capture that that one scene take it off.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.880]  I just I think it think it's pretty clear it's just going to it's going to be a format
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.520]  and Apple loves their own their own photo formats and video formats and we'll get one
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:49.000]  of them and I think it for me, that was one of the places we talked about it earlier,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.480]  like the the the watching on the airplane.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.400]  Okay, I could see myself doing that, especially on some long flights.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:03.840]  And the memory thing and certainly for me the work applications really seem like I do
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.560]  want more monitors and I do like the ability to put things all over my desk and I'm editing
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.680]  looking at a video and I'm working on a car I mean like it did open my eyes and I think
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:21.200]  the whole the whole spatial computing pitch it is it is going to have to find just like
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:27.600]  any computing platform people's uses, but they did demonstrate quite at least three
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.360]  really strong applications for this.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:38.680]  What are you counting the three applications work right right entertainment yeah watching
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:45.840]  videos we saw some of the 360 videos though I wasn't that impressed with that having made
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:52.040]  360 videos for the last 10 years where you know other VR platforms but I think the compelling
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:58.040]  like really compelling to me was what was the it was the avatar trailer yeah yep right
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040]  and being able to dim but not see see some of my surroundings but really being able to
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.080]  just see that but also see like a little bit of the person sitting next to me I think is
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:10.960]  really compelling it's like what I would want to do on a flight and then I think that third
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.520]  thing being photography or memories yeah yeah those were those were three that stuck to
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.360]  me I think there are others that yeah I I think so too and I think as the rumor mill
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:29.360]  churns the the first year is it's not going to be a big deal and and the cost is almost
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:37.880]  irrelevant I agree because by all accounts that the constraint are these super super
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:44.320]  rare displays in front of each eye and everybody is saying that they're apples buying them
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:49.640]  from so Sony and they're only going to be able to make like a million of them in by
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:56.800]  20 the end of 2024 and so if it takes two good ones so there a what's the yield if there's
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.520]  some 10% of them have dead pixels will they have to throw those out that they're only
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.440]  going to be able to no matter what the demand is from consumers apples theoretical maximum
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.520]  is like four to five hundred thousand units for the first year that they can make so if
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.880]  they can only make five hundred thousand of them I think they'll sell out instantly I
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.840]  think they'll be back ordered for six months the whole year but then they'll by 2025 they'll
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.320]  be able to make them fast enough to meet demand and by 2026 if you want it you'll be able
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.800]  to go to the Apple store and buy it it'll take a price will come down and I think even
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:39.280]  when you look at where the market is right now for these VR AR mixed reality headsets
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.560]  and enterprise picking that up at a pace that sure that's not mainstream but that's a place
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.600]  that I've spoken to many people in this industry they're going to buy them they're going to
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:55.400]  buy them and not in mass but a number of them for their companies they're getting going
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.080]  I think it's going to be amazing for some types of work I think for people who want
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.960]  to spread out with multiple monitors I really I really think you'll be able to work like
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:10.480]  this and I look forward to and then you could travel with just just a keyboard and a trackpad
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.280]  for it'll obviously be better to type on a real keyboard but instead of lugging a whole
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.240]  laptop just take a Bluetooth keyboard with you I should probably write this but I went
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:23.120]  to Aspen for the Aspen ideas festival at the beginning of June and there were two things
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.480]  on that trip that made me realize and I guess I'm being repetitive now but on the plane
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.880]  there and I and I thought about this and I don't think I ever shared it but I thought
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:35.740]  about this in the presentation I said well we've had meta quests for a long time now
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.000]  number of years I never see someone on the airplane wearing a meta quest why haven't
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.160]  I but on the flight one of my flights that was very delayed and I will not get into it
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:50.600]  right now somebody from United is listening I'm very unhappy anyway but someone on my
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:58.880]  flight to Denver put on a pair of N real that's the company glasses these AR glasses and he
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.000]  was sitting next to me and go oh I was like freaking out I was like excuse me excuse me
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.880]  a tap him on the shoulder I was like what are you watching in the air it's like oh I'm
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:11.320]  just I'm watching some stuff I downloaded on YouTube and and I thought okay this is
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.080]  a thing this is gonna be a thing it's it's this nerdy guy here and I don't even remember
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.840]  his name but if you're listening you strike me as someone who might listen to your podcast
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.400]  to be honest okay if this nerdy guy is doing this now this is gonna be a thing yeah yeah
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:31.720]  it's like air pods is like okay we kind of think they look ridiculous but when you got
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.200]  him on and you're free from that yes it is so much better than watching this tiny screen
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.120]  on the back of my airplane seat it's so much better I honestly think I mean from the the
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.560]  the 30-minute demo we had in the amount of time we spent watching movies it it's going
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.080]  to go from hey this is a slightly better way to watch movies like on an airplane or a train
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.600]  to this is actually more compelling and visually better than watching on your TV at home it
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:04.600]  is like being in a movie theater like it it'll elevate movie watching on a plane to a this
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.720]  is actually the best place this is like the best way to watch a movie yeah and this was
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:15.200]  a guy road warrior clearly traveling for business just like I was so he that's one place he's
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.320]  using that device the second place then I had to work on a column and video in my hotel
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:25.200]  room and I'm setting up my Mac and my iPad screen and I'm trying to figure out my side
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.600]  car situation and I want to get the the screen to the right height because I don't want to
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.120]  look down at the iPad but I want to put the other thing up and this whole thing is like
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.440]  no I would have my headset down the line I'm not I'm not saying what year I'm gonna have
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.280]  this perfect setup but I'm gonna have my headset I'm gonna be working in my hotel room and
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.360]  you're right maybe all I've brought with me on this trip is actually just a keyboard and
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:51.080]  a mouse yep I guess I don't even bring the mouse right I'm using my hands yeah I don't
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.920]  know I think I kind of feel like I'm gonna want a mouse for like for text editing right
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:59.320]  because we're gonna be writing and I feel like I want the person I don't want to I don't
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.560]  know I don't want to prejudge that looking at yeah I don't know how accurate placing
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:09.240]  the insertion point will be with it but I I would expect if I want a keyboard I'll probably
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.080]  just want a mouse and I'll have to take it in the bag but I can really see working that
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.320]  way I do think I think they're on to something I think they know it I think it will be years
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.680]  and that's you know I agree and I think it goes the way of the Mac honestly at first
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:29.560]  yep in terms of adoption and in terms of usage yep yeah I mean and the Mac people don't it's
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:35.040]  it seems but it seems ridiculous now that it's this platform we expect to now sort of
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.240]  be a forever platform but it it sold terribly for the first couple years there was like
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:45.440]  hey that the Steve Jobs took it out of the bag and a Matt cute little Mac says I'm so
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.620]  glad to be out of that bag and everybody laughed and some people bought it right away and so
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.980]  like the first month sales were great and then like six months later nobody was buying
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:01.920]  this $2,500 computer that didn't have a lot of software yet at the end inflation adjusted
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:09.400]  that's 7,500 in today's dollars right so if you think 3,500 is a lot a 1984 Mac was 7,500
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.760]  equivalent so no wonder it didn't sell that well but but it was a great idea obviously
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.560]  and just needed a couple of years for everything to sort of prices to come down software to
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:25.760]  be available and people to sort of get it like hey this is great but imagine like like
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:31.400]  when you you've got to turn around videos so fast I remember talking to you at keynote
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:35.900]  day and you were already like I've got to go because you're working on a on a video
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:41.560]  with with the team that you work on at the journal but like imagine if you could preview
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.280]  the video with the headset so you could see it instead of seeing it on like your phone
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.800]  or whatever you have with you or even just like a 13 inch screen on a laptop if you could
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:56.760]  just see the video big it would be fantastic like video editors or people like who are
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:01.520]  shooting movies and commercials and want to do work and start editing the footage in the
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.240]  field you don't have to look at it small on a laptop you can look at it big like it's
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.020]  going to be when you're showing it on TV or showing it you know if it's actually a movie
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:16.680]  showing it on a big movie theater screen which makes things look different you can actually
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:22.800]  preview it as a movie and I mean they made this cell and I think the idea that this was
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:28.160]  come for the TV market is is not a huge I don't think that's really realistic people
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:35.280]  it's a different a sit it's a different market but I think monitors that is that is the place
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:40.900]  right I don't you know I don't want to say never because you know at the moment I can't
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:46.840]  imagine that I would rather when I go to my office to work for the day that I'd rather
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:52.520]  put a headset on I don't think so but I you know come back in five years and see what
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.120]  we're talking future I'm not talking this nothing I've really said here do I mean and
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.960]  that's where it's like sort of thinking through that trip I just had but with the lens of
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.120]  okay in the future I take this trip what are the devices I'm bringing with me it isn't
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.200]  an iPhone a Mac and a iPad yeah it really are the devices I traveled with an ear pods
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:17.560]  right it just air pods a phone your headset and a keyboard and a mouse and you'd be set
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.920]  I don't think that's crazy yeah I don't think so either all right let me take one last break
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:31.160]  here for of course our good friends sponsors and tell you about rocket money rocket money
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:36.840]  is let me just start by asking a question to you dear listener did you have you ever
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.480]  found that you had like a subscription to something maybe a streaming service that you
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:48.000]  signed up for before to watch one show or a publication a newsletter or something like
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.600]  that that you haven't even read in a year and then you look and you just notice it on
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.940]  your bill and you've got like hey why am I still paying for this I haven't used it in
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:25:00.200]  a while rocket money is a service they all sorts of personal finance stuff you can do
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:06.600]  through rocket money but the one thing they do better than anybody is help identify recurring
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.840]  payments and subscriptions that you have and present them to you in a way like hey here's
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.040]  all the stuff you're paying for every month is any of the stuff that you don't want to
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.580]  use anymore and when you find stuff you don't want to do any you want to use anymore stuff
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.580]  that you forgot you're paying for it you can cancel it right in rocket money and just do
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.460]  it right there they know how to cancel all sorts of subscription things that you've already
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:34.160]  got right there in rocket money it can pay for itself just by canceling like one or two
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.720]  subscriptions that you forgot about that you're paying when just wasting money on according
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.380]  to rocket money over eighty percent of people have subscriptions that they have forgotten
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:47.180]  about you could be wasting money and not even realizing it they will help you get those

[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:57.400]  think they spend about eighty dollars a month on subscriptions total but the actual total
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.680]  for the average American is closer to two hundred dollars a month so the odds are very
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:06.180]  very high that there's a lot of that in your monthly budget that you could easily cancel

[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:43.100]  all right last segment and this is the build one we've been waiting for is the other big
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:50.660]  story of the year is your and nicole newin's combined investigative research at the journal
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.440]  on forgot about it i didn't realize we were going to go there but great well let's let
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:05.300]  me let me let you summarize the problem in the situation okay simply tldr three of our
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:13.280]  articles or four of our articles and two videos both about 10 minutes each across the country
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:20.500]  thieves are stealing people's iphones typically this happens at night in and around bars but
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:25.540]  before they steal the phone they are watching people put in their passcodes and they are
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:32.360]  learning their passcodes sometimes they're even filming them from afar they get the passcode
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:39.100]  they steal the phone and they steal it through some pretty interesting methods it's sort
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:44.900]  of a trickery type of deal and then with the passcode they're basically able to wreak havoc
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:50.180]  on these people's financial and digital lives and one thing that we've really kind of focused
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:55.740]  on here because this is actually what prompted many of these victims to reach out to me and
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:00.700]  how i found out about this story is that when these thieves get their passcodes one of the
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:05.400]  first steps they're taking if not the first step is they use the passcode to change the
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.060]  apple id password because all you need to do to change the apple id password is the
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:16.200]  passcode and so then they are locking people out of their apple accounts so they can't
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:21.540]  use find my to get back into their phones and they're really locking people out of their
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:25.860]  phones forever or sort of their apple accounts sorry i should say they're locking people
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:30.200]  out of their apple accounts forever so when these people's phones get stolen many times
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:35.460]  they are drunk sometimes they've been drugged by these people when they when they come to
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.860]  they'll go to their computer as all of us would do when if our phones got taken or we
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:43.100]  lost it and try to go to find by but they're blocked out then they try to get back into
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:49.540]  their apple account by doing recovery account recovery they can't get back in and after
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:54.060]  many many hours and months and time on the phone with apple customer support they're
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:29:00.940]  told repeatedly you cannot get back on into your account right because and again when
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:06.140]  i first read this i have to admit the first story that you and nicole published on this
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:13.480]  and i i i i know both of you and i certainly knew that it wasn't that you were making it
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:20.220]  up and it doesn't seem like you or certainly the wall street journal's brand to exaggerate
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:26.020]  a problem to the point of unfair sensationalism but i thought well that can't quite be though
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:31.700]  that if you just know the device passcode you can just go in and change the apple id
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:38.140]  password without knowing the old apple id password and i go to settings icloud password
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:43.040]  and security change password and then it's just a field where you can type a new password
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:49.620]  and you hit return and that's it and now you've got a new password on your apple id and now
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:55.960]  it's because and at that point the per if it's a thief who did it and their goal is
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.160]  just to empty your bank accounts or whatever they're not looking they don't really care
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:05.900]  about the fact that they now they've got your apple id at icloud.com email and can send
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:11.060]  email as you they just want to use it to empty the bank accounts or your venmo or your paypal
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:18.180]  or whatever else you've got hooked up to your to your phone apple pay apple pay the main
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:22.320]  one right and and then they can log in and what what happens what's the what happens
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:27.500]  if you if they go to log into your bank and they don't know your bank password and you
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.720]  say i forgot my password what happens a lot of the times they the bank will just say okay
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:36.520]  we sent a password reset to your email but they've got your phone and then they go to
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:40.820]  your email and they can click the thing that says okay reset my password and now they've
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:46.540]  set a new password for your bank account or your credit card yeah and and the biggest
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:50.660]  really the biggest thing too we've seen the most damage to victims who were using icloud
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:55.540]  keychain because once you have the password it unlocks icloud keychain there's no other
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:31:01.260]  second form of authentication to get into that password manager on the phone so in the
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:06.500]  worst cases they had and i no longer have this set up on my phone i no longer have any
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:10.900]  of my bank account information set up in icloud keychain but those that had their chase account
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:15.980]  or bank of america account with icloud keychain hooked in well that was like basically game
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:20.780]  over they were draining accounts yeah and it didn't you think well then this must be
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:26.660]  a bug and apple will fix it what a what a crazy bug to exist but it's not it it actually
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:34.180]  is by design and as apple very is every time i've talked to them about it i'm sure they've
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:41.000]  said it to you about 150 times that the same thing is possible on android right i mean
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.460]  how many how many times did you hear that but it is true it is true it is true that
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:52.160]  if you cap if you take somebody's android phone and you know the device passcode you
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:57.460]  can do the same thing with their google account which is to an android phone what your icloud
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:03.480]  apple id is to your iphone you can change that person's google account and again it's
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:09.580]  devastating right how many people at this point have 15 years of their or longer of
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:14.840]  i forget when gmail launched but there's people who've over a decade of all of their personal
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:21.420]  email is their name at gmail.com and it's their login for more services than they can
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:28.580]  imagine and losing access to so it's true but why is it by design and i think it's clear
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:35.620]  and nobody to me at least apple won't just come out and say it on the record but it's
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:41.180]  it's about customer service that there are and it won't tell i've talked to them a lot
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:47.540]  about it i mean i'm sure not as much as you and nicole but there are tons of people thousands
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:53.220]  of people i don't know every day who lose access to their apple id because they don't
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:57.720]  remember their apple id password but they know their phone password and they actually
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.440]  use this feature they're like i can't get into it my apple id is asking me for my password
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:07.920]  i don't know it and they can call apple or go to the apple store and apple they'll say
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.660]  well do you know your device passcode and that's the one thing most people won't forget
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.420]  because you have to enter even with base id and touch id you have to enter your device
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:22.900]  passcode every time it restarts or a day goes by that you don't use face id or whatever
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:27.660]  okay now go to settings go to your iCloud and now you can type a new password for your
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:32.060]  apple id and you're back and all thousands and thousands of people a day are like oh
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:37.340]  thank you apple thank you google that i was able to recover my thing i won't forget my
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:43.100]  password this time and that's absolutely it that's absolutely it and i think the perspective
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:48.360]  of the company though you thankfully asked during your who i forget who was actually
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:53.120]  on stage at the time when you asked it's a craig and craig and jaws you you brought it
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.060]  up and they they he said we're on it i believe was the the ending thing we're on it so i
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.620]  think that was the direct quote so that that made me feel better but i think there is a
[01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:07.880]  real internal question right now of the convenience of setting up your of being able to easily
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.940]  reset a password for somebody who doesn't all the other ways they have to factor all
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:18.500]  the other stuff or they've they've forgotten a couple of the the key moments or key phrases
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:24.580]  in their passcode recovery and then there's balancing that with the fact that and it is
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:32.220]  not just a few there are many many victims of this hundreds and hundreds in specific
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:38.820]  cities across the country now and since publishing the pieces we continue to hear from more people
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:45.300]  in more cities where this has happened to them and the the as you mentioned that the
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:50.180]  financial damage is sad and it's hard and people they'll get over it because the banks
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:55.380]  refund their money the one that they don't get over and if the if the thieves have both
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:35:00.940]  changed the password and turned on the recovery key setting they are not getting back in their
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:05.260]  apple accounts and so that's often why these victims are reaching out to us and the original
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:09.820]  reason the victims started reaching out to me was they told me the story i mean i one
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:16.140]  of the first stories i heard from one of the victims and he's he's in one of the stories
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:20.040]  he told me a story he believes he was drugged this happened to him he woke up the next morning
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.620]  has no phone or has the phone that's he had a version of his phone had been replaced with
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:29.060]  another version of the phone and i just sort of didn't believe it i was like that sounds
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:34.180]  like a one-off that this sounds crazy to me yeah okay let me know if you hear more and
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:38.620]  he sent me more and then i started hearing from another guy who happened in another city
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:42.280]  so this this is happening and so i think that is the question internally how they're trying
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.180]  to balance the convenience of resetting with what is obviously happening to yes not as
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:53.260]  many it's not a billion people but it is happening to people and i don't know what the answer
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:59.660]  is i guess i think one one answer would be and it wouldn't solve the problem for everybody
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:06.860]  and and it wouldn't solve it for most people but for people who are overly concerned about
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:10.860]  this people who are paying attention who've read your story who listened to this show
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.920]  and are thinking well what can i do i would like to put an added layer of protection on
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:21.100]  my account some kind of opt-in way to say i i would like i would like not to be able
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:26.900]  to change my apple id password just with a device passcode i would like to have to know
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:32.360]  my apple id passcode or when you turn this on it would say okay now here's a list of
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.320]  one-time codes you can use to to reset it if you do forget your passcode keep this in
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.900]  a safe place put it where you put your passport or your will or whatever other precious document
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:50.540]  you have everybody's got i have a couple printouts like that for certain of my accounts and then
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:56.680]  it would be for me i've chosen not to be able to reset my apple id or or change my apple
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:02.220]  id password just with the device passcode even though maybe that's still the default
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:08.180]  for most people i don't know or maybe something even for the masses maybe there's some kind
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:14.820]  of 24-hour delay 24-hour delay i think is one is a big one and i think you know we also
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:20.780]  did a dedicated second piece to the recovery key because that is also another vulnerability
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:25.580]  in the sense that what happens is even if you've set up your recovery key right you're
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:30.940]  you're john grouber you're a good apple samaritan you have set up your recovery key you have
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:35.360]  printed it out you have it sitting in your desk drawer and your top secret lock or in
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:43.760]  your very secure acura you you have it turned on but in if a thief has your passcode steals
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.860]  your phone they can turn off that recovery and they generate a brand new recovery key
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:53.920]  so you go to apple and say no no my phone was stolen last night i am john grouber i
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.820]  have the the recovery key i have it right here this is the right code they'll say no
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:04.060]  that's not the recovery key on the account there's a new one the other thing that might
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:08.700]  be worth turning on i'm sure people listening there's the people who've turned it on or
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.220]  are already screaming at the podcast and they're like i know they already mad there what about
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:19.340]  screen time screen time right and so you can turn on in screen time even if you if you're
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.380]  most people think of screen time passcodes is something that you set for your kids as
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:28.340]  a parent to to limit the amount of time they can use but you could do it for yourself and
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:35.200]  one of the options in screen time is to say protect any password changes using the screen
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:43.260]  time password and now you've got a second passcode that they might not know and superficially
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:48.720]  if you're if you're a naive thief that definitely might keep you from doing it if you don't
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.660]  know about it but i don't think anybody who's running an organized thieving ring and of
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:59.440]  doing this over and over again is unaware of the fact that you can reset your screen
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:06.220]  time passcode guess what with your device passcode if you know the device passcode you
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:12.100]  can override the screen time passcode and you have to go through you have like three
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:16.700]  different screens and claim that you forgot the passcode that you never knew in the first
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:21.400]  place but eventually you just keep saying i forgot it i want to reset it and then it'll
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.700]  say well what's the device passcode and if they have the device passcode boom the screen
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:36.940]  time passcode is gone it does not protect you yes but i will just say here that if it
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:41.620]  yes they would have to know how to do this but one thing we know about these crimes is
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:48.420]  how quickly they are resetting yeah so this would slow down in right actually two or three
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:54.780]  instances we have heard from victims who immediately asked to borrow a friend's phone yep to do
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:40:01.040]  find my realized they had been locked out within a minute yep right yeah so this could
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:06.140]  slow down somebody at least till they get it and the way they these these i know a lot
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:11.500]  about sort of the way these organized crime groups work at this point they have groups
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:16.320]  as they go out to the bars and so they're handing the phones off each person has a real
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.380]  role in the crime one person's job is to get the passcode one person's phone job is to
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.780]  get the phone one person's job is to then do a lot of the stuff on the phone to make
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:31.180]  sure they're locked out yep so this is a big team effort so i i do believe it could slow
[01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:34.920]  people down but you're totally right we shouldn't give people a false sense of security i don't
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.020]  think it hurts to do it i have it set up on mine yep we'll leave it at that yeah we need
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.980]  a better solution from apple at the end of the day we need a better solution from apple
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:45.820]  yeah and if you're not roofied and you're aware that your phone's missing and you're
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.580]  at a bar and you think oh my god my phone was probably stolen i'm at a bar it's 12 30
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:57.660]  at night yeah giving an extra two minutes of buffer around it could could absolutely
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:01.820]  make the difference so i'm not saying don't use it i'm just saying don't be fooled into
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:06.440]  thinking you're completely protected my my i've repeated this on the show when i've talked
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.320]  about your your nicole's coverage of this the number one tip i have about this is guard
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:20.060]  your device passcode preciously in the way that like if a random stranger on the sidewalk
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:24.540]  like some guy with a clipboard was like hey what's your social security number you would
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.620]  be like what no what kind of a weirdo are you i'm not going to give you my social security
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:34.600]  number treat your device passcode like that like a super secret thing and if you're ever
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:39.620]  out in public and your face because it there's tricks people can pull like you guys covered
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:43.560]  this where one of the tricks they'll pull is let's say a group of people are out they
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.140]  seem to be celebrating a pal's birthday and a stranger will say let me get a picture of
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:53.220]  all of you here give me your phone and they'll take the picture and then if they just squeeze
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:58.080]  the power button for three seconds as they hand the phone back to you that that puts
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:03.140]  the phone in a mode where you need you don't you can't unlock it with face id you have
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:07.580]  to enter your passcode and that's a it's a great tip to know like i always do that when
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:14.300]  i go through tsa i i squeeze my phone and when i put my phone through the conveyor belt
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:19.340]  it's in a mode where face id won't work anymore everybody should know it but the thieves know
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:24.660]  it too and now you you get your phone back oh let me see the picture this this guy took
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:29.500]  and it's like huh face id doesn't work enter your passcode oh one two three four and you're
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:34.100]  in and you're looking at the photo meanwhile the guy's partner is looking over your shoulder
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:39.000]  and sees that your code is one two three four and now they've now all they have to do is
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.420]  get the phone again absolutely it's it and it's like when we put this all together we're
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:50.460]  like holy this is so smart it really is the other thing i tried just as like i sort of
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:58.100]  had my son sit down and just hold his phone and i shot four with my iphone shot 4k video
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:05.300]  over his shoulder and then like looked at the video and with 4k footage you can easily
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:10.100]  see what they're typing on on the phone when you zoom in totally and it's very we've done
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.380]  that too we've also pretended like you're pretend like you're typing but you're actually
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:19.740]  filming yeah yeah it's it yeah so it's great that we have these 4k cameras but if you're
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:25.540]  a thief looking to glean little tiny details like what they're typing on their phone from
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:32.020]  four feet away it's really convenient for them too to have really nice high resolution
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:36.820]  4k footage that you can zoom in on uh and apparently an even better zoom camera coming
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:44.340]  on the 15th so so i would but i agree with you number one thing just even i i am on the
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:50.740]  subway all the time now but looking at people how often people put in that password or passcode
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:55.040]  and a lot of people wrote to us and i've seen them a lot of the youtube comments why would
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:00.860]  anyone be putting in their passcode why wouldn't you be using face id there i mean face id
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:05.560]  doesn't always work also the changes they made during covid to make it get quicker to
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:12.580]  that passcode screen it's all there and i see it all the time it would be well i i guess
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:17.140]  if we had another hopefully we don't but if we had another pandemic and we had to start
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:23.340]  wearing masks again i guess we've got the option now to to do face id with a mask but
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:30.120]  i i when i read your story i thought back of how many hundreds i guess thousands honestly
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:36.940]  thousands of times i entered my phone passcode in public during covid because face id didn't
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:41.340]  work with a mask for so much of the time i would never do i remember they sped it up
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:46.520]  there was an update where they made it quicker to get to the passcode screen yeah i it happens
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.940]  like i mean i also think like look it's later at night you're not getting all things lined
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:56.340]  up now i think face id works far better on newer phones too they try to go after new
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.960]  or phones because they have higher resale value but it happens yeah and it they've also
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:06.420]  improved apple has definitely improved face id with more brands of sunglasses uh it was
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:11.700]  a huge problem when the iphone 10 came out like uh i know ray bands in particular for
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:15.680]  whatever you know which is super popular brand and was actually the brand of sunglasses i
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:21.940]  own that you couldn't use face id through their lenses um they've really improved that
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:25.720]  over the years and i know there's an option where you could say don't require attention
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.280]  so it would work but any face id is better than entering your passcode but if you ever
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.860]  find yourself hey i for whatever reason you have to enter your passcode on your phone
[01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:40.540]  and you're in public you should go somewhere private go to the corner of the room just
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:45.980]  in the same way that you wouldn't write down your atm pin code in front of strangers don't
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:50.700]  enter your device passcode in front of strangers the second tip i would have and i don't do
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:56.700]  it i still have all my stuff in in icloud keychain but i know the risks and i'm doing
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:00.580]  it knowing the risks but if you're really worried about the fact that anybody with your
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.720]  device passcode could get everything in your icloud keychain you should switch to a third
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:11.900]  party password secret manager like one password or something like that because that's an entirely
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:17.580]  different password that is separate from your device passcode and so if anything in your
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:24.540]  one password is never going to be gleanable by somebody who who in part of this criminal
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.260]  ring that you guys are documenting yeah and in venmo you can set up a second password
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:36.580]  as well so it's an extra four digit security code above the usual main apple passcode but
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:43.580]  i would also say that i was really hoping at wwc to see in ios 17 this rumored passwords
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:49.020]  app yeah because i thought okay this could be part of that solution one i think icloud
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:53.220]  keychain has always been really buried in settings you barely know that it's there and
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:57.180]  then two maybe this password app could have that extra layer of security on it you have
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:03.080]  to set up another passcode password on top of it right your your master password but
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:07.300]  we didn't hear anything yeah i forget the actual numbers and i forget too so it's all
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:12.640]  ballpark but it's you know but the basic story i was told by people who work in the security
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:19.020]  area at apple is after touch id came out which is a long time ago at this point it was what
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:27.860]  the iphone 5s i think the single biggest change from apple's perspective that touch id made
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:36.580]  to make the average iphone user's life more secure was the unbelievable increase in the
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:41.540]  number of users who had previously had no passcode at all on their iphone because they
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:46.380]  were so sick of typing four digits even a four digit ones whereas once they added touch
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:49.980]  id and they just had to put their thumb on it but you have to have a device passcode
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:55.500]  to use it the number of iphones that had no passcode at all dropped to near zero which
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:00.340]  was a huge difference and it's bananas and people who are concerned about this stuff
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:05.780]  were thinking you know even when it was the iphone 4 and 4s before touch id the idea that
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:10.220]  you would have your iphone with all of the stuff on it without any passcode at all seems
[01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:16.140]  crazy but people totally but most people go towards what's can most convenient and easy
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:22.420]  and they don't really think about things like that they do and i think the there there's
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:27.300]  been talk of adding second layer right would there would there would apple ever add a back
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:33.140]  the the fingerprint sensor and have face id as a second layer right if your fit your face
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:38.140]  isn't worth and you use your finger then you have the passcode as a backup but one other
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.940]  thing that was very revealing in all of this because one of our tips was to actually just
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:46.100]  make your passcode stronger right you can use a six digit you can use alphanumeric apple
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:51.660]  gives you the ability sorry you can use you do that on your passcode six digit or or or
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:56.400]  alphanumeric how many people were still on yeah yeah i'll bet it's really i bet it's
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.500]  a high number and one two three four yeah or zero zero zero yeah because and i forget
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:07.340]  what they do i know when you enter like zero zero i think that's kanye's yeah and he entered
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:12.220]  it into white house while he was on camera i know it gives you a warning like hey that
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:16.860]  yeah it's easily that is a super easily guessable but you can still say yeah that's what i want
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:22.100]  one two three four yeah yeah people do it and people really do it and believe me i i
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:26.820]  hate to say i'm watching people on the subway and i don't mean to be learning what their
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.980]  passcodes are i'm just seeing i'm looking around i've been looking around for months
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:34.220]  even before writing this story because we were so really looking into it and i'm like
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:39.180]  oh man that person has one two three four you can see from the way the hand movements
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.860]  or you can definitely see when it's the same digit right because it's just do do do do
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:46.540]  no hand movement at all it's i'd be such a good beef at this point yeah you really would
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:50.020]  you guys you and nicole should turn to a life of crime god wouldn't that be wouldn't that
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:56.220]  be a great story if the the the crusading consumer tech reporters for the wall street
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:02.060]  journal investigated everything there is to know about this iphone thieving ring and then
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:12.420]  you guys became like the oceans 11 of i mean i i would i would love to skirt the fbi on
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:17.140]  this one my other tip is that what you can do i it's pretty easy once you know you can
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:22.900]  do it but when you go to create a new device passcode you can set up a numeric one of an
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:28.500]  arbitrary digit length it doesn't just have to be four or six you can make like a custom
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:35.320]  one of nine digits or something like that and it's not just easier to remember maybe
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:41.020]  but it's certainly easier to type on a phone and and and also very very secure as long
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:45.620]  as somebody isn't looking at you enter it and if they're looking at you it doesn't matter
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:50.060]  if it's using the alphanumeric keyboard or not they're going to be able to see it but
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:54.420]  you could set like an eight digit passcode and just put like i don't know a phone number
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:51:00.620]  and two more digits to make it unguessable and you've got a very strong passcode and
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:06.740]  when you enter an arbitrary length passcode like that the screen doesn't even tell a thief
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:11.600]  how many digits it is so they don't even know if it's eight or seven or nine it's just a
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:16.300]  field where you see bullets until you hit the enter key and and put it in so that would
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:22.820]  be my other tip is if you want the ease of using the numeric pad with your thumb for
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.780]  entering it don't even use a six digit one make a custom seven or eight digit passcode
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:32.640]  or even use a six digit code but have it so that they don't know how many digits it is
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.300]  but if you're going to do custom you might as well go to like nine digits or something
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:45.900]  yeah all right uh i i we finally covered it i'm going to make a promise that you it will
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:50.020]  not be a full calendar year before you're back on the show i'll come back when apple
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:54.540]  makes changes that would definitely we'll have to have an emergency podcast we'll have
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:59.740]  to emergency podcast and i really do hope i i was really really happy so thank you for
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:03.880]  asking them about that on stage i was happy to hear that well and it wasn't just it wasn't
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:09.060]  even a favor to you honestly i i asked because i i really do think it was again one of the
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:12.900]  most interesting stories of the year and it affects every single person who owns one of
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:16.940]  these devices and that's everybody because it's every android i mean apple's obviously
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:21.420]  not going to ship a solution for android but you know well the big thing i mean this is
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:25.660]  the and everyone has said why are you uncovering android these thieves do not go after and
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:31.140]  no that you had a great quote from the detective in minnesota it was like well i don't know
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:36.220]  it's all i know is we caught 50 we have 57 victims and they're all iphone owners yeah
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:41.840]  99 or iphones i mean and it's a hundred percent and i am still looking at the story a little
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:47.100]  bit and nicole and i are trying to figure out if we can if we can keep digging but this
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:52.760]  is because of the resale value of the phones so it is funny that apple pr wants to say
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:56.980]  yeah but android too but then you say yeah but they only take iphones because the resale
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:04.980]  value is higher and it's actually in the iphone's favor in a in a way but they don't right it's
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:08.480]  a good thing for apple but in the context of being a target of thieves they don't want
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.000]  it they don't it it's almost like it makes their pr heads explode because right they're
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.900]  like but on one hand this is really good people want to buy our phones because they will sell
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:21.920]  them for more on the other hand oh shit they can they don't do this but and it's been really
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:27.540]  interesting we have not heard from any android users and and it makes sense right most are
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:34.180]  on 13 and 14s right because there's higher resale value for the newer phones in many
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:38.880]  cases it's usually a brand new phone i think that they can obviously tell just from looking
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.460]  at the phone whether they don't have a case on it i can't tell you how many people have
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:47.700]  told me iphone 14 pro gold yeah like that was the one that went i had just gotten it
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:52.900]  or the max and the max is also better too because they can see the passcode so yeah
[01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:58.260]  they they want yeah and you it had nothing to do with crime but you also in the last
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:04.260]  year did a big big story on the whole used iphone market like when you when you sell
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:08.540]  them back to apple or whoever else like you trade in yeah where they go where do they
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:14.400]  go and what do they do but that and it's a huge industry and it's apple lisa jackson
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:20.980]  talks it up on stage in it's in terms of it being good for the environment because iphones
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:26.540]  have such lasting value that a three-year-old iphone goes through the refurb process and
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:31.420]  is a great buy at a great price for people to do it but it just shows like this whole
[01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:36.220]  industry is about three-year-old iphones or whatever two-year-old iphones but that's what
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:42.460]  makes them the target of thieves too that yeah the resale value is way higher for iphones
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:46.420]  yeah well maybe more to come on this we're looking into it i'm still on the i crime beat
