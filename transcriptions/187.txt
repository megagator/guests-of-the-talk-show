[00:00.000 --> 00:04.520]  In the old days if if I were gonna have a show it would we would have to be together
[00:04.520 --> 00:06.720]  you'd have to be like in a studio with me and
[00:07.520 --> 00:12.700]  You would think I would I would supply comfortable chairs for my guests and you you know
[00:12.700 --> 00:19.760]  I feel like forcing guests to use Skype is like you get like a folding chair that was that was outside and as like
[00:20.360 --> 00:22.360]  Rain scum on it, you know
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.160]  Yeah
[00:24.160 --> 00:26.160]  Yeah, it's nice to be on again
[00:26.160 --> 00:28.160]  I
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.220]  There's a couple of things we have to talk about I guess so there's always stuff to talk about but what there's a couple of
[00:35.220 --> 00:37.220]  recent posts that you've had on
[00:37.520 --> 00:43.680]  Your 500 ish word site. Is that what it's called? I know that's the domain. Yep 500 words. Yep
[00:44.480 --> 00:47.960]  But you wrote about the the end of virgin
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.160]  Virgin America, yep
[00:51.160 --> 00:56.080]  Can you summarize this and again you even empty? It's a perfect piece. I will put it in the show loads
[00:57.160 --> 01:04.040]  But it is perfect in so far as you admit that Virgin America only flew between a very small number of cities, right?
[01:04.040 --> 01:09.440]  So there's a large number of people who if you don't live in San Francisco LA or New York, you probably haven't flown virgin
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.640]  Right and and so yes
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.920]  So basically, you know
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.360]  I'm assuming it by this point because it's been a bit of like a month or so. Everyone knows that
[01:17.360 --> 01:20.640]  Alaska Airlines bought Virgin America and
[01:21.320 --> 01:24.160]  As a part of that, you know, they sort of did this whole big
[01:24.720 --> 01:31.200]  branding thing certainly around San Francisco and I assume other cities in which virgin operates where it's sort of like the Alaska plus virgin equals
[01:31.200 --> 01:32.040]  love
[01:32.040 --> 01:34.920]  you know type brand type marketing campaign and
[01:35.720 --> 01:40.240]  Because obviously people were worried when someone else bought Virgin America that there would be
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.280]  You know would be the end of Virgin America and they were trying to sort of play it up
[01:44.280 --> 01:49.080]  No, this is just gonna make both sides even better and then whenever it was a few weeks ago
[01:49.080 --> 01:55.040]  they of course announced that they're going to be shutting down the Virgin America brand entirely and
[01:56.160 --> 01:58.160]  You know basically merging the planes
[01:58.840 --> 02:04.360]  And in sort of merging all into one entity which of course I'm sure makes sense for the bottom line
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.360]  That's the reason why they're doing it
[02:06.720 --> 02:08.720]  for cost efficiencies, but
[02:08.720 --> 02:14.720]  Yeah, I mean so people who don't live in one of the cities that Virgin America services
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.320]  Which is I'm not even sure what the current number is, but let's say it's 10 might be 12 or something like that
[02:19.320 --> 02:23.960]  It's not very many still started in San Francisco. The company was was headquarters here
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.080]  Obviously was famously, you know started out of Richard Branson's virgin group
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.040]  and
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.440]  So people who don't live in one of those 10 to 15 whatever it is now cities, you know
[02:36.440 --> 02:43.680]  Sort of don't really understand why people who do live in one of those cities and take Virgin regularly are sort of upset about this
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.080]  And the best pushback that I found most amusing was on Twitter
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.240]  You know basically saying but Alaska Airlines is such a great airline, too
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.680]  And you know, I've been on Alaska certainly any flight that goes so like to sort of the Pacific Northwest
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.040]  You know, that's sort of one of the common carriers and it's fine. It's it's a nice airline, you know, it's not United
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.040]  I'm sure we could think about that in a second, but
[03:05.040 --> 03:11.600]  It's it's fine, but it's not Virgin America. You have to be on a Virgin America plane to know what that's like
[03:11.600 --> 03:15.960]  I mean if you think back to when it when it started whenever that was several years back
[03:16.560 --> 03:19.160]  You know the fact that they were all sort of new planes
[03:20.600 --> 03:23.040]  The basic thing that I highlighted it
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.100]  you know in that in that post is I think people don't understand like
[03:26.280 --> 03:31.760]  You got a level of consistency flying Virgin America that you don't get with any other airline because it's a total crapshoot
[03:31.760 --> 03:36.740]  Whether you're gonna get an old rickety plane whether you're gonna get one with like, you know, still cigarette
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.600]  Yes
[03:43.600 --> 03:48.680]  And with Virgin sort of because it was you know a newer airline they had all the same
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.940]  I think it was a 380 planes. No, they three days the big one. Whatever the whatever the Airbus is
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.840]  321 I could might be that yeah, maybe it's one of those, you know, there's sort of standard and smaller
[03:59.840 --> 04:07.560]  Airbus planes and so they were all that they all had Wi-Fi which at the time, you know was was a novelty certainly
[04:07.760 --> 04:13.120]  They all had those televisions in the screen backs not just in first class or anything and all the screens all the seats
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.720]  Sorry had that and you had a very consistent experience. You knew if you're getting on a Virgin America flight it was
[04:19.120 --> 04:20.960]  More likely to be a good flight
[04:20.960 --> 04:24.000]  I mean, I'm sure there, you know, everyone will have a horse story about every airline
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.240]  But it's not like it's not like you hear about
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.360]  United and Delta and some of the other ones that are just you know, constantly a crummy experience
[04:31.360 --> 04:36.360]  This was this was a definitely a notch above we had them in Philly
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.760]  Until about two years ago and we lost them
[04:41.960 --> 04:48.580]  We lost Virgin during the in the aftermath of the American or the merger us air merger
[04:48.680 --> 04:51.800]  I've told this story before but long story short. It's very simple
[04:51.800 --> 04:56.320]  When when US Air and American proposed merging?
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.520]  one of the problem areas was that it gave the combined airline too many gates at
[05:03.200 --> 05:06.880]  JFK in New York that that the F or the federal aviation
[05:06.880 --> 05:11.560]  there's some kind of limit to the percentage of gates that any one airline can have in any Airport and
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.060]  US Air and American both had a big presence at JFK and it was too many gates
[05:16.320 --> 05:18.800]  So they had to get rid of some of the gates and Virgin
[05:18.800 --> 05:26.720]  decided they would rather take more gates at JFK but leave Philly entirely but and they couldn't keep both because one of the problems of
[05:26.720 --> 05:28.720]  Being an airline is it's really hard to get more planes
[05:28.720 --> 05:33.800]  I mean, it sounds silly because you think like oh you just buy, you know, call Boeing up and buy a plane
[05:34.240 --> 05:36.240]  right, you know, I mean like if you and I bought a
[05:36.760 --> 05:42.520]  Started a moving company and and it took off and we needed more trucks. We could just go buy more trucks, right?
[05:42.520 --> 05:47.440]  That's not a problem. But in aviation, it's a you know, you gotta like order an airplane like couple years in advance
[05:47.440 --> 05:49.160]  So that's such a long lead time
[05:49.160 --> 05:51.440]  Yeah, and so I've been off Virgin for a while
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.480]  But I still get the emails like I got the email the other day from Alaska telling me not to worry
[05:55.480 --> 05:57.480]  my points are okay, and it's
[05:57.760 --> 06:01.280]  Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, we'll see of course, you know
[06:02.520 --> 06:06.600]  Alaska's trying to say all the right things, you know in there in the sort of press statement about it
[06:06.600 --> 06:11.680]  They said we're going to be sort of bringing the Virgin experience to Alaska flights
[06:11.680 --> 06:16.280]  And so including the humorous bit about there being mood lighting, you know
[06:16.280 --> 06:22.640]  that's one of the that's like the thing they decided to focus on because Virgin America sort of famously has this this purple-hued mood lighting and
[06:22.640 --> 06:25.480]  So Alaska is gonna do that, but they're gonna have blue mood lighting
[06:25.480 --> 06:30.320]  So it will be it'll be not the exact same but it will be almost as good and we'll see
[06:30.320 --> 06:35.440]  I mean, you know, they said that that basically nothing was going to change and then of course everything's changing
[06:35.440 --> 06:41.920]  So, you know don't have a lot of a lot of hope for it remaining as it was the good news
[06:41.920 --> 06:44.320]  If there is like, you know slight good news
[06:44.320 --> 06:48.200]  It's going to take them a long time to sort of phase in and out those changes
[06:48.520 --> 06:55.320]  and so Virgin will remain operating for for I think at least like a year maybe a couple of years something like that, but
[06:56.280 --> 07:01.640]  Yeah, it'll be it'll be a big change in and as we're seeing this week with the the airline industry
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.880]  This is sort of par for the course just doing anything to screw over customers
[07:05.880 --> 07:08.000]  I think they only had two or three gates and it Philly
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.520]  So it wasn't a lot of flights. It wasn't a big presence and it was a small desk for check-in
[07:13.520 --> 07:18.400]  You know usually like two people so it's not a fair comparison to like
[07:19.120 --> 07:21.120]  American which dominates Philly
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.480]  but
[07:23.480 --> 07:26.360]  Every time I every time I could fly virgin I did
[07:27.080 --> 07:32.200]  And I you know, they had a great non-stop service between Philly and San Francisco
[07:32.200 --> 07:36.280]  Which was it, you know does a very common flight for me for for work
[07:37.200 --> 07:41.360]  Every time I could I did and I never once had to wait like that
[07:41.360 --> 07:48.440]  It's just little things like that the people at the desk were like super efficient and and nice and you'd get up there
[07:48.440 --> 07:53.240]  And they would be like hey, you know, and then you'd you'd give them your ID and then they'd you know
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.000]  Take your bag if you had a bag to check or or give you it, you know
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  and you were gone and that was it and you only had
[07:58.040 --> 08:03.760]  No lines and never and and good service on the plane. My favorite story about Virgin was one time
[08:05.120 --> 08:09.240]  Also, I used to get I got the cheapest upgrades to first class. I don't understand
[08:09.240 --> 08:13.720]  They only had the way every plane. They're probably all the same. They only had like eight first-class seats
[08:13.720 --> 08:19.200]  It was like two rows of two. Yeah, or they still do I guess and every almost every time I flew
[08:19.200 --> 08:24.000]  I could get an upgrade from coach to first class for like a hundred bucks and I'd be like, yeah
[08:24.320 --> 08:30.140]  In general the first guy seats, I mean weren't super expensive when you compare it to what they are on other airlines
[08:30.840 --> 08:32.400]  so yeah, I
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.820]  Flew first class on virgin as a percentage higher than anywhere else and it wasn't because I had the points it was because it was
[08:37.820 --> 08:41.640]  So cheap to upgrade and the service was super terrific. The seats were super comfortable
[08:41.640 --> 08:45.160]  but one time I was up in first class and we actually pulled away from the
[08:45.560 --> 08:51.440]  Gate a little bit and then all of a sudden there was some kind of not a not a unpleasant commotion
[08:51.440 --> 08:54.880]  But like some kind of you know thing with the phone and and they're like, hey
[08:54.880 --> 08:59.440]  Hey, let's go back and they went back to the gate and some poor sap who had a connecting flight. That was late
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.520]  They went back to the gate. I'd say it set us back about three minutes
[09:03.520 --> 09:08.960]  they went back to the gate and let this guy on the plane and this guy this guy looked like he won the lottery because
[09:09.640 --> 09:12.800]  You know, he didn't ever hear about that. I've never seen it before
[09:12.800 --> 09:15.960]  I mean, maybe I've never seen it before because I wasn't in first class
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.120]  But I mean, I think even in coach you can kind of tell if they're I've never seen that if the plane stops backing up
[09:21.120 --> 09:23.120]  And goes forward again
[09:23.160 --> 09:26.160]  And it was a nice thing and I was happy for it because the three minutes
[09:26.160 --> 09:28.400]  What's the difference to the three minutes and coming out of it?
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.780]  Was it coming back from SFO to Philly and so you're probably gonna wait that's a long thing to take off anyway
[09:33.920 --> 09:36.460]  But for that poor guy who almost missed his flight
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.200]  They just it was you know thousands of dollars and happiness for that guy
[09:41.200 --> 09:41.960]  and I mean
[09:41.960 --> 09:47.280]  I've seen I've seen much more of the sort of the opposite version of that story where they get the plane is even pushed back
[09:47.280 --> 09:50.040]  From the gate, but they just closed the door and they will not open it
[09:50.040 --> 09:53.560]  Even though the person's there the plane is still there and the door is closed
[09:53.560 --> 09:58.920]  And so it's just they will not reopen it for those people not with Virgin but with like countless other airlines
[09:58.920 --> 10:04.040]  I've seen that yeah, and they were like in this the flight attendants were so nice. They were like, hey, you're here
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.200]  You're on don't want you don't have to run anymore. Take your time. Go find your seat
[10:07.200 --> 10:12.080]  Do you want us to bring you a drink and they were like he was like, this is amazing. Okay, sure. Yes
[10:12.880 --> 10:14.640]  You know, I'll take a coke, you know
[10:14.640 --> 10:17.600]  And it was but to your point that was sort of like that's also
[10:17.960 --> 10:22.080]  Definitely a part of sort of the overall experience with Virgin and I don't know what it is
[10:22.080 --> 10:24.080]  I don't know if they just if they hired
[10:24.280 --> 10:27.560]  Like from a different crop of people in the industry or whatnot
[10:27.560 --> 10:33.400]  But people generally didn't seem to hate their hate their jobs and hate their lives when they're working at Virgin whereas they do
[10:34.280 --> 10:37.480]  You know very often it seems like on many other airlines
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.900]  Yeah at the big ones and I think Alaska and it's like to your point. I I would compare Alaska to Southwest
[10:42.900 --> 10:47.100]  I haven't flown Alaska a lot. I've flown it. I think at least twice to
[10:47.100 --> 10:52.300]  When there was the XOXO conference in Portland, right? Is it coincided with?
[10:54.060 --> 10:58.320]  XOXO at least for three years coincided with
[10:59.100 --> 11:04.180]  the tail end of the iPhone introduction events in September where just by
[11:04.860 --> 11:08.260]  Somewhat coincidence or I guess not quite total coincidence
[11:08.260 --> 11:15.220]  but Apple targeting like the second week of September for iPhone events and XOXO targeting the end of the second week for XOXO
[11:15.220 --> 11:16.580]  at
[11:16.580 --> 11:18.020]  least twice
[11:18.020 --> 11:19.660]  For me to go to XOXO
[11:19.660 --> 11:26.020]  it made more sense to fly out to San Francisco at the beginning of the week wait and then fly San Francisco to Portland instead
[11:26.020 --> 11:28.340]  Of flying all the way back to Philadelphia and then to Portland
[11:28.860 --> 11:32.940]  And Alaska was like, you know was the best airline, you know had the most flights for that
[11:32.940 --> 11:36.500]  so I've flown Alaska at least twice and I would compare it to Southwest it's
[11:37.340 --> 11:43.020]  It's fine. It's I mean, it's Southwest. I've flown it a lot actually and I like it
[11:43.020 --> 11:46.100]  It's sort of like, you know, it's like a nice
[11:46.900 --> 11:48.620]  Computer bus in the sky, right?
[11:48.620 --> 11:53.060]  Cuz they don't have assigned seats and but you get like sort of these numbers and you stand and then you get on the plane
[11:53.060 --> 11:55.820]  You can just pick whatever seat you want and it's like very simple
[11:56.740 --> 12:01.580]  You know, you always I think you always get the same type of plane. So that that's sort of a similar experience
[12:02.660 --> 12:09.880]  But again, I mean that it's nice but it cannot compare it to what Virgin Virgin America like is like the one that does
[12:09.880 --> 12:15.960]  Was supposedly which I have not been on yet. I wonder if you have is the jet blue mint experience
[12:16.360 --> 12:19.640]  Could we don't have I've not been on that or maybe we do we have jet blue
[12:19.640 --> 12:25.440]  But they don't fly anywhere I go out of Philly. I think yeah, and I think I think San Francisco has jet blue as well
[12:25.440 --> 12:27.440]  but I don't think the mint thing is
[12:27.880 --> 12:31.480]  Currently in play or at least it's not like if I would take jet blues
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.080]  I think I've taken it once before and I've taken it to New York because obviously most of time I would take Virgin
[12:37.080 --> 12:39.080]  But I don't think the mint
[12:39.080 --> 12:44.680]  Service operates between San Francisco and New York. Hopefully they change that maybe with the Virgin News, but it's like LA to New York
[12:44.680 --> 12:50.120]  I think has it and people rave about it when they take that they they say it's at least as good as Virgin if not better
[12:50.120 --> 12:52.100]  I don't really know
[12:52.100 --> 12:58.580]  You know all the all the perks and everything having not taken it before but I guess it's that's one to look forward to potentially
[12:58.680 --> 13:01.840]  hmm, and it's just an industry and and I
[13:02.320 --> 13:05.120]  It's you you've made it in your column
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.160]  You made it a sort of comparison to like Apple and Dell or something like that
[13:09.160 --> 13:13.360]  Maybe you ask is maybe more like Lenovo, you know, we're like, I think that is a nice laptop
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.900]  But it's right. It's not it's not a Mac, you know, it's it's what happens if somebody really tries to make something
[13:21.740 --> 13:23.940]  really good in an industry where
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.480]  That was fine is generally considered good
[13:28.480 --> 13:35.080]  I'm really lucky. You know, my my fight was flying. It was more or less on time
[13:35.080 --> 13:37.080]  we landed more or less on time and and
[13:37.520 --> 13:39.520]  None of my luggage got lost
[13:39.560 --> 13:41.120]  Right. I was it was funny
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.520]  We were I was chatting actually with a in our internal work slack
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.180]  with some people about the news and of course everyone's sort of outraged right when it hits and so like there's this long thread going
[13:51.180 --> 13:54.320]  on and that was the thing that I quoted a co-worker mine Ken was like
[13:54.860 --> 13:56.860]  You know comparing it to who?
[13:56.860 --> 14:01.260]  Yeah, sort of the the PC versus Mac thing, which I thought would be fun because of course that always
[14:02.020 --> 14:04.020]  You know draws
[14:04.060 --> 14:08.400]  Such heated debate on both sides for that and whenever you compare anything to
[14:09.020 --> 14:13.180]  To that situation, but I mean, I think it does feel fairly apt
[14:13.980 --> 14:15.980]  You know having been myself
[14:16.220 --> 14:21.980]  you know a longtime PC user when I was growing up and then switching to the Mac and just like I was PC user and
[14:21.980 --> 14:25.700]  It was fine and like yeah, I would get a faster PC and sometimes
[14:25.700 --> 14:32.800]  You know windows would break down and and that would suck but when it worked it was fine. And then you know, it's
[14:33.500 --> 14:38.700]  It was a totally different experience once I switched over. Yeah, it's I mean do you have air pods on Bob at you do?
[14:38.700 --> 14:43.780]  Oh, yeah, I love the alright, so I do too. It's my favorite my favorite thing in the last few years
[14:43.780 --> 14:47.740]  I think yeah, seriously, I love them so much, but that's it in epitomizes
[14:48.620 --> 14:53.020]  What Apple stands for to me, which is let's try to make this as nice as possible
[14:53.020 --> 14:55.940]  even if it's so such a simple thing is just
[14:56.460 --> 15:01.180]  Putting two earpods in your ear and having them just work when you hit play on your phone
[15:01.460 --> 15:04.340]  yeah, and just taking it to like just
[15:06.020 --> 15:12.860]  Just keep going into tenths of a decimal ninety nine point nine nine nine percent nice ninety nine point nine nine nine percent nice and
[15:12.860 --> 15:17.020]  Sweating right after detail. That's the Apple way and and it's not like apples perfect
[15:17.020 --> 15:23.080]  I'll put my favorite example from recent years of Apple totally falling short on this is the remote control for the new Apple TV
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.160]  Oh, yeah, right, which is like how does how did this ever come out of Apple as okay? Because this is so
[15:30.060 --> 15:36.740]  It is fine and it's not you know what I mean? And it's not right. It's not like it's not like a Comcast remote with
[15:37.740 --> 15:39.180]  127 buttons
[15:39.180 --> 15:44.100]  Right. It is Apple like in certain ways, but it's totally on Apple like in other ways
[15:44.100 --> 15:50.340]  It's Apple like in certain ways although like I feel like everyone who has one has the exact same complaints
[15:50.340 --> 15:54.780]  And that complaint is that you never know if you're holding it right side up or upside down and like how did
[15:55.180 --> 16:00.780]  How did just you know just user testing even with amongst Apple employees? How did that not come up?
[16:00.780 --> 16:03.080]  I mean, that's like the first thing that comes up for everyone, right?
[16:03.380 --> 16:10.640]  But to me virgin was shooting for the air pods like experience from check-in to
[16:10.640 --> 16:17.240]  You know getting off the plane. That's what virgins is still stands for while they while they exist, but and
[16:18.460 --> 16:24.240]  Something like Alaska or Southwest which I'm a fan of I'm a big fan of so I've flown tons of miles on Southwest
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.680]  I don't anymore just because they've sort of dropped non-stop routes between the cities I go to and I'm as
[16:30.320 --> 16:35.840]  The longer and more I fly the more resistant I am to taking anything other than a non-stop
[16:35.840 --> 16:41.760]  But I really I do like them and I know that they're not luxurious
[16:41.760 --> 16:47.640]  But I the main reason I like them is that that they do seem to hire really nice people and the planes are very
[16:47.920 --> 16:54.040]  Consistent the Southwest plane is always clean and always exactly the same, but it's nothing like virgin
[16:54.040 --> 16:59.800]  Which was trying to say let's make this really nice. Let's make being in a coach seat like a decent humane experience
[17:00.440 --> 17:03.300]  And the thing that's really a bummer about it
[17:03.300 --> 17:09.340]  Is you know, so when virgin launched I remember it very well in San Francisco
[17:09.340 --> 17:13.980]  There was a lot of pomp and circumstances there is with many sort of Richard Branson affiliated things
[17:14.540 --> 17:20.740]  But you know deservedly so and the whole criticism at the time though was like, yeah, it's a great experience
[17:20.740 --> 17:24.460]  But they'll never be able to keep this going. They're not going to be able to run it profitably and
[17:25.140 --> 17:27.840]  This is just not the way the airline industry works
[17:27.840 --> 17:34.360]  You know in this day and age and you know, I think they were running unprofitably for a long time
[17:34.360 --> 17:37.600]  I do think that they eventually turn to profit or they were very close to it
[17:37.600 --> 17:43.480]  And so there was some hope you know that like look you can actually build an airline with a great experience that actually makes business
[17:43.480 --> 17:44.920]  Sense as well
[17:44.920 --> 17:51.560]  And then of course that just got thrown out the window and they merged I mean and all airlines continue to constantly merge
[17:51.560 --> 17:59.960]  and continue to constantly charge for more things for overhead storage just adding on fee after fee after fee and that's just the
[17:59.960 --> 18:03.160]  You know, that's the state of the industry and virgin
[18:03.160 --> 18:09.560]  It seemed like was trying to buck that trend and it ultimately, you know, just didn't didn't end up doing it. We'll see how
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.280]  Alaska
[18:11.280 --> 18:13.280]  sort of takes takes the
[18:13.440 --> 18:15.440]  takes the mantle but
[18:15.800 --> 18:17.440]  That's what's the real bummer about it?
[18:17.440 --> 18:21.960]  It just it sort of showcases that I think it just probably can't ever ever work
[18:22.080 --> 18:28.200]  it seems like a lot of people I know and it does make some sense, but it's to me key to the
[18:30.200 --> 18:35.000]  Continuing I don't even know if I want to say success cuz I'm not quite sure how profitable they are
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.080]  But the continuing dominance of the the major
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.120]  mediocre carriers your Americans Delta's United's
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.840]  natural is
[18:44.840 --> 18:52.200]  That they large, you know for obvious reasons they they largely depend on regular frequent fliers, right and
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.440]  People who once you start racking up points on a certain airline so many you're locked in
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.080]  Yeah, so I don't feel that way. I've got platinum status
[19:02.640 --> 19:09.960]  American and which is pretty nice and it gets me a couple of perks and I've got miles I can cash in whatever
[19:09.960 --> 19:16.560]  But every time I book a flight, I still search for other airlines just to look and if I found something
[19:17.240 --> 19:19.760]  Better or cheaper on a on a different airline
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.320]  Like I still check to see if Southwest is restored a couple of non-stops to San Francisco every day
[19:25.320 --> 19:26.920]  I look every once in a while
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.760]  Like I would think about going back to Southwest on certain flights, especially if I can and and or if I could get a better
[19:32.760 --> 19:34.760]  Time of day or something like that
[19:34.760 --> 19:40.240]  Yeah, I I'm I'm in the same boat as you I am not sort of beholden to any sort of point system
[19:40.240 --> 19:43.800]  I have the virgin points, of course, but as we just talked about like they didn't go all that many places
[19:43.800 --> 19:46.440]  so obviously I would have to take out their airlines all the time and
[19:47.280 --> 19:51.240]  So I think I have rewards programs at all of them and I don't have huge status
[19:51.240 --> 19:53.800]  but I've said it's at some of them I would say I fly quite a bit and
[19:54.440 --> 19:57.520]  But I'm not one of those people who you know is so adamant about
[19:58.480 --> 20:03.400]  Maintaining that versus just maintaining a good experience that said I do know people who are the exact opposite
[20:03.400 --> 20:09.640]  I know people who take flights to and from New York City just to maintain their status level
[20:09.640 --> 20:13.400]  Like they don't actually they don't actually stay overnight in a city
[20:13.400 --> 20:20.240]  They just do a round-trip flight on one day just to be able to maintain their status, which sounds absolutely insane. I
[20:22.360 --> 20:27.080]  It's just not that important to me and I just don't get that much for it
[20:27.080 --> 20:30.480]  You know like even as a platinum status person on American
[20:30.480 --> 20:37.560]  Like I still don't get I still have would have to pay to join their quote-unquote admirals club to get into the lounges like
[20:38.560 --> 20:46.440]  And I tend not to need lounges because I tend to just fly non-stop from home to my destination
[20:46.800 --> 20:53.240]  My destination to home and the only time I ever really need or wish I had access to a lounge is when my flights delayed
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.240]  If I get to the airport on time and the flight is significantly donate delayed and I've got you know
[20:59.240 --> 21:02.080]  Two or three hours to burn. Well, then it would be nice to be in a lounge
[21:02.080 --> 21:09.120]  You know some places I can get in the Amex lounge, but other airports don't have one, but it's not I don't even get it
[21:09.120 --> 21:10.780]  I have platinum status and I still don't get it
[21:10.780 --> 21:13.440]  So it doesn't make any sense to me and why people are so loyal like that
[21:13.440 --> 21:15.200]  But it really does seem to screw
[21:15.200 --> 21:21.240]  The upstart airlines like they can't that like one of the reasons they can't get traction as people like I've heard virgin is nice
[21:21.240 --> 21:23.360]  But I've got points on United. So
[21:23.360 --> 21:29.920]  Here I go. Yep. Yeah, it's uh, it's it's quite a racket that they that they run and like, you know, I think
[21:31.160 --> 21:35.480]  You know, there's certain other airlines that go internationally that are that are obviously very nice
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.280]  I'm actually getting ready to go to London and I'm gonna be on Virgin Atlantic. It's sort of sister thing
[21:41.280 --> 21:45.940]  It was like the sister thing, but they weren't exactly, you know affiliated for a long time their points didn't even transfer
[21:45.940 --> 21:50.160]  I think they do now but I think they set it up that way to make it easier to have
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.600]  Happened what actually happened which was the rail to sell one or the other without selling the other
[21:56.240 --> 22:01.320]  yeah, and Branson wrote like, you know a post-mortem or whatever and you know, sort of
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  made some reference to it, you know, like
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  losing a child and
[22:07.640 --> 22:12.880]  but there was all sorts of issues, you know with it with his ownership of it and
[22:14.200 --> 22:18.320]  Whether or not he could have actually blocked anything. It seems like no and so that's what happened
[22:18.320 --> 22:24.200]  I've never flown Virgin Atlantic, but I would love to and my favorite story about that and it relates to the show is way back
[22:24.200 --> 22:26.200]  in the day
[22:26.400 --> 22:31.400]  When Dan Benjamin and I were reviewing all the James Bond movies we were talking I know where you're yes
[22:31.400 --> 22:34.760]  We're talking about quantum of solace. Yes. I was just gonna bring that up. Yep, and
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.400]  Bond is is on on route from England to
[22:40.520 --> 22:45.280]  Where was he going somewhere in South America or the Caribbean right? Yeah, cuz he's with them
[22:45.280 --> 22:49.440]  He's with the the elder gentleman. Yeah. Yeah, and he's like a drink
[22:49.440 --> 22:49.800]  Yeah
[22:49.800 --> 22:56.200]  and and he's bereft and he's he's getting tanked at a there's a bar in the plane and
[22:56.400 --> 23:02.800]  With a bartender and he's sitting at the bar drinking Vesper martinis. He I don't know like 18 of them or something
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.120]  And it's a beautiful looking bar and Dan and I were like, it was a cool scene, you know
[23:08.120 --> 23:13.000]  And it's it's it's kind of unusual to see bond actually get get tank
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  He's always drinking but he's all never seems to be drunk and here he is, you know, drinking himself into a stupor
[23:18.920 --> 23:22.800]  But we were like, how unrealistic is it that there was a nice bar on a commercial air flight?
[23:22.800 --> 23:25.540]  And then all these people wrote to me like oh no, no, they have it. Yeah
[23:25.540 --> 23:31.840]  Yeah, that was actually shot on a real virgin Atlantic. It's like oh my god. I've got to get on that plane
[23:31.840 --> 23:38.040]  I mean, yeah, I've been on them. That's a hundred percent legitimate. They have those bar areas and it's amazing
[23:38.040 --> 23:42.000]  It's not usually as quiet as it was I would say that scene
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.460]  Right, there's usually much more people or activity around it. But yeah, that's that's legitimate. It's it's pretty amazing
[23:49.720 --> 23:55.560]  That was my fit with some of my favorite feedback ever. We were both like totally preposterous who would ever have a commercial
[23:57.520 --> 24:01.760]  It's like something out of the 1960s and and all these people wrote to us they're like, oh yeah
[24:01.760 --> 24:04.500]  It is it is real and it is nice and it's fantastic
[24:04.880 --> 24:08.680]  Yeah, and yeah the thing with virgin is so I rarely virgin Atlantic
[24:08.680 --> 24:15.160]  I rarely take it because it's for some reason it ends up being usually far more expensive than British British Airways
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.020]  And I just we just so happened to find a ticket that was roughly the same price
[24:20.020 --> 24:23.620]  And so we decided to book that because you haven't taken virgin
[24:23.620 --> 24:30.520]  But if you ever go to London in at Heathrow, they have an amazing lounge too. It's probably the best lounge
[24:30.520 --> 24:32.080]  I've ever been in
[24:32.080 --> 24:35.080]  Including you can get a haircut, you know, you can shower you can
[24:35.080 --> 24:40.120]  It's pretty nice they have a spa they have all this amazing stuff there the shower
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.120]  It would be nice because sometimes for whatever reason when you fly cross country, especially for you because you're coming from the West Coast
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.940]  I always feel like it's been like three days since I when I get off the plane like in Europe
[24:50.940 --> 24:54.120]  I always feel like man that felt like it was 72 hours. Yeah
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.700]  Yes
[24:56.880 --> 25:01.200]  So, yeah, I highly recommend that if if you ever going overseas, all right
[25:01.200 --> 25:04.940]  let me take a break here and thank our first friend of the show our good friends at
[25:06.040 --> 25:11.720]  Squarespace you guys know Squarespace. It's the best place to go to make a website register domain anything like that
[25:13.780 --> 25:18.160]  When you make your next move you're gonna need a website why not start it at Squarespace
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.060]  They've got beautiful templates. They've got beautiful types of sites
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.160]  To choose from to start so if you're making an online store
[25:27.160 --> 25:33.560]  you can start with a store and then choose a template from there if you're making a podcast you can start with something like a
[25:33.560 --> 25:39.600]  Podcast and boom you've got a podcast site. You didn't do any work. You can host your podcast right there from Squarespace
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.920]  You name the type of site you can build it with Squarespace and I say this
[25:44.920 --> 25:48.940]  This is what I think is the the resistance people might have to Squarespace is you say well
[25:48.940 --> 25:54.560]  everybody signs up for Squarespace and you choose from a handful of templates and then my site's gonna look like a Squarespace site because
[25:54.560 --> 25:59.880]  Every it's not like that they've got so many templates to choose from and so many ways to customize them
[25:59.960 --> 26:03.620]  That you don't even know when you're looking at a Squarespace site
[26:04.080 --> 26:05.360]  I
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.440]  Was just looking at a I mentioned this on during fireball last week
[26:08.440 --> 26:14.400]  There's a new cheesesteak place pretty near our place here in Philadelphia called cleavers really great new sandwich shop here
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.320]  I was looking at their their website to place the takeout order and
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.840]  One of the things you click on to see the menu load instead of as a page loaded as a standalone image
[26:24.840 --> 26:27.580]  And I could see the URL I could see it was hosted at Squarespace
[26:27.580 --> 26:31.960]  I was like whoa and I've also never view source and look and their whole site which is a really nice site
[26:32.160 --> 26:38.320]  But doesn't look anything like any other site I've ever seen it's very much strongly branded like the restaurant built with Squarespace
[26:38.360 --> 26:40.360]  But that makes total sense. Why would they waste time?
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.520]  Doing something outside their expertise like building a website when they could just do it at Squarespace
[26:46.520 --> 26:48.520]  And stick to building a great restaurant
[26:49.080 --> 26:55.480]  So keep them in mind next time you need a website for anything check out Squarespace go to Squarespace calm

[27:06.880 --> 27:10.400]  My thanks to them for their continued support of this podcast
[27:11.200 --> 27:13.800]  all right next next item on my list at least is
[27:13.800 --> 27:19.280]  Your reaction to the new MacBook pros, which yeah, so
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.320]  And I know you have thoughts on this as well
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.360]  And you sir the one thing that you linked to which I thought was interesting was a few weeks ago
[27:29.040 --> 27:37.040]  Sort of a poll right of people how they feel about it and so my general take is pretty straightforward
[27:37.040 --> 27:41.840]  I just I don't hate the touch bar. I just think it's totally useless
[27:41.840 --> 27:46.120]  I have a few apps. You know that are sort of tailored for it including things like pixelmator
[27:48.120 --> 27:52.120]  Handful of other things a bunch a bunch more that aren't of course
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.120]  But I honestly just switched the sort of
[27:57.120 --> 27:59.120]  the fluid
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.120]  Setting to be back to just the standard sort of F and or no I didn't sorry
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.120]  I didn't use the the F keys I used the function keys I use the
[28:07.120 --> 28:13.720]  Actual brightness and all that stuff because I like I just found myself going to that like way way more than I would use any
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.720]  Of the sort of dynamic options that the touch bar would off offer and I just I don't I
[28:20.320 --> 28:21.320]  Have a hard time
[28:21.320 --> 28:27.720]  I know it's early, but I have a hard time ever seeing that it becomes like this great feature of the MacBook Pro
[28:28.720 --> 28:30.720]  Do you disagree with that?
[28:30.720 --> 28:38.720]  Uh, no, I don't disagree. I feel like it exists. I feel like the touch bar as we have it right now exists in a sort of
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.720]  No, man's land where you cannot I don't think it's fair to trash it. I don't think it's fair to say this is great
[28:44.720 --> 28:46.720]  I feel like
[28:46.720 --> 28:48.720]  It's it's nuanced
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.720]  Now that said I don't own one
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.720]  So I've got I spent about two or three weeks when they first came out playing
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.720]  With the review units I had multiple of them but mostly spent the time at the 13-inch because that's the size I like
[29:03.720 --> 29:05.720]  And I love touch ID
[29:06.720 --> 29:09.720]  Yes, I don't use the hearted
[29:09.720 --> 29:16.720]  I don't use the escape key as much as some people do but I do use it and I do still even now even as somebody who
[29:16.720 --> 29:18.720]  doesn't use the escape key all the time I
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.720]  Question whether they should not have left a hardware
[29:22.720 --> 29:29.720]  I question whether they should not have left a hardware traditional escape key and made the touch bar just run from
[29:31.720 --> 29:34.720]  Escape have a escape key in the upper left corner
[29:34.720 --> 29:39.720]  The touch ID in the upper right and have the touch bar exist between the two
[29:39.720 --> 29:42.720]  I think right I think that because it would have given it more
[29:42.720 --> 29:45.720]  Symmetry as well because it's you know, they have one button on one side
[29:45.720 --> 29:51.720]  Why not have the escape button even if they change the size of it and made it square sort of like the right touch ideas
[29:51.720 --> 29:55.720]  but make it something you can actually click and I think that would have I I do feel like just
[29:56.720 --> 29:59.720]  Reading Twitter reading feedback from readers and stuff like that
[29:59.720 --> 30:04.720]  I feel like an awful lot of the criticism of the touch bar relates to the escape key
[30:06.720 --> 30:09.720]  As for the utility of the touch part itself, it's hard to say I do I
[30:10.720 --> 30:15.720]  I do I remember thinking it was really nice to adjust the brightness with the touch bar and I and I find it
[30:16.720 --> 30:19.720]  I find that so much more tedious honestly to do it that way
[30:19.720 --> 30:26.720]  You know, so here's before I switched it back to being sort of the brightness as as sort of default buttons
[30:26.720 --> 30:30.720]  So it has like, you know brightness and things like bring up expose and stuff like that
[30:30.720 --> 30:35.720]  You can there's a setting that you can you know, move it to rather than being the dynamic touch bar
[30:35.720 --> 30:42.720]  It's it's sort of your old standard buttons and I did that because I was actually using I think it's when you hit the function
[30:42.720 --> 30:43.720]  the FN key
[30:43.720 --> 30:48.720]  I think that would bring up the old ones and I was just using that all the time because even though there are what
[30:48.720 --> 30:54.720]  There is a brightness button on the dynamic version of the touch bar when you hit it
[30:55.720 --> 30:59.720]  Then you yeah, then you have to scroll sort of up or down and so often
[30:59.720 --> 31:05.720]  I just want like, you know one little nit more of brightness not like I don't need the sort of scrubbing
[31:05.720 --> 31:08.720]  You know to see all the way down and all the way up what the difference is
[31:08.720 --> 31:12.720]  It's like one of those features that just seems like a cool option on paper
[31:12.720 --> 31:15.720]  But when you actually use it, it's much less useful. Yeah
[31:15.720 --> 31:18.720]  So I don't know I can see the mixed feelings about it
[31:18.720 --> 31:25.720]  I I feel I feel like the biggest thing that it needs is haptic feedback. I feel like yeah
[31:26.720 --> 31:30.720]  and I was reminded of it just recently because I I'm a
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.720]  I'm I haven't used it a lot because I don't personally have a need but I'm fascinated by the new clips app
[31:35.720 --> 31:37.720]  And I think it's I think it's really well done
[31:37.720 --> 31:41.720]  Even though I realize some of the initial complaints from other people are that they're a little confused by it
[31:41.720 --> 31:47.720]  But I yeah, I think it's only confusing at first because it's ambitious and tries to do a lot
[31:47.720 --> 31:51.720]  And so there's a lot in there, but I feel like everything that they've done once you get it
[31:51.720 --> 31:56.720]  It's pretty logical. But the the thing that made me think of the touch bar is
[31:57.720 --> 31:59.720]  When you've got your you've got multiple
[32:01.720 --> 32:07.720]  Clips in a project in a row and if you want to rearrange them you you can force touch on one
[32:07.720 --> 32:13.720]  And you get like a little you get the haptic feedback as you drag it along to rearrange clips in the timeline
[32:14.720 --> 32:20.720]  It feels like so you want to move the one that's in the fourth spot to the second spot as you drag right between second
[32:20.720 --> 32:25.720]  And third you get a little it rumbles and you can feel it. Yeah, you can feel like it's like you're dragging it over
[32:25.720 --> 32:26.720]  physical slots
[32:26.720 --> 32:32.720]  and it's so nice and I just thought boy the touch bar would feel so much better if it had a little bit of feedback like
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.720]  that and that speaks to I think it was
[32:34.720 --> 32:36.720]  Michael Lopp right who wrote a post about
[32:37.720 --> 32:42.720]  You know the the usability factor of the touch bar because it's almost impossible to use without looking at it
[32:42.720 --> 32:49.720]  Which is also very odd right like because that's not what that row of buttons has been for the entire life of a MacBook
[32:50.720 --> 32:54.720]  and so to your point like if they had some sort of haptic feedback where you could actually
[32:54.720 --> 33:01.720]  Tell what you were doing while still keying on the screen like for scrubbing or doing some other action that would be
[33:01.720 --> 33:04.720]  Significantly better than having to look down because you don't know where you are
[33:05.720 --> 33:08.720]  Yeah, and I do feel like that's part of it. You know like
[33:10.720 --> 33:15.720]  Some of the ones in the middle I almost never use like I don't on the traditional F key row
[33:15.720 --> 33:21.720]  Like I don't really I almost never adjust the brightness of my keyboard keyboard. Yeah, you know saying sometimes
[33:21.720 --> 33:23.720]  it's like I'll be on like a
[33:24.720 --> 33:28.720]  Dark flight and I'm alright. Yeah, I'll adjust the brightness of my keyboard
[33:28.720 --> 33:31.720]  But I'll just do it once and it's fine for me to be looking at it
[33:31.720 --> 33:34.720]  But for like micro adjustments to the brightness of the screen
[33:34.720 --> 33:40.720]  I am I can do it without looking just by going up with my left hand to the top left
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.720]  I know where the escape key is and the next two or brightness and even if I'm wrong
[33:45.720 --> 33:48.720]  Even if I go up and I hit brightness up even though I wanted brightness down
[33:48.720 --> 33:54.720]  I can see what happened right away, and I know I'm right next door and just slide my finger and yep
[33:54.720 --> 33:59.720]  And do that without looking and I'm I'm with you with that and I'm the exact same way with volume
[33:59.720 --> 34:02.720]  And both of those are now problematic on the touch bar
[34:03.720 --> 34:07.720]  you know if they look nice like that nice, you know little scrubber and everything, but it just
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.720]  I do not like it at all. I mean, I don't hate hate it
[34:13.720 --> 34:15.720]  But I just don't see like I said
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.720]  I switch back to sort of the the old standards and like you said they're not physical
[34:20.720 --> 34:23.720]  Buttons and there's no haptic feedback. So they're harder to use
[34:23.720 --> 34:25.720]  So I have to actually pay attention to what I'm doing
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.720]  And then I also I do think I agree that touch ID is by far the best part of it
[34:31.720 --> 34:36.720]  But the weird thing there is that I almost never get to use it because I do have an Apple Watch
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.720]  And I'm always wearing the Apple Watch and that unlocks faster
[34:39.720 --> 34:44.720]  Than the touch ID does so before you can even reach up to the touch ID. It's done. So there's no point
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.720]  Yeah, well, it's good for purchases or whatever. Yeah for purchase logging in logging in is the big is you know
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.720]  The one you do I log in and out or you know
[34:52.720 --> 34:55.720]  Open it from sleep and log in way more frequently than I buy stuff
[34:56.720 --> 34:57.720]  Yeah
[34:58.720 --> 35:01.720]  And so what do you do? Why do you think that they did?
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.720]  the touch bar because like so part of the thing that I wrote was you know, sort of the
[35:06.720 --> 35:14.720]  The notion being that we've sort of reached peak form factor of the laptop
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.720]  And I know that's dangerous to say for sort of any technology that we've reached peak because there's always going to be some level of innovation
[35:21.720 --> 35:25.720]  And I think I made the quip that maybe we'll have Phil Schiller on stage saying can it innovate anymore my ass
[35:26.720 --> 35:29.720]  When they when they do something new with that with the MacBook
[35:29.720 --> 35:37.720]  But like my only line of thinking is either they're going to one day try to make it a bigger screen area
[35:38.720 --> 35:43.720]  Like the keyboard tray be being more maybe like haptic digital keys
[35:44.720 --> 35:50.720]  You know something like that or the or not even like replacing the entire keyboard, but just making that a bigger area
[35:51.720 --> 35:54.720]  You know for for different things that they can dynamically do
[35:54.720 --> 36:01.720]  I mean that has to be some line of thinking right it can't just be this this touch bar which isn't that interesting
[36:02.720 --> 36:11.720]  I guess I don't know but I find it worrisome if their goal is to replace hardware keyboard with a virtual keyboard
[36:12.720 --> 36:21.720]  Because I I can't see how that would like whatever my I kind of still prefer my older MacBook keyboard to the new one
[36:21.720 --> 36:24.720]  That's shallow keys. Yeah, it's in New York, but it's deeper keys
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.720]  But after two or three weeks my feelings went from I like the old one better to oh
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.720]  I have mixed feelings because I also feel though that my old one they feel loose and jank jank right and
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.720]  Whereas in the new ones even though they have shallower feel so clicking them feels worse because it's shallow
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.720]  But just resting my fingers on them feels better because they don't wiggle around they feel more premium
[36:47.720 --> 36:52.720]  Yep, and I had a problem at first. I had a really weird problem
[36:53.720 --> 36:59.720]  And I can't explain why but the the new keyboards in the MacBook and the Mac the just plain MacBook and the MacBook Pro
[37:00.720 --> 37:07.720]  Yep, have bigger keys and less space between the keys the keyboard takes up the exact same amount of area
[37:08.720 --> 37:14.720]  And so the distance between just pick two keys like the center of the a key and the center of the F key
[37:14.720 --> 37:16.720]  Alright is exactly the same
[37:17.720 --> 37:21.720]  So your fingers resting on the home row are exactly in the same position
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.720]  but for some reason because the keys are bigger I
[37:26.720 --> 37:30.720]  Felt for a while like my fingers were spread out more
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.720]  Yeah, I get that. I think that's something I needed to get used to I
[37:36.720 --> 37:42.720]  Especially notice it because I use the iPad keyboard all the time and that is those are smaller keys. Yeah, right. Yeah
[37:42.720 --> 37:48.720]  And so that's when I really notice it and I honestly I think I prefer the iPad keyboard as weird as that sounds I just
[37:49.720 --> 37:51.720]  It's not it's not a perfect keyboard
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.720]  But maybe it is like you're talking about sort of the size of the keys just something about it feels more familiar than typing on the newer keyboards
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.720]  Yeah, I can kind of see that like you're talking about like the smart keypad. Yeah. Yeah the one that Apple made
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.720]  It's almost like on the smart keyboard cover it it it celebrates the shallowness of the movement
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.720]  Whereas on the MacBook, it's like man. I still wish that these keys went in further
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.720]  Yes, but I can live with that
[38:19.720 --> 38:21.720]  I'm really
[38:21.720 --> 38:27.720]  The difference between my feelings about the new MacBook Pro keyboard and the previous generation MacBook Pro keyboard
[38:27.720 --> 38:30.720]  I have thoughts but the thoughts are
[38:31.720 --> 38:35.720]  much narrower than the thought between what we have now and a
[38:35.720 --> 38:41.720]  Hypothetical virtual touch bar. That was the whole keyboard. Yeah, like well, what do you think about this?
[38:41.720 --> 38:43.720]  like so the other thing that I that I've
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.720]  Chatted with some folks about is the notion of one way that I think they could have alleviated some of the touch bar
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.720]  Criticism is like also just putting it at the bottom of the keyboard
[38:55.720 --> 39:01.720]  So in other words keeping the function row that as it was and just adding a new row because like and especially on the MacBook
[39:01.720 --> 39:07.720]  So here's the thought here right now. They made the the touch pad the touch pad itself, right?
[39:08.720 --> 39:10.720]  Massive it's pretty big now
[39:10.720 --> 39:12.720]  I think it's bigger than it needs to be for anything
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.720]  And so you could shave that down a little bit and I think if you wanted to do some sort of touch bar type thing
[39:18.720 --> 39:22.720]  Put it just above the touch pad and sort of make that the whole touch area
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.720]  Especially because Apple's whole thing as we all know is that they're not going to do a touchscreen
[39:27.720 --> 39:30.720]  MacBook or iMac MacBook Pro anything
[39:31.720 --> 39:36.720]  And the weirdness of this whole dynamic right now is that they made a touch area
[39:36.720 --> 39:38.720]  That's so close to the screen
[39:38.720 --> 39:42.720]  but isn't the screen and you know, they make they have the the famous sort of picture of like
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.720]  You know with a crossed out arm or like pointing at the screen because it's just not
[39:47.720 --> 39:53.720]  Ergonomic right and it's not that much different in my book to sort of have to go up to this top row
[39:53.720 --> 39:56.720]  And have to sort of manipulate touch that way
[39:56.720 --> 40:00.720]  I would have been much more happy if where my hands already rest sort of at the bottom
[40:00.720 --> 40:02.720]  You try to do something with the touch bar
[40:02.720 --> 40:06.720]  I don't know my I just looking down at my MacBook as I as you say this
[40:06.720 --> 40:09.720]  My problem with that is that my hands would cover it most of the time
[40:09.720 --> 40:13.720]  I think the advantage to having it at the top is that you can see it your hands don't cover it
[40:13.720 --> 40:17.720]  Whereas this way your hands cover it until you go to look at it, but maybe that's okay
[40:17.720 --> 40:18.720]  I don't know
[40:18.720 --> 40:23.720]  I don't know if they've if they tinkered with that idea or not, but maybe that's okay because it doesn't matter if you see it
[40:23.720 --> 40:27.720]  Or not because by the time you go to do something on it, you are already moving your hands
[40:27.720 --> 40:33.720]  I don't write especially if you have to I mean if they acknowledge that you have to be looking at it to use it already
[40:33.720 --> 40:36.720]  And I just I feel like I don't know
[40:36.720 --> 40:41.720]  I I could see I think some people push back in that like with the notion of well what your palms could rest on and
[40:41.720 --> 40:42.720]  It could mess it up or something
[40:42.720 --> 40:51.720]  Obviously Apple has all the palm detection stuff for the iPad already. I'm sure they could figure that out. But I just think like for certain types of things
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.720]  Certainly some of the things that they were showing off like the DJing and all that kind of you know fun stuff
[40:56.720 --> 40:58.720]  You might not be you know
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.720]  Really needing to use the keyboard as much as sort of the touch area to toggle controls and stuff
[41:03.720 --> 41:06.720]  And so in that situation, it might make a little bit more sense, but I don't know
[41:06.720 --> 41:13.720]  I mean, I assume like you said they they maybe tried something or thought about it at least and they determined that that wasn't the way to go
[41:13.720 --> 41:15.720]  Yeah, I don't know
[41:15.720 --> 41:18.720]  What do you think about the weight and the size?
[41:18.720 --> 41:19.720]  The weight and the size are great
[41:19.720 --> 41:22.720]  I mean, it's not so I have
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.720]  Right now I have a bunch of machines
[41:25.720 --> 41:31.720]  I have a older MacBook Pro for that's my work machine that sort of was
[41:31.720 --> 41:33.720]  Given to me by the way
[41:33.720 --> 41:36.720]  People who dish out computers at work
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.720]  And so that's I think like a two and a half or three year old MacBook. So an older style MacBook Pro
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.720]  Then I have the MacBook the small 13 inch one
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.720]  And then I got the touch touch bar MacBook Pro
[41:49.720 --> 41:56.720]  And so my other issue there is that while it is obviously more svelte
[41:56.720 --> 41:59.720]  And lighter than the older MacBook Pro
[41:59.720 --> 42:05.720]  I have it's not, you know, anywhere near as light and as felt as the MacBook itself
[42:05.720 --> 42:11.720]  And so if I'm going somewhere where I would want sort of the most portability
[42:11.720 --> 42:14.720]  Obviously, I know that most people don't have three options, of course
[42:14.720 --> 42:17.720]  But when people would ask like, well, I just want the most portability
[42:17.720 --> 42:19.720]  I would say go with the MacBook
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.720]  I mean, it's it's still the main problem there now is the one
[42:23.720 --> 42:29.720]  USB-C port
[42:29.720 --> 42:33.720]  And honestly, you know, I carry around the dongle of course
[42:33.720 --> 42:36.720]  And it's mildly annoying from time to time
[42:36.720 --> 42:40.720]  But I'm not sure it would be even be that much better if it just if it had four USB-C ports
[42:40.720 --> 42:43.720]  Because USB-C is still not doesn't seem quite as ubiquitous
[42:43.720 --> 42:46.720]  Certainly for the things like I have to you know
[42:46.720 --> 42:49.720]  Loop in things for work all the time and sort of hook up different USB-C stuff
[42:49.720 --> 42:52.720]  And I almost always need a converter still
[42:52.720 --> 42:55.720]  So I'm just not sure that that would even sort of alleviate the pain
[42:55.720 --> 42:59.720]  So my biggest problem with the older MacBook and I have the one that's you know came out a couple years ago
[42:59.720 --> 43:01.720]  So it's it's fairly slow
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.720]  But I think a lot of people said that this sort of newer version that came out
[43:05.720 --> 43:08.720]  Several months ago is significantly faster
[43:08.720 --> 43:11.720]  So I would go with that one
[43:11.720 --> 43:19.720]  The thing I like the most about it and I think it speaks to your point that we're sort of approaching peak form factor is
[43:19.720 --> 43:26.720]  And it was the to me the part that made my my personal 2014 I think
[43:26.720 --> 43:30.720]  I get mixed up at how old a two-year-old I think I got it in 2014 anyway
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.720]  Yeah that makes sense my 2014 13 inch MacBook Pro the biggest difference to me
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.720]  And it's it's petty and it has nothing to do with actual computing
[43:40.720 --> 43:47.720]  But it's the ease with which I can open this the display that the display just lifts up perfectly
[43:47.720 --> 43:52.720]  And if I want to adjust it slightly I just put one finger on it on the new ones that is
[43:52.720 --> 43:58.720]  And yeah and it just it's just absolute the perfect amount of resistance where it never moves if I don't want it to
[43:58.720 --> 44:01.720]  And when I do want to move it it's the least amount of energy possible
[44:01.720 --> 44:05.720]  And it makes my old one feel like it's way too hard and heavy to lift
[44:05.720 --> 44:13.720]  And to me that's that's the that's the the ideal that the new MacBooks have ever more closely approached to
[44:13.720 --> 44:20.720]  I don't know about the the regular MacBook like when you lift a MacBook is it so light that the whole thing lifts up or can you do it with one hand?
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.720]  Yeah it's right I would say it's a little bit too light for that I still feel the need to sort of
[44:26.720 --> 44:29.720]  Yeah like you know weigh it down a little bit while I'm lifting it up
[44:29.720 --> 44:35.720]  Whereas the new MacBook Pros you don't have to do that the new MacBook Pros even though in theory it's it's worse to be heavier
[44:35.720 --> 44:41.720]  All things considered right they could make one that was every bit as fast and powerful as the MacBook
[44:41.720 --> 44:49.720]  Yes they would do it they're not going to make it heavier just the Apple is not going to make MacBooks heavier just just to make it easier to open them in the future
[44:49.720 --> 44:58.720]  But right now I feel like the MacBook Pros are at this wonderful ideal between the weight of the base where the keyboard and the battery and everything are
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.720]  And the lightness of the display and the ability to lift it up
[45:03.720 --> 45:16.720]  I agree and so right so the form factor is great right it's so great that it's like it's been whittled down to sort of this this you know that that level of sort of perfection for exactly what you're talking about
[45:16.720 --> 45:23.720]  What else would they possibly do to it beyond like you know expanding touch bar and doing other things to it but it's like that's the form factor
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.720]  There's what else are you gonna do to that you can't really change that now
[45:27.720 --> 45:38.720]  No other than you know and again it's not really a change of the form factor but in theory at some point I presume that they're going to you know it won't be aluminum forever
[45:38.720 --> 45:45.720]  I mean you know I feel like the MacBook still has a decade maybe more ahead of it
[45:45.720 --> 45:52.720]  Is it going to really be aluminum for 20 or 30 years I don't know but so new materials you know
[45:52.720 --> 46:00.720]  But basically I do think the form factor as you know for and for certain tasks it is a wonderful wonderful form factor
[46:00.720 --> 46:10.720]  And I just feel like don't mess with it and I do wonder there's a part of me that wonders if the touch bar is basically a mess with it for the sake of messing with it
[46:10.720 --> 46:20.720]  Right that's exactly what I was basically alluding to in that post you know they felt like look we're sort of at the perfect storm of two things right now right
[46:20.720 --> 46:26.720]  So what we were just talking about sort of the form factor is we've whittled it down to near perfection right
[46:26.720 --> 46:34.720]  And then on the flip side we have sort of the CPUs and the internals are basically not getting that much faster now
[46:34.720 --> 46:47.720]  Because you know Moore's Law has slowed down we're sort of at the point where it's very hard to rationalize a year to year upgrade
[46:47.720 --> 46:56.720]  It's hard to rationalize a two year to year upgrade right for a MacBook Pro because it's just not that much faster than what the state of the art was two years ago
[46:56.720 --> 47:07.720]  And so we have those two things coming into play and so when Apple's trying to think about well what do we do this year to get you know to get people excited about potentially buying the new machine
[47:07.720 --> 47:19.720]  You know you can do you can change the colors of it they've done that a little bit of course with some gold and rose gold options and I don't think that that really moves the needle though on making someone purchase a new one
[47:19.720 --> 47:31.720]  And so this touch bar thing it feels like to me that was you know some idea like let's try this you know let's see if this is interesting and that's a dangerous game for Apple to play I think
[47:31.720 --> 47:40.720]  I totally agree and I wonder about it and it is clearly to me their most important product I know we just had the whole thing with the Mac Pro and that there's iMacs coming out and stuff like that
[47:40.720 --> 47:52.720]  But the MacBooks are clearly the bread and butter of the Mac lineup you know if they had to cut back for some reason you know that's the last Macs to go are going to be the MacBooks
[47:52.720 --> 48:03.720]  And I wonder you and I have talked about this before and I know a lot of people obviously have different differing thoughts on this but like so the other part I think towards the end of that post I wrote was basically
[48:03.720 --> 48:16.720]  I'm very much in the camp of I would love to just do everything on an iPad I'm like 90 I'm 95 let's say percent of the way there the problem is that other 5% matters and so I just can't do it yet
[48:16.720 --> 48:32.720]  I would love to be in that camp though are you and I know you're definitely you know still in the MacBook camp but if they could do if they had full sort of parity maybe not you know not quite as easy to do certain things and vice versa
[48:32.720 --> 48:41.720]  But if they had sort of full parity in terms of functionality would you want to use an iPad more than you use the MacBook
[48:41.720 --> 48:56.720]  No I don't think so I think the longer time goes on the less likely I am to use to even want to use an iPad I feel like I have the clarity now and it might I feel like but I don't feel like I speak to the mass market
[48:56.720 --> 49:11.720]  It's I have so many little things little custom nerd scripts and things that I have set to keyboard shortcuts on my Mac that I can't do on the iPad and that even if I wanted to do through workflow or something like that
[49:11.720 --> 49:30.720]  And I'm super super happy that Apple bought workflow and seems to want to keep it around and maybe they'll integrate it in the OS but like I have a shortcut that is system wide service that I made so that I can convert the selected text in any app from markdown to HTML
[49:30.720 --> 49:49.720]  And the key command I made for it is command shift K I don't know why I forget why because M because command shift M is like minimize windows and so I went to K mark I don't know but I don't even have to think about I had to pause to remember it because my fingers just know it and I've had it for years
[49:49.720 --> 50:00.720]  Yeah but you know so the iPad pros like we were just talking about you know you can get the keyboard that's with it and they you know they have command and shift and K still
[50:00.720 --> 50:12.720]  I guess that in theory they could add that they could add stuff to the system software that would enable something like that in theory right but the form factor doesn't speak to me either like
[50:12.720 --> 50:36.720]  Last week when I was flying home from San Francisco after the shindig at Cupertino I was at the gate at the terminal and I had a couple just a couple minutes before they started boarding and somebody DMed me that I had a typo in a DF post
[50:36.720 --> 50:54.720]  And instead of fixing it on my phone I just I knew I had like a couple minutes I just quick took out my MacBook from my backpack opened it and just without even sitting down just held it in the palm of my hand and opened it logged in fixed it
[50:54.720 --> 51:06.720]  Shut it put it back my backpack like I don't see how you could do that on an iPad I you could do it but you wouldn't have the hardware keyboard there's no way you can just sit there and stand and connect the hardware keyboard and yeah I get that
[51:06.720 --> 51:21.720]  And I'm sort of the same way that's one of the sort of 5% thing is definitely on the writing side of things so I actually do a lot of writing on the iPad but I'll sort of write in the in the app Ulysses and then I basically export it to medium or wherever I'm going to publish
[51:21.720 --> 51:33.720]  And I don't publish though from there because I wait to do some of the formatting stuff that I can just I feel like I can just have a much better handle on using on a on a MacBook and so I wait to publish until after there
[51:33.720 --> 51:48.720]  But that's that's sort of one of the larger parts of the 5% that is still holding me back but in in my in my book I'm sort of I'm quite different, I guess from you in that regard because I like my ideal computing experience would be
[51:48.720 --> 52:06.720]  Where I could go on a trip not have to take any MacBook with me just take the the iPad Pro with the keyboard cover and you know I do it right now for short little trips or you know just on a daily basis like if I'm going to just do email or and then do some reading
[52:06.720 --> 52:18.720]  And I go to a sort of local cafe I just love grabbing that thing and walking out the door don't bring a bag. It's so it just, it just feels like this is the way I want to be doing computing in my life.
[52:18.720 --> 52:29.720]  And I don't want to have, you know, even as we were just talking about, even as felt as the MacBooks are now I just, there's, there's too much going on I like the simplicity of doing everything through the iPad.
[52:29.720 --> 52:44.720]  I totally see the appeal of it but it doesn't, it just doesn't speak to me. I, you know, and I like iPad. But for me and again I'm a big proponent. I have been for years, fighting against the argument that it's fundamentally only good for consumption and not for
[52:44.720 --> 52:59.720]  consumption. I've argued it, but for me personally that actually is very true that I tend to use it, I actually have left the cover of mine for a while now and I just have it with no cover and I read tons on it, and I read lots of Twitter, and I bookmark things
[52:59.720 --> 53:15.720]  during Fireball later from a different machine from it, but it's, I tend not to do any actual typing on it. But I can see the appeal, I totally see the appeal. And I would totally see the appeal for long form writing too. I feel like the longer the thing you're writing, the more, the more pleasant it is.
[53:15.720 --> 53:31.720]  And like when I wrote, like I did, I enjoyed writing my review of the iPad Pro on the iPad Pro because it was a long review. And I do kind of like that it is naturally distraction free. I find I never use the distraction free full screen modes on the Mac for any app ever,
[53:31.720 --> 53:45.720]  because I find that it's just, just gets in the way when I want to get out of it. Whereas on the iPad, it's totally natural. It's, you know, and I'm a big believer in that in general, I feel anything you tack on to a system afterwards is never as good as if it was there from the beginning.
[53:45.720 --> 53:59.720]  So full screen mode on the Mac to me, I use it for video and that's about it. But otherwise to me it feels tacked on because the Mac wasn't designed at the start, it was designed to have everything in Windows that are overlapping you can drag around.
[53:59.720 --> 54:03.720]  Whereas the iPad was designed from the ground up to have full screen apps.
[54:03.720 --> 54:20.720]  Yeah, and I mean, I, so I do a lot of, you know, anything that I write, basically, like you said, sort of that's, that's longer than just a blurb or something like that I try to do on the iPad. And I just it's something about it reminds me of like when I was a kid growing up going to my father's office and like they had typewriters and just using the typewriter, right?
[54:20.720 --> 54:30.720]  I mean, I know it's obviously very different, but something about this focus thing and it's almost like, you know, there's a there's a blank sheet of paper in front of you and the words are magically appearing on it.
[54:30.720 --> 54:46.720]  Yeah, and most things in my life, most things in my life are that I'm in control of are a complete mess. Like my desk is usually just a complete Andy Rooney style mess of papers and odd objects and boxes and all sorts of stuff.
[54:46.720 --> 54:57.720]  So, like lots of things I have are a complete mess. Other things, though, I try to keep obsessively neat and like the daring fireball homepage would be a fine example. There's no clutter.
[54:57.720 --> 55:10.720]  You know, I aspire to that. I wish that I had the organizational ability and the wherewithal to have everything in my life be like that. I when I see pictures of people who have these minimal offices, I covet them.
[55:10.720 --> 55:23.720]  I do. I see the appeal. And I do. I look at my Mac with all of these windows. Like if I go to expose or whatever and see how many apps I have running and how many windows are actually overlapping.
[55:23.720 --> 55:43.720]  Sometimes my Mac looks like a mess. And I do. I like the way that the iPad, even if you open a second app, I love how neat it is that if you have like a message, the messages app on the right in a narrow iPhone with column and your other thing, whether it's Safari or your writing app in a square to the left of it.
[55:43.720 --> 56:02.720]  I love how neatly that's organized where there's no overlap. There's no shadows from windows showing depth. It's just two rectangles perfectly aligned. I love that. And I can see how that is soothing, mentally soothing to people and appealing.
[56:02.720 --> 56:22.720]  Since it's sort of the perfect segue and there may not be much to talk about, but I'm just curious, like, so obviously Apple released the sort of, you know, the cheaper iPad version, but they didn't do anything, you know, as was rumored by many various sites for actual new iPad hardware.
[56:22.720 --> 56:32.720]  And so I presume now that we're at the end of April, we're not going to see any sort of event before WWDC. So do they do that at WWDC? Do they wait for the fall?
[56:32.720 --> 56:43.720]  I don't know. It's very intriguing to me that the supply chain rumor mill seemed to think it was going to happen, you know, like either last month or the first week of April or something like that.
[56:43.720 --> 56:56.720]  And I agree with you. I don't hear any rumblings to the ground that there's anything coming before WWDC. So I almost feel like it's something that maybe they've successfully kept under wraps.
[56:56.720 --> 57:06.720]  So it could happen at WWDC, but if they wait until the fall, I almost feel like they've got to wait till October because it sounds like...
[57:06.720 --> 57:07.720]  So after iPhone.
[57:07.720 --> 57:13.720]  Right, because I don't think they'd want to share the stage with iPhone because it sounds like they've got a very exciting iPhone to unveil.
[57:13.720 --> 57:21.720]  And if it's on schedule, it'll be like the second week of September, as I said before. I mean, they've been pretty consistent on that for three or four years.
[57:21.720 --> 57:38.720]  And I don't think they'd want to share the stage, but they could, in theory. It may come naturally if there's a shared design language of a more edge-to-edge display. It could make sense to unveil them side by side.
[57:38.720 --> 57:44.720]  I don't know, but it would make more sense to me if they did iPhones in September and iPads in October.
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.720]  But you don't think that they would do it at WWDC?
[57:48.720 --> 58:12.720]  I guess they could, but it depends how much these new iPads, which at least one of them is rumored to be a more edge-to-edge display, where the 9.7-inch iPad is still going to be 9.7 inches as a device, but that the screen will be 10-point-something inches instead of 9.7 inches because it's going to take up more of the front face.
[58:12.720 --> 58:16.720]  But that sounds to me like what the rumor is for the iPhone.
[58:16.720 --> 58:25.720]  And they don't want to spoil it, right? That they want the iPhone to come out first.
[58:25.720 --> 58:37.720]  But am I overthinking it? Am I overthinking their willingness to just let the product that's ready to ship first ship first, whether it's the iPhone or not? I don't know.
[58:37.720 --> 58:48.720]  Yeah, and if there was some sort of marquee feature in iOS 11 that was more iPad-focused, maybe.
[58:48.720 --> 58:57.720]  But there hadn't been much rumors about iOS 11 at all, even though we're fairly close, which is interesting.
[58:57.720 --> 59:20.720]  Well, other than the fact that for a while, I don't know if you've noticed this, but I've heard rumors for a while that months ago, I guess more or less when iOS 10 came out last WWDC, after the event was over, there were rumors beforehand that Apple might unveil some iPad-pro-specific features.
[59:20.720 --> 59:33.720]  And the keynote came and went and there were none. And then in the aftermath, the word was, well, that got punted from 10.0, but it's going to come in like 10.2 or something. 10.2 or 10.3.
[59:33.720 --> 59:43.720]  But we've gotten to 10.3 and it didn't happen. And there's not going to be a 10.4 between now and June because all hands are working on iOS 11.
[59:43.720 --> 59:55.720]  So whether that ships in iOS 11.0 or not, or gets punted once again to the first big update in December or January of 11.2, I don't know.
[59:55.720 --> 01:00:06.720]  But there have been rumors since this time last year that they have iPad-pro-specific improvements to the OS for multitasking and stuff like that.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:25.720]  And if that is the case, then we may have just answered our riddle, right, that they would launch that and presumably they would want to have new iPad-pro hardware to show whatever that functionality is off, since the iPad-pro would be relatively old at that point, right, over a year between iterations.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:31.720]  Right. Well, and the 12-inch one, the 13-inch one would be a year and a half old.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]  Yeah, really old.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:42.720]  Really old at this point. I don't know. But, I mean, both of them launched with, I feel, a lot of headroom to wait for the next version because they really are pretty fast for iPads.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.720]  I mean, they're both faster thanI don't know if they're faster than the current MacBook, but I think they are.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:54.720]  And they're certainly faster than the MacBook that you're talking about, the original MacBook with one port. I mean, that's how fast they are.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:10.720]  Yep, I'm using the big iPad-pro right now, which I almost never use. Again, speaking to, obviously, as we all do, we just buy a bunch of devices, probably more than we need, but it is nice when you're sort of sitting at a desk. It's a nice sort of second screen.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:33.720]  Yeah, I don't know. So I feel like they need to, though, and I feel like selling points on changes to the OS to make it a little bit morebring the iPad, especially the iPad-pro, a little bit more towards the Mac in terms of capabilities, not necessarily copying things from the Mac and how you do it, but just making it easier.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:44.720]  I mean, the thing I would like to see them dolet me take a break, actually. I mean, hold this thought, and I'll take a break because it's a good way to keep people in suspense.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:02:00.720]  I want to talk to you about our next sponsor. I love this company. I love their products, and this is a company thatI hate to say it, but they shouldn't even be paying me to promote their products because I would sing their praises even if they weren't, and that company is Eero.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:13.720]  E-E-R-O. Eero makes Wi-Fi routers for your house. You don't have to choose which one. They just have one model right now. You buy a three-pack. You plug one of them.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:22.720]  They're little white boxes, roughly the size of an Apple TV or something like that, that almost looks like an Apple-designed product. They ship with Apple-style, really supple.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  Even the Ethernet cables they give you in the box are nice. It's like a nice Ethernet cable. It's not like a piece of junk thing that you got from Joe's cables on the corner.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.720]  Nice cable, nice power cable. You plug it into your router, and now you've gotthere's your primary Eero base station.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:45.720]  Then you take the other two, and maybe your router is on the first floor. You put another one on the second floor and another one on the third floor.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:52.720]  Keep them near the steps. Try to minimize how many walls it has to go through, and it creates what's called a mesh network through your house.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  It is a huge difference. Now, I don't know whatmaybe if you live in a studio apartment, guess what? You don't really need an Eero.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  It's a nice base station, but you really only need one, and it'd be a nice base station for that, but the mesh network thing isn't going to help you out.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:21.720]  But if you live in a city like I do, we have four floors. There's really no way to set up one router that I've ever tried that gets a good Wi-Fi signal everywhere in the house.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  I personallyI just recently upgraded my Comcast service, had Comcast come in, got new Internet.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:41.720]  Comcast's new routerthey gave me a router with the thing. In the room where I have it set up in my home office, I get like 150, 200 megabits per second over Wi-Fi.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:48.720]  It's amazing. That's an amazing performance. It's like 10 times faster than what I had before. One floor up, still pretty good.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.720]  It's like 50 megabits per second, something like that. But in my master bedroomthis is no shit. I swear to God this is true.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.720]  I tested this with the speed test app. I get 0.2 megabits per second Wi-Fi from that router.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  So it goes from 200 megabits per second to 0.2 megabits per second.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  So once the Comcast guy was gone and I knew I had good Internet, I'd reset up my Eros. I put my Ero in there, and I only have three.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  Now I still get 200 or so megabits per second in my office from Ero, but my master bedroom is getting 60 megabits per second Wi-Fi.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:34.720]  That's how great it is. I cannot beand I didn't have to configure anything. You just follow the instructions in their little app, and it just configures everything.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:44.720]  And they even tell you that they talk to each other, and they fix it up, and after you've set it up, like 24 hours later, the service is usually even better
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.720]  because the Eros have communicated with each other about where they should hand off to each other.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:56.720]  Cannot tell you how happy I am with this product. I recommend it highly. I don't know what else to tell you.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.720]  If you need Wi-Fi, if you're unhappy with your Wi-Fi, if you need new Wi-Fi, you'd be silly not to check it out.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.720]  What they do is they recommend one Ero for every thousand square feet of your home.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  Three-pack's a good starting point. You can always buy more, and you can hook up ten in total if you need to.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:25.720]  So here's what you do. Go to ero.com and use the code. Actually, you know what? Forget the code. Screw it.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:33.720]  Here's what they've done. They've gotten rid of these codes, and to celebrate their first birthday, what they've done is they've just dropped their prices permanently.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:41.720]  So instead of using a code, you just go to ero.com, and now you can get a three-pack for just $399. It used to be $499.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  And you can get a two-pack for $299. That used to be $50 more.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:52.720]  So to get Eero at this new price, just go to ero.com, and you can get them at Best Buy or even Amazon if you want. They don't care.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:06:00.720]  They don't even care if you buy them direct. So if you need Wi-Fi, get an Eero. Love this product.
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:06.720]  I feel like you and I talked about Eero before they were a sponsor of your podcast, which is nice.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.720]  I remember the first time Iyou know what? I'll get back to the point I wanted to make about iPad. I've got my finger in the air. This is my reminder.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.720]  I know the point I want to make. But we could go on a digression right now.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:23.720]  I remember the first time I heard about Eero was I read it in Walt Mossberg's column.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:29.720]  And I read his description of it, and I knew that I was suffering from the problem that he was talking about.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:39.720]  For years, I had an Apple, AirPort, whatever, the best Appleand I think it's still the most recent one, because they haven't updated it in years.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720]  The one that's
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720]  AirPort Extreme.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  Yeah, the one that's real tall.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.720]  Yeah, I have the same one. I had the same one. Now I have Eero. Same thing.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:53.720]  I had it on the second floor, our living room, of a four-floor residence. And it was okay.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:07:01.720]  And my office was one floor up, and it got pretty good Wi-Fi. Our master bedroom on the fourth floor, eh, it wasn't bad.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:09.720]  It wasn't like it was with this Comcast router. But it wasn't great.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.720]  And for whatever reason, our garage on the first floor, one floor down, got no signal whatsoever.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  I don't know if it's because the garage had insulation. I don't know what the heck it was.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.720]  I read Walt's column, and I was like, this sounds amazing, because A, it solves a problem I have.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:33.720]  But B, he's telling me that I don't have to configure. There's noyou don't go into an admin interface and start typing in IP numbers.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  You don't start picking channels. You don't have to set one of them in bridge mode and one of them in something mode.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.720]  You just hook them up and tap buttons in the app as you hook them up around your house and follow their general advice of where best to put them.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  And then all of a sudden, you've got a network that every room in your house has good internet.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:59.720]  I was like, that sounds so amazing. And it was the literal truth. It's the exact experience of using it.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:04.720]  And anyway, the digression would be Walt's announcement that he's retiring.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:14.720]  Yeah, obviously significant news within the world in which we inhabit.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:27.720]  It's funny, when I moved to goso I was working as a web developer down in San Diego and sort of writing on the side just for fun.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  And at some point, VentureBeat at the time came calling and wanted me to come up and consider writing full time.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:44.720]  And I just sort of laughed to myself, thinking no one can make a living doing that.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.720]  It's almost too good to be true.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:59.720]  And around the same time, I think there had been a profile, or maybe I was even just Googling it, but the story of the rise of Walt Mossberg getting into
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720]  Obviously, it wasn't blogging at the time. It was for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.720]  But sort of making his way into this thing that hadn't existed before.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:14.720]  He was covering politics, and then all of a sudden he decided he was going to cover personal technology.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:25.720]  And again, not blogging exactly, but not too dissimilar from the ideal state for a lot of us, certainly for me at the time.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.720]  That's what I aspired to do, something like that.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.720]  I just readI will, I swear to God, put it in the show notes.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:43.720]  There's an interviewI think it just came out today, but if not, it came out last nightan interview with Walt in the Columbia Journalism Review.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.720]  Right. I haven't read it yet, but I saved it as well.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:10:01.720]  At 1991, he was the lead national security correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, which the Columbia Journalism Review says is literally one of the most coveted spots in all of newspaper journalism.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:16.720]  I mean, you could count it on one hand as one of the most prestigious gigs. The Journal, the New York Times, Washington Post, and a handful of the top jobs there would be something like that.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:27.720]  Because national security is of utmost importance, and when something breaks, it becomesyou own the top right corner of the front page of the newspaper.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.720]  No breaking news is more important than national security news.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  Right.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:46.720]  So he had the job. He obviously had decades ahead of him in his career, and he gave it up to create what was then unheard of, which was in a national major newspaper, a personal technology column.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  Everybodylike the CGR said that most people in the industry, news people, were like, what did he do? Why did he get this terrible demotion?
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:01.720]  Right. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what the equivalent thing would be today.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:11.720]  And it's hard to come up with something because honestly, it's hard to envision something that would sort of become as pervasive as just technology in general, right?
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:19.720]  Like you could say, oh, I'm going to stop the Apple beat because I want to write about Bitcoin.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:27.720]  And people would be like, but you're covering the most valuable company in the world. Why do you want to write about sort of this nascent technology thing?
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.720]  And it was one hell of a leap of faith that he did.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:41.720]  And obviously, like I said, he sort of was the pinnacle of doing that.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  And I think the whole generations of Engadgets, Gizmodos, all the people who were doing gadget reviews, certainly, that was the pinnacle.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.720]  And then just in general, sort of writing a technology column.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.720]  I can't say it better than him. Here's Walt's exact words in this interview.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:09.720]  There were a bunch of computer columns in a lot of other newspapers, and certainly there were computer magazines, but these were all written by geeks for geeks.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.720]  My pitch to the journal was that I wanted to write a column that didn't use a lot of jargon, that treated people with respect for their intelligence.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:26.720]  And I think that can not be understated that that was the gist of Walt's, it still is the gist of Walt's writing, that it was never computers for dummies.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:35.720]  It was, his angle was that the problem was with the complicated stuff, not with the people who can't understand the complicated stuff.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:49.720]  And that it did two things. One, helped people figure out how to make this journey into technology by telling them what was good and what was bad on the market, explaining when some new development happened, what it meant, what it was, who it might be for.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:13:03.720]  That was one of my goals. And the other one was to use the power of the platform and the voice that I would have in this column, because it was an opinion column in a way, to push the industry to stop ignoring normal people and stop treating them like they were stupid.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.720]  That was it. That was my idea and it worked. And I can't say it better than that. I cannot say it better than that.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:31.720]  No, that's absolutely perfect, because he sort of, he basically, whether you could argue, you know, he helped, certainly helped usher that era in, but he also just, he foresaw the fact that it would move from, you know, sort of the enthusiasts and geeky people just being really into technology and, you know, reading things like PC World and things like that, to actually going into a mainstream thing.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  And like, I mean, it is, you know, one of the most mainstream things right now is technology, right? Like there's every single person in the world in some capacity uses some sort of technology.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:57.720]  And could you imagine sort of if, you know, if the PC worlds were still sort of the norm and sort of writing about that, it would seem insane right now, because no one would have sort of a guide to figure out how to use any of this stuff.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:10.720]  And the timing is just amazing that he did it and he made this decision in 1991, because in my opinion, what made computers mainstream, arguably twofold, but I think it's single fold.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:26.720]  I think Windows 95 obviously had some part of it where the mass market, lower cost PCs jumped from having a really janky operating system like Windows 3.1 to having something that looked pretty nice and was a little, certainly a lot better organized.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:33.720]  But the bigger thing is just the internet itself, which is that, and you know, people who love computers, I certainly didn't foresee it.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:42.720]  I, you know, I was of the opinion as somebody, a kid who grew up loving computers, I couldn't understand why everybody else didn't love computers and want to spend as many hours a day as they possibly could on computers.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  But for normal people, what made computers something that they didn't care about, something they cared about deeply was that they got turned into communication devices.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:58.720]  It's communication. Everything, you know, humans are creatures as we're born to want to communicate with each other.
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:04.720]  And the technologies that allow us to do so are the ones that rocket off.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  I mean, you could even talk about the automobile from the Henry Ford era a century ago as ultimately as a communications device, you know, that, yes, you could use it to bring things from one place to another faster than you could.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:24.720]  But the fact that you could go visit people who you otherwise couldn't visit because you wouldn't have time to get there is a huge part of it, right?
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:35.720]  And computers before they were communication devices or in like the dial-up modem era when you had to dial in and telnet into a bulletin board and use, you know, cryptic command line things and nobody would understand it.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:41.720]  Like, geeks got it early. We spent time on bulletin boards communicating with each other.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:48.720]  When simple, easy to understand communication technology became available on the Internet, that's when it exploded.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:57.720]  But Walt had his column from 1991, five years before that. And so he was already established as this voice of authority when the explosion already happened.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:04.720]  Yeah. And I mean, the most obvious thing in the world is that the iPhone was the ultimate extrapolation of that, right?
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  Because then you had not only was it a physical communication device, it blended everything together and you had it with you all the time.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:29.720]  Right. One thing that I was curious to your take about this topic on with, you know, with Walt moving on was who do you think takes up the mantle then as sort of the I guess that go to either technology columnist or reviewer?
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:38.720]  You know, we know the names who are sort of at the at the bigger places, you know, Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:52.720]  Wall Street Journal is still doing the combo, right? With Joanna and the other guy.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:17:02.720]  But so what and then David Pogue, I, you know, is still at Yahoo, I guess, or is he not? I don't even know, like, what's going to happen? Is he going to be at?
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:07.720]  I think so, but I feel like I don't know, because Yahoo's future is so uncertain.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:13.720]  Right. Is he going to be at Ethos or whatever the hell that company is going to be called?
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.720]  So, oh, Jeffrey Fowler.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.720]  Yes, Jeffrey Fowler. Sorry, Jeffrey.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:26.720]  Sorry, Jeffrey. But so like, so how do you think that that plays out? Or is it not one of the giant, you know, sort of old school publications?
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:35.720]  Is it some some other is it so Mark Gurman, you know, was announced this morning that Bloomberg's launching a like a gadget show with with Gurman?
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:44.720]  Yeah, it was unlike Axios. So Axios, you know, the new the new newsletter thing from Mike Allen and that group.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.720]  Yeah, they broke the story about it looks like it's going I don't know exactly what it's going to be called.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.720]  Hold on. I actually had the link here, so I got it up, but.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:01.720]  Yeah, I was just talking about Axios because Ina Fried is took over and is running the technology beat for them.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.720]  And she was at the Appleschindig last week and I was talking to her about it.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:13.720]  It's an interesting format. And I said to her, I said, you know, I'm not just saying this because you're here, but I have to say that especially politics wise.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.720]  You know, I'm more keenly attuned ever, ever since November.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:24.720]  And in the last few months, it's surprising how many of the links that have bubbled up to the surface politically have been Axios sites.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.720]  Like it didn't take very long after Axios launched before I noticed it.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.720]  And I was like, how long has this been around? Because all of a sudden this is in my it's popping up every day.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.720]  And then I checked and I was like, oh, it's only like two weeks old.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.720]  Yeah, it's not like I missed it.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.720]  It's like right from the get go, though.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:46.720]  They've been they're doing great. And not not to do too much of an aside on the aside, but yeah.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:56.720]  So, you know, in my world, in my current world, in VC, obviously everyone was reading Dan Primack when he was at Fortune, his newsletter, and he moved over to Axios sort of around the time of their launch.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:03.720]  And then they have the Mike Allen guy who famously sort of wrote the, you know, the Politico newsletter for a long time.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.720]  And it's insane because he literally writes it every single day and just fills it with a ton of content every single day.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.720]  It seems to get legitimate inside the White House scoops.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.720]  And obviously, Primack gets his scoops.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.720]  You know, we'll get hers. And it's just like on down the line.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.720]  They have a they have a pretty killer product and team.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:26.720]  Yeah. Yeah. They really it's they did a very keen job of focusing on just getting great talent.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.720]  Just, you know, they have a great format. And I like you know, it's a good it looks good.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.720]  There's not I don't see any clutter on screen that is annoying me.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:42.720]  It's they've got this focus on writing really short articles that just get to the point which I think goes over really well.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:50.720]  Like there's no padding in the articles, but they've got great talent on all these beats, which is to me a great combination.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.720]  It's a good format with a good focus. It's user friendly.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.720]  And they've assembled a really good team of talented people with with deep sources.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.720]  So anyway, and they do a great and just they do a great job with brevity, too.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.720]  It's like they don't just they don't drag on. That's what I'm saying.
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.720]  There's so much on the web that drags on because it's like they want now.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:20.720]  It's like I feel like in the old days, the problem, like eight, nine years ago, was that the sites, because they were counting pages, they would break up.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:25.720]  They would break up articles, you know, click here for next page, next page.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:38.720]  But now I feel like articles are padded for the sake of being able to algorithmically interrupt between paragraphs to insert either ads or promotions for other thing on the site.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.720]  And so I know mostly reading on the phone is it.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.720]  There was this. Oh, my God, I forget who it was. I don't want to mention it because I don't want to give them any attention.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:59.720]  But there was an article I was reading last night where they had three interruptions in the same article to promote a new podcast that they were launching for the same podcast, three times in the article between paragraphs.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:05.720]  And on the phone, it's a huge it's a huge interruption between like where your eyes find the next paragraph.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.720]  Right. Anyway, Axios does a good job on that.
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:10.720]  So Gurman Singh is called Gadgets with Gurman.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.720]  That's a great idea.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.720]  Bloomberg show.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.720]  So it's going to be a digital video series that they're going to launch across all the Bloomberg stuff, including the terminal, it sounds like.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:24.720]  But then they're going to package it together and eventually sort of put it on Bloomberg Television as well.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.720]  I know he's been very interesting.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.720]  I know that's you know, I can't say I'm close friends with them, but I certainly am friendly with them.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:38.720]  He's been on the show and whenever, you know, I like now that now that he's, you know, really gone pro, he's he's getting invited to Apple events.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:48.720]  And I always try to make make a point of saying I know from talking to him that a big reason he went to Bloomberg instead of anywhere else was the promise of video and TV stuff.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.720]  You know, he's right. He's super interested in that.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:54.720]  So I'm not surprised at all that he's getting his own thing.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:06.720]  But so, you know, amongst those people or someone else, like, is there someone who takes up that mantle or are we just in an era now where it's so it's such the norm that there's going to be sort of the, you know, five to 10 go to.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.720]  I don't think there's anybody who takes the mantle from Mossberg. I really don't.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:23.720]  And and I just don't I just don't see how it happens because I don't see it's not like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal aren't still important, but they're differently important.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:33.720]  Now, where I don't feel like they have singular voice, maybe like on the New York Times op-ed page, you know, like Paul Krugman and Maureen Dowd still have that influence.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:50.720]  But I don't know. In technology, I just don't see it. I just I think the fact that Walt was there so early and was so established that it combined with the incredible power of the Wall Street Journal, even today.
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:56.720]  I mean, Wall Street Journal is still super popular, but the fact that he was doing it at the Journal, I just don't see how anybody's going to take that position.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:59.720]  It's almost like, you know, Michael Jordan retires. Who takes over as Michael Jordan?
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:04.720]  Like maybe there will be a Lebron who comes along, but I think whoever that is isn't here yet.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:08.720]  Yeah. And it's going to have to be sort of different thing, maybe even a different format.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.720]  And, you know, maybe this this German thing becomes interesting.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:21.720]  I do think, like, you know, some of some of the other other folks who have great history, like Steven Levy is a good, good friend of mine.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:27.720]  Obviously, he's still getting some amazing stories for for his back channel stuff, which is under wired now.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:36.720]  And, you know, there's so there's going to be sort of there's still the the group of folks who have so much prestige around them.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.720]  And the bigger companies are still comfortable sort of, you know, talking to them versus, you know, just some some random person.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:51.720]  Like you said, like sort of when when Mark was at when Mark Gurman was at a nine to five Mac, he didn't get invited to any of the Apple things.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.720]  Right. Even though he's breaking every single story.
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.720]  Well, it was already too late to come to the event. Right. Like what he was doing.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:06.720]  That was that was that was adding adding to the overall quantity of the information in the world had nothing to do with what was at the events.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.720]  It was, you know, five months before the event. Right.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:20.720]  I feel like the closest would be and I wonder, I think he did the right thing because I think part of being prescient with Walt was that.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:27.720]  I think he was I think he was smart to go to create the all things dbrand while at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.720]  And the again, the Columbia Journalism Review mentions that they did that.
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:40.720]  He and Kara Swisher did that when the consensus among print journalists was still to treat the Web as an ugly stepchild.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.720]  Right. Right. You're writing primarily for print.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:53.720]  And then there's some B team that takes the print stuff after it after it's gone through the print process and put it on the Web thing, whatever, you know, treat it as an ugly stepchild.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.720]  I mean, here in Philadelphia, I don't want to go on a super long side, but in Philadelphia, the two newspapers are the Inquirer and the Daily News.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:08.720]  And they made a decision in the late 90s that rather than focus on having like an Inquirer dot com and Philly,
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.720]  Daily News dot com or whatever you want to call the domains be a quality things.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:22.720]  They made like a joint thing called Philly dot com and they had content from both newspapers, but they just sort of it was never really clear which articles were from which paper,
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.720]  even though they independently as print operations, they were completely separate and rivals,
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.720]  completely separate rivals, even though they were under the same parent obligation, our organization.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:41.720]  But the Philly dot com and it was an ugly website. It was slow to load. They they always they were at the forefront of using paywalls
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.720]  and it almost bankrupted the color. It did bankrupt the company.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:51.720]  The company is you know, they ended up having to sell their their magnificent headquarters and and move into, you know,
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.720]  janky office space and it, you know, not treating the Web seriously, really almost random into the ground.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:04.720]  I would say Walt was at the opposite where Walt was, you know, with all things D, they they were like, we'll make you know, we'll write for the Web first.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.720]  Yep. And we'll make Web only content. That plus the conference business.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.720]  I mean, right. You know, they which came first curve. Right. That was 2003.
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:24.720]  And I think they started the all things D website in 2007. I also think that, you know, leaving leaving the journal for the last, you know, what, five, six years of his career to start Recode,
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:31.720]  which they then merged with, you know, Vox and the Verge, et cetera, was probably the right thing to do.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:39.720]  I really do think so. And I think it was had an eye on the future. But I wonder how much it lessened his influence.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:47.720]  Like, yeah, like I think really, I think for Kara and what she does best with breaking scoops, it's fine.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.720]  I think, in fact, it's I don't think I think it was all win.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:57.720]  And the fact that she's got equity in the thing and the scoops go out to everybody who cares about scoops when they come out.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:03.720]  But for Mossberg's thing of being a sort of spokesperson for the every man.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:12.720]  Right. As a product reviewer, I do wonder whether his his voice was lessened by leaving the journal.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:22.720]  Right. And I mean, that's that's the hard the hard sort of gap to close, because the every man may not read the Wall Street Journal only,
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.720]  but like they know of the Wall Street Journal. The every man knows the Wall Street Journal.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:29.720]  They'll know Walt Mossberg at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.720]  And certainly he had a big enough name for when he leaves the Wall Street Journal to take some of that audience with him.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:41.720]  But it will never be the full audience of, you know, a nationwide distributed paper.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:51.720]  And so. Right. I it was almost like was recode more of a, you know, sort of back to the tech enthusiast crowd versus the every man.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.720]  Right. Like Walt's writing never didn't change. Like. Right.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:03.720]  You know, I don't think that you could Pepsi challenge the difference between Walt's columns under the Recode or Verge banner and his Verge columns under the Journal banner.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.720]  He had the same style and the same approach and the same attitude. If you just look at the words.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.720]  But I think it reached fewer people. I think it was almost like a magnifier where he built the Walt Mossberg brand,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:19.720]  where if you put a quote up in a keynote and just had a quote from Walt Mossberg, that says a lot right there.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.720]  But Walt Mossberg, comma, the Wall Street Journal is like it's like a multiplier,
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:31.720]  because now you've got both the power of the Wall Street Journal brand combined, you know, multiplied by the power of Walt's personal brand.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  Yeah. And so, I mean, that speaks to why it was probably the smart move to then do the sort of the Vox sale and merge basically, you know, with the Verge,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:46.720]  because it is well, you know, we can argue about whether it's been successful yet in doing so.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:54.720]  It is trying to reach a more mainstream audience rather than, you know, what I think what Recode was doing itself, which was much more targeted.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:05.720]  Right. And, you know, obviously, I'm a surprise, surprise, I'm a big proponent of writers and independent journalists going off on their own and building their own brands.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:11.720]  But I'm also keenly aware of the brand equity of things like the Journal and the New York Times.
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  I feel like Pogue is in the same boat where career rise, it might have been exactly the right thing.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:20.720]  I'm not criticizing him in the least. It might have been exactly the right thing to go to Yahoo.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.720]  And, you know, it might be great for his career and his family and his personal finances.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.720]  But I can't help but think that if Pogue were still at the New York Times, he might be in that position to sort of take over as the de facto.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:41.720]  Like David Pogue at the New York Times is a much more powerful voice and brand than David Pogue at Yahoo tech or whatever the umbrella is.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:51.720]  Yeah, it's sort of interesting. I know it's not a direct analogy and it's in some ways probably unfair, but it's like, you know, reminds me of sort of like the Siskel and Ebert thing, right?
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:30:00.720]  When they were at sort of the pinnacle of doing film reviews and, of course, the getting the television show and everything doing that.
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.720]  And then, you know, both unfortunately passed away.
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:12.720]  And like who then takes up that mantle? And they're really, you know, there's some people like A.O. Scott at the New York Times, who I think is great.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.720]  And there's a handful of other people, but no one has that same influence.
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.720]  That's a perfect example that I think because there is no there's no no more Siskel and Ebert.
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.720]  And even after Gene Siskel died, I think Ebert Ebert was enough of a voice where he was still.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:29.720]  Yes, he was still upright.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.720]  But after after he died, nobody really took that.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.720]  I can't think of who I would think, you know, I personally do like A.O. Scott.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.720]  I personally I love to hate read.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.720]  What's his name? Anthony Lane and the New Yorker. Oh, right.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:51.720]  Yep. Yep. I read those, too. Yep.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:58.720]  I get to the end of every issue of the New Yorker and I either if I see I don't read them unless I've seen the movie.
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.720]  But sometimes I keep all the ones and I bookmark them. And then when I do see the movie, I go back and I do the same exact thing.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.720]  I can read Anthony Lane's review and I do the exact same thing for the same reason.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:17.720]  I rip it up and I want to I want to just throw these ripped up reviews in his face and say, you joyless.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:22.720]  Don't you realize that sometimes the movie is just meant to be fun?
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.720]  But he's very good at writing those reviews. So I still read them.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.720]  But I can't say that like anybody is like that, like Ebert. I would say that.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.720]  Yeah. Walt is sort of the Ebert and Cisco combined, maybe. Anyway.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.720]  Yeah. Anyway, good luck. It's gonna be weird. It's gonna be weird not seeing him around.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:46.720]  I tell you that. Yeah. Are you going to I'll be at the the code conference for I guess that's where he's saying the the the actual goodbye.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.720]  So that'll be an interesting. I've never gone. I should see if I can wrangle it.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:58.720]  It is, you know, not to not to promote that to be a promotion here, but it is a very good conference.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:04.720]  They do a very good job with it. I think the reason I never have even thought about seeing if I could go is that it seems so close to WWDC.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.720]  And I'm sort of a homebody and I don't want to go away two times in short.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.720]  Yeah. And it's in Southern California. Not not up here. So. Right. Well, I don't really care.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.720]  It's just it's all that matters to me is that I'm a gazillion thousand miles away from home.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.720]  But can't be away from that U-Haul desk.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.720]  So you want to do you want to go back to your iPad? Well, let me finish this.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.720]  I have one more sponsor to thank. And then I'll go back to my iPad point, which is perfect.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:37.720]  And it's our good friends. One of our best sponsors, Fracture. Fracture is a photo decor company.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.720]  Here's what they do. You send them your personal photos. You pick a size and they have all sorts of sizes to pick from.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.720]  And then they print your photos directly on glass. You've probably heard about them before.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:52.720]  You've probably heard me talk about them. They've been a longtime sponsor. I cannot emphasize what a great gift this item is.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.720]  Now, as we record, it's the middle of April. Mother's Day is coming up.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.720]  I don't know if there's time left. Maybe as you hear me listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:09.720]  You can hurry up and order some fractures for Mother's Day. If not, order them for Father's Day.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:16.720]  These are the greatest gifts of all time that I've given them out to members on both sides of our family.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:24.720]  And every single time, even to people we've given them to before. Do you ever give a gift and then you're like, wow.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:28.720]  And it was great. It was well received. And you're like, wow, I wish I could give them the same gift again next year.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:37.720]  Guess what? With Fracture, you can. You can just pick new photos of kids who are growing up or trips that you've been on or anything that's happened in the last year.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:43.720]  It's a great gift. And you can give it to them again and again and again. And it goes over well each time.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:50.720]  And they don't think. The reaction is never, oh, one of these again. The reaction is always, oh my God, that's beautiful. Thank you so much.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.720]  Great photos printed directly on class. They do it right down in Gainesville, Florida. They're made in the USA.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:00.720]  And if you've never seen one in person, I just can't say how cool it is to have an edge-to-edge photo.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.720]  No bezel. It just goes right from one edge to another. And it comes with all the stuff you need to mount it on a wall.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:19.720]  And it just looks so striking to have a really high-quality photo that looks like it's printed directly on glass on the wall with no frame, no bezel, just edge-to-edge glass that is pure photo.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:25.720]  It's a great, great gift. It's a great product for your own home if you've got walls to fill and decorate.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:36.720]  Where do you go? Go to fractureme.com slash podcast. Now, that sounds like a fill-in URL that I'm botching.

[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:56.720]  That's where you can say The Talk Show or Daring Fireball or whatever you want to say, and they'll know you came from here.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.720]  So my thanks to that. Go ahead and buy them. They're the greatest gift you'll ever have.

[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.720]  All right, back to the iPad. Here's the thing I would like to see them do.
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:19.720]  My biggest request would be to have a multitasking mode similar to the one they have now, where you arrange multiple apps in full height columns.
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:28.720]  I would like to be able to make them, I don't know exactly, I haven't envisioned or invented an interface to make this, to figure out exactly how they would do it.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:35.720]  But I would like to have it be more arbitrary. So if you want to have three, you could have three.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:48.720]  If you want to drag one from the middle to the left, you could somehow drag the, you know, put your finger in like the nav bar or something, or do a long press on it and drag it over, rearrange them.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:36:07.720]  And I would like them to do away with, it bothers me somehow, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just feels like the whole thing, it still makes the whole thing feel tacked on to me, that the left one is always main and the right one is like the junior app.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:21.720]  And it doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't feel, it's like on the Mac, there's never, there's a front most window and then there's all other windows and they're all equal and if you click on one, it becomes front most and it's every bit as legit as the other ones.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:34.720]  So if I have three apps on my iPad in columns side by side, when I'm in the middle one, I feel like it should be every bit the real, the main app as it would be if it were the left one.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.720]  And secondarily, I would like them to figure out a way to more visually clarify which one currently has the focus.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:52.720]  Right, right. But so with that three, the notion of three, does that work ratio wise for sort of the, you know, how big?
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:10.720]  Yeah, because I think that if you do the size classes right, it could be it, your app should rearrange themselves, you know, should use using auto layout, etc, to any arbitrary width, you shouldn't be worried about exact whether it's exactly, you know, 767 pixels, or I got that wrong.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:21.720]  But you know, that you shouldn't be worried about hitting this short list of exact pixel widths, you should be more like a Mac app, you should be able to rearrange to any arbitrary width.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:29.720]  And I'm not saying that the that the iPad should let you drag the little divider and change it from 750 pixels to 748 pixels.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:38.720]  I feel like the fact that the iPad isn't so fussy, and has these set sizes that it that the apps clip to is actually nice.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:50.720]  Yeah, right. Like it's, it's always bothered me a little that you that when you resize a Mac app window, that it's never really perfect. It's always just where, you know, whichever, wherever you left off the mouse.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:38:01.720]  Right. So you want you want a combination of those things, like it just it being strict in sort of formatting, but just being more options for what you write, how you can format that.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  And I don't want infinite options. I feel like, you know, like a 9.7 inch iPad, maybe the maximum is three, maybe on the 12.9 the maximum is four.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:21.720]  You know, I trust Apple to work that out. But if I want to go 50-50, and I want to have two that are exactly 50-50, or if I want to go like two thirds, one third, I could do that very easily.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.720]  And if I want to go one third, one third, one third for three, I could do that easily.
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:36.720]  And do you do you think now I assume the iPad, certainly the iPad Pro is at the point where it could run three apps simultaneously without an issue?
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:46.720]  Oh, I think so. Without question. And especially with the way that, yeah, I think so. I think it has enough RAM to do that.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:39:01.720]  Yeah, I would love to see something like that. I think, you know, one of the biggest drawbacks, it's not huge, but one that I have, because I use the iPad a ton, is just there's still a little cutesy with sort of switching between the apps.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:09.720]  You know, they still have sort of these, the animations that go on to sort of, you know, flip it around and whatnot. And it just makes it a little bit longer than it needs to be, right?
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:17.720]  And so if you're really into like using two apps, yeah, and I know you could do this side by side things, and I do that for certain apps, it makes sense to do that for.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.720]  But I would even just like it, just make it as fast as possible to switch between two.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:25.720]  Yeah, they tweaked that in iOS 10.3.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.720]  Yeah, I think it's a little bit faster.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.720]  Yeah, they shortened some of the animation times.
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:37.720]  Yeah, like I'm using it right now. Yeah, I mean, it is faster because it slides right in now. But they still, you know, they're still cute, a little cutesy with the animations.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:54.720]  Yeah, and the longer you use a computer, like the more that you use an iPad as like your main writing computer, the more those animations grate on you, because the more sensitive you are to knowing that you're waiting for the animation and not really waiting for the computer.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.720]  Totally.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:09.720]  And I feel like in the classic days, like in the original Mac, like the 84, 85, 86, when the first Macs first came out, and you know, in hindsight, they were desperately, desperately slow and desperately starved for every resource you can imagine.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:14.720]  Disk space and RAM and video RAM and everything.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:27.720]  When you double clicked something, and you got those resume rectangles that showed it coming up, part of it was to help you understand, okay, you've opened this folder, and it's opening into a window and the animation would help you do that.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:36.720]  But the other reason the animations were there was to give you something to look at while you were waiting for the computer to actually do it because it wasn't going to happen instantaneously anyway.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:46.720]  It was sort of solving two birds with one stone, which was, it was giving you this visual clue of telling you what was happening, like, oh, this folder is opened into a window now.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.720]  And when I close the window, it closes into the icon from which it opened.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.720]  I see the folder is a window and the window is a folder.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:02.720]  And the folder, if I go back to that window, has a different visual state when the window, its corresponding window is open.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.720]  But the animations never felt like they were slowing you down because you were waiting for the computer anyway.
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:22.720]  And as the computers got faster, I feel like those visual clues, like I still like, in some ways, like on the iPad or iPhone, when you tap an icon and the app animates as it opens up, I still feel like it's, I don't feel like it should, I don't feel like the screen should flash instantly.
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.720]  But I feel like that animation should be very fast.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:38.720]  Right. And just playing around with it now, like, so I think Apple did a good job, sort of, if you use Command Tab, which you can use if you have the keyboard, you know, hooked up to the iPad, it's actually very fast.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:48.720]  It's pretty good. But if you just do the double click of the home button, it's still sort of like a slowish zoom out, and then you click on the one you want, and then it's a slowish zoom in.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:59.720]  And then the worst of all, maybe, and I don't know, I assume very few people actually use this, but you know, you can do the four finger sort of swipe thing and go from sort of app to app that way.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:02.720]  And it's just like unnecessarily slow.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:08.720]  So yeah, I almost never use that as a result of that. But that's currently, I guess, the state of the art.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.720]  The only other thing I was going to add to the iPad discussion, since we were talking about sort of newer ones.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:23.720]  So the Pro that I'm using now still feels super fast, the newer 9.7 Pro super fast, but I will say the iPad Mini is a little slow these days.
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:32.720]  I still use it for, you know, for certain times reading, take it out with me since it's nice and small, but that's pretty slow.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:38.720]  And I know that there was some debate back and forth whether or not they would actually just sort of get rid of that product.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.720]  And I hope they don't. But anyway.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:49.720]  I wonder because it does stick out now because it's actually at an entry level, it's more expensive than the new 9.7.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:56.720]  It does have more storage, so it's not completely inexplicable why it's more expensive.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:02.720]  But it does seem weird because up until this most recent introduction of the quote new 9.7 inch iPad,
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:10.720]  there was a correlation in cost between, okay, the small one is the cheapest, the mid-sized one is mid-priced, and the new big one is the most expensive.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:16.720]  And now all of a sudden there's a weird situation where if you're budget conscious, you're going to get the 9.7 inch,
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:24.720]  not the, you know, you're seemingly getting more of a device than you are, you know, for $329 than you would at $399 for the Mini.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:28.720]  And it's also, it's been over two years, right, since it's been updated at this point.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.720]  Yeah. I don't know if it's done, though. I don't know. I mean, it's hard to say. I don't know.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:39.720]  I guess it really comes down to how many people are buying it. I mean, Apple knows that and isn't going to tell us.
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.720]  But I wouldn't be surprised either way. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a very quiet update,
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:52.720]  more or less like with the specs of the quote new 9.7 inch iPad, just in the smaller size, and it just sits there.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.720]  I mean, I don't know. Who knows if they could lower the price, but, you know, maybe.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.720]  And I would be surprised if it just never gets updated and two years from now it just goes away.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:08.720]  That it sort of got killed by the plus sized iPhones.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:15.720]  Right. And yeah, especially if, you know, when the, if and when this new top of the line iPhone comes out,
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.720]  if that even makes it even more of sort of a glaring discrepancy between them.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.720]  And I wonder, I can't help but think that the pro uses, like I don't think there's ever going to be an iPad mini pro.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.720]  I just don't. I don't think they're going to make a keyboard that small. I think it would be would really take child.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:36.720]  I did get one of those keyboards that was like the Logitech one that you could use with it.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.720]  It was so ridiculously small. Not very useful.
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:46.720]  It is good, though, as a like a reader, you know, like it because it is.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:51.720]  And so if you really do just read, but maybe their thinking is that for the people who do use it, they mostly just read.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.720]  And it doesn't matter if it's long in the tooth and a little slow at this point. I don't know. Yeah.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:03.720]  But I can't see him adding a smart connector and having a keyboard for it.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:09.720]  Yeah, just it. It's too small of a screen size to actually make an ergonomic keyboard.
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:14.720]  And all you have to do is play with Logitech one for five seconds to know that.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:23.720]  I talked about this before. I still think it's interesting that the Apple, when they when they had me, they had a briefing for the new iPad and Clips app and stuff.
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:30.720]  And I went up to New York and saw it. They they don't have a special keyboard for the new nine point seven inch iPad.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:40.720]  But in collaboration with Logitech, they're supporting this Logitech case slash keyboard, which is sort of it's very thick.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:51.720]  It's like rugged, but it's you know, you can totally see if you think about it in the context of like a K12 school, you think, oh, yeah, I can see why they would love that, because it looks like something that would easily survive like a drop.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:46:00.720]  But one of the reasons it's important is that you put it in this case, you put the iPad in this case that's totally surrounded and it has a lightning port inside.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.720]  And I don't know if it has a battery or not, but that means that it's not a Bluetooth connection to the keyboard.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:22.720]  It's a hardware connection to the keyboard through lightning. And that's essential for K12 because all of the standardized tests that take place on a computer, it's mandated that there's no wireless connectivity.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:34.720]  And you can understand, you know, it's I see I get it. No wireless whatsoever. It's like complete airplane mode. Otherwise, the software detects that you're not in airplane mode and won't run.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.720]  And I can totally see why Apple did that.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:43.720]  I feel like if a kid can cheat via Bluetooth, that would be pretty impressive. But yeah, I understand.
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:50.720]  From what I mentioned this the other week on the show with Dan Fromer, he said that he and his friends used to, I forget if he said PalmPilots, I forget what they had.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:55.720]  But when he was in high school, they had something and they were IRing their cheats to each other.
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:04.720]  Oh, I wonder if they, I remember like, you know, remember like the TI calculus, the Texas Instruments, sort of scientific calculators.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:11.720]  We used to have all sorts of fun things on that. I think you could run Doom, like an emulator to run Doom on it and some other fun stuff.
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:23.720]  Yeah, you're too young. You're too young for me. I didn't have anything of that capability, but we had calculators that had, they just had the numeric display, but you could type letters in them too.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:34.720]  But it was a one row and it had like memory functions. And so our cheat, our way of cheating was to put the briefest possible cheat notes in those memory functions.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:42.720]  And then you would bring them up and instead of just being numbers, it would, you know, be some sort of like 32 character. Oh yeah, that's how you, you know, that's how you do it.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.720]  Yep. Yeah. Children find a way, no matter the technology.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.720]  Anything else that you want to talk about?
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:48:05.720]  The only other thing, and we can sort of briefly talk about it, just because I did think it was interesting. You had sort of a shortest rant in linking to something and it does relate directly, maybe to some of the iPad stuff we were just talking about, is the app bundle size thing.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:14.720]  Because there was also like, you and I had a, not really back and forth, I responded to you and they both got a ton of, yours and mine both got a ton of likes because I think this resonates with people.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:27.720]  You were talking about in that tweet, the Dropbox app, like why is it 260 megabytes or whatever? And then in your linked posts, you were talking about the, someone wrote a breakdown of why the Facebook app is so big now, right?
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:40.720]  I, so I noticed this because I was without Wi-Fi service for a week or so. And so I was living entirely off LTE and I have, I upgraded our Verizon plan to quote unquote unlimited.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:55.720]  But I've read the fine print when we did it, like our family plan and unlimited is not really unlimited. There's, I forget what point, but there's a point where they reserve the right where in your month, if you go over like 20 gigabytes or something, they reserve the right to throttle you, something like that.
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:10.720]  It's not really unlimited. And so one of the things I did in the week or so I was without Wi-Fi is I didn't update any of my apps with update all. I would just go through and look for ones that I either thought were essential or like small.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:21.720]  And it's amazing how many apps, so more or less, I didn't update any app over a hundred megabytes. And by the end of the week, I had like 26 app updates. It's amazing. And it's amazing how many of them are over 200 megabytes.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:35.720]  I know. And I mean, that's without question, that's creeping up across all apps over time. It was, it was sort of one app, maybe it was the Clips app or something like that. It was one of Apple's apps. I noticed the other day, you know, I think it was Clips maybe.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:42.720]  And it was like six megabytes. And I was like, oh my God, I don't even remember the last time I saw an app update that was that tiny.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:57.720]  Because they're all now at least 50. And then many are over 100, some over 200, like you were talking about. And it's insane. And so I like that the thing you linked to, like sort of breaking down, looking, unpacking the, you know, Facebook's bundle for that.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:10.720]  And they just have so much cruft in there. That's, that's obviously duplicate duplicate copies of the same framework, duplicate copies of the same image assets. And even that, even if you got rid of all the duplicates, it still seems like it would be big.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:29.720]  But it's crazy. I know, I know from somewhat and I know one of the things is that it's these analytics packages that the apps are all using, and that they come as binary blobs, where you just they give you this framework to toss into your Xcode project, and the whole thing is in there.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:42.720]  And it's, you know, and then somebody else's from the SEO team on your company is like, well, we want this analytics product too. And then all of a sudden, you got two of them, and they add up to 100 megabytes. And it's not it's not even your app.
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:51:00.720]  Apple isn't innocent either, because the iWorks apps are humongous. Oh, huge. And Microsoft, those are some of the worst, the iWorks, all the productivity stuff. Whenever I have Microsoft Word, one of them, and it was like, it was like 600 megabytes. Like what in an app update? What are they doing?
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:19.720]  I presume it's all templates, and the image assets to go with the template. I can't imagine what else it would be. Different languages? I don't even know. One of the things I know, obviously, Facebook does, one of the reasons for the bloat is they're always including various A-B tests in their app.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:38.720]  And so they will trigger things based on country, I think based on other things as well, to try to, you know, A-B test various functionality. Back in the TechCrunch days, you know, I used to sort of know where to look and who to ask about sort of unpacking some of that, because you could always find stuff.
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:54.720]  I think I found the iPad version of the Facebook app when it was still bundled in before there was an official iPad version, because it was baked into the, you know, the standard iOS version. And so it was right there. And I'm sure they're always doing stuff like that.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:18.720]  I feel like it's getting out of control, though. And part of it is that I noticed it with this, I've noticed it before that, but I noticed it with this week where I didn't have Wi Fi. But I've noticed it before. And it just seems preposterous to me. I mean, like, I'm not saying I mean, we, you know, we were finicky and fussy. But Vesper, I'd looked it was the last version of Vesper, which is still in the App Store is 5.5 megabytes.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:46.720]  Wow. Yeah, that's impressive. A huge chunk of that is that we embedded a custom font. It's if we've used a system font, it would have been even significantly smaller. There's no reason for it. And it's really wasteful. And Facebook, after I mentioned that somebody wrote to me, and I forgot to even mention this, but it's a good point is Facebook updates their app all the time. So multiply the size of the update versus how frequently they have new versions. And it's
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  Yeah, I mean, they famously say in their update notes, we update the app every two weeks. That's all they say in the update. Right. So they do it every two weeks. And the same with Messenger, Messenger is almost as big, I feel like in that, you know, the Facebook Messenger product, and then Facebook has several other apps that are all sort of roughly in the same situation. And then that an offshoot of all of that reminds me of this was several weeks ago, Twitter actually added something in their settings to basically kill clear the cat.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:36.720]  clear the cache. And when I did that, I had like a gigabyte worth of information in there. Like what on earth, they were caching, I guess, images and gifts or something from like, years and years ago, it was a gigabyte worth of data. Twitter 140 characters.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:54:05.720]  So in a world where all but the newest devices were still sold in 16 gigabyte configurations, you can you can have a gigabyte of old tweets stored there. I don't know. But I feel like it's it's getting out of control. And I know that in the early years of the App Store, it was a pretty big deal. I think the limit was 100 where you could raise like 100 megabytes was the limit where it had to be on Wi Fi and otherwise you could be on cellular and it was a big deal for developers to stay under 100 because they wanted users to be able to update.
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:27.720]  As soon as they could. And if they were on cellular for an extended strike stretch, they wanted them to get the updates. But it seems like they've just blown past that. But it's a serious it adds up to serious bandwidth. So like, I checked like, I think I pay $50 a month for at&t cellular service on my iPad.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:39.720]  And I'm thinking about giving this up when I next get an iPad, but my strategy when I bought it's an iPad mini, and I got it, I don't two or three years ago, probably like three years ago, but that's my personal iPad.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:53.720]  And my strategy was I'm going to have Verizon service on our on the whole family's iPhones, and I'm going to get at&t on my iPad, so that if I'm ever somewhere where Verizon, you know, I got a vacation or something and there's no good Verizon service, I'll have at&t service.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  And I pay 5050 bucks for seven gigabytes a month. And I think I think Amy pays like 30 bucks for four gigabytes or five, I don't know. But it's very single digit gigabytes of bandwidth a month. And if you've only got four gigabytes of bandwidth in a month, and app updates are 200 megabytes each.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:28.720]  Like five app updates use up a quarter of your bandwidth, you could easily chew through the four gigabytes. And I don't feel like people know that I think people realize that, hey, if I'm going to stream video, that's going to chew up my bandwidth.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:38.720]  Like if I'm going to watch YouTube for an hour or two, I that's obviously I'm using on cellular, I'm using my bandwidth. If I watch a Major League Baseball game in the MLB app.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:55.720]  I know that I'm using a, you know, significant chunk of my bandwidth, like updating my apps doesn't feel like that should be squandering a huge percentage of my monthly bandwidth. But it is because people have, you know, a lot of people have a pretty low single digit number of gigabytes a month of bandwidth to use.
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:12.720]  Yeah, I mean, I had the exact same situation when I was last moving. Same thing, we were using sort of a tethered device, I think it was a Mifi unit that I just gotten and hooked up to our AT&T account. And not even explicitly, but I just either forgot, or I have too many devices to even remember every single one of them.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:22.720]  But I would just leave it on. If I left it on at night, we would always have to turn it off. Because if I left it on, they would auto update. Because you know, it considers it to be Wi Fi, because I'm connected to a Mifi unit, right.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:36.720]  And so it would auto update. And then I'd look at the bill, and we would blow past our whatever, like 20 gigs in like four days. There's almost all for map updates. We weren't watching video. It was like, it was crazy.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:49.720]  Marco has a funny story about that from years ago, he was at WWDC. And he was tethering, you know, in the era of relatively low gigabytes per month, and he was tethering and he wanted to set up so he could publish a podcast that they recorded.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:57:00.720]  And he left, he left his, he went to bed and he left his MacBook open and it downloaded and iTunes downloaded a new episode of Mad Men in HD. It cost him like $70.
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:06.720]  He got like a single episode of his show, you subscribe to it, it was like a $70 overage fee or something.
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:07.720]  That's funny.
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:22.720]  Anyway, no, that's a good topic. I don't know what's going on. But I feel like Apple's got to get on top of this because I don't feel like we're just crazy old men who are, you know, get off my lawn with your big ass apps. There's no reason for these apps to be so big. There's absolutely no reason for it.
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:39.720]  It reminds me, well, two things it reminds me of, because one, it reminds me of back when, you know, they tried to launch magazines on the iPad, right? And like, they were massive, because they were just pictures of pages, right? They would like scan in a picture of Wired magazine, and that would be the app.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:56.720]  And so they were each individual article episode, each individual issue was like 700 to 800 megabytes. And it was just so ridiculous and so tedious to download. They seem to have streamlined that a little bit. Obviously, there's less of an emphasis on it these days.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:58:01.720]  But I noticed they just down, they're downloading faster. So I assume that they're smaller.
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:07.720]  The one other thing is, this actually came out a couple weeks ago, I think.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:28.720]  So Twitter now, one of the things Twitter launched recently was Twitter Lite, L-I-T-E. It's like the Lite version of their service because of this problem, right? Like in developing countries, they can't possibly download, you know, 250 megabyte apps or have your Twitter app store a gigabyte worth of data.
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:44.720]  And so they ended up launching, it's just on the web. And it's the same thing Facebook did back in the day. This was several years ago, they launched a Facebook Lite. And like, when they launched these things, like, you know, everyone seems to praise them for it, because it's like, wow, it's so great. It's so fast.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:59.720]  I remember I wanted, I would try to use Facebook Lite as my main thing, even though it was meant for sort of third world countries. So they're all like, they have these funny ways around it, because they know that that situation is just completely untenable, certainly outside of the United States.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:03.720]  And so they have like whole teams now devoted to launching Lite versions of their product.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:26.720]  I don't know what the solution is, but something's got to be done because it's getting out of hand and it's only getting worse. I just can't help but feel too that when I read that technical analysis of the Facebook app bundle and how many duplicate resources and frameworks they have, like the project, the Xcode project to build it must be like a total like mess of spaghetti logic.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:33.720]  Yeah, there's just no way that you get in that situation. There's no good, there's no good explanation behind that.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:45.720]  Well, and the problem also, I assume, you know, unlike sort of like, like you with Vesper, where, you know, you have a very small team working on it, you know, Facebook presumably has hundreds, if not more people working on all of these things.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:51.720]  And so you can say, like, just, you know, streamline some of it. But it's like, whose job is that? You need like an overseer of the code.
[01:59:51.720 --> 02:00:11.720]  I guess I mean, I guess I can see how it happened. But it's still not a good explanation where if the people who are working on their Snapchat clone need, they need to depend to build it, they need a copy of the Facebook, you know, framework that everybody uses this framework with our core shared code.
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:24.720]  But the other teams need the same thing, but they can't depend on where that is. And that's all of a sudden how you have three copies of the same framework, because team A needed it, team B needed it. And, you know, all of a sudden,
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:30.720]  I also really liked his, his note about like, you know, finding the strings that were like, you will be fired if you include if you turn this on.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.720]  Right, or if you use this API. That was funny, too.
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:42.720]  And, you know, my joke back to you about the Dropbox one was like, well, yeah, of course, because they're including the Dropbox stories into it.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:56.720]  But I think someone else had an even funnier one, I thought, which is like for the Facebook ones where it's like, well, yeah, of course, they're that big. I mean, they had to shove all of Snapchat into the app. So what else are you gonna do?
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:08.720]  I'm looking here anything I do want to talk about clips a little bit or, or we can I don't I don't have to I've played with it a little bit. I found it confusing when I was first using it, but I only have played with it for a few minutes.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:21.720]  It sounds like, you know, you, you did the sit down sort of a walkthrough with Apple about it. What's from, from your view, what's their, what's their mentality? I know you said something like, you know, obviously, they didn't launch a social network.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:29.720]  It's just meant for other networks, right? But why why do it? Is it a reason to buy the iPhone? Like, what's what's the rationale?
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:42.720]  I think the rationale is that they see these things as an I don't think we collectively have a name for it yet. But that it's a new medium. It's not quite a video. It's not quite an animated gift.
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:55.720]  It's sort of, but it's it's got all these ideas where you can use text to annotate, you can include multiple clips. So it's not just one shot of video, you can include stills.
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:10.720]  It's meant to be viewed on a phone. And you can do it with minimal fuss and that it's right up their alley to make it's like the social networks are how they get distributed, right? Instagram and Snapchat and Facebook, of course.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:19.720]  But that the tools to actually make the best possible version of this is exactly in Apple's wheelhouse of the sort of things that they do well.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:31.720]  And I still stand by I'm very proud of it as a tweet length review that it's like iMovie and keynote had a baby and the baby got the best genes from both parents. Like I really do believe that.
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:45.720]  I have a couple of small complaints about it. But one thing that they do that's very smart, and I think it's why the bundle size is so small, is that all that they have all these like titles and certainly music soundtracks.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:52.720]  They're not included in the download. And so when you start using the app fresh, if you want to get these soundtracks, you have to download them.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.720]  Okay, that's good. Maybe that's what like Facebook and others should learn.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:06.720]  I think it's a great idea. I think it's so you can start using the app with a minimal download and just download. And so if you are on cellular or slow network, you can just download the ones you really want.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:18.720]  My only beef about it is I do wish there was a download all button. Like in iTunes, you can do that. So like if you're using the iTunes music library, you can have a music album that's in the cloud.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:26.720]  And if you just want one song, you can download it. But if you want to download the whole album, you can download the whole album without clicking 11 times to download.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:31.720]  I feel like Eclipse should have that for the title styles and for the music soundtrack.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:39.720]  Why do you think, though, that they launched it when they did? Why not make it a feature of iOS 11? Why do it as a fully standalone thing?
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:51.720]  That's a good question. I guess because it's ready and they feel like why not? That's my guess. And that, you know, maybe that they, you know, they see this as an exploding form.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:59.720]  You know, these sort of stories based meme style mini videos.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:09.720]  You know, one of the other things, too, that I think is central to it is that being silent is part of, you know, you can include sound. You can include including those music soundtracks.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:15.720]  But the fact that a lot of people are going to listen to them in silence is part of the idea.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:25.720]  And it's part of why they spent so much effort on this annotated text that gets the text as you as you, you know, as you dictate it.
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:39.720]  I feel like that they see this is this is my guess is that they see this art form is exploding and that it makes sense to get it out sooner rather than later, because iOS 11 isn't going to ship until September if they're on schedule.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:48.720]  So it's right. So if they're ready to go now in early April, and I think it is I think the app is certainly certainly in 1.0 shape. It's very good 1.0 shape.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:58.720]  I feel like they don't want to wait, you know, maybe maybe do less as big monolithic OS updates and keep doing more as individual app updates.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:09.720]  Do you buy anything into the notion of this being sort of a toe dip into augmented reality? Because obviously we see that we see both Microsoft, Google and a handful of others sort of launched some of these things.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:18.720]  Microsoft just launched one thing called like sprinkles the other day, which is, you know, effectively using some of their machine learning technology to sort of alter images.
[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:23.720]  Google just launched that thing where you can doodle and it will look up, you know, try to match it to a picture.
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:30.720]  So all of these guys are clearly doing that as both experimentation, but also to sort of train data right to be better at that.
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:40.720]  Do you buy Apple trying to do that? Anything with it for augmented reality? A little bit, because I feel like you have to call the face recognition as augmented reality, right?
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:47.720]  I mean, maybe it's not augmenting it, but it certainly is. It's reality aware. Is that a better way to say it?
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:56.720]  You know, where if you shoot a clip and it has three of your friends in it and the facial recognition is able to identify them and the fact that when you go to share it,
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:07.720]  they're the first three people that suggest sharing it to, it's not quite augmented reality in the sense of, okay, here's goggles that show you the real world and overlay things.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.720]  But it is machine learning for sure.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:19.720]  It is. And it is the device in your hand is making is aware of the real world. It is saying, I know that I'm shooting. That's a picture of your son.
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:30.720]  You know, I know that. You know, I almost feel like augmented reality is a term that's not going to pan out.
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:37.720]  I feel like it's more just devices being reality aware.
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:49.720]  Yeah. And I think like, I don't disagree with that because I do think, you know, sort of everyone assumed augmented reality would be sort of like what the Magic Leap videos are, right?
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:55.720]  Where it's like you're looking out and you have glasses on or something and then a whale jumps out of the street.
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:07.720]  But what we're seeing is like the mainstream usage, at least right now, of course, of what you would call quote unquote augmented reality is more along lines of Snapchat filters and Pokemon Go, right?
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:15.720]  Where they're just different. There's there's nuance to how they're they're not quite not quite like that.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:26.720]  Pokemon goes a little bit more like that, but Snapchat's more just what you were talking about, sort of, you know, being able to to recognize a face and do manipulation of that.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:33.720]  And if you think about it with a little bit of battery, you could like why?
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:39.720]  Why can't your iPhone be as aware of where it is as as you are?
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:49.720]  There's I think it's I don't think we're very far from this at all. And I mean this in the sense of beyond GPS like GPS is is certainly one aspect of knowing where it is.
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:08:01.720]  But like when I'm walking down Broad Street in Philadelphia, like if you had me blindfolded until the moment and then you open my eyes,
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:08.720]  it's only going to take me an instant or two to realize, you know, where I am on Broad Street in Philadelphia because I'm very familiar with it.
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:13.720]  Well, if I have my phone in my hand, why can't the phone use the camera very briefly and just take a quick look?
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:18.720]  A quick, quick peek and instantly realize, oh, I know exactly where I am.
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:24.720]  I'm at Broad and Spruce in Philadelphia because I recognize this instantly the way that a human can.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:31.720]  And and Merlin Mann and I talked about this recently on the show, but we can't go in depth on these voice assistants.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:41.720]  But like things like this is very good in a lot of ways. But why can't devices like recognize every voice in the family?
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.720]  It seems to me like we're very going to be very close to that because a human being certainly could.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:55.720]  If we had a human being in our kitchen, the human being would know instantly whether it was me or my wife or my son who is asking for the weather.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:59.720]  And now it doesn't matter. Maybe if the question is, what's the weather like? It doesn't matter who it is.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.720]  But if it's what's on my agenda, they should certainly not. Oh, yeah, we will.
[02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:07.720]  That will absolutely happen. I would say that happens in short order.
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.720]  And you start thinking about these things. And I think about like, oh, how would you program something?
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:15.720]  How would you think about making a computer that does this? And you think about what our ears can do.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:20.720]  And it's like when you're familiar with your with your house or whatever, it's not just that you know who's talking to you,
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:23.720]  but you can basically tell where they're talking to you from.
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:29.720]  Like if somebody's upstairs from you and they're yelling, MG, you know, can you blah, blah, blah.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.720]  You know that they're upstairs. You can hear it. Your ears pick up that location.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:39.720]  And like, why can't these devices know that? Right. Context awareness.
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:46.720]  And yeah, I mean, but look at like Apple still does the thing right where you have to sort of train quote unquote Siri when you start.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:51.720]  Right. You have to say like, hey, Siri. And so it'll only illuminate with your voice.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:10:00.720]  That's still right. Right. Yeah. Well, it's supposedly, but it's it's not it's not very accurate, in my opinion, in terms of locking people out.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.720]  Like, in fact, I think my wife just used Siri on my phone.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:09.720]  I'm not sure if she pressed the button or not, though. And if that's the case, that's sort of weird that they even make you do that.
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:16.720]  If it's just not, you know, because obviously like you don't sort of voice train.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:23.720]  And I don't think the Google one either right now. I just triggered.
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:30.720]  We'll have to beep it. Yeah. It's so hard to talk about these things on a podcast.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.720]  You saw that thing that just like that news broke. I didn't read the full story about it.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:40.720]  But I saw that someone Burger King's trying to do a commercial that triggers the Google home.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:52.720]  Oh, really? I did not see that. And I think I saw that Google is already going to block that because that's a whole can of worms, obviously.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:58.720]  That's a bad idea. But anyway, I feel like there's a lot to go in that direction.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:03.720]  I still feel like one of the main areas where Apple is, I think it's just that they just didn't have it ready.
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:08.720]  But the way that they don't share the facial recognition data between your different devices is a huge hole.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:14.720]  And I think that they will. And I think that their whole explanation last year that it was about privacy was just right.
[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:20.720]  It wasn't that it wasn't like we believe so much in privacy that we're not going to share this between your devices.
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:28.720]  I think that the reading between the lines, the answer is we believe in privacy and we don't have a private way to share it between your devices yet.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.720]  And so we're not going to do it. We're not going to do it in a way that we're not satisfied with the privacy until we have it ready.
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:44.720]  But I think it's inevitable that they will. Right. And they made a bunch. I can't remember the exact name or word differential technology, differential privacy.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:49.720]  Sharing personal information, differential privacy is is about fully anonymized.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:59.720]  But like real private, you know, like they're they they do share stuff between their devices, like in the same way that you can get end to end encrypted iMessages on multiple devices.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:05.720]  It's not like they don't believe in in non duplicating private information between your devices.
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:11.720]  It's just that they're for whatever reason, the photo face ID stuff wasn't it wasn't technically ready. That's my belief.
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:17.720]  It's not that they're never not going to do it. But for something like Clips, it would really help.
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:28.720]  And we'll see. I mean, my guess is that their stance, you know, just maybe doesn't fully change over time because, you know, they've obviously they've taken the privacy stance.
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:33.720]  Like you mentioned, but like the implications of that were that they were going to try to do as much on the device as possible.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.720]  And I think, you know, that's fine and good and we'll see what they can do with that.
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:46.720]  But I would imagine that if they really need to get in the game for all of these things that we're talking about in a big way, they are going to have to start doing a lot in the cloud.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:57.720]  And so then, yeah, it becomes like a question of how they do it, whether it's a differential privacy or if they're they come up with other new technologies to so that they feel OK with the privacy sort of thing.
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:02.720]  The privacy sort of tradeoffs. But there's always going to be tradeoffs. All right. We've gone on pretty long.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.720]  Do you want to spend five minutes on Netflix and Amazon or do you want to do you want to wrap it up?
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:12.720]  The problem is, I think that that's just such a such a long. I say we save it for the next time you're on the show.
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:16.720]  OK, let's see. I feel like I feel like like doing it quick wouldn't do it justice.
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:22.720]  And I feel yes, I and both of them are so active in this regard that there's going to be new stuff to talk about soon.
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:28.720]  But anyway, I'm with you that I feel like they're both super fascinating. Yes.
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.720]  What's your favorite Netflix show? We really liked The Queen.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:37.720]  I didn't see that. You should see it. It's good. It was the one that's the most expensive one.
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:42.720]  I think I think they said it's more expensive than Game of Thrones to me.
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:48.720]  Yeah. Because of the costumes and it's you know, it's obviously a full period piece.
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:54.720]  And yes, so it's supposedly the most expensive. I don't know if it's the most expensive show ever, but it's, you know, ahead of Game of Thrones.
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:14:00.720]  So it's got to be up there. And that was really well done on Amazon.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.720]  Right now, we're watching The Man in the High Castle, which I like. It was a little slow to get really starting to really like.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:17.720]  Oh, I almost gave up on it. I almost gave up. Yeah. Same, same. My favorite thing that either of them are doing is Netflix's incredible all in focus on comedy specials.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:23.720]  The Dave Chappelle ones are two of the best comedy specials I've seen in memory.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:28.720]  And they released them both at the same time. They were both amazing.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.720]  And it's I like comedy specials in general, but my wife does, too.
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:40.720]  And so it's like this perfect sweet spot of, oh, my God, every single time one of these comes out, we've got something we're both looking forward to watching together.
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.720]  And they just keep coming out. It's Dave Chappelle and Amy Schumer.
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:52.720]  And now I just saw that there's a Louis C.K. one. It's almost like they're coming out with with them faster than we can watch, which is amazing.
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.720]  And so I'm surprised that like because this is like what HBO used to do back in the day.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.720]  Right. HBO would have all the comedy specials, I guess, in the 90s.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:10.720]  And I'm sort of surprised because it is such a relatively, you know, cheap versus, you know, doing a full production of a television show or something.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:16.720]  It's like Avenue to Go Down. They just give a ton of money to the comedian, you know, like 20 million dollars.
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.720]  I think Chappelle got 20 million. I forget something like that. But it's you know.
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:24.720]  I know that Will Seinfeld got I think it's a hundred million for his show.
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.720]  You know, the comedians getting coffee with comedians or whatever in cars.
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:32.720]  Is that moving networks? Is that moving? Yes, it's moving over to Netflix.
[02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:37.720]  And so they bid up the rights. Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, man.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:43.720]  That's brilliant. That's absolutely brilliant, because I feel like he would be doing the same thing whether it was televised or not.
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:47.720]  So he's getting a hundred million dollars to. Oh, yeah. I mean, he says that.
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:51.720]  I mean, because it was on like Crackle or whatever. And like he was just like, yeah, he just had this crazy idea.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.720]  And someone said, we'll put up the cost. OK, great.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:59.720]  But here's the thing. And again, we won't go too deep on it.
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:04.720]  But I remember as a kid growing up, all the great comedy specials were on HBO and I didn't really think about it.
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:11.720]  But I assumed it was I only thought about it from the perspective of commercial interruptions would wreck it.
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:18.720]  You can't interrupt the whole point of a great stand up routine is that it's it builds continuously.
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:28.720]  And there's never a good point for commercial break and be almost all of them have material that would be inappropriate for major networks.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:34.720]  And so, of course, HBO is the natural home because they can put R rated content up and they have no commercial breaks.
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:45.720]  And so that's why it's on HBO. What never occurred to me until Netflix has suddenly gotten become the dominant force in standup comedy specials is that they're evergreen.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:53.720]  That they can show like the Dave Chappelle 2017 comedy special is something that people were going to watch five, six years from now, like six, seven years from now.
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:17:01.720]  Some kid is going to all of a sudden discover Dave Chappelle and the Dave Chappelle comedy specials that are exclusive to Netflix is good.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.720]  They're going to watch them back to back to back to back. Right. It's evergreen.
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:10.720]  And it's right. Exactly. It's the perfect type of content for what Netflix and Amazon are doing.
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:16.720]  Because like in the HBO days, like we were talking about, there was no concept of on demand. You had to watch it when it was on.
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:24.720]  Now, now we live in an on demand world and you need if you want to have some sort of differentiation of content.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:32.720]  I mean, it's hard to beat, but I can see now how in hindsight that was part of HBO strategy back in the day is that HBO could show their Eddie Murphy comedy special a year later.
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:42.720]  They could just put it and they could put it on at five in the morning and somebody would be up and be like, oh, Eddie Murphy, I'll watch that, you know, that it would fill up space and that it would never really.
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:48.720]  You know, that it was as close to evergreen as you could get for exclusive content.
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:18:01.720]  Yeah, the one things that aren't doing that well, it seems like are and maybe you have a better example, but like so the talk shows that have moved over, like the actual like sort of late night things like there was the Chelsea, Chelsea, right.
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:08.720]  Which I don't think was I don't even know if it's still on. It might be, but I don't think that's like a weird format for Netflix.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:35.720]  Right. Do you agree? Like it's, um, yeah, I, I watched it a few times and I, as a talk show aficionado, uh, I do, I liked it and I thought, you know, and, and there's this whole, you know, meta discussion for years now of, you know, how come there aren't any women with, with late night comedy shows, you know, and even in this era when Jay Leno and Letterman were retiring and there was time for turnover, the show still went to two guys.
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.720]  Um, right. And so I was interested in Chelsea handler show and I liked it and I watched quite a few episodes, but never ever.
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:54.720]  Grooved on me and I don't know why. And there is something to a talk show, a late night talk show where it feels like it's supposed to be on at a certain time. Even if I watch it, there's a ritual to it. Yes, totally. Even if I watch it on TV, which I usually did.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:07.720]  And it feels like this was the show from Tuesday and it was on at 1130 and you know that it was on at Tuesday at 1130 and the Netflix style of here it is and you can watch it whenever it somehow doesn't seem right.
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:18.720]  But on the other hand, I definitely Chelsea handler show. It definitely felt like a late night talk show. It didn't feel like, like, uh, Ellen DeGeneres's show, which very clearly is a daytime talk show.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:36.720]  And I, you know, we could spend it, you could teach a whole class on what are this lighting and differences. Yeah, but I, you can tell, you know, I don't know, you know, it's, uh, I don't know how to explain it, but I know when I see it, there's late night shows and daytime talk shows and Chelsea handlers was a late night talk show.
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:58.720]  And that reminds me of, I wrote about this a while ago, I guess when Stranger Things was on. So, you know, the Netflix show. I love Stranger Things. I thought it was great, but I kept thinking to myself while we're watching it, like, yeah, it's cool that we can binge watch it, but it almost feels like the type of show where it would have been better suited for sort of a weekly cadence type thing.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:04.720]  And there's like, you know, release watches, you know, sort of like what we do, what people do for Game of Thrones now.
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:16.720]  Yeah, especially with the cliffhanger endings, you know, I don't know. I do feel, if there's anything I think Netflix should rethink is I think it's, they should, they should rethink their, we're just going to drop the whole season at once for all of our shows.
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:22.720]  I don't think that they should do that. I think that for some shows it works and for some shows it's actually robbing us of some fun.
[02:20:22.720 --> 02:20:35.720]  Yeah, and I think their stance on the matter is we have this very, this very regimented worldview of that and this is, we want people to know that all of our content is always going to be available when they sign up.
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:47.720]  But I do, I would bet that over time they do get more nuanced with that and they do have some shows that launch like that and some that don't and they're starting to get more into movies now and there's obviously all this sort of back and forth between theater owners,
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:21:02.720]  like some of them want to make sure that the movie is still screened in a theater for Oscar contention and whatnot and Amazon has been more amenable to that I guess and Netflix still has been very strict in saying nope has to go on Netflix, the exact moment that sort of it launches.
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:06.720]  And I would imagine that they have to sort of give and take a little bit on some of those things.
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.720]  So much for not spending five minutes talking about Netflix and Amazon.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:18.720]  I would say this, I think Game of Thrones, I enjoy it. I enjoy it very much. I look forward to it coming back. I watch it every week.
[02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:29.720]  I would rank it as one of my favorite shows of all time. Is it top 10? I don't know. It's close. It's certainly in the top 20 but it may not be in the top 10. I'm not a huge superfan.
[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:43.720]  But I would say this, I think it's the best show ever in the history of these modern super shows at making that weekly cliffhanger add to the show.
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:58.720]  I feel like it's the best. There's a bunch of shows that I've enjoyed more but Game of Thrones and I think it's partly just that they're very self-aware of their we're on Sunday night and we're going to make you talk about us Monday.
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:12.720]  And combined with the fact that there's like a thousand characters. So a show like Mad Men, which I would possibly argue is my all-time favorite show, it's certainly in my top two or three.
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:25.720]  It had a somewhat smaller number of characters and had one character who is clearly the protagonist of the story that it would have been artificial to have a cliffhanger every week.
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:39.720]  Most weeks, more weeks often than not, it didn't leave you dying for the next episode. And that was just the way the show was written and it was very natural to it. But Game of Thrones is really, really good at that.
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:44.720]  I feel like Game of Thrones that was dumped 10 episodes at once would lose so much.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:56.720]  Yes, totally. And the notion used to be that you would save the cliffhanger for the season end because it's just so hard to do them week after week and Game of Thrones pulls it off better.
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:05.720]  Breaking Bad was pretty good about it. Then there's a handful of other shows that I think were good at it. But yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:19.720]  And the fact that they do it and they had to translate it from books, right? So it's not like the books are, obviously they follow them to a certain extent, but the cliffhanger thing is just a page turn away. So it's different.
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:29.720]  Well, one of the books I remember having that feeling with was when I first read The Lord of the Rings, because I remember with The Lord of the Rings where the chapters would, you'd leave Sam.
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:30.720]  Yeah, one location.
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:38.720]  You'd leave Frodo and Sam and you'd go back to somebody and you'd be like, oh my god, why are we going back to them? I want to find out what happened Frodo and Sam. Geez, that's terrible.
[02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:43.720]  And then all of a sudden, three pages later, forget about Frodo and Sam, you're with these other guys.
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:48.720]  And that is what the Game of Thrones books do as well. They focus on one individual storyline.
[02:23:48.720 --> 02:24:03.720]  And I love those books. Who doesn't love those books? But part of the brilliance of the structure was the way that every single chapter I was desperate to keep going with who I was with and was very upset to go back to these other characters.
[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:09.720]  But then three pages later, I'm all totally into them. And I feel like Game of Thrones has that in TV.
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:21.720]  I can't believe, I know they're going to pull it off, but I really can't believe that they're going to pull off like finishing the whole series before even the next book, you know, there's still two more books to come.
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:35.720]  And I think they're going to finish the series before even the next book comes. And it's just incredible. Like, you would have thought like this would have been the ultimate logistical nightmare when you're sort of pitching the show, right?
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:42.720]  Like, what's the worst that could happen? Well, we could not have sort of know what the ending is going to be because the other books haven't come out yet.
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:47.720]  Oh, come on. That's, you know, a decade away. Of course, we're going to have those. And nope, we're not going to have them.
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:53.720]  I don't know. I don't know how that doesn't make any sense to me. I haven't read the books, though. So I don't I don't really care.
[02:24:53.720 --> 02:25:02.720]  It's just insanely impressive of the showrunners of that show that they're able to sort of land the ship without having the infrastructure you would think to do so.
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:08.720]  Yeah. I wonder if that's going to really hurt the show. I wonder how much they depend on that.
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:14.720]  I don't know. It's it's it is actually unprecedented to know what would what will end up happening with that.
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:20.720]  Like, do they because they say the show's only going to. So this coming season, which I think starts in July, is going to be slightly truncated, right?
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:28.720]  It's going to be, I think, seven, six or seven episodes, not 10. And then they're going to split that into the next season, which will also be a truncated season.
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:34.720]  And that's the end. Really? But do that's that's what the word is right now.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:43.720]  I don't know if they're going to change that at all. Do they end up doing something like, you know, ending it with a with a movie in a few years or something like that?
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:47.720]  But as of right now, I think the plan is just two more seasons, two more shortened seasons.
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:53.720]  I don't know. I don't know how they're going to do it. I look forward to it, though. All right. M.G., thank you so much for your time.
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  It's always good to have you on the show. Yes, thank you.
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:02.720]  I will see you soon. And everybody can catch you on Twitter. What's your Twitter handle?
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.720]  At M.G. Seigler.
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:11.720]  At M.G. Seigler. And you're the place where they can catch the writing. Is it all your writing or just most of your writing?
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:12.720]  Most of it.
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:13.720]  Five hundred-ish words.
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:15.720]  Five hundred-ish dot com.
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:17.720]  Five hundred-ish dot com.
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:18.720]  Yes.
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:22.720]  And good stuff. Still good columns coming out of you.
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:29.720]  Thanks. When I get a free moment in between everything else that I do now these days.
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:30.720]  All right. Thank you very much.
[02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:59.720]  Thank you, John.
