[00:00.000 --> 00:09.040]  Good evening, podcast listeners.
[00:09.040 --> 00:20.000]  It's once again time for a daring Fireball presentation of the Talk Show Live.
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.520]  We're coming to you from Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference 2019.
[00:25.520 --> 00:32.560]  And now, the man we've all been waiting for, Jon Gruber.
[00:32.560 --> 00:45.960]  Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Talk Show.
[00:45.960 --> 00:48.720]  I am Jon Gruber, your internet friend.
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.800]  Oh my God, this is so embarrassing.
[00:52.800 --> 00:53.800]  I am that guy.
[00:53.800 --> 00:59.600]  I am the guy who came out on stage with a device with a beta OS.
[00:59.600 --> 01:08.600]  And it is going off.
[01:08.600 --> 01:32.160]  It's a little buggy.
[01:32.160 --> 01:33.160]  My blue cards.
[01:33.160 --> 01:34.160]  All right.
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.160]  Before we get started, I would like to thank our sponsors, without whom this show would
[01:39.160 --> 01:42.280]  not be possible.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.440]  First sponsor, longtime sponsor of this show, Mac Stadium.
[01:47.440 --> 01:55.520]  They do Mac infrastructure.
[01:55.520 --> 01:57.520]  They host Macs.
[01:57.520 --> 02:00.560]  I don't know if they heard any good news on the keynote.
[02:00.560 --> 02:01.800]  I haven't talked to them this week.
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.920]  I mean, I know they're around and I know there's some of the fine folks that are in here.
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.280]  But they have over 20,000 Macs in data centers around the world.
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.960]  They are ready for all Mac deployments, including Mac Minis, iMacs, even Xserves.
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.960]  Am I missing something?
[02:18.960 --> 02:21.960]  Jon, what am I missing?
[02:21.960 --> 02:29.120]  Mac Pro, Rack Malibu.
[02:29.120 --> 02:36.520]  They are heavily invested in security, scalability, and support for iOS and Mac development, having
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.560]  a server where you can do builds, all sorts of useful stuff you guys know about.
[02:40.560 --> 02:41.920]  They're a great company.
[02:41.920 --> 02:43.880]  This week, they're announcing ORCA.
[02:43.880 --> 02:51.480]  That's ORCA with a K, and it stands for orchestration with Kubernetes, which I was going to pronounce
[02:51.480 --> 02:54.760]  Kubernetes.
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.120]  And I checked, and they said Kubernetes, and I thought, you know what, I should have just
[02:58.120 --> 02:59.120]  pronounced it wrong.
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.960]  It would have been more on brand.
[03:01.960 --> 03:04.600]  I don't know why I asked.
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.960]  But it's the only way to do native Kubernetes commands, which I have no idea what that is,
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.440]  to create and orchestrate macOS VMs on genuine Apple hardware.
[03:15.440 --> 03:18.160]  It is also super fast.
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.720]  So for more information and exclusive discounts for you fine folks who are listening, go to
[03:22.720 --> 03:31.920]  macstadium.com slash the talk show, macstadium.com slash the talk show.
[03:31.920 --> 03:42.200]  Our next sponsor, The Omni Group.
[03:42.200 --> 03:43.320]  Sounds like you've heard of them.
[03:43.320 --> 03:45.020]  Of course you have.
[03:45.020 --> 03:48.760]  They are one of the all-time great indie iOS and Mac developers.
[03:48.760 --> 03:51.080]  They go all the way back to Next.
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.840]  They've been around for over 25 years, and it's a rare example of steady leadership in
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.600]  this field, a company that just keeps on top of the game.
[04:00.600 --> 04:05.720]  What they want to talk about is OmniFocus for the web, which just launched out of beta.
[04:05.720 --> 04:09.360]  Now, what they could have done, what most people do for a web backend to a service is
[04:09.360 --> 04:15.840]  they write their own web-type thing, and it's a web app, and they use web technologies.
[04:15.840 --> 04:22.240]  Instead, what these crazy people did is they're using the same Objective-C and Swift code
[04:22.240 --> 04:29.400]  that OmniFocus for Mac is built with, and they're running it on Mac servers, and they
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.160]  just have a web output display from the same code.
[04:33.160 --> 04:35.720]  Crazy, right?
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.940]  And so for all of the consternation that people like us and all the anger we have at developers
[04:40.940 --> 04:50.760]  who make web apps and then put them in a shell and call it their Mac app, the Omni group
[04:50.760 --> 04:51.760]  has done the right thing.
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.560]  They took their Mac app, and now it's on the web.
[04:54.560 --> 04:57.680]  Super, super great.
[04:57.680 --> 05:01.720]  It's so very Omni to do something so nutty sounding.
[05:01.720 --> 05:06.240]  Check it out at check out OmniFocus for the web.
[05:06.240 --> 05:10.840]  Find out more details, how to sign up for it, et cetera, et cetera.
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.800]  OmniFocus.com slash DF.
[05:13.800 --> 05:18.760]  That's OmniFocus.com slash DF.
[05:18.760 --> 05:28.040]  Third and final sponsor, another great company I bet a lot of you guys have heard of, Slack.
[05:28.040 --> 05:33.200]  Slack for iOS is used by millions of people every day, including me, to stay productive,
[05:33.200 --> 05:37.240]  whether they're bouncing between meetings or on the go.
[05:37.240 --> 05:43.120]  Their iOS team is focused on a variety of projects, from connecting businesses through
[05:43.120 --> 05:48.600]  shared channels to inventing tools for performance monitoring at very high scale, as you might
[05:48.600 --> 05:51.740]  imagine from how busy they are.
[05:51.740 --> 05:58.720]  If you, developers, want to sweat the details and help define the future of Slack for mobile,
[05:58.720 --> 06:01.960]  head on over to Slack.com slash careers.
[06:01.960 --> 06:06.980]  That's Slack.com slash careers, iOS app.
[06:06.980 --> 06:17.960]  Maybe these iOS developers at Slack will be Mac developers, I don't know.
[06:17.960 --> 06:19.120]  That's it for business.
[06:19.120 --> 06:25.920]  I have a special guest to come out, actually I guess I have two, looks like.
[06:25.920 --> 06:48.720]  So without any further ado, my guests for this evening, Craig Federighi, and Greg Goswiak.
[06:48.720 --> 07:02.640]  You are among your people, Craig.
[07:02.640 --> 07:08.560]  That was more applause than the Mac Pro guy.
[07:08.560 --> 07:18.920]  JAWS, you and I talked briefly yesterday and I said to you, first impressions after the
[07:18.920 --> 07:24.080]  keynote were, it was very, very exciting because you guys had so much to announce that hadn't
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.720]  leaked in advance, and that makes it fun and it makes it exciting.
[07:28.720 --> 07:32.280]  And then I said, and it also makes me realize that when more stuff does leak, it makes my
[07:32.280 --> 07:34.040]  job easier because...
[07:34.040 --> 07:39.440]  You have more time to digest, more time to process.
[07:39.440 --> 07:44.320]  We were talking backstage, you apparently, there is one Apple rumor site that you were
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.880]  a fan of.
[07:45.880 --> 07:51.760]  Well, which is funny because out of context it sounds bad because I shouldn't like any
[07:51.760 --> 07:58.340]  rumor site, but there was a rumor site and I hope John Moltz still listens to this show.
[07:58.340 --> 07:59.760]  You guys know what I'm talking about.
[07:59.760 --> 08:05.400]  This Apple rumor site was like gospel for us.
[08:05.400 --> 08:11.480]  Phil and I and the rest of the marketing team, we read it every morning with, oh my God,
[08:11.480 --> 08:13.480]  what is he going to say today?
[08:13.480 --> 08:19.040]  And what I didn't want to tell you backstage was one of our favorites was, first of all,
[08:19.040 --> 08:22.040]  take yourself back to 2002.
[08:22.040 --> 08:26.820]  And remember back then we had really one platform, Mac, right?
[08:26.820 --> 08:32.200]  And so we had a little bit more time to be theatrical in our two notes.
[08:32.200 --> 08:35.280]  Now we're like, get moving, get moving, get moving.
[08:35.280 --> 08:46.200]  So if you remember 2002, Steve had a very theatrical goodbye to Mac OS 9.
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.080]  Those of you who remember it, it was here at WWDC back in May, I think it was Mother's
[08:50.080 --> 08:53.160]  Day when we did those things, and right after.
[08:53.160 --> 09:00.960]  And so he had this big scene, you had dry ice in this coffin that raised out of the
[09:00.960 --> 09:01.960]  ground.
[09:01.960 --> 09:07.760]  And you didn't know what's going on, you've got stained glass windows in the back and
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.880]  church music's playing and everybody's like, WTF, what's going on?
[09:13.880 --> 09:20.320]  And Steve comes out and quiets the audience and begins to read a eulogy, right?
[09:20.320 --> 09:28.080]  And opens up the coffin, puts a big Mac OS 9 in it and says his very tearful words he
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.360]  wrote, right, goodbye to Mac OS 9.
[09:31.360 --> 09:36.560]  And beautiful moment, then the coffin lowers back in and you think it's over until the
[09:36.560 --> 09:41.880]  next day, which John Moltz wrote, the continuation of the story.
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.480]  And for those that may remember, he wrote that Mac OS 9 started reaching back out from
[09:47.480 --> 09:50.680]  the grave saying, I'm not dead.
[09:50.680 --> 09:57.160]  And he did a very, as he wrote, just brilliant writing that he did about how Mac OS 9 was
[09:57.160 --> 10:03.400]  trying to get back out of the coffin and Steve was beating it back down into the coffin.
[10:03.400 --> 10:07.280]  And what made it even better is every week we had a weekly marketing staff with Steve
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.400]  and we showed Steve this, we're like, this is just priceless, you gotta read this.
[10:11.400 --> 10:18.720]  And so Steve reads it, not just to himself, he reads it out loud.
[10:18.720 --> 10:25.280]  So for us it was this continuation of his battle with Mac OS 9 as it's trying to say,
[10:25.280 --> 10:27.360]  I'm not dead yet.
[10:27.360 --> 10:30.600]  And Steve, it was priceless, let's say that.
[10:30.600 --> 10:36.120]  So then the one last thing, and John Moltz will probably hate us saying this, but Steve
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.840]  goes, that guy's a pretty good writer.
[10:38.840 --> 10:43.120]  And we can always use good writers, and why don't we reach out to him, see if he wants
[10:43.120 --> 10:44.440]  to come work at Apple.
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.380]  So Phil says, I'll write to him, because we wrote to him on occasion.
[10:47.380 --> 10:54.400]  And so Phil writes to John and says, hey, any interest in coming to work at Apple?
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.160]  He writes back, only if I ever got really desperate.
[10:59.160 --> 11:15.960]  All right, one of my jobs is to figure out what order I want to ask questions.
[11:15.960 --> 11:21.400]  And there was so much stuff announced yesterday that it's a struggle.
[11:21.400 --> 11:26.680]  But I don't want to run short on time talking about the things I'm most interested in, so
[11:26.680 --> 11:28.640]  I'm going to go in that order.
[11:28.640 --> 11:29.640]  And I can't.
[11:29.640 --> 11:33.600]  So the show's going to go downhill all the way?
[11:33.600 --> 11:34.600]  Wow.
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.700]  I'm not really interested in the answer to this question.
[11:39.700 --> 11:44.360]  With the head of software engineering right here at our disposal for an hour, I can't
[11:44.360 --> 11:48.560]  think of anything better to talk about than hardware.
[11:48.560 --> 11:55.840]  And you're saying that's what you want to talk about the most?
[11:55.840 --> 11:58.120]  That's what's most interesting to me, Seth.
[11:58.120 --> 11:59.120]  Totally.
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.560]  So I'll need to introduce you to Dan Riccio at some point.
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.080]  How many hardware engineers are in the audience?
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.280]  How many software engineers are in the audience?
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.840]  Heck yeah.
[12:08.840 --> 12:17.240]  All right, go ahead, ask your question.
[12:17.240 --> 12:23.320]  Two years ago, Apple invited a few of us in the press out for what you called a Mac roundtable.
[12:23.320 --> 12:31.800]  And it sort of laid your roadmap ahead of us and sort of acknowledged the, as you called
[12:31.800 --> 12:35.880]  it, the thermal corner you'd painted yourselves in with the previous generation Mac Pro.
[12:35.880 --> 12:36.980]  And here's where we're going to go.
[12:36.980 --> 12:41.920]  You guys even said we have a Pro iMac coming before that.
[12:41.920 --> 12:45.920]  All of those things have now come to pass.
[12:45.920 --> 12:53.680]  But there was definitely last year when it got to the point where there was a sort of
[12:53.680 --> 12:57.960]  a, hey, by the way, that Mac Pro thing we're talking about, that's not really a 2018 thing.
[12:57.960 --> 13:00.120]  That's a 2019 thing.
[13:00.120 --> 13:05.720]  The reaction from a lot of people I know was sort of, why can't they just make a big tower
[13:05.720 --> 13:07.880]  and poop it out?
[13:07.880 --> 13:23.320]  I think you're confusing us with a different computer company.
[13:23.320 --> 13:28.240]  The gist of it being, if this is going to take two years, this better be some fancy
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.440]  frigging hardware.
[13:29.440 --> 13:30.880]  I think that was answered.
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.240]  I think, you know, where have we been spending our time on this was answered in spades on
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.800]  Monday.
[13:38.800 --> 13:45.000]  I have questions though, because I'm still not sure I understand it all.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.900]  So you do understand the question.
[13:52.900 --> 13:56.400]  This is not like any other computer on earth.
[13:56.400 --> 14:05.160]  This is a lot of custom engineering, like, and the MPX module, that's Mac Pro expansion.
[14:05.160 --> 14:07.680]  Afterburner.
[14:07.680 --> 14:13.720]  Is Afterburner, is that an MPX module or that's its own card?
[14:13.720 --> 14:14.720]  Programmable ASIC.
[14:14.720 --> 14:19.280]  So it can be reprogrammed in milliseconds.
[14:19.280 --> 14:22.800]  Explain to me what that means by reprogramming it.
[14:22.800 --> 14:24.840]  What type of programming stuff?
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.840]  See?
[14:25.840 --> 14:31.040]  Josh revealed to me earlier today that he was a computer engineer in college, so.
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.440]  A long time ago.
[14:35.440 --> 14:37.380]  You saw what we're using it for right now.
[14:37.380 --> 14:45.480]  It literally can process 6 billion pixels a second doing the ProRes and ProRes RAW.
[14:45.480 --> 14:49.800]  It is a burner, hence the name of what actually led to us thinking let's call it Afterburner.
[14:49.800 --> 14:51.480]  Yeah, essentially programmable hardware.
[14:51.480 --> 14:55.160]  So you're programming these gates so that then once you have that going, I mean, things
[14:55.160 --> 14:58.000]  are going through in virtually dedicated hardware speed.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.880]  So that's what enables this ProRes decoding to happen at such staggering speeds and to
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.840]  offload the rest of the hardware to do everything.
[15:04.840 --> 15:08.840]  Does that mean that at some point in the future somebody could reprogram it to do something
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.840]  other than…
[15:09.840 --> 15:10.840]  Absolutely.
[15:10.840 --> 15:11.840]  Right.
[15:11.840 --> 15:21.400]  So the ProRes working with real size 5K, 8K, 3 streams of 8K, 3 streams of 8K.
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.520]  The way that this is a great breakthrough for people who work with that sort of video,
[15:26.520 --> 15:29.200]  that's just one thing that you're announcing that it can be done with.
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.200]  That's right.
[15:30.200 --> 15:31.200]  All right.
[15:31.200 --> 15:32.200]  Right.
[15:32.200 --> 15:33.200]  There's more to come.
[15:33.200 --> 15:34.200]  Like what?
[15:34.200 --> 15:37.640]  I mean, I'm not going to be announcing anything, but one could imagine.
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.380]  I can imagine quite a lot.
[15:41.380 --> 15:44.840]  And to your point about not being painted in a thermal window, I mean, you saw the stat
[15:44.840 --> 15:45.840]  on this.
[15:45.840 --> 15:50.360]  We literally moved 300 cubic feet of air through there a minute.
[15:50.360 --> 15:52.080]  Yeah, be careful walking by the thing.
[15:52.080 --> 15:54.160]  You're just going to get completely blown out of your office.
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.240]  But think about it, that's a pretty good size room that we can push that entire airflow
[15:58.240 --> 16:03.640]  through in a minute if we need to, and that's what allows us to run this thing at full speed
[16:03.640 --> 16:04.640]  all the time.
[16:04.640 --> 16:05.640]  Right?
[16:05.640 --> 16:07.640]  It doesn't have to throttle.
[16:07.640 --> 16:09.080]  Right.
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.040]  How much are the wheels going to cost?
[16:13.040 --> 16:26.360]  I mean, what really is a perfect wheel worth?
[16:26.360 --> 16:27.360]  How many do you want?
[16:27.360 --> 16:28.360]  I mean, yeah.
[16:28.360 --> 16:29.360]  How many do you need?
[16:29.360 --> 16:31.160]  Well, that's the thing.
[16:31.160 --> 16:33.480]  I'm imagining that they're very nice wheels.
[16:33.480 --> 16:38.840]  I was really sort of hoping that the hand, if there were wheels in the hands-on area,
[16:38.840 --> 16:39.840]  I missed them.
[16:39.840 --> 16:41.160]  I really, I wanted to sit there and.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.160]  There was one.
[16:42.160 --> 16:43.160]  Yeah.
[16:43.160 --> 16:50.560]  There are installment plans available for wheel purchases, and I'll save up.
[16:50.560 --> 16:56.960]  I have been told by a reliable source.
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.160]  That's that, it cuts out to that.
[17:01.160 --> 17:02.160]  Dark contrast to that.
[17:02.160 --> 17:06.000]  All right, it's coming out in the fall, and you guys like to keep other stuff secret.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.600]  You're going to show, here's a big unveil, but you're not revealing everything.
[17:09.600 --> 17:16.280]  I have been told that the Mac Pro will ship with the most, quote, insane packaging that
[17:16.280 --> 17:19.080]  Apple has done in a while.
[17:19.080 --> 17:21.080]  So who's your sort?
[17:21.080 --> 17:23.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:23.680 --> 17:25.560]  You'll just have to wait to see, John.
[17:25.560 --> 17:26.560]  Yeah.
[17:26.560 --> 17:36.240]  But you can imagine, it won't be shitty packaging.
[17:36.240 --> 17:38.760]  I told this story, and again, maybe I'm just out of touch.
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.440]  I have since been told that there are database servers with massive amounts of RAM.
[17:43.440 --> 17:52.040]  But during the keynote, I was sitting next to someone from Apple, and no, it's Bill Evans
[17:52.040 --> 17:53.040]  from PR.
[17:53.040 --> 17:55.320]  It's no big deal.
[17:55.320 --> 18:03.440]  But when it was announced that you could configure it with up to 1.5 terabytes of memory, I just
[18:03.440 --> 18:08.600]  instantly assumed that it meant storage, like SSD, and I was like, well, 1.5 terabytes isn't
[18:08.600 --> 18:09.600]  even that much.
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.080]  And I said, why are people applauding so much?
[18:13.080 --> 18:15.240]  This is a curious reaction.
[18:15.240 --> 18:18.880]  And I said, he didn't mean RAM, did he?
[18:18.880 --> 18:19.880]  And he goes, yeah, RAM.
[18:19.880 --> 18:20.880]  And I'm like, wait.
[18:20.880 --> 18:21.880]  He said 1.5 terabytes.
[18:21.880 --> 18:27.680]  And he said, just shut up and listen.
[18:27.680 --> 18:28.680]  But that's serious.
[18:28.680 --> 18:29.680]  It's a lot of memory.
[18:29.680 --> 18:30.680]  It's a serious memory.
[18:30.680 --> 18:36.880]  And in my experience, that's just, from my youth onward, that's just not how computers
[18:36.880 --> 18:37.880]  tend to evolve.
[18:37.880 --> 18:44.760]  So iMac Pro, which until Monday was the fastest computer you guys have ever had announced,
[18:44.760 --> 18:50.760]  maxes out at 256 gigabytes of RAM, which to me sounds like enough to open some browser
[18:50.760 --> 18:54.280]  tabs.
[18:54.280 --> 18:59.300]  And so the way computers have always worked my life is things happen like they double,
[18:59.300 --> 19:02.320]  or maybe you add another 128 and go to 384.
[19:02.320 --> 19:03.780]  You get these numbers like that.
[19:03.780 --> 19:08.040]  You don't just go from 256 gigabytes to 1.5 terabytes.
[19:08.040 --> 19:09.120]  That seems crazy.
[19:09.120 --> 19:11.040]  This machine is a sports car computer.
[19:11.040 --> 19:16.760]  Well, and going back to what you said, the conference that we had way back in 2017, we
[19:16.760 --> 19:18.720]  knew we had to create something really special.
[19:18.720 --> 19:22.640]  And that's why this wasn't, if you ever go walking the halls of CES and you see that
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.200]  you can buy these chassis from Taiwan and throw a chip in them and throw an operating
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.000]  system on it and you're in the computer business, that isn't what we were trying to do.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.680]  We were going to create something that was going to be really, really special and something
[19:34.680 --> 19:38.720]  we thought was really designed for our pro customers, including the display, right?
[19:38.720 --> 19:40.600]  That's just nuts in and of itself.
[19:40.600 --> 19:45.020]  So we knew that was going to take some time, hence why we were trying to set the expectation.
[19:45.020 --> 19:46.320]  Not soon.
[19:46.320 --> 19:51.680]  Well, speaking of the display, the Pro Display XDR is gorgeous.
[19:51.680 --> 19:54.320]  It is incredible.
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.400]  It was funny though, doing some of the behind the scenes stuff with the media and getting
[19:58.400 --> 20:02.560]  to see some side by side comparisons with some competing products and this, they kept
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.120]  calling it the 6K display and I couldn't tell if they were talking about the pixels of the
[20:06.120 --> 20:08.120]  price.
[20:08.120 --> 20:20.600]  I honest to God, I thought, because usually the people from product marketing are very
[20:20.600 --> 20:26.160]  precisely spoken and I've thought, and it was a really good presentation that was really
[20:26.160 --> 20:29.000]  well rehearsed and very, you know, like, yeah, I could see the difference.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.920]  And I was like, I can't believe she keeps calling it the 6K display, like enough already.
[20:34.920 --> 20:35.920]  Stop rubbing my nose.
[20:35.920 --> 20:42.720]  I like a thousand.
[20:42.720 --> 20:45.240]  The matte finish, which you're not really calling a matte finish, you're calling it
[20:45.240 --> 20:46.640]  a nano.
[20:46.640 --> 20:47.720]  Nano texture.
[20:47.720 --> 20:52.400]  That's because you probably got the briefing, the normal matte that people do, it'll cause
[20:52.400 --> 20:57.200]  us this sparkle or cause us this really weird effect on the screen and this is a process
[20:57.200 --> 21:02.220]  unlike anybody that's done before that etches the glass in a way that if you do the little
[21:02.220 --> 21:07.680]  test and shine a bright light on it, you see that it handles the glare in a way that no
[21:07.680 --> 21:08.680]  one's done before.
[21:08.680 --> 21:13.280]  It's an incredible process that we invented to do that.
[21:13.280 --> 21:18.460]  Make it clear, the standard display has industry leading anti-reflective coating, so it's wonderful
[21:18.460 --> 21:25.360]  in the base config, but if you really want the matte, the nano texture's just nuts.
[21:25.360 --> 21:29.620]  And side by side, I don't know how many people got to see it side by side, but I did.
[21:29.620 --> 21:34.140]  And when you're looking at it straight on with no glare, they look identical.
[21:34.140 --> 21:35.400]  You cannot tell them apart.
[21:35.400 --> 21:36.400]  The color's the same.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.400]  The brightness is the same.
[21:37.400 --> 21:38.400]  It's remarkable.
[21:38.400 --> 21:41.800]  And then if you angle your head in a way to kind of get like a glare, it is like there
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.840]  is no glare on the matte one.
[21:43.840 --> 21:46.200]  It is really something.
[21:46.200 --> 21:47.360]  It really is a special display.
[21:47.360 --> 21:51.040]  The amount of engineering that went in by our display team is just incredible, everything
[21:51.040 --> 21:58.720]  from the blue LEDs to how the light is literally shaped going through the LCD itself.
[21:58.720 --> 22:02.680]  You get a million to one contrast ratio, and as you heard Colleen, didn't Colleen do a
[22:02.680 --> 22:12.760]  great job on stage, by the way?
[22:12.760 --> 22:16.120]  It's extreme dynamic range.
[22:16.120 --> 22:18.560]  I joke about calling it the 6K display.
[22:18.560 --> 22:20.120]  It is expensive.
[22:20.120 --> 22:25.720]  And I think that from what I've seen in the last two days, I think some people are seeing
[22:25.720 --> 22:32.800]  this wrong, where it fits on the marketplace, that it is not for everybody.
[22:32.800 --> 22:39.400]  It is really, truly meant for people who are doing work that demands these insane specs.
[22:39.400 --> 22:41.640]  It's not like...
[22:41.640 --> 22:45.320]  Well you saw the competitive benchmark, which is the display that we showed in the keynote,
[22:45.320 --> 22:49.200]  the reference, the gold standard, cost $43,000.
[22:49.200 --> 22:55.200]  And what's amazing about it is you see them in that whole lineup you saw, that reference
[22:55.200 --> 23:01.320]  display can only keep the brightness up on that image for a very short period of time.
[23:01.320 --> 23:07.520]  The more white that's in that image, it actually has a hardware light that stays green when
[23:07.520 --> 23:13.200]  it's at brightness, and within sometimes seconds, it has to go amber to tell you no longer trust
[23:13.200 --> 23:14.200]  this image.
[23:14.200 --> 23:16.800]  And that's the reference display at $43,000.
[23:16.800 --> 23:23.280]  So we've blown that away at just over a tenth the price.
[23:23.280 --> 23:28.680]  And the message, it seems very clear that it really will enable that in a lot of seriously
[23:28.680 --> 23:32.520]  professional Hollywood pipelines, there's only one of those displays at the end of the
[23:32.520 --> 23:37.200]  chain, and footage comes out of the camera and starts going process, and isn't being
[23:37.200 --> 23:41.920]  looked at, even by these pros, on a true reference display until it gets to the end, and then
[23:41.920 --> 23:43.560]  all of a sudden you're like, hey, your shirt's the wrong color.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.560]  Yeah.
[23:44.560 --> 23:45.560]  What are you doing?
[23:45.560 --> 23:46.560]  Totally true.
[23:46.560 --> 23:47.700]  Now everybody in the workflow can have one.
[23:47.700 --> 23:51.680]  So we're super proud of the work our engineers did on that.
[23:51.680 --> 23:52.680]  It's incredible.
[23:52.680 --> 23:53.680]  All right.
[23:53.680 --> 23:54.680]  Let's talk software.
[23:54.680 --> 24:02.600]  All right.
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.600]  Mac OS Catalina.
[24:03.600 --> 24:05.280]  Let's just go Mac to Mac.
[24:05.280 --> 24:07.960]  We'll go hardware to software.
[24:07.960 --> 24:10.440]  Same thing we did in the keynote, by the way.
[24:10.440 --> 24:14.960]  I know I'm going to misspeak here, because the way my brain works, it's like a hashing
[24:14.960 --> 24:16.040]  algorithm.
[24:16.040 --> 24:21.700]  I'm going to confuse catalyst with Catalina probably every time I say it, but I'll try
[24:21.700 --> 24:27.500]  to keep it straight.
[24:27.500 --> 24:31.200]  I think this was the order you introduced, where you talked about the iTunes, and you
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.120]  had a great segment where you went through the history of iTunes and how simple it was
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.200]  in the early days and how it kept taking on more and more weight.
[24:41.200 --> 24:47.920]  And so now we have music, which is just music, but is born from the roots of what we knew
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.440]  as iTunes with the same playlists and stuff like that.
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.440]  Super fast.
[24:53.440 --> 25:03.960]  A podcast app, which is written using catalyst, and the TV app.
[25:03.960 --> 25:06.080]  Is the TV app a catalyst app as well?
[25:06.080 --> 25:07.080]  No.
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.080]  No.
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.920]  Of those three, just podcasts.
[25:10.920 --> 25:13.880]  Of those three, just podcasts.
[25:13.880 --> 25:20.360]  And I will say, I have not installed it, so I can't say that using it does, but getting
[25:20.360 --> 25:27.400]  a demo and seeing it, the podcast app looks like the sibling to the music app.
[25:27.400 --> 25:31.920]  In terms of the concerns that I've had, I know that other people have had, that what
[25:31.920 --> 25:38.400]  we now know as catalyst wasn't going to let you make apps that look like a real Mac app.
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.280]  And I don't think that's true at all, at least in what we see now this year.
[25:42.280 --> 25:43.280]  Oh, sure.
[25:43.280 --> 25:46.960]  No, I mean, catalyst certainly, well, it's UIKit API, so you've got a UI view instead
[25:46.960 --> 25:47.960]  of an NS view.
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.280]  I mean, it's a fully native framework, and we have an appropriate set of controls, and
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.640]  you can take advantage of all the platform features to build a really distinctive experience.
[25:56.640 --> 26:02.200]  So it's definitely the case that if you just push the Mac button in Interface Builder and
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.880]  build the app, that you're going to get some degree of Mac-ification, but it really is
[26:07.880 --> 26:15.240]  for developers to take some care to do the design work to make a great Mac experience.
[26:15.240 --> 26:19.160]  But you don't have to at least rewrite all of your code in order to do that, so you can
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.440]  have one code base and one team who understands one set of frameworks to do that work.
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.560]  But it's a parallel native framework set for the Mac.
[26:30.560 --> 26:37.280]  Can you, like let's say you have an iOS app, and you click the checkbox, add it to Mac,
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.320]  and then you spend some time really Mac-ifying it and doing things that only make sense on
[26:42.320 --> 26:44.880]  the Mac or should be different on the Mac.
[26:44.880 --> 26:53.460]  Can you also call into AppKit, or if you're a catalyst app, you're in UIKit, and there's
[26:53.460 --> 26:54.460]  like a boundary?
[26:54.460 --> 26:56.040]  Yeah, I mean, there's some indirect ways.
[26:56.040 --> 27:00.360]  Like if you have a separate window in the app, and that's Inspector Palette or some
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.320]  other part of your app that you want to use AppKit, you can.
[27:03.320 --> 27:06.840]  You can't blend in the same view hierarchy, both those technologies.
[27:06.840 --> 27:10.840]  They run in the same process today, which is different, as I know some people who've
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.480]  done some teardowns of last year's technology, they ran in.
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.800]  Thank you.
[27:21.800 --> 27:24.120]  Now it's one process model, so it's much, much tighter integration.
[27:24.120 --> 27:26.840]  But still, it's not a blended view hierarchy, but if you have different parts of your app,
[27:26.840 --> 27:27.840]  you could write them.
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.800]  But in loose terms, similar to in the old days when you could have a Cocoa app that
[27:31.800 --> 27:34.440]  called out the carbon APIs in a certain way.
[27:34.440 --> 27:48.520]  I'm not comfortable with that analogy.
[27:48.520 --> 27:54.800]  Design wise, I'm really happy to see some color coming back into the interface, sidebar
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.800]  items with color.
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.240]  I know design trends, like any kind of fashion, they all go through cycles.
[28:03.240 --> 28:09.960]  But I feel like the monochrome, overreliance on the monochrome look just kind of got old.
[28:09.960 --> 28:16.080]  I don't know, there's a cheerfulness to all of the OSs that I think came out on Monday
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.080]  that I appreciate.
[28:17.080 --> 28:18.080]  Oh, good.
[28:18.080 --> 28:24.720]  I think there's a tension between deference to the main content of the window and that
[28:24.720 --> 28:26.000]  kind of cheerfulness that you described.
[28:26.000 --> 28:34.480]  And in the case of the media apps, the content in the main part of the window is itself super
[28:34.480 --> 28:35.480]  commanding.
[28:35.480 --> 28:40.160]  And so actually having a colorful sidebar doesn't really compete.
[28:40.160 --> 28:42.120]  The finder is a little bit of a different case, right?
[28:42.120 --> 28:46.400]  Where the main content of the window, if you have a list view or something, you can really
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.560]  have your attention drawn to a bright sidebar versus the content in the window.
[28:51.560 --> 28:54.960]  But you're right, this is something where I think our experience and our tastes evolve
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.240]  over time.
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.300]  And I feel like there's a nice growing visual symbiosis between iOS and Mac OS.
[29:04.300 --> 29:10.920]  And I know that they've looked related for a while, but there's something about this
[29:10.920 --> 29:13.640]  year's releases that to me feels a little bit more coherent.
[29:13.640 --> 29:18.760]  And maybe I'm reading into a little bit too much with things like Catalyst and knowing
[29:18.760 --> 29:26.160]  that the podcast app literally shares source code with the iOS version.
[29:26.160 --> 29:29.960]  But they feel like they're of a family in a way that even more than ever.
[29:29.960 --> 29:35.660]  Yeah, and I think that's when we first released the first set of apps that used the Catalyst
[29:35.660 --> 29:40.760]  technology last year, some of the concerns that were voiced by members of the Mac community
[29:40.760 --> 29:47.980]  such as yourselves, placed a certain amount on the technology that was really some design
[29:47.980 --> 29:49.520]  decisions we'd made.
[29:49.520 --> 29:51.760]  So there's certainly some things that were underlying technology behaviors, but there
[29:51.760 --> 29:56.400]  were other just pure design choices about sizes of items in the sidebar and where was
[29:56.400 --> 30:02.160]  the search field and all of those kinds of things that were different design teams pushing
[30:02.160 --> 30:08.680]  the bounds of what is the right future for a media-oriented design on the Mac.
[30:08.680 --> 30:10.580]  And some people said, oh my gosh, there's this new app.
[30:10.580 --> 30:11.580]  It has this new design.
[30:11.580 --> 30:13.800]  Oh, and it's built using this technology.
[30:13.800 --> 30:15.680]  That must be a byproduct of the technology.
[30:15.680 --> 30:17.680]  In fact, those were design decisions.
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.400]  And I think we're finding our balance now, pulling back in a couple areas there.
[30:21.400 --> 30:25.960]  And the underlying technology is much refined now this year.
[30:25.960 --> 30:30.560]  And they really are true Mac apps.
[30:30.560 --> 30:33.680]  You don't have to distribute them through the Mac App Store.
[30:33.680 --> 30:35.520]  Same rules as I was going to say.
[30:35.520 --> 30:37.000]  Yeah, that's an implementation choice.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.640]  Which frameworks you want to use to build your app is really just an implementation
[30:41.640 --> 30:44.320]  detail as far as the platform's concerned.
[30:44.320 --> 30:50.120]  If you want a note, I believe it was you, but see, I think you scared people on stage
[30:50.120 --> 30:55.820]  Monday because you introduced Kat.
[30:55.820 --> 30:59.800]  And then you said, we look forward to seeing your great apps in the Mac App Store.
[30:59.800 --> 31:00.800]  And I feel like—
[31:00.800 --> 31:01.880]  You always got to say that story.
[31:01.880 --> 31:06.320]  I know, right.
[31:06.320 --> 31:07.320]  And we do.
[31:07.320 --> 31:09.320]  We look forward to seeing your great apps in the Mac App Store.
[31:09.320 --> 31:13.000]  But the paranoid among us think, oh, god, they're going to make us go to the Mac App
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.000]  Store.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  But that's not the case.
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  No.
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  Yeah, come on.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.000]  Trust us.
[31:18.000 --> 31:19.000]  Jeez.
[31:19.000 --> 31:31.840]  Another really cool—and seeing it in person and playing with it, it just seems impossibly
[31:31.840 --> 31:33.680]  low latency and sidecar.
[31:33.680 --> 31:38.120]  This is the new feature where you can go up to your display menu on your Mac.
[31:38.120 --> 31:43.600]  And if you have an iPad tied to your iCloud account, it'll show up as a target, and
[31:43.600 --> 31:44.600]  you can select it.
[31:44.600 --> 31:52.560]  The iPad will spring to life and show up as a second display on your Mac, wired or wirelessly,
[31:52.560 --> 31:54.240]  with extremely low latency.
[31:54.240 --> 31:59.600]  And it lets you use the pencil as an input in any Mac app that already supports the long-standing
[31:59.600 --> 32:00.600]  tablet—
[32:00.600 --> 32:01.600]  Drawing tablet.
[32:01.600 --> 32:02.600]  Yeah.
[32:02.600 --> 32:03.600]  Yeah.
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.600]  Yeah.
[32:04.600 --> 32:05.600]  Yeah.
[32:05.600 --> 32:06.600]  Yeah.
[32:06.600 --> 32:07.600]  Yeah.
[32:07.600 --> 32:08.600]  Yeah.
[32:08.600 --> 32:09.600]  Yeah.
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.600]  Yeah.
[32:10.600 --> 32:11.600]  Yeah.
[32:11.600 --> 32:12.600]  Yeah.
[32:12.600 --> 32:13.600]  We agree.
[32:13.600 --> 32:14.600]  It's awesome.
[32:14.600 --> 32:15.600]  Yeah.
[32:15.600 --> 32:16.600]  No argument here.
[32:16.600 --> 32:17.600]  Yeah.
[32:17.600 --> 32:20.600]  There's some interesting decisions there where, on the sidecar interface, at the bottom
[32:20.600 --> 32:27.920]  what you get is a virtual—the same buttons you would get if you were getting a touch
[32:27.920 --> 32:28.920]  bar.
[32:28.920 --> 32:29.920]  That's right.
[32:29.920 --> 32:31.280]  Even if you're running it on a Mac without a touch bar.
[32:31.280 --> 32:32.280]  That's right.
[32:32.280 --> 32:33.280]  That's right.
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.280]  So whatever your app would have on the touch bar, you have all along the bottom of the
[32:38.280 --> 32:40.800]  iPad app, of the iPad for sidecar.
[32:40.800 --> 32:47.080]  And then on the left side, you have buttons you can use for the command-control-option-shift,
[32:47.080 --> 32:52.320]  so that you can, if you shift to select multiple items, just hold it with your thumb, drag
[32:52.320 --> 32:55.440]  a couple things, select, select, select, and you're doing this.
[32:55.440 --> 32:58.880]  But the main area of the screen is not a touch screen.
[32:58.880 --> 32:59.880]  Yeah.
[32:59.880 --> 33:03.800]  The main area is it takes pencil input, and you can use your mouse or your trackpad and
[33:03.800 --> 33:10.000]  move the mouse over, but you really are using it as a Mac display, not as a touch Mac.
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.000]  Yeah, completely.
[33:11.000 --> 33:16.240]  I mean, we don't think you take an arbitrary Mac user interface with feature sizes and
[33:16.240 --> 33:20.560]  so forth that were optimized for really precise input, like a mouse, and throw it on a touch
[33:20.560 --> 33:23.800]  screen, that you're going to get a great experience there.
[33:23.800 --> 33:28.320]  So we're making clear that your Mac app is to be used like a Mac app.
[33:28.320 --> 33:32.840]  And yeah, if you have a pencil, that's a really precise instrument, and you can use that.
[33:32.840 --> 33:37.800]  And we really, I mean, it worked out super well that we have so many apps, including
[33:37.800 --> 33:42.840]  a lot of pro apps, that do take advantage of the touch bar to provide the set of controls
[33:42.840 --> 33:47.360]  they thought were really useful for a given context in the app, that we could put, you
[33:47.360 --> 33:52.720]  know, right, that same implementation that the app has done, we could channel right onto
[33:52.720 --> 33:54.720]  your sidecar display.
[33:54.720 --> 34:00.680]  And this is on systems like IMAX and the new Mac Pro where, yeah, you don't have a touch
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.400]  bar, but you take advantage of the developer's work there in a context that makes a ton of
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.400]  sense.
[34:05.400 --> 34:06.400]  It works really well.
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.200]  Yeah, it's really very impressive, speed-wise, and I like it.
[34:11.200 --> 34:18.000]  A huge feature to me, and it just is near and dear to my heart, is the, on the accessibility
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.680]  angle, and Apple has done such a great job with accessibility for as long as I can remember
[34:24.680 --> 34:30.240]  and the current version of Mac OS and iOS lead the industry in accessibility in more
[34:30.240 --> 34:45.560]  ways than we even have time to delineate, but the new voice control stuff, I wasn't
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.480]  at the State of the Union, I was busy with other meetings, but I heard that there were
[34:50.480 --> 34:56.240]  on-stage demos of the voice controls live in the State of the Union, and they taunted
[34:56.240 --> 34:58.520]  the demo gods and survived.
[34:58.520 --> 35:04.380]  Well, there was, I mean, the stage environment is a tough one for voice with reverb and speakers
[35:04.380 --> 35:08.520]  and all of that, and so there was one word, I think it was like send or something, that
[35:08.520 --> 35:15.820]  was really tough on the mics there, but it works phenomenally well, and I can say we,
[35:15.820 --> 35:24.420]  you know, a few months ago, we had a com meeting for the whole software organization, and someone
[35:24.420 --> 35:32.840]  came out to demonstrate the use of voice control, and I'm sort of backstage ready to come back
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.360]  out, and I mean, there are friggin' tears in my eyes, you know, I mean, it's one of
[35:36.360 --> 35:43.920]  those technologies, you just see it used, and not only are you just amazed by it, but
[35:43.920 --> 35:51.260]  also just realizing what it can mean to so many people, and thinking about the passion
[35:51.260 --> 35:57.820]  that went into the members of the accessibility team and the Siri team and everyone who pulled
[35:57.820 --> 36:05.720]  that together, it's just awesome, I mean, this is some of the most touching things we
[36:05.720 --> 36:13.380]  do, and so, yeah, I was so happy we were able to really properly show it to the rest of
[36:13.380 --> 36:17.080]  the world in a way that I think conveyed how much it can mean.
[36:17.080 --> 36:25.320]  Yeah, and the movie featured a gentleman who obviously has some motor skill deficiencies,
[36:25.320 --> 36:30.040]  or limits, however you want to say it, but my understanding is, he actually, it wasn't
[36:30.040 --> 36:33.700]  just that you made a movie of him using it, he was actually somebody who you guys consulted
[36:33.700 --> 36:39.040]  with and studied and took feedback from, and he'd say, yeah, but it would be better if
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.840]  this, and it's like, oh, yeah, we could, all right.
[36:41.840 --> 36:52.480]  Absolutely, yeah, and members of our accessibility team, both on the core engineering and QA
[36:52.480 --> 37:01.560]  team and usability team, have themselves a wide range of abilities, and so, we're living
[37:01.560 --> 37:06.640]  this in-house as well, and so these technologies really impact people at Apple who are literally
[37:06.640 --> 37:08.380]  working on the project.
[37:08.380 --> 37:12.960]  One of the demos I saw was of, it was on the Mac, and part of the great thing about this
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.160]  accessibility story with voice control is it is on iOS, too, and I think that's great,
[37:18.160 --> 37:25.000]  and it fits in with this theme I'm trying to have, a recurring theme here, but that
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.960]  I feel like this is one of those things where, even dark mode, dark mode was a last year
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.080]  on the Mac, now it's this year on iOS, this accessibility thing, here it is, they're both
[37:34.080 --> 37:40.200]  on the same day, and it's clearly the same team is making it, because you do it the same
[37:40.200 --> 37:46.800]  way, so for however different Mac and iOS input is using a mouse and keyboard or using
[37:46.800 --> 37:52.520]  a touchscreen, this accessibility stuff is the same, and so developers who can do it
[37:52.520 --> 37:57.160]  on the one platform can transfer that expertise to the other platform and be accessible there
[37:57.160 --> 37:58.160]  in the same way.
[37:58.160 --> 38:03.120]  That's right, and you'd be, I mean, this theme, you're not so subtly setting as a subtext
[38:03.120 --> 38:12.040]  for us all, it is certainly, I mean, if you look at the beginnings of iOS, at the time
[38:12.040 --> 38:19.440]  the iPhone was launched, I mean, getting anything like the core components of Mac OS to run
[38:19.440 --> 38:26.200]  on that hardware, I mean, it would strip everything out, you could minimize and build really optimized
[38:26.200 --> 38:32.600]  pieces to just do what was essential for the phone, but over time, the capabilities of
[38:32.600 --> 38:39.880]  iOS hardware have absolutely become PC class in many ways, and so over time, and this has
[38:39.880 --> 38:45.040]  been a many, many year trend, we've been able to share more and more and more common technology,
[38:45.040 --> 38:48.240]  and that meant both taking some of those great ideas from iOS, bringing them to underlying
[38:48.240 --> 38:51.680]  frameworks of the Mac, but taking some of the power of Mac capabilities, putting them
[38:51.680 --> 38:55.720]  in the underpinnings, and then as you move as high as Catalyst, you see incredible levels
[38:55.720 --> 39:00.080]  of sharing between these frameworks, and that's mirrored what's happened in our organization,
[39:00.080 --> 39:06.000]  so we have one accessibility team, and one team working on voice recognition and these
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.240]  technologies, and so now when we build something like this, we can do one really great focused
[39:10.240 --> 39:13.720]  version and bring it to both platforms.
[39:13.720 --> 39:15.600]  There are cases like dark mode where-
[39:15.600 --> 39:17.600]  All three platforms.
[39:17.600 --> 39:24.320]  You're right, you're right, thank you, Josh, very helpful.
[39:24.320 --> 39:27.000]  This is why we have you here.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.320]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[39:30.320 --> 39:38.680]  Yeah, so we're able to share all this technology, and it's great to then have an organization
[39:38.680 --> 39:42.840]  that builds something like that and can do that, but when it comes to something like
[39:42.840 --> 39:50.320]  dark mode on Mojave, that was a case where having, there are a lot of apps that are distinct
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.120]  to Mojave and distinct to iOS, and being able to have one team, one OS blaze the trail,
[39:56.120 --> 40:00.680]  develop a lot of the patterns and technologies, UI style, et cetera, and then be able to just
[40:00.680 --> 40:06.840]  follow on with what worked on iOS was a great strategy for us this time.
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.240]  I saw a great demo of somebody using the voice control in the Maps app on a Mac, and they
[40:12.240 --> 40:18.160]  turn on the grid, and then they're showing a map, and they said, you know, grid 16, zoom,
[40:18.160 --> 40:24.200]  and then it zooms, and then it's grid 23, zoom, and all I could think of was Blade Runner.
[40:24.200 --> 40:35.400]  It is, like, what I want, I want to be able to set enhance as a synonym for zoom, and
[40:35.400 --> 40:40.600]  it's working, if anything, it's working faster than Blade Runner, because Blade Runner kind
[40:40.600 --> 40:41.600]  of made it like...
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.600]  It didn't have an A12.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.940]  Yeah.
[40:44.940 --> 40:48.240]  It was so slow because they wanted you to see how cool it was, and instead it's like
[40:48.240 --> 40:49.240]  the map is zooming up.
[40:49.240 --> 40:50.240]  I was like, this is amazing.
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.920]  You know, I was a kid, and I thought, man, I hope I live to see something like this.
[40:54.920 --> 40:56.040]  Your life is complete now.
[40:56.040 --> 41:04.600]  We live an interesting time.
[41:04.600 --> 41:06.560]  Swift UI is...
[41:06.560 --> 41:08.560]  Yeah.
[41:08.560 --> 41:13.480]  Thank you, Josh.
[41:13.480 --> 41:19.480]  Going into the show, Josh wasn't sure you guys were going to like it.
[41:19.480 --> 41:29.080]  Wasn't sure it was right to end the show, but boy, it did pretty well.
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.800]  Now is as good a time as any to talk about it after the Mac stuff I had, but one of the
[41:34.800 --> 41:43.240]  fascinating things about it is it goes to four platforms, because it's Mac, it is iPad,
[41:43.240 --> 41:44.240]  it's all...
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.240]  Five, TV.
[41:45.240 --> 41:46.240]  All of them.
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.240]  Everything.
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.600]  iPad, phone, and the first truly native framework for the watch.
[41:51.600 --> 41:58.760]  Right, which is a huge deal.
[41:58.760 --> 42:01.240]  God bless watch kit, but...
[42:01.240 --> 42:06.960]  We'll need to do one of those things with the coffin, I think.
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.320]  Very little coffin.
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.160]  Where's molds when you need them?
[42:17.160 --> 42:18.160]  But this...
[42:18.160 --> 42:25.120]  So, being a native framework for watch OS, are you guys already using it for watch apps
[42:25.120 --> 42:26.600]  that you are making?
[42:26.600 --> 42:27.600]  Yeah.
[42:27.600 --> 42:28.600]  Like some of the new ones?
[42:28.600 --> 42:29.600]  Like...
[42:29.600 --> 42:31.360]  Calculator would be a good example.
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.720]  There are actually several on the system.
[42:32.720 --> 42:38.920]  I think we rewrote an app or two, and then the new things, I think we generally did them
[42:38.920 --> 42:39.920]  in...
[42:39.920 --> 42:46.400]  Which, you know, that's a trailblazing team, because it was certainly a moving target while
[42:46.400 --> 42:52.080]  we've been working on it for years, but as you get late in the game, we start doing a
[42:52.080 --> 42:58.600]  lot of things to make it just right, and that team was agile in adapting to the framework.
[42:58.600 --> 43:05.520]  One thing I've heard from my friends who are developers for years is that from the outside,
[43:05.520 --> 43:12.800]  as third party developers, it shows which APIs you guys are using yourselves and which
[43:12.800 --> 43:13.800]  ones you're not.
[43:13.800 --> 43:18.160]  Because developers like to complain, so maybe it's just one pet framework that's a little
[43:18.160 --> 43:26.280]  weak or something, but it's something developers talk about, and with the watch OS, the technical
[43:26.280 --> 43:31.840]  limitations of the original Apple Watch, and even, you know, it's certainly gotten...
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.480]  The hardware's improved dramatically in just five years.
[43:36.480 --> 43:43.400]  It's understandable why WatchKit was not really a native framework, and that you guys were
[43:43.400 --> 43:49.600]  writing native apps at a technical level, but I think that in terms of really letting
[43:49.600 --> 43:54.040]  the platform blossom, having you guys using the same thing that the developers get to
[43:54.040 --> 43:59.600]  use is gonna really enable third party watch apps to really become something.
[43:59.600 --> 44:00.600]  I think that's right.
[44:00.600 --> 44:06.320]  I mean, there's nothing like the internal feedback loop of your own engineering teams
[44:06.320 --> 44:10.600]  as you're developing the framework saying, this isn't working for me, this doesn't perform
[44:10.600 --> 44:15.760]  well, I can achieve what I need to achieve, having that strong voice in the process and
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.960]  having any limitations of anything that we're in the process of building stand in the way
[44:19.960 --> 44:26.820]  of a strong internal voice, it makes the frameworks better, and that certainly is what we aspire
[44:26.820 --> 44:27.820]  to do.
[44:27.820 --> 44:31.840]  There have been a few cases in our history where that hasn't been it, and I think you're
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.860]  right to observe that we do our best work when it's work we live on.
[44:36.860 --> 44:41.000]  And for watching, you can watch independent apps now, you got the app store on your watch.
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  Yeah.
[44:42.000 --> 44:52.200]  Yeah, which definitely, and again, it's understandable, and the analogy was even made on stage to
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.760]  iPods and even the early iPhone that you, I remember when I got my first iPhone and
[44:56.760 --> 45:00.800]  you took it out of the box, and then you'd have to hook it up to iTunes and wait for
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.960]  AT&T that night to activate your phone, and I sat there all night long waiting for this
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.160]  beautiful device to say something other than waiting for activation, which went through
[45:12.160 --> 45:15.760]  my Mac, which, you know, but it's bootstrapping, right?
[45:15.760 --> 45:16.760]  That's right.
[45:16.760 --> 45:17.760]  Right?
[45:17.760 --> 45:21.640]  And now the watch is taking those same steps where now you've got your own app store.
[45:21.640 --> 45:27.600]  I looked at the app store and I know it sounded a little crazy, but it works.
[45:27.600 --> 45:28.600]  Yeah.
[45:28.600 --> 45:29.600]  Yeah.
[45:29.600 --> 45:30.600]  It does.
[45:30.600 --> 45:31.600]  I hope so.
[45:31.600 --> 45:32.600]  I hope so.
[45:32.600 --> 45:33.600]  I hope so.
[45:33.600 --> 45:34.600]  I hope so.
[45:34.600 --> 45:35.600]  I hope so.
[45:35.600 --> 45:36.600]  I hope so.
[45:36.600 --> 45:37.600]  No, but I mean.
[45:37.600 --> 45:38.600]  It's horrible if we let that on stage.
[45:38.600 --> 45:39.600]  It's horrible if we let that on stage.
[45:39.600 --> 45:40.600]  It's a goal.
[45:40.600 --> 45:41.600]  I mean, it works.
[45:41.600 --> 45:42.600]  It's high praise, John.
[45:42.600 --> 45:43.600]  It's high praise.
[45:43.600 --> 45:44.600]  It's high praise.
[45:44.600 --> 45:45.600]  There's another cool feature.
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.600]  I don't think this made it into the keynote.
[45:46.600 --> 45:50.520]  I guess I'm skipping all over the place here because I want to go back to Swift UI, but
[45:50.520 --> 45:55.600]  the other cool thing in the watch that I saw was that now there's a Safari view, and again
[45:55.600 --> 46:03.680]  you think, what? It goes right to reader mode and just gives you a plain text version of
[46:03.680 --> 46:08.160]  a website right on your watch, which is really kind of useful.
[46:08.160 --> 46:09.160]  Totally.
[46:09.160 --> 46:10.160]  Yeah.
[46:10.160 --> 46:11.160]  Yeah.
[46:11.160 --> 46:14.560]  I mean, you shouldn't read The New Yorker that way.
[46:14.560 --> 46:15.560]  No, no.
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.480]  But I mean, the Safari team has been really creative and pushing on this actually for
[46:22.480 --> 46:28.080]  a couple of years different contexts in which we can apply their technologies, and things
[46:28.080 --> 46:33.080]  that we built for other reasons, like reader mode, suddenly that opens doors to experiences
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.440]  that make sense on the watch, and so yeah, I think it can be really useful for a lot
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.440]  of scenarios.
[46:38.440 --> 46:39.440]  All right.
[46:39.440 --> 46:50.040]  So is there something technical about Swift UI that makes it more efficient or something
[46:50.040 --> 46:56.480]  that justifies it being open to developers to write native apps, or is it just sort of
[46:56.480 --> 47:01.040]  this is the future, we're really proud of this work, we don't want to have baggage,
[47:01.040 --> 47:09.840]  let's just start with this new thing with our first native framework for developers?
[47:09.840 --> 47:11.280]  I would say actually there's a blend of that.
[47:11.280 --> 47:16.840]  The fact that Swift UI is a fundamentally declarative way of writing UI puts the underlying
[47:16.840 --> 47:20.780]  framework in much better control over the how.
[47:20.780 --> 47:25.480]  You specify the what you want, and the framework does a ton to figure out how that happens.
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.000]  It orchestrates all the animations for you, so when it comes to the efficiency of what
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.880]  we can do, it gives us a lot more knobs to deliver a great experience than if you just
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.560]  have pure UI kit.
[47:38.560 --> 47:45.160]  And then there's also that it was able to give us a context to just lay out the pieces
[47:45.160 --> 47:50.360]  of a UI framework that made sense on the watch rather than there's quite a bit of UI kit
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.280]  which under the hood is what we were using sort of an adapted version of on the watch
[47:54.280 --> 48:01.360]  that really weren't appropriate to be public, and this lets us set like this beautiful green
[48:01.360 --> 48:02.360]  field for it.
[48:02.360 --> 48:04.760]  So I think both those factors conspired.
[48:04.760 --> 48:13.360]  And then the fact is also that when we first engineered watch kit, the hardware of the
[48:13.360 --> 48:19.080]  watch, the efficiency of the processor on the watch, the nature of what we could computationally
[48:19.080 --> 48:24.960]  even allow to get you through the day was extremely constrained.
[48:24.960 --> 48:31.480]  And so watch kit was appropriately conservative for us to not create an interface where almost
[48:31.480 --> 48:37.160]  certainly an app that was even just mildly misbehaved could mean it's noon and your
[48:37.160 --> 48:39.280]  watch isn't working anymore.
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.880]  And the hardware has come a long, long way, and that always, as the hardware becomes more
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.320]  capable, that opens up all kinds of doors for us on the software side and to put more
[48:47.320 --> 48:50.040]  tools in the hands of developers.
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.920]  Swift UI feels like the sort of thing that in years past or maybe if just everything
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.200]  hadn't come together and there was fewer other things to announce, like if the Mac Pro
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.360]  hadn't been ready yet or if the Mac Pro had been ready six months ago and had already
[49:02.360 --> 49:04.520]  been out and there was more room in the keynote.
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.840]  It just feels like Swift UI, even in the keynote, not even going to State of Union and really
[49:08.840 --> 49:12.600]  getting into the tech that you can show at the State of the Union, really could have
[49:12.600 --> 49:13.600]  taken up more time.
[49:13.600 --> 49:15.160]  This feels like such a big deal to me.
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.200]  Like I believe your introduction, you said that with Swift UI you were talking about
[49:19.200 --> 49:23.840]  what you said, these sort of transformations and the way developers work only come about
[49:23.840 --> 49:25.560]  every 20 years.
[49:25.560 --> 49:27.400]  20 or 30 years.
[49:27.400 --> 49:28.400]  Truly generational.
[49:28.400 --> 49:29.400]  I mean, yeah.
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.360]  I mean, C was sort of late 60s, early 70s.
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.440]  Objective C was the 80s.
[49:36.440 --> 49:42.720]  And a lot of us are writing code in a language that was created in the 80s.
[49:42.720 --> 49:49.840]  And those technologies, the arc is extremely long because you end up building frameworks
[49:49.840 --> 49:56.440]  that take advantage of the paradigms that those languages allow.
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.600]  You build a whole ecosystem of technologies that go around it, and they have incredible
[50:01.600 --> 50:03.320]  staying power.
[50:03.320 --> 50:08.400]  And so for us, making a decision to go down the road we went down with Swift, this wasn't
[50:08.400 --> 50:11.160]  a little trivial, hey, here's a little thing on the side.
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.720]  This has been a long-term strategy for us.
[50:14.720 --> 50:19.240]  And the implications are, sure, you introduce a new language, and initially you want to
[50:19.240 --> 50:21.400]  make sure it fits in with what's there.
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.840]  Over time, you want to take advantage of it to be everything it can be.
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.000]  And Swift UI is really that step in that evolution.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.680]  I mean, we do see the future of Swift and the set of frameworks that will evolve based
[50:34.680 --> 50:41.840]  on the strengths of Swift to be a generational kind of development for us.
[50:41.840 --> 50:51.780]  And to have the confluence of some great ideas about how to build a declarative UI framework,
[50:51.780 --> 50:56.520]  some of which have roots even going back as far as things we did at Next many, many, many
[50:56.520 --> 51:03.480]  years ago, to having control of a language so you could actually do an extremely concise
[51:03.480 --> 51:09.760]  and expressive declarative syntax for expressing these things, to having awesome control of
[51:09.760 --> 51:12.160]  the developer tools so that you can have an interactive experience.
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.720]  I mean, it takes all of that coming together to create, I think, what has all of us excited
[51:17.720 --> 51:29.280]  about Swift UI.
[51:29.280 --> 51:32.960]  I mentioned earlier talking about icons, that fashion trends change over years.
[51:32.960 --> 51:37.400]  But other development trends change, too.
[51:37.400 --> 51:45.480]  When Mac OS X was being birthed after the Next reunification in the late 90s, the whole
[51:45.480 --> 51:51.280]  industry caught a mania for XML, right?
[51:51.280 --> 51:58.000]  And in hindsight, people are like, you know, that's ugly, right?
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.560]  And there's other things over the years, and when computers were much slower in the 80s,
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.100]  there was a reason to use binary formats for files that maybe you shouldn't have.
[52:07.100 --> 52:14.480]  But I feel like we collectively have come back around to the beauty of plain text and
[52:14.480 --> 52:17.360]  the readability of...
[52:17.360 --> 52:22.560]  I'm not a Swift programmer, but I can look at the examples of Swift UI, and I see exactly
[52:22.560 --> 52:23.560]  what it says.
[52:23.560 --> 52:29.680]  It says, you know, dot color or color equals dot blue, and it's very, very readable and
[52:29.680 --> 52:30.680]  concise.
[52:30.680 --> 52:31.680]  The conciseness helps, too.
[52:31.680 --> 52:38.100]  Yeah, and I view our APIs and the syntaxes of our language to be every bit the design
[52:38.100 --> 52:40.360]  exercise of a user interface, right?
[52:40.360 --> 52:46.840]  The way you're gonna express yourself in code should be as refined and thought out as anything
[52:46.840 --> 52:53.720]  else that you're gonna interact with, and code is read much more than it's written.
[52:53.720 --> 52:57.880]  If you can express something concisely and clearly, the next person to look at it's gonna
[52:57.880 --> 52:58.880]  understand it.
[52:58.880 --> 53:05.840]  It's easier for you to maintain and evolve, but doing that well requires not shoehorning
[53:05.840 --> 53:10.600]  a concept on a language that never anticipated it, but having the language and the concept
[53:10.600 --> 53:14.620]  co-evolve, and that's what we were able to achieve.
[53:14.620 --> 53:20.120]  One of the fun things at the keynote is when there's something, the WWC keynote in particular,
[53:20.120 --> 53:24.240]  is when there's something that the developers get, sometimes they call it the back of the
[53:24.240 --> 53:25.240]  room, right?
[53:25.240 --> 53:28.600]  And the back of the room erupts, and the front of the room is just like, what?
[53:28.600 --> 53:29.600]  And one of the...
[53:29.600 --> 53:30.600]  Game controllers?
[53:30.600 --> 53:31.600]  Oh, yeah.
[53:31.600 --> 53:40.400]  That to me was the hidden gem.
[53:40.400 --> 53:43.920]  It's like, wow, the back of the room loves it.
[53:43.920 --> 53:48.000]  I was backstage ready to come out, and I'm like, man, I hope the game controllers isn't
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  what takes the day.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.600]  I go out, and you do SwiftUI, and they're like, well, not quite as much as connecting
[53:54.600 --> 53:57.200]  my old game controller.
[53:57.200 --> 54:05.120]  Well, that was, and it was well ordered, because it was, we have two, we're proud to announce
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.480]  we have two, support for two very popular game controllers, and everybody's like, game
[54:09.480 --> 54:10.480]  controllers.
[54:10.480 --> 54:16.400]  And then the first one's Xbox, and people applaud it, but then the applause started
[54:16.400 --> 54:19.280]  rising already, because they're like, wait, no.
[54:19.280 --> 54:20.840]  What can number two be?
[54:20.840 --> 54:21.840]  Right.
[54:21.840 --> 54:24.440]  And then when they said PS4, the room truly erupted.
[54:24.440 --> 54:31.720]  I mean, no offense to our friends at Microsoft, but it really seems like this is a PlayStation
[54:31.720 --> 54:32.720]  crowd.
[54:32.720 --> 54:33.720]  Yes.
[54:33.720 --> 54:38.000]  I think people were happy with both of them, John.
[54:38.000 --> 54:46.720]  Both of our valued partners were appreciated by our audience.
[54:46.720 --> 54:55.760]  One last semi-technical question about SwiftUI is it sounds to me, from what I've read and
[54:55.760 --> 55:01.040]  what people have dug into it, it is definitely way more significant.
[55:01.040 --> 55:06.320]  It's not a thin wrapper around UIKit and AppKit.
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.120]  But it might, in some places, fall back, and that the, more or less, the implementation
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.640]  details of views are internal, and developers don't have to worry about it.
[55:16.640 --> 55:23.080]  Just follow the API, and behind the scenes, maybe it'll fall back to UIKit or AppKit.
[55:23.080 --> 55:26.680]  Maybe it'll be something new that's implemented right in SwiftUI.
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.680]  Don't worry about it.
[55:27.680 --> 55:28.680]  It's a black box.
[55:28.680 --> 55:32.960]  That's right, because a lot of times, you end up having to use views in the past to
[55:32.960 --> 55:37.920]  achieve layout grouping and so forth, and then you're getting overhead you don't really
[55:37.920 --> 55:38.920]  need.
[55:38.920 --> 55:42.480]  So it gives you views that make a ton of sense from a control point of view.
[55:42.480 --> 55:48.440]  So SwiftUI is able to make that choice in a way that does the most efficient thing but
[55:48.440 --> 55:50.120]  gives you all the capability you need.
[55:50.120 --> 55:58.480]  It certainly was a hard goal from the outset that we know our developers have an investment
[55:58.480 --> 56:01.040]  in custom controls they've created.
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.560]  They want to be able to build SwiftUI around a control they have.
[56:06.560 --> 56:10.800]  They want to be able potentially to create a component in SwiftUI that fits inside the
[56:10.800 --> 56:17.120]  context of an app that has a traditional AppKit or UIKit view hierarchy.
[56:17.120 --> 56:24.000]  And so making those worlds completely interoperate was critical, and that's going to make it
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  really easy to adopt.
[56:25.000 --> 56:30.600]  And it also means all the frameworks we've built and you've built become accessible in
[56:30.600 --> 56:31.600]  this world.
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.640]  I don't know if you've gone through the really excellent SwiftUI tutorials, but yeah, isn't
[56:36.640 --> 56:42.960]  that I think the doc team, I mean, they knocked it out of the park on this.
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.600]  And if you go through that, at one point they're like, hey, let's use a map, let's use MapKit.
[56:47.600 --> 56:53.560]  There's no custom work that we did to integrate MapKit into SwiftUI, but it's nearly effortless
[56:53.560 --> 57:00.280]  for you to take that existing massive investment in this UIKit control and incorporate it into
[57:00.280 --> 57:01.480]  a SwiftUI app.
[57:01.480 --> 57:08.440]  So I think that's going to be huge for everyone who wants to adopt the technology.
[57:08.440 --> 57:15.200]  The other big back of the room applause moment was during the demo when it was shown how
[57:15.200 --> 57:22.560]  easy it is to get the UI you're working on running on an actual voice, and you just select
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.360]  the word gray and type B-L-U-E, and on the phone the button changes from gray to blue.
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.240]  The back of the room erupted, and the front of them was like, what?
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.120]  Of course it changed to blue, you typed blue.
[57:37.120 --> 57:38.120]  Right?
[57:38.120 --> 57:44.420]  Was I that obvious?
[57:44.420 --> 57:52.880]  It's like you had to have experience going through the build, install, launch cycle,
[57:52.880 --> 57:57.960]  and then you realize, and especially in the earlier days of iOS development when everything
[57:57.960 --> 58:01.560]  was a little slower, computers were slower, and Xcode was slower, and the transfer might
[58:01.560 --> 58:05.400]  have been a little slower, and the phones were slower, and then you're like, ah, shit,
[58:05.400 --> 58:09.180]  I was supposed to change the color to blue, I forgot.
[58:09.180 --> 58:10.180]  Right?
[58:10.180 --> 58:15.320]  One of my coworkers was saying, she talked to her mom, and her mom and dad had sat down
[58:15.320 --> 58:19.360]  and watched the keynote, and she's talking to her mom, and her mom says, there was this
[58:19.360 --> 58:25.160]  point when dad just kept yelling at the TV, oh my god, oh my god, you know, she's like,
[58:25.160 --> 58:32.240]  I'm not sure what was happening, but it really seemed to speak to him, and he was an engineer.
[58:32.240 --> 58:36.920]  So, yes, there are things that if you've ever gone through the normal cycle, you realize
[58:36.920 --> 58:42.680]  that if you can iterate that fast, that you're just going to pursue more ideas, you're going
[58:42.680 --> 58:46.840]  to try more things, you're going to end up with a better result, you're going to be more
[58:46.840 --> 58:52.640]  creative, and so accelerating that cycle is so important, and that really did take the
[58:52.640 --> 58:57.640]  work between the compiler team, the IDE team, the language, the way the frameworks work,
[58:57.640 --> 59:01.480]  to achieve what in the end should feel, oh yeah, it should work that way.
[59:01.480 --> 59:10.360]  But I got to say, as we did preview this for some members of the front of the room internally,
[59:10.360 --> 59:17.320]  I think there was a degree as we're going through it, except for JAWS, of nodding, because
[59:17.320 --> 59:20.320]  they're, like you said, they're looking at the code, and they're going, I think for the
[59:20.320 --> 59:27.520]  first time, I understand what looks like code, so that was a good sign, right.
[59:27.520 --> 59:30.160]  I think I know how I could change that to red.
[59:30.160 --> 59:31.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[59:31.720 --> 59:35.560]  I can do that.
[59:35.560 --> 59:40.520]  Well, I'm so happy that this shipped.
[59:40.520 --> 59:44.400]  I was asked earlier today, what is my favorite announcement so far.
[59:44.400 --> 59:45.400]  I'm not even a developer.
[59:45.400 --> 59:46.400]  I just think it's very cool.
[59:46.400 --> 59:47.400]  I can't wait to dig into it.
[59:47.400 --> 59:49.680]  I think SwiftUI is my favorite software.
[59:49.680 --> 59:50.680]  Right.
[59:50.680 --> 59:51.680]  Hi.
[59:51.680 --> 01:00:09.200]  So, tvOS has multi-user support now at a new control center, which is how you change users.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:18.920]  Are there any other platforms that you think could use multi-user support?
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.560]  Is the tv not enough for you, John?
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560]  Yeah, geez.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560]  None that I can think of.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.560]  The tv is meant for it, right.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.240]  You sit in a family, you sit in a couch, you have different people who use that same tv,
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.600]  come on, it's perfect.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.800]  Everyone should buy their own devices.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:44.200]  Yeah, I'm trying to think what other devices families might have in their living room that
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.480]  other people use, but I'm drawing a blank.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]  No.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480]  Thank you.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.800]  You can do multi-user with iPad and education.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.800]  Don't forget that.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]  It works actually.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800]  It works great.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:03.440]  I see Michael Chow in the crowd cheering.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.560]  Is it a coincidence?
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.680]  Is it a coincidental timing that this is the year where you support Xbox and PlayStation
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.600]  game controllers and it's also the year when Apple Arcade is coming in the fall?
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600]  It's probably not.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.600]  I mean.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]  You're saying is that coincidental?
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600]  Is it coincidental?
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.760]  No, I think it makes a lot of sense, yeah.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.560]  These things don't happen on accident.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.360]  There are a lot of games there that are going to play great with a controller.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.360]  I think we want to make sure we have the best people.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.120]  Apple Arcade and here's some new game controllers.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.640]  It was like we connected those two concepts.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  We tried our best.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640]  I mean, that was marketing.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.160]  I was going to say we're moving fast, but that's tiff's part.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.600]  To that point, to your point, we could spend longer on these things.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.200]  We could spend longer on everything.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.120]  When we first put these keynotes together, they're about three hours.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.560]  There's another company in our neighborhood who tried that a couple of times.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.220]  It doesn't go over well.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.240]  We try to keep it around 215, give or take, which we've run the last few years at.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.040]  We figure that's as long as we can go.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.480]  We run things down to the minute.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.920]  When we're creating slides, we have to figure out how many roughly slides can we create
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.480]  so we get in a ballpark of knowing how much time.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:21.600]  What our MarCom team has done a brilliant job of is they have mapped every presenter
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.960]  over the years and how many slides they can do a minute.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.720]  It's like a baseball card.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:34.120]  It's like a... I won't out the slower people, but the fastest one by far.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:45.880]  I give them a little bit of grief because in his prime, Craig could do nine slides a
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]  minute.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.560]  He slowed down to about seven slides a minute as he's getting a little older, but I think
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.840]  he still does a pretty good job.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.040]  I feel like you guys have been holding me back lately.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.800]  We get out of rehearsal like we did not see the image on the screen.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.600]  You can't just yell a word and push next.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:12.920]  Actually, I think we'd all agree, he does a brilliant job up there.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:24.840]  I don't know why I never asked this before.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.280]  Do you guys click the slides yourselves?
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.280]  Yes.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.280]  I know you always... That's a thing I'm doing.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.080]  You have to, right?
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.080]  It would be freaky to have someone else do it.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.280]  That did happen in rehearsal at one point.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.280]  We had something where we're out there and then someone backstage is pushing the button.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.280]  Tim is like, what's going on with my slides?
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.280]  They're moving forward.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.280]  After rehearsal, Kevin Lynch admitted he was backstage playing with the clicker.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.800]  What does this thing do?
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.280]  They are live clickers, yes.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.280]  All right, let's go.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.280]  IOS 13.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280]  Yes.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.280]  What can you tell me about this new packaging format that makes downloads smaller?
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.280]  I kind of could get so that you could do something on the server side and take out resources.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:18.280]  If you're running on a 2X retina device, you could take out 3X resources or something and
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  do something.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280]  But the apps launch twice as fast?
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]  Yeah, isn't that crazy?
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.280]  That was quite a discovery for us.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:32.280]  Sometimes you just stumble into something and you take it.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.280]  Just kidding.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:45.280]  It turns out that over time, in terms of the way the apps were encrypted and the way FairPlay
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:53.280]  worked and so forth, the encryption became part of the critical path, actually, of launching
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280]  the apps.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.280]  I mean, the processors are capable of ripping through the thing that actually was a problem.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.280]  Then there are other optimizations that, based on what was visible to the system at certain
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.280]  points, we couldn't prebind certain things.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.280]  So, it actually cut out optimization opportunities.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.280]  So, when we really identified that opportunity, we said, okay, well, we can actually come
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.280]  up with a better format that's going to eliminate that being on the critical path.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.280]  It's going to enable all these prebinding things.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.280]  Then we did a whole bunch of other work to optimize the Objective-C runtime, to optimize
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.280]  the dynamic linker, a bunch of other things.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.280]  You put it all together and, yeah, the cold launch, we've never had a win like this to
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.280]  launch time in a single release.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]  So, it's fantastic.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.280]  I can't wait for those videos where people do this.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]  Those videos.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.280]  Like, that defines the performance of a phone, right?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280]  They're like, watch this.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.280]  This is what you do all day.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:57.280]  Okay, we'll win one of those.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:03.280]  Which phone is faster?
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.280]  Sorry, if you're in the audience, whoever that dude is.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.280]  Wait till they write about you tomorrow.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.280]  You know, I've watched those videos.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.280]  I've watched those videos, too, and then you watch them, and then sometimes you look over
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.280]  on the side and they show you in the sidebar other videos from the same creator, and it's
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.280]  like, oh, my God, this guy makes one of these every week with the other phone.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280]  And it's like, oh, my God, once a week he's doing this thing.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280]  That's his thing.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]  He's the guy.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.280]  Kind of like, will it blend?
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:44.280]  The Photos app clearly has a major upgrade for iOS this year.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:51.280]  It just has to be among the most used apps on the platform in the world.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:57.280]  I mean, it's a real problem, exactly as pitched on stage.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.280]  All right, now you've had this phone for all these years, and you've maybe had other digital
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.280]  cameras, and you've put them in your same iCloud photo library, and you've got, I don't
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.280]  know, I've got like 28,000 items in my iCloud photo library.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280]  Something like that.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280]  I don't know.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280]  It's ridiculous.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]  How do you surface them?
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280]  How do you surface them?
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:23.280]  And I really, really think that this month, year interface to collecting these things
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.280]  really seems smart.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:33.280]  And this is an instance where the big bet you guys have made on machine learning in
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  recent years on device is really showing its effects, because it's not just collecting
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280]  them by month.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280]  That's easy.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.280]  It's this, here's the best ones.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.280]  Here's three that are almost exactly the same.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.280]  We'll just show one for now so that you're not seeing it all.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.280]  And that's all through the machine learning.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280]  Yeah.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.280]  This is another one where we're in the meeting, and Justin TD.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280]  This was his real photo library.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280]  Which was awesome.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.280]  I don't know if you guys noticed that in the keynote.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:10.280]  I think the fact that Justin and his entire family are gingers helped.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.280]  They were like, we have no understudy for this.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.280]  We've got nobody.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:21.280]  But he obviously is a member of the, leader of the photos team takes a lot of pictures.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.280]  And as a proud father, obviously takes an unbelievable number of photos.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.280]  But he's there demoing it and going through it.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:34.280]  And he starts paging back through the life of his child going backwards.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.280]  And we're all sitting here trying to avoid looking at each other, because we're tearing
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]  up.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:47.280]  I mean, and I had, I literally had that experience myself, where I opened it, and I'm seeing
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.280]  like my children, and I go back and back, and then I have two of them, and then there's
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  one of them, and then there's my wife and I at the altar.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  It was crazy.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:05.280]  And you just never have those experiences in this just sea of photos.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:13.280]  But the team has gotten so much more advanced over the last several years in not just saying
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.280]  what's a good photo.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.280]  That's a piece of it.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.280]  What's a good photo?
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.280]  What's the arc of a meaningful event for you and a story?
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.280]  And then looking at across big spans of time.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.280]  What were big events that were important to you?
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:34.280]  I mean, intuiting all of that is an art and one that, yes, if we were all to do that,
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.280]  then maybe back in the old days with iPhoto, you'd go try to tag things and organize
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.280]  and build the albums.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.280]  Like, you might have done it, but now we're taking so many more photos.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.280]  It's just totally impractical.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]  And you get it for free.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:54.280]  And then I think, like many of us, my wife must wonder when suddenly she gets these flurry
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.280]  of iMessage photos from our past and our children coming at her.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.280]  And it's because I'm using the app, and I'm literally like rediscovering my photo
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.280]  library and going, oh, my god, this is so great and sharing.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.280]  And it has that effect on you.
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.280]  And it's the toughest feature in some ways.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.280]  I mean, I hope the demo came across, but it's in a way the toughest feature to really
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:20.280]  get across the meaning because you have to see it with your own photos because suddenly
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.280]  that all becomes, you're like, oh, my god, this is it for me.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.280]  You see someone else's photos, you're like, nice family, Justin.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.280]  But other than that, it's like, I don't know, but the emotional resonance of your
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280]  own photos, it's incredible.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.280]  Justin did a brilliant job, too.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  And it was touching because Craig's exactly right.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280]  When you put your own photos in this is when you melt.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.280]  But I thought that came across still in Justin's demo really well because, you know, I mean,
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  we do spend so much of our time taking these pictures, and for years people didn't look
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280]  at them, right?
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.280]  And we've given you more ways every year to expose these, including memories, right,
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.280]  that come, you know, it's brilliant.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:59.280]  And it ties back to a question, a topic that you and I have talked about maybe on this
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.280]  stage two years ago, maybe back in San Francisco, but probably more back in San Francisco because
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.280]  I think that was a little bit more, at least from our perspective outside, where you guys
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.280]  really were committing to this machine learning and becoming best of industry at AI stuff.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:22.280]  And there's a strong sentiment held by many people out there that this on-device strategy
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.280]  is doomed to failure because there's other companies that do it all in the cloud, and
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.280]  theirs works, and so therefore the cloud is the only way to make it work.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.280]  And you and Phil, when he's been here, I've asked this question.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:39.280]  Are you convinced that this on-device, let the billion iPhones out there do this machine
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.280]  learning in a distributed fashion on all of this amazing hardware that's out there being
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.280]  used?
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280]  Are you committed to it?
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.280]  Oh, totally.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:55.280]  And in fact, if you watch recent events from our, the other guys, you'd be surprised how
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.280]  many times they've started to say on-device machine learning.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.280]  I mean, they're actually seeing the light a little bit on that topic.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  But I think they're disadvantaged in the sense that part of what makes this possible is building
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  great hardware and having a consistent baseline of great hardware that's capable of this.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.280]  And the integration of that hardware and software.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.280]  And the integration of the hardware and the software, because if you have to try to pull
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  this off over this random fleet of different devices of different capabilities, it's really
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.280]  tough to provide a decent experience.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:35.280]  And you look at the A&E in the most recent iPhones, it's astounding what you have to
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:44.280]  work with there and how they can just, what they can do with processing photos on device,
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.280]  even doing the kind of voice synthesis that you saw with the neural TTS.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280]  We can do that on the A&E.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  It's just incredible where you're actually generating literally through a network every
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  sample in the waveform of the voice is being, you know, sort of hallucinated in real time
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.280]  out of the network.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  And it's, yeah, it's incredible.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.280]  So, yeah, this stuff has legs.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.280]  Yeah, it really is starting to show.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.280]  And you're starting to see it in other places too, like in the sharing sheets where the
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.280]  sharing sheets now have recommended guesses as to who you might want to send this to.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.280]  And how.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.280]  And how you want to send it.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280]  Yeah, I'm going to make that clear.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.280]  But, you know, maybe you often, with this kind of content, you email it to this person,
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:35.280]  you iMessage it to this person, you WeChat it to this person, and that combination is,
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  you know, one tap.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.280]  And that makes a huge difference just in terms of your desire to think like, hey, I'm going
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.280]  to do this because it's going to be fast and easy.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.280]  And it turns out we can do a really great job figuring out where you're going to share
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  with.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.280]  Yeah, and in some ways being local has advantages where the iOS knows which apps you're using.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.280]  You know, the operating system on your device knows that you use WeChat.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280]  Right.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.280]  Right.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  The cloud doesn't know what you do on your phone.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.280]  Yeah, and honestly, having your device know you is cool.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:21.280]  Having some cloud person know you is creepy.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  iPadOS, we have a new OS.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  Michael goes crazy, starting to wave out there.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.280]  Tell me the thinking, why change the name to iPadOS now?
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.280]  What pushed it over the edge in 2019?
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.280]  Yeah, and I'll say this one, even though it's a marketing thing, I think engineering.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:54.280]  I mean, marketing gets to name things at Apple, but engineering felt very strongly on this
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:15:05.280]  one because we have, I mean, we've been on this trajectory for the iPad from the outset
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.280]  co-evolving with this incredibly, the hardware has been incredibly more and more advanced
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.280]  over time and has been enabling more and more software experiences.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.280]  To that point, our worst nightmare was it's a big iPod touch.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]  Right.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280]  Right.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.280]  That was never the iPad experience.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.280]  No, and in fact, from a UI design perspective, the very first iPad had these incredibly distinct
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.280]  experiences visually and taking advantage of the canvas at the time, but as the experience
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:38.280]  went on and we started saying, well, what do you want to do with a device that has these
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:42.280]  kinds of characteristics?
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.280]  What's the right kind of interaction model?
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.280]  Things like split view and slide over and drag and drop and Apple pencil started to
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:56.280]  be a factor, and then you start to see Apple and third party developers really start to
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.280]  take advantage of that and tailor the experience.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:03.280]  When we think about a platform, when you think about a name, what makes TV OS TV OS?
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.280]  I mean, under the hoods, there's a lot of iOS in there.
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.280]  Why don't we call that like iOS for TVs or something like that?
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.280]  Well, because it defines an experience, right?
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.280]  TV OS means there's a 10-foot experience.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.280]  Watch OS means it's an experience optimized for your wrist.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:24.280]  iPad OS has evolved to have an experience that has its own distinct nature to the point
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:30.280]  that it deserved to be recognized in that way, and when you put some of the next set
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:36.280]  of changes that, you know, along the path that we are steadily on, we felt like we just
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:42.280]  crossed to the point where it was just silly to no longer say this is its own thing.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.280]  Sure, technically it shares all these underpinnings, but fundamentally we're communicating
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.280]  to users, there's a distinctive experience here, and we're communicating to developers.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:54.280]  Like, if you build an iPad app, you should support, if you're a document-based app,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.280]  you should support multiple windows.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280]  You should support drag and drop.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.280]  That's what it means to be a great iPad OS app.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:07.280]  Well, and I think it was a good reminder, at least a lot of the coverage, that a lot
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.280]  of the coverage today was very positive on iPad OS and a reminder that the other guy's
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.280]  tablet experience really isn't a tablet experience, right?
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.280]  It was nothing but big phone experience, and that's a huge advantage for iPad.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.280]  It is a real experience that is very distinct and unlike anything in the industry.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:34.280]  And what struck me from a lot of the demos, not just, like, Notes and Mail, but even,
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:43.280]  like, the Microsoft Office iPad apps, is that 2UP is sort of a magic number, you know?
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.280]  Like, one, you know, like, the iPhone has always been a single-screen device.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.280]  You launch an app, it gets the whole screen, and the iPad started that way and has sort
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.280]  of evolved with more multitasking screen arrangements.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.280]  But 2 is sort of a magic number.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.280]  Like, the old version and the new version, you want them side by side, you know, and,
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.280]  you know, like, so it hasn't evolved in a way.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.280]  It's not, it hasn't ate to the Mac, and you can just hit Command-N 10 times and
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280]  make 10 text edit windows.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280]  Right.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.280]  Not appropriate for the iPad experience and the precision of the control.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.280]  But having 2UP is, it just seems like a huge breakthrough for a lot of use cases.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.280]  Oh, it's a slide over when you need something.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280]  Yeah, it totally is.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.280]  And then, yeah, you want to get at that one extra thing for quick moments.
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.280]  You have slide over.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:32.280]  Yeah, I mean, I think for many of us, really in a very organic way, iPad has become, taken
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.280]  more and more of our time.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:40.280]  And you should have every, again, every device by every one of them and use them for all
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.280]  right jobs.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:48.280]  But iPad is just, it's such a great combination of characteristics for so many activities
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.280]  that, and I think things like split view and slide over make a big difference.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:19:00.280]  I try, I try not to make the mistake of ever telling an engineer, this should be easy,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.280]  you know, with this idea, right?
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.280]  It's just typing.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  I say it all the time.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:14.280]  Now I see SwiftUI, it's not even typing.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:21.280]  But that said, USB drives and SD card support, finally?
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.280]  Well, I think there's more to this than just putting a USB stack in the OS.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  Yeah, sure.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:35.280]  I mean, we, there was.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.280]  You're right.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:46.280]  We, from a security architecture point of view, we did not want to have file system
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:52.280]  drivers running in the kernel, communicating with external media that could be potentially
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.280]  tampered with.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.280]  And that's what you're dealing with when you're talking about plugging in external media into
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  a device like the iPad.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:08.280]  And so getting all of our file systems to be isolated from the kernel, and we didn't
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:14.280]  want to just support, you know, the MS-DOS file system, right?
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.280]  So we wanted APFS support, the whole thing, getting all those file systems in a place
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:25.280]  where they fit with the iOS security architecture and doing the same for SMB and so forth.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.280]  That was a real hardcore engineering effort.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.280]  And so we didn't want to launch it until we could have the complete story and have it
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]  secure in a way that people expect from iOS.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.280]  I'm excited about the fonts.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.280]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.280]  Right?
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.280]  And I mentioned this on my show recently, but I think there's a similar angle there
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.280]  on the security front, which is, and one part of me wants to say, oh, my God, this iPad
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.280]  is so old and it's so beautiful.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.280]  And I can't believe I can't install custom fonts easily yet.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:01.280]  But there is a security angle there because modern fonts, you know, that type, you know,
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:06.280]  open, open, what's the format, open type and true type, they're software programs.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280]  Yeah.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:14.280]  And I'm sure that's part of the thinking of why this was considered for many years
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280]  before we've had this.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:23.280]  Well, having them, certainly you're right that as an attack surface, fonts are something
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:28.280]  that has been exploited over time and one where we put a bunch of effort into hardening.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.280]  But the other factor is being able to have them go through the app store, meaning that
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:38.280]  those fonts aren't something that are going to become an itchy willy nilly is very helpful
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.280]  in this architecture as well.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:51.280]  But I think this was a matter of something that we could have done in the past.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:56.280]  It wasn't that suddenly the stars aligned from a possibility point of view, but from
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.280]  a priority point of view, iPads become more and more device where you're going to be
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.280]  doing those kinds of things and you're going to want that kind of capability.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:09.280]  You know, when you put together things like all the capabilities with files, all the kinds
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:17.280]  of more creation oriented apps that have grown up around iPad, it became, I think, a necessity,
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:19.280]  something we felt we really needed on the platform.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]  Yeah.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.280]  It seems like, again, the keynote was like, we're moving, we're moving.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:31.280]  But it seems to me from getting a little bit of hands on time with it that the, I don't
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.280]  know if it was completely rewritten, but seriously rethought text selection and moving the insertion
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.280]  point and when it's going slow, you're going character by character and you can drag over
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:48.280]  on the, you know, like off the margin and it just goes down to the end of lines and
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:52.280]  it just has so many more useful things and you don't need a magnifying glass anymore
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:58.280]  and you can select like, that seems like that was a big deal and it sort of feels like something
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.280]  that iOS never really got right before.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:08.280]  Like text selection and manipulating the text selection always has felt a little too, more
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.280]  fiddly than it ought to be and I have no idea, you know, had no idea how to fix it, but it
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280]  just felt a little fiddly.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280]  No, we agree.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:24.280]  I think it is one of those areas that in the past you felt like this is harder than doing
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.280]  it on a Mac, right, that I'm using an iPad and I'm feeling like, gosh, I just want to
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.280]  cut and paste something and this is much harder.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.280]  And I think, you know, when we first introduced text selection and copy paste and undo on
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:45.280]  iPhone, yeah, yeah, you know, part of it was just, it was extremely, let's teach you how
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.280]  to do this in a really kind of overt demonstrative way.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.280]  You're going to put your finger down, tap, you're going to get a big magnifying glass,
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.280]  okay, we all get what's going on here.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.280]  I mean, there was almost an instructional element to the interface, but it was also
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:04.280]  very heavy, and so getting to the right solution here, I'll tell you, it was, it's been
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:10.280]  something we have taken runs at for multiple years and come back and felt like we don't
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:15.280]  yet have it, you know, and those are things where you don't just throw it against the
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280]  wall.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.280]  I mean, you do internally you throw it against the wall, but, you know, externally we wanted
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:27.280]  to get it right, and it took a lot of, you know, careful craftsmanship to get it right.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.280]  You know, you're kind of, you have this problem where, okay, I'm going to tap on
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.280]  it, so my finger's now covering the evidence of the thing that I did.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.280]  Where does the cursor go?
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:40.280]  If it hops up above the finger, then it's not where I thought it was.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.280]  If it's under the finger and then I try to move down, well, I never see it.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.280]  And so if you start to study the subtleties of what we had to do to make it feel like,
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  oh, it works like you'd expect, it actually, the mechanics are, you know, pretty, pretty
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  tough.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.280]  But I think, I think we got it.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.280]  And part of that, oh, this might be easier if I go to my Mac.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.280]  Like, cut, copy, paste is one of those things where I'm sure every single person in this
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.280]  room do cut, copy, paste without thinking about what their fingers are doing.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.280]  You just learn to do it, and it, the three finger gestures feel like they, they're
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]  going to get like that.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.280]  If you use your iPad, you're going to just pick that up and you're going to start
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.280]  like, like you're picking up the test.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280]  Yeah.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.280]  And, but my concern, I'm wondering if you're worried, my concern is by being three finger
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.280]  gestures, are you worried that it's a discoverability problem?
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.280]  That, that how are people going to know that they can do these things very easily?
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  It, it might be.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.280]  And, and, but that's why we always provide, I mean, I think command C, you know, heck,
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.280]  I mean, when I send emails, right, it's like command shift D, right?
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.280]  I, I don't, I don't think everyone in my family does command shift D, but I do it
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.280]  a thousand times a day.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.280]  And so, the, it's, it's okay.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:55.280]  Part of what we've given ourselves permission to do over time is to say the iPad experience
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.280]  has to be, you know, the experience that a young child or a first time elderly computer
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  user can walk up to and understand, not get themselves in trouble.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:10.280]  But at the same time, there can be depth to the platform that you can discover and you
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:15.280]  can become a pro and, and really accelerate your work.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.280]  And so, it's, the iPad is perfectly usable to do cut, copy, paste in the traditional
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.280]  way, you know, tap on it, up comes a call out bar, tap copy.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.280]  And we're totally fine with many users doing that, just like we're fine with people
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:36.280]  going up to the edit menu and clicking, you know, and pulling down and doing copy.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  But just like keyboard accelerators, these gestures will become, I think, just complete
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.280]  muscle memory for many of us and, and we'll accelerate what we do.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  Yeah, just a serious reduction in mental friction because you're just doing your thing and
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:50.280]  you're not thinking about it.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.280]  Yeah, and it's funny, you know, we, we tried many different kinds of gestures and some
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:57.280]  of them on paper seem like, oh, well, this is going to be great.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  And it's interesting that just how in your mind it became this idea of I'm almost picking
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  something up to copy and putting it down to paste, we found that people could learn it
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.280]  and perform it much more reliably than a bunch of other gestures.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.280]  And so, funny how the brain works.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.280]  All right, we're getting close to the end, so we've got to enter the speed round.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.280]  Pencil, latency support on the iPad Pro has gone from 20 milliseconds to 9 milliseconds.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.280]  That seems crazy to me in a software update.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.280]  That sounds to me like the pitch from the next iPad Pro, you know, that it's a hardware
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.280]  thing.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.280]  Like, that's, that's a huge reduction.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.280]  That's crazy.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.280]  Yeah.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:43.280]  Well, so there's a piece of it that is optimization and, you know, just scheduling the true motion
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.280]  display, getting in at exactly the right moment to get the draw commands in and recognize
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.280]  the input and so forth.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  And part of it is prediction and it turns out that, you know, the human hand can only
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.280]  accelerate at a certain part.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:57.280]  If you're going to start to turn, you're going to sense the, you know, second derivative
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:01.280]  of motion is going to, you know, so you can, you can actually run, run the math on that.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.280]  And in fact, we, we had one part where we turned the prediction up.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  So instead of trying to guess where you were going to be, it, it, we pushed it way ahead,
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.280]  you know, so it actually predict before it would be running ahead of your pencil.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.280]  And, and if you pushed it far enough, you can just put the pencil down and just write
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.280]  your whole message.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:22.280]  It's very good.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.280]  It's negative latency.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280]  It's, that's next release.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.280]  So you can keep that amongst us, but that's where it's going.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:37.280]  If you're our competitors at this point, ignore everything you heard.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:44.280]  ARKit had a significant amount of time in the demo and ARKit 2 was like a huge upgrade
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  over ARKit 1 and ARKit 3 one year later is all of a sudden occluding people on the device.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.280]  That's a pretty nice applause from the AR developers.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:57.280]  And I've played with it and it is uncanny.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.280]  It is really, really crazy.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.280]  And that's machine learning.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:07.280]  I mean, really the techniques in order to figure out what's a person, where's the person,
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:13.280]  what are these pixels or people pixels is, is a task actually that amazingly with the
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280]  right algorithms and the right training we can do.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280]  And what's, what's incredible is you can, you know, we had some things where we'd like
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.280]  color, you know, color the hand or white color, the color of the person.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:27.280]  And you sort of get it when you, you know, in person would walk out in front and then
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.280]  figure out where the person was.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:32.280]  But when you go like this and you get the tip of your shoe and it goes, that's part
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.280]  of a person, stick a finger in, like it's, it's pretty, it's pretty incredible how
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.280]  it can recognize people parts.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.280]  Don't push it too far.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:51.280]  Don't push it too far.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]  The training set had boundaries.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:59.280]  You know what you've caused a lot of testing, a lot of tests.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:09.280]  All right, Craig, I need you, I'm sorry, damage control.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.280]  I need you to explain to me the difference between AR kit and reality kit.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.280]  Yeah, yeah, they're, they're, they're quite distinct.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:21.280]  So, so reality kit is a full AR oriented 3d rendering engine.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.280]  So, and it's not just a rendering engine, it's a physics engine.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.280]  It does, it's an animation engine.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:35.280]  So it's, it's, it's, and it's actually, it was designed from the outset to be focused
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.280]  on AR.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.280]  So the objective of its rendering techniques are about making things look real.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:46.280]  And part of that are things like, you know, a perfectly rendered object that isn't, that
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.280]  doesn't have the same noise characteristics as what's coming off the camera stands out,
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:51.280]  right?
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:59.280]  If you move and some things are blurring because they're real and the AR object looks strangely
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.280]  fixed there, then it doesn't look real.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.280]  And so we did things like motion blur and noise as part of the rendering.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:14.280]  AR kit is the thing that's providing understanding of the world, the planes in the world doing
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:20.280]  VIO, so understanding between the accelerometers and tracking through the camera textures on
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.280]  the ground and stuff to understand what the geometry of the world is so that a 3d engine
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.280]  like reality kit can go render objects in there.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:33.280]  And the two of them are super tightly integrated because some of what AR kit is perceiving
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.280]  about, for instance, ambient light and understanding that, oh, the way you should be lighting the
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:42.280]  object that you're rendering should take into account all these factors to make it fit in
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]  the real world.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.280]  So the two are really complimentary in that way.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:52.280]  And then reality composer is a 3d creation environment that's kind of, it's sort of interface
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.280]  builder and keynote in 3d.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.280]  So you can lay out all your objects, but then you can also in a keynote sort of fashion
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.280]  easily assign behaviors and animations to them.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.280]  So it makes it very accessible.
[01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:10.280]  The demo I saw of reality composer, again, talk about an app that got short shrift in
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.280]  the keynote.
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.280]  I mean, this app is amazing.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:20.280]  It is like, you know, we, I clearly a lot of work went into this almost certainly years.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:26.280]  I know you guys don't talk about how long, but this is like a full fledged 3d development
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:31.280]  creation app with all the features, you know, you know, if you've used any kind of creation
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:38.280]  app like keynote or, uh, come on, we're not sloppy drinkers here.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.280]  Come on, hold your, hold your beer.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:47.280]  It's a, it's just 1.0 is a really, really rich, deep app.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:56.280]  And in a market where the competing apps like I'm going to Maya and these things are, there's
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:01.280]  literally only like a few thousand people in the world who know how to use them because
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:07.280]  they're so opaque and require, it's like a, you know, airplane flying an airplane.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280]  Yeah.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.280]  These buttons and stuff, you know, it's, and this is, this is a total Apple, the app that
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:17.280]  you can just say like, here, make a thing and make it gold and make it bounce.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.280]  And I mean, the goal, you got it.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.280]  I mean, the goal was to take this thing that was, was pretty arcane and very, very, very
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.280]  specialized skill and say, how do we make this the kind of thing that makes a sophisticated
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:34.280]  3d technology accessible to software engineers and, and designers who aren't 3d experts,
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.280]  but want to incorporate this kind of stuff in their apps.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.280]  And so that was, that was the design goal from the outset.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.280]  And the team did incredible work there.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.280]  And I think, you know, the ability also to do it on the Mac, but not just that, but to
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.280]  then transfer the, to take the experience and do it on your iPad while you're actually
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.280]  experienced in AR, edited in AR, have that sync back automatically to the Mac.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.280]  So you're, you're evolving your project like that.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:07.280]  I think that's going to be a change, change, not just make an existing thing easier, but
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:12.280]  it really even change who can do what in the world of building 3d apps.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.280]  Which is the beauty of AR and AR kit to start with, right?
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.280]  If we opened up AR to a bunch of people, hopefully a bunch of you that never would have done
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280]  AR.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:24.280]  And now they can put AR into their apps.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:30.280]  We have over 7,000 in the app store right now and growing, which is about 7,000 more
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.280]  than there would have been otherwise.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.280]  And what you said about how short it was, I mean, you know, you can imagine the original
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:39.280]  version of the deck had us, you know, spending 15 minutes talking about reality composer
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280]  and another for, you know what?
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:43.280]  And then we got down to where we had a cover slide where we said, it's reality composer.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  And then I have one slide with this animation and, and I had like a few things I was going
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.280]  to say, and we go through rehearsal and I say, reality composer, it's great.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.280]  You can drag and drop and add 3d and Mike Rockwell's like, could you add like four more
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.280]  words about it?
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.280]  I'm like, I got to check with jaws.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:04.280]  He's got a stopwatch out whether they're going to allow these, you know, it's when you have
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:09.280]  that much to talk about, it's, it's, well, I think the great thing is developers are
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280]  all going to follow up.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.280]  You're going to die.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.280]  We have over a hundred sessions at the WWC.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.280]  That's the beauty.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  We have 200 labs, so we have more time to engage with, you know, real engineers on this
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.280]  stuff, but you know, people got to pee so we can.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  We can only keep them there for so long, which I think your audience is starting to experience.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:29.280]  We're getting there.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.280]  Let me just end here.
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:43.280]  Final card is security and privacy related stuff.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.280]  What I hear every company in the Valley is now the protector of your privacy.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280]  It's become a, I don't know.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.280]  It's become a more popular word.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  Isn't it?
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.280]  Including from, from some companies that have said in the past that you have no privacy.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.280]  Like that's an unusual thing to say.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.280]  That makes me uncomfortable.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  The sign in with Apple is a thing that it's an idea that seems kind of obvious and a thousand
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:17.280]  people have had it and they've said,
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.280]  boy, Apple could do that and it would be awesome, but they probably wouldn't do it.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]  And now you've done it.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  And it is a really, it's one, a lot of you guys are the ones that asked us to do it,
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  right?
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.280]  It was developers that were saying, look, you know, we need a frictionless way to authenticate
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.280]  users into our app.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.280]  We don't know what's going on with this data about our customers that were surrendering
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280]  to somebody else.
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  Can you do it and do it in your Apple sort of way?
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  And that's what this team stepped up to do.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  Well, I can't tell you how many times I've downloaded an app.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.280]  It comes up with one of those.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.280]  I close, delete.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.280]  You know, you just never even experienced that.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280]  I've done it.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.280]  I've done it.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  And you know, and, and it is true that once you have it, you can see though what the appeal
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:09.280]  was originally with people using single sign on is that, well, there's so many thousand
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.280]  ways you can screw up security.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.280]  Here's these big companies.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.280]  They've been through it all.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.280]  They've made all the mistakes.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.280]  You can kind of trust them on the security level.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.280]  It's the privacy issue where, you know, trust comes in.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280]  Uh, and it's ease of use, right?
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:25.280]  It's like, here, I'm going to go outside the hall and I'm going to get one of these
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:27.280]  scooters that you can scoot around on.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.280]  And it's like, I've never used it before.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:33.280]  And it's like the law, you know, if I've got to send my email and then wait for the
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:37.280]  email arrive and then the click through the email, it's like, I'm just going to walk,
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.280]  you know, like, you know what I mean?
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:40.280]  Like there's an appeal to that.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  I think that's why one of the scooter companies is one of the demos you guys showed using
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:51.280]  it that you hit sign in with Apple, it face IDs you and now you're scooting.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.280]  Yes.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  But your information about you is not.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:04.280]  I thought something.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  So one of the things, it's not a secret.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.280]  It's in the, it's in the small print or it looked small to me, but it's in the,
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:17.280]  you know, the description of using it that, um, uh, come fall, any app that uses a third
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  party sign in service will have to offer sign in with Apple as one of the options.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.280]  And at first I think the reaction was, Ooh, that's a little heavy handed.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:31.280]  And then, cause it just seems like you're, you're issuing a dictum.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.280]  I can, you know, you're bossing people around, but you think if you give it any thought,
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.280]  it just makes sense for everybody involved.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280]  Absolutely.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280]  Right.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280]  Yeah.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.280]  Again, going back developers and ones that first asked us to do it, uh, at a customer
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.280]  level, I mean, customers, you know, when it comes to privacy, you want transparency and
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]  control, right?
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:53.280]  You want the customer to know what information are they giving to somebody and they want
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.280]  to control of whether to do that or not.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.280]  In the situation of these buttons, there's a transparency.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:02.280]  People had no idea what kind of information was flowing through that single tap.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:07.280]  And so what we wanted to do is provide that transparency and control, right?
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.280]  The normal authentication, there's no information flowing.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.280]  Yeah, maybe they're here.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.280]  In the event that the developer wants that additional information, you see what's going
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.280]  to go to them, right?
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.280]  You see the name and you can edit it.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.280]  They, you see that at your email, unless you choose to hide it.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.280]  And that we've given the randomized email address.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:36.280]  So we have that transparency, that transparency and control.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:42.280]  So in the event that an app is providing those means to log in through a social networking,
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:46.280]  then we said we should offer customers this more private choice.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.280]  If they're not doing that, right, they just have their own authentication, their own system
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]  of, of logging in.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.280]  They don't need to do this, but it's just a matter of, in this situation, we want to
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.280]  give those users that transparency and control as a way to authenticate.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.280]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:02.280]  And you know, privacy, this stuff, you guys have been talking about it more.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  It, it, I really think it's true.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.280]  I don't think it's any kind of change of heart or change of course from Apple strategically.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.280]  I think Apple has always had this in mind and really has never been interested in hoovering
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.280]  up personal data about its users.
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:20.280]  It's just become culturally something that people, even if you're not Apple customers,
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:26.280]  people are just talking about all sorts of stuff in the tech industry are suddenly sort
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.280]  of dawning on them that, that we've been living through a privacy apocalypse for the
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.280]  last.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.280]  Well, and I like to say, John, and you've heard me say it before, we've been doing privacy
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  since, privacy since before it was popular.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.280]  Right.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.280]  Right.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.280]  I mean, we were building it into our systems and building what we do when no one outside
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.280]  of Germany seemed to care.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.280]  You know, the Germans care a lot, you know, and, and we were doing it cause we knew it
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  was the right thing to do.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.280]  And you've heard Craig say it, you've heard Tim say it, you know, privacy is a fundamental
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.280]  human right.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  And whether it was popular or not, you know, we were going to do it.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.280]  And fortunately it's gotten more popular, which has been a good position for us since
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.280]  we've worked pretty hard on it over the years.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  This, this really goes, I mean, all the way back to the origins of the company.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.280]  I mean, the, the Apple was created to be the personal computer company.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.280]  And remember the competition was some kind of time shared mainframe, have all your data
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]  somewhere else.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.280]  And the idea of you can have your own computer, got your own diskettes and that's, you got
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  your stuff, it's yours, right?
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.280]  And that's been, that's, that's at the core of who we are.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.280]  And if you look at some of these other companies, that's clearly not at the core of, of who
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]  they are.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.280]  And we're also a company where our idea is we're building stuff that we would want for
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:39.280]  ourselves, that we would want for our families, you know, our children, our friends.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.280]  And I don't want to be tracked.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.280]  I don't want my family to be tracked, right?
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:49.280]  So we've, we've always been wanting to build this stuff because we just think it's the
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.280]  right thing to do.
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.280]  And there was a time where everyone's saying, privacy is dead and you guys are so naive
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  and why do you care about this?
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  And is this disadvantaging you?
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  And no, it's just right.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.280]  We can't top that.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.280]  I think let's, let's call that a show.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:19.280]  Thank yous.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  I have a bunch of people to thank.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:27.280]  Let me thank Craig and Jaws for your time.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:46.280]  Every single year I spend my Tuesday at WDC saying, what, why do I do this?
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  I'm a nervous wreck.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  And then it's over and I'm like, wow, that was fun.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.280]  What are you guys doing next month?
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  We can do this all the time.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.280]  This is great.
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.280]  There's other people at Apple and I know, you know, that there's all sorts of people
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:06.280]  at Apple who, who helped make this possible, helped get these guys here.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:10.280]  I want to thank somebody who has a big part in doing WWDC.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.280]  His name's Nitin Mishra.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:19.280]  Nitin, he's probably mad at me that I'm thanking him, but he literally brought these chairs
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:23.280]  from Infinite Loop in a pickup truck.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  I thought I recognized it.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.280]  They're very nice chairs.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.280]  I really, I just wouldn't be comfortable up here if we didn't have nice chairs.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.280]  And so that is like the least of what he's done.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.280]  So he's really done a great job.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  I don't know that this show would be possible without him.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.280]  As always, I want to thank the wonderful staff here at the California Theatre.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.280]  They are such nice people.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:54.280]  Oh my God.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.280]  I'm a big believer in Murphy's Law.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.280]  I figure everything's going to go wrong.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.280]  The lights aren't going to work.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.280]  The sound's not going to work.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]  And nothing went wrong.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.280]  So I really can't believe it.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.280]  I want to thank Tito.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.280]  John, they forgot to hit record.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:20.280]  It looks like Syracuse has captured it all.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.280]  We've just been trying to suck our souls into that thing.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:28.280]  I want to thank Tito, T-I dot T-O, the ticketing service I use
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.280]  run by my friend Paul Campbell and it's a great team.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.280]  Really a great service.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.280]  I don't know what I would do without it.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:41.280]  I probably wouldn't have a show or make somebody else sell the tickets.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.280]  I want to thank the sponsors.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.280]  MacStadium, a great, great hosting service to get your Mac hardware
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:52.280]  or use their Mac hardware in truly pro data centers.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:55.280]  OmniFocus from the Omni Group, now available on the web
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.280]  in the craziest way possible, which is beautiful.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.280]  It really looks great.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.280]  And Slack, who are hiring iOS engineers and iOS engineers
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.280]  might soon be Mac engineers.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.280]  That's right.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.280]  We should start calling them UI kit engineers, really.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.280]  I think so.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:15.280]  And some of my friends who helped me do this show,
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:23.280]  Marco Armand is up there with a live audio stream.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.280]  For the fifth year in a row, Jake Shoemaker is shooting the video,
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.280]  which will be out soon.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.280]  I don't know how soon, but hopefully tomorrow.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:35.280]  But he does a great job, makes us all look good.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.280]  My friend Caleb Sexton, who edits my show every week,
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.280]  the audio is up there making sure we sound good
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.280]  and make sure our mics are on and all of that.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:54.280]  And our very fine announcer, Paul Kefasis, good friend.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:46:03.280]  And my wife Amy, half of you probably already got help from her.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.280]  It was like five minutes before the show
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.280]  and there was something minor wrong, not major wrong,
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.280]  and Josh just turned to her and he was like, you do everything.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.280]  And she agreed.
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:16.280]  Yeah, she did.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:20.280]  But I really don't know what I would do without her.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.280]  My thanks to her.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:23.280]  She does a great job.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:26.280]  And last but not least, of course, all of you.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.280]  Thank you in the room.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:30.280]  On the internet.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.280]  Thank you very much for coming.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:39.280]  Thank you, sir.
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:53.280]  Thanks for coming out.
