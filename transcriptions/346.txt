[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  I'm so excited to have you here. You have a brand new game out called
[00:03.040 --> 00:06.480]  NotWords, and I'll just say this once because on a podcast it's often
[00:06.480 --> 00:12.560]  difficult. It's cannot words. Yes, with a K. But you have made a slew
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.440]  of games over the years. I think not entirely, and I'll just say
[00:17.440 --> 00:20.720]  NotWords is also available for Mac and PC on Steam.
[00:20.720 --> 00:25.440]  It is on iOS, of course, in the App Store, and it's also on Android Play right
[00:25.440 --> 00:28.320]  there on day one, launched last week. But let's just talk,
[00:28.320 --> 00:33.120]  let's run through some of the games that you have made over the years.
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.040]  I'll just start with, I'll tell you, I'll just be up front. My favorite
[00:37.040 --> 00:42.720]  Zach Gage game is Really Bad Chess. Oh, thank you. Which I want to talk about
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.880]  specifically later, but tell me some of the other games.
[00:44.880 --> 00:48.160]  Tell us some of the games that you've made. Oh gosh, there are a lot.
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.080]  I tend to try to make games that are a twist on
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.320]  traditional game genres and traditional game literacy so that
[00:56.320 --> 01:01.120]  they're more approachable to most human beings and not just video game
[01:01.120 --> 01:03.680]  people. So Really Bad Chess, I made a couple
[01:03.680 --> 01:06.640]  solitaires, Flip Flop Solitaire, Sage Solitaire,
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.040]  Pocket Run Pool is a billiards game, Spell Tower, Type Shift, or other word
[01:11.040 --> 01:14.480]  games. I did Ridiculous Fishing, which was an
[01:14.480 --> 01:18.800]  Apple Game of the Year and Apple Award winner, and then I have a bunch of older,
[01:18.800 --> 01:23.200]  more art-related stuff and little games that got destroyed in the 32-bit
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.200]  apocalypse. We should talk about that. I'm going to
[01:25.200 --> 01:28.800]  make a note for that, but Ridiculous Fishing is one that I
[01:28.800 --> 01:33.600]  have... as soon as you said it, it was one of those things where I got
[01:33.600 --> 01:37.680]  like a dopamine hit from my brain, where my brain was like, you should go
[01:37.680 --> 01:41.040]  play Ridiculous Fishing, because that was another one that was an
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.080]  all-time favorite. Can you describe it for people who
[01:44.080 --> 01:47.760]  don't remember it? I mean, when did that come out? That was pretty early, right?
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.440]  In the iPhone era. Yeah, I want to... boy, I should probably... I have a really bad
[01:53.440 --> 01:57.040]  memory for dates and names, but I think it was either
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.800]  2012 or 2011. It's pretty old. Yeah, it was a collaboration with Vlambeer
[02:02.800 --> 02:05.840]  and Greg Woolwind, and we were making basically a sequel
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.080]  to another Vlambeer game called Radical Fishing, and it's kind of
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.800]  an absurdist fishing game where you try to get a hook as low as
[02:14.800 --> 02:18.240]  possible, and by dodging all the fish, and then when
[02:18.240 --> 02:21.360]  you come up, you try to catch as many of the fish as possible, and then when it
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.560]  hits the surface, all the fish get flung into the air, and then you
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.840]  shoot them with uzis and machine guns and rocket launchers.
[02:29.840 --> 02:33.760]  It was... is... does it still work? Is that one of the games that's been
[02:33.760 --> 02:37.440]  axed by the apocalypse? It hasn't been axed, but it doesn't work
[02:37.440 --> 02:42.560]  on a lot of the newer phone sizes, but we're sort of hopeful that
[02:42.560 --> 02:44.880]  we'll get it working again sometime soon in the
[02:44.880 --> 02:48.480]  future, because we all sort of really miss it being playable.
[02:48.480 --> 02:52.000]  One of the things that Ridiculous Fishing...
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.800]  that struck me as... I am not a game designer at all,
[02:56.800 --> 03:03.760]  but I'm definitely a UI designer, and I think about form and structure
[03:03.760 --> 03:10.480]  and input, and it was a great game for the phone.
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.960]  Like, to me, that was sort of the... in the early days of the iPhone and then
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.960]  Android, you know, once Android became very iPhone-ish,
[03:20.960 --> 03:24.640]  there was clearly an enormous opportunity
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.680]  for games, because we had these amazingly powerful
[03:27.680 --> 03:33.920]  computers in our pockets with beautiful color screens, right? And, you know,
[03:33.920 --> 03:38.400]  by a certain standard, like, the worst Android... like, when Android first started
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.200]  playing around with OLED screens in the early 2010s, and some of them
[03:43.200 --> 03:47.600]  had some really wonky colors for, like, the... in the, like, the cyans and
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.880]  reds, the magentas. Even then, even by that standard, though, by the history of
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.240]  video games, these were great screens where you could do
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.720]  really colorful stuff if you wanted to, but the controls were so
[04:00.720 --> 04:04.960]  limited, right? What do you do? Like, it was such a breakthrough
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.960]  when Steve Jobs and Apple introduced the original iPhone, and it's like...
[04:08.960 --> 04:11.920]  and they said, look, all these other phones, like Blackberries, have these
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.520]  keyboards and all these buttons and d-pads and all this stuff,
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.600]  and it takes up all this space, and then what if you come up with an idea
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.240]  that these controls don't work well with? Well, we know the answer to that. It's
[04:24.240 --> 04:27.120]  called software. What if we just made everything software and just put it, you
[04:27.120 --> 04:32.400]  know, just make it a big screen? Great idea, but really not great for
[04:32.400 --> 04:37.920]  games, as games had been known to be... as games had been known to be up until
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.760]  2007, right? Yeah, well, I think that's actually... that's how I ended up
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.480]  being excited to work on the iPhone, was like, I came out of
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.560]  doing interactive art and interactive technology,
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.480]  and so the idea that there was this screen
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.520]  that used a mechanic that nothing had ever used,
[04:59.520 --> 05:03.680]  that like, I could be the first person to make a game in a certain style that
[05:03.680 --> 05:07.520]  played with multi-touch, was like really interesting and intoxicating, and it felt
[05:07.520 --> 05:11.120]  like just a thrilling space to be. Because, you
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.880]  know, if you're making a game for an Xbox, you have the controller that all
[05:16.880 --> 05:20.560]  the other games use, and, you know, almost every game
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.160]  you make is saddled with all of the expectations
[05:24.160 --> 05:26.560]  that players have for how they're going to interact with it.
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.280]  And so that component, that sort of narrow slice of game design,
[05:31.280 --> 05:34.480]  which is the interactive part, is just not
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.000]  present for a lot of game design on those consoles. Whereas
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.280]  with a multi-touch screen, at the beginning of the App Store, when
[05:41.280 --> 05:44.320]  there were no multi-touch games, no one had figured out how to make games work
[05:44.320 --> 05:47.840]  on this kind of screen, you got to spend a lot of time really
[05:47.840 --> 05:51.040]  thinking about, well, how does someone even interact
[05:51.040 --> 05:54.320]  with this? What is this able to do? How can we make games that
[05:54.320 --> 05:56.800]  operate on this? We don't have buttons anymore. What do we do?
[05:56.800 --> 06:01.920]  And so originally what actually got me interested in doing games was
[06:01.920 --> 06:06.800]  my wife, my girlfriend at the time, had an iPhone touch and she downloaded
[06:06.800 --> 06:10.720]  Tetris, and I don't know if you remember the original Tetris on the iPhone, but it
[06:10.720 --> 06:14.960]  was, like, horrible. I do, because I love Tetris as
[06:14.960 --> 06:20.080]  one of my all-time favorite games. I just love it, and it was,
[06:20.080 --> 06:23.280]  and honestly, to this day, it's still terrible on the phone.
[06:23.280 --> 06:26.560]  Yeah, because, well, Tetris is a game about buttons.
[06:26.560 --> 06:29.520]  It's like, one of the things that's beautiful about it is how much it
[06:29.520 --> 06:33.840]  celebrates buttons, and the sort of simplicity and elegance of
[06:33.840 --> 06:37.120]  its input with buttons. And it just didn't work on the phone, and
[06:37.120 --> 06:40.480]  I was like, oh my god, this is what games are right now? This is the games people
[06:40.480 --> 06:43.920]  are coming out with? Like, I just got out of grad school, but, like, I think I can
[06:43.920 --> 06:48.960]  make something better than this. And so I started exploring and working
[06:48.960 --> 06:52.640]  in that space, and I met Flambier, who had done radical
[06:52.640 --> 06:55.520]  fishing, and I saw it, and I played it, and I was like, oh my god, this
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.680]  could be amazing on a phone. This is exactly the game. The shooting
[06:59.680 --> 07:03.920]  and touching would be perfect. Using tilt for the movement would be perfect.
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.000]  So I kind of approached them and talked with my friend Greg, and we
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  convinced them that this would be this really
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.040]  awesome game if we could do it. I'm out of my league
[07:13.040 --> 07:16.880]  talking about old Nintendo stuff, because I was more of a Sega Genesis,
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.440]  well, definitely way, way more. But I always thought that one of the things, I
[07:21.440 --> 07:24.400]  never actually owned a Game Boy back in the day,
[07:24.400 --> 07:28.320]  but I was always very tempted. And honestly, I would have just glued the
[07:28.320 --> 07:31.040]  Tetris cartridge in. It would have been fine. I would have
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.080]  just bought the Game Boy and just put the Tetris cartridge in. But one of
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.880]  the things that always struck me, and I had plenty of friends who had
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.440]  one, so I knew to play it, but Tetris was so perfect for Game Boy,
[07:41.440 --> 07:47.120]  because Game Boy, to me, a D-pad isn't...
[07:47.120 --> 07:50.720]  it is what it is. It's not bad, it's not necessarily good, but a D-pad
[07:50.720 --> 07:58.080]  is buttons as opposed to a stick. And it's not a joystick like from my youth
[07:58.080 --> 08:02.160]  of like an Atari 2600 and, you know, like the modern Xbox
[08:02.160 --> 08:05.600]  PlayStation-style controllers where you have these thumbsticks.
[08:05.600 --> 08:08.400]  And I understand you, you need the thumbstick for some games, because you
[08:08.400 --> 08:11.840]  need to not just say up, but up a little,
[08:11.840 --> 08:15.040]  you know, like I'm creeping forward or I'm pushing forward.
[08:15.040 --> 08:22.800]  Whereas Tetris, it's left, right, rotate, drop. Buttons are perfect for that.
[08:22.800 --> 08:27.040]  And a black and white screen was fine. It was, if anything, in my opinion, maybe
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.240]  better. It's more pure. It was just a perfect
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.040]  combination of concept to device. I used to play, when I was in
[08:35.040 --> 08:37.520]  high school, one of my best friends and I would go to
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.840]  the local coin-operated arcade. Among the games we'd play was we'd spend
[08:41.840 --> 08:44.320]  quarters on Tetris, and people would be like, why are you
[08:44.320 --> 08:46.960]  wasting money on Tetris when you can play Tetris at home?
[08:46.960 --> 08:52.000]  And we're like, yeah, but this is a really good Tetris.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.240]  Yeah, I mean, I have played Tetris with a joystick, and it is thrilling also with
[08:56.240 --> 08:58.720]  a joystick. But I do totally agree with you about the
[08:58.720 --> 09:02.320]  D-pad. It is perfect. And actually, there's a device that came out recently
[09:02.320 --> 09:05.680]  called the Analog Pocket, which is like a performance
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.960]  Game Boy kind of. And my wife and I got them, and we've been playing a lot of
[09:08.960 --> 09:12.880]  Tetris on it, and it's really rekindled a lot of my memories of Tetris
[09:12.880 --> 09:16.480]  on the Game Boy. And I think, you know, there's more to it than just
[09:16.480 --> 09:19.440]  the buttons in the Game Boy and the black and white. It's also
[09:19.440 --> 09:23.600]  that the Game Boy was such a forerunner of this idea of a game that you had in
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.840]  your pocket that you could take out and play for just a small amount of time.
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.520]  And this idea that you could hook it up to a friend's Game Boy, and then you
[09:31.520 --> 09:34.080]  could play Tetris against each other. It was like
[09:34.080 --> 09:36.960]  the whole context of the Game Boy was just
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.040]  perfect for Tetris in this way that not a lot of other things were. I mean, you
[09:41.040 --> 09:44.640]  talk about playing it at the arcade or playing it at home. The Game Boy was
[09:44.640 --> 09:48.320]  both, right? You could play it in bed. You could play it at school. You could
[09:48.320 --> 09:51.200]  play it with your friends. It kind of had all of those things. You could
[09:51.200 --> 09:55.520]  play it on the bus or the subway. Yeah. Or the car. While you were
[09:55.520 --> 09:58.000]  waiting in line to play Tetris at the arcade.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.200]  It's probably the single greatest thing that ever happened
[10:01.200 --> 10:05.840]  to the back seat of a family car. Absolutely.
[10:05.840 --> 10:09.040]  Because you couldn't read in the back seat of a car because, you know, the
[10:09.040 --> 10:12.640]  movement of the car, it's too much. But you could definitely play a Game Boy.
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.240]  But anyway, back to Ridiculous Fishing. The one thing that struck me
[10:16.240 --> 10:19.360]  so great, in addition to the fact that the controls
[10:19.360 --> 10:23.760]  were perfect, it wasn't like, oh man, I really wish I had physical buttons. It
[10:23.760 --> 10:27.200]  was like, no, you don't need physical buttons for this game. It's not like,
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.920]  what was that game? It was like in the initial, the very initial
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.360]  release of the App Store, it was like a Sega game, like
[10:35.360 --> 10:40.080]  infinite runner down like a roller coaster track.
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.200]  I don't know. But it was a fake D-pad game.
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.560]  There were so many of those. Yeah.
[10:46.560 --> 10:49.920]  And so many of the initial games, too, made you rotate
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.920]  the phone, which isn't necessarily bad. There's some great phone games where
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.640]  you play them horizontally as opposed to vertically.
[10:56.640 --> 11:02.240]  But Ridiculous Fishing was meant to be vertical because you drop the hook
[11:02.240 --> 11:09.040]  down. So having a screen that was vertically oriented is optimal
[11:09.040 --> 11:12.640]  for the concept because you want to go deep and down
[11:12.640 --> 11:17.200]  and therefore holding the phone in the natural way, which is vertical,
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.480]  it fit in a way where you'd never make that game
[11:20.480 --> 11:27.120]  for a widescreen TV. Right. Or you'd have to change a lot.
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.800]  Right. I should never have used the word
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.000]  never there because you're a creative game designer and it's
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.560]  instantly going to start your brain turning and you're thinking,
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.400]  well, wait a second. Yeah, you could make it like fly fishing where you go
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.160]  sideways or something like that. Yeah, or you just rotate your whole TV,
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.640]  you know, just get people to rotate. You should sell TV stands to come
[11:48.640 --> 11:51.200]  with the game. But that was a great game. That really was.
[11:51.200 --> 11:57.040]  And it's just so much fun. Now let's talk about how you got into
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.080]  game design. I guess we'll sort of go in
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.200]  chronological order, but I might as well take a break and thank our first friend
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.800]  of the show and it's our good friends at Collide. They spell it
[12:08.800 --> 12:13.360]  K-O-L-I-D-E, Collide. And me, like an idiot, the first couple
[12:13.360 --> 12:17.200]  times they sponsored the podcast, I said Collide because I thought, well, if they
[12:17.200 --> 12:19.760]  spell it weird, maybe it's pronounced weird. But then
[12:19.760 --> 12:23.280]  after like two episodes, I asked them and they very politely said, no, we just
[12:23.280 --> 12:26.160]  say Collide. I was like, oh, sorry. And they were like,
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.320]  no, we laughed. But Collide is a great company. They have
[12:30.320 --> 12:34.000]  a new take on endpoint management that asks, how can
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.560]  we get end users more involved? Look, most places
[12:38.560 --> 12:42.640]  that use MDM try to lock down their employees' devices without
[12:42.640 --> 12:46.240]  considering the employees' needs or even attempting to educate them
[12:46.240 --> 12:50.960]  about the security of their laptop. Collide is built by
[12:50.960 --> 12:55.760]  like-minded security practitioners who saw past this whole problem and
[12:55.760 --> 12:59.600]  realized that MDM was disrupting their end users, often
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.720]  frustrating them so badly that they'd just throw up their hands
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.320]  and switch to using their personal laptops without telling anyone,
[13:06.320 --> 13:11.600]  which defeats the whole purpose of using MDM to protect your company's
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.680]  stuff and to try to keep your employees' information and the company information
[13:15.680 --> 13:18.960]  that employees are using safe. So instead of locking down a device,
[13:18.960 --> 13:22.160]  Collide takes a user-focused approach that communicates security
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.600]  recommendations to your employees directly on Slack. You're already using
[13:27.600 --> 13:29.680]  Slack. You sign up for Collide. You get your
[13:29.680 --> 13:32.400]  devices on Collide, your employees' devices on Collide.
[13:32.400 --> 13:35.520]  And when there's like advice or recommendations or notifications that
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.600]  come in, they just come in over Slack, something they already are
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.080]  using. So you're not asking them to install
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.800]  something else that's going to give them notifications
[13:44.800 --> 13:48.880]  from work. It's already a system where they're communicating and getting
[13:48.880 --> 13:53.200]  notifications for work-related stuff. And it can
[13:53.200 --> 13:58.400]  range from simple problems like, hey, the screen lock is not set up correctly,
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.680]  or hard to solve and nuance issues like
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.600]  asking people to secure two-factor backup codes
[14:05.600 --> 14:08.960]  that are sitting in their downloads folder or something like that,
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.360]  and ask them to secure those properly. Because it's talking directly to
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.640]  employees, Collide is educating them about the company's policies and how
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.240]  to best keep their devices secure using real, tangible
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.640]  examples, not theoretical scenarios. The bottom line is they really do want to
[14:26.640 --> 14:29.680]  keep stuff secure, but they want to do it in a way
[14:29.680 --> 14:36.160]  that is friction-free for your employees and makes them happy and educates them,
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.480]  which is all just like a virtuous circle that just keeps things going, keeps
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.440]  people happy, and keeps devices and information more secure.
[14:43.440 --> 14:47.920]  So that's Collide. Cross-platform endpoint management for Linux, Mac,
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.000]  and Windows devices that puts end users first for teams that slack.

[15:14.800 --> 15:18.480]  All right, how and when did you get started doing game design?
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.960]  Oh my gosh, well to some extent, you know, when I was a kid I guess I really
[15:22.960 --> 15:26.720]  wanted to be a game designer. Growing up on Mac,
[15:26.720 --> 15:30.000]  it was really interesting because almost everything I played was
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.400]  shareware that was by developers, and so unlike a lot of my friends who are
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.400]  playing Nintendo games or Xbox games or, well I guess not Xbox at the
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.760]  time, PlayStation, where these games are made by giant companies,
[15:41.760 --> 15:45.760]  I was playing games that were made by developers who you could email
[15:45.760 --> 15:50.160]  and interact with and write, and so I got interested in this idea of
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.960]  making games, and I used the first thing I really got into was Hyper Studio,
[15:54.960 --> 15:59.600]  which was like a color and multimedia version of HyperCard,
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.960]  and then I got into this thing called Coco, which was like a
[16:02.960 --> 16:07.040]  bespoke educational tool that Apple put out before
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.200]  Jobs came back and axed all of the educational
[16:11.200 --> 16:14.960]  stuff and weird little side hobbies that had been going on at Apple
[16:14.960 --> 16:18.880]  to focus on one thing. And to be clear, I don't want to interrupt you, but to be
[16:18.880 --> 16:21.520]  clear, this was a Coco that is completely
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.480]  unrelated. Among the other things Steve Jobs did
[16:24.480 --> 16:28.320]  is completely reuse the name Coco for something entirely different.
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.680]  Okay, apparently such a good name. Yes. It had to come back.
[16:31.680 --> 16:34.960]  Yeah, so I was making games in that, and then I
[16:34.960 --> 16:38.880]  went to high school and learned how to program and thought I was going to
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.800]  be someone making games, and then I went to college and I went to
[16:42.800 --> 16:45.840]  Skidmore College, which is a wonderful school, and
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.280]  they have a really incredible art program and a really
[16:49.280 --> 16:52.720]  lacking computer science program, or at least they did when I was there, so
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.320]  I dropped computer science entirely and basically went
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.280]  hard into being a fine artist and learning how to paint and draw and
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.520]  sculpt really poorly and do all the things that fine artists do. I got really
[17:05.520 --> 17:09.200]  into photography and design, and then when it was coming up to the end
[17:09.200 --> 17:12.640]  of the year or to the end of my time at college and I had to do an
[17:12.640 --> 17:16.240]  end-of-year show, I thought back on a lot of the things that had been inspiring to
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.960]  me in high school artistically, like preystation.com and a lot of early
[17:20.960 --> 17:23.920]  Jared Tarbell, a lot of early flash experiments, and
[17:23.920 --> 17:26.560]  around this time processing.org was going on,
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.680]  and I realized like, oh, I have this programming background, I can do these
[17:31.680 --> 17:36.240]  kinds of interactive things that a lot of my classmates don't know how to do,
[17:36.240 --> 17:41.520]  and what if I try to create art using these skills? So I started doing
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.520]  that and I got out of school and I came to New York and I met
[17:45.520 --> 17:48.720]  up with this artist, Zach Lieberman, who ran
[17:48.720 --> 17:51.920]  something called Open Frameworks, which is sort of a C++
[17:51.920 --> 17:55.200]  version of Processing. It's like a creative coding
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.280]  library for C++, and through him I did a lot of
[17:59.280 --> 18:04.320]  work in Open Frameworks and creating interactive artwork, and I went to
[18:04.320 --> 18:08.400]  Parsons and met some games people there, and that's sort of where I
[18:08.400 --> 18:12.480]  started working with the iPhone and making some games, and
[18:12.480 --> 18:15.840]  I fell in love with the phone and I fell in love with the games community,
[18:15.840 --> 18:20.720]  because at that time it was really small and it was just 100%
[18:20.720 --> 18:25.920]  incredible geniuses. You'd go to a conference and every single person I met
[18:25.920 --> 18:29.760]  in 2007 is basically a famous indie developer now,
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.520]  and it was just an incredible thrilling experience to be surrounded by
[18:33.520 --> 18:37.040]  so many incredibly talented people, and I just got sucked into games that I've
[18:37.040 --> 18:40.000]  been making games ever since. There's a certain type of
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.960]  personality that is drawn to a new frontier
[18:42.960 --> 18:47.280]  when it's this great unknown. Instead of being terrifying
[18:47.280 --> 18:51.120]  or feeling lost or just standing at the edge and looking at it,
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.720]  they're like, oh I need to go out there and just start exploring.
[18:54.720 --> 18:57.840]  This is fantastic because there's no preconceptions
[18:57.840 --> 19:01.520]  as to what it could be. And there was no money,
[19:01.520 --> 19:08.160]  so it was just people who were like, I have a thing that I need to get out
[19:08.160 --> 19:12.000]  and explain to people and show people, and I'm gonna do it,
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.920]  and hopefully you'll really enjoy it, and so it was just
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.280]  super highly motivated, incredibly talented artists.
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.320]  From my perspective, that's sort of like the early years of blogging,
[19:22.320 --> 19:27.680]  where the idea that you as a writer or somebody who just
[19:27.680 --> 19:31.520]  wants to post things regularly to your own website under your own
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.040]  name, you just do it and nobody really even
[19:35.040 --> 19:37.600]  knew what it should look like. What order
[19:37.600 --> 19:40.880]  should things show up in? Should they just all show up on the home page? What
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.840]  should they do? And again, no money in it at all.
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.200]  Nobody even had any ideas for how to make money, which was kind of,
[19:47.200 --> 19:52.800]  you know, it never lasts. We'll get there talking about games. It
[19:52.800 --> 19:57.200]  never lasts, but it is fun at the beginning. It's been
[19:57.200 --> 20:00.320]  one of the most interesting things for me, having gone through
[20:00.320 --> 20:03.840]  the career that I've had, is being able to
[20:03.840 --> 20:07.520]  see a bubble and ride it and see the end of it and see what comes out of it.
[20:07.520 --> 20:13.120]  Having gotten to spend 10 years experiencing that, I feel very lucky to
[20:13.120 --> 20:16.400]  have that kind of perspective now. What was the
[20:16.400 --> 20:20.880]  first iPhone game that you had that hit the App Store?
[20:20.880 --> 20:23.920]  So the first app I ever made was something called
[20:23.920 --> 20:29.600]  Synth Pond, which given my light lisp, I really regret naming a game that.
[20:29.600 --> 20:34.560]  It's like impossible to say. But that was a sound
[20:34.560 --> 20:40.880]  toy, I guess. I was really inspired by people like Toshio EY and the
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.480]  other sort of experimental audio toys, and so
[20:44.480 --> 20:48.560]  Synth Pond was a spatial sequencer. I feel like I really love
[20:48.560 --> 20:52.080]  music, but I'm not able to understand music.
[20:52.080 --> 20:55.840]  I can't create music the way that everybody else can. It just doesn't
[20:55.840 --> 20:59.520]  work for the way that my brain works. And so this was more of a
[20:59.520 --> 21:03.360]  thinking about, well, what if it was a tool
[21:03.360 --> 21:07.040]  for spatial people, for people who think in a spatial sense?
[21:07.040 --> 21:11.680]  So it was all about laying down nodes that would like reverberate a sound, and
[21:11.680 --> 21:14.960]  then when that sound hit other nodes, they would respond with sounds.
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.880]  It was basically this tool that sort of instead of composing in a sequence, it
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.720]  let you compose in a space. And it was something that I had made on
[21:22.720 --> 21:26.320]  the computer and put out on my website as just something you could download on
[21:26.320 --> 21:29.440]  the Mac. And I was probably getting like 200 hits
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.760]  a day on my website at that point, but nobody ever wrote me or talked about
[21:33.760 --> 21:37.200]  this thing. And then the iPhone came out, and I thought, oh,
[21:37.200 --> 21:40.800]  this is like a really cool device for this. Maybe I could
[21:40.800 --> 21:44.800]  make this experience on this. And I had all these ideas about how to use the
[21:44.800 --> 21:47.520]  multi-touch to, you know, you grab one thing and hit
[21:47.520 --> 21:50.720]  something else, and that lets you change the note. So I was really excited, and I
[21:50.720 --> 21:54.000]  built it. And I put it out, and it got covered on
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.720]  MacRumors, and it made like $20,000,
[21:58.720 --> 22:02.960]  and people were writing me emails and thanking me for coming up with this cool
[22:02.960 --> 22:07.200]  idea. And one of the musicians of Dream
[22:07.200 --> 22:11.760]  Theater, who's like a pretty big metal band, wrote me, and I
[22:11.760 --> 22:15.120]  got to go to the studio and hang out with him, and we had lunch and talked
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.120]  about all this stuff. And I was just like, what is this place?
[22:19.120 --> 22:22.880]  Like, what is this device in this app store
[22:22.880 --> 22:26.560]  that I can just put this thing out there and that nobody
[22:26.560 --> 22:30.640]  cared about on the web, but here it's making me money, and it's finding
[22:30.640 --> 22:34.240]  an audience, and I'm getting contacted, and people are thanking me for being
[22:34.240 --> 22:38.000]  able to buy this thing. It was just such a mind-blowing moment.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  Not to go off on a tangent, but there's a new book out, Beyond Steve, I
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.720]  think, by Tripp Meckle. It just came out this week. The New York Times had an
[22:44.720 --> 22:48.560]  excerpt over the weekend, and it's sort, it seems like, I haven't read the book
[22:48.560 --> 22:51.920]  yet, but I have it, but it's sort of, things aren't the same without Steve
[22:51.920 --> 22:55.600]  Jobs, and if things had gone better after Steve
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.920]  Jobs died, Apple would have come up with another
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.640]  thing like the iPhone, since. And there have been a series of
[23:02.640 --> 23:06.160]  books like that since he died, and I think a lot of them
[23:06.160 --> 23:10.240]  have fared very poorly. I'm curious about how this one goes, because it's written a
[23:10.240 --> 23:14.960]  whole decade afterwards, and so therefore it's not quite so much a prediction, but
[23:14.960 --> 23:20.160]  more of reporting about what did happen. But my fundamental theory about why
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.760]  phones are such a hit is, and I don't think
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.160]  Gapple knew this before the iPhone came out. I think they knew they had something
[23:28.160 --> 23:31.360]  great, and when Steve Jobs just showed it to people
[23:31.360 --> 23:35.360]  at that Macworld keynote, those were like the longest six months
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.560]  of our lives waiting to actually get it. Because there was something
[23:40.560 --> 23:44.560]  obvious like, oh my god, I need to have that. But I think ultimately
[23:44.560 --> 23:51.760]  what the phones are is the, it's the end point of personal computers, and
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.920]  it's like personal computers came out in the late 70s, and Apple was there with
[23:55.920 --> 23:59.760]  the Apple II, and then the Mac came out in the 80s,
[23:59.760 --> 24:02.880]  and things evolved, and Windows obviously
[24:02.880 --> 24:07.520]  became this huge, huge hit for literally billions of people around the world on
[24:07.520 --> 24:12.400]  PCs. But it's like with the phones, and
[24:12.400 --> 24:16.800]  everything about them, the size, the fact that they're always with you,
[24:16.800 --> 24:23.120]  the way that you can't screw them up as a typical user, there's nothing you
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.560]  can do to screw up an iPhone. You know, you cannot,
[24:26.560 --> 24:30.720]  you can't make a mistake, and oh, you should not have installed that game,
[24:30.720 --> 24:33.920]  because that game puts like a background agent in, and that thing will,
[24:33.920 --> 24:37.360]  it just runs all the time, and it's really hard to uninstall. You can't do
[24:37.360 --> 24:42.480]  anything like that. It's like, for so long before the internet,
[24:42.480 --> 24:45.440]  all of us who were into computers were like, why aren't more people into
[24:45.440 --> 24:48.880]  computers? Like, the Macintosh slogan was the computer for the rest of us, and it
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.640]  did expand computing to more people who just were turned off by the command
[24:54.640 --> 24:56.960]  line computers that came before, and like, I
[24:56.960 --> 24:59.520]  don't, you know, this is gibberish. This is not for me.
[24:59.520 --> 25:03.120]  It definitely expanded it, especially for artists, I think,
[25:03.120 --> 25:06.160]  the way that the whole design industry from
[25:06.160 --> 25:12.720]  education, from colleges on up, revolutionized itself in short order. In
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.600]  hindsight, it's kind of bananas. Companies and industries
[25:15.600 --> 25:20.160]  don't just change from, this is the way we've always done things, to
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.280]  oh, we're going to throw it all out, and we're going to do everything
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.960]  in QuarkXPress or PageMaker for layout, and we're going to use Illustrator for
[25:28.960 --> 25:32.800]  all of our vector, or Freehand, which I was actually more of a fan of,
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.720]  for all of our vector art, and Photoshop, and we're going to do
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.360]  everything on the computer. And until like 1986, nothing was done on
[25:41.360 --> 25:44.960]  a computer, and by 1990, everything was done on a computer. Like,
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.480]  it's kind of bananas, and it did expand it, but
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.080]  it's like the rest of us were like, why don't people want to use computers? And
[25:52.080 --> 25:54.800]  then the internet came, and it's like, oh, communication, that's what
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.880]  real people want to do on computers. And then the phones came, and it's like, oh,
[25:58.880 --> 26:03.360]  here's a computer you can't mess up. It's great for communication, and it's
[26:03.360 --> 26:07.360]  with you all the time. And boom, that's it. And that's why
[26:07.360 --> 26:10.640]  there hasn't been a thing since. There never will be a thing after
[26:10.640 --> 26:14.560]  that. There is no way to make it more portable,
[26:14.560 --> 26:19.040]  more accessible, more with you. There is nothing after that.
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.720]  I think what you just said with the portable and with you
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.040]  is also like a really critical thing for the phone.
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.240]  And one of the things that's most exciting for me about making games on
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.840]  the phone is I love making games for the context that the
[26:33.840 --> 26:36.800]  phone exists in, which is, it's in your pocket, you're
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.560]  in line, you pull it out, you do something for 30 seconds, you put it back, or it's
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.160]  in your pocket, you're watching TV, you pull it out, and you do this thing on
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.400]  the side while you're watching TV. That's this completely different context
[26:48.400 --> 26:52.400]  than most games exist in, and it's a completely different computing context
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.720]  than computers existed in beforehand. And I think this is something that right
[26:56.720 --> 27:00.720]  now, if you look at VR and the struggles that VR has had
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.000]  gaining any kind of consumer traction, I think
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.160]  it, to me, it really mirrors a lot of that earlier computer stuff, which is
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.800]  people don't want to take a break from their lives and use a computer.
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.400]  Some people do, people who love computers, but most people
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.520]  just want to live their lives, and if they can have a computer that's with
[27:19.520 --> 27:22.880]  them and does stuff, that's awesome. And the iPhone was the
[27:22.880 --> 27:27.440]  first time that really most of the world got to have a
[27:27.440 --> 27:31.040]  computer that was just with them where they could have their normal life
[27:31.040 --> 27:36.880]  and integrate a computer into that. Yeah, I agree completely, and it's
[27:36.880 --> 27:40.800]  obvious in hindsight, and it's so obvious in hindsight that I think it gets taken
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.040]  for granted, but it wasn't obvious at the time.
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.400]  And I think even Apple wasn't sure, you know, like
[27:48.400 --> 27:51.520]  it's so funny, I know everybody out there has probably watched
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.040]  the iPhone part of that Macworld keynote in 2007,
[27:55.040 --> 27:59.440]  but it is so funny watching it in hindsight how much time Steve Jobs talks
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.800]  about the phone app, right? It is so funny because, and it's
[28:04.800 --> 28:08.400]  it's like all this time spent like here, you know, and the visual voicemail
[28:08.400 --> 28:10.880]  was great, it was amazing, like voicemail used to
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.040]  really suck. You had to like dial like star 70,
[28:15.040 --> 28:18.320]  and from your phone you dialed star 70, and
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.160]  the system recognized like, oh I know your SIM card, here's your phone number.
[28:22.160 --> 28:26.000]  It was like dealing with the world's worst call center. So yes,
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.120]  it was worth it at the time. I'm not saying they made a mistake,
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.800]  but in hindsight they spent like half the time talking about the phone app,
[28:32.800 --> 28:35.760]  which most people I know are like, oh my god, I hate the phone.
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.040]  I don't, you know, getting a phone call is the worst part of your day.
[28:39.040 --> 28:43.200]  I do think Jobs did have this obsession with
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.840]  trying to make computers be more a part of lives and less computery.
[28:47.840 --> 28:52.480]  I think he really was keenly aware of what that problem was, even if he didn't
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.680]  know the answer to it. And they did try a lot of things that
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.440]  were on that road. I actually did want to say, because you were talking about the
[28:59.440 --> 29:01.760]  book, I haven't read the book, and I don't want
[29:01.760 --> 29:05.600]  to like say anything that gets me in trouble or gets anyone mad at me. But I
[29:05.600 --> 29:10.960]  do think like, one thing to think about, just for me
[29:10.960 --> 29:15.840]  being somebody who's an artist, who's like, I've made things that were really
[29:15.840 --> 29:19.520]  successful and then had to keep making things after that.
[29:19.520 --> 29:24.480]  And that experience of trying to live up to something,
[29:24.480 --> 29:28.240]  you know, being on the inside of of the thing where people would look at it and
[29:28.240 --> 29:30.800]  go, oh what, why didn't they make another thing
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.560]  like that great thing? You don't make great things by setting
[29:34.560 --> 29:37.520]  out to have brilliant ideas and make great
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.760]  things. You make great things by having ideas that you really want to
[29:41.760 --> 29:46.480]  chase down and working hard for a long time and making things that
[29:46.480 --> 29:51.200]  are really good for a long time. And then sometimes you hit upon
[29:51.200 --> 29:55.680]  something that's great. And so with this entire world of
[29:55.680 --> 29:59.360]  Apple prognostication, I'd be worried if Apple wasn't
[29:59.360 --> 30:02.720]  continuing to make great things. But they're not.
[30:02.720 --> 30:06.400]  They're doing great stuff. Everything they come up with is really
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.400]  cool and innovative and like they consistently do things that are
[30:10.400 --> 30:13.600]  like surprisingly great, like the the M1 chip.
[30:13.600 --> 30:19.760]  So to me, the thing that I look for with people I respect or companies that
[30:19.760 --> 30:23.600]  I'm interested in hearing from is, are they continuing to do really good
[30:23.600 --> 30:26.240]  work? Does most of the stuff that they put out
[30:26.240 --> 30:30.480]  inspire me in some way? I think that entire concept of like,
[30:30.480 --> 30:35.040]  well, is this person gonna have this idea that makes this thing happen? I think
[30:35.040 --> 30:39.040]  it's it's sort of flawed. Yeah, you don't, yeah,
[30:39.040 --> 30:43.200]  it's so well put. Like from the creator's perspective, there's like an
[30:43.200 --> 30:46.640]  inflection point of releasing the the thing to the world,
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.640]  and you just don't know what happens when it goes through that
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.160]  pinpoint. There's the universe on the side where
[30:54.160 --> 30:58.560]  it starts as just an idea and gets slowly more real,
[30:58.560 --> 31:01.520]  and then you're like, okay, I'm ready to release. I'm going to squeeze it through
[31:01.520 --> 31:05.600]  this pinhole into the outside world. And then from that point, and you might
[31:05.600 --> 31:08.160]  think this will be a great hit, or you might think,
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.440]  ah, I love this. I had to make this. I doubt this is going to be a hit. And
[31:13.440 --> 31:16.320]  sometimes it's like the things you think will be a big hit
[31:16.320 --> 31:19.440]  aren't, and sometimes the things that you thought,
[31:19.440 --> 31:22.800]  this is probably going to be niche. Like you were saying about Synth Pond,
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.560]  right? Like it became way more of a thing
[31:26.560 --> 31:30.480]  once it was out on the iPhone than you seem to have
[31:30.480 --> 31:34.320]  thought possible. And nothing embodies that more than the fact that the thing
[31:34.320 --> 31:36.240]  that was the biggest hit about the iPhone
[31:36.240 --> 31:41.680]  is the App Store, which wasn't part of it.
[31:43.920 --> 31:48.560]  It's so true. It really is. It's so funny thinking about how excited I was
[31:48.560 --> 31:53.200]  and the people I knew in my world who all bought the original iPhone
[31:53.200 --> 31:57.840]  and lined up on day one and used it for an entire year without any
[31:57.840 --> 32:01.760]  third-party apps. I actually jail broke mine by the fall and had a couple of
[32:01.760 --> 32:05.440]  apps. Lights Out was the first game. Yes. Right?
[32:05.440 --> 32:09.280]  Which was, I can't believe I forget, Lucas Newman I think did the programming.
[32:09.280 --> 32:13.920]  But one of the things I loved about Lights Out as a jailbreak game,
[32:13.920 --> 32:17.840]  like three months after the phone came out, right, and there was like literally
[32:17.840 --> 32:21.120]  no support in Xcode. Like it's not just the, oh there's no
[32:21.120 --> 32:24.240]  App Store. There was no third-party developer chain. Like
[32:24.240 --> 32:27.120]  everything had to be backwards engineered by the community.
[32:27.120 --> 32:30.720]  The thing I loved about Lights Out was the way that the Mac
[32:30.720 --> 32:35.280]  indie community evolved into the original iOS indie community
[32:35.280 --> 32:38.480]  is that even though there was no official tool chain, none,
[32:38.480 --> 32:43.040]  no App Store, so no way that it could possibly gain widespread adoption,
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.440]  it might break at any time if a software update had closed the jailbreak loopholes
[32:47.440 --> 32:52.720]  that we were using to install it. But it was exquisitely well done. It had
[32:52.720 --> 32:59.760]  unbelievable pixel-perfect artwork and sounds and animations. It was so
[32:59.760 --> 33:03.200]  well done. It was not just like a proof-of-concept
[33:03.200 --> 33:06.640]  prototype. It was like, oh here's an amazingly fun
[33:06.640 --> 33:10.800]  game based on like an old electronic game design thing.
[33:10.800 --> 33:14.960]  Yeah, that is such a Mac shareware community. Like if you're going to do it,
[33:14.960 --> 33:18.720]  do it right, and all the way to the tiniest details of
[33:18.720 --> 33:23.680]  each pixel, each sound, the animation curves, everything.
[33:23.680 --> 33:27.120]  It was so much fun. But it spoke to the desire,
[33:27.120 --> 33:31.440]  the sort of people who... it was almost like if I pointed that out
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.160]  to Lucas Newman or Craig Hockenberry at Icon Factory did Twitterific as a
[33:36.160 --> 33:39.920]  jailbreak app in that first year. And it was the same thing. It wasn't just
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.640]  like, oh here's an app that does Twitter. It was also like
[33:44.640 --> 33:47.680]  everything the Icon Factory does, exquisitely well designed.
[33:47.680 --> 33:50.720]  And it's like, if I really made a point of that,
[33:50.720 --> 33:54.160]  Craig and his colleagues at Icon Factory would have been like, well of
[33:54.160 --> 33:56.960]  course, you know, like it's like, why are you saying that? Of
[33:56.960 --> 33:59.440]  course we made it look as good as possible.
[33:59.440 --> 34:02.800]  Yeah, and that's such a trait of Mac shareware, and especially the Icon
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.240]  Factory, like my main memory of them is growing
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.880]  up and installing their tool that let me change the the icons of
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.560]  the default software stuff into with different themes and they had
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.400]  all these incredible exquisite icon themes and it's like, yeah
[34:18.400 --> 34:22.320]  that's gonna break as soon as Apple updates their OS, but it's
[34:22.320 --> 34:27.200]  amazing. Candy bar, right? Candy bar, yes!
[34:27.200 --> 34:30.880]  It was so awesome, and it was so pointless
[34:30.880 --> 34:35.600]  from a utilitarian perspective, but it was so
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.240]  satisfying in a different part of your brain.
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.000]  Yeah, oh my god, I haven't thought about candy bar in so long.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.680]  Yeah, I think they did that in in collaboration with Panic.
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.680]  I don't know if Panic is... Yes! Oh my god. Yeah, remember Panic? I'm not sure if
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.320]  they're still around, we'll have to say. Well, yeah.
[34:56.320 --> 34:59.520]  Yeah, what are they doing now? Tell me, you know, you were in their computers, you had
[34:59.520 --> 35:02.160]  a Mac, and you taught yourself some programming
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.080]  early, but you also definitely, you have a background as an artist,
[35:06.080 --> 35:11.120]  like going to Parsons isn't really... obviously there's an
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.560]  interactive... at the time you went there, you know, computers were obviously a
[35:14.560 --> 35:19.280]  huge part of the curriculum, but it still is a traditional artistic
[35:19.280 --> 35:22.080]  background. Almost formal? Would you
[35:22.080 --> 35:24.800]  describe yourself as a formal artist in a sense?
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, formal, formally trained artist. Yeah, there's actually... well,
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.800]  there's... so I think that the biggest thing that
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.000]  came out of... well, so first of all, I am still a
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.680]  conceptual artist, I still make work and show in galleries and
[35:39.680 --> 35:43.360]  things like that, which is really a delight to be able to have that kind of
[35:43.360 --> 35:47.680]  career and not have it be my money career, because it's like
[35:47.680 --> 35:51.520]  would be a nightmare to do it that way. But it is really interesting to be able
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.840]  to have that career and be able to take lessons back and forth from game design,
[35:55.840 --> 36:00.800]  and especially it's really great to be in game design with the perspective of
[36:00.800 --> 36:03.040]  coming from the arts where there is no money and
[36:03.040 --> 36:06.480]  everything is really different, and I think probably the biggest
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.960]  thing for me that has been valuable coming from
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.000]  the art space is this practice of making interactive art
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.960]  for the gallery. When you make something interactive and
[36:18.960 --> 36:22.960]  you put it in a gallery, it's not good enough to just make a really
[36:22.960 --> 36:26.560]  interesting piece of art. It's... you also have to trick people into
[36:26.560 --> 36:30.480]  interacting with it. And people who go into a gallery, they
[36:30.480 --> 36:35.760]  don't want to interact with art at all, they want to stand back and be quiet and
[36:35.760 --> 36:39.520]  and see it. And interacting with interactive art is even worse than
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.760]  like having to interact with anything normal, because not only are you
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.280]  trying to learn this thing and interact with this thing, but because it's in a
[36:47.280 --> 36:49.760]  gallery where everybody else is super quiet,
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.240]  like the spotlight goes on to you when you interact with it, and suddenly you're
[36:54.240 --> 36:57.600]  the performer in the space. So, you know, not only
[36:57.600 --> 37:00.800]  when you put this art up are you trying to convince people to interact with it,
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.320]  but you're also trying to make them comfortable being a
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.920]  performer. In a public space. In a public space. The
[37:07.920 --> 37:14.320]  worst, scariest place to be a performer. And there are so many interactive
[37:14.320 --> 37:17.360]  lessons that I learned from that about how to
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.640]  like prime somebody to feel comfortable interacting,
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.000]  how to get them up to speed fast enough that they
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.240]  feel comfortable exploring and and get comfortable in the space and just start
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.160]  to do the kind of creative, interesting
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.840]  interaction that makes your work shine. And
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.720]  I think in games and in design, a lot of the conversation that I hear is really
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.280]  built around how to meet a user's expectations, how to
[37:45.280 --> 37:49.120]  build a thing that will be comfortable for a user to interact with.
[37:49.120 --> 37:53.520]  You know, if you're building a tax website, you don't want the user to be
[37:53.520 --> 37:56.560]  becoming an expert at using a tax website, you just want them to
[37:56.560 --> 37:59.760]  be able to do all the stuff so that they can do their taxes.
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.920]  The other thing that the website's there for. So the design is always in service
[38:03.920 --> 38:07.360]  to this other thing. But in games and in art,
[38:07.360 --> 38:10.640]  in interactive art, the interaction is the art.
[38:10.640 --> 38:16.480]  That's the experience. And so it's really important, you know,
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.920]  when you look at something like Candy Crush or a lot of freemium games, a lot
[38:19.920 --> 38:22.880]  of times the design is there to get people to
[38:22.880 --> 38:26.560]  be doing the real thing, which is spending the money or thinking about
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.000]  the puzzle or getting frustrated. But in the best games,
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.440]  what you really want people to do is become performers.
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.560]  And because performers are the most skilled and the most exciting players,
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.160]  they're the people who will do things with your game that you never
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.560]  thought were possible, and they're also the people who are the
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.040]  most likely to be able to grow with your game and to take something away
[38:49.040 --> 38:52.240]  and say, wow, I really value playing that. That helped me as a
[38:52.240 --> 38:59.200]  person in some way. And so there's this different kind of way to approach design
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.240]  where you think about how to turn people into the most
[39:02.240 --> 39:06.640]  talented performers that they can be. And I think I really, that's a really
[39:06.640 --> 39:10.880]  big deal for me with game design, and it came directly out of that art practice.
[39:10.880 --> 39:17.040]  Yeah, I mean, Annette has spoken like a natural born artist. And again, it's
[39:17.040 --> 39:20.720]  not like you don't make money. And we'll talk about that, but it comes
[39:20.720 --> 39:25.920]  to one of my favorite points that it's little bits of wisdom if I could
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.440]  impart to everybody is that one of the most important is that it's not
[39:29.440 --> 39:35.040]  enough to just have a handful of top priorities. Three things. These are
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.360]  the three things I care about. It really matters what order those
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.160]  priorities in, and it has profound implications like one, two, three
[39:44.160 --> 39:51.840]  versus two, one, three. And moving your goal for profitability up one
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.440]  tick inevitably has such profound implications down the road.
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.760]  Immediately, and then down the road, you just end up on a different
[40:01.760 --> 40:05.760]  continent, right? Candy Crush, let's throw them under the bus. That's a
[40:05.760 --> 40:09.920]  big company, part of King Games. Right, they can handle it. That's part of
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.120]  the Activision Blizzard conglomerate that Microsoft has just acquired
[40:15.120 --> 40:21.520]  for I forget how many massive billions of dollars. I don't know, 69, 68.
[40:21.520 --> 40:26.080]  Yeah, that's it. Here's how I remember it. It's like 68.7 billion dollars.
[40:26.080 --> 40:30.960]  And I just in my mind, it's like they came to 69 billion and they're like
[40:30.960 --> 40:35.680]  Microsoft is sort of like the opposite of Elon Musk. And they don't
[40:35.680 --> 40:39.600]  want a funny number as the price. They're like, how about we knock it
[40:39.600 --> 40:45.680]  down to 68.7 and we'll use that. As opposed to if it was Elon and the
[40:45.680 --> 40:49.600]  negotiated price was 68.7, he'd be like, I'll just give you another
[40:49.600 --> 40:54.640]  300 million dollars so we can say it's 69 billion. 69 billion dollars.
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.880]  That's a lot of money for video games. And they make lots of money. Candy
[41:00.880 --> 41:05.120]  Crush is clearly, it stood the test of time, right? It's obviously not a
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.920]  flash in the pan. It's at least a decade old. Oh yeah. It's a good game.
[41:09.920 --> 41:15.280]  It's just a little evil. Well, right. Because once your priority is to
[41:15.280 --> 41:21.200]  keep the money coming, and I think it's fair to say that from their
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.840]  perspective, that's the number one priority of Candy Crush. And I guess
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.160]  maybe number one is to keep it fun or addictive or something, right?
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.360]  Because otherwise the money doesn't come. But that's sort of part and
[41:37.360 --> 41:40.160]  parcel with each other, right? You obviously need the players willing
[41:40.160 --> 41:43.840]  to spend money. But it just seems like that's the top priority.
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.640]  Well, it's all metrics driven. Right.
[41:47.360 --> 41:53.280]  Which is like, I don't know. This is one thing I always hear every time I
[41:53.280 --> 41:56.720]  talk to anybody in the industry, in the mobile industry about stuff.
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.400]  They're always like, what's your retention? What's your day 20? And I
[42:00.400 --> 42:05.520]  always feel like, retention. Why are we even... I understand why we talk
[42:05.520 --> 42:09.360]  about retention, because it is a number that you can tie a lot of value
[42:09.360 --> 42:15.200]  to. But on the other hand, it's like, I don't know. When somebody's like,
[42:15.200 --> 42:18.960]  I love this movie. I'm never like, oh, you love the movie? How many times
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.040]  did you watch it? Did you watch it 300 times? Because all of my movies,
[42:23.040 --> 42:26.800]  I want to make sure everybody watches them 300 times. What does that have
[42:26.800 --> 42:30.880]  to do with the quality of something? It's a very, I don't know. For me,
[42:30.880 --> 42:36.080]  it feels like a very toxic space to think about success through that kind
[42:36.080 --> 42:36.720]  of lens.
[42:36.720 --> 42:42.400]  I don't look at analytics at Daring Fireball. It's been years. I don't
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.960]  even have analytics at the moment. I unhooked Google Analytics, I don't
[42:46.960 --> 42:49.600]  know, at this point, maybe two years ago, and haven't hooked anything up.
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.320]  And there's a couple of privacy-oriented analytics packages that I'm
[42:54.320 --> 42:57.520]  probably going to pick one soon and put it on, because there are some things
[42:57.520 --> 43:01.840]  I would like to know, and I would like to know if something terrible is
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.680]  truly happening. I honest to God, though, don't look. But even when I do
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.000]  put something back on, and even when I had Google Analytics there, any kind
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.360]  of tracking codes, I never tracked which articles were the most important.
[43:17.360 --> 43:22.560]  I mean, maybe in the very early days, like 15, 16, 17 years ago, I used to
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.880]  track referrals, and I could tell if a full article I wrote was getting a
[43:26.880 --> 43:31.280]  lot of links coming in from other blogs. But now that's sort of useless,
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.520]  because that's not really where you get traffic. And I just don't want to
[43:35.520 --> 43:45.520]  know that if I write about my user interface gripes with iOS or Mac, I
[43:45.520 --> 43:50.640]  don't want to know that those posts perform poorly or perform well. But
[43:50.640 --> 43:53.840]  maybe they perform poorly, and people are more interested in my
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.240]  commentary on other stuff. I just want to follow my muse and write the
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.880]  things that I'm interested in. And I don't want to get twisted by knowing
[44:02.880 --> 44:07.120]  that when I write about AppleScript, people's eyes glaze over in the back of
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.160]  their heads, and they skip to the next post. I don't care if you skip,
[44:10.160 --> 44:14.480]  though, right? I don't care when Gruber writes about AppleScript. Just,
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.240]  okay, cool, go to the next article. Close the tab and come back in a
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.360]  couple hours or tomorrow or in a couple days. I'm happy to have you come
[44:21.360 --> 44:24.160]  back, and hopefully I'll have something that will interest you. That's
[44:24.160 --> 44:25.760]  great. I just don't even want to know.
[44:26.560 --> 44:30.960]  I love that I also don't do any analytics. And in fact, NotWords has no
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.120]  analytics packages or anything in it. And those numbers just make me
[44:35.120 --> 44:41.040]  depressed. And I think, yeah, it's a weird secret that you don't need to
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.280]  do analytics to run a successful business or be successful in tech.
[44:45.280 --> 44:48.960]  It's so refreshing. All right, let me take another break here and thank
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.400]  our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Memberful. Speaking about
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.480]  making people happy, Memberful is where you as a creative person can

[45:12.000 --> 45:17.120]  membership program, including custom branding that puts your brand first.
[45:17.120 --> 45:21.360]  Your members, when they sign up, might not even know Memberful is really
[45:21.360 --> 45:25.760]  in the tool chain. That's fine with Memberful. It's not like, oh, you're
[45:25.760 --> 45:29.600]  on a Memberful site. It's nothing like that at all. They keep your brand
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.080]  first. You keep the membership database. If you ever want to move, you

[45:50.080 --> 45:55.280]  keeping the podcast private for members and tons more. And they
[45:55.280 --> 45:58.960]  seamlessly integrate with the tools you already use, things like WordPress
[45:58.960 --> 46:02.720]  or whatever else, all sorts of other systems that are part of that sort
[46:02.720 --> 46:07.200]  of collaborative ecosystem of tools. They also have a world-class support

[46:39.040 --> 46:43.840]  Colors, Jason Snell and Dan Morin's site, and a whole bunch of Relay FM
[46:43.840 --> 46:48.080]  podcasts, the list goes on and on. Here's where you go to find out more.
[46:48.080 --> 46:53.920]  Memberful.com slash talk show. Go to Memberful.com slash talk show.
[46:53.920 --> 46:58.400]  If you have some sort of thing where you would like to create a membership
[46:58.400 --> 47:02.080]  system, go check them out. I cannot recommend them highly enough. It is
[47:02.080 --> 47:05.680]  really terrific. Let's talk not words. Let's go deep. It's the new game.
[47:05.680 --> 47:09.280]  That's why you're here right now, or as I like to say it on the podcast, cannot
[47:09.280 --> 47:15.920]  words. You've done word games before. This is a well you keep coming back to.
[47:15.920 --> 47:20.480]  There was Spell Tower. I forget what else. I mean, in a sense, sort of,
[47:20.480 --> 47:24.400]  Sudoku is sort of a word game, but with numbers, right?
[47:24.400 --> 47:27.600]  It definitely impacted this game, doing the Sudoku game.
[47:27.600 --> 47:33.200]  Right. And good Sudoku was really pretty interesting because that's one
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.000]  that was really interesting to me because Sudoku became a phenomenon,
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.720]  at least to my, I know people, my mom, for example, has books and books
[47:42.720 --> 47:46.640]  and books of Sudoku. She loves doing Sudoku's and books. It's a huge
[47:46.640 --> 47:50.240]  thing. So I know you can play them on paper, but they got computerized
[47:50.240 --> 47:55.040]  pretty early. It's been done so many times. I guess the two before we get,
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.480]  I said, we're going to get to not words, but let's talk about, let's talk
[47:58.480 --> 48:02.320]  about good Sudoku and the solitaire games you've done, because these are
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.880]  two games that have been done to death. Solitaire, arguably, I don't know
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.840]  if this is still true, but I know for a very long time was indisputably
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.000]  the most played video game in the world because it shipped with Microsoft
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.240]  Windows. Yeah. I mean, Solitaire is an incredible game if you back up
[48:22.240 --> 48:27.680]  and think about it. Like, Solitaire is a randomly generated puzzle that
[48:27.680 --> 48:32.000]  was invented hundreds of years before video games, and then video games
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.560]  didn't even really tackle randomly generated puzzles very well until
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.160]  recently, when everybody's become really obsessed with roguelikes and
[48:40.160 --> 48:46.640]  that whole genre space. So what makes you think as somebody whose
[48:46.640 --> 48:52.400]  forte is distinctive games, right? There is a Zack gauginess to a Zack
[48:52.400 --> 48:59.280]  gauge game. It's not like your forte is doing just plain Solitaire, but
[48:59.280 --> 49:03.120]  with the prettiest graphics, which is a fine thing, right? There were some
[49:03.120 --> 49:06.240]  of those I'm sure you remember from the Mac shareware scene where it was
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.000]  like, yeah, sure, Windows has Solitaire built in, but look at the card
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.240]  designs on this game from the Mac, right? I appreciate you saying that my
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.560]  games have a quality that moves from game to game, because I think early
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.400]  on I remember being told in art school that I needed to make sure that I
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.520]  focused on one thing, because if I did lots of different things, nobody
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.400]  would be able to make heads or tails of my work. So it's really nice to be
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.080]  able to make lots of different things and hear that it feels like there's a
[49:34.080 --> 49:38.560]  narrative or a cohesion to it. I think for me, the thing is that I'm not
[49:38.560 --> 49:41.840]  making a Solitaire game because I want to make Solitaire, or even because I
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.720]  like Solitaire. I usually don't like the kinds of games that I make, and
[49:46.720 --> 49:51.920]  then making them as a way that I learn to appreciate them and enjoy the
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.320]  space. Really what I want to do is I want to make games that make people
[49:56.880 --> 50:00.880]  think and become better critical thinkers, because I think critical
[50:00.880 --> 50:05.040]  thinking is the most important skill that a human being can have, and I
[50:05.040 --> 50:07.760]  have a lot of beef with how our educational system works.
[50:09.840 --> 50:15.680]  God, don't get me started. There goes the next hour, but I agree. I do
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.000]  agree.
[50:16.000 --> 50:23.840]  Yeah, it's really weird. We just had a kid, and watching him learn is also
[50:23.840 --> 50:26.720]  just like, every day I'm like, oh my god, I can't believe the way that we
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.880]  teach things. Watching this kid learn is not at all how anybody learns in
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.880]  school. Yeah, so I want to make games that help people become better
[50:34.880 --> 50:39.120]  critical thinkers and also help people learn the language of video games.
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.360]  If you know how video games work, you get access to this amazing literacy
[50:43.360 --> 50:46.720]  that is the same literacy that's used in interactive art, it's the same
[50:46.720 --> 50:51.760]  literacy that's used in avant-garde film and plays, it's like this deep
[50:51.760 --> 50:55.920]  incredible space if you can just teach people how to access it. And one of
[50:55.920 --> 51:00.640]  the things that I love about making games on the iPhone is that the iPhone
[51:00.640 --> 51:07.520]  audience is predominantly normal, non-game people, and being able to make
[51:07.520 --> 51:12.080]  games for them is super interesting to me. And the thing is, what most
[51:12.080 --> 51:16.560]  people know about games is they know about chess pieces and they know
[51:16.560 --> 51:20.240]  about cards and they know about word stuff and they know about billiards
[51:20.240 --> 51:24.880]  maybe. And so the tools that I have at my disposal to try to make games for
[51:24.880 --> 51:29.520]  this audience are a very different set of tools than most people who are
[51:29.520 --> 51:33.200]  making video games feel like they have to work with. And so when I think
[51:33.200 --> 51:36.960]  about games or encounter a game that seems sort of interesting like
[51:36.960 --> 51:42.320]  Solitaire where I go is, okay, well, what's a way that I could make this
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.240]  game much deeper or explore something else, something that's not
[51:46.240 --> 51:50.960]  traditionally explored by what somebody would expect in this category, but
[51:50.960 --> 51:54.800]  then how do I make it look and feel approachable like this game so
[51:54.800 --> 52:00.480]  somebody who normally plays Solitaire would be able to pick up something
[52:00.480 --> 52:04.720]  like Flip-Flop Solitaire or something like Sage Solitaire and have what is
[52:04.720 --> 52:12.240]  really like a cutting-edge game design experience but built upon a stack of
[52:12.240 --> 52:18.000]  things that they understand. I think that point you made a minute ago
[52:18.640 --> 52:23.280]  about how, okay, you've looked at these other Solitaire games but they all
[52:23.280 --> 52:27.600]  dissatisfied you in a certain way. There's something, it's like I kind of, I
[52:27.600 --> 52:32.080]  get how this is a genius game and it was really, really clever back when it
[52:32.080 --> 52:35.600]  was only and could only be played with a physical deck of cards, but
[52:35.600 --> 52:40.160]  something about these video game versions dissatisfied you and how do
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.960]  you scratch that itch so that it satisfies you. And I feel like that's
[52:44.960 --> 52:52.400]  the key to so much creativity, but it also, the creative personality is
[52:52.400 --> 52:57.760]  always full of doubts and so many people think, I would like to make a
[52:57.760 --> 53:00.960]  Solitaire game that's different, but all the other Solitaire games are
[53:00.960 --> 53:04.560]  this way so I guess I shouldn't because there must be that way for a
[53:04.560 --> 53:09.600]  reason. And instead you should see that as an opportunity, you know,
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.480]  like it's the fact that you see you're dissatisfied or you think I could
[53:14.480 --> 53:18.320]  do that, I could do something better than that, then you should do it. It's
[53:18.320 --> 53:22.080]  not a reason not to do it because it's not the way it was always done.
[53:22.880 --> 53:27.360]  Yeah, and also the second part of that that's the key is you should do it.
[53:27.360 --> 53:33.040]  You have to do it. I think something that people might not realize about
[53:33.040 --> 53:37.760]  the games that I make is I probably make 100 prototypes a year and I
[53:37.760 --> 53:43.280]  probably release one game a year. And sometimes the games make it three
[53:43.280 --> 53:46.800]  seconds and then I put them down. And sometimes they make it many hours
[53:46.800 --> 53:50.960]  of work and then we scrap them. You have to both be confident and
[53:50.960 --> 53:55.920]  comfortable with admitting when something sucks, and then if you do
[53:55.920 --> 53:59.120]  that enough when you find something that is good, that is different,
[53:59.120 --> 54:02.560]  it's really obvious because you're like, oh, I enjoy this. This is
[54:02.560 --> 54:06.960]  actually fun to do. In other words, it's sort of like a process of
[54:06.960 --> 54:12.080]  going from an idea that's purely in your head and then you've got to
[54:12.080 --> 54:18.320]  start making it real and it coagulates to become more and more real or
[54:19.120 --> 54:23.200]  it gets to a point you're like, ah, this is a dead end, you know?
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.560]  Yeah, I'll try to walk you through a really quick one. So with flip-flop
[54:28.560 --> 54:33.600]  solitaire, which is kind of like, it was heavily inspired by spider
[54:33.600 --> 54:37.440]  solitaire, which is a really interesting solitaire variant. For years,
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.160]  one of the things that's really interesting to me is this concept of
[54:40.160 --> 54:44.880]  difficulty and how people associate difficulty with games. A lot of games
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.600]  let you pick easy mode or hard mode. Some games try to adapt themselves
[54:49.600 --> 54:53.440]  as you play to a different kind of difficulty. There's like this whole
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.240]  world of thinking about difficulty and challenge in games. And it's
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.320]  something that I think about all the time, and a lot of my games offer
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.680]  a variety of ways to sort of attempt to deal with this problem of trying
[55:07.680 --> 55:12.880]  to find the right difficulty game for the right person. And really bad
[55:12.880 --> 55:16.240]  chess is a really simple example of that because really bad chess,
[55:16.240 --> 55:19.600]  literally your board gets worse and worse the better you get in the game.
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.640]  So it's like teaching you how to play chess in this very friendly way,
[55:24.640 --> 55:27.680]  but it's also very cruel because like at some point in the game, the
[55:27.680 --> 55:31.840]  computer has nine queens and you have no queens, and you're still trying
[55:31.840 --> 55:36.240]  to play the game. So that's like a very clear sort of like exploration
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.400]  into this difficulty question. So what I noticed is I was just looking
[55:40.400 --> 55:43.600]  at games, and I found this game Spider Solitaire. And Spider Solitaire
[55:43.600 --> 55:48.240]  has this phenomenal quality, which is that when you play a game of
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.080]  Spider Solitaire, it has three difficulties. You can play with one suit,
[55:52.080 --> 55:55.840]  which is every card in the deck of cards, you just count them as all the
[55:55.840 --> 55:58.960]  same. It doesn't matter what suit they are. You can play as two suits,
[55:58.960 --> 56:02.960]  which is black and red, or you can play as four suits, which is each suit.
[56:02.960 --> 56:07.120]  And the thing that's interesting is the difficulty of the game is
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.840]  exponential. So almost everybody who plays for any length of time can
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.920]  solve one suit. Two suits much harder, and four suits is almost
[56:15.920 --> 56:19.200]  impossible. Four suits is like you could play Spider Solitaire your
[56:19.200 --> 56:22.480]  whole life, and the day that you solve a four suit, you'll post it to
[56:22.480 --> 56:26.240]  Reddit and be like, I did this. This is amazing. And the thing that's
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.920]  mind-blowing to me, thinking about difficulty and spotting this, is I
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.680]  can't think of any games like that, right? Like most people don't play,
[56:34.320 --> 56:37.440]  you know, a video game on Easy every day, but then some days they're
[56:37.440 --> 56:40.960]  like, well, I'll try hard. I'll just try hard today and then go back to
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.680]  Easy. That's not part of the idea of how we think about difficulty.
[56:46.240 --> 56:50.560]  And so I was just like completely enamored with this small aspect of
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.280]  the game that relates to this big thing that I've been thinking about
[56:53.280 --> 56:56.000]  my whole career, which is how does difficulty work and how do people
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.840]  interact with it? But then to the point that you said earlier, I looked
[56:59.840 --> 57:02.400]  at it and I thought, okay, well, Spider Solitaire, this is like 10
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.680]  piles. It doesn't work on a phone. It's great on a table. How do I
[57:05.680 --> 57:10.080]  condense it down? Maybe if I make it so that you can stack up and down,
[57:10.080 --> 57:14.160]  not just down with your cards, maybe then I can cut the number of
[57:14.160 --> 57:17.440]  piles in half because I've doubled your ability to interact with the
[57:17.440 --> 57:20.320]  game and I'm going to cut the piles down to five and five will fit
[57:20.320 --> 57:24.320]  nicely on a phone. And it turns out that actually making you stack up
[57:24.320 --> 57:28.080]  and down is an entirely interesting, weird direction to go with
[57:28.080 --> 57:31.760]  Solitaire. And you'd think that this tiny little twist wouldn't change
[57:31.760 --> 57:36.240]  the game much, but it entirely shifts the game. And instantly I was
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.520]  playing it with cards. I realized that that was true. And then that was
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.880]  the game. I figured out how to develop it and push it. And I got to
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.240]  explore this thing with difficulty that I've been like looking at my
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.240]  whole career. And then I also got to, you know, try to fit a table game
[57:50.240 --> 57:54.560]  onto a phone and do all the other fun, interesting things about making a
[57:54.560 --> 57:57.920]  game deeper. So you actually prototyped it with just like a deck of
[57:57.920 --> 58:03.040]  cards in your hand and a table? Yes. Yeah. Kind of an advantage to
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.680]  making a Solitaire game of any kind. It's the best thing about cards.
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.880]  A deck of cards is my favorite tool of all time. My desert island game is
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.240]  just a deck of cards. I don't care what the game is. I could entertain
[58:16.240 --> 58:18.480]  myself for a thousand years with a deck of cards.
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.880]  It's so funny. I love sleight of hand magic.
[58:23.600 --> 58:26.800]  Oh my God. The total other area of cards.
[58:26.800 --> 58:32.560]  I don't do it at all. And maybe in some other universe, I would have
[58:32.560 --> 58:36.160]  grown up and tried to teach myself some of it. I don't really think I
[58:36.160 --> 58:43.680]  have any to do it, but as an observer, a fan, an audience member, I love
[58:43.680 --> 58:48.320]  it. And I will watch it. I've watched like the late great Ricky Jay's TV
[58:48.320 --> 58:53.360]  specials, all of them, like six times. Those sleight of hand magicians
[58:53.360 --> 58:56.400]  speak of a deck of, they just love cards and they keep cards with them
[58:56.400 --> 59:00.960]  all the time. And they do unbelievable things. Ricky Jay, you know, used
[59:00.960 --> 59:05.440]  to throw cards. Do you ever see that? Yeah. I saw him live once. It was
[59:05.440 --> 59:08.400]  really an incredible experience. Oh my God. I'm jealous that you saw him
[59:08.400 --> 59:11.440]  live. I wish I would have, but he could throw a card, just a regular
[59:11.440 --> 59:16.080]  card, not like a special, oh, you got a mail order from some outfit in
[59:16.080 --> 59:19.760]  Las Vegas that'll send you these cards that are extra stiff. I mean, go to
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.360]  your local drug store and buy a pack of bicycle playing cards, the kind
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.920]  that everybody knows. And he could throw them at a watermelon across the
[59:27.920 --> 59:33.360]  room and stick them into the rind. And it's scary. He could use a single
[59:33.360 --> 59:36.880]  card as a weapon. And I do like, I like playing card games like poker and
[59:36.880 --> 59:40.800]  blackjack and stuff like that. It's such a wonderful invention. And it
[59:40.800 --> 59:45.840]  always amuses me too in the casinos, the way that, speaking of Candy Crush,
[59:45.840 --> 59:50.240]  but the way they keep inventing new games that use decks of cards. And I
[59:50.240 --> 59:53.520]  always know I never play them, almost never. Maybe you get a couple of
[59:53.520 --> 59:57.680]  drinks with me and I'll play 50 bucks or something. Because I know that
[59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.600]  the only reason a casino would invent a new game is because they make more
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.520]  money from it as opposed to blackjack where you can kind of break even if
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.600]  you know the rules. And so I'm deeply, deeply skeptical and suspicious of
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.720]  any new game. But it fascinates me that they just keep coming up with
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.040]  them. You know, four suits, 13 cards in each suit, and you could just
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.440]  keep making games with them. It's so interesting.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.480]  I love, I had a really fundamental career experience walking around a
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:31.840]  casino for a day, trying my hardest to sort of space out from the
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.920]  manipulative, depressing nature of it and just focus on the games. Those
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.240]  games in casinos are unbelievable. I think one of the things that's the
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.520]  most interesting about casino games is they're one of the only forms of
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:52.160]  artistic expression that has a coherent metric that is the metric, which is
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.480]  how much money do these games make per minute. And so they're all
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:02.880]  like aggressively tuned to this very specific metric that is itself super
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.200]  vague and weird. One of my favorite games in the casino is three-card
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.200]  poker. Are you familiar with that? Yes. Three-card poker is like one of the
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.000]  most beautiful games I've ever seen. It's this game where, if anyone
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.360]  from your audience isn't familiar with it, you basically are dealt three
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.960]  cards, and then you have to decide, or you're dealt two cards, and you
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.520]  have to decide if you're gonna, I think it's two, two or three, you have
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.280]  to decide if you're gonna play the hand or not, and then you get dealt
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.800]  three more cards and that's your hand, and either you win it or you lose
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.920]  it. And what's incredible about it is this moment of decision, it's just
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.840]  random. There's no, you don't know if you're gonna have a good hand or
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.400]  you're gonna have a bad hand, and there's some more complexity to it
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.000]  that I'm not talking about with how the dealer's cards work. But basically
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.360]  it's totally random, but because you have this tiny bit of information
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.480]  and because of the pageantry of the game and how your bets move around
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.640]  on the table, it feels like you're playing this game that is incredibly
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.880]  elegant and interesting and that this moment of choice is super
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.920]  meaningful. And how they did that with nothing, it's incredible.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.400]  I do like that game. I don't play a lot of it, but I like it for that
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:18.560]  reason. It's also very fun to play with a friend or your spouse or
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:24.160]  somebody you know so that you can play together and it's social. I'm not
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.360]  a slot machine player, and I know that they're by far and away the most
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.720]  popular casino games, and I know they make most of the money and I know
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.880]  most people like to play them, but I don't have any fun playing them
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.720]  because there's no decisions. You just hit a button and then you either
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.520]  win or you lose, and I find that to be very boring. There's no social
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.560]  element to it, and I don't want to go off on a casino ramp, but I also
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.240]  love to play craps, but I really only like to play craps if I'm with
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.160]  friends, and it's been a couple of years because of COVID, but I've had
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.320]  times where a bunch of friends, we've gone to Vegas, and playing craps
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.880]  with friends at the same table is amazing because you typically, and
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.840]  there's a gazillion weird bets you can make on a craps table, but if you
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.280]  just sort of bet the pass line, which is, is the person with the dice
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.600]  going to win or lose, you all play together and you win and lose
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.920]  together, which is an incredible game design element. The other thing,
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.320]  I think you'd appreciate that if you think about craps, if craps was not
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.920]  a game that had existed since, I don't know, I don't know when it was
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.440]  invented, but it's ever since the existence of casinos in Las Vegas
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.480]  existed, craps was already part of gambling culture. Nobody would
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.400]  invent that now because the table is huge, it takes up a huge amount of
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.240]  space, and it's manpower heavy. There's at least, I think at least
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:56.400]  three people who, there's the guy in the suit, or the person in the suit
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.200]  who sits down low, and they have like a mirror there, and that person
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.600]  runs the table and looks at everything, and there's the stick man that
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.640]  who literally just has the stick to move the dice around and put them
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.160]  back with the shooter, and two other employees who just make sure all the
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.760]  bets are good and pays off all the bets. So there's like four people at
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.960]  all times at a craps table, but if it hadn't been invented now and you
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:28.240]  and I went to, you know, Caesars and said, we've invented a new game,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:34.880]  it's going to be a 15-foot long table, it's going to require four
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.920]  full-time employees, and the rules are as thick as a book. They would
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:45.600]  just say, get out. But it's great, and you'll see. The other thing too
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.520]  about craps is when you're in a casino, you can always tell when a
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.960]  craps table is hot because it is full, and what happens is people
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.320]  notice that a craps table is hot and people are winning, and then they
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.920]  fill in all the available spots, and then they kind of cram in and take
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.840]  spots that aren't really available, just sort of stick their arm in until
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.400]  the employees are like, yeah, yeah, this table's full, you can't play,
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.920]  you got to wait. But then people will stand behind the table because
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.360]  they're hoping while the table's hot that they can join in, and then
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.200]  when the shooter hits their number again, the table just erupts like
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.200]  their team just hit a home run in a close baseball game, and it fills
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.440]  the whole casino with this certain noise that is very human, very
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.840]  social, and very different from the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.120]  of the slot machines just sort of endlessly beeping and bopping.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.920]  I love craps. I don't like to play it, but I really like to go into
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.480]  casinos with friends and watch them play it. And again, yeah, the thing
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.320]  about craps is it's just this major victory for the narrative
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:53.200]  generation of a game. It's just all narrative, and that narrative is
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.640]  so thrilling and irresistible to be a part of, and it has this
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.360]  incredible mechanic where you can bet on a number, and every time the
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.320]  shooter hits that number, you get paid. So it's like you've created a
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.000]  little money factory, and everybody's got their own little factories.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.280]  And one thing that I realized when I got into craps is like, craps
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.360]  must have been a major inspiration for Settlers of Catan, which is
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.880]  like the biggest American board game since Monopoly. It's the same
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.560]  mechanic. You're constructing little cities on numbers, and when
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.320]  those numbers get rolled, you get paid.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.440]  Yeah, that's a good analogy. I'm familiar with the game enough to
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.040]  see what you mean. That's pretty good. That is, the times that I've
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.160]  won money, like significant amount, like holy crap, look how much
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.080]  chips I have. I better leave. I better get, let's go. It's always
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.520]  because I had like money on the six and the eight while some
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.520]  shooters, you know, as like a 10, which is sort of a rare number. So
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.640]  in other words, the shooter is just sitting there shooting over and
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.800]  over again until they get another 10, at which point they win and all
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.120]  the bets are paid off and everything's over and we start all over
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:00.560]  again, or they roll the dreaded seven and then they lose and all the
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.520]  bets, every bet is cleared off the felt and it all goes to the
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.520]  casino. And in the meantime, while you're waiting for the shooter to
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.880]  either roll a seven and lose or hit another 10 and win, if they keep
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.840]  rolling sixes and eights in there, you just keep getting paid and you
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.720]  can just leave your bet up there. And it just keeps coming. It just
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.240]  keeps coming and coming and coming. And those are the times where it's
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.080]  like some kid just keeps shooting the dice and just isn't winning,
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.960]  isn't losing. And you've got like the six and the eight or some,
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.960]  whatever numbers, whatever your lucky numbers are. And all of a
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.160]  sudden you've got this giant stack of chips and it's like, how did this
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.800]  happen? It's amazing. And it feels like the whole universe is just
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:41.120]  smiling upon you. And it's, of course, I know, I know in my mind that
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:46.480]  it's just stupid, stupid statistical luck and that they are guaranteed
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:53.440]  the most honest dice in the universe. But you can't help but feel that
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.000]  there is a narrative at play, right? And it's the same thing when a
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.120]  craps table is ice cold. It's like, oh, this table stinks.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.040]  Yeah. Yeah. And just in case I don't feel like I'm an idiot when I
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.240]  re-listen to this later, I know that Catan is not an American
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.960]  board game, but it was an American board game phenomenon.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.720]  Right, right. Let's talk, so that leads us to craps, of course, leads
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.120]  us directly to Not Words, the crosswords game. Not Words is in a,
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.240]  maybe in a nut. I quoted when I linked to it on Daring Fireball over
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.440]  the weekend, I quoted your description and you don't mention this, but
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.720]  I would just say, I think most people would describe it as a crossword
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.200]  game without clues. Yes.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:38.560]  Which sounds, sounds impossible at first. Right. Right. It sounds like
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.520]  there's not even a game. Right.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.280]  The trick is how do you do this without clues? They're just English
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.240]  words, the typical words that would be in a crossword puzzle as you
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.360]  know it. And the crossword, the board game, the board, if you would
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.200]  call it, looks like it could be a regular crossword game where you
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.920]  would play it with clues at first glance, but then there's little sub
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.360]  shapes within the game, sort of like Tetris pieces, but they're not
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.320]  necessarily, you know, Tetris pieces famously are all four squares.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.800]  That's the tet in Tetris. You know, they could be three, they could be
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.160]  five. I don't know. What's the, what's the biggest chunk that that's
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.680]  allowed in Not Words? Are there six? I think they go up to seven in puzzles,
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.560]  but yeah, it's two to seven in general. Right. It might be like a
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.720]  little L shape. It might be a little square. It's like any kind of
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.680]  imaginable little shape of two to seven squares. And then in the, in the
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.080]  corner of that piece, it'll tell you these, let's just say it's a little
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.880]  four square shape. It'll tell you these four squares consist of these
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.480]  four letters. There may not be a complete word. In fact, typically
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.040]  there's no complete word in that piece. You just have to use it combined
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.360]  with the adjacent ones to make words. You pick it up pretty quickly, which
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.800]  again is sort of a hallmark of your games where you don't need to read a
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.440]  lot of rules to pick it up and start playing. And I think to touch on one
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.760]  of your previous points, that's why sort of playing off these classic
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:20.160]  forms like billiards and crosswords and solitaire, people already know the
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.240]  order of a deck of cards, that a jack is less than a queen is less than a
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.680]  king. And they know that a crossword puzzle gets filled in with words. So
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:35.280]  you're starting with this sort of foundational knowledge. How do you
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.680]  describe not words? Yeah. I mean, I think you did a pretty good job. It's
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.400]  the really simple description. If people have this backing is it's kind
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.640]  of like Ken Ken meets crosswords, but if you've never played Ken Ken, then
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.760]  yeah, it's basically a crossword puzzle where the whole grid is split up
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.760]  into zones. And then in those zones, you have a couple of letters that you
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.280]  have to distribute, and then you have to make it so that all of the across
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.960]  and down words are real words. So you're just sort of taking these little
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.080]  pieces and untangling these kind of partial anagrams to create these full
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.800]  words. You describe each puzzle may seem difficult at first, but like all
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.920]  my favorite newspaper puzzles, it gets easier as you progress. And I thought
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.720]  that was an interesting way to describe it, that it is sort of like a
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.800]  newspaper puzzle. I used to love back when I read a daily newspaper every
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.680]  day, I did the jumble every day. That was, it's such a stupid game. I don't
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.040]  do regular crossword puzzles because they take too long and I get bored.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.440]  I've never been a fan, but the jumble was good because sometimes you could
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.640]  solve it in a minute if you got lucky. And usually two or three minutes, you
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.360]  should be able to get the jumble. You know, the jumble for people who don't
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.160]  know was, I think, five five-letter words every day. I think there were
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.960]  five, which is sort of reminiscent of jumble. And they would just be
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.600]  scrambled, just five scrambled words. And there'd be a little cartoon to go
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.400]  with it, with a caption. And then within those five words where you just
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:07.520]  unscramble the anagrams to make words, there would be circles in different
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:12.560]  spots. And then once you've solved all five, the five that are circled is one
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:19.920]  more anagram to solve. And then that one is the clever pun to the cartoon
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.720]  that goes with it. Do you remember jumble or am I telling you about a
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.240]  game? No, I do remember it and I like it. I have a like sort of armchair,
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.880]  loose obsession with newspaper puzzles for a lot of different reasons, but
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:40.400]  probably because I've been working in this space for so long. But yeah, for
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.360]  my whole career, basically, I've had this obsession with these very simple
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.680]  kinds of puzzles that are out there. I think a really good example is
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.440]  Sudoku. That's why I worked in it. But also Picross or nanograms, if people
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.880]  are familiar with it. There's one called To No Touch that they started
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.040]  running in the Times this year. It's basically there's this world of these
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.040]  logic puzzles that you can print on a sheet of paper, and that's the whole
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.520]  game, and each one is a unique puzzle every day, and you look at it, and at
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:17.200]  first it seems impossible, and then you start working it, and as you put
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.320]  answers in, those answers form these like very dramatic constraints onto
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.520]  the future of the puzzle. And I think if you look at a crossword puzzle, if
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.840]  you put one word in a crossword puzzle, that really doesn't do much for your
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.400]  other answers, right? Like maybe you get one letter on one word, and so okay,
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.960]  maybe I've got three words in, and that gives me enough that I can find
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.680]  something. But it's not like dramatically reducing the possibility space of what
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.560]  words could go in this thing or helping you. But in Sudoku, if you put in one
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.600]  number, that can like change the whole puzzle. It can it affects the row, it
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.840]  affects the column, it affects its box, it might give you it might affect
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.120]  something with another one of the same number that gives you another answer
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.440]  that affects another. It's like this giant cascade of like information and
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:09.280]  ideas that come out of just this one small thing. And I, in my mind, over the
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.200]  years of thinking about this, I kind of call it like a possibility funnel. So
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.480]  as you get closer to the end of the puzzle, that funnel shrinks and shrinks
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.280]  and shrinks until by the end it's inevitable that you would solve the
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.160]  puzzle. But it still feels exciting because you're at the like climax of
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.080]  this journey that you've taken with this puzzle and designing a game that
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:33.440]  has that, that also is incredibly simple and you can look at it and see it and
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.600]  it fits on a piece of paper. All those qualities together is just like a
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:44.240]  nightmare and it's so hard and I sort of still am a little reeling that we
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.440]  found a new one because this is just something I've like as a design goal, as
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.800]  a game designer, it's been something for a very long time.
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.560]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I think you could definitely play NotWords on paper. I think the biggest
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.560]  problem would be you definitely, I would at least, need to erase a lot. And
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.280]  I mean this sincerely, I'm not even making a joke, but like it would be, the
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.160]  problem with NotWords as a newspaper game would be that newspaper is such
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.240]  crap paper that erasing, you'd wear through the paper pretty quickly. It is
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.720]  true and NotWords absolutely has that feel to it where it's like I started
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.040]  playing and it's like the sort of onboarding game or maybe there's a
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.000]  couple or very small and you know, because it's sort of like play this one
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.280]  which is really small and easy to get the feel for it. And then it's like,
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.800]  okay, here's a real daily puzzle. And I was like, oh my God, this is impossible.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.280]  I'm never going to get this. I just, this is, my brain doesn't work this way.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.520]  And I just sit there and hunt and I'm like, oh, well, here's one where it has
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.680]  to, there has to be a three-letter word right here out of this group, all in
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.960]  this thing. And the only three-letter word out of these four letters, I think
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:05.280]  the only one that you could make is, hey, H-E-Y. That's it. There's no, yeah,
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.200]  there's no other possibility here. Okay, well then now I've got a word. And,
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.880]  oh, well, this other spot has to be the eye, even though it goes in a different
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.160]  direction. And you start finding these spots in the puzzle where you can, you
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.440]  could definitely make a conclusion. Or this is the part where you need the
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.440]  eraser. It's like, oh, I could see two words out of this group right here. All
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.040]  right. I'll guess coma. All right. And then it's like, oh God, I think I made a
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.920]  mistake with coma. I got to delete that. Now I got to delete this. I got to
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:39.040]  delete that and put a different word in that spot. And it's, oh, okay. Yeah.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.160]  Now if I do that, then this becomes obvious and it's pretty easy to make a
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.640]  word. And it's, you know, like if you get yourself in a spot where you think
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.200]  you've got a couple of words in not words, but it leaves you with a new word
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.200]  that starts N-V. You're like, well, I've obviously made some sort of terrible
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.680]  mistake because I don't need to look in the unabridged dictionary. There's
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.960]  definitely no word that starts N-V. And I'll just say that then you get
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:12.160]  towards the end and this, what I thought was I am never going to finish this one.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.160]  This is impossible. But then I get towards the end and I'm like, I guarantee
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.080]  I'm going to, I know I'm going to beat this, but I need to, I need to see it to
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.560]  completion. I need to fill in the very last square, even though in my gut, I
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.080]  feel a hundred percent certain now I'm going to beat this in the next minute or
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.000]  two, but I'm not just going to put the game down before I've actually put the
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.600]  very last letter in and gotten a beep and a bop from the game to tell me I
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.880]  beat it. Yeah, I think that's the, that's part of the joy of newspaper puzzles is
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:48.480]  that when they're done, you can see it. It's like they're filled in, you've
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:52.560]  filled in all the letters. And getting to that point is really different from
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.680]  something like Solitaire, where like most Solitaire games, once you know
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.960]  you're about to win, a button pops up and you go boop and the computer does
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.240]  everything for you. But with newspaper games, there's something special about
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.640]  being able to see it. And yeah, and that funnel, I'm so glad, I'm so happy to
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.120]  hear that that's been your experience with it. That's exactly the kind of
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:15.360]  experience that we're going for. And I think something that I was really
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.240]  surprised to learn working with Sudoku on Good Sudoku, to talk to another
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.560]  thing that you hit on a little bit, is this idea of like, you think Sudoku is a
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.960]  beautiful game because the rules are really elegant, but the reality is most
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:35.600]  Sudoku puzzles are terrible. Like 99% of like numbers that you put in, they
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.680]  don't even work, they're not even puzzles. And then in that 1% of things
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.600]  that are actually Sudoku puzzles, many of them are impossible or too hard. The
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.840]  way that you actually get to a good Sudoku is by building a generator that's
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.840]  really smart, that knows how to solve it, that knows how to identify the little
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.080]  diamonds in the rough of possibility space. And so if we were to do a Not
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.200]  Words newspaper puzzle, those puzzles might look quite different than the
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.120]  puzzles that we put in the game. They might have more spots that are like
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:07.280]  anchor points where you can say something for sure to try to like reduce
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.920]  the space of erasing and things like that. How do you guys generate the
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:18.240]  puzzles for Not Words? That's a very complicated question. We spent a really
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.240]  long time building the generator. The game was in development for, I think,
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.520]  probably six or seven months, and I would say we probably spent four of
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.200]  those months building a generator. Jack, my partner on the project, has had
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.840]  a lot of practice because we built good Sudoku and we figured out how to
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.440]  build one of the best Sudoku generators in the world, which is, you know,
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.880]  there's not any documentation really on how to do that, so we kind of had to
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.200]  reverse engineer it. And I think that set of skills really paid off here.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:48.560]  When we prototyped the game, I originally prototyped it on a piece of
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.560]  paper, and as Jack started building the generator, I would, with some game
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.720]  design friends, we would make puzzles by hand for each other and figure out
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.760]  which kind of puzzles were good and what things were interesting. And then
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.040]  Jack would build a generator, and we would look at what the puzzles looked
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.240]  like and compare them with our hand-built puzzles and say, okay, well,
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.080]  is there some kind of rule we can come up with for the computer to teach it
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.600]  what is interesting about this puzzle that's not interesting about the
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.120]  puzzle that it generated? And so Jack and I went back and forth on that
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.880]  where he was sort of the interface to this complicated algorithm, and then
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.000]  I was the hand-built design interface to, like, what we knew was right about
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.880]  the puzzles, and we just went back and forth for a really long time, and
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:35.520]  Jack came up with some really clever algorithm ideas, and we eventually got
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.720]  the generator to a space where it was generating really great puzzles.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:45.760]  Does that mean that because you can trust the generator that the puzzle is
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.320]  solvable, that you don't have to human test every single puzzle that goes into
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:52.800]  not words?
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.280]  Yeah, and in fact it means a little bit more than that. We do some stuff that
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.560]  probably seems like it's a magical result of the rules. That actually isn't.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.240]  So, for example, we do a lot ofone of our metrics in terms of our puzzle
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.480]  generation has to do with possible permutations that can exist within the
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:18.400]  puzzle. And so we, in the standard puzzles in the game, are very restrictive
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.760]  of how many permutations can exist. So, like, for example, if you've put in two
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.840]  different six-letter words that interact with each other, they're right.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.480]  Like, they have to be right because we don't allow for puzzles that have that
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.680]  size words that are interacting that are, like, not working. And so doing
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.680]  that, like, cutting out those, like, kinds of puzzle structures is a big part
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:49.280]  of what makes that possibility space funnel happens. It's like removing those
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.560]  options is why when you put in a bunch of words they're usually correct except
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.760]  maybe one of them's wrong in this other way and then you figure that out. And
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.440]  we're careful about how we adjust that because in the game there's a kind of
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.240]  puzzle called a twist puzzle that has some numbers that count how many vowels
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.920]  are in each row or column that they're related to. And in those puzzles we
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.560]  allow a lot more permutations but still only one for the answer. So you're kind
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:18.240]  of incentivized to use those numbers as a tool for solving the puzzle.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.000]  What do you guys use to build, like, the word list?
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.840]  So we use Wordnik, which is an open-source word list that you can
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:33.040]  license for games. And then over the years after making a lot of word games
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.800]  I've sort of compiled a lot of lists, including lists around how well-known
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.760]  words are.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.720]  Oh, yeah, that's interesting. That's really interesting.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.080]  I have lists of, like, hyper-commonly known words and then slightly less
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.240]  known words, and we use those also as a basis of generation. So you'll notice
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.080]  in not words as you go throughout the week, the Friday, Saturday, Sunday
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.400]  puzzles often include more words that are a little bit less known. Or even in
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:03.520]  the puzzle books, one of our puzzle types is uncommon words, and that puzzle
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.920]  is also filled with words that are less likely to be super commonly known.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:12.880]  Yeah, I guess because I played over the weekend, in anticipation of this,
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.720]  there was a three-letter wordI'm going to forget itit was like T-E-C or T-A-C,
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.840]  and I was like, I don't know, that doesn't look like a word to me. But one
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.160]  of the things is if you can try the word, there's no penalty for trying a
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.680]  word that isn't a word, it just gives you a little squiggle out to say
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.000]  that's not a legit word. So if it says that's a word, it's not confirming
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.480]  that you've put the right word in, it's just confirming this is considered
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:44.960]  within not words a legitimate word to play. But one of my favorite little
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.040]  features, because otherwise it would drive me nuts, on a phone in particular,
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:52.000]  you don't want to be switching back and forth while you're playing a game
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.640]  to, for me, a dictionary app. If there's a word that I don't know what it
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.400]  means, I want to look it up, and you can always, there's just a little
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:07.760]  dictionary lookup button once you've completed a word, and then, I guess
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:13.040]  it's based on which square has input focus right now, if you wanted to
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.720]  change that square. And if it is part of a complete word, you could just
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.960]  hit the dictionary button, and it'll tell you the definition from which
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.440]  dictionary, I don't know if you have multiple sources, it seems like most
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.120]  of the definitions come from which dictionary, which I guess is open
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:27.600]  source?
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.200]  Yeah, it's from Wordnik, and Wordnik is a multi-source open source
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:35.200]  dictionary, so sometimes they'll come from Wordnik or a variety of other
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.680]  ones, but it's all built in the same sort of word list on our end. And
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.760]  yeah, that's a great, your point about not wanting to open up the
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.160]  dictionary on your phone is, I really appreciate that point. I think that's
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.520]  something I try to be super cognizant of with building word games, and it's
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.680]  something I've noticed when, like, something like, Myst will get a port,
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.960]  and suddenly Myst is on the phone, or something like that. I always think
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.440]  this is so frustrating because the phone is my notebook, or it is my
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  dictionary. If I'm playing a game on the computer and I have some kind of
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.480]  note that I have to take down, I'll take a photo of it with my phone or
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.000]  I'll write it down with my phone. So I always try to be very cognizant of,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.800]  if I'm making a game for the phone, this is in the place of the player's
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.640]  notebook or reference tool, and I want to make sure that anything that they
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.400]  would have to write down or look up or anything like that would be included
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.240]  in the game, because otherwise, like, people aren't walking around with two
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.960]  phones to look up definitions and not words.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.800]  Right. So, you know, it's so convenient and it's so satisfying, because maybe
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.760]  you didn't even guess it, because you don't know the word. This isn't the
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.360]  word. I just looked it up while we were talking here, but tech, T-E-C,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.600]  is a word. It's some kind of mid-century shorthand for the word
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.640]  detective. That wasn't the word I'm thinking of. It was something like
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.080]  that, though. But I've never heard of T-E-C either. Now I'm ready for it and
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.240]  not words. But let's say you end up, it's just like any other crossword
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.000]  puzzle, where you can end up filling in a word without ever guessing the clue
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.240]  because you fill in all the other words in the other direction. And, you know,
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.920]  so let's say it's T-E-C across, but you've filled in all the ones that go
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.160]  down, and now you've got it, and it says it's a word, and you're like,
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.120]  well, what the hell does that mean? Boom. You're like two taps away from,
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.440]  oh, okay, it's like a mid-century nickname for a police detective. Oh,
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.160]  interesting. And now you've learned a word.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.520]  One of the things that I'm really excited about about not words is that it
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.640]  has that quality of, because of the funnel, being able to allow you to
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.680]  enter in words that you didn't know and discover them. And that's a very
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.320]  uncommon quality on a word game. Like, I think even if you think about,
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.880]  like, Wordle, which is basically the most accessible or approachable word
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.880]  game that I've ever seen, where almost everybody solves Wordle almost every
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.200]  day. Even in that, if you didn't know the word, it would be really hard to
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.720]  solve Wordle despite all of the clues, because the game is about recall and
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.320]  without being able to identify this word that you know about. And so being
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.240]  able to have clues and structured puzzles in not words that get you to
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.080]  words that you didn't know, even though you'd think that that would be
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.800]  impossible, it's really cool. And so being able to look up them and learn
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.400]  definitions of strange words, I always get really excited when that happens
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.840]  to me in one of the puzzles.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.800]  So, yeah, you mentioned when we first got in touch about doing the show and
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.000]  you got me on the beta of not words a couple weeks ago, you mentioned
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.400]  Wordle. I mean, if we're going to talk games and word games, I mean, how
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.400]  can we not at least talk about Wordle a little? I love it. I know it's so
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:44.080]  stupid. I play every day. But here's one of the things that is so fun and
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.240]  interesting about Wordle. So my sister's two years younger than me. My
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.520]  parents are both, they're, you know, my dad's, I think, 84. And my mom's,
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.720]  like, in her late 70s. But they're both very healthy. We're so lucky that
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.040]  everybody's healthy and around. And now all four of us play Wordle every
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.200]  day. And we have a group chat and an iMessage. And we post our lines. And
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:09.360]  my mom sends, like, a trophy emoji to whoever solves it in the least words.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.640]  And, you know, we have a good family. And I certainly love my parents. I
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.240]  talk to my dad on the phone a lot. But we have never had a continuous group
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.520]  chat, the four of us, that was active for so long. And now it's there every
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:28.880]  single day. We all play. And I can't, I don't know. I never, it's actually
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.600]  improved our lives in a certain way. It really has. Like, and then, you know,
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.120]  because it's, and it's mostly filled with Wordle talk, you know, line four,
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.600]  line three. All right. Trophy goes to Bob today. But, you know, you can put
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.800]  other things in there, right? And so now we've got, like, this active
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.200]  social, passively active social channel, which is why group chats are so
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.400]  great. What a great thing. And there's absolutely no, you know, part of the
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.120]  charm of it. It wasn't just that it's free. It wasn't just that it was on the
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.080]  web, but that there's no, it's not even possible to keep playing. Like, you
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.680]  have to wait till midnight. And of course, if you really want to, you
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.760]  can, because now there are more Wordle clones than you could possibly count.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.400]  So if you really want to play a Wordle-like game for an hour and just
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.600]  keep beating puzzles, you know, the app store is chock full of options for
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.160]  you. You know, you can do it. It's not like Josh Wardle, the creator of the
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.280]  original Wordle, or now the New York Times, who bought it from him and own
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.720]  it. They're not being mean by keeping you from doing it, but they're just
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.360]  saying, in our version of the game, you play once, you solve it, and, you
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.360]  know, come back tomorrow. And I think that is such a wonderful mechanic. It's
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.480]  so, and it's, you know, literally the opposite of Candy Crush.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.240]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of things I love in that story. I totally agree
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.200]  about that mechanic, and that was actually a major influence on how we
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:56.080]  thought about what the flow of how someone would interact with NotWords
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.160]  would be. That's definitely the main reason why we put so much focus on it
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:05.520]  being a daily puzzle, and we put up a lot of friction around you playing
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.840]  more than the daily. We have two dailies, and you can, if you paid for it,
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.160]  you can go back in history and play as many puzzles as you want, but it's
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:18.800]  very focused around just asking you to do the daily every day. And that was
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.760]  directly inspired by Wordle and thinking about that structure, because it
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:28.640]  is such a compelling way to interact with something, and I think Josh was
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.800]  really correct that that is the most fun way to play Wordle, which is great.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.840]  You'd never find that by digging into your metrics.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.920]  I would be bored to tears playing three Wordles in a row. I would. I honestly
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.480]  would. And I did it because I wrote about the ripoffs, and the ripoffs
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.760]  weren't about the mechanics. The thing I wrote about was people actually
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:55.680]  stealing the name Wordle, which is clearly wrong, and to some extent
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:59.600]  stealing the exact look of the game, which is like, come on, there's like a
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.680]  zillion billion ways that you could make this look, even if it's the same
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.720]  mechanics. Come on, come up with your own look. And then after that, if you
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.520]  want to take the mechanics, but I've played with those games, and it's like,
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.960]  oh my God, this game that I love to play every morning while I drink my
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.760]  coffee, it bores me to tears doing two.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.160]  And how is that possible? It's just two.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.120]  I don't know. I don't know, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to play
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.280]  again tomorrow morning, you know? It really is interesting. And it's so
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:32.400]  healthy. It must be a good feeling. And part of NotWords is, okay, the
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.720]  daily puzzles certainly take significantly more time than solving a
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.320]  Wordle. It's, you know, it's a little bit more akin to a crossword puzzle,
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.760]  but smaller, you know, than like the daily newspaper crossword puzzle.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.680]  But then you finish it, and it's done, it's correct, and you get the
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.160]  animation and audio feedback to tell you that you've solved it. And there's
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.560]  absolutely no mechanic telling you, and now instantly, let's roll into this
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:00.560]  game. You know, keep going, keep going, keep playing, keep playing, keep
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:05.040]  playing until your phone battery's dead. There's nothing like that. If you'd
[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:08.880]  like to, you can. But, you know, there's no pressure, and there's no pushing
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.560]  or steering you to keep going. Yeah, we really wanted to focus on the
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.880]  daily and give you time to recuperate, especially because some of the
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.880]  weekend puzzles are longer, and we wanted it to still be exciting to open
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.040]  it up and get to that. I think also part of it was, like, my game design
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.880]  process is I work on a game, and then I just play it for hundreds of hours
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.240]  until I'm sure that I'm bored of it, and then I think, what else could I
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.040]  do? And for Not Words, that was when I came up with the twist mode. But it
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:45.440]  was also this sort of funny side effect where we were really only halfway
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:49.280]  through the generation process when I was playing a ton, a ton, a ton of
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:54.240]  Not Words hours a day. And I think at that point, our puzzle seemed really
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.480]  good, because it was this very fresh mechanic, and it was really exciting
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:04.320]  to see where it went, but they actually weren't that good. And so I played 40
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:08.240]  hours of mediocre Not Words puzzles, and I thought, you know what, we can't
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.520]  have people playing Ten of These a day. We just gotta have them play one,
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:15.520]  because otherwise they're gonna feel the malaise that I feel. And now, of
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.720]  course, the puzzles are much better, and I do feel like people could
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.080]  probably play more if they wanted, but they're still gonna hit that burnout
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.560]  at some point, no matter what. And it made me feel like this approach was
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.400]  just a much healthier and more interesting approach, and an approach
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.920]  that will make you feel happier about the time you're spending with the
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.400]  game.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.880]  Really mediocre Not Words. There's your game. So let's talk about how the
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.240]  game makes money. So for 12 bucks, $11.99, you can... I'm going by the app
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:50.400]  store prices. $11.99, you can pay for the full game, and for $5 a year, $4.99,
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.640]  you get a pro subscription. What's the difference?
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.880]  So, I mean, there's no difference. It's do you hate subscriptions, or do you
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.760]  think you're going to be playing for more than three years, I guess?
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.200]  In other words, you could pay 12 bucks once and just buy the game, and now
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.840]  you're in like Flynn. You've got it. You're gold. Or if you'd prefer, if
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:13.760]  you'd rather just pay five bucks for the next year and see if you like it
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.040]  again next year, you could do that.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.760]  Yeah, and there's a one-week free trial, so if you don't even know, you can
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.040]  do a free trial.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.880]  But you can also play for free forever, to some degree, and what are the
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.080]  limits on the free game?
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.640]  Yeah, so for free, we just give you basically something that looks like
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.680]  what Wordle gave you. We give you the daily puzzle every day, and you can
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.920]  play it every day, and if you miss one, you can't go back and play it
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:47.040]  again, but you can play the puzzle on the day every day, and we give you
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.640]  10 extra puzzles in the puzzle book a month, so there's a little bit extra
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.680]  if you want to kind of play more than one a couple days, and that's it, and
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.000]  there's no ads or anything. We don't collect any data. We don't generate
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.320]  any analytics. It's just a fun game that you can play totally for free.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:12.560]  So the no ads thing, to me, that's how I would do it too, but it's unusual?
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.400]  I mean, what's the thinking there?
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:20.640]  Well, so it's actually been, I mean, I've been making games for free that have
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.920]  ads in them for probably six years now. There was a point where I realized
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.920]  I would have to stop selling my games as a premium because I was being
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.000]  knocked off within 24 hours, and this was right around, I don't know if you
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.760]  remember or were familiar with the Threes 2048 thing?
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.840]  Yeah, I remember Threes.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.960]  So Threes was this, like, bespoke indie game that a bunch of my friends
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.520]  made, and it was this real phenomenon. And then, like, a week into it, this
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:53.040]  game 2048 came out that was basically, like, heavily influenced by Threes,
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.120]  a little different, but heavily influenced and totally free and just had
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.440]  a lot of ads. And it basically, that game made, like, a hundred times the
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.880]  revenue that Threes made, even though Threes, like, came up with this whole
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:09.200]  idea and this new mechanic of interacting with things. And so I think
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.760]  being on the App Store, I looked at that and was like, well, geez, that's
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.960]  going to happen to me if I don't make my games free, so I need to think
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.120]  through how I can do free and, you know, how to make money with ads and
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.120]  rethink my whole process of, you know, what it looks like for somebody to be
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.840]  playing my game and have options and make sure that nobody can undercut
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:33.680]  me. And I did that for a while. You know, I don't know for sure that I'm
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.960]  never going to do ads again, but there's a lot of stuff that being in the
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.720]  ad ecosystem, I started to discover that really bothered me. Ads are, the
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.240]  libraries are big, so your, your, your apps get big. They show good ads
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.400]  right at the start, but the longer your app is on the store, the worse the
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.480]  ads get. And then all of a sudden they're, like, hawking weird drugs and
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.320]  weight loss things, even if you told them not to. They're, like, crashing
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.160]  your app and giving horrible bugs. Advertisers are always trying to scam
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.600]  the people who are clicking on their ads, and they try everything they
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.760]  can to get around the restrictions by ad providers. And the person who
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.800]  gets taken advantage of in that situation is, like, me and the people
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.080]  who are playing my games. There was a whole thing where a lot of ad
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.760]  providers were just copying your clipboard, and they didn't tell anyone,
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.400]  and they certainly didn't tell me. And I was, like, oh my God, I can't
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:31.520]  believe this is happening. This is, like, I don't want to be a part of
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.440]  this. So I've really wanted to get away from ads for a very long time,
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.840]  but it's been tough because when I look back at my revenue, on most of
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:44.320]  my games, ads are accounting for 20 to 50 percent of the revenue from
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.880]  games. And so it's very difficult to be able to really say, like, to look
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.000]  at your numbers and be, like, oh, you know, I can't run a business if I
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.080]  don't do this. This is part of the ecosystem, and it's part of what
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.720]  people come to expect from games. And they'll get mad at you. They
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:03.040]  won't play a game that they have to pay for, but they're happy to pay
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.000]  to play these games that, like, shove a thousand ads in your face.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.680]  And so it was very frustrating. And this game, we felt like this is a
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.880]  really special game, and we really want to present it in a way that is
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:20.800]  impressive and maybe a little bit more generous than ever. It's also a
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.560]  game that we only want people to play once a day, so we wouldn't really
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.960]  be getting very much ad revenue from that anyway. And it's a way that we
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.880]  can really provide a very fair ask when we're asking people to play
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:39.440]  this, right? If you're going to enjoy a game once a day, then we can
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.000]  easily kind of be like, all right, well, that's all you get then if
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.640]  you're playing the free version. We're giving you what really feels
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.480]  like a full game, even though it's very restricted and small. And that
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.120]  kind of gave us this opportunity to try this new adventure. And so we
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.040]  thought, you know what, maybe we can't make money from ads in this game,
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.280]  but what if we raise the price really substantially? $12 is a lot more
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.960]  than we typically charge. And then maybe with subscriptions, we can make
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.720]  up for that and give people another way that they could still spend
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.160]  closer to what we usually charge on the game. And it's been really
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.880]  amazing. I've been really surprised by how many people have just
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.160]  gotten the $12 thing. Nobody has ever complained about the price so
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.320]  far. Everybody seems really happy with it, and people seem to be
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.280]  subscribing also. So it's been a really positive experience.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.840]  Well, that's awesome to hear because nobody is outside the seven-day
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.720]  free trial yet, right? Although I guess that would be, I guess you
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.920]  get the seven-day free trial through paying, right?
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.240]  No, when I look at my analytics, it's like we've made like zero
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.640]  dollars from subscriptions because everybody's in the trial.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:55.200]  Right. But that is great to hear. Is part of the thinking, I know we've
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.320]  spent so much time talking about how you're like, you really are,
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.000]  you're an artist who's driven by trying to make the coolest thing,
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.880]  but is part of the thinking like with Threes getting, let's just say
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.920]  they got ripped off. I remember writing about it. I remember at least
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:13.040]  I just looked it up. I definitely linked to Threes back in 2014 because
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.000]  I love the game. It was so much fun, or it still is, but like a lot of
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.520]  games, you just sort of play. I don't know. I played myself out of it.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.960]  I did the same thing with Letterpress, which I loved, but eventually I
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.920]  was just like, and I was pretty good at Letterpress. I don't know
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:33.680]  why. There's some combination of the strategy and the word knowledge.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.920]  I was really good at boxing people in, and I've heard Go players talk
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.440]  about that, and that Go is notoriously more difficult than chess for
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.880]  computers to beat the top human players because top Go players have
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.200]  an intuition. I had like a weird Letterpress intuition, and it just
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.080]  worked in my favor.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.600]  So envious of that. That's a game that I always wished I was good at.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.520]  And I'm usually really bad at games. I'm not a great word game player,
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.040]  but somehow Letterpress really fell in my sweet spot, and I was really
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.360]  good. And then eventually I got introduced to a friend of a friend who
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:10.320]  works at Apple, and because she's still at Apple, I'm not going to
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.440]  mention her name, but she could beat me like Neo dodging bullets.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.320]  And I was like, Oh my God. And it's not what drove me away from
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:24.000]  Letterpress, but it was like, I at least realized, okay, this is how
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.480]  good you can be. It was very interesting. It's like becoming a very
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:32.960]  good, really good high school tennis player, and then you play a pro,
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.160]  and it's like, Oh, okay. There you go. I'm just going to be a
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.840]  recreational player, but I loved Letterpress. But is part of the
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.520]  thinking behind something like what games to actually go from
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.720]  prototype to actually let's build this and make it real and ship it.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.720]  Let's do that this year, which is, you know, I'm sure just more work.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.680]  Everything like that is always more work than you could ever imagine.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:57.600]  But is part of it that the idea that with the generator that you guys
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.560]  spent a lot of time building, it's really going to be hard to clone.
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.120]  Nobody's going to be able to clone not words in a good way in a weekend.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.280]  You know, I actually thought that it would be really easy to clone.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.240]  That was my big fear. A lot of the planning for this game was designed
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:19.360]  around the idea that it would be very simple to clone because building
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.280]  puzzles by hand is so easy, right? So if building puzzles by hand is so
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.480]  easy, how hard could it be for the computer? Very hard, turns out.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.720]  But yeah, and the other thing that is very important to understand
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:36.320]  about cloning is a lot of people are not able to intuitively quickly
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.280]  tell the difference between something that's bad and something that's
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.320]  good. And so with not words, somebody could probably clone it, and the
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:46.000]  puzzles could be totally mediocre, and they could still get a ton of
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.680]  traction and get a lot of attention and time, and then because the
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.800]  puzzles are mediocre, people would start to feel like, oh, this actually
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.320]  isn't as good as I thought it was, and burn out on the concept because
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.040]  they experienced the bad version that they didn't even know.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.120]  It's like if somebody decided that they didn't like hamburgers because
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.880]  they'd eaten at Burger King a lot, and it's like, oh, well, that's not
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:10.560]  the good version. But it looks like a hamburger. It's the platonic
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:14.000]  ideal of a hamburger. And so we actually made a ton of design
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.800]  decisions. They're called Burger King, for Christ's sake. Right.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.520]  They have the crown. It's got to be a great burger. We made a lot of
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:27.040]  decisions in the game around that idea. So part of also built into this
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:31.120]  sort of free no ads model is we were like, well, nobody can undercut us,
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.240]  right? Because all these free games, their whole thing is like, yeah,
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.920]  we're going to throw a thousand ads at you, but it's free. And now we're
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.200]  like, no, you know, you can't even do that. Good luck making a game
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.280]  where you have crummy versions of our puzzles and you have no ads and
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.080]  now you want people to pay for it. It's not going to happen. We'll see.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.040]  You know, I hate to issue this challenge. I'm sure someone's going to
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.360]  come and rip us off. But the other part of it was like the game, I've
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.400]  been trying to chase this game design for so long that I know that this
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.640]  game is like, fits into this classic mode. I don't know if it'll, you
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.360]  know, be popular like Sudoku is popular where it's famous all over the
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:12.240]  world, right? That would be amazing. I don't know if that's going to
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.360]  happen, but it fits the model. It's like the same structure as
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:22.240]  something like Sudoku. And so I really wanted to, my biggest goal was
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:25.920]  like, if this game becomes super popular and everybody's done a
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.440]  version of it, I want to make sure that when people look at our version,
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.080]  they know that we were the people who invented it and this was the
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.640]  like beginning of what this game was. And so we made a lot of choices
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.240]  around that structure. Part of it was doing it free. Part of it was
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.520]  just thinking about how we were going to do the polish on the app.
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.320]  Something I noticed, you know, there's a really big game on the app
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:52.480]  store called Wordscapes. That's actually a pretty clever game. And as
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.560]  far as new word games go, I think it's really interesting. But the
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:00.080]  thing with Wordscapes is if you look at Wordscapes and you look at the
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.800]  clones, they look the same. The aesthetic and the design of
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:10.800]  Wordscapes is so bog standard mobile. Everything's flat. There's some
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.000]  stock art in the background. You know, even though this is the game
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.600]  that invented it, it just looks like every other mobile game. And when
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.280]  I first got into it, I didn't even play Wordscapes for a while because
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.080]  I didn't even know that it was the original. I thought, wow, this is
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.520]  just all clones. And we really wanted to make sure that when we built
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:31.280]  the game, it would be so obvious that it was not like these other
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.120]  things, that somebody wouldn't be able to clone our sort of spit and
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.680]  polish. And that's why things like having the bunny be in the game,
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:44.640]  having the different soundscapes, really going for like a Nintendo
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.160]  level of feel and looking at Nintendo games and thinking about how
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:52.480]  does Nintendo do it? What are they interested in? What's their design
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.480]  aesthetic? And how do we work that into what we already know how to do?
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.240]  Yeah, that's what a good way to put it. I'll just add before we move on
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.000]  that that's the one thing I don't like about Wordle because it's a web
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.640]  game. There's no sound. And I like, I like sound. It drives my wife.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.320]  It's going to drive it. When I get divorced, it's going to be, he
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.720]  wouldn't turn off the key clicks on his phone. I like, oh my God, I like
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.040]  the key clicks. I do. I like, because it's the only haptic feedback you
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:26.720]  get on this flat keyboard and I like them and my wife can't stand them
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.680]  and let alone if she's trying to fall asleep or something. So I do, I
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:34.080]  do, of course, mute my phone when she's in bed, but sometimes I forget
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:37.920]  and it's like, it's, I'm telling you, it's going to be the cause of
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.280]  divorce, but I wish Wordle had some sounds. It would be, it would, I
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.920]  don't know. I get it. It's obviously not holding back Wordle's
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.240]  success, but let me take, wait, I had one more thing I wanted to say
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:54.320]  before we move on. I know we're going long, sorry, but this is so
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.240]  fascinating. Oh, for prototyping, what tools do you use?
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:04.560]  Ah, that's a good question. For the most part, we program our games in
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:12.560]  Unity, but we don't tend to start in Unity. I tend to start almost all
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.040]  of my game designs on a piece of paper or with cards or with dice or
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:21.600]  with pieces or banana grams or Scrabble tiles. One of my favorite
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:27.120]  artists is Sol LeWitt and he's a conceptual artist and he makes these
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.480]  beautiful, or he made these beautiful works that were basically
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.440]  instructions and then you would buy a copy of the instructions and
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.840]  people would come to your house from his studio and follow the
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.640]  instructions on a wall and it would create this sort of generative
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.760]  piece of artwork. And Sol LeWitt has this really great piece called
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:52.480]  Sentences on Conceptual Art that is in itself kind of an art piece,
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.840]  even though he specifically says it isn't in the piece. And one of
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.640]  those sentences, one of the ideas of this whole piece is this thought
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.320]  that the conscious brain creates rational stuff and the subconscious
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.800]  brain creates irrational stuff. And irrational stuff is where the
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.680]  gold is, that like the magic of art, the magic of these beautiful
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.920]  things that you experience that you don't know how to understand,
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:22.400]  that that is all born in this subconscious mind. And for me, that's
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.960]  this like really sort of critical text in terms of understanding what
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:31.840]  my process is and how it works. And I have this very strong aversion
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.760]  to thinking too much about something. Like, I think if I have an idea
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.120]  for a game, the most important thing is that I can sit down at the
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:42.960]  table, come up with whatever rules very quickly I need to come up with
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.800]  to be able to test the strange thing that came out of my subconscious.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.000]  Because if I don't do that, if I think about it for too long, it's
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.040]  going to lose all of its magic. I'm going to overdesign it into some
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:56.560]  direction that it's not meant to go and it's just going to be a thing
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.920]  that someone designed. And so for me, because of that, all of the
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:03.040]  tools that I like to work with are tools that require almost no
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.680]  effort, just cards or dice or something. Or if I do program, I don't
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.840]  like to program anything that's going to take more than three hours
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.120]  or four hours to program. It's very important to me that I can like
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:18.560]  get the idea down, play it right away. And I think that's why also
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.520]  a lot of my games are these sort of small ideas that are sort of very
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.360]  deep and have expanded into a lot of different spaces but are like
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.600]  fundamentally just like a very small core.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.440]  PAUL Yeah, that's interesting. I love hearing that. And I was
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:36.960]  wondering how much you design on paper. I do. I know, you know, in
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.560]  the last, I speak of myself as though I still design things. But
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.480]  like when we designed Vesper back in the day, the Notes app, I did so
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:52.640]  much on paper. I just did, you know, and then paper to screenshots
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.760]  to, all right, but now let's make it real. Let's start building this
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:01.120]  because if we dick around too much with just these static things,
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:05.760]  we're going to go way too deep and too far before we know how it
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.400]  feels. And if you don't start making it real at some point, you
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:17.040]  know, and it is true, like an idea in your head, it's sort of like a
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.320]  gas and it's all together for a while. But if you let it just sit as
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:26.400]  an idea for too long, it dissipates too much and it's gone. And you
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.880]  can remember that it was there, but it's no longer maybe more like a
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.120]  liquid. I don't know. It's like liquid and it's like it'll just drip
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  out, you know. It's like you kind of got to freeze it and start making
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.120]  something out of it before it drips out of the leaky bucket that is
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:43.600]  your brain.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.840]  PAUL Yeah, I think it's like, you know, people talk about inspiration,
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.680]  but nobody thinks of inspiration as something that you spent 30 hours
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:56.240]  thinking about. That's design, right? But before the design, you get
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:00.800]  the inspiration. And how much of the inspiration you can stay true
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:05.280]  to, for me, is a real function of how quickly I can work with it
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.320]  before it becomes boring or normal.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.400]  SEAN Are you willing, I don't mean to dig into the, you know, if
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.560]  you're uncomfortable talking about it, that's fine, but maybe you're
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.080]  not. I don't know. But it's like, a couple of days into this, the
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:23.120]  first week of NotWords coming out, what's the split on iOS, Android,
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.680]  and the Steam versions so far?
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.920]  PAUL So I don't know what the Android stuff looks like. I haven't
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:34.080]  asked for those numbers because I don't really care. The Steam stuff,
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.160]  what's the split? Well, that's a very good question. I would say
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:46.000]  probably off the top of my head, I want to say it's like five to one
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.520]  iOS to Steam. But I'm not sure that that's 100% correct. I didn't
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.800]  look at the numbers this morning.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:56.400]  SEAN I say this after telling you, I don't even know my analytics at
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.600]  Daring Fireball. So, you know, ballpark. But it's mostly, I guess
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:03.360]  what I'm getting at, what I'm interested in, is it primarily iOS
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.200]  at this point, because it's new, and that's where, you know, your
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.320]  games are best known. And maybe the people who are most likely to
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:15.440]  appreciate the details that go into it are already on iOS.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:19.520]  PAUL I think that's a big part of it, but I also think it plays
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:24.160]  great on computer, and I was really surprised how enjoyable it is on
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.360]  the computer. But, you know, it's a game design that's for the
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:31.680]  context of mobile. It's gonna be better mobile. Basically, any game
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:35.520]  that is as good mobile as on the computer is better mobile, right?
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:40.480]  Because you have more situations where you can play it, you can,
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:45.040]  you know, open it up in an elevator or whatever. And so I'm not
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:49.440]  surprised that it's doing better on iOS, but also it was kind of meant
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:53.280]  to, I guess. Like, when we thought about bringing it to Steam, we
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.280]  wanted to bring it to Steam for a couple of very tactical reasons. So
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.760]  one of those reasons was we wanted to make sure that it would exist
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.680]  forever in the format we put it out, because it's a Windows game. We
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.480]  never have to touch it again. It'll always be there no matter what.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.760]  Somebody will figure out how to emulate it if they can't. So we've,
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.840]  like, there's an archival aspect to it. The second reason we wanted
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:18.720]  to put it on Steam is because we thought that this is the kind of
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:22.000]  game that would appeal to streamers, because we know there are people
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.080]  who stream crossword games. And Sudokus, right? And Sudokus. If you've
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.440]  got a mobile game, nobody's gonna stream a mobile game on a phone.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.720]  There's tech to do it, but, like, it's just not something people do.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.400]  So we wanted to be able to give streamers a key. And then the third
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.960]  reason, which is one that we didn't even fully realize until we
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:42.720]  released it, but it's hard to get press for games these days. There
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:47.200]  are not that many outlets. And being able to have something be on PC
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:51.200]  means we are opened up to a lot of other outlets that would not
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.440]  normally write about a game, like PC Gamer or CNET, potentially. So
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.560]  that was sort of the third reason. So Steam is like, for us, it was
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.840]  this spot where, oh, and then the last reason is we want to start
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:07.840]  releasing my games on Steam more frequently, and Jack and Mike games
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:11.280]  when we create them on Steam also, just as another platform to
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:15.360]  start putting stuff onto. And this felt like the right game to take
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.400]  that leap with. So really, for us, Steam is serving a bunch of
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:26.080]  sort of utility and experimental services for us. And if we get
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.520]  money also on Steam, that's even better. But that wasn't our main
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.400]  goal. All right. Let me take a break here, thank our third sponsor,
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:35.200]  and then we'll get the home spread. I'm so thankful for your time.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.360]  Sure. This is really fun. I really appreciate it.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.480]  All right. Let me thank our third sponsor. It's our good friends. I
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:43.600]  mean, good friends. I mean, this is our longest running, most common
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.240]  sponsor. I love this company too. Squarespace. Squarespace is where
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:55.040]  you can build your own website without being a web developer or
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:59.760]  knowing anything about web development, but puts you, the person
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:06.320]  who wants to build, create, design, tweak, run, update, check the
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.200]  stats, check the analytics. You want your own website. You don't
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.280]  have the technical ability. You don't know code. You don't know HTML,
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:18.640]  CSS. You don't know JavaScript. Squarespace lets you do it all.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.280]  You don't know DNS. You don't know how to register domain names.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:26.400]  Guess what? You can do it at Squarespace. They do everything,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.560]  literally A to Z of having your own website. Squarespace lets you
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:38.000]  do it without technical expertise. And even with that said, even
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.880]  though everything is visual, everything is drag and drop right in
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.760]  your browser, you still get access to their terrific award-winning
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.640]  technical support. And it's just terrific. So many websites you
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.400]  interact with on a daily basis, like restaurants and places like
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.920]  that, are built on Squarespace. You would never know it. There is
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.560]  no Squarespace look to a website. There's no logo or bug in the
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:06.160]  corner that says this is powered by Squarespace. It's just your
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:11.600]  website with your look, your feel. You start with a score of
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:15.760]  templates to choose from that range all sorts of different styles
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.440]  visually, design-wise. All of their templates scale great from the
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:23.200]  phone to a big desktop, and they're all tweakable and
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.880]  adjustable. You could have stores, and they handle all the stuff
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.440]  like commerce. You can do email campaigns where you can collect
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.880]  email subscribers and convert them into loyal customers and do it
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:38.400]  all with email templates that are just as easy to use as the
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.400]  website templates from Squarespace. They even have SEO
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.880]  tools that are actually healthy and not like weird and gross, but
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.400]  just ways to make sure that your website gets seen by the people
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:53.840]  who ought to be seeing it and help maximize your results in
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.680]  search engines. Because let's face it, that's how people are
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:58.480]  going to come to your website. It's just a great company and a

[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.120]  talk about, before we get, I want to talk about play date, but
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:58.320]  before we get there, the one last thing, and if I, a lot of
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.560]  times when I interview somebody, no matter how long it goes,
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.520]  there's always one thing that it's like, oh my God, that's like
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:06.480]  the first thing I wrote down at the top of my list of questions.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:11.120]  And I forgot, literally at the top of my list here of my notes
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:16.960]  for this conversation with you is about credit. And you open up
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:21.280]  not words, like most of your games. And it says not words game by
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.960]  Zach Gage. And I'm sorry, Jake's last name is Jack Schlesinger.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.080]  Jack Schlesinger. Jack Schlesinger. You know what's funny?
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.480]  So I misremembered Jack as Jake, but I was actually going to guess
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:41.120]  Schlesinger. But you don't see that a lot. And I've, I actually,
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:44.320]  like 10, 15 years ago gave a talk. I mean, actually, I guess it
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:48.080]  was 15, at least 15 years ago, because it was a Mac world expo.
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:52.240]  But I even gave a talk where it was like my top 10 issues with
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.640]  Apple at the time. And one of them was the fact that at old
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:01.920]  Apple, let's say classic Mac era Apple, the about boxes for Apple
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:04.400]  software had the names of the people at Apple who made the
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.720]  thing. And at some point, and it was definitely a Steve Jobs
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.400]  thing when they came back, and they stopped that. And policy
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.360]  wise, soup to nuts, all throughout Mac OS X, there's
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.720]  nowhere where you can go and say about text edit or about
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:23.520]  mail or about any of the apps. And you don't get credits. And
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.280]  the idea, you know, Jobs' notion ostensibly was that he
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:32.560]  thought that Apple's rivals were using about boxes to recruit
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:37.600]  Apple people. Well, I, you know, he was, he was, he was
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.560]  obsessed with, what do you call, not recruiting, but what's it
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:46.400]  called when you, poaching, right? Which is very much, I'm
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:48.800]  not like an anti-capitalist, but it's definitely the
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.560]  perspective of the CEO of a company. Whereas from the
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:56.400]  ground up, it's called taking a better job, right? Which is
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:01.040]  actually something people do and should be able to do. And,
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.440]  you know, it's, that's how you build a career. And if you want
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.480]  to keep these people, hiding their names isn't the way to do
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:09.840]  it. It's keep them happy and pay them fairly and well. And I
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:12.400]  so I don't think that was quite it. I think it was also just
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.840]  sort of an irrational part of the Apple brand. You know, they
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:18.800]  just want everything to be from Apple. It's Apple. They want
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:22.160]  Apple's name to be on the credits. And you see that, you
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:25.200]  just, but even outside Apple, you see it, you know, there just
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:27.920]  aren't a lot of games that open like that. But other forms of
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.200]  artwork, you know, certainly books, you buy a book, there's
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.160]  the author's name is on the cover. You watch a movie or a TV
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.960]  show, they always start with opening credits and they tell
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.880]  you who the stars of the show are and the producers, you know,
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.160]  but then you get it. And the last opening credits are the
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:51.040]  writer and the director. And because writing and directing
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:55.760]  are the the most creative, the most responsible for the thing
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.080]  that you're watching. And they always get credit. And you know,
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:02.880]  I know in the entertainment industry, it's it's, you know,
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:05.600]  it's actually written into the the union rules, you know, for
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.240]  the Writers Guild and the Directors Guild, but it's just
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.760]  it's just part of it. And you know, you come from the world of
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.680]  real art, you know, real physical art, you know, that's,
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.240]  you know, I don't mean to hang on your wall art, right? Hang on
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:24.000]  your wall art. It would be absurd if you went to a show and
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.200]  they didn't put the name of the artists on or like a museum,
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:29.760]  like imagine going to a museum and they don't tell you who
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.280]  painted this. It would be absurd. But that's sort of how
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.120]  the the computer world is gone. Like, you just go to a lot of
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.680]  websites and you never see the names of the people who made
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:45.360]  it. Yeah. Oh, man. I don't want to talk for a whole another
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:48.240]  hour about this. I have so many feelings about this. I think
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:51.440]  one thing to bring up is that this this has been a very
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:55.840]  contentious topic sort of behind the scenes in the game
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.880]  industry for a really long time. Not just right now with
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:02.160]  the way that credits are given, but historically, you know,
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.640]  games were companies. And then for a minute when EA showed up
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.720]  it was all about the people who made the games and then very
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:14.000]  quickly it suddenly became the companies wanted to be the
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.960]  companies again and they hid those names and it and it was
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.400]  similar to sort of the jobs and stuff that you're describing.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.320]  Companies wanted to have the credit and own the games and
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:29.120]  and sort of take over. And I think when indies started to
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.720]  really blow up, at least around the time that I showed up, a lot
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.440]  of people, you know, you're just one person and you're
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.840]  just one person and you're making a game in the space and
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.320]  you're trying to figure out how to make money. And your first
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.360]  thought is, you know, I need to look like the other players in
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.280]  this space. I should have a company because if I have a cute
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.400]  logo and a good and a good company name, that's how people,
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.160]  you know, that's what I'm supposed to do that makes me
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.360]  look professional. And I think to some extent, actually,
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.520]  despite coming from art and being used to signing the things
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.760]  that I do with my literal name, I think I kind of fell into
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.440]  this name first approach because when I signed up with
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:10.320]  Apple, I didn't have a company and you could sign up just as
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.240]  yourself. And so always it was my games were from Zach Gage.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:18.000]  That's where they're from. And it I think it took me a little
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.560]  bit into my career to sort of start to really look at this
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:25.440]  and say, no, this is this is the right approach. This is
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:27.840]  something that I'm not this is not just a default. I'm going
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.880]  to figure out how to embrace this. And one of the reasons
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.440]  that I thought that that was really important is I am, for
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:38.960]  me, one of the big things besides the critical thinking
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:41.680]  thing is this game literacy thing and getting people to
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:46.320]  understand games and and to be able to understand the game
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.720]  industry as an artistic industry. And when I look at
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.920]  something like film and I look at film directors and think
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.480]  about, well, what is it that got film directors to be able to
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:04.400]  be looked at as artistic? And I think it's that, you know, the
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.000]  age in film where you go, oh, this is a Hitchcock movie or
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.040]  this is a Spielberg movie, right? It's that that moment
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.320]  where you can watch three Spielberg movies and three
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.480]  Hitchcock movies. And even though they're all about
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.960]  different things, you can see that cohesiveness between those
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.400]  movies because there's a person at the top that you know,
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.560]  whereas like if you watch three MGM movies, right, that
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.200]  doesn't give you anything. And then once you know a name, you
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.360]  can go, oh, when I grow up, I want to be Steven Spielberg. I
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:40.560]  want to do the thing that Michael Crichton does and write
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:43.840]  books. I want, you know, you have to be able to see the
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:48.720]  human behind the art for you to be able to see the art
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:53.680]  sometimes. And I think that's really important for games, not
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:57.120]  just from the artistic standpoint, but also even from
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:00.480]  the standpoint of getting more people into games and not as
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:03.360]  making games through the game industry, but as being indie,
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:05.920]  as being able to look at games and say, oh, I could make a
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.560]  game. I could be a part of this. And so those are a huge
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:13.680]  number of the things that I think about when I'm looking at
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.880]  this approach of like really putting these names up front.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.160]  That's so well said. And it's so, you know, it's so
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:24.160]  interesting with directors. I'm fascinated by it. And that was
[02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:27.840]  my credit on Vesper. I was credited as the director because
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.480]  that's how I saw my role. Brent Simmons was writing the code.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:34.720]  Dave Whiskus was doing all the actual design and I was just in
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:37.440]  the middle directing it and saying, yes, this is how it
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:39.920]  should feel. This is how it should work. And, you know, it
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:42.480]  wasn't, I wasn't trying to be cute. I just didn't know how
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:45.120]  else to describe it, but it worked out well, even though
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.240]  the app was not a financial success, it worked out well as
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:52.320]  a way of working and conceptualizing what my role was.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:56.160]  And it's funny because you can have directors whose work is
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:00.640]  so idiosyncratically distinctive. Wes Anderson pops
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:04.640]  into mind, right? Like it would be very, very difficult.
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:07.680]  You know, I'm sure he's also, he's so talented. If he wanted
[02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:10.320]  to make a movie that didn't look and feel like a Wes
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.360]  Anderson movie as we know it, I'm sure he could, but it's
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:19.200]  like, what he wants to make is so clearly of his style, you
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:23.600]  know, and somebody else who I'm a huge fan of, Sofia Coppola,
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:28.320]  is more of a chameleon. And I don't think if you showed me a
[02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:32.240]  new Sofia Coppola movie, but there weren't credits, I don't
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:35.840]  know that I would be able to guess that it was her until
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:38.800]  maybe I got to the end of the movie and, and the, it's the
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:42.240]  themes and, and little things. And it's like, maybe I would
[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:45.600]  have her on the list, but, but it's a deliberate choice on her
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:51.840]  part to sort of bend her style to the structure of the thing.
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:55.040]  But it's, once you know the themes that she keeps coming
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.640]  back to, it's very distinctive. And I think so important. And I
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:01.680]  just love that. I don't know. You could make anything,
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:05.280]  honestly, paint drawing on a wall, a game by Zach Gage, and
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:06.800]  I'm going to download it and try it.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:12.720]  I'm glad you're enjoying them all. I always go back to paint
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:16.800]  drawing on a wall because when, when in the late 90s, when the
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:19.200]  word came out that Stanley Kubrick had finally had a new
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.840]  movie coming out, Eyes Wide Shut, my one friend who was also
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.960]  a big Kubrick fan said, if Stanley Kubrick made a movie of
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.240]  paint drawing on a wall, I'd watch it at least once. Just
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.080]  because I trust him so much that somehow he'll make it engaging.
[02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:34.880]  Right. You can already start to think in your mind, like what
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:37.680]  could be happening? Like that would make this great.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.400]  Yeah. What would it sound like? What kind of creepy music?
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:43.280]  Are there shadows going by that mean things?
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:45.920]  Hitchcock's another one. I just, I just watched, it's one of
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.800]  those YouTube rabbit holes, you know, you start going down the
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.520]  YouTube rabbit hole of anything and it's like, oh my God,
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.480]  YouTube is so amazing. But it was like a couple, I got into a
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:58.720]  couple of Hitchcock YouTube videos. Cause I linked to, I
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:02.160]  forget what the context was, Rope. It was something with
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:05.360]  Glenn Fleischman about doing something in a single take. And
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:10.880]  Rope is a Hitchcock movie that it simulates 90 minutes of a
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:14.080]  continuous take of a murder mystery, but they could only
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:17.120]  shoot just under 10 minutes of film at a time in a film
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:20.720]  canister. And so he disguises all the cuts by like panning
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:23.600]  the camera across somebody's back. So there's a moment where
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:27.520]  all you see is the black of somebody's suit jacket. And then
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:31.600]  when you get to the end of the pan, it's actually a new cut of
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:35.200]  film. It's ingenious editing, but it's actually a very good
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.680]  movie. I would recommend it. It's also, I was like, when the
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.160]  hell did he make that? Cause I remember I haven't seen it in
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:42.960]  forever. And now it's like near the top of my to watch list
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:45.840]  again. Cause I haven't seen it in like 25 years, but it's in
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:50.560]  color, but it's a 1946 movie, which is to me like breaking my
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:53.040]  mind. I was like, I didn't, I didn't think they had color
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.240]  movies. And then I'm like, oh no, The Wizard of Oz and Snow
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.920]  White was 1937. So that was animation, but somehow I didn't
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:03.360]  think they shot movies. But anyway, it, if you ever, if
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.920]  somebody ever found a lost Hitchcock movie and there were
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.400]  no credits, the whole movie was edited together, but there were
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:13.680]  no credits and you watched it. You'd say, oh, this is a, what
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:16.080]  the hell is, this is a, this is an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:19.280]  There'd be no, there's no mistaking it. Nobody else could
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.560]  make it. I mean, like Brian De Palma is sort of, is, you know,
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.240]  admittedly a huge, huge Hitchcock fan and makes Hitchcock
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.640]  style plots, but they don't look like a Hitchcock movie.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:34.480]  They look like a Brian De Palma movie. It's, it's so, it's so
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:36.560]  interesting to me. And I just love that you put your name on
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.400]  it. The last topic I want to talk about, and it's the rare
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:43.680]  instance where I've got, I can parlay off the previous episode
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:47.760]  of the show is talking about Panic's play date, which you, I
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:49.360]  guess, have some experience with.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:53.760]  Yeah, well, it's funny. Mine, I literally, it arrived right
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:58.560]  before we did this call. I was like, oh no, I, I gotta go run
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.920]  downstairs and pick this up. But also, yeah, I made one of
[02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:04.480]  the games in the first season, so I've had one for a very long
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:06.720]  time. It's cool.
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:09.840]  I know, I know that the way they're unfurling the season,
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.000]  that the games are sort of a surprise. So I don't want, I'm
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.560]  not pressing for any spoilers. I never, ever press my guess
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:19.040]  for that. But so if it's, if the game itself is a secret, I
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.720]  don't even know. Cause my play date is still lower on the,
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:25.840]  it's coming soon, but not, I wasn't quick enough to do the
[02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:27.920]  pre-order. I'd say, you know, if you don't want to tell me
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.560]  what it is, you don't have to tell me, or is it known what
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.680]  the game is or?
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.880]  Yeah, it's a little known. I haven't, there's been like a
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:38.400]  little bit of previews around it, but I'm very curious how
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:40.800]  people will take it. It's a game that I designed a very long
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.400]  time ago cause I got in working with it almost right at the
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.920]  start. But it's, it's a take on Snake because I wanted to do
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.200]  something with buttons. So it's a Snake game, like the Nokia
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.400]  Snake game, but you can jump and you can jump onto yourself
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.040]  and ride on yourself and jump over yourself. And so it kind
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.880]  of turned Snake a little bit into maybe a little bit like a
[02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:04.080]  skateboarding game, but I just wanted to make something that
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:08.400]  was very simple and would fit the device and would be the
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.720]  kind of game that, that reminded me of the kinds of games
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:15.920]  that made me excited about the device, which is really the
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:18.880]  thing that, that is like the, the first thing that I really
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:22.560]  thought about when they started pitching this thing is, I
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.520]  remember in high school making games and it was cool making
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.840]  games and showing them to friends on the computer. But the
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.480]  thing that like really took off amongst my friends was, do you
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:36.880]  remember the TI-83 graphing calculator? Yes, definitely.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.840]  So that was like this wild graphing calculator that you
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:43.200]  could use to plot things, but you could also make games for
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.640]  it. It had this like very chromey programming language.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:52.160]  But it also, it was, it was a LED black and white screen, but
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:57.440]  it was bit mapped instead of, you know, those, those 888,
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:01.280]  where, you know, the best game you could make on like an even
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:04.560]  older calculator was spelling the word, you know, boobies
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:08.400]  upside down or something like that. Right, this had a real
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:11.120]  screen though. And so like people did all kinds of weird
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:14.240]  stuff. Like somebody ported like Legends of Zelda Game Boy
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:17.600]  game to it, which seems like impossible to imagine. But like
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.680]  also it was very easy to make dumb little games for friends
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.360]  and give them to them and let them play them on a physical
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:30.000]  piece of hardware. And that was just this totally magical thing
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.200]  in high school. And I remember playing Snake a lot on it. And
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:37.120]  so I wanted to kind of explore that a little bit and do a
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.680]  little homage. But the thing that I wanted to talk about the
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:42.000]  play date, I remember you, so on your last show, you were
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.920]  talking about how exciting it is that Panic is making these
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.240]  tools for this thing. And Panic is like one of the best tool
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:53.920]  making companies that's out there. And that is like exactly
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.520]  what I'm excited about more than the thing is this potential
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:00.960]  for a community. And I wanted to just talk a little bit about,
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:05.360]  are you familiar with Pico 8 at all? I've heard of it. Okay.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.560]  You tell me what it is. I know. So Pico 8, so first of all,
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:14.960]  there's like a huge space of indie game design tools that
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.680]  are very simple, some of which are even like directly
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:20.640]  referenced. Like Pulp is directly inspired by something
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.720]  called Bitsy. And there's Bitsy, there's Twine, there's something
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.480]  called PuzzleScript. And all of these very successful little
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.400]  tools have these niche communities. And I think one of
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.000]  the things that makes these tools very approachable and fun
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.440]  for people to work with is that there are these incredible
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:42.080]  constraints around what you can create. So like if you make
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:45.440]  something in Twine, it's going to be a website, it's got to be
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:47.760]  basically text, even though you can have pictures, you're going
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:50.240]  to click hyperlinks to move through it. If you're making
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.840]  something in Bitsy, you have a very limited amount of space for
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.400]  your aesthetic, you really can only use the arrow keys to move
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.520]  around. There's like all of these constraints. And a couple
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.560]  of years ago, this person Zep came up with this thing called
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.560]  Pico 8, and they called it a fantasy console, which is this
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.080]  incredible idea, which is basically it's like he invented
[02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.440]  this console that doesn't exist, but it has all the constraints
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:19.360]  of like a real old console. So when you program, your program
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:22.560]  length is like specifically limited. You can only have so
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:27.600]  many characters. You can only use certain kinds of sound
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:31.600]  stuff. You can only have so many pieces of art. You can only
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.840]  have so many colors. And all of these constraints work together
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:38.880]  in this very cool way because they create this very
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:43.360]  constrained tool, but it's not constrained to a kind of game.
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.160]  It's constrained in other ways. And what that did is it created
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.320]  this amazing community. And so like Pico 8 has like a BBS
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.080]  system where you can post games, they can be shown in just
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.800]  an image and it downloads into the software and you can play
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.080]  it. Like of all the spaces in indie games that I'm excited
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:05.440]  about for like young people to be creating interesting stuff,
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.040]  Pico 8 is by far the most exciting. There's people doing
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:11.440]  weird experiments. There's people learning to program.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.960]  There are famous indies creating prototypes in that space
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:17.840]  that then go on to be turned into bigger games that are
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:20.560]  making, you know, tens of millions of dollars. It's this
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:25.040]  incredibly amazing, thrilling space. And the thing that is
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:28.320]  weird about it is after Zep created this fantasy console, a
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.760]  lot of people have gone and said like, okay, well, we're going
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:33.680]  to make a fantasy console and it's going to have these
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.760]  different rules. And none of them have ever taken off in any
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:43.680]  way really at all to rival Pico 8. And I feel like the play
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:46.880]  date is the first thing I'm seeing that isn't just a
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:50.560]  derivative of this idea of a fantasy console, but is an
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.640]  evolution of this idea of a fantasy console in that it's got
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.000]  all of the tools and all of the smarts and all of the care
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.120]  that goes into creating the tool chain for this because it's
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:04.880]  panic. But it's also not a fantasy console. It's a real
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:08.640]  console. And that's so amazing to me that they were able to
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.120]  pull that off. And I feel like there's this incredible chance
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:17.840]  to have not just one great video game, indie game, artistic
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:23.360]  exploration community, but two. And one of them be focused on
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.960]  this beautiful little yellow thing. And that's, that's the
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:29.760]  thing that I'm so excited about is like, it's not just the
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:33.280]  tools. It's that there's this holistic thing happening that
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:38.240]  is giving us an opportunity for a community, a new community in
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:42.800]  a way that is very uncommon. It's that whole everything is a
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:47.280]  remix, a mentality, or going from improv comedy where you
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.200]  just start with an idea and this. And it's like, what if you
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.640]  took the Pico 8 fantasy console and instead of like just
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.560]  tweaking limits, what if we said instead of 48 kilobyte
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:02.160]  limited, we'll make it 64. What if like the, and is, and will
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.920]  actually make a little handheld thing, like an actual thing and
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:11.600]  we'll sell it for like $179. And then immediately somebody
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:16.480]  says, of course. Well, that sounds like a nightmare. Right.
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.040]  And they're like, yeah, but maybe we could. And then they
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:22.000]  look, wouldn't it be fun? And you know, that's sort of, you
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  know, the backstory, you know, it was, and it took panic
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.640]  longer than I think they thought it would, but not too
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:31.680]  much longer. It's shipping. You know, I think they announced
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:34.960]  earlier than they probably wish they had because they had an
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:37.840]  opportunity to be featured in a, I forget the magazine, but
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:43.200]  it's a real edge. Right. And, and I don't even know if they
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.920]  regret it. I think it's a, you know, why not, if you can get
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.560]  that opportunity, but it makes Playdate seem later than I
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.800]  think it's fairly, would fairly be deemed to consider that it
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:59.120]  is because it was announced then, you know. I think if you
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:03.120]  look at it like as the, as the process though, I think what
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:09.360]  you end up seeing is this, there's some people really know
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:12.480]  how to do a process. Like the people who are the best at
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:15.040]  stuff, it's not that they're coming up with an amazing idea.
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.560]  It's that once they have an idea, they know how to chase it
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:21.360]  down and build it into something that's really amazing.
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.160]  And if you look at what the Playdate was, like when I got
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.800]  into the Playdate, they basically were explained to me,
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:29.120]  you know, we're going to try to have 52 games and we're going
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  to put this thing out and, and every week of the year, you're
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.320]  going to get a new game and it'll be some very small
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.800]  experience and we're just going to contract a bunch and, and
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:40.880]  it'll be a big surprise to everybody and that'll be the
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:47.120]  thing. Right. And then I think the longer it took them to do
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:51.840]  the hardware, it sort of put the screws to them on the software
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:54.880]  side and on thinking about it. It's like, you know, if, if
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:56.960]  you've got a couple of people working on hardware and they're
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:00.560]  working on it for almost eight years, you've still got other
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.200]  people on the project. Right. Who have to figure out what
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.280]  they're doing and what they're paying attention to. And I
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:08.320]  think the very first thing they realized was, wow, a lot more
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:11.040]  developers want to get involved in this than we thought. Like
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.400]  we actually can't find all the cool developers. So we need to
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:17.680]  hire someone who can like do developer outreach and start to
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:20.320]  find out more developers and start to find out what kinds of
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:24.160]  things developers need. And so they got it to more people and
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:27.280]  then they started to realize like, oh, well, you know,
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:30.800]  they're even more people. It's not just this audience of, of
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.200]  people who can code, who make good games that we want to
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.360]  reach out to. Like what if we could reach out to everybody?
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:38.000]  What if we could have a tool where we're in this space now
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.160]  and we're seeing all of this stuff? Maybe there's stuff we
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:42.640]  could make that would make it available to everybody that
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:45.520]  anybody could code a thing for this. And I don't think you
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:48.400]  would necessarily see that if they had shipped the Playdate
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:53.120]  three years ago. I think a lot of this stuff developed as the
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:56.640]  excitement around the product got bigger and they had to start
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.400]  to think about like, well, what are, what is this opened up?
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:03.840]  What kind of doors can we find now where we can build stuff
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:07.520]  for this? Yeah. And you know, it was the previous episode with
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.000]  Michael Simmons where we talked about Playdate at the end. And
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.640]  one of the analogies, you know, we mentioned the Pulp system,
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:16.720]  which is the web-based thing that is very visual and, and
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:19.760]  therefore, because it's visual and it's in the web and, and you
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:22.240]  don't have to conceptualize the game as source code in your
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:25.360]  head, you can visualize it, conceptualize it, turn it from
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:28.640]  idea to, to a game you can actually install on a Playdate
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:33.120]  and play. It's so accessible to more people because that's how
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:36.000]  different people speak. And the analogy I didn't, I wanted to
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.240]  make, but didn't make last week was to PostScript, which people
[02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:44.560]  forget, but, or don't know, but Adobe PostScript is a
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:48.400]  programming language and you could write it by hand. I had a
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:53.920]  professor at Drexel who did his PhD thesis on PostScript and he
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:57.360]  showed us his demos and they were amazing. And the source
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.760]  code, it's not the easiest programming language to use for
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:02.880]  sure. It's not like writing assembly language, but like with
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:06.880]  just a ridiculously short number of lines of code, he'd make
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.920]  these unbelievable vector images. And then you could, you
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:13.200]  know, the, the displays at the time were incapable of proving
[02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:16.320]  that they were vector, but you could just keep zooming in to
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.960]  show that, oh, that's a vector because you just keep zooming
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:22.560]  and zooming and it just is more intricate. But it's clearly
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:27.760]  Illustrator that made PostScript something for the most people
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:30.720]  and people who are artists because you just drag a line,
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:33.040]  you make a curve. How do you adjust the curve? You drag a
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:36.640]  handle and, and you do it visually, right? And it's like
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:39.680]  pulp could be that sort of thing for, for budding game
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:43.280]  developers, or even if it's just game designers, you know,
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:46.080]  like we talked about prototyping before and maybe to
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.760]  really take an idea and see it to completion. Maybe you'd have
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:53.840]  to graduate from pulp to their fuller SDK in Lua or C or
[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:56.720]  something like that. But you can get something as, you know,
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.400]  that's an actual game, not just like a bunch of index cards,
[02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:04.720]  not, you know, and again, I'm a paper person, but proving that
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:08.880]  a game is a good idea is actually having it on a play date
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:12.720]  and pushing buttons and making things happen and having fun
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:15.040]  is different than flipping through a bunch of index cards
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:16.720]  where you show what the screens would look like.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:20.960]  I think if the play date becomes very successful, we're
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.240]  going to see a lot of incredible games that are done entirely
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:27.840]  in pulp. I think one of the things that is very easy to
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:31.840]  forget about with games is that, you know, like a game
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:35.760]  doesn't frequently require the bleeding edge of technology
[02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:39.600]  sometimes, sure, but most of the time, I mean, you can make a
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.240]  game with a pencil and a tablecloth at a restaurant and
[02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:47.840]  play it. You don't need anything. And I think really
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:51.680]  often the thing that new game designers need or students of
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:54.400]  game design need is constraints. That's the thing that
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:57.280]  you actually need to make a game because otherwise it's
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:00.240]  very difficult to focus and move in a direction. And so I
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:03.840]  think these tools that give us interesting, compelling
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:08.160]  constraints and then also a really meaningful payoff are
[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:11.120]  always the most powerful tools. And that's why Pico 8 was
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:14.880]  really successful. And I hope that'll be the case with the
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:15.280]  play date.
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:19.280]  I personally also, and again, it's nostalgia because I came
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:23.120]  of age in the 80s with the black and white monochrome
[02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:27.360]  Mac, but I love the aesthetic of just black and white. And
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:32.080]  I love the Atkinson dithering algorithm to do things that
[02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:35.440]  you just can't believe aren't grayscale, but are really just
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:39.040]  black and white pixels and you use the right algorithm and
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.240]  you can do this. But the funny thing is that as limited as the
[02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:46.400]  play date is, it is so much more powerful than like a 1984
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:49.840]  Macintosh. So you can do things in black and white on the
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:53.760]  play date screen that you never, ever, ever, even Bill Atkinson
[02:23:53.760 --> 02:23:56.720]  himself could never have done, like animate something that's
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:59.760]  using this complicated algorithm for the dithering effect
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:04.160]  and have it just be completely live at a reasonable frames
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:04.640]  per second.
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.880]  Yeah, I think that's one of the most delightful things about
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:14.240]  the devices. I think people will play some of these games
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:18.480]  and just be absolutely in awe about what this looks like.
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:20.880]  You think a black and white screen looks one way and then
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:25.360]  you play this thing that is just like animated in an
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:28.880]  incredible way. But then at the same time, if you're trying
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:33.440]  to make a game for this, you know, the ask couldn't be lower.
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.320]  You know, you got to make a little character in black and
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:39.920]  white. Sure, anyone can do that. It's great.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:45.120]  Right, and it brings me back to like those early days decades
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.600]  ago on the classic Mac where you could open up anything in
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:49.440]  ResEdit and just...
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:50.480]  I miss ResEdit so much.
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.680]  Right? I know you do because I know that you did the same
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.960]  thing as if like an icon really bugged you or you just wanted
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:00.160]  to just have fun. You could just open it up in ResEdit, open
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:03.680]  the icon, and you had a little pixel editor that was really
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:07.440]  well done and had, you know, like a pencil tool and a fill
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:10.640]  tool and a race tool and you had undo and you could just
[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:14.240]  make a little thing and you'd see the zoomed up version next
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:17.040]  to the shrunk down version so you could see if the little
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:20.720]  tricks you were using to draw the pixel by pixel art actually
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:23.760]  looked good at real size and then make your own little icons
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:27.280]  and, you know, hit save and then all of a sudden, you know,
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:29.920]  the button for whatever, you know, the icon for whatever
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:32.480]  looked the way you designed it and not the way that it shipped
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:33.440]  on however you got it.
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:36.240]  I mean, this isn't even what we're talking about, but I'm
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:40.560]  just so excited to talk about ResEdit for a second. On top
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.320]  of that, you could like add little menu items that
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:47.920]  frequently you could never hook up into doing anything or
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:50.480]  like you could go look at the assembly. I mean, the thing
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:54.000]  that was amazing about ResEdit is it really was the view
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.040]  source of the Mac and even though the source you viewed was
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:02.480]  like basically impassable because it was compiled down to
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.800]  assembly, it was incredible. It was like amazing as a kid
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:11.040]  to have this tool that let me look inside anything and have
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:14.080]  it basically be like, yeah, this is a thing. Someone made
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.080]  it. This is what it looks like inside.
[02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:19.120]  Yeah, and you could see this is and this is what it looked
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.280]  like to the creator, right? Like you're just the user. You
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:26.400]  got this copy of the app and you've cracked it open and in
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:30.160]  ResEdit, you know, just open it and you're looking at these
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:33.440]  resources in the exact same way that the developer and
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:36.160]  designers who made the app were looking at it and making
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:36.880]  it and tweaking it.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:39.280]  Yeah, and then you could tweak it.
[02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:42.320]  Yeah, exactly. It was such a great way to get you to feel
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:44.080]  like, hey, I could do this too.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:45.440]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:49.440]  Ah, well, Zach, this was absolutely a wonderful, wonderful
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.840]  discussion. I'm so happy to have you on the show. I'll have
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:55.280]  you back because this is too good and I have questions left,
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:57.120]  so, you know, I'll save them for the next time.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:00.480]  Great. I'd love to come back. I love being on this. This was
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:01.760]  a really fun conversation.
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.720]  It feels like a reasonable guess given the last 15 years of
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:10.000]  your career that you'll probably have future games.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:17.840]  Yes. I will say this, if I can ask one bonus question, it's
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:20.800]  how much, when you set out, did you set out to be somebody
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:24.480]  who makes a lot of little games as opposed to, you know,
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:27.760]  your life's work is this one masterpiece game?
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:32.720]  I don't think I set out to do anything. I'm someone who
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:36.400]  operates very in the moment and I always just want to do the
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:40.560]  thing that I'm excited about and then get it out because
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:43.440]  I'm afraid that if I don't get it out, it'll never show up.
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:45.840]  And all I want to do is have the thing be out and be able
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:49.920]  to talk about it. So I don't know that I set out to do
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:52.480]  anything, but I've always been the kind of person who makes
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:55.120]  a lot of small stuff. So that was, I think, going to be
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.620]  how it went.
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:58.480]  All right. That's a perfect way to end the show. But I want
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:01.360]  to thank, in addition to Zach Gage and his wonderful new
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.440]  game, Not Words, which you can find on the App Store and on
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:08.480]  Steam and on the Play Store, I'm going to thank our sponsors.
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.800]  We had Squarespace, where you can build your own website,
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.680]  and Memberful, where you can monetize your passion with
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:17.840]  membership and collide endpoint security for teams at Slack.
[02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:18.400]  Thank you, Zach.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:36.160]  Thank you.
