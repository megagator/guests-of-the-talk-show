[00:00.000 --> 00:02.660]  So I don't even know where to start.
[00:02.660 --> 00:03.540]  Have you seen this?
[00:03.540 --> 00:04.900]  It's just BitMe today.
[00:04.900 --> 00:09.660]  So we're recording Sunday, September 4th.
[00:09.660 --> 00:12.580]  The show will probably be out tomorrow.
[00:12.580 --> 00:15.300]  And then Wednesday, what's that, three days from now,
[00:15.300 --> 00:16.300]  is Apple's event.
[00:16.300 --> 00:18.620]  So we're doing a pre-Apple event that's
[00:18.620 --> 00:21.240]  round up everything before we head to the airport
[00:21.240 --> 00:25.820]  and meet each other in San Francisco show.
[00:25.820 --> 00:28.080]  On the weekends, more and more, I
[00:28.080 --> 00:30.960]  spend almost all my time on the iPhone,
[00:30.960 --> 00:32.900]  either iPhone or iPhone and iPad.
[00:32.900 --> 00:34.900]  Try to stay out of my office, stay off the Mac,
[00:34.900 --> 00:37.880]  don't really do work, and just sort of read on the phone.
[00:37.880 --> 00:39.260]  And I ran into this today.
[00:39.260 --> 00:40.640]  And it's one of these things I've
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.920]  heard other people talk about it.
[00:42.920 --> 00:44.360]  I think it's happened to me before,
[00:44.360 --> 00:46.800]  but I've never really paid too much attention.
[00:46.800 --> 00:48.480]  And it happened all of a sudden.
[00:48.480 --> 00:51.100]  But I was just browsing on Twitter, opened a link,
[00:51.100 --> 00:53.280]  and the screen went black on my phone.
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.840]  And then I held down the power button,
[00:55.840 --> 00:59.160]  and it said it gave me the signal to plug it into power,
[00:59.160 --> 01:01.240]  like as though the battery had run out.
[01:01.240 --> 01:05.840]  But I'm convinced I had more than 50% battery life left.
[01:05.840 --> 01:07.300]  And so I plugged it in.
[01:07.300 --> 01:10.040]  I just waited, seriously, like a minute.
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.480]  And the phone came back on.
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.680]  The Apple logo came on.
[01:12.680 --> 01:17.280]  And it had, I don't know, 60% battery.
[01:17.280 --> 01:18.720]  Have you ever seen this?
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.600]  I have heard about it.
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.480]  It has never happened to me.
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.780]  It's happened to me with the Apple watch,
[01:21.780 --> 01:24.160]  where all of a sudden it'll go da-da-da-da-da,
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.480]  no power left, shut down.
[01:25.480 --> 01:26.840]  And then I plug it back in.
[01:26.840 --> 01:29.560]  And I always assumed the radios didn't have a good connection.
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.200]  And it was just gobbling down power.
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.660]  But I've had a lot of re-springs,
[01:33.660 --> 01:34.820]  or sorry, springboard crashes.
[01:34.820 --> 01:37.040]  But I've never had the full shut down Monte.
[01:37.040 --> 01:39.680]  Right, and combined with the confusion
[01:39.680 --> 01:42.600]  that the device thinks it's low on battery, right?
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.920]  I could even see if the whole OS crashed,
[01:44.920 --> 01:46.520]  that there's some kind of software thing
[01:46.520 --> 01:47.800]  that could shut the phone down.
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.960]  But then when it powers back up when it's off,
[01:49.960 --> 01:51.460]  I don't understand why it suddenly
[01:51.460 --> 01:52.540]  thinks it has no battery.
[01:52.540 --> 01:53.960]  And I've Googled it a little bit.
[01:53.960 --> 01:56.680]  And it sounds bad.
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.840]  It sounds like if I go into the Apple store,
[01:58.840 --> 02:00.880]  that they're going to take my iPhone and give me a new one.
[02:00.880 --> 02:02.960]  But I don't want to do that before I travel.
[02:02.960 --> 02:03.800]  No, absolutely.
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.080]  And from what I saw, too, because I looked around as
[02:06.080 --> 02:08.720]  well, it seems like it misunderstands its state.
[02:08.720 --> 02:10.240]  And then it goes into that panic shut
[02:10.240 --> 02:13.120]  down to conserve the last bit of battery you have left mode.
[02:13.120 --> 02:15.280]  And then once it gets power back, it's like, oh, no, OK.
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.080]  Everything's fine.
[02:16.080 --> 02:16.920]  I got 50%.
[02:16.920 --> 02:17.420]  We're good.
[02:17.420 --> 02:17.920]  We're good.
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.040]  Sorry, bad.
[02:19.040 --> 02:21.520]  Right, it seems like a bad problem.
[02:21.520 --> 02:25.120]  And maybe after I get back home next week,
[02:25.120 --> 02:28.320]  maybe I'll go ahead and do it.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.840]  But before I go to San Francisco,
[02:29.840 --> 02:32.800]  there's absolutely no way I'm swapping this phone out.
[02:32.800 --> 02:33.480]  You never know.
[02:37.760 --> 02:38.560]  It is funny, too.
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.200]  It makes me laugh that my year-old iPhone 6S is
[02:42.200 --> 02:44.560]  starting to act up literally.
[02:44.560 --> 02:45.160]  It's pissed.
[02:45.160 --> 02:45.680]  It's upset.
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.000]  It knows you're about to replace it.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.420]  It knows you're going to take it with you to replace it.
[02:49.420 --> 02:51.120]  Right.
[02:51.120 --> 02:51.720]  Right.
[02:51.720 --> 02:59.560]  It's like the indignity of it, of taking it with me to your
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.300]  meet and replace.
[03:00.300 --> 03:02.000]  I forgot I said it last year, but one of our friends
[03:02.000 --> 03:03.880]  tweeted that I'm watching my iPhone get
[03:03.880 --> 03:06.040]  replaced on the iPhone that's going to be replaced.
[03:06.040 --> 03:08.920]  Right.
[03:08.920 --> 03:15.880]  So among the things that have leaked in the last week or so
[03:15.880 --> 03:20.760]  is I'll start with, oh, I don't even
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.680]  know where to start.
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.040]  How about we start with these boxes that have leaked,
[03:24.040 --> 03:25.040]  the packaging?
[03:25.040 --> 03:27.480]  And for some reason, the ones that have leaked, a lot of them
[03:27.480 --> 03:30.280]  are seemingly destined for Russia.
[03:30.280 --> 03:32.440]  It's weird, because as far as I know, they hit US shores
[03:32.440 --> 03:34.120]  yesterday.
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.080]  They should all be getting unpacked and on their way
[03:37.080 --> 03:38.560]  starting this weekend.
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.060]  Interesting.
[03:39.060 --> 03:41.020]  That seems like it's too early, though, right?
[03:41.020 --> 03:42.360]  Because what do you expect?
[03:42.360 --> 03:48.040]  I expect that they're probably going to go on sale this week,
[03:48.040 --> 03:50.320]  but they're not going to ship until the week after, I
[03:50.320 --> 03:50.960]  don't think.
[03:50.960 --> 03:51.920]  Yeah, it's usually the week after.
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.880]  I think last year, they took an extra week to ship,
[03:53.880 --> 03:56.080]  but I think there's just such massive quantities being
[03:56.080 --> 03:58.720]  shipped that they need to build up stock.
[03:58.720 --> 04:01.140]  And it's a massive enterprise that takes them a few weeks
[04:01.140 --> 04:01.760]  to do.
[04:01.760 --> 04:02.680]  Right.
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.480]  I can't even imagine.
[04:04.480 --> 04:07.800]  But anyway, some of these boxes for the iPhone 7 have leaked,
[04:07.800 --> 04:09.480]  and they're according to the box.
[04:09.480 --> 04:11.920]  And of course, the box would be the easiest thing to fake,
[04:11.920 --> 04:13.280]  and everybody acknowledges that.
[04:13.280 --> 04:18.760]  So take it with a massive grain of salt if you choose to.
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.400]  But the box calls these devices the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7
[04:22.400 --> 04:23.480]  Plus.
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.200]  So the least surprising names possible.
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.040]  Last week's box leak was 6SE, which was obviously faked.
[04:32.040 --> 04:33.480]  Yeah, I saw it.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.640]  That one, I don't know why.
[04:34.640 --> 04:36.920]  That one really looked fake.
[04:36.920 --> 04:40.320]  But it's weird.
[04:40.320 --> 04:44.320]  Some of these box leaks say that the phones include
[04:44.320 --> 04:47.880]  AirPod wireless earbuds, and some
[04:47.880 --> 04:54.000]  say that they include lightning earbuds and a lightning
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.600]  to headphone jack adapter.
[04:55.600 --> 04:57.800]  So I guess it depends the person faking the box, which
[04:57.800 --> 04:58.800]  their preference is.
[04:58.800 --> 05:00.640]  And that's what they put on the Photoshop.
[05:00.640 --> 05:01.200]  What do you think?
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.800]  Do you think that these boxes are fake,
[05:02.800 --> 05:06.120]  or do you think that they're legit, or what?
[05:06.120 --> 05:06.840]  It's hard to tell.
[05:06.840 --> 05:07.920]  I try to think of what Apple would do.
[05:07.920 --> 05:09.460]  And historically, they have not been great
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.720]  about including adapters.
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.080]  Famously, when they went from the dock to the lightning
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.720]  adapter, not only did they not include a lightning
[05:16.720 --> 05:19.760]  adapter in the box, they did not have any available at retail.
[05:19.760 --> 05:22.600]  And if anything happened to the one lightning cable you had,
[05:22.600 --> 05:25.520]  you were just totally screwed for a couple of weeks.
[05:25.520 --> 05:27.920]  And then other adapters they've had day and date,
[05:27.920 --> 05:30.560]  but they were $20 bucks, $30 bucks, $40 bucks.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.060]  They were never included in the box.
[05:32.060 --> 05:34.240]  So a standard Apple would be nothing in the box
[05:34.240 --> 05:35.520]  but the lightning ear pods.
[05:35.520 --> 05:38.880]  But we've had a lot of new Apple lately.
[05:38.880 --> 05:42.320]  I think that part of it is Apple being Apple,
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.280]  and that they can be stingy in those ways.
[05:46.280 --> 05:50.800]  And they can be, what's the word,
[05:50.800 --> 05:52.520]  for charging an awful lot of money
[05:52.520 --> 05:56.760]  for seemingly what should be a cheap little dongle.
[05:56.760 --> 05:59.320]  But I do think that with lightning in particular,
[05:59.320 --> 06:01.320]  there is a strategy involved too,
[06:01.320 --> 06:05.560]  which is that if it doesn't ship with adapter,
[06:05.560 --> 06:10.160]  it makes it more likely that people will buy new lightning
[06:10.160 --> 06:12.560]  adapter peripherals.
[06:12.560 --> 06:13.920]  Get on board with using lightning.
[06:13.920 --> 06:17.760]  We don't really want you to use the 30 pin.
[06:17.760 --> 06:20.080]  We'll make this available so you can have it
[06:20.080 --> 06:21.040]  if you really need it.
[06:21.040 --> 06:23.640]  But in general, you should start upgrading your things.
[06:23.640 --> 06:26.840]  Like if you have a dock by your bedside or something
[06:26.840 --> 06:29.280]  like that, just get a lightning one.
[06:29.280 --> 06:31.560]  There is a strategy involved with that.
[06:31.560 --> 06:33.600]  And it's a little different with the headphone jack
[06:33.600 --> 06:37.960]  because the 30 pin thing was a proprietary Apple thing,
[06:37.960 --> 06:40.360]  and Apple wanted to replace it.
[06:40.360 --> 06:41.660]  And it still isn't replaced.
[06:41.660 --> 06:43.200]  I was just in a hotel this week that
[06:43.200 --> 06:46.000]  had the 30 pin things on a lot of plugs.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.400]  It's more and more now.
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.000]  I'm starting to see some, which is much smarter, which
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.800]  is that they just have a USB.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.480]  So you still need your own cable,
[06:55.480 --> 06:57.680]  but then whatever phone you have, there's a USB thing
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.920]  and you don't need to fiddle with finding a power plug
[06:59.920 --> 07:00.520]  to plug it in.
[07:00.520 --> 07:03.120]  You could just plug it right into USB.
[07:03.120 --> 07:05.400]  But the 30 pin port still lives on.
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.760]  I just was in a hotel with them.
[07:08.760 --> 07:11.160]  But with the headphone jack, I do
[07:11.160 --> 07:14.500]  think that the iPhone shipping without a standard headphone
[07:14.500 --> 07:18.640]  jack will presage a shift in the industry
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.360]  and that two years from now, we'll
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.600]  see lots of high end phones that don't have a standard headphone
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.120]  jack.
[07:23.120 --> 07:24.080]  And it's been a while.
[07:24.080 --> 07:27.220]  I remember I had a Touch Pro, an HTC Touch Pro at one point,
[07:27.220 --> 07:28.880]  and I had an Android phone at one point.
[07:28.880 --> 07:31.160]  This must have been 2008, 2009.
[07:31.160 --> 07:32.800]  They just didn't have headphone jacks.
[07:32.800 --> 07:35.800]  And they had USB into these little breakout dongles,
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.040]  and that's just what you use.
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.720]  But then they all switched back.
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.800]  And now Motorola doesn't have a headphone jack.
[07:40.800 --> 07:43.200]  And none of those, I think, will ever move the industry.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.760]  But when Apple does it, they just
[07:44.760 --> 07:48.400]  shipped so many phones in such volume and a couple of models
[07:48.400 --> 07:51.060]  that manufacturers and accessory makers know that's where a lot
[07:51.060 --> 07:53.920]  of high value customers are that it absolutely does move it.
[07:53.920 --> 07:56.060]  So I've written about this.
[07:56.060 --> 07:58.120]  I'm fascinated by it.
[07:58.120 --> 08:00.940]  And to me, it's one of the most interesting stories
[08:00.940 --> 08:03.520]  of the summer, and I've really enjoyed speculating on it
[08:03.520 --> 08:07.280]  because it's such a simple issue.
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.400]  Now the phone doesn't have a headphone jack.
[08:09.400 --> 08:10.360]  What does it mean?
[08:10.360 --> 08:11.640]  And so you can go.
[08:11.640 --> 08:13.840]  There's so much speculation you can do about it.
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.300]  How are they going to go wireless?
[08:15.300 --> 08:17.080]  Are they going to go to lightning?
[08:17.080 --> 08:18.080]  Why would they do this?
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.880]  Why would they do that?
[08:20.880 --> 08:22.480]  Because the story is so simple, it's
[08:22.480 --> 08:27.160]  easy to really go deep on the obsessiveness over it.
[08:27.160 --> 08:30.360]  So I've really enjoyed the story, and I've also enjoyed watching.
[08:30.360 --> 08:31.960]  The reaction to it just as much.
[08:31.960 --> 08:34.120]  Yeah, the reaction is absolutely crazy.
[08:37.840 --> 08:38.680]  I mean, seriously.
[08:38.680 --> 08:41.160]  I mean, I met a guy this week.
[08:41.160 --> 08:43.880]  I was traveling, and just, what do you do?
[08:43.880 --> 08:45.800]  And told him basically what I did.
[08:45.800 --> 08:48.000]  He'd obviously never heard of tearing Fireball or me.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.760]  And he said, oh, that's really interesting.
[08:49.760 --> 08:52.520]  And he said, so this next question was,
[08:52.520 --> 08:55.440]  so is Apple really going to release a phone without a headphone jack?
[08:55.440 --> 08:58.240]  Just a random guy I was making small talk with for five minutes
[08:58.240 --> 08:59.720]  in line to get lunch.
[08:59.720 --> 09:03.360]  And that was just on people's minds.
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.040]  My favorite is Dalrymple, who gets angry at people who get angry
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.200]  that Apple's taking the headphone jack away.
[09:11.200 --> 09:16.200]  If these boxes are all true, or the ones that seem most true are true,
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.880]  it would suggest an answer to a question that I've had for a while.
[09:19.880 --> 09:30.120]  Which it seems to me that replacing the standard 3.5 millimeter wired
[09:30.120 --> 09:37.960]  headphone port with a lightning wired headphones is not really an upgrade.
[09:37.960 --> 09:40.120]  And it might be there are engineering constraints
[09:40.120 --> 09:42.680]  where if you can move that deep port from the phone,
[09:42.680 --> 09:45.240]  you can use it for something else.
[09:45.240 --> 09:49.880]  Again, it's not an issue of whether they can make a phone that looks
[09:49.880 --> 09:51.960]  the way they want it to look and still have the jack.
[09:51.960 --> 09:55.120]  But it's obviously, if everything you take out
[09:55.120 --> 09:57.440]  leaves space for something else, and space is precious.
[09:57.440 --> 09:59.280]  There's two really good stories that I've heard.
[09:59.280 --> 10:02.320]  And I don't know which one to put more weight on, or whether both are true.
[10:02.320 --> 10:05.120]  But one is that for the kind of waterproofing
[10:05.120 --> 10:07.800]  Apple wants to do, removing the headset jack is an advantage.
[10:07.800 --> 10:11.560]  And I know other phones absolutely do water resistance with a headphone jack.
[10:11.560 --> 10:15.160]  But Apple, if you look, Apple really promotes those EPA certifications.
[10:15.160 --> 10:18.000]  And there's all sorts of nano bonding and chemicals that you can do.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.640]  And there probably are more modern ones now that are really safe.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.200]  But a couple of years ago, that was really nasty stuff.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.640]  And it may just not be on Apple's radar.
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.640]  And the other one was they don't want this to be a story next year.
[10:28.640 --> 10:30.520]  Because next year, they want it to be about the new design.
[10:30.520 --> 10:33.600]  And if people are saying, nice new design, but where's my headphone jack?
[10:33.600 --> 10:36.800]  That's a way worse story than if people get the headphone jack
[10:36.800 --> 10:38.000]  and go out of their way this year.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.840]  And then next year, it's just smooth sailing into the new design.
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.680]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a little bit of column A
[10:42.680 --> 10:45.840]  and a little bit of column B, that both of those things may well be true.
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.840]  And I think that you've hit the nail right on the head in terms of,
[10:48.840 --> 10:51.960]  yes, there are other devices that have been made
[10:51.960 --> 10:55.680]  that have the standard headphone jack and are waterproof.
[10:55.680 --> 10:59.200]  And maybe, you know, I think that Sony has some good ones.
[10:59.200 --> 11:01.800]  Samsung, they have one, but they failed those two consumer reports.
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.480]  Right, right, right.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.960]  Samsung's had a bad run of it.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.040]  But yeah, that was exactly it.
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.040]  Like consumer report.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.720]  I mean, this is it really was a disaster.
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.040]  Like Samsung says this phone, you know, can be submersed.
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.960]  You know, it's seriously waterproof.
[11:15.960 --> 11:19.880]  Consumer Reports turned it on, dropped a tank of water, shorted it out.
[11:19.880 --> 11:22.600]  And it really is a bit of a bullshit standard because the dust egress.
[11:22.600 --> 11:23.320]  That's an absolute.
[11:23.320 --> 11:26.280]  You cannot have any dust in a vacuum at all go into the phone.
[11:26.280 --> 11:29.920]  But the water egress says, depending on what manufacturer says.
[11:29.920 --> 11:33.240]  So and it's also the phone that Samsung tested and certified.
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.480]  Yeah, that was waterproof.
[11:34.480 --> 11:36.680]  The one Consumer Reports, not so much.
[11:36.680 --> 11:42.120]  It's really not a very straightforward standard for the waterproofing part.
[11:42.120 --> 11:44.160]  And I do think, you know, it's one of those things.
[11:44.160 --> 11:46.600]  And I know that Apple is not first to waterproofing.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.560]  That there are, you know, Sony ones, Samsung ones, other people have,
[11:49.560 --> 11:52.120]  you know, whether they actually work or not.
[11:52.120 --> 11:53.320]  But they're not first.
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.880]  But I do think that Apple has quietly, without announcing it,
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.800]  been working to make their stuff more waterproof.
[12:00.800 --> 12:03.960]  I mean, and the watch, by all accounts, is, you know,
[12:03.960 --> 12:05.920]  not waterproof officially.
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.080]  But by, you know, people in the real world, it effectively is.
[12:10.080 --> 12:13.560]  You know, a friend of the show, Craig Hockenberry, swims with his every day.
[12:13.560 --> 12:15.520]  A lot of people swim with him.
[12:15.520 --> 12:18.440]  Tim Cook was saying he showered with it all the time.
[12:18.440 --> 12:19.920]  Exactly.
[12:19.920 --> 12:22.240]  And it's funny, because the iPhone 6S was re-engineered
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.680]  to be more water resistant.
[12:23.680 --> 12:26.360]  They put a gasket around the entire edge.
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.640]  And they sealed all the connections.
[12:28.640 --> 12:29.840]  They didn't advertise it.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.920]  I always expected Phil Schiller would, at some point,
[12:31.920 --> 12:33.980]  retweet somebody who said, I dropped it in the lake.
[12:33.980 --> 12:34.480]  It's fine.
[12:34.480 --> 12:35.320]  Thanks, Phil.
[12:35.320 --> 12:37.560]  But, you know, and they just taped totally quiet about it.
[12:37.560 --> 12:38.060]  Right.
[12:38.060 --> 12:39.000]  So they're not promising.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.840]  It's, you know, there's under-promising and over-delivering.
[12:41.840 --> 12:45.160]  And then there's not promising anything at all and still delivering some of it.
[12:45.160 --> 12:47.320]  And I think that's where they've been with the phone.
[12:47.320 --> 12:50.480]  And it sounds like, this year, they're actually going to begin promoting it
[12:50.480 --> 12:51.040]  as waterproof.
[12:51.040 --> 12:52.600]  And the headphone jack could be part of that.
[12:52.600 --> 12:55.280]  And we're going to see if it's like IP7, which is what the Apple Watch is,
[12:55.280 --> 12:59.000]  or IP8, which is what the Samsung phones are reportedly hitting,
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.440]  which is just longer periods or deeper submergence.
[13:04.440 --> 13:05.960]  Well, we're skipping ahead.
[13:05.960 --> 13:09.200]  But there was a Ming, Ming, what's his name?
[13:09.200 --> 13:09.960]  Ming-Chi Kuo.
[13:09.960 --> 13:17.040]  Ming-Chi Kuo report that MacRumors picked up that says IPX7.
[13:17.040 --> 13:17.800]  Yes.
[13:17.800 --> 13:20.240]  Which is equivalent to the watch, the current watch.
[13:20.240 --> 13:21.280]  But anyway, we shall see.
[13:21.280 --> 13:22.440]  He's talking, but he can swim with his phone.
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.200]  He'll be so happy.
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.920]  We shall see.
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.760]  Anyway, if these both boxes are accurate, that some of the phones
[13:28.760 --> 13:34.480]  are shipping with these AirPods and some are shipping with wired Lightning
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.320]  headphones and an adapter, it would clearly, if both are true,
[13:39.320 --> 13:44.160]  legit, whatever you want to say, it's going to be a paid upgrade.
[13:44.160 --> 13:47.160]  My guess is you either pay an extra $100 to get the AirPods,
[13:47.160 --> 13:49.840]  or you'll pay an extra $100, maybe $29.
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.880]  Although that seems a lot just for the wireless headphones.
[13:51.880 --> 13:53.040]  It seems like a lot of SKUs.
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.720]  If you had every phone available with Lightning or with AirPods,
[13:56.720 --> 13:58.560]  that's double, again, the amount of phones.
[13:58.560 --> 14:00.240]  They already have extra colors.
[14:00.240 --> 14:03.520]  They already have extra storage capacities.
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.600]  I think Apple is unafraid of lots of SKUs.
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.880]  I mean, the iPad has always been bifurcated in a sort of similar way
[14:13.880 --> 14:18.160]  where there's always been cellular and non-cellular models
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.720]  of every shape, color.
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.680]  Every iPad you can buy comes in a cellular and non-cellular version.
[14:26.680 --> 14:29.240]  So something like that sounds like something
[14:29.240 --> 14:30.800]  they're absolutely unafraid of.
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.160]  Or do you think it would be the higher end ones that have the AirPod option?
[14:34.160 --> 14:35.760]  That's another possibility.
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.560]  Another possibility would be that if you buy the 32-gigabyte one,
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.120]  I mean, again, we're making a lot of assumptions here.
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.680]  The rumor is that the new ones are going to ship in three size
[14:48.680 --> 14:51.400]  configurations, storage configurations, 32.
[14:51.400 --> 14:53.400]  Hallelujah, 16 gigabyte is dead.
[14:53.400 --> 14:55.160]  Thank god.
[14:55.160 --> 14:56.240]  Let's hope.
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.400]  And then no more 64.
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.040]  It'll go to 128 and then 256.
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.760]  And I could see that where maybe the 256 gets some.
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.640]  But that seems like you're, it seems to me
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.240]  like if they're going to do some in one and some in the other,
[15:13.240 --> 15:16.040]  they might as well let you mix and match however you want.
[15:16.040 --> 15:18.200]  And the pricing is always so interesting here.
[15:18.200 --> 15:19.960]  Hallelujah, that 16-gigabyte is gone, but there
[15:19.960 --> 15:22.840]  are a lot of people in enterprise who just wanted a dumb client that
[15:22.840 --> 15:25.080]  would hook up to their B2B website and apps,
[15:25.080 --> 15:27.280]  and they would get an 8-gigabyte iPhone if they could,
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.740]  just give it to all their employees.
[15:28.740 --> 15:31.960]  And they just want to cut every possible penny imaginable.
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.960]  And when you start getting 256 gigabytes,
[15:33.960 --> 15:37.040]  I believe they're doubling the density of the memory again, which means.
[15:37.040 --> 15:39.280]  And it's nice people say, just include an adapter.
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.640]  Apple should just double the RAM.
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.560]  They should just double the storage.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.600]  But all of those are incrementally more expensive.
[15:44.600 --> 15:47.760]  And when you have an incredibly margin-based business the way Apple does,
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.400]  any additional cost they put into that phone
[15:49.400 --> 15:52.040]  comes right out of the margin they're trying to hit for Wall Street.
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.240]  So it's always, for them, it's almost entirely a pricing game.
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.800]  Right, and even the pessimistic view, I mean, and this was, again,
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.640]  this is Ming-Chi Kuo saying that from the supply chain,
[16:03.640 --> 16:09.920]  they're saying only 65 million iPhones sold in the upcoming fourth quarter,
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.720]  which would be a steep drop-off from last year, where I think it was 80.
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.360]  But even so, 65 million phones.
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.080]  So that's a pessimistic take on how many new iPhones, mostly new.
[16:19.080 --> 16:22.240]  I mean, obviously, that includes whatever old ones they're still selling.
[16:22.240 --> 16:25.720]  But tens and tens of millions of brand new, never before
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.080]  manufactured iPhone 7s.
[16:29.080 --> 16:29.800]  It really does.
[16:29.800 --> 16:31.760]  I just saw, I don't have a link handy, but I just
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.560]  saw a story about how global DRAM pricing is spiking.
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.240]  And it's all specifically attributed to the iPhone and the ramp-up
[16:40.240 --> 16:43.240]  that Apple needs to make to make this absurd number of phones.
[16:43.240 --> 16:48.320]  So the story is that because Apple needs all of this RAM for the phones,
[16:48.320 --> 16:50.320]  and another one of these last-minute rumors,
[16:50.320 --> 16:52.440]  I guess it's not really last-minute, but it seems
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.080]  to have been reiterated last minute, is that the iPhone 7 Plus
[16:55.080 --> 17:00.280]  is going to come with 3 gigabytes of RAM instead of 2 gigabytes of RAM.
[17:00.280 --> 17:01.640]  So that just adds up.
[17:01.640 --> 17:02.960]  It's just lots and lots of RAM.
[17:02.960 --> 17:06.800]  So Apple's buying lots of RAM, which makes prices go up.
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.240]  Factories that manufacture RAM are shifting to the type of RAM
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.920]  that Apple wants to buy for the iPhones to meet that demand, which
[17:14.920 --> 17:17.880]  means they're making less for PCs.
[17:17.880 --> 17:23.040]  And therefore, the PC market for RAM is going up
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.320]  as a side effect of the iPhone 7.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.320]  And I forget which year it was.
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.360]  And I know we talked about this before.
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.000]  But the type of RAM is also different.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.120]  I remember for a while they were using TLS RAM,
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.760]  and they were using, I think it was, I forget the two names.
[17:33.760 --> 17:36.760]  One was multi-layer, and it was hard to get.
[17:36.760 --> 17:38.640]  If you just double the amount of the low one,
[17:38.640 --> 17:40.720]  it was much more expensive than using the higher one.
[17:40.720 --> 17:43.040]  And so they were using technically less expensive RAM
[17:43.040 --> 17:44.600]  on the higher-end phones, but that's
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.160]  what allowed them to get the double-sized memories.
[17:47.160 --> 17:48.200]  Right.
[17:48.200 --> 17:50.700]  Right.
[17:50.700 --> 17:53.640]  So it's, I mean, I'm glad I don't have to worry about all this.
[17:53.640 --> 17:58.080]  So my guess is if true, if true, both are true,
[17:58.080 --> 18:02.800]  that it'll be $100 extra to get AirPods in the box instead of.
[18:02.800 --> 18:03.840]  Nice round number.
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.800]  Yeah.
[18:04.800 --> 18:06.880]  And it kind of makes sense to me, too,
[18:06.880 --> 18:09.920]  that the adapter would only ship with the one that
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.120]  comes with wired headphones, where they're saying, look,
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.480]  if you're still into wired headphones, OK.
[18:14.480 --> 18:17.160]  Here's your new set of Lightning ones, and here's your adapter,
[18:17.160 --> 18:21.000]  so you can use whatever other ones you want.
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.520]  But the future is wireless.
[18:24.520 --> 18:27.480]  And I can see how that would be a big part of the presentation
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.160]  on Wednesday, that, hey, I could just
[18:31.160 --> 18:36.320]  see a slide where somebody's got the cord all tangled up
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.720]  and that the future is wireless.
[18:37.720 --> 18:40.200]  Yeah, I wonder, because you have just, Apple,
[18:40.200 --> 18:42.440]  and you did this so well in so many articles,
[18:42.440 --> 18:44.200]  Apple thinks about these things, and are they
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.400]  thinking we just want to get rid of the headphone jack,
[18:46.400 --> 18:47.480]  or are they thinking that we want
[18:47.480 --> 18:48.800]  to drive the wireless world?
[18:48.800 --> 18:51.600]  And clearly, with the manager book,
[18:51.600 --> 18:55.620]  they decided that they could put more than one USB-C port,
[18:55.620 --> 18:56.960]  but they didn't want to do that.
[18:56.960 --> 18:59.240]  They wanted to make a machine that had almost no ports,
[18:59.240 --> 19:01.000]  and there's still a concession for power,
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.200]  and might as well use USB-C. But they clearly messaged that,
[19:04.200 --> 19:05.800]  and it was on your show two years ago.
[19:05.800 --> 19:08.360]  Phil Schiller said, we wanted to make a computer
[19:08.360 --> 19:09.440]  for the wireless world.
[19:09.440 --> 19:11.600]  And if that's what they want to do with the iPhone,
[19:11.600 --> 19:13.920]  then this is the best way of doing it.
[19:13.920 --> 19:15.080]  Yeah, I think so.
[19:15.080 --> 19:18.800]  But I do wish, and again, who knows which of these are fake
[19:18.800 --> 19:21.560]  and which are real, that maybe they're all fake, but I still,
[19:21.560 --> 19:24.840]  if I had my wish, my wish would be that they would just
[19:24.840 --> 19:27.840]  go completely wireless, and just say, every single iPhone 7
[19:27.840 --> 19:28.920]  comes with AirPods.
[19:28.920 --> 19:30.920]  And if you really still want to use wired ones,
[19:30.920 --> 19:34.560]  you have to buy this $20 or $19 adapter.
[19:34.560 --> 19:36.280]  I really think that they should do that,
[19:36.280 --> 19:39.080]  but it sounds like, from these rumors,
[19:39.080 --> 19:41.160]  that they're going to make it an upsell.
[19:41.160 --> 19:43.560]  I think they need to hedge a little bit, because there's
[19:43.560 --> 19:46.880]  no amount of Q&A or savvy, even within Apple, that
[19:46.880 --> 19:49.520]  can equal millions of people hitting that product.
[19:49.520 --> 19:52.520]  And if it's a first generation, and they go all in on wireless,
[19:52.520 --> 19:54.120]  and there's anything wrong, they'll
[19:54.120 --> 19:55.760]  just be hammered beyond hammered.
[19:55.760 --> 19:57.960]  So if they make it one of those things, again,
[19:57.960 --> 20:01.320]  like the 12-inch MacBook, where people go out and buy it,
[20:01.320 --> 20:03.720]  it's a bit of a premium product, and it's a self-selecting
[20:03.720 --> 20:05.360]  group, and they have a higher tolerance.
[20:05.360 --> 20:07.120]  They are early adopters, and they're
[20:07.120 --> 20:09.480]  willing to sort of struggle with the technology at first.
[20:09.480 --> 20:12.120]  Apple can use the first generation as an experiment,
[20:12.120 --> 20:13.820]  and then realize, and the next generation
[20:13.820 --> 20:16.180]  is where they make that extra leap forward,
[20:16.180 --> 20:18.280]  and start cutting off things in the past.
[20:18.280 --> 20:20.200]  And I'm convinced, I am absolutely
[20:20.200 --> 20:22.800]  convinced that it's the way of the future, wireless
[20:22.800 --> 20:24.040]  in general.
[20:24.040 --> 20:25.960]  And I don't know, who knows what the details will
[20:25.960 --> 20:27.960]  be on these AirPods, how standard they
[20:27.960 --> 20:29.600]  will be in terms of their Bluetooth,
[20:29.600 --> 20:32.480]  and how much is proprietary.
[20:32.480 --> 20:35.280]  Will you be able to use the Apple AirBuds
[20:35.280 --> 20:39.600]  with other devices that use Bluetooth headphones?
[20:39.600 --> 20:40.200]  I don't know.
[20:40.200 --> 20:42.560]  Because Bluetooth is not great technology.
[20:42.560 --> 20:43.320]  It never has been.
[20:43.320 --> 20:45.160]  It doesn't like water, and we are human beings
[20:45.160 --> 20:45.920]  filled with water.
[20:45.920 --> 20:48.580]  So they use it for the watch, and the watch sometimes
[20:48.580 --> 20:51.080]  doesn't always have the best connection with Bluetooth.
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.880]  And it would be great if Apple did have,
[20:52.880 --> 20:54.420]  I mean, the best of both worlds would
[20:54.420 --> 20:58.120]  be a much better proprietary connection that failed down
[20:58.120 --> 21:00.140]  to Bluetooth for other devices, or if it
[21:00.140 --> 21:01.520]  couldn't make its own connection.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.020]  Right.
[21:02.020 --> 21:05.000]  But just use some secret sauce, and cheat if they need to.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.320]  And cheat meaning, hey, this isn't really
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.560]  as per the Bluetooth spec.
[21:08.560 --> 21:13.280]  But if we do it this way, it'll work better.
[21:13.280 --> 21:14.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.520]  Do whatever it takes to make it work well.
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.800]  Worry about how well it works.
[21:17.800 --> 21:19.560]  Don't worry about whether you're completely
[21:19.560 --> 21:24.480]  compliant with Bluetooth 5.0 spec by the letter.
[21:24.480 --> 21:26.440]  And the one thing I like is that Apple has always
[21:26.440 --> 21:28.120]  been a company that doesn't worry about chipsets,
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.600]  but worries about feature sets.
[21:29.600 --> 21:32.120]  And it goes all the way back to that Steve Jobs statement,
[21:32.120 --> 21:33.600]  where it's not like they have all these wireless chips,
[21:33.600 --> 21:35.800]  and they're just looking for features to put them into.
[21:35.800 --> 21:37.360]  They really want to do something,
[21:37.360 --> 21:39.800]  and they find the technology that can let them do it.
[21:39.800 --> 21:41.960]  Because there's very few rumors of wireless charging,
[21:41.960 --> 21:42.640]  for example.
[21:42.640 --> 21:45.120]  So you're still going to have to have some form of cable.
[21:45.120 --> 21:47.780]  And maybe they could charge through a metal casing,
[21:47.780 --> 21:49.560]  because there's been patents on that, I think, going back
[21:49.560 --> 21:50.320]  18 months now.
[21:50.320 --> 21:51.920]  But they've said before that they
[21:51.920 --> 21:54.240]  don't think that's a great technology in terms of power
[21:54.240 --> 21:55.760]  efficiency right now.
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.520]  So they're not just transitioning
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.820]  to wireless for wireless sake.
[21:58.820 --> 22:00.280]  It's something that they think we're on the cusp of,
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.640]  and they want to help push over.
[22:01.640 --> 22:03.480]  And that is, to me, one of the most serious
[22:03.480 --> 22:05.960]  practical considerations of this.
[22:05.960 --> 22:09.720]  The pain involved in moving away from this ubiquitous standard
[22:09.720 --> 22:11.960]  3.5 millimeter jack to something else
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.760]  is the scenario where you want to charge while you listen.
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.920]  And it sounds to me like that there's
[22:21.920 --> 22:23.800]  not going to be any kind of pass-through option
[22:23.800 --> 22:24.440]  for lightning.
[22:24.440 --> 22:26.080]  That if you're using the lightning headphones,
[22:26.080 --> 22:28.120]  you're not going to be able to charge while you listen.
[22:28.120 --> 22:30.220]  And so if you want to be able to charge while you listen,
[22:30.220 --> 22:32.560]  you should get on board and get some wireless headphones.
[22:32.560 --> 22:32.760]  Yeah.
[22:32.760 --> 22:34.880]  And then it brings you my colleague, Daniel Bader.
[22:34.880 --> 22:36.800]  He has both the Motorola and the,
[22:36.800 --> 22:38.200]  I think it's called Brasi, whatever
[22:38.200 --> 22:41.360]  the Kickstarter was for the wireless air
[22:41.360 --> 22:43.240]  pods that sound very similar to what Apple's
[22:43.240 --> 22:44.320]  going to be releasing.
[22:44.320 --> 22:47.000]  He still says he can't make it through a transcontinental
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.420]  flight, like he can't fly from Toronto to San Francisco
[22:49.420 --> 22:50.760]  on a charge with those.
[22:50.760 --> 22:52.000]  Wow, that's pretty bad.
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.200]  Yeah.
[22:53.200 --> 22:55.480]  My Beats ones have, I think I could easily
[22:55.480 --> 22:57.220]  make it through a transcontinental flight,
[22:57.220 --> 22:59.160]  but that's probably about pushing the limits.
[22:59.160 --> 23:00.480]  Well, yeah, and those are also, I think,
[23:00.480 --> 23:02.720]  if they're the same ones I have, they wrap around.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.400]  And I think these are supposed to be two independent ones that
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.400]  charge through the case.
[23:05.400 --> 23:09.080]  So it's unknown how efficient those power cells are.
[23:09.080 --> 23:14.080]  Right, mine are exactly what you said, they wrap around.
[23:14.080 --> 23:17.520]  It's going to be interesting.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.680]  What else on the iPhone?
[23:18.680 --> 23:20.440]  So the other one, we can skip right ahead
[23:20.440 --> 23:25.320]  to the Ming-Chi Kuo thing, which is confusing as hell to me,
[23:25.320 --> 23:27.840]  honestly, this aspect of it, which
[23:27.840 --> 23:31.040]  is that he says they're going to get rid of space gray,
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.920]  and they're going to ship two blacks, like a matte black,
[23:34.920 --> 23:39.600]  and what he's calling a piano black, which is like a, well,
[23:39.600 --> 23:43.160]  you can imagine, almost like a dress shoe glossy black.
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.120]  Like the steel Apple Watch black.
[23:45.120 --> 23:46.520]  That makes no sense to me.
[23:46.520 --> 23:48.180]  It makes no sense at all to me that they
[23:48.180 --> 23:52.320]  would ship two blacks, because it just
[23:52.320 --> 23:53.720]  doesn't sound appley at all.
[23:53.720 --> 23:57.760]  I can see shipping a gray and a black.
[23:57.760 --> 24:00.960]  I could see shipping gold and rose gold,
[24:00.960 --> 24:03.400]  because gold and rose gold are two different colors,
[24:03.400 --> 24:05.720]  whereas black is black.
[24:05.720 --> 24:10.000]  And based on the finish, it seems very strange.
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.560]  And I know that when you go to buy a car,
[24:12.560 --> 24:16.520]  if you go to buy a BMW, you can get black, and it costs x.
[24:16.520 --> 24:19.000]  But if you want to get the nice black,
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.440]  it costs an extra couple thousand dollars.
[24:23.440 --> 24:25.800]  It's an upsell, whereas I can't see them doing
[24:25.800 --> 24:28.600]  an upsell on the finish of black.
[24:28.600 --> 24:31.160]  No, I mean, the iPhone 3G, I think,
[24:31.160 --> 24:33.480]  you could only get the white plastic
[24:33.480 --> 24:36.000]  if you got the, back then, the 32 gigabyte model.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.040]  It was only at the top end of the chain.
[24:38.040 --> 24:40.420]  But since then, they've been very egalitarian
[24:40.420 --> 24:41.320]  with their colors.
[24:41.320 --> 24:43.520]  And I know when they did the iPhone 5, the space
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.240]  black back then, it was really, it's
[24:45.240 --> 24:46.400]  the hardest color to anodize.
[24:46.400 --> 24:48.680]  Gold is the easiest, and black is the hardest.
[24:48.680 --> 24:49.240]  And it chips.
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.880]  And well, we saw what happened with all the iPhone 5.
[24:51.880 --> 24:53.040]  So they went to space gray, because it
[24:53.040 --> 24:55.360]  let them do a thinner coating and a much more resilient
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.400]  finish.
[24:56.400 --> 24:59.080]  The Apple Watch is a darker version of space gray,
[24:59.080 --> 25:00.720]  but it's still space gray.
[25:00.720 --> 25:03.400]  And they might be trying some new finish that actually lets
[25:03.400 --> 25:05.240]  them go to a glossy piano black.
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.300]  It'll be interesting to see how well it holds up
[25:07.300 --> 25:09.760]  and just how many units they manage to ship with it.
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.760]  Yeah, it just seems strange to me that they would,
[25:12.760 --> 25:14.600]  that they would have dark black.
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.240]  And last month's rumor was space blue, so.
[25:19.240 --> 25:20.280]  And this is corroborated.
[25:20.280 --> 25:24.240]  There's the Japanese site, Makatakara,
[25:24.240 --> 25:27.640]  which has always been a pretty good track record of getting
[25:27.640 --> 25:29.320]  some scoops.
[25:29.320 --> 25:31.520]  They had a picture of the SIM trays.
[25:31.520 --> 25:35.560]  And indeed, there's like a matte black one and a shiny black one.
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.760]  And you never know which ones are prototyping, which
[25:37.760 --> 25:41.400]  ones are shipping, or which quantities are doing each in.
[25:41.400 --> 25:43.120]  It seems, they seem to really like,
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.240]  when they don't do radical design differences,
[25:45.240 --> 25:46.640]  they do a color difference.
[25:46.640 --> 25:48.880]  And because people are superficial,
[25:48.880 --> 25:51.200]  that's just as exciting to us as a new design.
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.440]  Like gold was for the 5S, and rose gold was for the 6S.
[25:54.440 --> 25:56.600]  And if this isn't going to be a big ticker,
[25:56.600 --> 25:58.360]  then just adding a new color for the talk
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.600]  will get a lot of people excited anyway.
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.160]  Yeah, I have to say, I've never, space gray,
[26:04.160 --> 26:06.280]  I mean, I'm always, I always get the black face.
[26:06.280 --> 26:09.600]  I don't ever want to have an iPhone with a white front.
[26:09.600 --> 26:10.840]  So I always get the black face.
[26:10.840 --> 26:12.800]  And so I haven't had a choice in recent years.
[26:12.800 --> 26:14.360]  It's always space gray.
[26:14.360 --> 26:15.680]  I like the blacker ones better.
[26:15.680 --> 26:19.800]  I liked the, I think it was the first iPhone 5.
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.560]  Even though it wore at the edges,
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.080]  but I thought that was a good look.
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.840]  I thought it looked good as the bevels faded or chipped away.
[26:28.840 --> 26:32.320]  I had mine re-anodized in three layers, like military spec.
[26:32.320 --> 26:34.640]  And it was just black on black, like totally blacked out.
[26:34.640 --> 26:36.120]  And it looked great.
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.080]  Yeah, didn't you get yours, like,
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.760]  but you got it changed to blue or something, right?
[26:40.760 --> 26:42.960]  No, a couple of people got different colors.
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.560]  They didn't want to do pure black, because it is so hard.
[26:45.560 --> 26:47.240]  So I just said, if I send you an iPhone,
[26:47.240 --> 26:48.600]  you can use me as a beta tester.
[26:48.600 --> 26:49.400]  And they sent it back.
[26:49.400 --> 26:50.280]  And I still have it.
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.280]  It still looks great.
[26:51.280 --> 26:51.880]  Didn't Whiskus?
[26:51.880 --> 26:53.200]  Whiskus went blue, I think.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.080]  I think so, yeah.
[26:54.080 --> 26:55.640]  And I know, and Deerbone went orange.
[26:55.640 --> 26:57.480]  And it was a couple other people who got them done.
[26:57.480 --> 26:59.480]  Yeah.
[26:59.480 --> 27:00.480]  So we shall see.
[27:00.480 --> 27:01.160]  I don't know.
[27:01.160 --> 27:03.200]  Seems like a, seems crazy to me.
[27:03.200 --> 27:05.360]  But I am a little surprised.
[27:05.360 --> 27:07.960]  I know, yeah, last month there were rumors of a blue one.
[27:07.960 --> 27:10.440]  Who knows where the hell that came from?
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.320]  But that was one of the things I've
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.560]  been wondering about all summer, as the drum beat of, hey,
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.320]  basically this looks a lot like the iPhone 6 and 6s,
[27:22.320 --> 27:25.920]  but with better, you know, the biggest cosmetic improvement
[27:25.920 --> 27:28.680]  from what we've seen is the better antenna lines,
[27:28.680 --> 27:31.920]  that the antenna lines are more placed around the corners
[27:31.920 --> 27:34.400]  rather than right across the back.
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.560]  But at a glance, the fundamental shape of the thing
[27:36.560 --> 27:38.240]  is pretty much the same.
[27:38.240 --> 27:40.440]  So I've always, I've wondered all summer, will they,
[27:40.440 --> 27:42.600]  you know, like you said, introduce
[27:42.600 --> 27:45.280]  new colors, which is probably one of the easiest things they
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.560]  could do, just new anodized colors, just to, again,
[27:50.560 --> 27:52.560]  just to get the word new in people's mouths.
[27:52.560 --> 27:53.960]  To show off they have the new one,
[27:53.960 --> 27:55.160]  it would be easy to see at a glance
[27:55.160 --> 27:58.160]  that you have the new one, the hot new phone.
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.760]  But it seems like no, other, at least
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.840]  on the silver gold, rose gold front, no.
[28:05.840 --> 28:07.560]  But they could probably put black faces
[28:07.560 --> 28:10.080]  on the gold and rose gold and sell a ton more phones, too.
[28:10.080 --> 28:13.120]  I've said that for years, that I thought that,
[28:13.120 --> 28:14.640]  I still probably wouldn't buy one,
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.080]  but I think it would be a great look.
[28:16.080 --> 28:18.520]  Yeah.
[28:18.520 --> 28:19.120]  We shall see.
[28:21.640 --> 28:22.880]  All right, what about this one?
[28:22.880 --> 28:24.120]  I got the pencil in there.
[28:24.120 --> 28:25.880]  Do you think the pencil, the Apple pencil,
[28:25.880 --> 28:28.840]  is going to work with the iPhone 7?
[28:28.840 --> 28:30.800]  So it's a very different technology.
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.760]  The 3D Touch uses the distortion of the LED light
[28:35.760 --> 28:37.600]  to measure the distance.
[28:37.600 --> 28:39.440]  And then it sort of translates that
[28:39.440 --> 28:42.800]  into pressure sensitivity, where the Apple pencil has a much
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.040]  higher screen refresh rate, just a far more sensors,
[28:46.040 --> 28:48.200]  and it has a bunch of technology in the pencil that
[28:48.200 --> 28:49.360]  determines that.
[28:49.360 --> 28:51.520]  And whether they can put both those things together,
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.800]  I don't know what the engineering,
[28:52.800 --> 28:53.520]  I mean, I would love it.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.560]  I would love to have an iPhone with pencil.
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.080]  It would be like Field Notes that syncs to Dropbox.
[28:59.080 --> 28:59.960]  It would be terrific.
[28:59.960 --> 29:02.040]  I just don't know if this generation's technology
[29:02.040 --> 29:02.920]  is there.
[29:02.920 --> 29:03.720]  I could see it.
[29:03.720 --> 29:04.640]  I could see that.
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.600]  And I know that the longest running, and again,
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.400]  none of these things are fact, but maybe we'll
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.560]  be surprised on all of them.
[29:11.560 --> 29:13.880]  But one of the strongest rumors all year long
[29:13.880 --> 29:18.800]  has been that the 5.5 inch plus sized phone is going
[29:18.800 --> 29:23.640]  to get the two camera system, and the regular sized
[29:23.640 --> 29:27.800]  4.7 inch phone is not.
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.960]  So that's a big, big difference.
[29:29.960 --> 29:33.080]  Actually, we should probably hold that for all segment.
[29:33.080 --> 29:36.600]  Because to me, the headphone jack
[29:36.600 --> 29:39.760]  is overshadowing the fact that the camera thing, I think,
[29:39.760 --> 29:45.720]  is bigger news technically, and bigger news historically.
[29:45.720 --> 29:47.680]  But given that they're already putting
[29:47.680 --> 29:50.960]  a pretty significant difference between the two sizes,
[29:50.960 --> 29:53.920]  I could see pencil support only being in the 5
[29:53.920 --> 29:55.640]  and not being in the 4.7.
[29:55.640 --> 29:58.320]  And it makes a little bit more sense, because it is more
[29:58.320 --> 30:02.880]  of that like, is it a big phone or is it a tiny tablet
[30:02.880 --> 30:04.360]  sort of size?
[30:04.360 --> 30:06.080]  Yeah, and going back, and we'll probably
[30:06.080 --> 30:08.400]  talk about that later too, but with the Galaxy Note,
[30:08.400 --> 30:11.040]  that was always the biggest redeeming quality for me.
[30:11.040 --> 30:13.200]  It was the world's smallest portable Wacom tablet.
[30:13.200 --> 30:14.280]  You could just hold it in your hand
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.640]  and have everything you could have in a Wacom tablet,
[30:16.640 --> 30:19.400]  and that's hugely advantageous to people in real estate
[30:19.400 --> 30:22.320]  and people in technical support and in all sorts of industries,
[30:22.320 --> 30:23.920]  and even just people who like to draw,
[30:23.920 --> 30:25.640]  who would love to have it without having,
[30:25.640 --> 30:27.320]  and I know it's not hard to carry an iPad around with you,
[30:27.320 --> 30:29.480]  but without having to carry an iPad around with you.
[30:29.480 --> 30:30.000]  Right.
[30:30.000 --> 30:30.480]  So I don't know.
[30:30.480 --> 30:31.560]  I could see that happening.
[30:31.560 --> 30:33.360]  Anyway, I linked to it the other day,
[30:33.360 --> 30:36.440]  and it was an interview with Tim Cook back in May
[30:36.440 --> 30:39.720]  that didn't cross my radar until just the other day.
[30:39.720 --> 30:45.320]  But he was in India, and he was interviewed on India's NDTV.
[30:45.320 --> 30:49.520]  And I asked him a question about Steve Jobs saying,
[30:49.520 --> 30:52.320]  you guys just introduced this pencil,
[30:52.320 --> 30:54.720]  but Steve Jobs said, if you see a stylus, they blew it.
[30:54.720 --> 30:57.320]  You know, it was out on your mind.
[30:57.320 --> 30:59.760]  And Tim Cook says, well, we launched a pencil, not
[30:59.760 --> 31:01.160]  a stylus, first of all.
[31:01.160 --> 31:04.360]  And there's a big difference, which I love.
[31:04.360 --> 31:06.440]  I love the answer that there's a big difference,
[31:06.440 --> 31:07.940]  just because they call it a pencil.
[31:07.940 --> 31:10.440]  And the things that people are doing with this pencil,
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.760]  I think Steve would have loved.
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.680]  He loved to help people create.
[31:14.680 --> 31:16.640]  And if you've ever seen what can be created
[31:16.640 --> 31:19.320]  on an iPhone or an iPad with that pencil,
[31:19.320 --> 31:22.760]  it's really unbelievable.
[31:22.760 --> 31:25.160]  Now, it was obviously a verbal interview.
[31:25.160 --> 31:29.160]  There is no comma after iPhone in this transcript of it.
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.280]  But I said either way he misspoke.
[31:32.280 --> 31:35.160]  Either he momentarily forgot that the pencil doesn't
[31:35.160 --> 31:39.800]  work with the iPhone, or he forgot
[31:39.800 --> 31:42.840]  that it only works with the upcoming iPhone
[31:42.840 --> 31:46.360]  and mistakenly slipped and suggested
[31:46.360 --> 31:49.600]  that that's forthcoming, that either way he misspoke.
[31:49.600 --> 31:51.560]  A couple of readers have pointed out
[31:51.560 --> 31:55.320]  that you could parse this as meaning just that people, what
[31:55.320 --> 31:58.960]  can be created on an iPhone, comma,
[31:58.960 --> 32:02.720]  or an iPad with that pencil is really unbelievable, right?
[32:02.720 --> 32:04.680]  If you pause in a certain way, you're
[32:04.680 --> 32:06.260]  not saying that you can use the pencil
[32:06.260 --> 32:07.480]  with the iPhone and the iPad.
[32:07.480 --> 32:11.680]  You're saying you could do creative stuff with an iPhone,
[32:11.680 --> 32:14.320]  and you could do creative stuff on the iPad with the pencil.
[32:14.320 --> 32:15.360]  So that's possible.
[32:15.360 --> 32:18.520]  But given that the question was specifically
[32:18.520 --> 32:22.080]  about the pencil and the Steve Jobs line
[32:22.080 --> 32:25.480]  about if you see a stylus, they blew it,
[32:25.480 --> 32:28.080]  that argument doesn't hold water with me.
[32:28.080 --> 32:28.880]  Absolutely.
[32:28.880 --> 32:31.320]  And I think, again, people love to misinterpret Steve Jobs.
[32:31.320 --> 32:32.540]  And I think what he was trying to say there
[32:32.540 --> 32:34.840]  is that if it requires it, because he had
[32:34.840 --> 32:36.160]  those terrible resistive screens,
[32:36.160 --> 32:38.080]  and a stylus was really one of the only ways
[32:38.080 --> 32:39.240]  to be functional with those.
[32:39.240 --> 32:41.920]  And so this is a completely different discussion.
[32:41.920 --> 32:44.640]  But Apple seldom, and it's not efficient,
[32:44.640 --> 32:46.520]  Apple seldom makes a technology that it only
[32:46.520 --> 32:47.440]  intends for one thing.
[32:47.440 --> 32:53.080]  Most of their technologies, like the Force Touch, like 3D Touch,
[32:53.080 --> 32:57.760]  I think we're going to see the True Tone and the DCI-P3
[32:57.760 --> 32:59.520]  displays, all of that stuff ends up
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.200]  going across their entire product line
[33:01.200 --> 33:03.320]  because it makes their products work better.
[33:03.320 --> 33:05.520]  And it's just a more efficient use of the technology
[33:05.520 --> 33:06.320]  that they create.
[33:06.320 --> 33:08.160]  They just have to pick one that goes first.
[33:08.160 --> 33:08.720]  Yes.
[33:08.720 --> 33:10.040]  Right.
[33:10.040 --> 33:13.040]  Yeah, I have always thought that if you see a stylus,
[33:13.040 --> 33:14.040]  they blew it.
[33:14.040 --> 33:16.600]  People really wag that one around
[33:16.600 --> 33:19.480]  as an example of things Steve Jobs said
[33:19.480 --> 33:22.320]  that Apple either wouldn't have done if he was still here,
[33:22.320 --> 33:24.560]  or ways that Steve Jobs was wrong,
[33:24.560 --> 33:27.480]  or however you want to put it.
[33:27.480 --> 33:30.280]  And I've always thought that was erroneous because I always
[33:30.280 --> 33:31.040]  took that answer.
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.800]  And I forget the context of the question.
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.600]  I think it was the introduction in the first iPhone keynote.
[33:38.600 --> 33:41.640]  But whatever it was, it was exactly what you said where
[33:41.640 --> 33:46.120]  the gist of it is he was talking about the Palm Pilot type
[33:46.120 --> 33:50.280]  devices, or even the Newton, to just throw one of Apple's
[33:50.280 --> 33:51.360]  products back at it.
[33:51.360 --> 33:53.200]  Devices where you had to use the stylus,
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.000]  not devices where you could.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.640]  And I think one of the ways that he would certainly know that
[33:59.640 --> 34:05.600]  is he certainly knew how popular the Cintiq tablets are
[34:05.600 --> 34:08.480]  at Pixar, and probably in certain departments
[34:08.480 --> 34:09.320]  within Apple, too.
[34:09.320 --> 34:11.680]  But he certainly knows that there's
[34:11.680 --> 34:15.440]  new well firsthand that there's a place for a stylus
[34:15.440 --> 34:17.080]  as an optional input device.
[34:17.080 --> 34:19.520]  Yeah, there's a huge difference between something being required
[34:19.520 --> 34:21.360]  for the usage of your product and something
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.400]  adding value to the usage of your product.
[34:23.400 --> 34:25.280]  And he didn't live in a time where there was that pencil,
[34:25.280 --> 34:27.800]  and could have been flabbergasted and delighted
[34:27.800 --> 34:29.080]  by how well the pencil worked.
[34:29.080 --> 34:29.920]  Didn't he also?
[34:29.920 --> 34:31.120]  I thought, did he?
[34:31.120 --> 34:34.200]  I know he bad-mouthed small tablets, too.
[34:34.200 --> 34:35.640]  Yes, you had to shave your fingers
[34:35.640 --> 34:36.840]  or whittle your fingers down.
[34:36.840 --> 34:37.320]  Right.
[34:37.320 --> 34:39.400]  And he was specifically talking about tablets
[34:39.400 --> 34:41.720]  where the user interface was shrunk down
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.960]  from a certain size.
[34:43.960 --> 34:46.280]  Whereas when Apple shrunk down the iPad mini,
[34:46.280 --> 34:49.200]  they kept the touch targets at exactly
[34:49.200 --> 34:51.760]  the same physical dimensions as they are.
[34:51.760 --> 34:53.680]  They're smaller than on the bigger iPad,
[34:53.680 --> 34:55.960]  but they're actually exactly the same pixels
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.520]  per inch as the iPhone.
[34:57.520 --> 34:59.080]  Yeah, I think it's super interesting.
[34:59.080 --> 35:00.560]  One of my favorite things about Steve Jobs
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.640]  is always that iTunes story where he just did not
[35:02.640 --> 35:03.840]  want iTunes on Windows.
[35:03.840 --> 35:05.040]  But he was smart enough to know that he
[35:05.040 --> 35:06.200]  didn't have all the answers.
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.200]  And he's basically, fine, Phil, fine, Eddie, go do it.
[35:10.200 --> 35:12.160]  But if you screw up, you're dead to me.
[35:12.160 --> 35:13.560]  And they went and did it, and it was successful.
[35:13.560 --> 35:15.720]  And my understanding is that originally, they
[35:15.720 --> 35:17.960]  were going to have a blown-up interface on the iPad.
[35:17.960 --> 35:19.640]  And he got fought tooth and nail over it,
[35:19.640 --> 35:22.280]  and they actually had time to make a two-column interface.
[35:22.280 --> 35:23.880]  And then he got turned around.
[35:23.880 --> 35:26.000]  Eddie Q read an article and brought it to Steve
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.640]  and bought one of the tablets and said,
[35:27.640 --> 35:28.520]  we really should do this.
[35:28.520 --> 35:29.840]  This is going to be a category.
[35:29.840 --> 35:31.160]  And again, he was resistant to it,
[35:31.160 --> 35:32.400]  but he was smart enough to know that he
[35:32.400 --> 35:33.360]  didn't have all the answers.
[35:33.360 --> 35:35.580]  And he hired good people, and he trusted them.
[35:35.580 --> 35:37.000]  And that team had to turn around.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  The iPad Mini, I think, was the fastest product
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.480]  turnaround they ever did.
[35:40.480 --> 35:42.660]  And they were lucky that they could shrink it down,
[35:42.660 --> 35:44.640]  and it happened to work perfectly
[35:44.640 --> 35:48.080]  because the size matched what the DPI was on the iPhone.
[35:48.080 --> 35:50.120]  I think they would have had a huge problem if that
[35:50.120 --> 35:51.360]  hadn't worked out for them.
[35:51.360 --> 35:51.880]  Right.
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.740]  And the quote that he had where he was clearly wrong,
[35:55.740 --> 35:58.080]  I mean, approvably wrong in hindsight,
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.280]  and nobody ever throws it out at Apple,
[36:00.280 --> 36:01.920]  and it's bizarre because this is one
[36:01.920 --> 36:03.480]  where he was absolutely wrong, was
[36:03.480 --> 36:07.480]  that the Antennagate question and answer thing,
[36:07.480 --> 36:09.320]  after the Antennagate press conference,
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.400]  and they had the question and answer thing,
[36:13.400 --> 36:15.200]  here's a quote here where he was talking
[36:15.200 --> 36:17.400]  about some of the bigger phones that were coming out
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.120]  from like Samsung Galaxy and the 5-inch phones.
[36:21.120 --> 36:24.920]  And he said, no one's going to buy a bigger phone that's
[36:24.920 --> 36:27.280]  so big you can't get your hands around it.
[36:27.280 --> 36:28.520]  No one's going to buy that.
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.760]  No one's going to watch video on an iPod.
[36:30.760 --> 36:31.920]  I mean, there's a few of it.
[36:31.920 --> 36:33.920]  I think a lot of times where no one reads books anymore,
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.340]  and then he comes out with iBooks,
[36:35.340 --> 36:38.120]  is that he wasn't afraid to change his mind when he was
[36:38.120 --> 36:40.080]  presented with a better argument.
[36:40.080 --> 36:42.840]  And they had, I forget if it was iPhone 4, iPhone 4S,
[36:42.840 --> 36:45.080]  but they had a large screen in that generation.
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.440]  But if you go back and feel how heavy your iPhone 4 and 4S is
[36:49.440 --> 36:50.880]  and how heavy that would have been,
[36:50.880 --> 36:52.520]  and the display technology, I mean,
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.600]  anyone who had an HTC Thunderbolt back then,
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.400]  that thing sucked.
[36:55.400 --> 36:57.440]  The battery lasted about three hours.
[36:57.440 --> 36:59.600]  The early Samsungs, they used that pen tile display
[36:59.600 --> 37:01.360]  technology, which was terrible.
[37:01.360 --> 37:03.760]  And they were willing to make these concessions in order
[37:03.760 --> 37:05.840]  to have those big, hot LTE radios.
[37:05.840 --> 37:07.300]  They had to make the phone bigger,
[37:07.300 --> 37:08.760]  and then they might as well put a bigger screen on.
[37:08.760 --> 37:10.400]  But you didn't have good screen technology,
[37:10.400 --> 37:12.000]  so you had to go OLED and use pen tile,
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.320]  and all these cascading ramifications
[37:14.320 --> 37:15.480]  of those decisions.
[37:15.480 --> 37:17.560]  And they were willing to suck it up and make
[37:17.560 --> 37:19.320]  endless variations of the same phone,
[37:19.320 --> 37:21.840]  where Apple's stuck to making one phone a year for a very
[37:21.840 --> 37:22.760]  long time.
[37:22.760 --> 37:24.680]  He even called the bigger phones hummers.
[37:24.680 --> 37:31.440]  I missed that guy.
[37:31.440 --> 37:33.200]  So yeah, there is sort of an argument
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.680]  to be made that I think in 2010, the battery life
[37:36.680 --> 37:37.600]  wasn't there to do it.
[37:37.600 --> 37:39.960]  But I do think, though, the proof shows
[37:39.960 --> 37:42.000]  that I think Apple institutionally was caught
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.320]  a little flat-footed at the popularity of the bigger size
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.160]  phones.
[37:47.160 --> 37:50.960]  The plus-size iPhone models were, by all accounts,
[37:50.960 --> 37:52.120]  a little bit late to market.
[37:52.120 --> 37:56.360]  I think it took everybody by surprise.
[37:56.360 --> 37:59.480]  Yeah, and I think to them, that's
[37:59.480 --> 38:00.840]  just adding addressable markets.
[38:00.840 --> 38:02.840]  They saturated AT&T, then they went to Verizon,
[38:02.840 --> 38:04.280]  they saturated North America and Europe,
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.520]  and they went to China Mobile.
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.480]  They saturated the under four-inch displays,
[38:07.480 --> 38:10.160]  and they went to 4.5 and 5.5.
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.620]  And they do it very progressively,
[38:11.620 --> 38:13.620]  and they had their TikTok cycle.
[38:13.620 --> 38:14.580]  And it just landed.
[38:14.580 --> 38:16.720]  iPhone 6 was the most convenient time
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.040]  and had the best technology for them to do it.
[38:19.040 --> 38:19.880]  And they've waited.
[38:19.880 --> 38:22.280]  They've happily waited, even when it's hurt them,
[38:22.280 --> 38:25.840]  to do what they think is right technologically.
[38:25.840 --> 38:26.880]  Yeah, definitely.
[38:26.880 --> 38:29.080]  Absolutely.
[38:29.080 --> 38:30.080]  So what do you think?
[38:30.080 --> 38:32.960]  Do you think they're going to do two shades of black?
[38:32.960 --> 38:35.440]  I usually dismiss this kind of stuff.
[38:35.440 --> 38:37.440]  And then I knew early on they were
[38:37.440 --> 38:39.440]  going to do the gold because they were calling it
[38:39.440 --> 38:42.560]  Kardashian, which to me was endlessly hilarious.
[38:42.560 --> 38:44.560]  And then the rose gold, it just seemed inevitable
[38:44.560 --> 38:47.560]  based on them already shipping a watch that had that color.
[38:47.560 --> 38:50.540]  But the space black Apple Watch, a lot of people
[38:50.540 --> 38:51.280]  really love that.
[38:51.280 --> 38:53.680]  Both you and I have it, and it's a great look.
[38:53.680 --> 38:56.440]  And I've joked that I really would love a space black
[38:56.440 --> 38:57.040]  iPhone.
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.000]  So I have no one to blame but myself if I get one.
[39:00.000 --> 39:00.880]  Right.
[39:00.880 --> 39:03.560]  Yeah, I wonder if that's the precedent.
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.240]  I don't know.
[39:04.240 --> 39:07.680]  Would you go space gray or piano black, John?
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.020]  Off the top of my head, I guess the piano.
[39:11.020 --> 39:12.680]  I guess I'd get that glossy finish.
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.200]  I don't know.
[39:15.200 --> 39:16.840]  You and I both have the luxury of we'll
[39:16.840 --> 39:20.000]  get to look at them firsthand in the hands-on area
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.400]  after the event before we make the decision.
[39:22.400 --> 39:23.640]  You don't have to judge.
[39:23.640 --> 39:26.440]  Because judging like a finish is the hardest thing
[39:26.440 --> 39:29.360]  to do, not looking at the actual device.
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.160]  Because a product photography makes everything look great.
[39:33.160 --> 39:35.320]  I mean, it's not like they're going to show you
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.840]  a product shot of the flat black that makes it look bad.
[39:39.840 --> 39:41.040]  It's all going to look great.
[39:41.040 --> 39:43.800]  But you can't really tell how they compare to each other
[39:43.800 --> 39:46.200]  unless you see them firsthand, in my opinion.
[39:46.200 --> 39:47.660]  And I don't think they could do a stainless steel
[39:47.660 --> 39:49.080]  phone with a DLC coating, which is
[39:49.080 --> 39:51.320]  one of the biggest advantages of that color.
[39:51.320 --> 39:52.920]  Right.
[39:52.920 --> 39:53.500]  So we'll see.
[39:53.500 --> 39:54.040]  I don't know.
[39:54.040 --> 39:55.660]  I don't know what to think about that.
[39:55.660 --> 39:57.320]  It just seems very strange to me.
[39:57.320 --> 39:58.440]  The other thought that occurred to me
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.000]  is that maybe the one that they're
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.680]  calling flat black or regular black
[40:02.680 --> 40:04.840]  might just be the new space gray.
[40:04.840 --> 40:08.040]  And then at least product marketing-wise,
[40:08.040 --> 40:11.160]  or if they give it a new name for a new gray,
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.420]  but call it gray, and then all of a sudden,
[40:13.420 --> 40:16.040]  instead of two blacks, you've got gray and black.
[40:16.040 --> 40:18.360]  Well, I think it will be, again, because it is just so hard
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.600]  to anodize black.
[40:19.600 --> 40:21.600]  It'll be space gray, but it'll be closer to what
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.680]  the Apple Watch space gray is than what the current iPhone
[40:23.680 --> 40:24.560]  space gray is.
[40:24.560 --> 40:25.480]  Right.
[40:25.480 --> 40:26.480]  Right.
[40:26.480 --> 40:28.320]  Well, we'll see.
[40:28.320 --> 40:31.360]  I think that that wraps me up on iPhone stuff.
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.520]  Is there anything else on iPhone you want to talk about?
[40:33.520 --> 40:34.520]  Just the camera.
[40:34.520 --> 40:35.600]  Oh, well, let's hold that.
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.220]  Let's hold that, because that's a big enough deal.
[40:37.220 --> 40:40.400]  So let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor,
[40:40.400 --> 40:41.880]  longtime sponsor of the show, one
[40:41.880 --> 40:43.560]  of my favorite companies in the world,
[40:43.560 --> 40:45.960]  and I mean that sincerely, Backblaze.
[40:45.960 --> 40:49.560]  Backblaze offers unlimited native backups
[40:49.560 --> 40:51.680]  for Mac and for PC.
[40:51.680 --> 40:54.480]  No credit card required, no risk.
[40:54.480 --> 40:57.800]  You get a 15-day free trial just for being
[40:57.800 --> 41:00.920]  a listener of the talk show at backblaze.com
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.160]  slash daring fireball, backblaze.com
[41:04.160 --> 41:06.640]  slash daring fireball.
[41:06.640 --> 41:07.720]  Here's how it works.
[41:07.720 --> 41:09.960]  You install their software on your Mac.
[41:09.960 --> 41:12.760]  You get a little control panel and system preferences.
[41:12.760 --> 41:15.360]  You turn on your free trial, and it just
[41:15.360 --> 41:16.440]  backs up everything.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.600]  If you have an external 3-gigabyte hard drive,
[41:18.600 --> 41:20.160]  it backs that up, too.
[41:20.160 --> 41:21.200]  Does it take a while?
[41:21.200 --> 41:22.440]  It depends on your bandwidth.
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.080]  However fast your bandwidth is, Backblaze
[41:25.080 --> 41:26.760]  will send your stuff up.
[41:26.760 --> 41:27.680]  Maybe it takes a week.
[41:27.680 --> 41:30.920]  I think it took a week the first time I signed up.
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.960]  After that, everything is just incremental.
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.040]  And you get this for just five, once the free trial's over,
[41:39.040 --> 41:42.200]  $5 a month for each Mac that you install it on.
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.400]  That's it.
[41:44.400 --> 41:47.120]  Well, that's just for a gigabyte or whatever.
[41:47.120 --> 41:48.560]  Then you have to upgrade them more.
[41:48.560 --> 41:51.040]  Nope, doesn't matter.
[41:51.040 --> 41:51.920]  One tier.
[41:51.920 --> 41:56.680]  Everybody pays $5 a month, and everything on your Mac
[41:56.680 --> 41:59.440]  gets uploaded to their server.
[41:59.440 --> 42:01.680]  They have iPhone apps, Android apps,
[42:01.680 --> 42:03.240]  so you can use the iPhone app.
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.800]  You log in with your credentials,
[42:05.800 --> 42:08.840]  and you can access any of the files on your Mac
[42:08.840 --> 42:10.080]  that have been backed up.
[42:10.080 --> 42:13.400]  So if you want to just quick get access to a file
[42:13.400 --> 42:16.040]  that you know is on your Mac from your phone,
[42:16.040 --> 42:18.400]  and you don't have it in Dropbox or something like that,
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.720]  you can use their app.
[42:19.720 --> 42:21.000]  There you go.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.520]  When you want to restore, you can restore one file at a time.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.120]  You can restore them all.
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.480]  They'll just, if you want, if you have disaster strikes
[42:27.480 --> 42:30.360]  or something like that, and you really need everything back,
[42:30.360 --> 42:32.440]  they'll put everything onto a hard drive
[42:32.440 --> 42:34.720]  and overnight it to you by FedEx.
[42:34.720 --> 42:36.800]  It couldn't be better.
[42:36.800 --> 42:37.560]  I use this.
[42:37.560 --> 42:39.080]  I recommend it to everybody.
[42:39.080 --> 42:41.040]  I'm not just saying it because they're a sponsor,
[42:41.040 --> 42:42.680]  but I'm happy to have them as a sponsor
[42:42.680 --> 42:43.760]  because I do recommend it.
[42:43.760 --> 42:46.240]  So go to backblaze.com slash daringfireball.
[42:46.240 --> 42:47.840]  And if you haven't signed up yet,
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.240]  do yourself a favor and do it.
[42:51.240 --> 42:52.200]  All right, the camera.
[42:52.200 --> 42:53.360]  Let's talk about this camera.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.880]  Yes.
[42:54.880 --> 42:56.560]  I'm sick about it.
[42:56.560 --> 42:58.920]  Well, you've been talking about it for what, two years now?
[42:58.920 --> 42:59.840]  Two years.
[42:59.840 --> 43:02.520]  Two years ago I heard, but I didn't hear it two years ago.
[43:02.520 --> 43:04.240]  I didn't hear that they were only going
[43:04.240 --> 43:06.880]  to put it in the Monster Fund.
[43:06.880 --> 43:08.760]  But I did hear, and it sounds like this
[43:08.760 --> 43:09.720]  is where they're going.
[43:09.720 --> 43:12.000]  And I think the invitation, I'm not,
[43:12.000 --> 43:15.680]  I don't like to read too much into the titles or the pictures
[43:15.680 --> 43:16.480]  on the invitation.
[43:16.480 --> 43:18.920]  But the invitation this time so clearly
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.960]  looks like a reference to what the camera terminology is,
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.800]  bokeh, where it's a Japanese word that
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.440]  means the visual quality of the out-of-focus parts
[43:32.440 --> 43:34.360]  of a photograph.
[43:34.360 --> 43:37.960]  So if you have a narrow depth of field on a photograph,
[43:37.960 --> 43:40.920]  what does the blur look like of the out-of-focus stuff?
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.640]  And that's what the invitation to this event
[43:44.640 --> 43:48.560]  looks like a reference to that, because it looks like very
[43:48.560 --> 43:50.280]  attractive out-of-focus, I don't know,
[43:50.280 --> 43:52.560]  like lights or something like that.
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.480]  And again, I think a lot of this just goes down
[43:54.480 --> 43:56.520]  to Apple managing their costs.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.680]  It's the same thing, memory.
[43:57.680 --> 44:00.080]  Memory is not $100 more expensive when you double it,
[44:00.080 --> 44:02.400]  but that's just an easy thing for people to understand,
[44:02.400 --> 44:03.760]  small, medium, and large.
[44:03.760 --> 44:05.960]  And the camera module is going to be more expensive,
[44:05.960 --> 44:08.360]  so it's easier for them to eat the cost of that camera.
[44:08.360 --> 44:11.640]  They put it in the already $100 because it's bigger phone
[44:11.640 --> 44:13.240]  than if they put it in both phones.
[44:13.240 --> 44:14.080]  Yeah.
[44:14.080 --> 44:16.800]  And what I've heard two years ago,
[44:16.800 --> 44:20.160]  and it sounds like exactly what they're shipping, is it's
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.040]  effectively two cameras that act as a single unit
[44:23.040 --> 44:27.400]  and through software create images.
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.280]  So two cameras take pictures at different focal lengths.
[44:30.280 --> 44:32.200]  One is wider ends langle.
[44:32.200 --> 44:34.400]  One is more telephoto.
[44:34.400 --> 44:37.880]  And then in software, it just stitches the two images
[44:37.880 --> 44:40.200]  from the two cameras together to create one image.
[44:40.200 --> 44:42.560]  And it might even have these light field type things
[44:42.560 --> 44:44.040]  where after the fact, you might be
[44:44.040 --> 44:47.960]  able to change the depth of field or the focus point.
[44:47.960 --> 44:50.040]  It's interesting because when you hear two cameras,
[44:50.040 --> 44:52.400]  a lot of companies have put two cameras on phones before.
[44:52.400 --> 44:55.600]  And some have done it where they have one regular camera
[44:55.600 --> 44:58.280]  and then one black and white camera because they want to pull
[44:58.280 --> 45:00.960]  more detail in low light situations.
[45:00.960 --> 45:02.920]  Some have a regular lens and a wide angle lens,
[45:02.920 --> 45:04.720]  but you have to actually shift between them
[45:04.720 --> 45:06.840]  with a toggle to choose which one you're
[45:06.840 --> 45:08.360]  going to use at any one time.
[45:08.360 --> 45:10.200]  And others have tried to put the lenses further apart
[45:10.200 --> 45:12.040]  to try to get more depth of field information
[45:12.040 --> 45:14.760]  so they can do that artificial or let
[45:14.760 --> 45:16.200]  you do dynamic focus with it where
[45:16.200 --> 45:18.960]  you can pull the image back and forth and show it differently.
[45:18.960 --> 45:21.160]  And it sounds like this is a very Apple solution where
[45:21.160 --> 45:23.280]  they're picking two really good cameras
[45:23.280 --> 45:25.760]  and then not making you do a lot of work,
[45:25.760 --> 45:28.080]  but using everything in that A10 chip and the image signal
[45:28.080 --> 45:30.000]  processor to intelligently figure out
[45:30.000 --> 45:31.400]  how to make a great image and then
[45:31.400 --> 45:33.280]  give you some control over things like depth
[45:33.280 --> 45:35.720]  of field and low light.
[45:35.720 --> 45:38.920]  And so, I mean, again, this is a longstanding rumor.
[45:38.920 --> 45:41.560]  And the fact that, apparent fact,
[45:41.560 --> 45:43.880]  that this new camera system is only
[45:43.880 --> 45:46.720]  going to ship on the plus size model and not the 4.7 inch
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.680]  model has been rumored all year.
[45:50.680 --> 45:52.200]  And it's not flush.
[45:52.200 --> 45:53.200]  It's not flush at all.
[45:53.200 --> 45:54.200]  Neither is flush.
[45:54.200 --> 45:55.800]  The camera bump is still there.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.200]  It is a slightly different shape.
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.680]  It looks like it might be a little bit more graduated
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.400]  instead of just like a harsh, like a more graduated bump
[46:05.400 --> 46:05.900]  than a.
[46:05.900 --> 46:08.200]  It's a hard problem to solve because people
[46:08.200 --> 46:09.280]  don't want heavy phones.
[46:09.280 --> 46:11.280]  And to make phones lighter, one of the ways you do that
[46:11.280 --> 46:12.240]  is to make them thinner.
[46:12.240 --> 46:14.320]  But cameras really want a big Z index.
[46:14.320 --> 46:15.000]  They want depth.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.620]  And if you try to, we've seen this with other manufacturers,
[46:17.620 --> 46:20.000]  if you try to put a higher aperture
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.600]  or you try to do other things with the camera,
[46:22.600 --> 46:25.260]  it creates aberration because the lens is not
[46:25.260 --> 46:26.960]  good enough at that depth to do everything
[46:26.960 --> 46:28.040]  that they want from it.
[46:28.040 --> 46:30.080]  And Apple up until now has been really, really good
[46:30.080 --> 46:31.460]  about hitting that sweet spot where
[46:31.460 --> 46:33.680]  the aperture and everything else about the camera
[46:33.680 --> 46:36.540]  comes together to take those really good everyday photos.
[46:36.540 --> 46:38.640]  They're not, no, the blacks aren't crushed.
[46:38.640 --> 46:40.080]  The saturation's not boosted.
[46:40.080 --> 46:42.760]  It just tries to reproduce what you see with your naked eye.
[46:42.760 --> 46:44.600]  And they've been really, really good about it.
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.320]  And I don't think they're going to change that any time soon
[46:46.320 --> 46:48.680]  because that, whatever, 300 person strong camera team,
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.160]  all they do is shoot photos in a wide variety of situations,
[46:52.160 --> 46:54.640]  trying to make sure that every photo you shoot at a bar,
[46:54.640 --> 46:57.160]  when your kids are out playing, that under any circumstance,
[46:57.160 --> 46:59.720]  you get the best photo you can.
[46:59.720 --> 47:02.280]  I would love to know how much internal deliberation there
[47:02.280 --> 47:05.000]  was over shipping, I mean, because once they broke
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.080]  the seal on it, like with the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus,
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.320]  shipping the 6S and 6S Plus last year with the camera bump
[47:12.320 --> 47:15.840]  was expected, actually, right?
[47:15.840 --> 47:18.160]  And that this one, the new iPhone 7
[47:18.160 --> 47:20.080]  is still going to have a bump.
[47:20.080 --> 47:20.820]  It's old news now.
[47:20.820 --> 47:22.160]  This is the third year in a row.
[47:22.160 --> 47:24.040]  But that first one, I would love to know
[47:24.040 --> 47:30.440]  how much internal argument there was over, we can ship,
[47:30.440 --> 47:31.840]  and what was the bigger argument?
[47:31.840 --> 47:35.000]  Was the bigger argument, we should make the phone thicker
[47:35.000 --> 47:36.760]  so that the camera fits flush?
[47:36.760 --> 47:40.680]  Or was the argument, we should include a lesser camera
[47:40.680 --> 47:43.880]  that would fit flush with this phone?
[47:43.880 --> 47:46.080]  Previous years, ID would just say,
[47:46.080 --> 47:48.440]  you have to make the, we're making the phone this thick,
[47:48.440 --> 47:50.840]  and you have to fit that camera, which is why, you know,
[47:50.840 --> 47:52.280]  people have thought that the iPhone camera
[47:52.280 --> 47:53.480]  didn't really improve that much.
[47:53.480 --> 47:55.720]  But getting a camera as good, if not better,
[47:55.720 --> 47:58.200]  than a previous generation, any thinner phone every year,
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.600]  was an absolute miracle of engineering.
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.060]  But there's two situations where I
[48:02.060 --> 48:04.560]  think ID gets pushed back on heavily,
[48:04.560 --> 48:07.000]  and that's antenna reception and camera.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.440]  Because physics, it's like that scene in Civil War
[48:09.440 --> 48:11.880]  where Spider-Man goes, I just don't think that shield follows
[48:11.880 --> 48:13.000]  laws of physics.
[48:13.000 --> 48:13.920]  And they have to.
[48:13.920 --> 48:15.160]  They have absolutely no choice.
[48:15.160 --> 48:17.000]  And their choice is put a crappy camera,
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.280]  which Apple's not going to do.
[48:18.280 --> 48:20.360]  Because they're as much a camera company now
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.000]  as they are a phone company, or live
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.040]  with a camera bump, which might, I'm sure,
[48:24.040 --> 48:26.840]  everyone in ID cringes every time they think about it.
[48:26.840 --> 48:28.660]  But it's how they get that great camera.
[48:28.660 --> 48:31.080]  And the other practical factor, it doesn't help me,
[48:31.080 --> 48:32.880]  because I don't like using a case.
[48:32.880 --> 48:36.800]  But overwhelming, I would love to know the percentage.
[48:36.800 --> 48:39.160]  I would love to know what percentage of iPhone users
[48:39.160 --> 48:41.160]  put their phone in a case, and keep it in a case
[48:41.160 --> 48:42.280]  almost all the time.
[48:42.280 --> 48:44.160]  Because I would, off the top of my head,
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.640]  I'm thinking it's at least 80%.
[48:47.640 --> 48:49.680]  I'm the only one I know who doesn't use a case.
[48:49.680 --> 48:51.200]  It might be even higher.
[48:51.200 --> 48:53.640]  80% might even be ridiculously low.
[48:53.640 --> 48:57.080]  And if you have a case, even the thinnest case I've ever seen,
[48:57.080 --> 48:59.120]  like the ones that are just like polyurethane,
[48:59.120 --> 49:01.400]  and are almost more just like scratch guards
[49:01.400 --> 49:03.520]  than any other kind of protection,
[49:03.520 --> 49:07.200]  are still at the thickness of the camera bump.
[49:07.200 --> 49:09.480]  So if you have a case, there is no camera bump.
[49:09.480 --> 49:09.880]  Absolutely.
[49:09.880 --> 49:11.800]  I mean, everybody in my family, every friend that I have,
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.840]  every colleague that I have has their iPhone in a case.
[49:13.840 --> 49:15.160]  I'm the only one walking around with it
[49:15.160 --> 49:16.440]  the way Johnny I've intended.
[49:16.440 --> 49:16.760]  Right.
[49:16.760 --> 49:17.640]  It really might be.
[49:17.640 --> 49:22.360]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's more like in the 90s, 90%.
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.280]  And so I lose out.
[49:24.280 --> 49:29.000]  You lose out as no case users.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.600]  But people with a case, they get better image quality.
[49:31.600 --> 49:33.360]  And they don't even, I'm sure they don't even
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.240]  know why we're going on and on for an entire segment.
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.360]  There's a bump on the case.
[49:36.360 --> 49:37.420]  Let me take it out of the case for a minute.
[49:37.420 --> 49:37.920]  Take a look.
[49:37.920 --> 49:38.420]  I forgot.
[49:41.440 --> 49:44.520]  I don't know what I'm going to do, Rene.
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.920]  Because you want that camera, but you hate big phones.
[49:46.920 --> 49:50.160]  And I really, I mean, and I've even, you know,
[49:50.160 --> 49:53.360]  I love the iPhone SE.
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.920]  I mean, I didn't buy one, personally,
[49:55.920 --> 49:59.000]  just because I knew that this, it just
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.240]  didn't make sense to buy one for six months
[50:01.240 --> 50:02.200]  when I just bought one.
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.280]  I mean, I feel like buying a new iPhone every year
[50:04.280 --> 50:09.000]  is already almost stupid.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.120]  I'm not going to buy two a year.
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.200]  But boy, I sure like the way it feels in my hand.
[50:13.200 --> 50:14.280]  I'm holding it in my hand right now.
[50:14.280 --> 50:16.200]  I sure like the way it feels in my hand.
[50:16.200 --> 50:18.640]  Yeah, and I think, again, this is just a transition period.
[50:18.640 --> 50:20.520]  And whether it's next year or the year after,
[50:20.520 --> 50:22.360]  there'll be an iPhone with as large a screen
[50:22.360 --> 50:25.080]  and as good a camera as the current 6S7
[50:25.080 --> 50:28.840]  is going to be, just in a casing as small as the SE.
[50:28.840 --> 50:32.400]  But my favorite thing, you know, I'm
[50:32.400 --> 50:34.080]  an avid amateur photographer.
[50:34.080 --> 50:36.960]  I care about the camera probably more than anything else
[50:36.960 --> 50:38.200]  on the phone.
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.160]  So buying the 4.7, just because it feels better in my hand
[50:42.160 --> 50:44.240]  and a lot better in my pocket, but knowing
[50:44.240 --> 50:46.640]  that I don't have as good a camera as I would otherwise
[50:46.640 --> 50:49.560]  is going to hurt.
[50:49.560 --> 50:52.600]  So the 7 will replace your SE or your 6S,
[50:52.600 --> 50:55.920]  and then the 7 Plus will replace your Laika or your Canon.
[50:55.920 --> 50:57.420]  And you'll just carry the two phones.
[50:57.420 --> 50:58.320]  Right, I guess.
[50:58.320 --> 50:58.960]  I don't know.
[50:58.960 --> 50:59.400]  I don't think it'll do that.
[50:59.400 --> 51:02.560]  Because they're connected and they sync, so.
[51:02.560 --> 51:03.480]  I don't know.
[51:03.480 --> 51:04.960]  I really don't.
[51:04.960 --> 51:06.160]  I've been dreading this all.
[51:06.160 --> 51:08.600]  I mean, I came to grips with it, and I accept it.
[51:08.600 --> 51:12.080]  And there are so many rumors coming out of the supply chain
[51:12.080 --> 51:14.480]  that showed pictures that only have the dual camera
[51:14.480 --> 51:15.240]  on the bigger one.
[51:15.240 --> 51:17.920]  So I'm braced for it, but now that it's here,
[51:17.920 --> 51:21.000]  it feels like all year long, I've
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.320]  been saying that's a problem for September John.
[51:25.320 --> 51:26.360]  Yeah, I'm summer John.
[51:26.360 --> 51:27.800]  Screw September John is his problem.
[51:27.800 --> 51:28.400]  What do you think?
[51:28.400 --> 51:29.980]  What do you think you're going to get?
[51:29.980 --> 51:34.040]  I've been using the Plus size now since it first came out.
[51:34.040 --> 51:36.440]  I buy both every year, and I occasionally
[51:36.440 --> 51:37.560]  use the smaller size.
[51:37.560 --> 51:41.200]  But I work on my iPhone so much that the longer battery
[51:41.200 --> 51:43.840]  life and the bigger screen size is a huge advantage to me.
[51:43.840 --> 51:46.120]  And I've gotten to the point where not as well as Bullseye
[51:46.120 --> 51:46.940]  from Daredevil.
[51:46.940 --> 51:48.760]  I can juggle that thing pretty well now.
[51:48.760 --> 51:50.080]  So I kind of forget half the time
[51:50.080 --> 51:53.160]  how big it is until I do pick up one of the smaller iPhones.
[51:53.160 --> 51:54.400]  So you're all set.
[51:54.400 --> 51:56.440]  I carry two iPhones now anyway, because I
[51:56.440 --> 51:58.520]  do a lot of pictures of iPhones, because it's just
[51:58.520 --> 51:59.280]  the job that I have.
[51:59.280 --> 52:01.040]  And I used to have a regular camera to do that,
[52:01.040 --> 52:02.500]  and now I just have the other iPhone
[52:02.500 --> 52:06.000]  to take the pictures with.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.440]  You have a day phone and a night phone.
[52:08.440 --> 52:17.520]  I have a subject phone and a capture phone.
[52:17.520 --> 52:19.840]  I make it so easy now, because everything just sinks,
[52:19.840 --> 52:20.960]  and it just works together.
[52:20.960 --> 52:23.840]  So I can pull out the SE or the 6, take photos,
[52:23.840 --> 52:25.280]  make a setup, take photos.
[52:25.280 --> 52:27.080]  And then those are automatically everywhere
[52:27.080 --> 52:29.500]  to put it away and go back to using it.
[52:29.500 --> 52:31.440]  I am intrigued.
[52:31.440 --> 52:35.560]  This is part of why I love the job that I have.
[52:35.560 --> 52:39.520]  I am absolutely intrigued to see how Apple pitches this
[52:39.520 --> 52:44.800]  on stage, because the previous difference between the two
[52:44.800 --> 52:48.560]  size iPhone 6 and the 6s was just the optical image
[52:48.560 --> 52:50.320]  stabilization on the Plus.
[52:50.320 --> 52:52.040]  The Plus, for the last two years,
[52:52.040 --> 52:54.200]  has had optical image stabilization.
[52:54.200 --> 52:56.920]  With the iPhone 6, it was for stills.
[52:56.920 --> 53:01.240]  And then last year, it was for stills and video.
[53:01.240 --> 53:02.280]  And that's no small thing.
[53:02.280 --> 53:04.920]  Optical image stabilization is a real advantage.
[53:04.920 --> 53:06.400]  It definitely means that the Plus
[53:06.400 --> 53:12.160]  had a at least slightly better camera than the regular size.
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.040]  But it was a small enough difference
[53:14.040 --> 53:15.880]  that I was easily willing to accept
[53:15.880 --> 53:19.720]  the size that I found more palatable in my pocket in hand.
[53:19.720 --> 53:22.000]  Whereas now, I think the difference
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.640]  is really, really significant.
[53:24.640 --> 53:29.200]  And I kind of feel, if the imaging is as good as I expect
[53:29.200 --> 53:33.360]  it to be, I think it's going to take so much of the event
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.200]  time for the iPhone that it's really going to,
[53:38.200 --> 53:39.360]  just the camera alone.
[53:39.360 --> 53:41.800]  If there's no other advertised differences between the two
[53:41.800 --> 53:44.040]  sizes, it's really going to turn the event into more
[53:44.040 --> 53:47.280]  of an iPhone 7 Plus event than an iPhone 7 event.
[53:47.280 --> 53:49.960]  Absolutely, and I often joke that the people
[53:49.960 --> 53:52.040]  in graphic design, all they're given is a spec.
[53:52.040 --> 53:54.040]  They don't have any, they're not disclosed on the products.
[53:54.040 --> 53:55.280]  They're just told to make an invitation.
[53:55.280 --> 53:57.360]  But I think it's absolutely fitting that this year,
[53:57.360 --> 54:00.280]  the camera is the subject of the invitation.
[54:00.280 --> 54:03.920]  I don't think that's an accident at all.
[54:03.920 --> 54:07.080]  And one thing I have, I've heard sort of two sides to this.
[54:07.080 --> 54:08.920]  I'm curious if you're hearing the same thing.
[54:08.920 --> 54:10.720]  There's one side who said that the Apple is absolutely
[54:10.720 --> 54:11.880]  shooting for an SLR, and they want
[54:11.880 --> 54:14.360]  to make a camera that's just way better than a smartphone
[54:14.360 --> 54:15.520]  camera before.
[54:15.520 --> 54:17.080]  The other side is, we really don't
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.480]  want to raise expectations.
[54:18.480 --> 54:20.480]  Because it's still a camera phone,
[54:20.480 --> 54:23.160]  and it doesn't have that huge piece of glass on it.
[54:23.160 --> 54:25.200]  And if we push too hard on it, it's like an SLR.
[54:25.200 --> 54:27.320]  People are going to see, well, it's
[54:27.320 --> 54:30.880]  not like my Canon with my 70 to 200 or whatever lens.
[54:30.880 --> 54:32.880]  So that's a really careful balancing act
[54:32.880 --> 54:36.040]  to make people understand that it's a way better camera phone,
[54:36.040 --> 54:37.760]  but it's still a camera phone.
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.560]  Yeah, the thing I heard was, when I originally
[54:42.560 --> 54:44.840]  heard about this dual camera thing two years ago,
[54:44.840 --> 54:46.680]  was I heard SLR.
[54:46.680 --> 54:48.800]  They're shooting for SLR quality.
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.160]  And it still doesn't make any sense to me.
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.600]  Because no matter what you do, what magic
[54:54.600 --> 54:57.120]  you can pull out of having two different lenses,
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.480]  the sensor size is still so small compared
[55:00.480 --> 55:04.280]  to a 35-millimeter full-frame DSLR.
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.480]  Or even the APS-C or the Micro Four Thirds,
[55:08.480 --> 55:11.920]  the other various quote, unquote,
[55:11.920 --> 55:15.720]  serious camera sensors, those sensors
[55:15.720 --> 55:18.840]  are so much bigger than the tiny little sensor
[55:18.840 --> 55:23.000]  that they have to use in the phone because of just
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.640]  how small the camera, the actual distance from the lens
[55:25.640 --> 55:28.280]  to the sensor is.
[55:28.280 --> 55:30.800]  I just don't see it.
[55:30.800 --> 55:32.320]  I think that they can really emphasize
[55:32.320 --> 55:37.840]  that this is as good as a standalone point-and-shoot
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.080]  camera, but I don't see how they can start talking about SLRs.
[55:42.080 --> 55:42.960]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[55:42.960 --> 55:45.280]  It's going to have to be like, this is the best camera
[55:45.280 --> 55:46.560]  that you can get on a phone.
[55:46.560 --> 55:48.020]  But if they start saying it's going
[55:48.020 --> 55:51.400]  to replace your 5D Mark or your Sony A, whatever Mark II,
[55:51.400 --> 55:52.720]  it's going to not work that way.
[55:52.720 --> 55:56.720]  When I say SLR as a sort of catch-all phrase for any camera
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.720]  with a sensor big enough that there
[55:58.720 --> 56:03.320]  are cameras for that sensor that have detachable lenses, right?
[56:03.320 --> 56:04.520]  Let's just say the catch-all.
[56:04.520 --> 56:06.080]  I'm saying SLR, but what I really
[56:06.080 --> 56:08.960]  mean is anything where the camera system has
[56:08.960 --> 56:11.880]  detachable lenses that you can choose which
[56:11.880 --> 56:13.360]  lens to put on the camera.
[56:13.360 --> 56:17.280]  And that includes, like I said, APS-C, Micro Four Thirds,
[56:17.280 --> 56:20.560]  the full-frame 35-millimeter size, any of those,
[56:20.560 --> 56:22.280]  lump them all together.
[56:22.280 --> 56:23.520]  I just don't see how they can say
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.440]  that they can compete with that simply because
[56:25.440 --> 56:27.440]  of the physics of sensor sizes.
[56:27.440 --> 56:30.840]  But in terms of the point-and-shoot cameras
[56:30.840 --> 56:33.440]  that people buy that don't have detachable lenses,
[56:33.440 --> 56:37.360]  I think that they can absolutely say we're as good or better.
[56:37.360 --> 56:41.760]  Because maybe what we lose on optics of the sensor size
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.040]  and the lens size, we're making up with software.
[56:45.040 --> 56:45.640]  Absolutely.
[56:45.640 --> 56:48.360]  And again, they've been very careful so far
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.660]  to target not professionals.
[56:49.660 --> 56:52.000]  I mean, they do show off what professionals can do with it.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.600]  It's that everyday photo thing.
[56:53.600 --> 56:55.520]  And they're also doing super interesting things
[56:55.520 --> 56:56.280]  with the camera.
[56:56.280 --> 56:57.480]  They're going to have that dual-lens system.
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.240]  But they're also, internally, they're going to support RAW.
[57:00.240 --> 57:01.560]  I think it's for third-party apps,
[57:01.560 --> 57:02.520]  only it won't be in the camera app.
[57:02.520 --> 57:03.800]  But they'll support RAW.
[57:03.800 --> 57:06.200]  They'll have that DCI-P3 display, which
[57:06.200 --> 57:07.900]  is a high-color gamut display.
[57:07.900 --> 57:09.800]  And the screens will be able to output that.
[57:09.800 --> 57:12.120]  So you have everything from the capture pipeline
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.080]  to the display and across other products,
[57:14.080 --> 57:17.280]  like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the 27-inch iMac.
[57:17.280 --> 57:19.000]  They can all display these images now.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.760]  And that is not something I think everyone
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.960]  will appreciate immediately.
[57:21.960 --> 57:22.960]  But I think once we start getting
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.640]  these things in our hands, everyone
[57:24.640 --> 57:26.760]  who loves photography is going to be just much more
[57:26.760 --> 57:29.360]  impressed with that phone than they thought they would be.
[57:29.360 --> 57:29.560]  Yeah.
[57:29.560 --> 57:30.560]  And the other thing we didn't even talk about,
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.640]  but the other thing that I've, I'm
[57:32.640 --> 57:33.520]  not going to say it's a sure thing.
[57:33.520 --> 57:34.560]  None of these things are sure things.
[57:34.560 --> 57:36.000]  But it's as close to a sure thing,
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.720]  I would bet on it, is that it's, like you said,
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.880]  it's a DPIC, DCI-P3.
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.840]  So it's the higher color gamut range.
[57:46.840 --> 57:48.320]  So it displays way more color.
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.440]  And you can definitely, if you have the right image,
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.680]  you can absolutely see the difference side by side.
[57:53.680 --> 57:55.320]  Like you said, you're going to be
[57:55.320 --> 57:57.560]  able to shoot those images from the camera.
[57:57.560 --> 57:58.560]  So you'll see it.
[57:58.560 --> 58:01.440]  And then it's also going to surely support
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.000]  the, not night shift, what's the other one?
[58:06.000 --> 58:06.520]  True tone.
[58:06.520 --> 58:07.120]  True tone.
[58:07.120 --> 58:09.400]  True tone display, where it changes,
[58:09.400 --> 58:11.800]  subtly changes the color temperature of your display
[58:11.800 --> 58:13.400]  based on the ambient light.
[58:13.400 --> 58:14.800]  And I thought that was a giveaway.
[58:14.800 --> 58:17.640]  I thought that, uncharacteristically, I
[58:17.640 --> 58:19.880]  thought Schiller gave up the bag on that
[58:19.880 --> 58:26.240]  when he talked about it at the iPad 9.7, iPad Pro, what
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.160]  do you call it, the baby iPad Pro.
[58:28.160 --> 58:31.480]  And when he said specifically, once you get used to this,
[58:31.480 --> 58:33.760]  you can't go back, which to me meant
[58:33.760 --> 58:36.440]  it's clearly coming to the iPhone in six months.
[58:36.440 --> 58:39.000]  And again, they don't hold back.
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.440]  There was this rumor that Apple holds back technology.
[58:41.440 --> 58:42.520]  As soon as they can ship something,
[58:42.520 --> 58:44.760]  they ship it, which is why the baby Pro got it.
[58:44.760 --> 58:47.180]  And they didn't just hold and wait for the iPhone.
[58:47.180 --> 58:48.640]  But again, that technology is going
[58:48.640 --> 58:50.600]  to propagate across their entire range.
[58:50.600 --> 58:52.760]  And I think at WWDC, they said that not only do they
[58:52.760 --> 58:55.680]  support DCI-P3, but they support the upcoming standard, which
[58:55.680 --> 58:57.440]  has an even wider gamut, which is 2020.
[58:57.440 --> 58:59.280]  And these are all cinematic standards is what
[58:59.280 --> 59:01.480]  we've been seeing in movie theaters for a while now.
[59:01.480 --> 59:04.020]  So they really care deeply about not just the photography,
[59:04.020 --> 59:06.440]  but every aspect of the photography
[59:06.440 --> 59:08.680]  along the entire blockchain.
[59:08.680 --> 59:10.800]  Yeah.
[59:10.800 --> 59:13.560]  So I think that's definitely coming.
[59:13.560 --> 59:15.760]  Anything else on the iPhone?
[59:15.760 --> 59:17.400]  I mean, one of the other things that people
[59:17.400 --> 59:19.640]  were getting upset about was whether the speaker was real
[59:19.640 --> 59:20.520]  or not at the bottom.
[59:20.520 --> 59:22.140]  That's replacing the headphone jack.
[59:22.140 --> 59:23.600]  And there was one rumor, I don't know
[59:23.600 --> 59:25.560]  if it was Ming-Chi Kuo or not, that they're actually
[59:25.560 --> 59:27.880]  going to upgrade the top speaker, the earpiece
[59:27.880 --> 59:30.000]  for the phone so that when you hold it vertically.
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.760]  Because one of the big things about the iPad Pro devices
[59:34.760 --> 59:36.760]  is that you have those four speakers.
[59:36.760 --> 59:38.880]  So you can spin it any direction, any way you want.
[59:38.880 --> 59:41.280]  And it's always fantastic stereo sound.
[59:41.280 --> 59:42.820]  But with one speaker on one side,
[59:42.820 --> 59:45.320]  either your hand covers it or it's only coming from one side.
[59:45.320 --> 59:47.240]  So I think if they do have that balance
[59:47.240 --> 59:49.580]  where they can put sound out of both ends of the device,
[59:49.580 --> 59:51.560]  then it just makes a better experience.
[59:51.560 --> 59:53.840]  Yeah, because that would actually give you more,
[59:53.840 --> 59:55.960]  that would give you stereo when you actually want stereo,
[59:55.960 --> 59:57.280]  which is when you're watching a video.
[59:57.280 --> 59:59.040]  Whereas having two speakers on the right side
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.640]  when you're watching video, it doesn't really do anything.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.000]  Yeah, it's better stereo in my right ear.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.440]  And they've had phones that do that.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.320]  They've had phones with fantastic speakers,
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.020]  but both at the bottom of the display.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:10.520]  Right.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]  Is it awkward?
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.280]  I wonder what the debate was inside about,
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.560]  because the rumor is that the speaker
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.920]  grills will be symmetric.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.480]  There will be symmetric speaker grills
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.620]  on both sides of the lightning port, but only one of them
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.720]  will actually be a speaker.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.160]  They used to.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.080]  Before they moved the headphone jack to the bottom,
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080]  when it was still at the top of the phone,
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.960]  they had sort of the mic had that fake speaker
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.800]  grille on top of it.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.500]  So to me, it's like a return to the old days.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.320]  Right, it's clearly just like a little visual,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.440]  just to make it pleasingly symmetric.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.720]  And they need a microphone down there too
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.880]  where you can talk into it.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.080]  So they have a lot of things that they have to,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.920]  it's sort of like when you read those threads,
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.120]  like Apple delete the bezels, do all this.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.920]  And there's components in there.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.440]  Like you can't just cut things off.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.520]  There's actual, they pack the electronics in there
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.680]  really, really tightly.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.840]  All right, let me take a break here and thank
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.200]  our next sponsor, another longtime friend of the show,
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:08.520]  Igloo, igloosoftware.com slash TTS, TTS for the talk show.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.080]  Easy.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.040]  Anyone who's worked in a corporate environment
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.840]  knows how painful intranets can be.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.720]  The content is stale.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.120]  The interface is ugly.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.520]  And you can't access it on your phone
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:25.040]  because it's rendered for like a giant desktop display.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.440]  Igloo is an intranet you will actually like,
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.320]  because it's designed for the user.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.600]  It gives you the flexibility to get your work done
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.360]  how you want, where you want, and on whatever device
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:37.840]  you want.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.000]  Igloo is truly building a product meant for 2016,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.720]  not 1997.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.720]  You could do all sorts of stuff on Igloo.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.760]  You can share news, organize files, coordinate calendars,
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.200]  manage projects, all in one place.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.480]  To-do lists, that sort of thing, they've got it.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.280]  The sharing news is sort of like a little micro Twitter
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.360]  just for your team.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.760]  So if you want to share stuff that might be considered
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.320]  competitive, obviously you wouldn't
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.520]  want to do that out on the public internet on Twitter.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.280]  So you can create effectively your own little private
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.520]  team-wide social network.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.400]  Really, really great stuff.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.760]  They've got all the social stuff you'd want, comments,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.280]  like buttons, things like that.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.240]  And anyone can add content based on their permissions
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.440]  with drag and drop widgets and a WYSIWYG editor.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.360]  You don't have to be a programmer to set it up.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.560]  You could just drag and drop.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.840]  It's very visual, really, really easy to set up.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.240]  And they make use of responsive web design.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.440]  So your Igloo looks great on any device
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.880]  from your tiny little iPhone SE all the way up
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:43.160]  to your giant 27-inch iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.920]  Go to igloosoftware.com slash TTS,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.840]  and you will get a free trial, and you can get started today.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.880]  Go check them out.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.520]  Let's move on.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.520]  Here's what else do we expect at this event this week.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.160]  I expect to hear about a new Apple Watch.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.360]  I don't know if they're going to call it Apple Watch 2.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.480]  I don't know what they're going to call it.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.880]  But for sake of argument, for sake of discussion,
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.840]  I'm going to call it Apple Watch 2.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.920]  The new Apple Watch.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:06.800]  The new Apple Watch.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.280]  I think they're going to, I think
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.040]  it's going to be a big part of the event.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:14.160]  I think that it is going to be really interesting to see
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.640]  what they've done, because it's really
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.880]  two years after the original.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.320]  It's not two years after it shipped,
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.720]  but it's certainly two years after it was introduced.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.720]  And at the meta level, compared to how much we seemingly
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.600]  know about the iPhone 7, including the boxes,
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.160]  the actual packaging, we seemingly
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.160]  know so much about the iPhone 7, almost nothing about Apple
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.120]  Watch 2 has come out.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.480]  Otherwise, the only thing we really seemingly know
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.720]  is that it's going to add GPS.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.200]  Yeah, I think it's similar to the early days of the iPhone,
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.880]  where they sort of knew where they wanted to go,
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.800]  but they took a very staged approach to get there.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.640]  And the original iPhone shipped with Edge,
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.600]  but then the next one came out with 3G and GPS,
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.680]  and then it just kept rolling from there.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.960]  And in this case, you're dealing with something
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.680]  that has a far smaller, they're not making tens of million.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.680]  Maybe over the course of the year,
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.800]  they'll sell 10, 20, 30, 40 million of them.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.720]  But they're not trying to put those in stores for day one.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.240]  And if the casing isn't changing,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.720]  then it's very hard to differentiate
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.480]  what's an Apple Watch 2 from an Apple Watch
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.240]  1, just in terms of leaks on Sino Weibo or places like that.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.800]  Yeah, so that would be one explanation
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.600]  for why it hasn't leaked would be if the physical dimensions
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.800]  are unchanged.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.800]  Yeah, no new color, and if it's the same casing,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.160]  it's very hard to get a leak out of it.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.080]  I wonder.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.240]  I don't know.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.160]  This is one of those things where I really
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.840]  hope it doesn't leak last minute while I'm on the airplane
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.040]  flying out there, because I love the idea of going
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.240]  into the event not knowing what the heck they're going
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.560]  to say about Apple Watch 2.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.640]  That's one of the funniest things to me
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.220]  is I keep getting these tweets from people who
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.760]  say that the event's going to be boring because they know
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.600]  everything is going to happen.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.720]  It's like reading the script to the next Star Wars movie
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.040]  and then going to the theater and saying, oh, it's boring.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.880]  I knew what happened.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.280]  I read the script.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.200]  Just pick one.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.560]  But I don't think that's true.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.320]  I think that the iPhone part might be,
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:07.720]  although I'm intrigued at how they're
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.960]  going to brag about the iPhone.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.680]  Like I said before, how they're going
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.480]  to brag about the iPhone 7 Plus camera
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.640]  without making the regular iPhone 7 camera
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.560]  look like a weakling.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.120]  Absolutely.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.680]  To me, I don't write rumors anymore,
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.360]  and the reason for that is there's always
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.560]  going to be new iPhones.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.240]  Unless Apple peaces out, drops the mic,
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.800]  and says we're going into hot tubs,
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.960]  every year there's going to be a new iPhone.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.460]  And that's not as interesting to me
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.000]  as what problems they're going to try to solve,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.080]  and especially the way they're going to try to solve it.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.600]  And that always requires a story,
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.120]  and you very seldom get a story out of the leaks.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.680]  Right, so I'm curious.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:44.120]  And who knows, maybe it's not physically
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.520]  identical to the old Apple Watch,
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.360]  and they've simply maintained secrecy up until the point
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.760]  where they announce it.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.120]  Tim Cook goes home every night, puts on his secret Apple Watch.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.440]  Right.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.040]  I really, really don't know what to expect in that regard.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:58.960]  Here's a question.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.680]  Do you think that Apple Watch Edition will still exist?
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.720]  We talked about this in person, whether there
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.220]  was going to be a second generation,
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.760]  or whether they would just add new finishes,
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.280]  like would they add white gold, or titanium, or something
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:13.800]  to that line.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.600]  Because there's a lot you can do in the high-end watch line.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.000]  And I know people made fun of it,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.040]  but there is a group of people who buy $25,000 tickets
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.320]  to the Emirates, and $20,000 dresses,
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.280]  or tuxedos they wear once, or rent five-star or six-star
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.200]  hotel rooms for exorbitant price.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.960]  And to them, it really is next to nothing.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.400]  It's like us buying an iPad, an iPod sock.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.240]  And that is a market.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.120]  I don't think it was a great market for them,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.280]  so it might just be a distraction.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.920]  My guess is we won't hear about them,
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.000]  because we haven't heard about them in a really long time.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.800]  And I think they would have stoked that fire.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.120]  We never saw the release of the gold link bracelet,
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:47.760]  for example.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.520]  And I think they would have done more
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.960]  to keep it alive if they really meant for that product line
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.840]  to continue.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.520]  Yeah, my gut feeling is that the Apple Watch Edition just
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.720]  goes into the memory hole.
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.840]  They're just not going to talk about it.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.960]  And you and I, we have spoken about it.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.120]  I don't forget if we talked on the show,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.560]  but I know we've spoken in Persian,
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.440]  where I feel like one of the ways, part of it
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.520]  is that Apple doesn't see the future.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.360]  They have ideas.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.840]  They have guesses as to what's going to be popular,
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.040]  but that they don't have the magical ability to know
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.080]  exactly what people will buy.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.120]  And they keep their eyes open after they come out
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.800]  with something, and they adjust.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.000]  And I think that the way that they've adjusted,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.760]  I think that the way that they're addressing the luxury
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.400]  market is with the Hermes line.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.280]  And it's obviously, those watches
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.480]  are significantly less than the gold, even the cheapest
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.240]  of the gold edition ones.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.200]  But they're a lot more than the regular stainless steel Apple
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:50.960]  watches.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.600]  And they're a lot less.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.680]  I went into the SFO, the international terminal.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.240]  They have a Hermes store.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.800]  And the Hermes actual watch bands are way more expensive.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.800]  I think it was like $3,000 to $6,000
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.840]  for the double tour for the Hermes watch,
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.480]  where it's only like $1,000 something, only $500 or $600
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.320]  or $1,000 for the Apple Watch version.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.480]  Yeah, it's actually a cheaper Hermes watch
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.720]  than the regular Hermes watches, even though it's
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.920]  a more expensive Apple Watch.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.080]  And I kind of feel like that's the sweet spot for Apple Watch
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.800]  in terms of the highest price points that you want to hit.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.480]  And I would not be surprised in the least
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.800]  if they have more stuff from Hermes.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.160]  And I wouldn't be surprised if they keep Hermes around and
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.080]  maybe add another similar brand of similar stature to a Hermes
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.840]  and have, for example, Gucci ones or something like that.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.560]  Absolutely.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.120]  And the first generation of any product is awkward.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.720]  The first iPhone, they did a lot of changes for the second one.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.760]  The iPad 2, they had much better focus for that
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.560]  than they had on the iPad 1.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.360]  And with the Apple Watch, arguably,
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:54.080]  they went to market way sooner.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.560]  There was 10 years of tablets before the iPad and 10 years
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.200]  of smartphones before the iPhone.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.200]  And there were very few years of smartwatch.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.040]  So they were part of the discovery process.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.080]  They couldn't just sit back and look at everybody else's
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.720]  mistakes and then come out with a coherent product.
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.600]  And you could see that in the original Apple Watch demo.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.720]  It didn't have that minimal delightful product
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.000]  feel the way you had with the original iPhone, where, oh,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.960]  just look at the Photos app.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.460]  It's amazing.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.200]  I can pinch and zoom and do all these things.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.720]  And you'd sell them to every friend
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.800]  you had who just wanted to do the same thing.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.000]  It was like five different, six different functions.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.640]  And now we've seen with a watchOS 3,
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.960]  it's very clearly it's fitness and notifications.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.760]  There's far fewer things.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.040]  And I think that's why we're seeing GPS.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.300]  GPS is going to be of much more use to people who
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.100]  are into fitness and jogging.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.600]  And we've seen people on campus who wear an Apple Watch
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.360]  and a Garmin because they're serious fitness people.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.440]  And they have to have GPS with them.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.020]  And it addresses part of what I think
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.560]  is a narrower focus for the Apple Watch going forward.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.920]  Yeah, I think that GPS is to the Apple Watch
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.240]  to what 3G was to the iPhone.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.280]  Although, I guess the iPhone with the iPhone 3G,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.720]  it gained GPS, too.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.280]  Yes.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.780]  Right?
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.120]  Remember the first iPhone?
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.280]  You'd use cell phone triangulation to tell you where.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.200]  And Wi-Fi mapping.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.760]  Right.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.120]  Like it was one of those Tony Stark expos explaining
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.520]  the technology for the first time.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.240]  I love that phone.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.800]  But it's so laughable.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.880]  But I don't think the GPS.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.840]  I know for some people, I guess GPS was a big deal
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.680]  for the iPhone, too.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.120]  But to me, the 3G was the one where it's like, man,
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.320]  they just couldn't fit it in the first year,
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.440]  but still thought it was worth shipping what they could do.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.240]  And I think that ideally, GPS is the one thing they really
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.740]  would have wanted to have all along.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.360]  Because they obviously saw this as a fitness device.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.700]  It was one of the main three tentpole descriptions
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.080]  of what it does.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.440]  And it just didn't fit.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.680]  Well, the current Apple Watch, the first generation Apple
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.520]  Watch runs at the thermal limit of that casing already.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.240]  And again, Apple's not a dumb company.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.440]  They have billions of dollars.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.920]  They can prototype everything.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.880]  And from the beginning, they've wanted a GPS,
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.080]  and they've wanted cellular.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080]  But when you look at how hot that thing is already
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.640]  and what the battery life is already,
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.240]  it takes time to get to those things.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.640]  And now they feel confident that they can add GPS
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.280]  and maintain battery life and maintain the thermals.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.640]  I think for them, LTE still melts your wrist off
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.360]  or depletes the device quickly.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.540]  But as soon as that's solved, I'm absolutely sure
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.680]  they'll roll out the version with the LTE as well.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.920]  That doesn't make, I'm sure it'll happen eventually.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.680]  But it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]  to be a top priority.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.200]  Because I just don't think many people are really
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.760]  looking to have another monthly cellular bill.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.760]  I guess it depends how the carriers, absolutely.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.640]  I guess it depends how the carriers see it.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.680]  It is probably a theory that eventually there'll
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.280]  be something past the smartwatch.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.660]  And we don't know what that is yet
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.040]  or what the capabilities will be.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.600]  But maybe it's a wearable device.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.640]  And right now the Apple Watch is like, again,
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.240]  like a shuttlecraft to the Starship that's the iPhone.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.200]  But eventually it might be its own ship
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.640]  and can basically do everything if you want it to by itself.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.960]  And then you don't have to worry about
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.840]  carrying a phone with you.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.720]  Right, and I realize that there is,
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.000]  it ties into the fitness angle, right?
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.920]  Where there are certain physical activities
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.160]  where you'd be happy to wear a watch
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.080]  but would prefer not to have to bring your phone.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.760]  Because it's hard, if you're just going running,
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.440]  it is, you've got to get a special pocket or an armband
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.880]  or a sack around your waist,
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.360]  whatever those things are called.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.960]  It's a pain to keep your phone with you when you run.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.160]  But for most of those things,
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.720]  I don't really care if I have internet access.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.720]  GPS is a bigger difference for tracking distance
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.560]  and stuff like that.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.880]  But if I can't get notifications, who cares?
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.560]  Maybe it'll be like the iPad.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.460]  And eventually there'll be a market
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.720]  for the few people who want it.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.280]  And then every other model will just stay Wi-Fi
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280]  for a few years.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.320]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if that's a few years out,
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.560]  though, not like even a next year thing.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.800]  That's why I found that Bloomberg story emphasizing
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.640]  that there probably wasn't going to be cellular
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.480]  in this year's phone.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.320]  And even if it was,
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.680]  it wouldn't ship until December at the earliest.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.600]  I found that whole story to be ridiculous.
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.440]  Again, they've had a cellular prototype
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.720]  since before they shipped the iPhone.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.000]  So I'm sure, and I'm sure every carrier keeps asking,
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.840]  are you going to do one?
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.680]  Are you going to do one?
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.240]  But it doesn't sound...
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.360]  Right, because the carriers,
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.160]  I think the carriers are the ones that are most interested
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.840]  in charging you another $15 a month
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.640]  or whatever it would cost.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.200]  I had the most interesting conversation
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.960]  with one of the people in PR for a cell phone company
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.400]  when I was asking about the shared plans,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.360]  because they were trying to tell me
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.880]  how you could just add an iPad to your plan.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.280]  It was just $15 more.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.640]  And I kept asking, why?
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.480]  Why isn't it free?
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.300]  And they said, what do you mean?
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.240]  I said, if I order a pizza and I split it with John,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.120]  you don't charge me more
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.400]  because I'm splitting the pizza with John.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.440]  It's the same pizza.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.680]  And they just kept insisting that the data was different
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.940]  because I was using it with two people.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:32.780]  Well, you know what, though?
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.840]  You will get, there are at certain restaurants,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:35.680]  at a higher end restaurant,
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.120]  you will get charged for a shared plan.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:37.960]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.380]  So it's not like it's without precedent, but it's, you know,
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.280]  I'm with you more on the pizza side.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.200]  I kind of feel like, you know,
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.620]  for what I pay Verizon every month,
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.360]  I should be able to hook up more devices.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.200]  Absolutely.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.040]  And just when you're done with your data,
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:52.860]  you're done with your data.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.700]  That's your problem.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.720]  And I'm not asking for more gigabytes, right?
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.680]  That just, you know,
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.640]  just let me use my gigabytes on whatever devices I want.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.840]  Yeah, but I don't think they see it that way.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.880]  No, they don't want to be dead dumb pipes.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.640]  Last thing that they want.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.040]  What do you think about,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.280]  I think it's gotta be a sure thing
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.360]  that there's gonna be a new lineup of bands.
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.840]  It seems like they do spring and fall new watch bands.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.640]  This just seems like it's part of the pattern.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.200]  I mean, again, it's two years in,
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.040]  but it just seems like this is part of the pattern
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.080]  of Apple Watch.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.780]  Yeah, and we got new watch bands last iPhone event.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.480]  I think that was the debut of the Hermes bands.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.840]  And then at the March event,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.280]  we got the woven nylon bands.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.160]  So I'd be interested to see if we just get new colors
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.060]  or like you said, there's a new partnership announced
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.580]  or there is a new style of band announced
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.660]  or what they could do there.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.800]  I'd also love them to just take this,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.200]  for example, you can still only get the loop
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.160]  in the 42 millimeter.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.840]  And I know a lot of people who would love that
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.360]  on the 38 millimeter and sort of just round out
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.800]  the way they handle the distribution.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.240]  Yeah, I think it's gotta be a sure thing.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.680]  And I totally expect them to be compatible
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.200]  with the new Apple Watch.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.760]  Yeah, I have so many bands, John.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.320]  I know, but you've got like a real problem.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.120]  Yes, I absolutely do.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.400]  And it's not even just that you're gonna want it,
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.800]  you're gonna get the new Apple Watch
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.200]  and you're gonna want to use your old bands.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.280]  But if they're not compatible,
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.280]  you're gonna get confused as to which ones, you know.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.440]  I'll have to burn the old ones.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.240]  I don't get confused or something.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.240]  I think the Apple Watch is gonna be a big part.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:27.360]  I think it's just almost, it's almost mind boggling to me
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.160]  how little speculation there is about Apple Watch 2
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.380]  in this week's event compared to the iPhone.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.960]  Whereas I think it's gonna be comparable to two years ago
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.160]  where it's a huge, huge part of the announcement.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.500]  Yeah, I think in some ways,
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:44.760]  watchOS 3 was so great that it took some of the pressure
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.680]  off of Apple Watch 2 because it makes it so much faster
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.200]  and it makes it so much more coherent.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.640]  And if we hadn't gotten that,
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.080]  people would be desperate for an upgrade
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.380]  just to get more speeds and feeds
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.080]  behind the existing software.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.440]  But because Apple Watch 3 pairs things down
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.520]  and makes it work much better,
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.820]  I've been using it since WWDC and it's just, it's so good.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.320]  I was actually wondering if it would give them
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.220]  an extra six months before they had to push out
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.160]  new hardware.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.800]  I started using it in, I think, in mid-July.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.000]  I was traveling too much in early July.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  And you had to do it with your phone too.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.060]  You had to take your phone to iOS, the iOS 10 beta,
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.540]  and the watch, you had to go both.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.240]  So I waited a little bit, but I've been using it since July
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.680]  and it is exactly as promised.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.080]  It is every bit as much faster and more responsive
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.680]  as Apple promised.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.280]  Yeah, and that whole Friends Hub just bare,
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.960]  I mean, it is such a better experience.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.680]  Yeah, yeah, it really is.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.760]  So we'll see, I don't know.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.200]  So I think people who just keep it,
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.880]  and there was also a rumor about them
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.280]  keeping the first generation Apple Watch
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.560]  much as they've done with iPhones
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.300]  and knocking some of the price off
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.520]  to make a lower point of entry.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.200]  And I think Apple Watch 3 allows that
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.720]  to be a better experience too.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.400]  They could credibly do that
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.480]  and have an entry-level Apple Watch if they wanted to.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.200]  I wonder how they would do that.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.080]  I mean, maybe the answer is just as simple as,
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.240]  who cares if they look the same?
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.640]  But I don't know, would there be any other way,
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.160]  maybe new finishes or a new gold,
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.800]  different anodized colors for the new one,
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.600]  something so that they're visually different, I don't know.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.240]  Or maybe there's only one color option
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.560]  for the Apple Watch 1 that remains around.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.000]  And iPads have looked the same for a long,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.520]  like once in a while there's a physical difference
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.800]  like the touch ID sensor, or now they have the new sizes,
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.220]  but for a while the iPad mini has all looked the same
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.040]  and the iPad's air were marginally different.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.320]  Yeah, but I think that's where the jewelry aspect comes in,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.760]  where you can't, you know, if it costs $100 more,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.400]  you want it to look like $100 more.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.000]  $100 more, absolutely.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.800]  So I don't know, we'll have to see.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.280]  Let me take one more break
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.960]  and thank our third and final sponsor
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.040]  and we can finish up with whatever else
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:43.880]  we want to talk about.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.640]  It's our good friends at Automattic.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.320]  Automattic is the small adapter that turns your car,
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.880]  even if it's an old clunker, into a smart, connected car.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:58.120]  There's a port, there's a diagnostic port on every car
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.960]  that's been made since like 1997,
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.640]  so it's not even that new.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.680]  This is what, when you go to the mechanic,
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.720]  you go to the auto shop, they plug into
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.080]  to get readings from the car.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.400]  It has all sorts of information.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.240]  Anything your car knows about
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.620]  goes through this diagnostic port.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.760]  Well, you plug your Automattic in there
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.920]  and you get access to all this information.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.860]  How do you interface it?
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:21.780]  Yeah, they have a great app for your iPhone
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.520]  that connects to your Automattic.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.000]  You get information on your driving efficiency.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.820]  You get information on where you park your car.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:31.840]  You get information on what's wrong with your car,
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.840]  if anything's wrong.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.280]  Really great stuff.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.640]  I've had one for a while.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.480]  I love it.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.300]  It could not be easier.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.200]  You don't even have to think about it
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.560]  until you want to know information from your car,
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.680]  but Automattic has just launched a brand new product.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.840]  It's a better version.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.600]  It's called the Automattic Pro
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.600]  and now it comes with unlimited 3G wireless networking
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.920]  with no monthly fees or subscription.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.880]  So it's sort of like a Kindle in that regard
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.480]  where the dingus that you plug in has 3G networking,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.520]  but you don't have to pay for it.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.120]  You don't pay a carrier, any kind of thing like that.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.760]  All you do is buy the Automattic.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.120]  You buy it, you own it.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.440]  There's no monthly fee to Automattic,
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.160]  no monthly fee to a carrier.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.760]  And always their 3G lets you know things
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.640]  like where your car is parked at any time,
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.600]  even if you're not the one who parked it.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.520]  So like if somebody, your spouse,
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.320]  your significant other parked the car
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.160]  and you don't know where it is
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.000]  and your phone wasn't there when you parked the car,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.440]  because it has 3G networking, you just open up the app
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.520]  and it'll tell you exactly where the car is.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.840]  They have all sorts of integration.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.680]  The canonical one is they connect to IFTTT,
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.600]  if this, then that,
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.480]  and you can do all sorts of customization
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.680]  like link your car to connected devices
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.160]  like a Nest Thermostat or Amazon Echo.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.240]  So you can ask Alexa, where'd I park my car?
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.800]  And she will tell you.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.080]  You can have it set up so that your Nest
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.640]  will adjust the temperature of your home
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.120]  when you get within a certain number of miles of the house.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.280]  And in an emergency, you can even do things,
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.920]  it'll even do things like detect a severe accident.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.080]  Hope you never need it, but it's there if you do.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:12.920]  And contact 911 or whatever the trained responders are
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920]  where you live to help you
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.280]  when you can't call for help yourself.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.640]  Now, the automatic is normally $129.95,
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.640]  but when you use this exclusive offer, talk show,
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.680]  just plain old talk show, it's for listeners of this show,
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.440]  you will save 20 bucks on your purchase.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.880]  Just go to automatic.com slash talk show
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.560]  for more information and use that code talk show
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.200]  and you'll save 20 bucks
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.800]  on the already regularly low price of automatic.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.320]  And again, once you buy it and you own it,
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.480]  it is yours and you get to just keep using it
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.400]  and there's no service fees.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.880]  Could not be easier, could not be a better deal.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.720]  Really a lot of fun.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.320]  So my thanks to automatic
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.120]  for once again sponsoring this show.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.080]  What else is going on?
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.720]  Galaxy S7, sorry, Galaxy Note 7 recalls.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.800]  That's been all over the news.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.280]  That is all over the news.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.280]  Doesn't sound good.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.200]  No, it's something with the power cells
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.200]  that's causing overheating and or combustion.
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.800]  And I think it was something like 45 units were affected,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.360]  but they did a global recall.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.200]  Yeah, did they do a recall though?
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.800]  Cause I just saw a story that Consumer Reports,
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.160]  the headline from Consumer Reports is
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.880]  instead of offering to replace units,
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.560]  Samsung sort of officially recall Note 7
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.680]  via US Consumer Product Safety Commission
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.120]  making sales of pre-recall units illegal.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.880]  Yeah, so there's a distinction that they,
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.640]  this is basically Samsung doing their own thing
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.680]  where they globally announced
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.720]  that they're gonna take these back
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.760]  and replace them with improved units.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.920]  And that's different than having
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.320]  an official US government recall
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.680]  where it does make them illegal
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.320]  and there's sort of a process in place.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.440]  So they would have to do that
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.280]  on a country by country basis too.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.720]  Yeah, bad timing too,
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.720]  cause it's right up in front of the iPhone event.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.040]  And I can't help to point out
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.920]  that as much as Samsung is certainly Apple's biggest rival
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.240]  in this game, easily, by far and away, by most accounts,
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.080]  still the only two companies in the market
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.880]  who are really making profits on smartphones,
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.480]  it just goes to show how much less of a deal
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.920]  Samsung is than Apple.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.520]  Because if the iPhone 7 were getting a recall
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.920]  three weeks after it came out, this-
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.720]  The world would stop.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.960]  For as much as in tech circles, this is a story,
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.240]  the iPhone thing would be like front page news.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.600]  That would be like front page
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.400]  of the New York Times style news.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.640]  Yeah, I went into Google Trends and just put
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.120]  Galaxy recall and iPhone recall in there for fun.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.560]  And even though there has never been an iPhone recall,
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.120]  not once, there are the spikes,
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.240]  the yearly spike over whatever gate there is,
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.800]  whether it's Bendgate or Chipgate,
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.160]  are far higher than the Google Trends
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.120]  for an actual Samsung recall.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.400]  Right, that's a good example.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.280]  So like Bendgate was, got more,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.920]  created more controversy, was more hyped than,
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.640]  which was a problem, a real problem.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.760]  I mean, if your phone bent, you know, it's a real problem.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.480]  But I mean, it didn't even necessitate a product recall.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:20.120]  Then Samsung phones that actually explode.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.000]  And the other thing that, you know,
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.440]  Samsung is not my favorite company for a variety of reasons,
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.800]  mostly having to do with how Samsung has treated people
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.160]  that I know who've worked there.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.600]  But they make a lot of the components
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.120]  that go into iPhones too,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.760]  and they make a lot of batteries for both iPhones
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.600]  and a lot of Apple products and a lot of other products.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.200]  And if they have a problem with the batteries
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.160]  they're making for themselves,
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.320]  it just means that everybody, every vendor,
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.880]  everyone who's buying from Samsung
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.840]  has to be incredibly careful going forward too.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.120]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.480]  It's bad news.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.920]  I wonder how they're, you know,
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.800]  I wonder how big of a financial hit this is.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.080]  If they- Yeah.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.200]  Rumors are that they've already sold about 2.5 million.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.520]  And so if you figure, what are they?
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.040]  Are they six or $700 phones?
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.760]  They're like $800, $850 phones.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.160]  I think they're super expensive.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.360]  But who knows what the cost is to them
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.120]  for replacing them for everybody?
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.480]  Yeah, their bill of materials is probably not insignificant.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.320]  Hmm.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.400]  I don't get it.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.480]  And like you said, really bad timing.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.280]  And this, it's arguable now,
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.320]  whether the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S is their flagship
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.160]  or the Galaxy Note,
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.600]  just because the Galaxy Note is such a distinct product
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.800]  because it does have that pen
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.160]  and it does have, you know,
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.160]  sort of the upper end of all the features
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.400]  that they put into phones.
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.480]  It does sound like the good news is,
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.360]  again, at least in terms of personal safety wise,
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.760]  that the phone tends, the problem where it melts
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.200]  or explodes, whatever you want to call it,
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.480]  burst into flames, happens while it's charging.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.320]  Yeah.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.080]  And I mean, that's good news in terms of,
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.040]  it's better than if it happened when it was in your pocket.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.600]  I'm not even joking around.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.720]  I mean, but it's, you know,
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.840]  it is obviously a fire hazard that if, you know,
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.680]  I wonder, I don't know,
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.040]  I would have to think that it's better
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.720]  to have it happen when it charges,
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.560]  but a lot of times your phone charges
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.800]  while, you know, you're not paying attention to it.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800]  So it's, I know I'm wrapping up a lot of things here,
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.080]  but it's sort of, I don't wish ill on any manufacturer
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.080]  or any customer, you know,
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.880]  I want everyone to have great products
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.720]  and you never kick somebody when they're down,
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.480]  but it reminded me of how much armchair product management
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.600]  Apple has to put up with.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.120]  Like Apple did not switch to USB-C
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.480]  and they were castigated for it.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.360]  And we watched those keynotes from Google IO
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.280]  and from Facebook and everyone said,
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.200]  Apple's so behind on this or that,
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200]  or they don't have, you know,
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.600]  where's Apple's modular phones,
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.480]  both Motorola and Google are way ahead.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.080]  And then this week we also saw
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.000]  the cancellation of Project Aura.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.640]  And it's impressive how much the tech industry
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.520]  holds Apple's shipping products
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.720]  against the imaginary products of their competitors.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.560]  Yeah, totally.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.920]  And that's a good way to put it.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.520]  I mean, I think the McElope made that case
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.360]  the first that I can remember.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.800]  And it's as true today as it's ever been.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.600]  I remember CES a long time ago,
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.600]  maybe 10, 15 years ago,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.120]  because Bill Gates was still presenting
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.920]  where he walked around with his Windows mobile phone
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.560]  and how it would seamlessly integrate
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.760]  with his personal computer
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:11.200]  and everything else in his environment, his living room.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.200]  And that was the subject of his keynote
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.960]  and Microsoft never, not ever shipped that.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.600]  And yet we have companies like Apple
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.080]  who've pushed out continuity
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.680]  and are increasingly making these things,
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.640]  but it's 10 or 12 years later.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.760]  And every time someone does a keynote,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.800]  they're seen as behind,
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.560]  they're seen as beleaguered or doomed
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.400]  and they just keep shipping products.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.640]  And I tried, I didn't have much time to speak in,
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.800]  but I tried to go back and look at different Google IOs
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.640]  and different manufacturers' keynotes
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.920]  to see the products they announced
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.040]  and try to figure out which ones of them
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.400]  either ever shipped or is still on the market.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.400]  And the list was getting too big, I had to stop.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:49.400]  I don't know what, it's like,
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.080]  I guess the advantage for Samsung compared to Apple,
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.400]  I mean, it's not just that they don't sell
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.680]  as many of their highest end phones as Apple sells
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.120]  if it's highest end phones,
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.040]  but that they do spread their chips around
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.000]  on a couple more bets by having,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.800]  a couple of quote unquote flagship phones per year,
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.440]  whereas Apple puts all of their eggs in one basket
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.840]  with the iPhone 7.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.440]  Yeah, it's almost as if Apple shipped the iPhone 6S
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.640]  in the spring and the iPhone 6S Plus in the fall.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.440]  Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440]  And it's obviously,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.200]  a one time that ever actually did happen,
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.280]  I would say it would be with the Verizon iPhone 4.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.440]  Was it 4 or 4S?
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.280]  I think it was Verizon.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.120]  Verizon iPhone 4, yeah.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.000]  And then the SE this year, they did a spring launch.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.320]  Right, so they got to do one in January
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.840]  for Verizon and CDMA networks around the world
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.000]  where they fixed the antenna lines a little bit
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:40.960]  and stuff like that.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.200]  But for the most part, Apple's,
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.400]  all of our phone eggs are in one basket company.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.520]  So a recall like this for Apple would be,
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.000]  really, I mean, it would warrant the controversy
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.120]  that things like Ben Gate and whatever.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.560]  Like Chip Gate.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.360]  Right, Chip Gate and Tennegate have gotten.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.880]  It would actually warrant the hysteria.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.800]  So who knows what the level of hysteria would actually be?
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:03.920]  It would probably be.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.240]  And you know, like chipping the iPhone is non-trivial.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.880]  The same way that booting up Windows
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.440]  and all the disparate hardware every day is non-trivial
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.720]  and getting all those pieces.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.440]  And we've seen, you know,
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.080]  we're probably not getting MacBooks this week
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.200]  because it is so hard to line up all of that stuff
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.680]  to arrive at one time.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.120]  And kudos to those teams for getting that iPhone out
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.720]  all the time like clockwork.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.920]  Well, that's my question though.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.800]  So a couple of people have suggested that.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.360]  I think Mark Gurman said that people, you know,
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:37.720]  had had some information on upcoming new MacBooks
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.640]  and said that they're not expected
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.080]  to be announced at this event.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.360]  Who else said that?
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.680]  Somebody else has said that.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.000]  I wasn't, I mean, Apple's never announced MacBooks
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.760]  alongside, and you never say never
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.280]  because they can change their minds anytime they want,
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.200]  but they've just never put a Mac on the same stage
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.040]  as an iPhone that I can remember.
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.920]  But my comparison would be the last year though,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.200]  they didn't hesitate to put the iPad Pro on stage
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.400]  next to the new iPhone,
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.520]  which was, you know, the original first iPad Pro.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.480]  Yeah, and the Apple TV and the new watch bands,
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.320]  but that's not big.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.160]  Yeah, well, the watch bands
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.040]  was sort of a little bonus thing,
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.320]  but there were three products all announced.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.120]  You know, it was the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.680]  Then they had a whole segment on the iPad Pro
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.960]  and the pencil and all the software
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.800]  that, you know, was already on day one,
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.880]  or that they secretly brought people in,
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.680]  you know, to create apps to support,
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.160]  and the new Apple TV.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.520]  I don't know that there's, to me, that in my gut,
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.200]  I don't, there's nothing special about the Mac
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:43.000]  that would prevent it from being on stage with the iPhone.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.400]  No, I mean, there might be other reasons,
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.800]  but I don't think that's it.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.200]  Yeah, and the other question is just timing.
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.160]  I mean, like, the same way the desire, I believe,
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.000]  was to ship Apple TV last WWDC,
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.960]  and it ends up going in the fall instead.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.040]  I think the desire this year was to ship at WWDC,
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.080]  and it just, they didn't have, whether it's Intel or AMD
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:01.440]  or one of the customizations they're working on.
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:04.680]  Actually, I think this really is a MacBook Pro upgrade.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.520]  This isn't just bumping it to Skylake
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.640]  or, you know, maybe Kaby Lake at some point,
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:12.440]  because every, it's, there's no sexiness in that anymore.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.800]  It's not a great product.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.880]  It's just a spec bump, and they could do that
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:17.080]  as soon as the chips are ready,
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.640]  and they really wanna do something more,
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.200]  because everyone has copied their design.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.080]  Everyone is sort of making ultrabooks
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:24.200]  and laptops that look like MacBooks,
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.480]  and they really wanna push the boundaries again
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.600]  of what we think is possible,
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.760]  and that does involve things like the OLED strip
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.760]  and other new advances.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.200]  Yeah, so, I mean, there's so much, you know,
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.680]  enough smoke that I guess there's a fire,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.200]  or I guess there's no smoke, so there's no fire
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.000]  that there won't be any Mac announcements this week,
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.600]  which means it will, but they're, you know,
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.960]  if they're coming this year,
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:54.080]  it's either going to be another smaller event in October,
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:58.240]  or they'll just do it by inviting people
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.120]  to private briefings.
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.040]  They, as much as we want new MacBooks,
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.800]  Apple really wants new MacBook Pros.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.840]  Apple Retail really, I mean,
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.680]  they set out the back-to-school season,
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.440]  and they would not do that lightly.
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.640]  That is not an easy, it's like the same thing
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.040]  with last year, where they didn't have keyboards
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.520]  and pencils to sell when the iPad Pro went on sale.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.080]  That's a huge loss for them as a retail operation,
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.960]  and not having brand new MacBook Pros on the market
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.680]  or updated MacBook Airs to give them a huge bump
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.800]  in the back-to-school season
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.320]  or going into the holiday sales is a huge thing for them.
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:27.960]  They really want those things to ship,
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.200]  so it's not like Apple's just sitting on their hands
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:34.200]  and withholding MacBook Pros and Airs to be mean to us.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.600]  Right, so apparently, so Gurman says
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.280]  that there's gonna be new MacBook Airs with USB-C.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.120]  No other details that I noticed in his report.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.400]  I will still hold on to my wager
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.920]  that they will never get Retina displays.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.040]  Yeah, I think the goal is that the MacBook replaces them.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.600]  It's just, it's not there from a price point,
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.000]  because again, Apple is a financial company
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.600]  as much as it is a computing company,
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.960]  and $899 and $999 are incredibly compelling price points,
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.400]  and we used to have the plastic
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.960]  and then the original aluminum MacBook at that point,
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.080]  and those got replaced by the MacBook Air,
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:08.720]  and until something can replace those,
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:09.960]  they're not gonna go anywhere.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.040]  They still have that CD-ROM MacBook Pro.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.320]  For God's sakes.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.600]  Yeah, I, what is that thing called?
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.400]  The 13-inch MacBook Pro with the...
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.000]  Yeah, with an optical drive or a super drive or something.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.200]  But that's sort of what I expected them to do with the Air,
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.120]  is what they did with that MacBook Pro,
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.360]  which is not even updated, not even,
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.040]  it's just the exact same device that it was
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.720]  three or four years ago when it was new, that it is now,
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.960]  and I just sort of thought that
[01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.240]  that's what they would do with the Air,
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.080]  but it sounds like they're gonna do some modest speed bump,
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:43.520]  speed bump, and I guess that makes some amount of sense
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.640]  because that 13-inch MacBook Pro with the optical drive
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.600]  is a real niche.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.800]  I mean, they don't even have that out on the desks.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.800]  Oh, you have to look on the website even to find it.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.840]  Right, so you have to know that it exists and ask for it,
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.480]  and you have, whatever reason you want that device,
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.760]  you have very specific reasons for it.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:08.400]  Whereas the, I guess the sense of doing a modest update
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.040]  to the Air is that the Airs are still a top-selling,
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.720]  probably the top-selling models of MacBooks in the stores,
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.920]  and it's therefore too important,
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.680]  just from a financial standpoint,
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.000]  to really let them stagnate too much.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.160]  Yeah, it's the 13-inch MacBook Air.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.080]  My understanding is that's just the go-to computer,
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:30.480]  and if technology wasn't moving as fast, that'd be fine,
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.760]  but we are getting new connectors,
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.400]  and there are all sorts of things that,
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.560]  especially if maybe Apple does have other accessories
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.960]  in the wings that'll depend on having
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.520]  those kind of interconnects,
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.720]  it'll behoove them to have that on the market.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.480]  And then Retina is a big differentiator,
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.520]  Retina and just the size and the colors of the MacBook
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.880]  to sort of justify that next generation
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:49.840]  staying on the market.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.360]  Yeah, and if they start pushing out USB-C ports
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.320]  on MacBooks, and presumably,
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.920]  I guess they'd put them in the iMac too,
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.280]  do they switch the Lightning cable
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.720]  that comes with the iOS devices from USB-C to Lightning?
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.720]  Because for example, right now,
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.760]  if you want to charge your iPhone from your MacBook,
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:15.760]  your one-port MacBook, you still need a dongle,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.160]  because your cable that comes with your iPhone
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.960]  is the big, fat USB.
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.360]  What is that, USB?
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.960]  Yeah, don't they have that for the 12.9-inch NitroPod Pro?
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.680]  They do have a Lightning to USB-C cable now,
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.600]  because that's what does the USB-C faster
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.960]  or the better charging on the 12.9-inch.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.800]  I think so, yeah.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.240]  Yeah, so I think they have that cable now,
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.440]  so it's just that people have to go out and buy that cable.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.120]  Yeah, but I think maybe,
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.160]  I wonder if they start shipping it in the box.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.440]  Yeah, that'd be nice.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.640]  It's such a mess, when you look at those chipsets,
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.080]  and when you look at the trouble Microsoft had
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.000]  with Skylake in the early Surface books,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.080]  and even Paul Thoreau lost it several times
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:56.720]  trying to deal with those machines,
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.280]  and then Intel just kept pushing things back.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.240]  I think DisplayPort, the new one
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.360]  that everyone's been waiting for,
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.800]  got pushed back to Cannon Lake,
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.080]  and now, sorry, got pushed back to KB Lake,
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.440]  and now it's pushed back to Cannon Lake,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.400]  and now pushed back beyond Cannon Lake.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.520]  It's just that kind of, they're so dependent
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.440]  on the silicon of other companies right now
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.680]  for their Mac line.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.520]  Yeah.
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:20.880]  It does seem weird, though.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.120]  It really, and I guess part of it is that,
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.480]  part of the reason that I'm so antsy
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.280]  about them not announcing Mac stuff in September
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.400]  is just that it just feels so overdue at this point.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.240]  Yeah.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.640]  Like, I was mildly surprised when word leaked
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.600]  that there wasn't gonna be new MacBook Pros at WWDC,
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.280]  because I think a lot of us earlier in the year
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.080]  were expecting that, and it seemed a little surprising
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:43.920]  at the time.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:44.760]  I think Apple was expecting it, too.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.440]  But I do, too, but I really underestimated
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.680]  at the time in June just how long the summer
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.400]  was gonna feel without new MacBook Pros.
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:56.480]  It just seemed at the time, like in June,
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.080]  it seemed like, ah, it'll be September before you know it,
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.840]  whereas now it feels like, man, these computers
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.560]  that they're selling are ridiculous.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:05.360]  I don't know about you, but I don't feel as much pressure.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.160]  Like, I have a review unit for the latest generation
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.800]  13-inch MacBook Pro with the Force Touch trackpad,
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.040]  and I think it's Broadwell inside it.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.160]  But I still use my previous, the one that my personal one,
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.560]  it's a previous generation with the old-fashioned trackpad.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.440]  I actually like the Force Touch trackpad better,
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.080]  but I just didn't wanna go through the rigmarole
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.480]  of setting up the new MacBook, so I'm still using my one
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:26.160]  from a couple of years ago, and I'm fine.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.320]  I have the exact same one, and I agree it's fine,
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.760]  but it's, and I probably won't buy the new one personally,
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.080]  just because I tend to buy a MacBook Pro
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.880]  and then run it into the ground,
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.600]  just because it takes me like a whole week
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.160]  to set it up the way I like it.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.080]  And honestly, I don't do anything
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:47.640]  that is performance-intensive on the MacBook Pro,
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.680]  so I'm fine.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.400]  If it was just Skylake or Kaby Lake,
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.440]  I would probably wait it out too,
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.680]  but I'm just gonna be super interested
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.080]  in using those new features.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.800]  I'm gonna get one.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.120]  The fact that they're so long in the tooth, though,
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.600]  as, I just hear it, I'm sure you do too,
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.880]  but on Twitter and on email all the time,
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.000]  all the obvious problems that this creates
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.440]  is that the people who listen to us on podcasts
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:14.280]  or read iMore and Daring Fireball are savvy people,
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  and so they know that these machines are old,
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.800]  and so I just keep hearing from people
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.240]  who really need a new machine.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.480]  I mean, either that they have something really, really old
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.880]  and that they were putting it off,
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.880]  they just picked the wrong year to put it off for,
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:31.320]  or they have a machine that is broken
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.880]  or started a new job, and they get a MacBook.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.000]  And guess what?
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.160]  Who wants to start a job now,
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.960]  and your MacBook that you get from your employer
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:42.160]  is, you already know in your heart,
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.160]  is going to be outdated really momentarily.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.520]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.680]  And it reminds me sort of of 2011
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.720]  where we got used to having new iPhones at WWDC,
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.040]  and then a couple months out
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.080]  that was don't expect any new hardware,
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.640]  and then we waited, and it wasn't September,
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.800]  it ended up being October before the iPhone 4S came out,
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.520]  and we could say that was iCloud or Siri or whatever
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.200]  that took that much time to get ready,
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.680]  but you're still waiting a much longer,
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.120]  it was 16 months instead of 12,
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.960]  and this is even longer than that.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.880]  And again, it was up to Apple.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:17.520]  I'm sure they would have shipped it way, way earlier, but.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.720]  Something happened.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.240]  Yeah, and I don't know what you do as a company
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:22.640]  because externally, Apple is not a communicative company.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.480]  There are a lot of companies
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:24.840]  that would have announced the product
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.320]  months before it was ready, and teased it,
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.200]  and shown it off on stage,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.800]  and then issued delay after delay,
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.000]  and sort of tried to explain it,
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.640]  maybe did a good job, maybe not,
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.440]  but Apple just stays absolutely quiet about these things,
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:37.640]  and sometimes when it's like this,
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.520]  it's just a deathly silence.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:41.240]  Yeah, so we'll have to see.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:45.660]  Can't help it then too, hopefully, new Mac Pros.
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:47.800]  I mean, that's the one that to me is less,
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.640]  like people will accuse us always
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.180]  of making excuses for Apple,
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.460]  but the Mac, you could even say the Mac Pro,
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.660]  they're waiting for Skylake Xion or whatever,
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:57.400]  but those graphics cards could have been updated
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.480]  so many times, especially for people,
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.320]  because the Mac Pro is a performance machine,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.620]  and if you're gonna bind it with graphics cards
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.880]  that you can't swap out, I think it's sort of incumbent
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.920]  on you to issue timely updates for them.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920]  Yeah, it really, and again,
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:14.120]  it's the sort of thing that they seemingly could have done.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.360]  They don't need to do it at an event,
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.360]  just silent, not even silent, but like press release,
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:24.240]  like hey, remember that Mac Pro we released a year ago?
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.520]  Here's the same thing,
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.160]  but with a year better graphics card.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.200]  Absolutely, and even if there's a reason,
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.940]  we don't want Broadwell Xion for some reason,
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:33.960]  don't say just put out the better graphics cards.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.800]  Yeah, and it really works against Apple's style of pricing,
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.400]  where Apple doesn't really price things
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.560]  like a tech company does based on the components.
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.000]  The price is part of the brand,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.960]  and so the three-year-old Mac Pro
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.200]  still sells for the same price
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.440]  that sold that three years ago,
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.160]  whereas if it was Dell and you were buying a machine
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.640]  that had a three-year-old CPU
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:56.840]  and a three-year-old graphics card,
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.720]  you'd be getting a much lower price on it.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.840]  Absolutely, and again, if you're gonna say
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.120]  the future of computing is computing appliances,
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.520]  then you have to keep it updated,
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.840]  especially when it is like the Lamborghini
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.640]  or Veyron of your line.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.720]  Right, and I understand why Apple does that,
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.640]  and I'm not saying that they should be lowering the price
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:13.960]  on the Mac Pro, I'm saying though
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.980]  that if you're going to maintain these prices
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:16.820]  that you don't lower them,
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.880]  you've gotta keep it updated to some degree
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.080]  on an annual basis to justify it,
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.680]  because the reason Apple doesn't lower the price
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.340]  is that when they do release a new one,
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.280]  they wanna release it at the exact same price
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.880]  and not have it suddenly look like it jumped in price
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:30.660]  by two or $3,000.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:32.200]  And Mac Mini, I think, is the same story.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.680]  They never updated the Mac Mini on a year-over-year basis,
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.320]  but it's been, I think, two years at the most,
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.040]  and now we're hitting close to three,
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.520]  and they've made that an appliance too
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.800]  where it's very hard to update,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.360]  so fine, do that, but that means you're agreeing
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.300]  to the responsibility of updating it for me.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.840]  Right, I don't know, I feel like the Mac Mini,
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.880]  they should call it the Mac we don't want you to buy.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.760]  The legacy.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.400]  Right, but the people who love them love them so much.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.000]  Absolutely, and they're great machines,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.400]  but they got rid of the quad core,
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.520]  and they've sealed them up,
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:01.120]  and they now have to update them.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.560]  Right, so I don't know, what do you think?
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.480]  Do you think they're gonna have an event,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.200]  or do you think they're going to do briefings?
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.400]  You know, in the old days,
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.520]  if they hadn't been working on AC2,
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:11.960]  they would've just done a town hall
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:14.360]  that they did with previous years with new Macs
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.920]  and sometimes new iPads as well,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.400]  but they sort of made it sound like the last,
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.000]  like the iPhone SE event was the last time
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.400]  they'd be using town hall,
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.020]  and I don't think the new campus is ready for anything,
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:27.200]  so I think your idea of briefings makes the most sense.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.340]  I mean, they could always go back on it
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:29.480]  and invite people to town hall.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.920]  Yeah, Jason Snell pointed out that Tim Cook even,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:32.820]  I've forgotten about that,
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:35.400]  but Tim Cook pointed out during that iPhone SE event
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.440]  that this would probably be the last event.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.000]  We've had a lot of history here in this room,
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.540]  and this would probably be the last time,
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:44.200]  but my thinking is that maybe at that time
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.080]  they were totally expecting to have this Mac stuff
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.320]  ready to go WWDC.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.140]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.560]  And so maybe, you know,
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.460]  maybe we do get a one last,
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.280]  one more thing event at town hall.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.320]  And as much as it's a pain
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.360]  to have to do a second event in the fall,
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.520]  it would be just as much of a pain
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.960]  to do a traveling road show.
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.320]  At least I don't have to do it,
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.960]  so I start reaction and say how much it is.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.880]  You know what I think it is?
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.360]  I think that it's a different,
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.600]  it's a problem for a different set of people at Apple.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:13.960]  The people who set up these big mega events
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.280]  and really, you know, quite frankly,
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:17.720]  told, you know, point blank,
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:20.120]  said last year, doing two, even a smaller one,
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.500]  it's so much less work.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.400]  Like, doing one event is so much better.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.520]  It's a different group of people
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:27.920]  who would have to do double the work or extra work.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.760]  Yeah, the events team does the onsite,
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.240]  and it's mostly the marketing and the PR team
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.640]  that does the road shows.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:35.480]  But one way or the other,
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.320]  it seems like something's gonna happen.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.600]  All right, here's the other, the last thing.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.820]  Here's the last thing I think about this event.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.280]  If it's true that there are no Mac announcements
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.280]  at this event,
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.880]  well then the only thing we know
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.600]  is iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.400]  I don't think they're gonna do an update to the iPad Pro.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.320]  The only thing I could see is giving the 12.9
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.700]  the same sort of, so there's two disparities now,
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.480]  and I always think sometimes the ID department
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.160]  is trolling us because the 12.9-inch iPad
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.820]  has the USB 3 controller,
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.880]  so it has much faster speeds and it charges faster.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.520]  The Baby Pro has the DCI-P3 display and the True Tone
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.960]  and the better camera.
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.040]  And in a perfect world, those were sort of even out
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.400]  and we get a minor bump.
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.760]  And also the A10, I mean, I don't need it,
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.040]  but I'd want both those machines
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.320]  to have the A10 or the A10X processor.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.960]  Yeah, so I don't know.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.900]  We haven't heard anything, but I could believe it,
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.120]  but I could also believe that maybe it's,
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:33.340]  the iPad is on the March cycle,
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:36.400]  and that the iPad, that 12.9-inch iPad Pro
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.400]  will be, you know, like this one time on an 18-month cycle
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.780]  and an 18-month cycle instead of a 12-month cycle.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:44.620]  Just to get-
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:46.140]  On one hand, Phil Schiller could do that magic thing
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:47.820]  where he just has one slide that goes up and,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.900]  oh, by the way, new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with True Tone,
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.860]  also available shipping this month.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.700]  Yeah.
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.520]  But it does make sense to have,
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.660]  if they stick with the March event,
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.060]  which I think makes sense for them,
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:00.220]  because it's really long to go without product launches
[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:01.940]  until dub-dub or September.
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:04.200]  Right, I could see them doing a minor upgrade to it, though,
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.420]  where maybe they don't even upgrade the A9X
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:10.780]  and just upgrade the display to get True Tone.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.420]  I could see that.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.540]  But I don't see it, if they do that,
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.020]  it's certainly not gonna take a lot of time on stage.
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:20.660]  And so I think it's a relatively short event.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:21.500]  I don't think you could say
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.380]  that the max stuff is forced out by time.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.620]  I just don't, you know,
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.540]  and it makes me wonder whether there is something else
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:29.700]  that, you know, a true surprise.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.900]  I'm not trying to be a tease here.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.740]  I'm not trying to set people's expectations too high,
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.380]  but it makes me wonder whether there's something else
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.300]  that they're planning to use this event for
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.660]  that is, you know, totally out of the blue.
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.460]  Yeah, some of the S events, the iPhone S events,
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.380]  have been small, and they've been okay with that.
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.300]  I think the 4S and 5S events were relatively small,
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:50.660]  and they were absolutely fine with that.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.020]  The biggest surprises they've had lately
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.120]  are things that just can't leak,
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.620]  things like ResearchKit and CareKit,
[01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:55.820]  which are just, you know,
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:57.980]  they're so far in the engineering organization,
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:00.880]  they have such a small visibility that they don't get out.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.260]  But those aren't the kind of surprises
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:04.580]  that consumers usually care about.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.880]  Yeah, when was Apple Pay?
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.100]  That was two years ago, right?
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:10.820]  That was the event with the original Apple Watch.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.180]  iPhone 6 event, yeah.
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:16.260]  Right, and that was held in, where was it?
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:17.100]  Flint Center.
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.060]  Yeah, the Flint Center, right, right.
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.700]  I don't know.
[01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:23.620]  And Apple TV, I mean,
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:25.780]  they've never updated Apple TV year over year either,
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.780]  and they could put a better,
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.940]  I mean, the obvious upgrade there is 4K
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.180]  and the higher color gamut as well, but.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:34.380]  And an asymmetrical remote.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:36.500]  Yeah, an asymmetrical, absolutely.
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.060]  But I think there's a new team on the remote,
[01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.660]  so maybe we'll get that eventually.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.660]  Yeah, I'm not expecting that, though.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:42.900]  I do expect, you know,
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:45.160]  obviously someday we'll have another Apple TV.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.800]  I do expect that maybe the next time
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.380]  they'll make that remote a better design.
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:50.340]  Yeah.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.640]  I don't expect it this year.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.420]  And even if they did, I don't think it's gonna take,
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.740]  I don't think it takes a lot of time on stage,
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.260]  because, you know, the things they might introduce,
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:02.540]  like a better, you know, faster CPU, that's not a doubt.
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.360]  It would be the iTunes 4K part of that,
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.120]  that would be the stage time.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.100]  And I don't know if they have iTunes 4K ready.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.900]  Yeah, and I just don't see that enough people
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.800]  have 4K TVs that it's a big deal.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.540]  It's like, hey, you can buy this new Apple TV
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.980]  that drives a 4K TV that you don't own.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.300]  Well, it's not so much the, like last time
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:23.120]  we were together, they invited us over to Dolby,
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:24.560]  and I took the chance to go,
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.900]  and they showed us side by side 4K versus 1080p HDR
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.000]  for Star Wars, the new Star Wars movie,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.860]  and for the Revenant.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:36.060]  And the difference between the HDR
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.500]  and HDR was so much better than 4K.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:41.140]  If they just went to HDR across their pipeline,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.400]  I think that would be super impressive.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.620]  But again, those TV sets are super expensive
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:45.620]  and hard to come by.
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.620]  Anything else, anything else you wanna cover
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:53.420]  before we wrap this up and we pack our bags
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.540]  and get ready to go to this event?
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.140]  No, I mean, I think WWDC this year
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:47:01.020]  was almost a return to the very Spartan Apple keynotes.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.740]  You know, there weren't the big jokes,
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:04.860]  there weren't the big skits.
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:07.380]  It was a very matter-of-fact keynote presentation.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.500]  And I think if they stick to that for this,
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.700]  it'll especially be a very tight,
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.820]  I don't know if we'll get,
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:14.740]  we haven't gotten the updates on the Apple stores
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.020]  a lot recently, and we haven't gotten
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.980]  a lot of the business slides recently.
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.180]  It's been Tim Cook coming out
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.940]  and almost doing a smash cut
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.060]  right into the product announcements.
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:24.600]  And if that's sort of like the new way,
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.940]  or the return to the old way of the Apple keynotes,
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:31.240]  then it'll be a very efficient iPhone, Apple Watch,
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:33.620]  and we're out in the hands-on area.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.300]  I am trying to have it both ways.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:36.700]  I could see it going,
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:40.160]  I think the event is gonna go to one extreme or the other,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.540]  where it's either going to be like what you just said,
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:46.640]  a pretty bare-bones, maybe just 65 minutes.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.140]  You're almost out almost an hour after it starts,
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.840]  and it's just, hey, here's these two iPhones,
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.300]  two new iPhones that we expected,
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:58.660]  here's the new Apple Watch, and that's it.
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:47:59.500]  Or there's something else.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:00.660]  Do they use HomeKit for the home?
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:04.140]  So it's gonna be held at the Bill Graham Center again,
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.540]  and when they did the iPhone event last year,
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.540]  it was held at Bill Graham.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.900]  They didn't have very many people.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.460]  They famously couldn't get a lot of people in
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.820]  because of the fire marshals,
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:13.780]  but they had those giant living room sets
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.540]  with the Apple TVs for demos.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:17.500]  And then at WWDC, it was the opposite.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.440]  There were no demo areas,
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.860]  but they packed that place full of people.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:25.380]  And there's no developers this year to pack that place with,
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:27.460]  and we're not assuming there's gonna be any living room.
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:29.260]  So I wonder if maybe there's a HomeKit angle,
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:30.580]  they could be doing demos.
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.700]  I just don't know what the Bill Graham Center
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:33.540]  will be used for this year.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.700]  Right, I was told that they picked Bill Graham last year
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.660]  specifically to set up those living rooms
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:39.400]  for the Apple TVs, the fake living rooms
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.380]  for the Apple TVs, and that there was no other way
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.820]  that they could figure out how to have that many,
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:49.300]  that many hands-on areas for Apple TV.
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:50.700]  Yeah.
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:55.700]  Because the hands-on area for the phones and the watch
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.260]  and the iPad, it was nice, but it wasn't that big.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:02.500]  It was like a regular sort of piano bar setup.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.460]  Right, well, it almost looked like an Apple store,
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.180]  as I recall, but it wasn't that big,
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.140]  whereas they really used a huge chunk
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:14.620]  of physical real estate to set up those Apple TV demo areas.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.260]  Yeah, there was maybe 10 living rooms
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:18.960]  just completely set up that you could wander around.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:20.980]  So I wonder, I don't know, but on the other hand,
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:25.740]  maybe they just, until the campus is finished,
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.540]  this is just where they have these events,
[01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:30.420]  and they just like working with the Bill Graham people.
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.860]  I don't know.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:34.820]  I have a gut feeling, just anecdotally talking
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:37.180]  to other people in the racket,
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:40.220]  that it seems as though seating will be
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:41.740]  as tight as it was last year,
[01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:44.980]  that they were not especially particularly liberal
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:49.980]  with the passes for the media and whoever else they invite.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:53.420]  I have heard they are trying to do more international,
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.780]  which is one of the things that's putting pressure
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:56.540]  on US media, is that they want to get in people
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.300]  from Japan and from China and from Europe
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:01.100]  and actually bring them over and not just do remote setups.
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.260]  Right, no, I think that they're done
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:03.100]  with those remote setups.
[01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:04.460]  Like in the old days, for people who don't know
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:06.820]  what they used to do is they would have maybe,
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.820]  I think maybe one in Asia or two in Asia.
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.340]  I don't know if they did two, but at least one in Asia
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:13.940]  and then like in London or somewhere in Europe
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.220]  so that people who didn't want to travel
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.820]  all the way to California could just go there
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:20.060]  and they would have like these satellite events.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.460]  And did they do them like at the same time?
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:23.300]  Was it like?
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.140]  I think some were the same times and some they would do,
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.100]  they would have follow up, they would sort of send people
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:27.940]  out afterwards to follow up.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.420]  Right, I think the Asian ones
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:30.820]  would have to have been follow ups
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.560]  because like you could do the London one
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:37.420]  because 10 o'clock Pacific would be what?
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.740]  It would be noon, no, one o'clock Eastern
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:43.100]  and that means about six p.m. London,
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:45.900]  six or seven if I'm doing my math right,
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:46.940]  which is reasonable.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.900]  I mean, it's a little bit beyond for us
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:50.620]  because we're so used to going to these things
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.940]  in the morning, but you know, six or seven is reasonable.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:56.940]  But I think having them at like 2 a.m. would be,
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.420]  would be a little ridiculous.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:50:59.740]  And Apple is very clean with,
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.940]  like I've been following some of the other vendors now
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:02.780]  as they do their keynotes.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.060]  And for example, every year for Samsung,
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:07.180]  their keynote starts and their embargo drops
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:08.580]  the minute their keynote starts
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:09.900]  because they've invited people over
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:12.020]  to do hands-on weeks beforehand.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:13.260]  And then I'm watching the keynote
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:15.160]  and then all these YouTube videos go live
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.700]  that you can actually go see the product,
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.380]  which makes me not want to watch the keynote.
[01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.940]  And the timing for me is bizarre.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.280]  As just someone watching,
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.140]  I'd much rather enjoy the keynote
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.180]  and then have the embargo lift maybe after the keynote.
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:27.660]  So like the Apple one I actually prefer
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.580]  because there's sort of like this one unified thing
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.260]  to keep my attention on.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:32.300]  Yeah.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:33.140]  So I don't know.
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.500]  So I could see it going one way or the other,
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.540]  either very simple event, exactly as we predict
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:38.540]  where it's just the iPhone and Apple Watch 2,
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:41.300]  or there's something big that we,
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.420]  it's going to drop out of the blue.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:43.740]  Phil just drives it in the car.
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:44.900]  Just drives right in the car.
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:45.740]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:50.740]  That's it.
