[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Hey, John.
[00:02.000 --> 00:05.000]  MGC, where are you doing?
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.000]  Good. It's been a long time.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  I know, months.
[00:08.000 --> 00:14.000]  I feel like I strongly suspect that I would never be as
[00:14.000 --> 00:17.000]  industrious as to actually check, but I bet this is the longest
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.000]  stretch you've been without being on the show.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.000]  I think so.
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  I think that's right.
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  But you know, I live in London now, so that's part of the reason.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  Yeah, that is.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  It makes it a little bit harder to communicate.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  Yeah.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  It's funny, because it's going back to back.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000]  It's last episode was Ben Thompson, who's in Taipei.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  And now it's you in London.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000]  So I feel like I've gone around the world.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  And you've learned that it's international audience, hopefully.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  Yeah, I don't know that I honestly think it may be somebody in
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.000]  New Zealand or something could be further away.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  But that's about as far away as people can get.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  Well, this is much better.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.000]  Normally I have to talk to the West Coast, and that's eight hours.
[00:59.000 --> 01:02.000]  And so that keeps me up, you know, one a.m. to a.m.
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.000]  for those types of calls.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Yeah, I'll bet that that's actually pretty weird.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Because I do feel like being lifelong East Coast,
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  U.S. person, I feel like, you know, like Greenwich mean
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  time isn't that far away.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  But for someone from the West Coast, it truly is.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  It's an entire eight hours.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  We'll see how I'm going to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  I think it starts at like 12, 30 or so.
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  Maybe 11, 30 p.m.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.000]  And then it's going to go obviously to like 2, 30 a.m.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Obviously they have a lot of different bars and stuff set up
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.000]  over here to show it, but it will be weird.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  Because it's in Arizona, right?
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  So is that West Coast or is that it's either West or Mountain time?
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  But yeah.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Arizona is definitely West Coast time.
[01:48.000 --> 01:49.000]  I think.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  Definitely.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  Definitely.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  But isn't Arizona one of the, no, or is it New Mexico?
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  That's like one of the, like a holdout on.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  Yeah, one of those does not do it.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  And then Vegas does it weirdly.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  Like they sometimes are on one time zone,
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  sometimes on another or something like that.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  Yeah, well, they legislate it in Vegas
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  that there's no clocks anywhere.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  Right.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Like a lot of, you have to like hide your watch
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  when you get to the airport.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  They'll confiscate it.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  That's right.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.000]  So the big news this week.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  I feel like we have to talk about it and can't skip it
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  is the quarterly results from Apple.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  Yes.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  How do you miss that?
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  And it's like, I know I'm not a finance blogger.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  I try not to overemphasize it,
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  but I feel like in this case it's so outlandishly exceptional
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  that you can't help but talk about it
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  and write about it and will make links to it
[02:45.000 --> 02:46.000]  and stuff like that.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  I remember, I guess it was a couple of years ago,
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  probably when I was obviously still with,
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  maybe it was three years ago then when I was still with TechCrunch
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  and I was obviously doing a lot of the coverage
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  of the Apple earnings and each subsequent year
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  there would go up and up and up.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  And one of the years it was like insane.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  It was like they made $13 billion in profit
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  in the holiday quarter.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  So it was either two or three years ago.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.000]  And it seemed like a time.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.000]  Like, wow, that's amazing.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  It's sort of in that time when, you know,
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  the margins were still very, very high
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  and then everyone was thinking
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  that they were going to start coming down
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  because of different products that were coming out
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  in the future iPad and whatnot.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  And so it seemed like the $13 billion might be a high
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  watermark and now, you know,
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  that's just been totally obliterated by this quarter.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  The thing that comes to mind for me,
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  I keep thinking about it.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  I don't know why, because it's not like it's particularly
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  even a number of years.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  But four years ago was the debut,
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  or I guess it was five years ago.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  No, so it is kind of, it's a half decade.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  So five years ago, 2010 was when the original iPad came out.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  And I remember there were two things about that keynote
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.000]  that I that stand out to me.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  And it's not that iPad in particular,
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  but it was that was when they introduced the A4
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  system chip.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  And I remember Steve Jobs being very, very proud of it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  And in hindsight, it wasn't that great of a chip,
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  but I feel like the reason that he was bragging about it
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  in hindsight was that he knew the pipeline of the A5,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  the A6, like what they were planning to do year after year
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  and how they were going to take control of their own silicon
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  in the years to come.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  And the other thing I remember, do you remember this?
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  I think that was the event.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  I'm like 98% sure that it was the event
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  where he mentioned that Apple was now a $50 billion
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.000]  a year company.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  I do remember being at whatever event that was
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  when he sort of highlighted that for the first time.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.000]  I do remember that.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  Right.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  And he said almost the same thing that, like I said here,
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  it's like, we don't want to talk,
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  we have all sorts of products to talk about,
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.000]  but I just want to take a moment and just mark this
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  that we're now Apple is now a $50 billion a year company.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  And sort of saying, that's the big boy's club
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  in Silicon Valley, $50 billion a year in revenue.
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  And they did $74 billion in revenue in a quarter.
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  It's five years later, right?
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  And it really was worth marking.
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  It was really was remarkable.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  Five years ago that Apple was doing $50 billion a year in revenue.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  That's a huge number.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  It's a ton of money.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  It's way more than Apple did for decades,
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  or ever, really, until then, ever.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  And all of a sudden, that's two-thirds of one quarter.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  I mean, what are they going to hit this year?
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  So everyone's obviously talking about, in terms of earnings,
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  in terms of profit, they set the record,
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  they eclipsed all those oil companies,
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  including the Russian state oil company,
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  in terms of the amount of profit they're making.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  But they're also very much on track,
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  this being technically the physical quarter one.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  They're very much on track to break the all-time yearly record
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  for that, which is also held by all the oil companies.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  There's an outlier, the Fannie Mae outlier thing,
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  which is on the Wikipedia page,
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  but that's with the government bailout
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  and everything.
[06:13.000 --> 06:16.000]  It's not a fair comparison.
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  So they're probably going to set that record,
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  and in terms of revenue yearly revenues,
[06:20.000 --> 06:21.000]  what's it going to be this year?
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  200 billion, something like that?
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  Obviously, this is the big quarter,
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  but then next quarter should be pretty big.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.000]  Then it goes down a little bit,
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.000]  and then it'll spike up again,
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  sort of with back to school sales and everything like that.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I assume 200 billion, something like that?
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  That seems within reach definitely,
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  because what, 40, 40, 40,
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  you know, gets you pretty close.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  That's so crazy.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  And you know, remember,
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  I guess it was a couple years ago,
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  I was also covering this,
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  talking about Apple's market cap,
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  which you can also make an argument,
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  isn't really, it's sort of symbolic
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.000]  more than it's really meaningful
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  what market cap actually means
[07:01.000 --> 07:03.000]  and people always argue about that.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  It was a big deal when Apple, of course, passed Microsoft,
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  which was, I don't even know now,
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  four years ago, or maybe longer than that.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  And then Apple was chasing Exxon for a long time,
[07:12.000 --> 07:13.000]  and at one point I remember,
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  they were something like 200 billion behind in market cap,
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  and it just seemed like impossible
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  that they would ever get there.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.000]  And now there's something,
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  there are over 200 billion ahead of Exxon now.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  There might be 300 billion ahead,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  and obviously, Exxon's depressed
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  because of the oil situation going on,
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  their stock is, but it's incredible.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  I think someone has been tweeting today
[07:35.000 --> 07:37.000]  and showcasing this,
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  that I think Apple's market cap
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  is now just about the exact same as
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Google and Microsoft's combined.
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  That's insane.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Somebody tweeted, I saw yesterday,
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  this was recording on Friday, January 30th,
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  so yesterday, I think at the close of market,
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  that Apple closed with,
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  when the market's closed,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  at exactly double the market cap of Google.
[08:02.000 --> 08:04.000]  Yeah, I guess that would be great,
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.000]  because Google's actually like yourself.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  And they're almost neck and neck,
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  they're like very close to one another,
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  so yeah, that's right.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  I mean, it's almost uncanny
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  how close to exactly double it was,
[08:14.000 --> 08:15.000]  which is, yeah.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  And again, it's, you know,
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  in years past,
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  and probably years future,
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  you know, when Apple's stock is down,
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  you know, for reasons good or reasons nonsensical,
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  it's, you know, like you said,
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  it's not proof of anything.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  It's not like market cap is an infallible measure,
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  but it's at least a measure
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  of what people think of the company.
[08:43.000 --> 08:44.000]  Yeah.
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.000]  And I mean, right now,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  the craziest thing of all this is,
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.000]  you can make a very good argument
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  that Apple is undervalued on the stock market.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  They're trading at multiples that are way below
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  what some of their peers are trading at,
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  and given the numbers they just released,
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  I mean, it's not so insane anymore
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  to think that they could be the first trillion dollar company
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.000]  if they're able to sort of,
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  I mean, we could talk about what it would take.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  It would take continuing to grow iPhone,
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  and I think we all agree now, you know,
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  they can continue to do that.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  They don't have a massive market share still.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  So there's room for growth,
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  and then China, I think, is the big sort of factor in that.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  And if they can keep doing that,
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  and if the stock market overall keeps sort of going up
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  and there's no assurances of that, of course,
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  it's possible.
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  It's crazy.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  Yeah, but it's possible.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  So the elephant in the room is the right analogy,
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  but it's clearly,
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  almost two thirds, three quarters driven by iPhone.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  A iPhone has become an enormous chunk of Apple's business.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  The Mac is historically at an all-time high,
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  but still that's, you know,
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  that's an established market,
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  and it's, you know, 4 million, 5 million units a quarter.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  iPad is down, which is weird.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  It's not collapsing.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  You know, I saw somebody call it gloomy.
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000]  It's not gloomy.
[10:15.000 --> 10:18.000]  I mean, it sold 21 million iPads last quarter.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  It's just weird, though, compared to iPhone
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  because it's down 20% year over year.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  But iPhone is up enormously.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  It's almost unbelievable how much it's up.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  Because I think it was 51 million iPhones.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  They sold a year ago in the holiday quarter
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  and 74 million iPhones this year.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  Yeah.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  Yeah, I think it's, if I read the numbers,
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  right, someone broke it down, maybe it was from,
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  or I think they're at 69%.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  The iPhone is 69% of Apple's business now.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  I'm not sure if that's revenue or profit,
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  but, you know, it's about, it's roughly probably both.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  And I mean, it's probably higher actually for profit,
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  but that's crazy.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  But you're right.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  If you were to take, of course,
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.000]  the iPhone business away from Apple,
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.000]  they would still be near the top,
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  if not at the top of the biggest sort of business
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  in terms of revenue.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And then all of those other businesses,
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  both the Mac, the iPad,
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  and even, you know, increasingly,
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  iTunes and the App Store now are becoming,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  if you've broke those out,
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  they would each probably be Fortune 500 companies
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  in their own right when you think about it, which is crazy.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  Right, because the store, you know,
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  the iTunes store, whatever you want to call it,
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  the iTunes Plus App Store, is some number
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  of billion a quarter now, right?
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  Yeah, it just keeps going up.
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  And remember, they used to say specifically about the App Store
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  that, you know, it's basically,
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  they didn't use the word sort of loss leader,
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  but they just said they run it sort of break even, right?
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  And then they, you know,
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  the whole thought was that it was just out there to sell devices,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  which of course you could still make the argument
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  that's probably the biggest part of it,
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  but they're starting to make a lot of real meaningful money
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  from that store.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Yeah, and I think it's always been the case,
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  and this is from years ago when it was the numbers were much smaller,
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  where a lot of what they made was from the float
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  where they collect the money,
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  and it doesn't, you know, they can do stuff with the money,
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  you know, just, you know, they hold it for a little bit,
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  and while they're holding it, they can, you know,
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  do a financial guy thing trickery.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  Yeah, and makes a little bit of money while you hold it.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  Like, as that money passes through their fingers,
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  it's good for them because they don't,
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  you know, they don't immediately pass it on to who they're paying out.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  Right, they get a little bit of what makes Amazon Amazon,
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  sort of that aspect of the business.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  Right, and anybody who's a developer knows,
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  you don't get paid by Apple until the end of the quarter,
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  or the end of the month, you know, they hold the money.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  It's not like you get paid every day as people buy your app,
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  you wait, and then, you know, two weeks after the month is over,
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  you get, you get your check from them.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  In meantime, they're holding that money and making money on it.
[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  And now that it's enormous sums of money, it's even more so.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Yeah.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  What do you think about the notion of the,
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  correctly, if I'm wrong,
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  but they win the Apple Watch is released,
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  so they announced, of course, it's going to be shipping in April,
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  when it's released, they're not breaking that out as a separate,
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  that's going to be roped in under something else.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  I'm not sure what other services or something,
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  but they're not going to break that out in terms of sales,
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  at least to begin with.
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  Correct.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  So what they said?
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  That's what they've said.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Yeah.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  And everybody's going to try to backwards engineer it clearly
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  from the, you know, whatever it is that they report it under.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  Right.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  I think that's, that's, it's sort of interesting to think about it
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.000]  because, so I know, I know you and I know I and many others
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  have long railed it against Amazon for sort of not being transparent
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  with their numbers, whereas Apple is.
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  We still have no idea how many kindles have ever been sold.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  I think with this, this most recent quarter,
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  which Amazon had, there is some hint that you could finally back
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  into it in a way, but they still have never come out and directly
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  said, you know, what the number is.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  And with, they also announced that this quarter,
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  that the coming quarter, that they will finally be breaking out AWS,
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  you know, their cloud services infrastructure,
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  they'll be breaking out that revenue as a separate business.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  And so they'll be reporting on that.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  And I think that that's smart the way that they've done it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Well, it has been, you know, annoying for anyone who's trying to get
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  some idea of what Amazon is actually selling.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  If anything, obviously they're selling candles,
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  but fire phones, you know, and those types of things.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  But I would imagine that Apple is first putting the Apple Watch
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  under sort of this same type of thing that Apple TV is under.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  Though they do announce the Apple TV numbers.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  They just announced, you know, whatever it was, 5 million sold.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Recently, and I think it's 25 million total or something like that.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  But I would imagine that they'll keep sort of Apple Watch under wraps
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  until there's something more substantial to talk about
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  if there ever is sort of like what Amazon is done with AWS,
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  where they wrote that into something else.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  And now that it's substantial,
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  but they're going to break it out and actually talk about it.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  Yeah, I don't know, you know, for the reputation that Apple has,
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  you know, well deserved, I guess, as being secretive and relatively,
[15:31.000 --> 15:33.000]  they don't like to explain themselves.
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  You know, there's our products and that's it.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  And they don't like to talk about what they do.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  They're very forthcoming and have been in the whole, you know,
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  modern era of Apple, very forthcoming in their financial reporting.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  Yeah. And so, you know, now that I think about it,
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  I can't imagine that we're going to get an Apple Watch launch
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  without a weekend, end of weekend sort of report as to how many units
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  were shipped, sorry, were actually sold.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  Unless it's, I don't know.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I can't imagine that they don't do that, right?
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  I guess it just seems weird, you know,
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  I understand it's almost not surprising because they're secretive
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  and I feel especially the mix of, you know,
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  they don't, and they don't, one thing they don't reveal
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  and have never revealed is the mix of iPhones.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  So they don't say how many iPhone 6's were sold,
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  how many 6 Plus, how many 5C's, how many 5S's,
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  they've never revealed that.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  You can kind of get it a little bit because they do reveal
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  their average selling price and so you can kind of create a formula
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  that estimates it based on the prices that they have.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  But the watch, everybody expects that the watch is going to have
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  an incredibly wide variance in price going from the sport model
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  at 350 to however much the gold one's going to cost,
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  but most people, including me, think it's going to cost
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  at least a couple thousand dollars.
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  Yeah. So, you know, the mix on that is going to be way more
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  a way bigger divide than any other product in Apple's business.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  Yeah. And I wonder if that sort of plays into the notion of why
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  they wouldn't break out the Apple Watch too because it will be
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  because of the wide spread of prices.
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  It would be sort of maybe easier, maybe not,
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  but, you know, to know, boy, they must be selling a lot of the gold
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  version because look at these numbers or boy, they must be selling
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  basically no gold versions because you're sort of,
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  because if the average selling price is in 450 dollars or
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  something like that. That's right. Yeah.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  Yeah. I don't know. I'm quite sure. And who knows.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  Maybe once the business settles down, they will report it.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  And it's just that they don't know what to expect.
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  I, you know, it's like, you know, new territory.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  So I don't know.
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.000]  So one other notion about the watch that sort of has been interesting
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  to think about in recent weeks, sort of leading up.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  So, well, two things.
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  Do you think, are they going to do some sort of other event
[18:07.000 --> 18:14.000]  before April to more sort of put it out there in front of the world
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  one more time with a with a proper unveiling with all functionality
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  that it's going to ship with, you know, working?
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  My assumption all along has been yes,
[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  but now that it's like getting close and I'm starting to like,
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  you know, make plans for the next couple of months.
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  And, you know, there's a couple conferences that I might go to.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  And I'm thinking like, hey, which are these things?
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  Should I maybe not do because I should keep my schedule open?
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  I'm starting to wonder.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  I've always thought that, yes, they are going to.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Because I think that they have to show more of the functionality.
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  I think they have to reveal more of what the watch does
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  with the first party software.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  It's right out of the box, the stuff that's in there.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  And how better to do it than at an event?
[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  But I kind of also feel like they can't do it if they don't have anything else to show.
[19:11.000 --> 19:13.000]  I think you're right.
[19:13.000 --> 19:20.000]  And I think, so I know now that they are definitely working with some other people,
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  some third parties who you would imagine that they would be working with already
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  to sort of get things ready to go for launch.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  So that definitely points to, you know, a potential other events
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  and unveiling where they have a few of the major players
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  up on stage sort of showing off what the third party can do with this thing.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  Right.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  And I feel like there's like three levels.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  There's A, the first party software.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  What the watch does right out of the box.
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  There's the SDK that they've already revealed,
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  which is somewhat limited.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  It's the whole thing where, you know, you have to have an iPhone app.
[19:56.000 --> 19:57.000]  Right.
[19:57.000 --> 20:03.000]  And iPhone apps more or less projecting notifications to the watch.
[20:03.000 --> 20:09.000]  And they even say, I mean, and this is totally like new open Apple,
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.000]  you know, Tim Cook, you know, era where they even said
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.000]  when they revealed this initial third party SDK
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  that a full SDK with native apps will be coming later in 2015.
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.000]  Right.
[20:22.000 --> 20:24.000]  The software doesn't run on a watch.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  The software with the current SDK runs on the phone
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  and just sort of projects a UI on the watch.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  Right.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.000]  You can send a notification.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  They're almost like widgets, I guess, in a way.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  It's like a small, it's going to be packed into the iPhone app.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Yeah.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  I, you know, I feel like it's almost new territory.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  The closest thing though would be something like, you know,
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  to call it something like a widget, like a widget that you project.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  But then I feel like there's got to be a little,
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  not got to be, but almost certainly going to be a little bit more sort of
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  blessed partner third parties who are working with Apple
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  and will have things that aren't in that public SDK,
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  but are a little bit more like if you, you know,
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  are inside, if you've been embraced by Apple,
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  if they've asked you to send a guy or a team to spend three weeks
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  in Cupertino that you're going to have a little bit more tighter integration
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  with the watch.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  Right.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  Just to demonstrate it.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  And I haven't looked at the SDK nor if I did what I really have a great
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  understanding of it, but like something like having access to the music
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  that you can store on the watch, like is that available to third parties?
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Or is it not available to Apple?
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  Okay.
[21:35.000 --> 21:36.000]  Right now it's only available to Apple.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.000]  The audio playback.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  And then Marco Arman has been looking into that for the obvious reason
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  that as a podcast app that would be perfectly suited to actually
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  storing some audio on the watch itself.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  So it's not there yet.
[21:49.000 --> 21:52.000]  So you could see, though, that would be an obvious one for Apple
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  to work with trusted third parties to sort of give them access to it.
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  Maybe it's Spotify or, well, Spotify is sort of a weird one.
[22:00.000 --> 22:01.000]  I don't know how that would work.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  But something like that, you know, or running app,
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  but some sort of fitness app that can access those.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  Yeah.
[22:07.000 --> 22:13.000]  And, you know, there were like clearly before the initial event,
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  they had already been talking to some people like Starwood's hotels.
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  Oh, that's right.
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.000]  They said like, hey, you're going to be able to check into any Starwood's
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  hotel and use your watch as your key.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  Right.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  And then you get into your room just by putting your wrist up to the door,
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  which is awesome in my opinion.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  As somebody who very frequently loses his hotel key.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Yep.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  I always demagnetize mine.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Like when I put it, I always keep them in my pocket
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  and I have either like a, or I give them to my girlfriend
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  and she puts it in a person.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  She is an iPad in there and the iPad has the magnetic class
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  and it always demagnetizes the stupid key.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.000]  So, yeah.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  And they give me a hard time.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  I've done that too.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  But I've done it and I don't keep it in the same pocket as my phone.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  I keep it in a different pocket and it still doesn't work.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  I don't know.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  I think the technology in those things is pretty bad.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  But I don't know.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  And when I check into like hotels where I've, you know,
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  been a frequent customer that are like,
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  how many keys do you want three keys?
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  That's right.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  Like they got me in the file that I need extra keys.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  So the idea that you'd be able to do it,
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  but that's clearly something that if they're going to announce it
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  at the event, they would have partners lined up in advance.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  And you think that also it gives them a sort of a natural way
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  to do a little bit deeper dive into Apple Pay where it's at right now,
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  you know, sort of the six month check-in or something
[23:37.000 --> 23:40.000]  and then also to show it on the Apple Watch actually working.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  Obviously that seems like it's already been a pretty big success for them
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  and will continue to be so.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  And so that's another obvious thing that they would do
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  at such an event I would imagine.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  Yeah, I think, and it's,
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  Apple Pay is sort of an interesting thing for Apple.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  And to me, in terms of how much emphasis they're putting on it.
[23:59.000 --> 24:02.000]  And it's sort of like, to me, it's sort of like what we were talking about
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  just a couple minutes ago with the App Store and iTunes Store where
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  they're not making a ton of money on it.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  They're only making, you know, fraction of very fraction of a 1%
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  on each transaction.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's a small amount per transaction.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  Right.
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  But it's just about getting entrenched and having, you know,
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  if once you get used to it, you don't want to not have an iPhone anymore
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  because, you know, then you don't have Apple Pay and it just,
[24:27.000 --> 24:32.000]  it just is another way to sort of sink their teeth into people's daily lives.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  Yeah, you know, the money isn't anything that sneezed at, you know, it's not bad.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  No.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  It's a great moat is what, you know, what it starts out as.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  And then, over time, much like you said, like with the App Store,
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  if they can get to an interesting sort of transaction volume,
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  which they're already well on their way to doing,
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  they're going to be making a lot of money off of that.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  And they can also, of course, renegotiate the fees with the, with the
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  ranking partners to get a little bit more money off of it.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  I think they have a lot of sort of wiggle room there to be able to
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  make that into a really, really interesting business if they can get it to a scale.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Yeah.
[25:07.000 --> 25:14.000]  And I just firsthand, I've, you know, a month ago, I, I got a
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  the latest model Moto X just to sort of, you know, do the every year or two,
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  you know, what's it like to live with the latest and greatest Android?
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000]  And one of the, to me, weirdest things is, and, you know,
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  been trying to, when I'm using it, the days I'm using it, I try, you know,
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  leave the iPhone at home, just take the Moto X.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  The single weirdest thing to me out of, well, there's two things that are really
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  where one is not having eye message is really awful because there's so many
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  people now who I, because I don't get text messages anymore.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  They're all eye message.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  So my phone is the one going off my phones and, you know,
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  iPad are going off at home with the blue messages while my Moto X,
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  which has a different SIM card, you know, isn't getting these messages.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  And the second one is Apple Pay.
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  Like, every time I go to Whole Foods with that Moto X in my pocket,
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.000]  I take it out of my pocket and then realize, oh, I actually have to go back
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  and use my credit card.
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  Like, it's actually become a habit where I take the phone out before I even
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  remember that, oh, I'm walking around with the Moto X.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  I can't use it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  So that's interesting for me to hear because being over here right now
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  where I am in London, it's not actually live yet.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  I think it might be testing in a few places, but I don't, I even
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  gone around and I haven't used it here.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  I haven't seen it really anywhere.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  It might be, it might be starting to roll out at a few drug stores,
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  or they may have that sort of hack thing, you know, where it will work with
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  another NFC reader, but it's not officially supported yet.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  And so the only times that I've gotten to use it has been when I'm back
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  in San Francisco for work.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  And so I've only gotten to use it probably three times or something.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  And it's definitely, you know, it's all it was cracked up to be in my mind.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  It's, you know, just sort of a magical experience, which it almost
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  seems like it's a little bit crazy when you use it for the first time because
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  it's like, did I, you know, do I, are you sure I don't need to do anything else
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  and sort of the cashier still ask you like, yeah, I think, I think you're good.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  It's still that early stage period of the thing.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  But so you use it regularly.
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  And that's good to hear that it's, it's sort of already in your daily flow.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  Where do you go besides Whole Foods that sort of uses it?
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  There's like, I know there's Walgreens and some other bigger stores,
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  but do do any like smaller things use it that you regularly?
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  The smallest are the cabs, the taxis and Philly that have,
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  and that's a perfect example of the sort of unofficial support for it,
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  where they have these, it doesn't have an Apple Pay logo.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  It just has a, you know, stick your phone and at the terminal logo.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  Right.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  And it works there.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  And that was a total surprise to me.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  Cause I know I'd read those stories that said, you know,
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  just about any place that says you can pay by your phone, Apple Pay will work.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  And it's, it just in particular, it's, it's so much more convenient.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  Cause a lot of times when I'm in a cab, I've got my phone out because I'm bored
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  while I'm riding in the cab and I'm, you know, on the phone.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  And digging your wallet out while you're in the backseat of a cab is such a pain.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  You know, it's like you're sitting there like a contortionist trying to get your stuff out and you don't want.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  And if you can just stick your phone at the thing, it's super great.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And then it just gives you like a thing, like what percent tip do you want to give?
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  Do you want to give 18 percent?
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  Yes, boom, done.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  And then you're out of the cab.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  And maybe it gives cabs a, you know, a fighting chance against things like Uber and Lyft and whatnot.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  Cause I have the problem where I have multiple times sadly enough.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  I take Uber so much that I will get out of a cab without realizing I have to pay.
[28:49.000 --> 28:56.000]  And it's very awkward and it seems like I'm, I'm sort of crazy or, I don't know what.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  But yeah, trying to scam them.
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  Yeah.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  Yeah.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  No, that's, you know what, that's the same sort of convenience though.
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  Like Uber, Uber is to taxis what Apple pay is to credit cards.
[29:09.000 --> 29:17.000]  I mean, it's, you get used to that increase level of convenience and you forget, you know, it's, it's hard to go back.
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  Definitely.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  It's like trying to go back to, you know, an outhouse after you've had indoor plumbing.
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  That's a good analogy.
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  I like that.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  Or so I would imagine.
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  Right.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  Right.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  And back in the 1800s when I remember, right.
[29:33.000 --> 29:41.000]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor, our first sponsor is, once again, our good friends at Fracture.
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  Their website is FractureMe.com.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  You guys know Fracture.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  I've talked about them before.
[29:48.000 --> 29:57.000]  These are the guys who you send them your photos and they print them directly on glass.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  How they do it, they've got like some kind of proprietary technology.
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  They don't print them on paper and then put them in a frame underneath glass.
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  They print them directly on the glass.
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  And then they mail them back to you and these really clever little cardboard kits that
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  are self-contained things that you can either use as a prop stand.
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.000]  Like if you want to put the photos on your desk or if you want to hang them on a wall,
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  they've got a thing on the back where you can put the hook.
[30:23.000 --> 30:25.000]  But it's all self-contained.
[30:25.000 --> 30:30.000]  So when they send them back to you, you don't have to go and buy a frame and put the Fracture prints
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  in a frame, go to Ikea and get frames and stuff like that.
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  You don't have to do anything.
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  What they send you is ready to hang on your wall, ready to put on your desk.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  And they look awesome.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  I say this all the time that it's, to me, it's like when they, with the iPhone 4,
[30:47.000 --> 30:54.000]  when they first started laminating the LCD screen, the LED screen to the touch screen.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  And it looked like the pixels were right on the glass instead of under the glass.
[30:58.000 --> 31:04.000]  That's exactly what prints from Fracture look like, except that it's completely analog.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  It's not, you know, a gadget.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  But that's the equivalent for printed pictures.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  Really, really good.
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  They're a great gift idea.
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  They're a great way to do things like Marco Arman's idea where he prints.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  He makes Fracture prints square ones of all of his apps.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  If you have apps, if you make apps, make some Fracture prints of your apps.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  And you can use those as touch keys that you give out.
[31:29.000 --> 31:32.000]  Promotional giveaways or whatever.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  Just an amazing, amazing stuff.
[31:34.000 --> 31:43.000]  If you're going to get your pictures printed, I can't imagine why you do it any other way than actually just sending them to Fracture and doing it that way.
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  I am all over my house.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  I can't even count how many Fractures we've got in the house now.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  It's pretty much all the pictures from the last few years that we have hanging up are Fracture prints.
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  Really, really good.
[31:56.000 --> 32:02.000]  You can save five bucks off your first order if you use this code, Daring Fireball.

[32:20.000 --> 32:23.000]  So my thanks to Fracture.
[32:23.000 --> 32:31.000]  What I like about their site is that they compare, they show you the sizes and the comparison is always a Campbell Soup container.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  It's like it is good.
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  Sort of a random but interesting way to compare.
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.000]  Yeah.
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  And because it's like a universal everybody knows how big a can of soup is.
[32:40.000 --> 32:41.000]  Yeah.
[32:41.000 --> 32:42.000]  I like that.
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  Yeah. If you use a hand, I mean some people's hands are really bigger than others.
[32:45.000 --> 32:46.000]  Yeah.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.000]  That's true.
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.000]  So Apple's financial results.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  Two of the points that really stick out to me.
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  One is China.
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.000]  And it's clearly a huge source of growth.
[33:01.000 --> 33:07.000]  And one of the things that I've been thinking about with that in eight years in to the iPhone era.
[33:07.000 --> 33:12.000]  In the early years, it's stuck, it stood out a lot more.
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.000]  But it still is an issue is the carriers, the carrier support.
[33:18.000 --> 33:28.000]  And the growth of the iPhone in the early years, I think was clearly largely constrained by the number of carriers, you know, and especially around the world.
[33:28.000 --> 33:35.000]  I mean, it wasn't until was it 2010 or 2011 when Verizon first got the iPhone?
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  I think 2011.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  But yeah.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  But it was, you know, it was a couple of years, even in the US.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  But at the very least, if you wanted an iPhone in the US, it wasn't hard.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  You could switch.
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  You know, if you were on Verizon or on Sprint or T-Mobile or something, you'd have to switch to AT&T.
[33:50.000 --> 33:55.000]  But, you know, say what you want about AT&T, at least they are a nationwide carrier.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.000]  So everybody could get an iPhone if you wanted an iPhone.
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  But around the world, it was a huge issue.
[34:01.000 --> 34:11.000]  Like, growth in Japan was clearly constrained because they were only on like the third biggest carrier in Japan for a long time.
[34:11.000 --> 34:20.000]  And China was a similar issue, whether they weren't on the biggest national carrier in China until fairly recently.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  Yeah, I think it's almost been just about a year, right?
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  I think it's almost coming up on a year that China-Mobile has been with them, yeah.
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.000]  And as much as everybody, you know, and I, you know, I think the bigger screen size is especially in Asia.
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.000]  I mean, Tim Cook even called it out that it definitely varies by geography, how much, you know, the mix between six and six plus.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  It varies around the globe.
[34:44.000 --> 34:56.000]  I don't think it's any secret that in Asia and China and Korea and, you know, in those countries that the six plus is more popular than it is in other countries.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  So the big screen size is definitely part of it.
[35:00.000 --> 35:05.000]  But I think just the fact that it's available is almost overlooked.
[35:05.000 --> 35:06.000]  Yeah.
[35:06.000 --> 35:17.000]  What I find fascinating about that, like at the highest level is Apple, you know, there was, there was definitely some questions when they were moving into the Chinese market.
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  Would they be able to compete?
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.000]  Would they be able to succeed?
[35:19.000 --> 35:25.000]  It's a high-end product, you know, the difference in sort of buying power versus the United States.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  And all that kind of stuff, and, you know, subsidies and all that.
[35:30.000 --> 35:38.000]  But now that it's clear that Apple's business is doing very well in China and growing very quickly.
[35:38.000 --> 35:47.000]  All of, you know, the sort of other tech companies that they're, that they're stacked up against in the United States, you know, that they're compared to, of course.
[35:47.000 --> 35:55.000]  Google and Facebook and, you know, even Twitter and some of these other things that are just hot properties right now.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  Most of them have no business in China, right?
[35:58.000 --> 36:14.000]  And Apple has a giant, massive business that a lot of their competition or what is viewed or often, you know, mentioned in the same breath as them, as their competition just doesn't really have that opportunity at all.
[36:14.000 --> 36:25.000]  Yeah, I completely agree. And this is another case where, to me, Apple has been, if you're paying attention, very forthcoming about it for years now.
[36:25.000 --> 36:36.000]  I would say at least during the entire Tim Cook era, like since Steve Jobs stepped down to CEO and Tim Cook took the reins.
[36:36.000 --> 36:50.000]  I feel like quarter after quarter after quarter, Tim Cook has always made mention of China, even before China became, it was almost like we're, you know, his, he kept and continues to keep mentioning their growth in China.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  Yeah.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  And it's, you know, again, it goes against the idea that Apple is super secretive. They've, they've been very forthcoming about it.
[36:58.000 --> 37:06.000]  Now it's, I feel like they're at the point where it's, everybody's talking about it because it's gotten to be an enormous part of their business.
[37:06.000 --> 37:19.000]  Yeah. And I wonder if part of that is just honestly because, you know, when he was in still in charge of operations, he would go over there. I mean, that's where, that's where all the operations were, you know, the majority of the operations were happening.
[37:19.000 --> 37:33.000]  You know, while China was always interesting to people because of course there's a billion and a half people there. It's the most populous country and everyone knew that it was sort of coming online and becoming more prosperous and sort of becoming more affluent.
[37:33.000 --> 37:50.000]  You know, maybe his time on the ground there, he just knew like, no matter what, we have to figure this out and we need to do what it, what it takes to sort of crack this market because eventually we will saturate the United States market and the European market, you know, not as big already.
[37:50.000 --> 37:59.000]  And so where are we going to find that growth and they are positioned better than anyone right now to be able to exploit that.
[37:59.000 --> 38:14.000]  The, this is right from Apple's press release on their, their results international sales accounted for 65% of the quarters revenue. So exactly, almost exactly two thirds of the revenue is outside the US now.
[38:14.000 --> 38:23.000]  And that's a big time, right? It used to be under, it used to be under 50% and then it was hovering around 50% and now it's two thirds or whatnot.
[38:23.000 --> 38:36.000]  Definitely is way up and a big change. Years ago, many years, let's say back before, especially before the iPhone existed like in the first half of the last decade.
[38:36.000 --> 38:53.000]  The mobile market around the world was very unevenly distributed where blackberry had a huge share of the US and was almost non existent elsewhere. And eventually, before blackberry sort of imploded, they did get popular around the world.
[38:53.000 --> 39:07.000]  But I'm saying, you know, 10 years ago, blackberry was almost like a US centric phenomenon. And like Symbian was a European and Asian phenomenon and had no almost no footprint in the US.
[39:07.000 --> 39:21.000]  It was huge in Europe and in Asia and almost non existent in the US. There weren't any major carriers that had Symbian phones and under the US, you know, the companies that sold phones and the US carriers made Symbian phones.
[39:21.000 --> 39:39.000]  It was weird. And I always thought that Apple was a little, not quite as totally US centric as blackberry was then, but it was similar though, where the US was much, much stronger for Apple selling computers.
[39:39.000 --> 39:59.000]  Yeah, well, it's the rest of the world. It's not directly comparable, I guess, because obviously, blackberry was big with business users, big in Washington, big on Wall Street. But it's the market was still the more affluent market, right? And so they both sort of track to that market for a long time.
[39:59.000 --> 40:24.000]  Yeah. And I wonder too, as time goes on, I mean, you know, Apple is always going to be a US company. I mean, it's, you know, I would say in a grand scheme of things famously that they're rather, you know, in terms of like, you know, they have some remote employees, but in general, if you work for Apple, you're working in Cupertino, if you're working on product development, you know, hardware software.
[40:24.000 --> 40:37.000]  They don't really have, you know, the yes, they have, they've just started a Seattle office. They've had like a, I think the I works team has been in Pittsburgh for a long time. So there's some people who, and there's individuals who can get an exception and work remotely.
[40:37.000 --> 40:45.000]  But for the most part, people work there. It's always going to be a US company. The culture is very California centric.
[40:45.000 --> 41:02.000]  You know, I think that stamping, you know, designed by Apple and California on all their devices is actually very honest. It's, that's who the company is. But I do wonder as time goes on, how much, you know, we're spoiled. Well, you're in London now, so I don't know.
[41:02.000 --> 41:20.000]  But I mean, I've always felt like I'm spoiled because everything comes out in the US on day one as well. But I wonder how much, you know, at what point will like China be on like the day one list for iPhone because, you know, it's clearly close enough that it made a big difference in the quarter.
[41:20.000 --> 41:34.000]  You know, I agree. I mean, yeah, they, and they, I think they talked about that even in the release or so, because it was, it was two weeks later or something like that that it that the iPhone came out in China. So it wasn't day one, but it was sort of the second wave, I think.
[41:34.000 --> 41:43.000]  And I actually think about that a lot when I was moving over here. I'm like, God, I'm going to have to wait like a long time to, you know, get, get sort of the new products when they come out.
[41:43.000 --> 41:56.000]  But London's now, you know, sort of day one, they had the, the new iPads came out the same thing. You know what this reminds me of though, I think this, this tracks with sort of the, what Hollywood's going through as well, right.
[41:56.000 --> 42:04.000]  So for a long time, movies were released first in the US and then, then they would go abroad like over a long period of time, sometimes months.
[42:04.000 --> 42:31.000]  Now, increasingly, they're tracking much closer to the US release date. In some cases, they get released abroad before they get released in the US. And sort of to the, to the point I think you're getting at, which is, in Hollywood, increasingly, of importance is the Asian markets for making the, the actual money like, you know, the box office in the US is now often a minority piece of the pie compared to what they make overseas.
[42:31.000 --> 42:55.000]  And so you're starting to see movies like Transformers and things that are more catering towards Asian audiences. And I do wonder like, you know, when, when that happens with Apple when the tip happens fully that sort of the, either the Asian markets or a combination of, of Asia and some other, you know, areas around there end up being bigger than the US.
[42:55.000 --> 43:12.000]  Like, do they change the, the company in any way to make it more focused on that region? Do they do sort of specific devices? I think we talked about this way back when that like, you know, in order to sell an iPhone in China, they would have to do like a special version of it or whatnot.
[43:12.000 --> 43:26.000]  And then it, the notion was always that they would never do that. They would always just have sort of, while they could, while they change up the technology inside for the different carriers or whatever, they would always, they would never stray from having sort of a streamlined product line that's offered around the world.
[43:26.000 --> 43:52.000]  But does that change at all if China becomes like 75% of the business like in the future say, I don't know. I don't know either, but it's, you know, the fact that it's within two weeks is remarkable. And, you know, again, I think it's a combination of, of multiple factors. I think it's the fact that they're now on, you know, the major carrier in China, which makes a huge difference in terms of how many people can get it.
[43:52.000 --> 44:07.000]  The fact that China's economy is, is growing and that there's an ever increasing number of Chinese citizens who have the kind of income that they could buy an iPhone. I mean, clearly I'm a majority of people in China can't.
[44:07.000 --> 44:20.000]  Right. No, no argument there. But there's a, you know, take any percentage of how many billion people there are in China. And if, you know, 10% or something like that is a huge number of people.
[44:20.000 --> 44:35.000]  Yes, after US already. That's right. Great. It's, it's just enormous. I think that they reported that they did, you know, they called the brick countries Brazil, Russia, India, China, which is where because they're very, they're all very different.
[44:35.000 --> 44:47.000]  But it's more or less for countries with a ton of people and, you know, wide income disparity, I guess. Yeah, that they're doing well in all four of those countries.
[44:47.000 --> 44:58.000]  Yeah, I would, I even looked into it, but I would imagine that. So India is probably the farthest behind that seems to be the case with, you know, basically everything because they're, while they also have a billion people there.
[44:58.000 --> 45:13.000]  And I think they would, I think they're on pace to eventually eclipse China in terms of population. But while they do have a billion people right now, well over a billion people right now, the society is quite different there.
[45:13.000 --> 45:26.000]  And, you know, it's still, the iPhone is still viewed as a way out of reach for most people whereas in China, you know, there's a, there's, as you mentioned, there's a growing segment of the population that can and is buying the iPhone right now.
[45:26.000 --> 45:42.000]  Yeah, and I think, I think in broad strokes, that's exactly right that India, it might be growing faster population wise, but that the economy is nowhere near as strong as China's in terms of a growing, you know, western style middle class.
[45:42.000 --> 45:55.000]  And that's what, Xiaomi, right, is going after India is like their big focus because they know that they have an opening there that Apple probably can't go after at least any time in the, you know, next couple of years or something.
[45:55.000 --> 46:09.000]  Right, I totally agree. And I think that they have a great opportunity, but I feel like all of the, and you still see it, you still see it where it's, you know, when Xiaomi comes out with something and it's, what does it mean for Apple, how can Apple compete?
[46:09.000 --> 46:25.000]  To me, they're a huge problem for Samsung and for all the other hand, Android handset makers and not that they're irrelevant to Apple, but it's, it's all in that segment underneath what Apple is targeting.
[46:25.000 --> 46:38.000]  That's right. I mean, just look at what, what has happened to Samsung, they've been, while they're, you know, they're still making a lot of money, their growth has been just, just totally eaten into and likely by Xiaomi and Apple, of course.
[46:38.000 --> 46:50.000]  At the, at the top end, but they're being squeezed, you know, not unlike Microsoft has squeezed in the US from sort of, you know, Chrome OS on the low end and, and, you know, MacBook still sales rising.
[46:50.000 --> 47:01.000]  It's the same thing just happened just in a very condensed time to Samsung. It's, it's sort of incredible how fast it happened to Samsung, but, you know, they're in, they're in this like precarious situation right now because of that.
[47:01.000 --> 47:09.000]  Yeah, actually, I think Samsung revenue and profits are actually down, not just stagnant. Okay. Yeah.
[47:09.000 --> 47:14.000]  Did it just reported their results? Hold on, let me Google it. Sure.
[47:14.000 --> 47:29.000]  One other thing about China is I wonder, so another thing about the Chinese market that, that you hear come up time and time again is actually that, that the watch industry is pretty massive there as, as the, the population grows and affluence.
[47:29.000 --> 47:41.000]  They're sort of looking to these different traditional areas of affluence like wine and watches, of course, is one. And so what does that mean for Apple watch there? And I don't know.
[47:41.000 --> 47:54.000]  But it could mean major things if, if the product is successful that, you know, it becomes, if maybe from day one, it's a bigger seller in China than it is in the US.
[47:54.000 --> 48:07.000]  Yeah, I think so. I don't know if I mentioned this on the show before. I saw a documentary a couple months ago is great. It's on iTunes called red obsession. Have you seen this? No, it's, it's about the wine industry.
[48:07.000 --> 48:32.000]  Great documentary, just note the name red obsession. But the gist of it is about how the Asian market has completely disrupted the sale and price of wine, like that they'll go in. There's Chinese buyers of wholesale wine who will go into like, you know, high end French.
[48:32.000 --> 48:40.000]  What do you call a winemaker? Not a distillery. What's the word? winery? Yeah, winery. Yeah.
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.000]  And just buy, they'll, they would just come in and just say like, we'll buy all of it. We'll just take it all.
[48:46.000 --> 48:58.000]  Like what? And they're like, we'll just take all of all this is great. Your, your wine this year is this, this, you know, this poor dough is fantastic. Just give it, you know, just send all of it to China. That's it all of it.
[48:58.000 --> 49:09.000]  And then, you know, like there's people who are used to buying the wine from this place in America and, you know, elsewhere in Europe and they're like, what do you mean you don't have any in your life? We sold it all to China.
[49:09.000 --> 49:18.000]  That's it. I have, I have a very, I have a firsthand account of that. I was, you know, being being situated in Europe now. It's pretty easy to obviously get around and go places like Paris.
[49:18.000 --> 49:32.000]  And I think we were in Switzerland over the summer and we're in a small little vineyard place in the middle of nowhere. And we are there with the only other people in the room is a, is a Chinese family sort of tasting the wine.
[49:32.000 --> 49:46.000]  And you look around and we were, you know, thinking about buying a bottle or whatever. They had so few bottles that were actually, you know, earmarked that could be sold to sort of people who walk in.
[49:46.000 --> 49:56.000]  So much was earmarked to go to China and they even print Chinese labels and this is, you know, in the middle of Switzerland and it's like they're this little, this little winery we're in.
[49:56.000 --> 50:10.000]  They are experiencing, you know, just what you're talking about where they just know that their market now is basically China is a huge part of it. I don't know what the percentage was, but say it's 75% and then the rest of the world is like 25%.
[50:10.000 --> 50:16.000]  So they store some for, you know, for the rest of the world, but then the most of it is just going to be sense of China.
[50:16.000 --> 50:34.000]  Right. And, you know, extrapolate from that what happens if China, if their economy keeps growing and a bigger and bigger percentage of their citizens grow into what we would consider like middle or upper class, you know, incomes and, you know, the potential for growth there is just phenomenal.
[50:34.000 --> 50:44.000]  And so what does, so I mean, like the Apple Watch really could be the first product that's that's a massive hits in China bigger than it is in the U.S.
[50:44.000 --> 51:02.000]  And like that's injured, that's weird to think about right that there would be it's always been that the U.S. has sort of been the leader ahead of the game, I guess, in terms of Apple and technology and then the rest of the world sort of catches on by stages and that doesn't also just mean in terms of the U.S. being more affluent
[51:02.000 --> 51:11.000]  and having, you know, more buying power or whatever. Sometimes it's just, you know, it's everything from the Apple releases the products here first.
[51:11.000 --> 51:24.000]  Traditionally they have to, you know, every being sort of the benefits of scale and so everyone you know has an iPhone and so you can use things like air drop and things like that.
[51:24.000 --> 51:33.000]  And so it becomes and and I message and so it becomes a more compelling option, but it hasn't been that another country has really taken off first.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  And I don't think that it's a crazy notion that Apple Watch could be one of those things.
[51:39.000 --> 51:49.000]  Yeah, I don't think so either. And I think that the gold models, the addition level plays right into that.
[51:49.000 --> 51:57.000]  And that's right, you know, it it's totally like a feel thing, not a thing thing.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  It doesn't make logical sense, right?
[51:59.000 --> 52:08.000]  It logically it makes no sense for anybody to buy the gold version of the watch if they aluminum one does the exact same function at $350.
[52:08.000 --> 52:15.000]  But that's jewelry jewelry is entirely a, you know, how it makes you feel type thing not like a logical thing.
[52:15.000 --> 52:25.000]  Nobody needs any kind of jewelry. That's right. And you know, it's a long, you know, it's a long standing, you know, it's, you know, it goes back to the beginnings of human civilization.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  It's, you know, there's no you can't argue with it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:41.000]  But I feel like in America, it's, you know, let's just say when they when they do come out with the watch and they announce the final pricing and let's say that the addition ones are $4,000.
[52:41.000 --> 52:49.000]  There's, I'm telling you, I still think even after all these months of people saying, Hey, I think these gold ones might cost thousands of dollars. I think these gold ones might cost thousands of dollars.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  When they announce it, I'm telling you, in America, people are going to ship their pants. Oh, yeah, they're going to be like I cannot.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  I cannot friggin believe this that, you know, they're out of they've Johnny, I've as lost as frickin mine.
[53:00.000 --> 53:09.000]  You know, that wine in the world is anybody again. And in the meantime, people in China and in Asia, you know, other places in Asia are going to start lining up to buy them.
[53:09.000 --> 53:19.000]  Oh, yeah, I totally agree with you. I mean, it could be, it's because it's just there needs to be a mindset change which only can happen sort of over time.
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.000]  I think everyone, including me, even when I think about it, I'm viewing this as a technology product.
[53:24.000 --> 53:40.000]  What technology product will I, would I buy these days that costs say $5,000 for $5,000? I mean, it used to be televisions cost that much. Now they don't anymore. They've come down and price a lot. It used to be computers cost that much. Now they don't anymore. They're about half that price for a high end one.
[53:40.000 --> 53:49.000]  And so what else is there out there in the technology world that would cost that amount of money? I mean, trying to think of something now and I can't really come up with anything, right?
[53:49.000 --> 54:05.000]  And so this, all of a sudden, the small little gadget becomes the most expensive piece of technology that you can buy on the market and why an earth would anyone do that when you can also get basically the same thing, you know, for $350 for the sport edition or whatnot.
[54:05.000 --> 54:15.000]  And yeah, it's exactly what you said. You have to, the mentality has to shift around it that this is actually jewelry and that's, I mean, you know, that's why Apple's doing what they're doing.
[54:15.000 --> 54:25.000]  And that's why they're hiring the people that they're hiring, obviously. There's some serious cultural differences too where, and I'm not an expert on it. I mean, Ben Thompson is, he lives over there.
[54:25.000 --> 54:35.000]  But I mean, I know enough about Asia though to know that they're, they're culturally their view of money is very different than us in the West in the West.
[54:35.000 --> 54:44.000]  Not that we're ashamed of it, but it's money is considered like a private matter, you know, if you're wealthy, it's considered uncouth to flaunt it.
[54:44.000 --> 55:09.000]  Right. And in Asia, that's not the case at all. So like I remember specifically, like when a watch was first announced, I was listening to accidental tech podcast and Marco Arment had just said something something I think in reference to the gold one that like, if he was at WWDC next year after the watch was out, he would be embarrassed to be out like, you know, having cocktails at five or six in the afternoon after WWDC and have a gold watch.
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.000]  But he could know it was $4,000. And I know exactly what he's talking about. I know, you know, I sort of feel the same way.
[55:16.000 --> 55:25.000]  Whereas in Asia, that wouldn't, nobody would ever, that nobody would ever say that. Nobody would ever say I'm embarrassed to have what everybody knows is a $4,000 watch on my wrist.
[55:25.000 --> 55:37.000]  Right. Yeah. No, that's a great point. I mean, and I think that's true. You see that even before the watch, like when, you know, when you buy, when you buy one of the new iPhones for the first time, you know, day one, you get it.
[55:37.000 --> 55:51.000]  And you know that like plenty of people all know that this is especially say with a six plus because it's such a different size. And so everyone's like looking at that like, wow, that guy just dropped, you know, whatever $700 to get that phone.
[55:51.000 --> 56:01.000]  And I'm still stuck here with the with the 3GS model. And you know, one day, you know, I hope to get that. But there's there's already that sort of that sort of thing where you're looking at this.
[56:01.000 --> 56:07.000]  Yeah, everyone's going to know that I just spent $700 and it's even though it's an awesome device and, and I want to use it out there.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  It's like, should I really take this out of my pocket here and, you know, sort of flaunts it in front of everyone. Yeah.
[56:12.000 --> 56:19.000]  Let's take a break. I'm going to thank our second sponsor. It's our good friends at back blaze.
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.000]  You guys know back blaze. I've been talking about them for months. I can't believe everybody who listens to this show hasn't signed up for yet.
[56:25.000 --> 56:39.000]  It's on online cloud based unlimited backup for your Mac. You sign up for back blaze. You get a month free. Just sign up. No credit card. You install their app.
[56:39.000 --> 56:53.000]  Simple little Mac app written by former Apple engineers runs perfectly quietly. It doesn't doesn't interfere with anything. You install it forget about it. It backs up everything on your Mac to your back blaze account in the cloud.
[56:53.000 --> 57:05.000]  Everything. Your entire startup drive. Do you have external hard drive? It'll back that up to everything. It doesn't matter how much you have unlimited. There's no size limit. There is no catch. There's no pricing tier for more storage.
[57:05.000 --> 57:17.000]  However much you have to back up. You just back it up. You just install back blaze and as soon as it uploads, it's all there. Everything. Then once it's all backed up.
[57:17.000 --> 57:32.000]  If disaster strikes, if your hard drive fails, if your MacBook gets stolen, if you spill water on your MacBook, you can get a complete restore of your system.
[57:32.000 --> 57:41.000]  You don't have to download it even either. You can just log in and have them put it on a USB hard drive and mail it to you. They'll FedEx it to you one day later.
[57:41.000 --> 57:52.000]  You've got your whole thing on a USB drive right there in your hands. Or it's not just for disaster. Maybe you just need one file, but your computers at home and you've got your phone.
[57:52.000 --> 58:06.000]  Well, they've got an app. You fire up the app on your iPhone and you can access every file on your system right there from the iPhone and mail it or text it or share it however you want right there from your phone.
[58:06.000 --> 58:16.000]  A huge majority of the use of back blaze is one file at a time. They've got years of experience.
[58:16.000 --> 58:25.000]  I don't even know the word for how much they have backed up. Terabytes, whatever is bigger than terabytes, petabytes I think.
[58:25.000 --> 58:37.000]  It's such a great thing. I've got it. I've been using it forever. I would wholeheartedly recommend it even if they weren't a sponsor of the show. Just install it, put it on your parents' machine.
[58:37.000 --> 58:47.000]  That way their whole system is backed up offline outside the house. It's just a remarkable peace of mind when you know that everything on your system is backed up.
[58:47.000 --> 58:58.000]  And it's just five bucks a month per Mac. Five bucks a month and you have everything backed up safe and sound outside your house in the cloud.
[58:58.000 --> 59:08.000]  Where do you go? Go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball. Slash daring fireball. That way they'll know you came from the show.
[59:08.000 --> 59:14.000]  So backblaze, go sign up for them.
[59:14.000 --> 59:26.000]  Here's another thing about the iPhone. I want to talk to you about this. I know you've written about it.
[59:26.000 --> 59:34.000]  The iPhone 5C I think is the most misunderstood iPhone that Apple has ever made.
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  Do you think the iPhone 5C, what do you think the point of the iPhone 5C?
[59:40.000 --> 59:48.000]  My thoughts have changed. I don't know obviously. I haven't talked to anyone.
[59:48.000 --> 59:54.000]  Sort of with for secondhand knowledge of this of what the point was.
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  And I don't know. I don't have a good enough sense of that to know for sure.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  But my thought process has changed over time.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  At first, everyone is talking about it of course is the quote unquote cheap iPhone which ended up being incorrect.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  And then it became sort of the first product that was launched under the unified Johnny I've sort of designed and software and hardware designed at Apple.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  So it was iOS 7 and we got the new flat designed of colorful fluorescent look and those phones seem to go nicely with that.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  I still think even I still have a blue model of the iPhone 5C that I still think is I know I'm sort of in the minority here.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  But I thought it was a beautiful device when paired with iOS 7 at the time. I don't even hope I've upgraded it to iOS 8. It's sitting in a drawer somewhere obviously with iPhone 6 out now.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  But I thought it was a beautiful device and sort of the way it played with the wallpapers that they had for iOS 7.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  And it just seemed like it was a device that Johnny I wanted to create to showcase the new software that he was creating for the first time.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Whereas the iPhone 5S was also a great design, great industrial design, but different it was sort of the extension of what they had already done before doing this new software.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  And so that was my thought process for a while.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Then, you know, Apple just didn't sort of continue the line, right? And so now we have the six and the six plus and we have three colors, three sort of tenths each of those, but no more colorful range anymore.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  And now we're sort of going towards as we head towards Apple Watch where that's obviously going to be the most customizable Apple device that Apple has ever done.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  You know, maybe that's enough to sort of placate the people who want a different type of design. And I don't know, what are your thoughts on it?
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  I feel like I gave myself credit for not really buying into the whole like, it leaked months in advance that they were doing a plastic phone.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  And that's just inevitable when you're making things in this quantity that the news leaks from the Asian supply chain.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And every, you know, not everybody, but the conventional wisdom was, oh, Apple's going after cheap, the cheap market. They're going to sell this thing cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  And then it wasn't cheap. It was like, you know, unlocked. It was started at like 550 bucks, which is not by anybody's, you know, it's certainly cheaper than the five S was, but it wasn't cheap.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  And I never bought into that and never made sense to me that Apple would suddenly lurch after the low end of the market and just go for markets here.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  So I gave my, you know, padded myself on the back for getting the five C just because I didn't never bought into it being cheap.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  But I think I missed the boat though. I think just by just by thinking, well, it's not going to be cheap isn't enough.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And I almost feel like in hindsight, when it came out, it wasn't even, it, not that they didn't want to sell it in the first year.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  But it almost wasn't even meant for that year. I think it was meant for the long haul and like where it is now, like at the, you know, the free with contract level of, right, iPhone.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  That it had, you know, the news aspect ratio for the screen. It wasn't three and a half inches. It was four inches and 16 by nine.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And the, you know, I do think I agree with you. I think they're proud of the industrial design of it.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I think Apple really likes that look. And I think again, I think you're right. I think it's very astute that it, it does seem to be much more in harmony with the aesthetics of iOS seven and eight.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  And then the aluminum phones, the five S and the sixes.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  And I know a lot of people, not tons, but I know enough, you know, who, who have the five C because they just, they like the way it looks.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Right, even though it was slower, even though it's fast.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Yeah, yeah, you know, that they're, that the iPhone is sort of gotten to the point where, you know, whatever the difference in performances doesn't matter.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  They're not waiting for anything anyway. It doesn't take any longer. You're mostly waiting for stuff to download, right?
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Instagram doesn't run slower on the five C. It's, you're just waiting for the pictures to come down the pipe.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  Yeah.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Yeah, they just like the way it looks. And I almost feel it was all about like establishing an aesthetic that fits at the lower end of the product lineup so that they don't have the free with contract phone being a premium.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Yeah, that's a really interesting thought. I totally understand what you're, what you're saying there.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  Because it, it's weird when you buy something brand new, like say the, the six now.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  And then you know in two years, this is going to be viewed as sort of the, the quote unquote, whether it's fair, not the cheap version, right?
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  It's going to not only will it, we all know things to great in value over time as they're sort of used and everything.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  But it's weird, the notion that as soon as you buy it, you know that in two years, this will be on, you know, sort of Verizon ad spreads saying like free.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  And this is, this is the cheap version now. And so if Apple can get around that by creating a product that's sort of separate from the high end to begin with from the high end meeting, they're actual most expensive things even though as we just talked about, it's not that much cheaper.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  That creates a different sort of psychological dynamic to it. I also think, and I, so I had written a post a long time ago, maybe a year ago, I guess.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:06.000]  Talking about like how odd it is that every advert advertisement I see around, I think it was around still San Francisco and sort of, I think it was in Seattle actually when I saw one that sort of made me think about this.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  That every ad I was seeing was for the iPhone 5C and not the 5S. There were a few ads for the 5S, but almost all of them are certainly around the Bay Area refer the 5C.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  And I at first I interpreted that as it must not be selling well and Apple feels like they need to pump up the advertising to sort of boost it up.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  And that may have been the case, I don't really know, but I did get a lot of pushback for it and I think some of it was a Stute pushback thinking like actually this is sort of the perfect device along lines of what we were just talking about.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  This is sort of the perfect device for Apple to showcase in their advertisements because it's colorful. It sort of goes perfectly with iOS 7.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  It's sort of part of this, the playful ads that Apple likes to do.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  And so it ended up being in a way like the poster child for a long time for all those ads around different cities and certainly in the US, I don't know about the rest of the world.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  And what if it was like, you know, just sort of a product that they thought was really beautiful and they knew that it could sort of get people in the stores by having these colorful ads and then, you know, then either they buy this device and that's great for them or they, you know, they decide to buy the more expensive device.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  Yeah, I remember that post and it's actually why I brought it up with you. I don't know how I'll look it up and I'll put it in the show notes, but I do remember that post and I remember disagreeing with it because it was right around the time when it first started dawning on me that I had underestimated the 5C.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And like I said, I think that this year is the year where the 5C is exactly where Apple wants it to be. I feel like it's, I feel like the hardest part of Apple's business is now that they've hit these insane quantities for iPhones.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  It's really, really hard and their, their pipeline is so long. Like how do you, how do you ship 74 million new iPhones and who knows what percentage of them were they iPhone 6, but it's, I think it's a majority of them last quarter.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  How do you make that many in the first quarter that it's available? Well, part of the, how they do it is that it's planned out years in advance.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  I mean, like, I think it's about a two year pipeline for their iPhones, you know, like more or less that the iPhone 6 and 6 plus were about two years into making and it's dangerous for them.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  And I feel like that's partly why they're, I think in hindsight, they were probably a year late to the big phone market. I think that if they could, if they could go back and do everything over again, I think that they would probably put the iPhone 6 and 6 plus one year ahead on the schedule.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Because it was, but it, it takes too long for them to get everything set up so they can make these quantities. They can't act fast and just say, okay, we'll make a five and a half inch phone, but we're only going to be able to make a million of them because it's new and we're not ready for it.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Well, they can't do that. They can't have a phone that they can only make a million of in the first quarter. Yep, I agree.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  But I feel like the five C was something where they were thinking ahead over a year and they wanted to have a phone that sat at this sort of, you know, in fact, they've gone to four levels, right?
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  They've got the six plus, which is $100 more for the same specs compared to the six.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  So they've got the six plus where you pay $100 premium for the bigger screen with the extra pixels.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Then there's the six, which sits where the iPhone always had the new iPhones always have same price levels.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Then one cut down $100 down is the five S, which is still a premium device, right? The five S is an end, you know, we could do all show about it, but in my opinion, it's still my favorite iPhone that they've ever made.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  And now the five C at that free with contract level is so much more natural than if they were selling, if they had stuck to the original plan and hadn't made this one device that is so unusual with, you know, the plastic body and it never was at the high end, you know, effectively though the five C is where if they had stuck to the plan and done the same thing they've done every other year, that would still be the original iPhone five without the S.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  Right. And instead, which is like visually indistinguishable from the five S, accepted, you know, it doesn't have touch ID, but at a glance it looks the same.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Whereas now it at a glance it's instantly recognizable as different.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Yes, that's a good point. I've thought I've brought, I think I've written about that as well, that sort of notion as well that there was the problem with the S lines where they look the same.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  And so it's like, well, yes, they're faster inside. Like what is it that's sort of differentiating on the outside. There was nothing for a while. And now the five C gives you a very differentiated factor.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  But what do you think then, you know, sort of the obvious lead into that is what do you think they end up doing the next iteration.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So we're coming up on, you know, the fall of 2015, the assumption I would assume is that they do an iPhone 6S, and then do they have an iPhone 6C?
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  And what do they do with them? Do they have a plus S? And how do they keep the line going?
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  How big would it be? How big would it be? Would it be 4.7 inches? Or would it be 5.5? Would it be both? I don't think it would be both.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  I think that they, it's an excellent question. I'm really kind of at a loss to guess what they're going to do this year.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Kind of guess they're going to do at the high end 6S and a 6S plus, which would be this look a lot like the, you know, just the typical S, you know, TikTok revisions. Right.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  But then what do they do at that pricing level below where the 5S is now? And they're really wonder. Do they keep the 6 and 6 plus? And, you know, I don't think so.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  We're getting pretty convoluted then at that point as to what the offerings are. Yeah, I don't think so. I kind of feel, and I kind of feel like the way that they're, and it's somewhat arbitrary because I don't think that the actual cost is that much different for the different sizes.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  But I kind of feel like they'll, if I had to guess, maybe like they'll call it a 6C and it would be a 4 inch screen, but with the specs of the iPhone 6. So that's interesting because one thing that has always been humorous to me for the past couple years now.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Remember when the iPhone first came out and everyone was clamoring like we need an iPhone Nano. And, you know, and this is when the iPhone was a 3.5 inch screen, the original iPhone.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  And people were saying it's too big like we, you know, we're coming from world of flip phones like the end of razor and things of the Motorola razor.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  We need a smaller device. I don't want anything bigger. And now it's like no one talks about that anymore. And when you do hold even a 5 and 5S, you know, next to the 6 plus, it's sort of comical how small it seems.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  And I don't even know when the last time I held a 4 was let alone, you know, some of the, even the older ones. But do you think that they go to a world where we have now the 6 inch screen.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Is it a 5, 5 and a half inch screen. And then is it a 4 inch screen. Or do they do some other like variation on that. But is the 3 SKUs. It seems to me like 3 SKUs is pretty good because you can offer different things at each for what people want.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Some people want us may might want a smaller phone. The problem of course is with developers. It's a pain in the ass to have to, you know, support all of these different screen sizes still.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  So Apple traditionally, as you know, has been pretty good about retiring older sort of technology and making it so that you don't have to support that rather, you know, they push forward. But what do you think that they would do there.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I don't know. It's interesting to me. I, whether they say 4.7, like one way they could go would be to say 4.7 is the new small iPhone size. And now the $99 mid tier $99 with contract mid tier phone is also 4.7 inches.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  They could do that. And then that to me would be a strong signal that the 4 inch size, you know, I'm sure that they would still have something at the, you know, free with contract level that still has a 4 inch screen at the end of, you know, next year.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  But that it's on the way out. But on the other hand, I could see them going though where they still say you can still get a 4 inch phone. You know, we've got the, you know, small medium and large such screen sizes and, you know, 4 inch is our mid tier size.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  It would, you know, have the same, you know, the A8 from the iPhone 6, the camera from the iPhone 6. But in a 4 inch form factor. But would that form factor be plastic like the 5C or would it be metal like the 5S? I don't know.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Again, and I guess the, you know, the other, the other thing to bring up is that I think now, are we at the point now where everything has the lightning connector? We are right. Yeah, we are with the iPhones. Yeah, that's, but that's, we're not at the place where everything has touch ID.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  And I assume that Apple wants to get there for Apple pay, especially. And then just overall to simplify and make it easier for developers who are trying to support touch ID and, you know, there's the fallback of course of just using passwords.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  I would assume that they want to get everyone on touch ID so even the low end ones. Do you think you agree with that? Well, I don't know because that's the, so the weird thing.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  It's like I said, like I think like this year right now until the end of the year the 5C is exactly what Apple wanted. They've got this, you know, a nice phone.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Everybody likes it. It's easily advertised. It's colorful.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  But because they didn't rev it last year, my assumption is at the end of this year, the 5C as we know it goes away.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  That just, you know, falls off the bottom of the product list and it's gone. And it's replaced by what?
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  If they just keep moving things down the line, it would be replaced by the 5S, which does have touch ID but doesn't do retail Apple pay.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Like it only does Apple pay like in apps, which it doesn't seem to have taken off yet.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Right. Because it doesn't have NFC. Right.
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  Right. And it also, if they do that, it goes against my thinking that they want the bottom of the line phone to not have that premium metal industrial design.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  Right. So I don't know. Like do they come out with a new plastic model that they abuse at that free tier?
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  Well, it seems like an awful lot of new SKUs. Right. Yes. Yes.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  Because I also feel like part of, just part of the reason that they can make all these new iPhones is that they're only making one or two new phones a year.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  And the other ones are these things, you know, like the 5S that they already know how to make.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  And it just, you know, just keep making them like you did last year.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  You know, the other thing that throws a wrench into it is what they did this year.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And this is another discussion, you know, to the iPad mini where they didn't update the internals at all.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  But they gave it touch ID and like why why even bother to do that, you know, when they're when there was the only sort of upgrade that they did.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And now there's the whole debate, you know, did the iPhone is the iPhone 6 Plus eating into iPad mini sales specifically.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  And what do they do with the future of that line? And is there a future of that line?
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  Yeah, it's a good question. I, you know, so maybe, I don't know, like, could they come out with like the equivalent of a 5C, but just add touch ID?
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Yep, potentially. That's, that would be, that would be something that I might guess would be something that they do.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  Because I do agree that they want to keep obviously they want to have differentiating factors for the premium.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  But I do think that their strategy is, is pretty strong right now around Apple Pay.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  And I would imagine that they want, like we talked about earlier, they want that to be a moat, a new moat that sort of creates a reason why you're in the Apple ecosystem, regardless of which device you have.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  And so my guess would be, yes, they have something like an iPhone 6C that has touch ID and NFC, they had both of those to it.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  Yeah, but maybe like old and a, you know, a seriously older A series chip like an A6 or something like that.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  Right. And that's how they differentiate. It's not nearly as fast as sort of the high end and it's maybe plastic.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  And so plastic not as fast. The camera's not quite as nice, but it does still have Apple Pay and touch ID.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Yeah, at the very least, I can't imagine that they'll ever, at any price point. I can't imagine that they'll ever come out with any new iPhones that don't do NFC and Apple Pay.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  Yeah. But it's a big question is how, you know, if they keep the five S around though and move it down the product here.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  Right. You know, that's another year then know that they have a phone that doesn't have Apple Pay and NFC.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Yeah. And yeah, I mean, that's an interesting dilemma for them to have though they've always dealt with that fine in the past sort of keeping those products around longer than anyone else thinks that they should.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And obviously they, they have the data to back that up that they should do that.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Yeah, totally. All right. I want to tell you about a new sponsor here on the show and that sponsor is Oscar.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Oscar is a new health insurance company. Now, this is US centric. And in fact, right now, it's limited to New York and New Jersey.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  But they are a new insurance company focused on consumers who are able to buy their own health insurance through the new Affordable Care Act, AKA Obamacare.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  The insurance marketplace is that are new here in the US.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  So in most cases, you know, existing health insurance companies are terrible and they're particularly poor for people like me who are self employed and don't get insurance through any sort of group or a job or a business or something like that.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Buying insurance as health insurance in the US as an individual or as a family is just an enormous hassle on a bad deal and you get bad service.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  Oscar is designed to change all of that. They already did first year, last year they started in New York and had a great year. This is their second year of signing up new customers.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  Here's where they're available because it doesn't matter if you don't live in one of these counties, it's not going to work. If you're in New York, the Oscars available in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, Staten Island, Rockland, Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk Countings.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  In New Jersey, they're available in Passaic, Morris, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, Middlesex, Monmouth, and Ocean Counties.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  They have all sorts of great stuff. Oscar is truly a health insurance company for the modern age and for the individuals.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  They have an app and a website where you can do everything from your medical records, track your medical history, find a doctor, talk to one of the doctors that's in the Oscar plan.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  They have a great network of providers and hospitals in the New York and North Jersey metro areas. Lots and lots of doctors.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  They really just go out of the way to make everything easy and to make your benefits what you get through your insurance.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Both the generous and very, very clear. It's a new kind of health insurance company.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  Instead of obfuscating your benefits, they spell a lot in very clean language.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  They have a feature called Doctors on Call. You can use the app, use their website, and have a board-certified doctor call you for free 24-7.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Plans include benefits like free checkups, free generic drugs, free primary care doctor visits, and more.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  They cover you from head to toe with simple benefits that anyone can understand.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Now here's the thing, there's some urgency involved here due to the way the Affordable Care Act works.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  You need to sign up by February 15, 2015, for insurance starting March 1.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  So by February 15, so if you're in the market for health insurance, if you're available for the Affordable Care Act and you pay for your own health insurance,
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  and you live in one of those counties in New York and New Jersey, I really encourage you to call Oscar or check out their website and find out more because it's a great deal.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Now I can't get it because I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but a friend of the show, editor of the show, Dave Whiskis, lives in New York,
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  and he's switched his health insurance to Oscar and says that it's great.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  So here's where you go to find out more.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Their website is highosker.com.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  H-I-osker.com, like, hello, Oscars. Highosker.com slash the talk show, then they'll know you came here from this podcast.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Highosker.com slash the talk show, or you can call them at 1-855-OSKER-97.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  That number once again is 1-855-OSKER-97.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  My thanks to Oscar, if you're in the market for health insurance in New York and New Jersey, go check them out.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  It really seems like a great, great deal.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  All right, anything else on your mind?
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  No, I mean, I'm still, so I was back in San Francisco when a couple weeks ago for a while.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And, you know, I've been sort of going back and forth about Apple Watch.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  So unlike you, I wasn't at the event, the unveiling, and so I didn't get a chance to sort of see it and sort of get a better sense of what it was.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  I watched the, you know, the keynote sort of, it's great that they stream it live.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And so I could watch it here despite their technical hiccups, I'm sure you heard about.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  You know, it was bad.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  Yeah, it was really bad.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  But they fixed it a little bit for the later one.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  But, so I wasn't sure really what to make of Apple Watch.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  And I'm still sort of trying to get there, but I had a number of interesting discussions with people more in the know while I was back and sort of thinking through things of where this is going to go.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And I'm starting to get a lot more bullish on Apple Watch than I was to begin with.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  Not to say that I was bearish on it, but I was wondering, I was sort of wondering a lot of what we talked about.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Sort of, you know, how many people are going to pay a premium for a gold one? How many people are going to buy the edition one?
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  How many people are going to buy, you know, the cheaper sport one? And what does it mean?
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  And then when they released SDK, and just like we were talking about earlier, it sort of seemed like they were more widget like apps rather than true apps.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And it seemed like, you know, Apple was already telepathic into the future where they're going to make them more robust apps.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  So they're almost like saying like, yeah, we're going to put this out there, but V2 of this is going to be real is when things get really interesting.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  And so, you know, it's sort of the old problem that Apple has had amongst many people who believe, you know, like don't buy the first version of something like they always make it better the second version.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  But I am definitely getting more bullish on it now after having sort of had a few chats and learned a lot more about what it's actually doing.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Where's your mind at with it?
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  I've never been either bullish or bearish.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Even having been at the event and even having, you know, I didn't get to use it because they were all running the demo software, but I did get to at least try one on.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  I've always been ambivalent. Like, tell me more. Like, I need to know more about this before I can even decide either way.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  But to me, I still feel that way. That's why, ultimately, I still feel like they're probably going to have another event before it comes out.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  And, you know, if the other rumors are right and they're going to do like a bigger iPad that would make sense to do it all in one event.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  And so there's a new thing, which is a bigger, you know, pro sized 11 inch or 12 inch iPad.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  So here's a new thing and here is more on this thing we announced in September, the Apple Watch, which is now imminent. And let us show you more.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  That to me feels like they don't even need to do anymore. That's a perfect Apple event. A new iPad, a new size, you know, and if the thing about the stylus is right, there's all sorts of demos they can do there, you know, bring up somebody some third party with, you know,
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  to show some kind of way, calm style, professional artwork being drawn on the thing. And then, you know, show me more about the Apple Watch.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  The thing that gets me is the confidence that Apple seems to have about the Watch. It's not what they've told us.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And what you can read at apple.com slash watch, it's the confidence that Tim Cook has and everybody else who's spoken about it publicly. They're so confident about it that to me, it's, it, it, it seems like it would be reckless to bet against it.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  Because they're not, they're not the type of people who breathlessly promote everything and anything that they do.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  I agree with you, definitely. I think that that is something that makes it so you can't obviously, you can't write it off.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  You could never write it off being from Apple these days. But their confidence is pretty fascinating. The way that they're positioning it, they're obviously still doing this like world tour of going around and talking to all the various people in the fashion industry, hiring the various people in the fashion industry to bring them in to make sure that they're ready to go for this.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  It all adds to sort of the feeling I'm getting. But I also just am starting to get a better sense of what I think that they think they can do with it.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  I do think that the early days will be maybe a little bit underwhelming at first because they're only going to work with, you know, a handful of people as they always do behind the scenes to get third party apps sort of ready to go
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  for when this thing launches and they're going to be obvious things and it'll be largely predicated around push notifications, I would assume.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  But I am starting to believe more that there's different types of things that third party developers will be able to accomplish.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  And maybe it takes to the second SDK, the more robust thing for it to really get there.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  But, you know, I'm reminded back to when the iPhone first came out and, you know, we had sort of developers making the web apps because they didn't have access to actually making native apps the time only Apple did.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  So it's not exactly what's going on here, but we are getting a little bit of what feels like a muted SDK for third party developers right now.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  I think it's somewhat analogous. I think it's a little bit better than the web apps of 2007, but it's close. It's not a bad analogy.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  I agree. And so now I'm trying to think through, you know, when Apple did release the second sort of SDK for the iPhone that allowed for native app development, it was insanely exciting to everyone, but no one really knew what would happen.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  We knew games would come and there would be sort of silly little apps to begin with, which there were, there were, you know, many.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  And then it wasn't clear if there would ever be like big businesses, right, real businesses built on top of that. And look at it now.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  I mean, how many, how many billion dollar businesses have been built on top of the iPhone alone, you know, and Android and stuff.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  But the iPhone is what kicked it off. It's like Instagram and all these other things that were, you know, iOS only at the time.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  And is there a way, this is what I'm trying to think through, is there a way for the watch to do something similar.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  You're instinct is that sounds ridiculous, right? Like that, that there's, that there's this watch, the small little device that's, that just seems like more of a novelty, or is it going to actually be something that big businesses can be built on.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  And I think that there's two camps, there's, there's people who believe that eventually we will get to that place and there can be sort of new, new interactive paradigms with like sort of the, the tactic feedback stuff and there will be new types of messaging apps that we haven't thought of yet.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  But then there's the other group that I think is more along the lines of, look, the Apple Watch, here's what it is.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  It's just another moat for the iPhone. It's a way, you can't use it right now without the iPhone. It's a paired device with that. And so it makes the iPhone more attractive to iPhone owners.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  And it makes, it gives people maybe another reason to buy an iPhone rather than choosing an Android device or some other similar device.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  Yeah, I, I, I don't know, I feel like both of those scenarios are possible. I do feel like ultimately it's, you know, just the march of technology is that eventually it will be independent.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  Like it won't need, you know, it'll have its own internet access without an iPhone.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  Right. Just to me exactly the way that the iPhone used to need a Mac or PC running iTunes to sync. I mean it seems crazy. Like it was the only way to get contacts on your iPhone was to sync your computer using a cable.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  And I kind of feel like the watch needing a phone within Bluetooth range to get internet is the same thing. Like, you know, three, four, five years from now we're going to laugh at the fact that you couldn't get text messages on your phone unless you were within, you know, 20 feet of your, or on your watch unless you were within 20 feet of your phone.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  But in the meantime, I do feel like that's the way that you bootstrap it is that it's again, like you said, like a moat around the iPhone. I think that's how it debuts. And then all of a sudden you realize it's, you know, two, three, four years from now it's its own thing.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  That's right. I agree with that. And I think, I think they're going about it the right way with everything that they've sort of shown so far, you know, having used a lot of these other sort of wearable devices, they're all, they all range from either very bad to sort of just mediocre.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  There's no great one right now. And I think a lot of it is that a lot of, a lot of these companies have just basically taken the phone paradigm, the smartphone, the touch screen paradigm and strapped it on the wrist and Apple with this crown sort of interaction. They're trying to actually think about what they should do. I mean, you're putting your, when you're touching the screen all the time, you're completely covering the screen. Like, why would you do that? You know, so like the crown where you can zoom in and out that, that's like sort of.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Like sort of is an obvious thing in hindsight that I think is going to be sort of a killer feature that everyone ends up copying, of course, but it's things like that that make me more excited about, you know, the prospects for it, though I agree with sort of everything we're saying, which is that the first iteration, it will take a while to prove these things up.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Yeah, I think that the crown in particular is one of the reasons why, why did they announce it when they announced it? Well, part of it is like, I wrote, I wrote this week that part of it, I think is that they wanted to announce it before it went into production because once it went into production, it was inevitably going to leak. And in fact, did leak.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  There was, like one day before they announced it, there actually were like blueprints that leaked that were, you know, in hindsight were pretty much spot on or exactly spot on.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  They didn't get a lot of publicity because they weren't real pictures, but if it had happened even a week earlier somebody, you know, could have done like a 3D rendering and spoiled it.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  I think they really wanted to be the ones to unveil it and they're glad they did. Six months is about the outer limit, I think for when Apple could do it.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  I think it's also possible that in like an ideal world, if everything had gone according to plan, maybe it wouldn't be shipping in April, maybe it would have been shipping like in February.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  Yeah, just, you know, enough bugs still remain enough kinks still remain in software that they need the extra two months before they feel comfortable shipping.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  But well, it also, I definitely heard that they did want to do this in the fall and it just, oh, originally, yeah, definitely.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  Yeah, like, and in hindsight with some of Tim Cook's remarks, like all things D or whatever, you know, I think the year before that they, you know, they have a, they have products to release all throughout 2014. Yeah, I think like two years ago, they were thinking like a holiday release for 2014.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  So I think it's, I think that's definitely the case. I've heard the same thing too, like internally that it's, you know, not that they're shocked.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I don't think it's like a disaster. I just think it's, yeah, it just, it just was not the best case scenario.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  Yeah, there's soft. I think it's largely software rather than the hardware that's going on.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  It's a software's hard to nail this, this new sort of paradigm that they're trying to do.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Yeah, I think that the hardware that they, and who knows, I mean, because, you know, it's not like they were letting us crack open the demo units back in September, but I'm pretty sure that the hardware they showed us at the event in September.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Is exactly the hardware that it is. I think I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  Yeah. And that they're like internally, like Johnny Ives team is already working on the next revision of the hardware.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  Like they've, you know, the hardware is done and defined and, you know, it's that screen and that chip and that metal and, you know, everything down to the bands that that stuff is all done.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Yeah, I think it's all software that's still being worked on. And, of course, the component of that is the battery life.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  And what do you think about sort of, I'm sure you saw the Mark Gurman report about the breakdown of the battery life issue. And so it's, you know, I think it was 2.5 hours of full active usage, which is a little bit, you know, misleading because are you going to be sitting there on your watch for two, two and a half straight hours,
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  using it straight through no, but what do you say, is that like in the ballpark you thought it would get to?
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Yeah, I think that the basic gist is that they need to make it so that if you're an act, if you use your Apple Watch thoroughly that you can still get through a day, no problem.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  I've seen some stuff, you know, the demo units they showed us and all the screenshots they show us don't show a battery meter all the time.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  And the simulator in Xcode does. So there's some question as to whether, you know, where they've, you know, what are the actual production ones going to do.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  How are you going to check the battery? Like it seems as though what they've shown us so far is that you're not supposed to even, I'm sure there's some way to do it, like go into settings and there's, you know, if you really want to check your battery, they'll be away.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  I feel like what they want to do is just get it so that it, you know, if you charge it every night, you'll be fine and you don't have to worry about it.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  And if you forget to charge it one night, you're probably going to, it's probably going to die the next day.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  And you know, one thing, so as we know with the phones now and iPad and everything else, like the biggest draw a power draw is the screen of all these things.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  And I think that it seems like they're doing smart things with that the other other sort of smart watchmakers haven't done by the way, which is when you get sort of notifications coming in rather than illuminate the screen right away, they're using their haptic thing, the haptic engine to be able to alert you to that.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  So the screen is going to be on probably less than you think it is because we all see these smart watches out there right now that light up whenever you get something and that's not going to be the case with this.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  I mentioned last week when Ben Thompson was on the show that from what I've heard from a couple people again, not firsthand, not anybody who has a watch, but all second hand from people who've talked to people who are testing a watch is that an enormous amount of effort has gone into making it so that when you do want to
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  look at the screen, it comes right on like the detection of your wrist and the motion detection of what angle the watch is at. Hey, I bet this, you know, the person wants to look at me right now. And then when you move it away, it goes off that they've, you know, an enormous amount of work over the last three years has gone into just turning the screen on and off when it wants to be on and off.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  I feel like the german stuff is interesting. It's, you know, I have no reason to doubt that those are the actual numbers. I just feel though that it's like, it almost doesn't, it isn't really helpful to thinking about how you're going to use the watch.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  It's just sort of their enumerating.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  That's right. I'm 100% in agreement with that. It's sort of, it's thinking it's, it's, yes, it's sort of the spec sheet. It's what it will be like if you were just in a, in a vacuum.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  If you just said like, give me the numbers of what it's going to do when it's like this and this. But I think the key is that the way that it's been engineered that the Apple Watch will change the way that people at least right now think that they're going to use it.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  It's not going to be all the time coming on and it's not going to be, you have a hard time, you know, turning the screen off or you have to hit a button to turn the screen on and off and all that kind of stuff. And so, yeah, it will end up lasting a lot longer than people are sort of thinking about just reading that, that, that stat line.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Yeah, the polar opposite to me would be the, the now defunct iPod Nano or whatever. It was called the one that was square.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  And then there was the, I think it was called the watch hands. Yeah, the TikTok kick card. Yep, start.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Yep, I got it right. I did too, which I think at the time was like the broke the record for like a starter project and it really was well done.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  It was as well done as a turn your iPod Nano into a watch could be done, I think. But I got it, I popped my iPod into it and, you know, five minutes later took it off and never used it again because the idea of a watch that you had to hit a button to read, drove me nuts.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  It was, you know, because you had, you know, there was no motion detection because the iPod wasn't meant for that. So you, you know, to see the time or do anything with it, you had to use your other hand and hit the button.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  And it's funny.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  It was, you know, and I, you know, I could see why some people liked it, but for me as somebody who wears a watch and just wants to glance at the time it was maddening.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And I feel like the Apple watch is the opposite of that.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And that sort of also leads to one last thing. I know we've been going for a while, but I don't know when we'll talk again. So I want to, there's, so with that, you know, you also had, if you wanted to listen to music, which is what you do, of course, mainly with an iPod, you had to have, you know, your, your white earbuds plugged into your wrist and then they would be going up to your ears, right?
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  And it's like, if you're trying to run, you could, you know, rip the earbuds out of your ears if you were, for some reason, you know, moving your arms too far or something.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  That leads to a question which I have no idea, but I, and I don't know if they're going to do this anytime soon, or if this waits till sort of the fall or the next version or something, but like, they have to be doing something with Bluetooth earbuds, right?
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  I mean, there's no way that they can, they're, they're already saying that you'll be able to store music and, and some podcasts and they'll, it'll have limited storage to be able to do that.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And they want you to be running with it and, and you can have sort of, you know, be able to listen to your music.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  And they're saying, I think they said in the press material or whatever, you can use, you know, your Bluetooth, you know, running people have special running Bluetooth headsets that they already use in their distance or whatever, but that's not going to be good enough for Apple.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  They're going to want to do their own, right? And when are they going to do that?
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  Yeah, it's a, it's a perfect, it has to happen eventually idea.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  And, and again, I think having used the iPod Nano with the TikTok watch strap, I had the exact same thing.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  I thought, well, when I, when I sent it for the Kickstarter, I thought, I'm probably not going to like this as a watch because I'm not going to like a watch that I have to hit a button to see.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  But I might like it as something to use my iPod when I go running.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  And in fact, I hated it because of exactly what you said that having the cable go to my wrist and my arm is moving while you run, it was maddening.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  It was, it just felt like like I was like, I don't know.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  It felt like the sort of thing that you, you know, like like, like when you're on probation and they put like a, right.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  But I can't help but feel the same thing with the Apple watch.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  I mean, the watch clearly doesn't even have a headphone jack.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  So it's, I, you know, it's going to, and it does do Bluetooth audio.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  So if the watch does Bluetooth audio and the future is to not have a cable between your headphones and your device period,
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  Apple has to do Bluetooth.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  My question though is if Apple goes and does Bluetooth headphones of their own, are they going to be included with devices or?
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  Yeah, interesting.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  And or if they're not, will they do them themselves or will it be like a Beats thing?
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Well, so remember how they used to have, I think they still probably sell them.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  They had those more high end version of any ear, ear buds because I bought them at one point.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  I remember that one for the other ones.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And they were pretty good.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  They were okay.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  They had like three different sort of sizes that that you got the earbud gel things that you could sort of stick in your ears depending on how big your ears are.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  And they were okay.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  They were definitely better than the old version of the ear buds that came with all the iPods and everything.
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  I don't think they're better than the new version of the ear buds, at least I don't use those higher end versions.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  I'm not even sure if they sell them.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  They still do, but I would imagine that's how they do it at first, at least that they sell them as like because it'll probably be expensive to make more expensive than the current iteration.
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  So maybe they sell them for those $100.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  And then eventually they sort of move towards that because that is something I always think about, you know, like what else can they do to improve the iPhones right now?
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  And the biggest pain point now is honestly untangling the damn ear buds when they're in my pocket.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  I know that they're like, you know, everyone, I complain about this from time to time on Twitter and everyone comes at me with like you should get these ties or you know this thing and they have all these like third party products to like make it better.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  But like really I just want, I don't want to carry around more stuff.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  I just want to have my ear buds and I want to have the phone in my pocket and I want the ear buds not to somehow defy the laws of physics and get so tangled up that it seems like you have to cut them almost to in order to untangle them.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  And so it's another thing that really strikes me in the winter too because it's so much more of a pain in the ass when you're wearing a coat.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  And yeah, and you've got these things dangling and it's like when do you, there's no good way to do it.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  Like if you, you know, want to listen to podcasts like I, you know, I walk almost everywhere in the city and I run errands and that's when I listen to podcasts and it's great.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  But when it's winter and I have to wear a coat it's like what do I do do I put it in my pocket and start listening to podcasts and put the coat over the headphones and then it like it pulls.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  But if you put the coat on first and string it over the coat it there's just no good way with the cable like as opposed to when you're not wearing a coat you can just put your phone in a pocket and it's not too much of a hindrance to have the headphone cable going from your jeans pocket to your ears.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  Put a winter coat on and there's no good way to do it. Have you, have you tried one of the Bluetooth ones before?
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  So it's like funny, you know, I going back into the late 90s and whatever when they first came out.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Obviously they sort of got this douchey, you know, sort of aura around them.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  But I use the, I use the jawbone era. I think it's called, yeah, the era quite often now.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  The problem is that it's only obviously one year. So it's not great for music. You can do it for music.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  But for podcasts and stuff, it's pretty good. It's the only other downside is with one ear.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  It's, you have to turn it up quite high sometimes like if you're in a, in a loud or environment to be able to hear.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  And I never use it for calling or anything, but I don't honestly don't make them any calls.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  So I don't use a speaker part, but I use it a lot as a, just to listen to things.
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  It's a little bit wonky. The jawbone software isn't great.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  And so it can take a little while to pair and sometimes it drops and it's grit not great audio quality.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  I would say, but it's good for podcasts. Definitely.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Yeah, I would probably enjoy that if I had one, but I've never tried it.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Yeah, I, you know, I haven't tried any of the others, but the jawbone one is, is pretty solid.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  I kind of wonder what the form factor would be for like an Apple Bluetooth headset.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  Like, you know, would, would, would they be connected somehow?
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  And if so, what would it be like a thing that goes around the back of your head?
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  Hmm. Yeah, that's an interesting point there.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  I have seen both. I've seen ones that are like that where they have a thing that goes around the back of your head.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  I think they've also seen one where they still have something like dangling, but it's not connected, you know?
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Right, because someone just got to be a battery.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  So it can't be, it can't just be the earpieces, you know, like ideally it would just be two earpieces that you put in in the pack.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  But then you need two batteries and they'd be one of the reasons why I think the jawbone one is sort of bigger than it even needs to be.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And the battery is not great by the way either. That thing lasts for, it says four hours of talk time.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  I think it's, it's usually like two and a half hours max it will last.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  Yeah, I feel like that's, it's got to happen, but I don't have, I have no idea how it's going to happen.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  I feel like the tooth has, you know, the headphone cables have got to go the way to the dodo.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  And the other thing too, that's got to be a motivation for Apple is just staring at my iPhone 6 right now.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  I can't help but look at it and think that the headphone jack has now a gating factor on making it.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  That's the biggest part. Yeah.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  You know, the, the lightning adapter is so much thinner than the headphone jack.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  And I, whatever, whatever the, whatever the thickest port is on your device is going to be the next one Apple gets rid of.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  And right now it's the headphone jack.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Well, and, and obviously they're starting, I think pretty soon, I think they have a few already, but they, there was some story that they're going to start shipping the lightning ones, right?
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  So you'll be able to do audio through the lightning port.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And so I'd imagine that's how they do it.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  Maybe even starting next year or something that they, they just sort of get rid of the, the headphone jack.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  And, and my God, I can't wait for people to complain about that.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  That will be, you know, that's going to be the next getting rid of the optical drive and, you know, killing the mouse and all these types of things.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  When they kill that audio, that headphone jack, it's going to be, it's going to be a shit story.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  And people are going to say it's because they own beats and beats.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  That's right.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  That's right.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  It's, yeah.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  It's all, we'll have an antitrust investigation, you know, like, it's all, it's, it's all a scheme to get you to buy beat headphones.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Right.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  But that, I would assume that that's what they're going to do.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  It seems like only natural because you can actually drop, you can draw power from that too, which is pretty interesting, right?
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  So you could have a pair of headphones that are connected still, but, you know, like the noise canceling ones.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Where right now you need like triple A batteries, but the, I had like the bose ones.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  Right.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  That, that, that cancel out the noise, but they need triple A batteries to put in them.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And if you could just draw the power from the phone, that's interesting, but that doesn't alleviate the, that actually probably exacerbates the, the core tissue still.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Probably.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  Well, it would have to.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  And then the other thing, I was thinking like, because noise cancel, whatever I think a noise canceling one, I used, I used to have a pair of bose noise, noise canceling.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  And I do, I kind of miss them whenever I'm on a plane because they really do work.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  And I always think of them as something you wear on a plane.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  But they're just so bulky.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Exactly.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  It's, it's such a huge, they're so big compared to earbuds.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Yep.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  And if they drew power, that's the other thing too, is that, you know, you don't want to get a plane and have your phone be dead because you're
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  your phone be dead because you were powering your head, your headphones.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And if you've, there's only one lightning adapter.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  So even if you're on a plane, depending on your airline, if you have a, you're lucky enough to be on a plane where you can have a power port.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Right.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  You can't charge it while you're, while you're using it for lightning to do the headphones.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  I feel like Bluetooth is the way to go.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  The only way that that would trade off would be good there is if, um, is if by drawing power from the phone, you could significantly
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  reduce the bulk of the noise canceling.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  So they didn't need the battery, obviously.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  Uh, I don't know.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  I don't know what's involved in sort of the noise canceling technology.
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  But I cannot help but think that the headphone jack is going the way of the dodo.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  I mean, I, I mean, really, I honestly don't know how much thinner they could make the device and still have it.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  I mean, a little bit.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  Just looking at it.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  But it's really cool.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  And then could they, could they do stereo speakers then?
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Do you think on the, uh, you know, at the bottom where they only have the one sort of side is, uh, is the speaker.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  Could they do both, would they do both?
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Does that matter?
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  I don't know.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  I feel like I've never gotten a definitive answer on that.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  But when I've brought it up with people at Apple, they've always said that it's a gimmick because it's too close.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  It doesn't make it.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  It actually doesn't.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  Yeah.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  That's right.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  I've heard the same thing.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  It's sort of, it wouldn't matter.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  You're exactly right.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  I think it might matter a little bit.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  And I've seen some phone, you know, like with Android, you can find a phone that does anything.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  You know, there's some obscure Sony one that has like speaker on the top and the bottom.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Right.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  So right.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  When you hold the phone in horizontal mode, like you would when you're watching the video, there's a little bit more separation.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  And I could see it would make a difference.
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  But for the most part, you know, if you have stereo speakers on the bottom, just on one side of the phone, it's pointless.
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  And in fact, when you're watching video sideways, it's counterproductive.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  Right.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  You know, what's the point of having left and right when they're both on the right, because that's how you're holding the phone?
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Like it's, you know, so that's what I've heard, is that it's just a stupid marketing checkpoint that they're not going to go for.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  That was one of the rumored features though of the iPad Pro, right, that it might have stereo, like because it would have speakers on both sides, who knows if that's that figured end up being legitimate at all.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  But I think that was at one point, like a thought.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  I still think though it only makes sense if they were at the top and bottom, not left and right, because that's how you watch video.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  And videos, or when you want it, like who cares if you're alert sounds come in stereo.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  That's right.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  Or what they could do, if they do actually do as some sort of keyboard device with the iPad, iPad Pro, maybe they could do it just like they do with MacBooks now where they have the speaker sort of builts under the keyboard.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Yeah, something like that I could see.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  I don't know, but I don't think putting them on the actual sides of the device makes any sense.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Yeah.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  All right, I think that about does it good talking to you.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  It shouldn't make it so long this next time.
