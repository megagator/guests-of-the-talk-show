[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  Jason Snell, you know what, this is the first time in two and a half
[00:03.840 --> 00:07.840]  years that I've been able to say to a guest on this show, boy, it
[00:07.840 --> 00:08.920]  was good to see you recently.
[00:10.080 --> 00:15.320]  Yeah, it was good to see you in person for the first time since I want to say
[00:16.200 --> 00:20.680]  probably maybe the fall of, of 2019.
[00:20.720 --> 00:22.800]  I don't, I don't know that I may, I can't remember.
[00:22.800 --> 00:25.920]  I'd have to look at my notes, but I know that I, we were, we were
[00:25.920 --> 00:30.680]  both at the Mac book pro briefings, I believe in the, in New York, in the
[00:30.680 --> 00:33.500]  fall of 2019, which was my last apple briefing.
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.080]  I'm not sure if we were at the same time.
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.560]  Yeah, we were, I was there for in New York for that, but I missed the
[00:40.560 --> 00:47.020]  September iPhone one in 2019 with yet another can't get on an airplane eye
[00:47.020 --> 00:51.360]  surgery in August, so otherwise it would have been three years ago.
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.080]  WWDC 2019 yeah, and why, why were you in New York for that one?
[00:57.620 --> 00:59.500]  Because that was where the briefing was.
[01:00.100 --> 01:03.640]  I've had a couple of those where I get a call from apple that says, I think
[01:03.640 --> 01:07.400]  that one, it was even, we're going to have you in Cupertino on a Tuesday.
[01:07.580 --> 01:08.660]  And I was like, okay.
[01:08.760 --> 01:11.980]  And then they called back and said, actually, we're going to have you in
[01:12.080 --> 01:15.560]  Tribeca on a Monday and I'm like, okay.
[01:15.560 --> 01:18.860]  And so then I had to make like plane reservations and hotel reservations and
[01:18.860 --> 01:23.480]  stuff, but they've done a couple events where they, I think it's tied to the fact
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.200]  that they do we've done some interviews with them for upgrade and the people who
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.320]  they wanted to have as the interviewee, they offered somebody and said, this is
[01:32.320 --> 01:36.560]  a product manager, we can have them on your podcast, but you, they're going to
[01:36.560 --> 01:39.280]  be in New York, so you have to come to New York because they usually do like a
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.380]  secondary set of interviews and briefings in, in Cupertino, but in this
[01:43.380 --> 01:46.360]  case, the interview we was in New York.
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.680]  So we went to New York.
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.480]  I don't know why I have deep sympathy for you having to go to New York, but
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.800]  don't sympathize with myself for going to California all the time.
[01:56.800 --> 01:57.840]  We're going to California.
[01:57.840 --> 01:58.160]  Yeah.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.560]  Yeah, it is, it is weird.
[02:00.560 --> 02:02.200]  I will say having events out here.
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.000]  It's kind of funny cause yeah, everybody I know comes out in there in the hotel
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.760]  rooms and stuff like that, and I'm schlepping up and down from, from home.
[02:09.760 --> 02:13.200]  And it's just a different feeling when you're at home and there's a thing going
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.680]  on, then when you're kind of all in on travel and you know, you're not, you're
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.280]  not at home and it's just a different kind of feeling, but, but yeah, I, I, they,
[02:23.280 --> 02:29.600]  they announced WWDC for media 13 days in advance and obviously flights are very
[02:29.600 --> 02:32.360]  expensive and you got to get a hotel and all those things.
[02:32.680 --> 02:36.000]  And I was talking to all my friends about all the logistics about all this stuff.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.960]  And then I thought, Oh yeah, I just, I'm going to drive down.
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.800]  Like, it's just not, I, I am, they're not many of my peers in doing what we
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.280]  do, who actually are in the Bay area.
[02:47.600 --> 02:52.400]  And so it's a, it's kind of a funny, it's a funny thing where I feel kind of bad.
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.840]  Cause it's like, it's really easy for me.
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.480]  I talked to Apple PR people and they're like, we're going to do this briefing.
[02:56.480 --> 02:58.480]  Cooper T and I'm like, okay, two 80, it's fine.
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.040]  I can drive down.
[02:59.440 --> 02:59.840]  It's okay.
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.760]  It's I, I, I, I do want to talk about the meta aspects of getting back to normalcy,
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.800]  but one of them is I've completely, not completely, but almost completely lost
[03:10.800 --> 03:13.120]  my ability to function outside the home.
[03:13.760 --> 03:16.240]  Like, not that I don't leave the home.
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.360]  I think that I've been, especially, you know, for me in my family, it's been a
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.400]  very, very decisive line between being fully vaccinated and not, and once we
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.360]  got fully vaccinated in March of last year, we really stopped sheltering in
[03:31.360 --> 03:32.800]  place or whatever you want to call it.
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.480]  But that said, we took some vacations last summer, but vacations aside, work
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.920]  travel has always been sort of, well, a limited it's an only started to creep
[03:43.920 --> 03:46.720]  back up in a few weeks before WWDC.
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.280]  There new Apple had a briefing for Friday night baseball in New York, which was
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.120]  nice, but it's not even a day trip for me.
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.520]  It's like an afternoon trip, you know, it's a 90 minute train ride up, go to the
[03:59.520 --> 04:04.080]  meeting, 90 minute train ride back to Philly and I'm home for dinner.
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.040]  So it still feels like I'm somewhat tethered to home.
[04:07.760 --> 04:13.840]  I really, I should have booked my air travel to WWDC many more weeks in
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.160]  advance than before Apple made it official, which I do, I didn't realize I
[04:18.160 --> 04:19.200]  do in most years.
[04:19.200 --> 04:23.280]  I take a good guess as to when WWDC is going to be, even if they haven't
[04:23.280 --> 04:27.280]  announced dates yet, and it seemed pretty clear that it was going to be
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.520]  June 7th or whatever it actually was, my guess would have been correct and I
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.120]  would have got direct flights, but because I waited until it was official,
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.920]  I only had indirect flights and it was sort of a disaster.
[04:39.920 --> 04:44.400]  It's exactly, it reiterates why I go out of my way to only take nonstop flights.
[04:45.440 --> 04:46.400]  I was supposed to fly.
[04:46.400 --> 04:50.560]  I did have the foresight to go out on Saturday instead of Sunday.
[04:50.560 --> 04:53.520]  Oh, usually I fly in on a Sunday if it's a Monday keynote, you know, the day
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.360]  before, and I, you know, just take a morning-ish flight from the East Coast
[04:57.360 --> 05:00.320]  and figure if something goes wrong, if there's a delay or whatever, I'll
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.840]  just get in late.
[05:01.840 --> 05:04.560]  But I thought, you know, everybody's saying all these flights are getting
[05:04.560 --> 05:07.600]  canceled, maybe I should go on Saturday just in case.
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.280]  And it turned out like 20 minutes before my flight, I was supposed to go
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.040]  Philly to Chicago, Chicago to SFO, 20 minutes before my flight was supposed
[05:15.040 --> 05:19.680]  to start boarding, it just went from on time to canceled.
[05:19.680 --> 05:24.560]  Just wasn't delayed.
[05:24.560 --> 05:25.280]  It was on time.
[05:25.920 --> 05:30.160]  I'd just gone through security where there was nobody and my, I got a
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.000]  notification on the phone that, and I had my phone out to go through security
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.440]  and use the boarding pass on the phone.
[05:35.440 --> 05:36.320]  So I knew it was fine.
[05:37.440 --> 05:41.760]  90 seconds later, canceled and quickly scrambled to an American desk,
[05:41.760 --> 05:44.240]  rebooked four hours later that day.
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.680]  So I did still get there on Saturday, but I didn't get into like, I don't
[05:47.680 --> 05:49.840]  know, like 1130 at night Pacific time.
[05:49.840 --> 05:54.160]  It was a very long day and very close to, to being a day late, you know,
[05:54.160 --> 05:56.080]  it was very close to, you know what?
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.040]  You better go tomorrow.
[05:57.600 --> 06:00.480]  But yeah, that's the, that's the world we live in.
[06:00.480 --> 06:01.200]  I mean, it's good.
[06:01.200 --> 06:01.680]  We got there.
[06:01.680 --> 06:02.640]  I I'm with you.
[06:02.640 --> 06:05.120]  I did not have, I'm really out of practice.
[06:05.120 --> 06:08.000]  It was interesting seeing people, but I had that moment where I'm like,
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.680]  Oh yes, I need to be interacting with humans and looking them in the eye.
[06:11.680 --> 06:18.560]  And it was because I, I, my wife go work as a librarian.
[06:18.560 --> 06:20.800]  She goes to the library every day and works with the public.
[06:20.800 --> 06:22.400]  My son just finished high school.
[06:22.400 --> 06:25.440]  So he was going to high school every day and dealing with all the high school stuff.
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.840]  I work in my garage.
[06:27.840 --> 06:33.200]  So I, even before the pandemic, I was a little bit of a shut-in and then
[06:33.200 --> 06:35.360]  the pandemic just kind of magnified that.
[06:35.360 --> 06:39.040]  And so I am way out of practice with seeing other human beings.
[06:39.040 --> 06:43.040]  I had a, I had a, just a doctor's appointment check up yesterday and then
[06:43.040 --> 06:47.360]  went and, and went to the, the local liquor store, basically, and bought
[06:47.360 --> 06:48.960]  some beer because we were out of beer.
[06:48.960 --> 06:53.200]  And I, I, I thought to myself, it's like, how many times have I made
[06:53.200 --> 06:58.080]  multi-stops for anything outside the house in the last three years?
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.240]  And the answer is not very many times.
[07:00.240 --> 07:03.840]  I just don't, so I'm trying to do it more, but it is, it is being back
[07:03.840 --> 07:08.800]  in that social atmosphere of an Apple event was a real, it was a kick, but
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.600]  it was also a reminder of how long it has been since we've had anything
[07:13.600 --> 07:14.160]  like that.
[07:14.160 --> 07:18.880]  I, one thing I noticed the whole time out there was I've really lost my
[07:18.880 --> 07:22.160]  ability to keep track of more than two items at once.
[07:22.160 --> 07:27.280]  I, and I'm not really a leave person, a leave stuff behind person, you
[07:27.280 --> 07:31.360]  know, like, but during the keynote, I almost left my jacket at my seat
[07:31.360 --> 07:33.920]  and some kind of person was like, Hey, is this your jacket?
[07:33.920 --> 07:37.920]  And as I was about to wander over to the Steve Jobs theater where the
[07:37.920 --> 07:41.040]  hands-on area for the media was, I was like, yes, that is my jacket
[07:41.680 --> 07:43.680]  because it was hot and sunny.
[07:44.320 --> 07:46.880]  And so I took my jacket off, you know, I was in the shade.
[07:46.880 --> 07:49.120]  It gets, you know, and it wasn't like I had a lot of stuff.
[07:49.120 --> 07:55.040]  I just had like a water bottle and my bag with my laptop and notebook
[07:55.040 --> 07:55.600]  in it.
[07:55.600 --> 07:56.800]  And that was enough though.
[07:56.800 --> 07:59.280]  I had the water bottle, had the bag, left the jacket.
[07:59.280 --> 08:04.240]  And I found myself nearly doing that at every step of the way as I went
[08:04.240 --> 08:04.640]  about.
[08:04.640 --> 08:08.240]  Like if I couldn't have it in, I had like one thing in my left hand,
[08:08.240 --> 08:10.240]  one thing in my right hand and anything else.
[08:10.240 --> 08:11.440]  Couldn't remember it.
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.080]  Very strange.
[08:13.680 --> 08:16.000]  Yeah, well, you get out of habit of all of that stuff.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.960]  I had that the exact same thing, which is like, you know, I'm walking
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.440]  over here.
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.720]  I'm going to go see these people.
[08:20.720 --> 08:23.360]  I'm going to, you know, I've got to make sure that I've got the stuff
[08:23.360 --> 08:23.840]  with me.
[08:23.840 --> 08:27.600]  And do I have packing for the, for the day was also like, like, what do
[08:27.600 --> 08:29.920]  I need and what do I not need?
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.360]  And it was all just like, I know how to do this, but I'm way out of
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.360]  practice and, and these are not little scripts that I've been running
[08:37.360 --> 08:38.720]  in my head all this time.
[08:38.720 --> 08:40.000]  And so I've got to get back to it.
[08:40.000 --> 08:40.400]  I did.
[08:40.400 --> 08:42.160]  I did have one funny thing that I want to share.
[08:42.160 --> 08:44.480]  And I know Apple doesn't love a lot of the inside baseball stuff, but
[08:44.480 --> 08:46.800]  this is, this is little, and it's a little fun.
[08:46.800 --> 08:50.400]  You know, they don't like the magic is don't talk about PR, but I did
[08:50.400 --> 08:53.280]  have a funny moment where they did a bunch of briefings and I saw you
[08:53.280 --> 08:55.760]  there and chatted with you at the Steve Jobs theater where they have a
[08:55.760 --> 08:56.560]  briefing center.
[08:56.560 --> 08:58.880]  They built it there, even though the event wasn't at the theater, the
[08:58.880 --> 09:00.080]  briefings were there.
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.400]  And I got a text from Apple PR person saying, Jason, can you come to the
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.920]  entrance to Apple park?
[09:05.920 --> 09:07.360]  So I can take you to your briefing.
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.120]  And I texted her and I said, I'm sitting in the, in the Steve Jobs
[09:11.120 --> 09:11.520]  theater.
[09:12.320 --> 09:13.360]  Is this where I need to be?
[09:13.360 --> 09:15.280]  And she was like, Oh yeah, nevermind.
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.160]  And it was just a funny moment where they're also kind of getting up to
[09:18.160 --> 09:18.720]  speed on it.
[09:18.720 --> 09:21.200]  And they had, obviously they're, they have to usher you in.
[09:21.200 --> 09:24.080]  If you're outside of Apple park, they have to usher you in and vouch for
[09:24.080 --> 09:25.760]  you in order for you to get inside.
[09:25.760 --> 09:27.280]  And then they can send you to the theater.
[09:27.280 --> 09:28.560]  They walk you to the theater.
[09:28.560 --> 09:31.200]  And so I know why they did it that way, but it was just kind of funny
[09:31.200 --> 09:35.040]  because they, they didn't have it so wired that they like knew that I
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.720]  was already waiting for a different briefing and therefore didn't need
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.320]  to be sort of brought out and brought back in and it was just, you know,
[09:42.320 --> 09:43.200]  we're all getting up to speed.
[09:43.200 --> 09:44.400]  It was all dead briefings.
[09:44.400 --> 09:46.480]  It all went very well.
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.640]  I'd, you know, give Apple, I'd give them an a plus for everything that
[09:50.640 --> 09:52.720]  had to go right for this to work.
[09:52.720 --> 09:53.600]  Absolutely.
[09:53.600 --> 09:56.320]  They did such a good job and, and, you know, and everything to go right.
[09:56.320 --> 09:58.480]  I think I could be proven wrong.
[09:58.480 --> 10:01.680]  Maybe somebody at Apple would say something different, but my sense when
[10:01.680 --> 10:04.560]  I was there and before was.
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.240]  I don't think having people in the ring was ever part of the plan, right?
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.160]  Like the whole layout of the Steve jobs theater, you come in at
[10:14.160 --> 10:16.240]  Tantau Avenue to the entranceway.
[10:16.240 --> 10:19.680]  They're a little like guard station where that PR person wanted me to go.
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.960]  And you turn left to go to the Steve jobs theater and you turn right to
[10:22.960 --> 10:23.680]  go to the right.
[10:23.680 --> 10:28.320]  And so they built Steve jobs theater on the corner of the campus away from
[10:28.320 --> 10:32.800]  everything else and filled it with briefing rooms and the theater itself
[10:32.800 --> 10:35.040]  and the showcase area and all those things.
[10:35.040 --> 10:37.840]  It was built for these kinds of events.
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.040]  Then COVID happens and they're like, Oh, we really need to do it outside.
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.000]  Well, you know, we, we can't count on having a big indoor audience.
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.560]  And, and so they, to their credit, they said, you know what, let's, somebody
[10:48.560 --> 10:54.160]  said, it's okay to have civilians in the ring, or at least at the edge of the
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.200]  ring, we can do this at cafe max and put up a screen and we can show off our
[10:59.200 --> 11:00.080]  campus.
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.040]  And, and this is the funny thing is I don't think it was ever part of the
[11:03.040 --> 11:05.520]  original plan, but it was spectacular.
[11:05.520 --> 11:08.480]  It really, they, they carried it off really well.
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.400]  And that building is so amazing that to get us to like, I've never been anywhere
[11:14.400 --> 11:14.720]  near it.
[11:14.720 --> 11:17.920]  I've only ever turned left, gone to the Steve jobs theaters.
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.640]  So it, I don't think it was their plan, but it all worked out for them.
[11:22.640 --> 11:24.880]  It was kind of neat being inside.
[11:24.880 --> 11:26.080]  I've been close.
[11:26.080 --> 11:30.880]  There was an event a couple of years ago where I think it definitely involved a
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.840]  new Apple watch.
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.920]  I don't know if it was probably like 2019, maybe 2018, something like that.
[11:35.920 --> 11:41.920]  Where part of the media tour was to go to their fitness center, which is, I
[11:41.920 --> 11:43.120]  couldn't tell you on a map.
[11:43.120 --> 11:46.320]  I mean, I actually, I guess if you look at Apple maps, it would show you, but
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.440]  it's similarly, I think it's the opposite side of the camp of the square from the
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.360]  Steve jobs theater, but it is similarly in a corner, but they insisted on
[11:55.360 --> 11:56.960]  everybody taking golf carts.
[11:56.960 --> 11:58.240]  And I was like, I could walk in there.
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.120]  A couple other of us who were like, Hey, you know, we're from the East coast, you
[12:01.120 --> 12:02.720]  know, we're enjoying this weather.
[12:02.720 --> 12:03.520]  We can walk in there.
[12:03.520 --> 12:04.640]  Like, please take a cart.
[12:04.640 --> 12:05.840]  And it's like, okay, I get it.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.360]  You don't, you don't want us wandering around.
[12:08.400 --> 12:08.880]  I get it.
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.720]  It's not really for our wear and tear on our shoes.
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.800]  It is, you don't want us wandering around.
[12:14.800 --> 12:15.360]  So, okay.
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.320]  I'll take it.
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.040]  But at some point that it took us right by the main ring building.
[12:21.040 --> 12:24.640]  And so I was like on the pathway right around it and sort of saw the scope.
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.920]  I mean, that's the one thing I, I can only compare it to like Disney world and the
[12:29.920 --> 12:37.120]  way that Disney very famously plays perspective tricks to make things look
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.920]  bigger or smaller, like the main street and Disneyland and Disney world and the
[12:41.920 --> 12:45.600]  magic kingdom and all the other parks around the world.
[12:45.600 --> 12:52.480]  They, they make the second floor of the buildings smaller than the first floor,
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.280]  which makes, but, but use perspective tricks to make them seem normal size.
[12:57.280 --> 13:01.840]  So it looks to you like you're walking down a street of two story buildings, but
[13:01.840 --> 13:06.400]  they're really more like one and a half story high so that they don't interfere
[13:06.400 --> 13:09.840]  with the sight lines from other parts of the park and vice versa.
[13:09.840 --> 13:13.920]  They do tricks to make the castle in the center seem bigger than it really is,
[13:13.920 --> 13:14.880]  et cetera.
[13:14.880 --> 13:18.400]  I think that Apple very much has done the same thing with the ring building where
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.160]  it is a very humble appearance.
[13:22.720 --> 13:23.920]  It wouldn't make any sense.
[13:23.920 --> 13:27.360]  And I'm sure zoning wise, it just wouldn't even be allowed in Cupertino.
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.480]  It doesn't make any sense to build it as a skyscraper, which is what most single
[13:32.480 --> 13:37.120]  building corporate headquarters of the last, you know, a hundred plus years are
[13:37.120 --> 13:39.920]  like the Chrysler building, the Sears tower in Chicago.
[13:39.920 --> 13:43.280]  It doesn't make sense to build a skyscraper in Cupertino, but if you took
[13:43.280 --> 13:49.120]  the ring and just, you know, straightened it out and put it up end to end, it
[13:49.120 --> 13:51.280]  would be a very high skyscraper.
[13:51.280 --> 13:52.560]  It is a big building.
[13:52.560 --> 13:55.760]  You can kind of, you know, just do some simple math about square footage and
[13:55.760 --> 13:57.520]  think, wow, it is a big building.
[13:57.520 --> 14:00.720]  But when you see pictures of it, it just looks low to the ground.
[14:00.720 --> 14:02.960]  Very humble being next.
[14:02.960 --> 14:08.160]  Whatever your mental image is of the ring building, double it in size.
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.200]  Like that's how I felt.
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.280]  It's like, I thought I knew how big it was and I was not even remotely close.
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.000]  I couldn't believe it.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.840]  Like the area they had for the media to get coffee, Danish, water, whatever
[14:19.840 --> 14:24.720]  else before the keynote was on the second floor, but it took four flights
[14:24.720 --> 14:27.120]  of stairs to get there, right?
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.240]  It's like, well, that's because cafe max is open air.
[14:30.240 --> 14:33.920]  And so I think that there's like a floor that is not there for that.
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.880]  And then you're overlooking it, but it's yeah, it's a huge space.
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.720]  And then there's still more floors above.
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.640]  We were in like the little balcony, essentially overlooking cafe max for
[14:42.640 --> 14:42.880]  that.
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.560]  And it was all, and it's all like an Apple store.
[14:44.560 --> 14:45.520]  I mean, that's the, that's the thing.
[14:45.520 --> 14:48.800]  Like I expected this, but it's still, it's one thing to see it where it's
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.640]  like literally the stairs they've got the handrails just like at the Steve
[14:52.640 --> 14:55.120]  Jobs theater, they're incredible attention to detail.
[14:55.120 --> 14:57.520]  All the wood is that kind of light wood from the Apple store.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.280]  It's an enormous facility where every single bit of it, other than the
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.000]  elevator in the parking garage with the buttons that are misaligned, your
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.800]  favorite feature that when you're inside, it's all like super high
[15:06.800 --> 15:10.160]  attention to detail at every turn in around every corner.
[15:10.160 --> 15:12.480]  It is the world's largest Apple store.
[15:12.480 --> 15:13.280]  It's what it is.
[15:13.280 --> 15:13.760]  It's amazing.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.360]  Did you, I think cable Sasser, of course, who I actually ran into there,
[15:17.360 --> 15:21.520]  he was attending and it was so good to see him, but he had a Twitter thread
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.160]  about it that all the elevators in Apple park are there's like there's
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.840]  Otis and some other company in the U S that make like, I don't know,
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.600]  probably almost every elevator that's of use in the United States, but
[15:33.600 --> 15:37.760]  outside the U S especially in Asia, I think it's Mitsubishi who of course
[15:37.760 --> 15:39.200]  makes like everything.
[15:39.200 --> 15:41.920]  It's like a typical Japanese conglomerate where they make everything
[15:41.920 --> 15:44.240]  from like toasters to cars, to elevators.
[15:45.200 --> 15:48.400]  Apple of course got their elevators because they're generally regarded
[15:48.400 --> 15:50.480]  as the best elevators in the world.
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.160]  And one of the features that they have standard, it's not just special
[15:54.160 --> 15:56.720]  for Apple, but it's a mystery. I think it's Mitsubishi, but whatever
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.800]  the company is, if you press a button by accident and you didn't mean
[16:00.800 --> 16:04.720]  to go there, like, let's say you get in on ground floor one and you
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.320]  want to go to four, but you press three by accident.
[16:08.320 --> 16:10.560]  Well, in a U S elevator, guess what?
[16:10.560 --> 16:13.760]  The door is going to open on three you're stuck, but in a Mitsubishi
[16:13.760 --> 16:16.800]  elevator, if you press the button by accident, you can double press
[16:16.800 --> 16:18.800]  it and it'll, it'll unstick.
[16:19.440 --> 16:21.840]  It'll go away, which is a neat feature.
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.440]  They're also very smooth elevators and that's, they have like glass
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.000]  doors to show off. They look good, right?
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.960]  Like the, it's almost like the old see-through iMac from 1998.
[16:32.960 --> 16:34.720]  Like, Hey, the inside is so cool.
[16:34.720 --> 16:35.840]  We want to show it to you.
[16:35.840 --> 16:39.520]  It's like, you can kind of, it's like the here, you can see the wheels
[16:39.520 --> 16:42.160]  and the cables of the elevator system while you're waiting because
[16:42.160 --> 16:42.960]  they're so pretty.
[16:42.960 --> 16:48.800]  I also noticed that all of the buttons, the little signs, whatever
[16:48.800 --> 16:51.280]  legal stuff has to go inside an elevator.
[16:51.280 --> 16:53.280]  It's all typeset in San Francisco.
[16:53.920 --> 16:55.200]  Of course, of course it is.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.400]  That's, that's the thing is that that's what actually makes the
[16:58.400 --> 17:01.280]  weird misaligned thing in the sub-basement parking garage.
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.120]  So funny is like very clearly a line was drawn.
[17:05.120 --> 17:08.160]  That's like, we don't care beyond this point, but everything on the
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.080]  inside, they care so much about things that, that most companies
[17:12.080 --> 17:12.800]  wouldn't care about.
[17:12.800 --> 17:13.520]  And I know it's silly.
[17:13.520 --> 17:15.360]  I mean, it's just, it's a corporate facility.
[17:15.360 --> 17:18.400]  It is what it is, but they, they it's very Apple in its way.
[17:18.400 --> 17:20.000]  And I did have that moment when I was sitting there.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.240]  We've, we've all thought about how Apple park is sort of Steve
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.520]  Jobs's last product and, and Steve jobs and Johnny Ive's last
[17:27.520 --> 17:28.320]  collaboration.
[17:28.320 --> 17:30.640]  And I, I took a moment while I was thinking about it, be like,
[17:30.640 --> 17:31.760]  yeah, I can see it.
[17:31.760 --> 17:35.520]  Like it is, I'm glad we got that experience to go in there.
[17:35.520 --> 17:39.520]  Cause like I said, I'm not sure they ever really wanted outsiders,
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.720]  a large group of outsiders to be at Apple park, but I'm glad I
[17:44.720 --> 17:45.360]  got to see it.
[17:45.360 --> 17:49.120]  Cause it is a fascinating look into sort of like, not only this
[17:49.120 --> 17:51.840]  thing we talk about all the time, but also that the, into the,
[17:51.840 --> 17:54.400]  the last collaboration of, of Steve and Johnny.
[17:54.400 --> 17:57.040]  Yeah, because they really did build it from scratch.
[17:57.040 --> 18:00.160]  I mean, they just built a whole, bought a whole lot of land
[18:00.160 --> 18:02.560]  that I think all of, I don't know if all of it or most of it
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.800]  was previously owned by Hewlett Packard, but raised it, did
[18:06.800 --> 18:07.840]  all the landscaping.
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.880]  It is truly, you know, Disney ask in its control of everything
[18:12.880 --> 18:18.080]  from the sight lines to the, the, the greenery to just every
[18:18.080 --> 18:22.160]  aspect of it was designed and is, is the way it is for better
[18:22.160 --> 18:24.320]  or for worse by intention.
[18:24.880 --> 18:28.880]  And it, to me does give insight into the company's culture.
[18:28.880 --> 18:34.880]  It is a manifestation of the, the jobs, Ivy collaboration
[18:34.880 --> 18:38.880]  and the, the sort of state of the company when it was, when
[18:38.880 --> 18:39.760]  it was constructed.
[18:41.120 --> 18:43.280]  And I would say one of the things you talk about Disneyland,
[18:43.280 --> 18:44.880]  one of the things that struck me, I was talking to David
[18:44.880 --> 18:47.680]  Sparks, who obviously spends a lot of time at Disneyland.
[18:47.680 --> 18:50.800]  The, one of the perspective things that they do is the way
[18:50.800 --> 18:53.840]  that the, the building is situated.
[18:53.840 --> 18:57.360]  When you look out at the interior of the ring, all you see
[18:57.360 --> 18:59.440]  other than the trees at the interior of the ring and the
[18:59.440 --> 19:02.640]  rainbow stage and all of that is the other side of the ring.
[19:02.640 --> 19:05.200]  And then the Hills in the background.
[19:05.200 --> 19:08.800]  And, and you are, when you are there, you feel very much
[19:08.800 --> 19:10.320]  like there's nothing around you.
[19:10.320 --> 19:12.960]  When Steve Jobs said it, it's like a spaceship landed.
[19:13.520 --> 19:16.080]  When you're at the ring, it's a little bit like you are in
[19:16.080 --> 19:20.400]  a spaceship that just landed and there's no world outside
[19:20.400 --> 19:21.200]  of that space.
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.480]  And I think that's very intentional.
[19:22.480 --> 19:25.040]  So you can't see, they're not like other buildings you see
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.120]  outside, like the, the ring is high enough that, that from
[19:29.120 --> 19:32.480]  at least ground level in the first few floors, all you can
[19:32.480 --> 19:35.280]  really see is the ring and the Hills beyond.
[19:35.280 --> 19:35.920]  And that's about it.
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.320]  There's no city, you know, there's no city views there.
[19:38.320 --> 19:40.640]  They're all blocked by that giant ring and the trees on the
[19:40.640 --> 19:41.600]  outside block it too.
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.720]  It's it's right.
[19:42.720 --> 19:45.280]  So it is, you know, kind of a world away and you can say
[19:45.280 --> 19:46.480]  positive or negative things about that.
[19:46.480 --> 19:47.600]  You could say it's isolated.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.280]  Are they trying to cut themselves off from the world?
[19:49.280 --> 19:51.920]  But are, or are they trying to create a beautiful space
[19:51.920 --> 19:53.600]  for their people to do their best work?
[19:53.600 --> 19:54.000]  I'm struck.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.440]  I grew up in the countryside.
[19:55.440 --> 19:58.240]  We had 45 acres in the middle of nowhere.
[19:58.240 --> 20:02.000]  And I believe the interior of the ring is larger than the
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.680]  property that I grew up on.
[20:03.680 --> 20:05.600]  And it's, again, one of those things where you don't think
[20:05.600 --> 20:08.640]  about how big it is, and then you're there and you realize,
[20:08.640 --> 20:12.720]  no, that's an enormous space on the inside of the ring,
[20:12.720 --> 20:14.320]  let alone all the space on the outside.
[20:14.320 --> 20:17.680]  So I'm glad I I'm glad I got to see it because the pictures
[20:17.680 --> 20:19.040]  don't really do it justice.
[20:19.600 --> 20:21.200]  Yeah, you really have to experience it.
[20:21.200 --> 20:22.000]  You really do.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.600]  And it really was something to see.
[20:23.600 --> 20:27.280]  I have to say one of the things that's so incongruous to me
[20:27.280 --> 20:31.760]  as somebody who lives in the middle of a city and really
[20:31.760 --> 20:38.160]  does not drive very much at all is how Cupertino itself.
[20:38.160 --> 20:39.520]  I stayed at a hotel.
[20:39.520 --> 20:41.280]  One of the weird things is I didn't know where to stay.
[20:41.280 --> 20:42.880]  So I just booked Hilton.
[20:42.880 --> 20:45.600]  That's literally across the street from Apple Park, but it's
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.120]  the opposite side of Apple Park as the visitor center.
[20:49.120 --> 20:53.440]  So it's amazing because you'd get to the street outside
[20:53.440 --> 20:56.080]  the hotel I stayed at, and you can even see the ring.
[20:56.080 --> 20:56.880]  It's right there.
[20:56.880 --> 21:00.640]  It's right across one street and not really walkable.
[21:01.280 --> 21:04.880]  It is Cupertino is not a walking city.
[21:04.880 --> 21:06.080]  It is a driving city.
[21:06.080 --> 21:08.000]  It is very California in that regard.
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  Even calling it a city is technically, but the truth is,
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.880]  and this is for people who have not been to Silicon Valley
[21:16.880 --> 21:20.960]  or spent a lot of time there, it's this area with suburbs.
[21:20.960 --> 21:23.360]  And it still is basically like suburbs.
[21:23.360 --> 21:24.160]  There is.
[21:24.160 --> 21:25.200]  So you turn.
[21:25.200 --> 21:26.560]  It's Wolf Road in Tantao.
[21:26.560 --> 21:29.440]  And then I forget, is it Homestead that's in between them
[21:29.440 --> 21:30.320]  that you make a turn on?
[21:30.320 --> 21:33.280]  But literally you're on the street that Apple Park on one
[21:33.280 --> 21:35.920]  side of you as you're driving to the Tantao visitor center.
[21:35.920 --> 21:40.080]  On one side of you is the metal fence and the giant berm
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.120]  and all the trees.
[21:41.120 --> 21:43.200]  And then behind it is the ring, right?
[21:43.200 --> 21:46.640]  On the other side of the street are houses, literally
[21:46.640 --> 21:50.240]  single family homes sitting on that street.
[21:50.800 --> 21:54.400]  And this is the great, and where do you find a hotel?
[21:54.400 --> 21:55.840]  Where is there a restaurant?
[21:55.840 --> 21:56.960]  There are like a couple of restaurants
[21:56.960 --> 21:58.800]  and a hotel where you stayed.
[21:58.800 --> 22:00.640]  There's nothing on the other side at all.
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.960]  There's no downtown per se.
[22:02.960 --> 22:06.000]  And it's all because this is just a suburb that's had.
[22:06.000 --> 22:06.880]  It's not urban.
[22:06.880 --> 22:08.080]  It's suburban.
[22:08.080 --> 22:11.280]  And I think as a result, Silicon Valley culture
[22:11.280 --> 22:14.640]  is very much like, well, we need to provide for our employees.
[22:14.640 --> 22:17.920]  Because places that I've worked in cities have generally
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.760]  had like you just go out to lunch.
[22:19.760 --> 22:22.000]  And all the stuff is out in the city.
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.600]  So we don't need to provide it.
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.600]  In the suburbs, you kind of need to provide it.
[22:25.600 --> 22:29.120]  And so you get that insular campus kind of thing
[22:29.120 --> 22:31.760]  that happens in a lot of Silicon Valley companies,
[22:31.760 --> 22:32.800]  including Apple.
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.080]  It is weird, though, coming from WWDCs in San Francisco
[22:36.080 --> 22:39.040]  and San Jose that like, where do you stay?
[22:39.040 --> 22:41.520]  We stayed in Sunnyvale, which is just north,
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.440]  a couple of miles north of Apple Park.
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.840]  And there is like a shopping center and stuff around there.
[22:45.840 --> 22:47.680]  So I was able to get dinner and stuff like that.
[22:47.680 --> 22:50.240]  But again, and Sunnyvale has a little downtown.
[22:50.240 --> 22:52.720]  But really, it's the burbs.
[22:52.720 --> 22:55.680]  And if you think San Jose is a sleepy city, it is.
[22:55.680 --> 22:56.960]  But at least it's a city.
[22:56.960 --> 22:59.520]  Cupertino, I mean, again, it's just not.
[22:59.520 --> 23:02.960]  It's a suburb with a bunch of corporate campuses in it.
[23:02.960 --> 23:04.720]  And it's weird.
[23:04.720 --> 23:05.280]  It's different.
[23:05.280 --> 23:06.400]  It's not what you would expect.
[23:06.400 --> 23:09.360]  If Apple had, I'm not sure they ever would have done this.
[23:09.360 --> 23:12.240]  But if Apple had said, no, we're going to be like Twitter,
[23:12.240 --> 23:14.640]  we're going to go to downtown San Francisco,
[23:14.640 --> 23:16.960]  it would be a very different kind of vibe.
[23:16.960 --> 23:18.080]  But they're not.
[23:18.080 --> 23:21.120]  They're a classic Cupertino company.
[23:21.120 --> 23:24.320]  And they have most of the buildings in Cupertino,
[23:24.320 --> 23:27.600]  my understanding, are Apple offices, even now,
[23:27.600 --> 23:29.040]  because they have so many employees.
[23:29.040 --> 23:34.800]  So the incongruity to me is that as unwalkable or clearly
[23:34.800 --> 23:37.920]  not meant to be walked, as all of Cupertino is,
[23:37.920 --> 23:41.840]  the actual Apple Park campus is clearly designed for walking,
[23:41.840 --> 23:45.360]  both inside the ring and then outside the ring to go.
[23:45.360 --> 23:48.160]  There's footpaths and hills.
[23:48.160 --> 23:53.040]  And it really was clearly informed.
[23:53.040 --> 23:55.200]  Famously, Steve Jobs liked to take people.
[23:55.200 --> 23:57.520]  If he had something to say, he'd say, let's go on a walk.
[23:57.520 --> 24:00.160]  And employees, Walt Mossberg, other people,
[24:00.160 --> 24:02.320]  this is what he liked to do, clearly was.
[24:02.320 --> 24:06.240]  And he lived in a kind of hilly, more rural part of,
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.240]  still not very far from Silicon Valley,
[24:08.240 --> 24:10.240]  but a little town kind of off on the outskirts
[24:10.240 --> 24:12.080]  where they had that.
[24:12.080 --> 24:13.440]  And so it is replicating that.
[24:13.440 --> 24:13.920]  You're totally right.
[24:13.920 --> 24:16.320]  If you want to go for a walk by yourself
[24:16.320 --> 24:18.560]  and you work at Apple just to clear your head,
[24:18.560 --> 24:20.880]  gather your thoughts, it is wonderful for that.
[24:20.880 --> 24:24.160]  If you want to go for a walk with a colleague
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.600]  or two colleagues and talk out an issue or something like that,
[24:27.600 --> 24:29.520]  it is truly wonderful for that.
[24:29.520 --> 24:31.680]  Quiet, isolated, and locks.
[24:33.040 --> 24:35.120]  And once you're walking around inside,
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.040]  you don't feel like you're at a place
[24:37.040 --> 24:39.520]  where literally thousands of your colleagues
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.800]  all work at the same time.
[24:41.360 --> 24:42.880]  You really feel like you're on your own.
[24:42.880 --> 24:44.640]  It's remarkable.
[24:44.640 --> 24:45.920]  It's really something to see.
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.640]  I don't know if, it didn't feel very populated.
[24:48.640 --> 24:50.320]  I think some of that is the pandemic, right?
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.600]  And we were there on an event day,
[24:51.600 --> 24:53.600]  so probably even fewer people were there
[24:53.600 --> 24:55.840]  who were not part of the event management.
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.440]  But I would imagine it's so huge
[24:57.440 --> 24:59.440]  that even if it was fully packed with people,
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.800]  it would be, it's so huge that you could,
[25:02.800 --> 25:05.120]  you could get away, you know, down a path
[25:05.120 --> 25:07.680]  past some trees and clear your head a little bit.
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.240]  It's yeah, it's very interesting,
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.160]  very interesting design and a very interesting use of space.
[25:14.160 --> 25:15.840]  And the building is not small, right?
[25:15.840 --> 25:17.440]  But it is, they did make a point of having
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.440]  all that open space and all those trees.
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.240]  And it's yeah, it's a landmark.
[25:22.240 --> 25:23.280]  I mean, it's already a landmark.
[25:23.280 --> 25:25.280]  When I was coming in, I flew in from,
[25:25.280 --> 25:26.480]  I forget where I'm visiting my mom.
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.040]  Maybe I flew into SFO and like,
[25:29.040 --> 25:31.040]  you can't miss it as you're flying in.
[25:31.040 --> 25:32.480]  Like there's nothing like it.
[25:32.480 --> 25:34.640]  There's city grids and suburban grids.
[25:34.640 --> 25:37.920]  And then there's this ring with trees.
[25:37.920 --> 25:39.760]  It's like nothing else.
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.200]  All right, let me take a break here
[25:41.200 --> 25:42.400]  and thank our first sponsor.
[25:42.400 --> 25:45.920]  RevenueCat in-app subscriptions made easy.
[25:46.640 --> 25:47.920]  If you've ever worked on an app,
[25:47.920 --> 25:51.360]  you know how much of a pain in-app purchases are.
[25:51.360 --> 25:53.680]  RevenueCat makes them easy.
[25:53.680 --> 25:54.880]  With just a few lines of code,
[25:54.880 --> 25:58.240]  RevenueCat provides payments, infrastructure, analytics,
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.160]  data integrations, and more.
[26:00.800 --> 26:03.280]  Plus it gives you back time,
[26:03.280 --> 26:05.200]  which is our most precious resource
[26:05.760 --> 26:07.840]  from dealing with edge cases and changes
[26:07.840 --> 26:09.280]  from Apple and Google.
[26:09.920 --> 26:11.600]  Thousands of the world's best apps,
[26:11.600 --> 26:14.640]  including Notion, Buffer, and ClassDojo
[26:14.640 --> 26:17.360]  use RevenueCat to power their app business.
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.560]  RevenueCat is free until you hit $10,000 of monthly revenue.
[26:22.560 --> 26:25.440]  And it's always free to try until you ship.
[26:25.440 --> 26:25.840]  That's it.
[26:25.840 --> 26:26.720]  That's the whole message.
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.920]  Go to revenuecat, R-E-V-E-N-U-E, revenuecat.com
[26:31.920 --> 26:32.720]  to find out more.
[26:32.720 --> 26:33.840]  My thanks to RevenueCat.
[26:33.840 --> 26:36.080]  Once again, that's revenuecat.com
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.040]  in-app purchases made easy.
[26:39.040 --> 26:41.360]  Before we move on to the actual content of the show,
[26:41.360 --> 26:42.080]  I will say this.
[26:42.080 --> 26:42.880]  It was weird.
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.800]  One of the cool things I have, like, it clarified to me.
[26:46.800 --> 26:49.120]  To me, they blurred together my circles
[26:49.120 --> 26:51.040]  of Apple event friends, right?
[26:51.040 --> 26:55.680]  But the event was very, it's like the prototypical guy
[26:55.680 --> 26:57.760]  who goes to the gym and only works on his arms
[26:57.760 --> 26:59.760]  and his legs remain like toothpicks.
[27:00.480 --> 27:04.640]  It's like my media friends were all there, right?
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.800]  And for all of the sort of,
[27:06.800 --> 27:09.120]  hey, they only announced it 10 or 11 days in advance,
[27:09.120 --> 27:10.960]  and there seemed like a bit of a down low.
[27:10.960 --> 27:13.440]  And the actual email invitations that everybody
[27:13.440 --> 27:17.120]  in the media got weren't about attending in person.
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.480]  They were like, here, watch online on Monday at 10 a.m.
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.320]  or whatever time, or 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.160]  But then they called everybody.
[27:26.160 --> 27:27.600]  It seemed like they called everybody.
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.440]  Everybody I know in the media, friends, acquaintances,
[27:31.440 --> 27:32.880]  it seemed like everybody was there.
[27:32.880 --> 27:34.560]  And it was so good to see everybody.
[27:35.200 --> 27:38.880]  And I have another smaller, much smaller circle of friends
[27:38.880 --> 27:43.920]  of people who work at Apple, who I often run into at WWDC.
[27:43.920 --> 27:46.960]  I ran into several of them, and it was good to see them.
[27:47.680 --> 27:50.880]  But most of my developer friends weren't there.
[27:50.880 --> 27:52.960]  Most of the people I know who were developers
[27:52.960 --> 27:54.800]  either didn't enter the lottery
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.640]  to get those special day passes or entered
[27:58.640 --> 28:01.360]  and weren't selected, because it sounds like
[28:01.360 --> 28:03.840]  there were only about 1,000 of them from around the world
[28:03.840 --> 28:07.360]  as opposed to the 5,000 attendees
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.400]  at a traditional in-person WWDC in a convention center.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.280]  And that seemed weird.
[28:13.280 --> 28:14.640]  It was like so good to see everybody.
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.480]  It's like, hey, how come everybody I'm running into
[28:16.480 --> 28:17.120]  is in the media?
[28:17.120 --> 28:18.800]  Oh, yeah, because that's the only people who are here.
[28:20.240 --> 28:22.800]  It is, I mean, and I think this is the future.
[28:24.000 --> 28:24.560]  Who knows?
[28:24.560 --> 28:26.960]  But this feels like a model for them for the future.
[28:26.960 --> 28:29.440]  Perhaps it'll be at the Steve Jobs Theater next year, right?
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.120]  I think they would like to get it in the theater
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.320]  because that's why they built it.
[28:32.320 --> 28:35.600]  But the model is WWDC is online.
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.600]  There is a media event because the keynote is always a media event.
[28:39.600 --> 28:40.800]  It's not just for developers.
[28:40.800 --> 28:42.000]  In fact, I don't know if you noticed,
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.280]  but in the keynote, they refer to developers.
[28:45.280 --> 28:47.360]  In the State of the Union, they refer to you.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.920]  And it's like, literally, the State of the Union
[28:49.920 --> 28:51.680]  is for developers.
[28:51.680 --> 28:57.520]  The keynote is about developers, sort of, but it's for everybody.
[28:57.520 --> 28:59.120]  And so that's a media event.
[28:59.120 --> 29:00.880]  So of course, we were all there for the media
[29:00.880 --> 29:02.400]  because we're the media event people.
[29:02.400 --> 29:03.440]  We come for that.
[29:03.440 --> 29:05.200]  And then they had their small group of developers,
[29:05.200 --> 29:06.160]  which was great.
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.560]  And you can still make it the trip of a lifetime.
[29:08.560 --> 29:09.760]  I got to go to Cupertino.
[29:09.760 --> 29:10.720]  I got to see The Ring.
[29:10.720 --> 29:11.680]  It was great.
[29:11.680 --> 29:14.000]  And it gives Apple an excited audience
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  that maybe in a theater live setting
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.320]  would be really great for applause and things like that,
[29:18.320 --> 29:19.200]  whether it was in the theater
[29:19.200 --> 29:20.960]  or whether it was just outside again.
[29:20.960 --> 29:22.960]  But I feel like that's a good mixture.
[29:22.960 --> 29:24.720]  And they've got their developer center, right?
[29:24.720 --> 29:26.320]  That's a good mixture to have.
[29:27.200 --> 29:28.640]  And the truth is, if you think about it,
[29:28.640 --> 29:30.960]  it's like, yeah, it's not the 5,000 people or whatever
[29:30.960 --> 29:32.080]  who came to San Jose.
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.680]  But the truth is whether it's 1,000 people or 500 people
[29:35.680 --> 29:38.160]  or 5,000 people who go as developers,
[29:38.880 --> 29:43.040]  it's still just a how many nines after 99.9%
[29:43.680 --> 29:46.400]  of Apple developers are watching online.
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.360]  Like you will never get a representative sample
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.080]  unless you did it like a stadium.
[29:52.080 --> 29:53.760]  And even then you wouldn't really.
[29:53.760 --> 29:57.520]  So what you really want is have the opportunity
[29:57.520 --> 30:00.720]  for some developers, key developers and lucky developers
[30:00.720 --> 30:02.240]  to come and make the pilgrimage
[30:02.240 --> 30:05.360]  and have that moment to be really excited,
[30:05.360 --> 30:06.960]  get the media there for your event.
[30:06.960 --> 30:09.680]  And then the rest of the world gets the sessions as videos.
[30:10.240 --> 30:12.160]  And that's not a bad package.
[30:12.160 --> 30:14.800]  I think this was really viable
[30:14.800 --> 30:16.320]  for the future of this conference.
[30:17.360 --> 30:19.360]  And it's funny because Apple famously,
[30:19.360 --> 30:20.400]  I don't know if you know this,
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.000]  but Apple often seems not to wanna speak about the future.
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.760]  But they didn't say anything.
[30:25.760 --> 30:27.760]  Nobody told me anything off the record
[30:27.760 --> 30:29.760]  about what they plan to do long-term,
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.600]  but just what they did say
[30:31.600 --> 30:33.600]  about how they thought this was going
[30:33.600 --> 30:34.960]  and what they thought about the future
[30:35.840 --> 30:40.880]  was surprisingly forthright that the actual content,
[30:40.880 --> 30:44.480]  the sessions of WWDC almost certainly,
[30:44.480 --> 30:49.520]  I mean, I would say 99.9% sure
[30:49.520 --> 30:51.920]  are going to be like this forevermore,
[30:51.920 --> 30:56.720]  that this is just a total win for everybody involved.
[30:56.720 --> 30:59.760]  It's better because all developers around the world
[30:59.760 --> 31:02.000]  get the same access to the sessions.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.440]  It is better for the Apple employees who present them
[31:05.440 --> 31:08.320]  because they're all filmed in advance
[31:08.320 --> 31:12.480]  and it removes any sort of stage fear of public speaking
[31:13.680 --> 31:16.000]  that you can rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.480]  in front of your colleagues.
[31:18.480 --> 31:19.920]  And then all of a sudden you're on stage
[31:19.920 --> 31:22.000]  in front of hundreds of,
[31:22.000 --> 31:23.840]  or maybe thousands for certain sessions,
[31:23.840 --> 31:26.240]  attendees speaking, and you've never spoken
[31:26.240 --> 31:29.040]  in front of more than a few dozen people before it.
[31:29.040 --> 31:30.720]  Now there's 500 people in front of you.
[31:30.720 --> 31:31.760]  It's different.
[31:31.760 --> 31:34.000]  In my time going to old WWDCs,
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.800]  the speakers from Apple were always very good.
[31:36.800 --> 31:38.080]  It wasn't like there was a lot of,
[31:38.080 --> 31:40.400]  ooh, that person really was scared up there.
[31:40.400 --> 31:41.840]  But it's easier this way, I think.
[31:41.840 --> 31:45.280]  I also think the actual what you get on the video
[31:45.280 --> 31:47.680]  is just better when it was meant for video
[31:48.320 --> 31:51.280]  than when it was presented on a stage.
[31:51.280 --> 31:52.400]  They're just better.
[31:52.400 --> 31:55.440]  They're just better and there's no going.
[31:55.440 --> 31:57.440]  I was gonna mention time slots, right?
[31:57.440 --> 31:59.520]  Like it used to be you had to fill a 30 minute
[31:59.520 --> 32:00.480]  or 60 minute time slot
[32:00.480 --> 32:02.160]  and sometimes they'd put different groups together
[32:02.160 --> 32:04.320]  and be a mishmash or you'd get a session
[32:04.320 --> 32:05.600]  that would be short and then you'd be like,
[32:05.600 --> 32:07.600]  well, what do I do for the next half hour?
[32:07.600 --> 32:11.600]  And these sessions, if it only needs to be 12 minutes long,
[32:11.600 --> 32:13.520]  it's 12 minutes long and then you move on.
[32:13.520 --> 32:16.640]  If it needs to be 45 minutes long, it's 45 minutes long.
[32:16.640 --> 32:17.760]  And then they go in the archive
[32:17.760 --> 32:19.760]  where they can be viewed forever
[32:19.760 --> 32:21.600]  at your leisure for reference.
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.840]  It's better in every conceivable way, I guess,
[32:25.840 --> 32:27.760]  other than the fact that there's no interaction.
[32:27.760 --> 32:31.760]  But Apple took interactivity out of WWDC like 10 years ago.
[32:31.760 --> 32:33.760]  There used to be feedback sessions.
[32:33.760 --> 32:36.080]  There used to be Q&A at the end of sessions.
[32:36.080 --> 32:38.400]  And for the last five or 10 years,
[32:38.960 --> 32:41.440]  there's no interactivity in the sessions themselves.
[32:41.440 --> 32:42.800]  So at that point,
[32:43.600 --> 32:46.320]  if you're gonna not have interactivity in the sessions,
[32:46.320 --> 32:48.240]  they've got other ways that they do that now.
[32:48.240 --> 32:50.240]  This is way, way better all the way.
[32:50.240 --> 32:52.160]  Have you ever been to a WWDC
[32:52.160 --> 32:53.360]  where you've gone into a session saying,
[32:53.360 --> 32:54.640]  I'm really excited about this?
[32:54.640 --> 32:56.960]  And you get five minutes in and they put up the code.
[32:56.960 --> 32:58.240]  And as a media person, you're like,
[32:58.240 --> 33:00.560]  I want the big picture, but I'm not a developer.
[33:00.560 --> 33:02.720]  And you're like, damn it, now I gotta get out of here.
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.560]  And is there another session going on?
[33:04.560 --> 33:05.600]  And what did I miss?
[33:05.600 --> 33:07.520]  And can I get in or is it full?
[33:08.080 --> 33:09.760]  Like, get all of that out of here.
[33:09.760 --> 33:10.800]  Like, we don't need any of that.
[33:10.800 --> 33:13.200]  And you don't wanna be the only person getting up to leave.
[33:15.840 --> 33:16.480]  I've done that.
[33:16.480 --> 33:17.520]  I've absolutely done that.
[33:17.520 --> 33:19.440]  It's like, oh, look, now the code has come out.
[33:19.440 --> 33:19.920]  Goodbye.
[33:19.920 --> 33:20.320]  It is.
[33:20.320 --> 33:22.320]  It's one of those things where I would just wait
[33:22.320 --> 33:23.600]  and see somebody else leave.
[33:23.600 --> 33:24.960]  Like, okay, somebody else left.
[33:24.960 --> 33:25.920]  Now I can get up and leave.
[33:25.920 --> 33:27.760]  Now I can get it.
[33:27.760 --> 33:28.800]  Now I'm not leaving in a huff.
[33:28.800 --> 33:30.320]  I'm just part of the crowd that's leaving.
[33:30.320 --> 33:31.840]  Well, the truth is, I mean, this is a weird thing
[33:31.840 --> 33:36.320]  about being a media person covering a developer conference
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.600]  is we're there for the most part.
[33:39.600 --> 33:41.600]  If you're John Syracuse, you might have an app or two
[33:41.600 --> 33:42.480]  that you're thinking of.
[33:42.480 --> 33:45.120]  But most of us are there for the big picture
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.840]  about what's new in the OS and how does it work.
[33:47.840 --> 33:50.320]  And a lot of these sessions are fantastic, especially
[33:50.320 --> 33:52.000]  now that they're on video, because you
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.240]  can glean how it works.
[33:54.240 --> 33:56.720]  And then they say, we'll dive into the code now.
[33:56.720 --> 34:00.240]  And then it's less interesting to us.
[34:00.240 --> 34:01.280]  It's great for developers.
[34:01.280 --> 34:02.320]  And it's not for us.
[34:02.320 --> 34:03.840]  But there's so much that can be gleaned.
[34:03.840 --> 34:06.480]  I love watching developer sessions
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.160]  because you learn how it works and can explain
[34:10.160 --> 34:13.040]  that to your audience without actually needing
[34:13.040 --> 34:14.400]  to know how to build it.
[34:14.400 --> 34:15.840]  Because I don't need that part.
[34:15.840 --> 34:16.880]  I just need to know how it works.
[34:16.880 --> 34:19.280]  I remember that was one of my favorite sessions of all time
[34:19.280 --> 34:20.800]  was when they introduced Time Machine.
[34:20.800 --> 34:22.800]  And they did a session about Time Machine.
[34:22.800 --> 34:24.720]  And they got to the code eventually.
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.080]  And I had to run away.
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.960]  But it was the only place they explained the whole time ever
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.880]  in public at that conference, how does this new feature
[34:34.880 --> 34:35.520]  actually work?
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.400]  And it was so great.
[34:36.400 --> 34:37.760]  Because then people would say, how
[34:37.760 --> 34:38.960]  does this Time Machine thing work?
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.320]  And I said, well, I couldn't build you an app.
[34:41.040 --> 34:42.720]  But I know how it works.
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.520]  And that's what I love about WWDC is the little details
[34:47.520 --> 34:48.800]  that you get in those sessions.
[34:48.800 --> 34:49.680]  Yeah.
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.440]  I do think it's just interesting.
[34:51.440 --> 34:53.920]  Because they obviously did not need to do this.
[34:53.920 --> 34:56.560]  I mean, and they could have done something much smaller
[34:56.560 --> 34:57.680]  with the media only.
[34:57.680 --> 35:00.000]  They certainly didn't need to invite 1,000 developers
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.840]  from around the world to be there and do
[35:01.840 --> 35:03.200]  this big thing outside.
[35:03.200 --> 35:05.760]  And like you said, I really don't
[35:05.760 --> 35:09.840]  think that when Johnny Ive and the architects envisioned
[35:09.840 --> 35:11.840]  that space, whatever, I don't know if that,
[35:11.840 --> 35:14.960]  I generally have a poor sense of north, south, east, west,
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.720]  whatever side of the ring of the lawn they used for the,
[35:18.720 --> 35:20.480]  it seemed like, more than 1,000.
[35:20.480 --> 35:22.720]  Because all 1,000 invitees were there.
[35:22.720 --> 35:24.880]  But then there were hundreds and hundreds,
[35:24.880 --> 35:26.720]  maybe even an extra 1,000 people who
[35:26.720 --> 35:29.680]  were inside the ring with the doors open,
[35:30.640 --> 35:32.880]  viewing on additional screens.
[35:32.880 --> 35:34.720]  I think those were largely Apple employees
[35:34.720 --> 35:35.520]  who were watching live.
[35:35.520 --> 35:38.080]  But it seemed like at least ballpark,
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.240]  there were 2,000 people watching live.
[35:40.240 --> 35:42.880]  That space, I don't think, was ever envisioned for that.
[35:42.880 --> 35:48.000]  Yet, it did not seem retrofitted for it at all
[35:48.000 --> 35:48.720]  while I was there.
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.400]  It seemed like this is perfect.
[35:50.400 --> 35:53.520]  And I mean, so I could imagine that the answer is next year,
[35:53.520 --> 35:56.560]  it'll be another 1,000 invitees, same space,
[35:56.560 --> 35:57.520]  same number of people.
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.000]  Maybe they'd invite a few hundred more and widen.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.400]  It seemed like they could have widened it a little.
[36:04.400 --> 36:08.720]  You know, there was some kind of spitball math
[36:08.720 --> 36:12.160]  that they did with regard to COVID precautions,
[36:12.800 --> 36:15.200]  in terms of how many people they really wanted there
[36:15.200 --> 36:16.480]  and how many people they could handle.
[36:16.480 --> 36:18.480]  But I really do think at the same time,
[36:18.480 --> 36:20.880]  and I know I'm just reiterating a point you made,
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.080]  a space that was never designed to be used that way
[36:24.080 --> 36:26.000]  seemed perfect to be used that way.
[36:27.200 --> 36:30.400]  Yeah, I think the only question I would have is,
[36:30.400 --> 36:32.560]  do they want ultimately to have everything
[36:32.560 --> 36:36.000]  be an entirely pre-produced video?
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.800]  Or would they like to get back to the media event
[36:38.800 --> 36:41.920]  that has a live component for the audience?
[36:41.920 --> 36:44.480]  Because we were watching, it was a watch-along, right?
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.560]  Like Tim and Craig came out at the beginning to it live
[36:48.560 --> 36:50.640]  and said, hey, we're going to show you a video now.
[36:50.640 --> 36:52.800]  It was like going to Comic-Con or something, right?
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.360]  And now we're going to play the video, or a film festival,
[36:55.360 --> 36:56.320]  or something like that.
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.360]  Would they, do they like the idea
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.320]  of doing a live event so much that even if their media event
[37:02.320 --> 37:04.160]  has a lot of pre-taped stuff in it,
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.800]  would they like to go back to having the basics of it
[37:06.800 --> 37:09.120]  and the intros of the segments and the high-level stuff
[37:09.120 --> 37:11.600]  be on the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.680]  and then play those bits?
[37:13.680 --> 37:15.760]  And if they do that, right, like that's,
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.680]  the theater is a better venue for that probably than outdoors.
[37:19.680 --> 37:21.360]  Although they could do it outdoors.
[37:21.360 --> 37:22.800]  So that's the only question I've got is,
[37:22.800 --> 37:25.360]  what do they want their media events to be like ultimately?
[37:25.360 --> 37:27.760]  And do they want them to be entirely pre-taped?
[37:27.760 --> 37:30.400]  Or do they want a little live element to it?
[37:30.400 --> 37:31.200]  That's the mystery.
[37:31.200 --> 37:32.880]  Because otherwise, yeah, they could totally just repeat
[37:32.880 --> 37:34.960]  what they did this year, and it would work fine.
[37:34.960 --> 37:37.360]  The big difference, the keynote is obviously different.
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.160]  And I've said this multiple times over the last two years
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.640]  of COVID that effectively they've created
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.360]  their own branded TV show, an episodic continuing series
[37:49.360 --> 37:52.560]  of shows that doesn't really have a name.
[37:52.560 --> 37:54.880]  It's just Apple keynotes in the COVID era
[37:54.880 --> 37:56.720]  where there's no live audience.
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.720]  But if you watch them, or just go back
[37:58.720 --> 38:01.520]  and just watch the opening five minutes of a bunch of them,
[38:01.520 --> 38:06.160]  right from the first one, which I think was WWDC 2020,
[38:06.160 --> 38:10.480]  or maybe the, I guess technically the first one would be
[38:10.480 --> 38:15.440]  the sort of really almost emergency event in April
[38:15.440 --> 38:20.080]  of that year when they unveiled the magic keyboard for iPad
[38:20.080 --> 38:23.120]  and the trackpad support in iPad OS,
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.480]  which didn't have the full flavor of these events
[38:28.480 --> 38:33.280]  and the branding of the show, where they zip around parts
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.760]  of Apple Park and transition and warp from,
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.040]  oh, we're upstairs in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.880]  Now we're going underground to Johnny Ceruggi's Secret Lab,
[38:44.880 --> 38:50.080]  which we're pretending is in some kind of a bunker.
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.560]  But they're very consistent with those transitions
[38:52.560 --> 38:57.200]  in the way that episodic TV shows always have the same feel,
[38:57.200 --> 39:01.440]  like an episode of The X-Files feels like an episode of The X-Files.
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.920]  You could just tune into an X-Files rerun,
[39:03.920 --> 39:07.120]  and even if it's not showing Scully and Mulder,
[39:07.120 --> 39:09.360]  but the characters of the episode, you could be like,
[39:09.360 --> 39:10.800]  oh, yeah, I'm watching The X-Files,
[39:10.800 --> 39:14.560]  because just the music and the feel of it.
[39:14.560 --> 39:17.840]  WWDC, even if they want to stick with that for the most part,
[39:17.840 --> 39:21.600]  and I think they will to some regard, WWDC is different
[39:21.600 --> 39:24.320]  because it's the only event left on Apple's calendar
[39:24.320 --> 39:27.680]  now that Mac World Expo is a decade dead,
[39:27.680 --> 39:33.920]  where there's a live audience filled with actual people, right?
[39:33.920 --> 39:37.520]  People who are like regular people who will cheer
[39:37.520 --> 39:40.640]  and be a good studio audience, for sure.
[39:40.640 --> 39:42.640]  Because the media are bad at that,
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.000]  and so they pack the theater with VIPs and Apple employees
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.640]  who will cheer because the media aren't cheering so much.
[39:48.640 --> 39:51.520]  But the developers are, now that Expo is gone
[39:51.520 --> 39:53.600]  and you can't get a ticket to an Apple keynote,
[39:53.600 --> 39:55.760]  the only way you get a ticket to an Apple keynote now
[39:55.760 --> 39:59.120]  is to be a developer and win the lottery, essentially.
[39:59.120 --> 40:02.960]  And they're a good audience, and it is good theater to do that.
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.560]  I wonder, I don't know if you remember,
[40:04.560 --> 40:06.000]  you're a little younger than me,
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.800]  but Saturday Night Live back in the early 80s,
[40:08.800 --> 40:11.280]  when Lorne Michaels left, Dick Ebersol came in,
[40:11.280 --> 40:13.120]  and this is TV trivia,
[40:13.120 --> 40:16.000]  but they did a lot of pre-recorded stuff
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.040]  on Saturday Night Live,
[40:17.040 --> 40:18.800]  which was very controversial at the time
[40:18.800 --> 40:20.720]  because it was live, it was a live show.
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.720]  And suddenly Billy Crystal and Christopher Guest
[40:22.720 --> 40:24.400]  and all these people are doing,
[40:24.400 --> 40:27.440]  Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy are doing filmed segments
[40:27.440 --> 40:29.120]  that they do during the week, essentially,
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.080]  and then they run them during the show and it's not live.
[40:32.080 --> 40:33.200]  And I've been thinking about that
[40:33.200 --> 40:35.360]  because that is kind of my question,
[40:35.360 --> 40:36.720]  is what does Apple want it to be?
[40:36.720 --> 40:39.520]  A completely not live pre-taped thing
[40:39.520 --> 40:40.640]  that has a lot of advantages,
[40:40.640 --> 40:43.520]  including the music and the transitions and all of that.
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.800]  And the classic Steve Jobs, live on stage,
[40:46.800 --> 40:48.560]  cheering people in the audience kind of thing.
[40:48.560 --> 40:51.120]  And it's like, I don't know how addicted they are
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.360]  to that kind of stagecraft, but I can see there being
[40:53.360 --> 40:56.400]  a hybrid where it's a live show, right?
[40:56.400 --> 40:58.880]  With the big air quotes, it's a live show,
[40:58.880 --> 41:01.440]  but a lot of it, I don't know how much,
[41:01.440 --> 41:03.760]  but a lot of it is still the pre-taped bits
[41:03.760 --> 41:05.360]  because they were always expanding
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.760]  how much pre-taped stuff they had in the keynotes.
[41:07.760 --> 41:09.840]  So they could do even more of that
[41:09.840 --> 41:12.000]  and still like claim that it's live
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.800]  because Tim Cook was live and Greg Joswiak was live
[41:14.800 --> 41:17.360]  and a handful of people were live,
[41:17.360 --> 41:18.880]  throwing it into the videos.
[41:18.880 --> 41:21.360]  And that they could even pipe in the cheering
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.760]  from the audience while the videos were playing.
[41:23.760 --> 41:26.240]  And would that be better for stagecraft?
[41:26.240 --> 41:27.760]  I'm sure they've had these conversations
[41:27.760 --> 41:29.840]  and I'm fascinated to see what they decide
[41:29.840 --> 41:32.160]  in terms of, do we just completely lock it down
[41:32.160 --> 41:34.800]  like we've been doing, or is there value
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.440]  in having some sort of a live before a studio audience
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.560]  kind of component just for the stagecraft of it?
[41:40.560 --> 41:42.800]  Yeah, the last thing I want to say about that
[41:42.800 --> 41:45.200]  was that you mentioned the intro from Tim,
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.120]  the live intro on stage in front of 2,000 people
[41:49.120 --> 41:50.880]  that Tim Cook and then Craig,
[41:50.880 --> 41:54.640]  he invited Craig Federighi up to say hello to.
[41:55.520 --> 41:57.520]  I knew something was up because that happened
[41:57.520 --> 42:00.240]  at like 9.55, I forget what time,
[42:00.240 --> 42:01.680]  wasn't it 10 a.m. Pacific?
[42:01.680 --> 42:02.800]  It was like 9.55.
[42:03.360 --> 42:05.760]  And one thing about the Tim Cook keynotes
[42:05.760 --> 42:08.000]  is they start exactly on time.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.520]  Like if it's a 10 o'clock keynote,
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.240]  you can almost set your watch by it.
[42:12.240 --> 42:13.440]  But if you're wearing an Apple watch,
[42:13.440 --> 42:14.960]  of course you don't need to set your watch.
[42:14.960 --> 42:17.600]  But if you're wearing a watch that needs to be set,
[42:17.600 --> 42:19.920]  you can pretty much set it to the minute
[42:19.920 --> 42:22.960]  that when Tim Cook comes out and says hello
[42:22.960 --> 42:25.280]  or whatever his go-to greeting is,
[42:25.280 --> 42:27.680]  or welcome, whatever, good morning, right?
[42:27.680 --> 42:29.120]  That's what he says, good morning.
[42:29.120 --> 42:30.160]  That it's 10 o'clock.
[42:30.160 --> 42:33.600]  And so 9.55, everybody I was seated near,
[42:33.600 --> 42:36.800]  we were like, oh, this must not be part of the keynote,
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.480]  right, because we just knew there's no way
[42:38.480 --> 42:40.160]  he's coming out early, he's not coming out late.
[42:40.160 --> 42:43.200]  Jobs, I mean, it wasn't like Jobs was super late,
[42:43.200 --> 42:45.200]  but he might be, you could give him
[42:45.200 --> 42:46.480]  at least five minutes, right?
[42:46.480 --> 42:48.640]  I mean, sometimes the keynotes were five minutes late.
[42:48.640 --> 42:50.240]  And it wasn't part of the keynote.
[42:50.240 --> 42:53.520]  So if you watched from home, you didn't see this.
[42:53.520 --> 42:56.400]  And that did surprise me a little,
[42:56.400 --> 43:02.080]  because they could have just done the intro.
[43:02.880 --> 43:04.560]  Here's the keynote, hope you enjoy it.
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.080]  And then at the very end, Tim Cook
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.920]  could have come back on stage and said,
[43:07.920 --> 43:10.400]  thank you for coming, this is a unique day
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.240]  in Apple's history, we've got a great afternoon
[43:14.240 --> 43:15.360]  with the State of the Union.
[43:15.360 --> 43:17.120]  And we have a great week of sessions ahead
[43:17.120 --> 43:19.280]  for everybody around the world to watch.
[43:19.280 --> 43:23.680]  Go wait for a MacBook Air, goodbye.
[43:24.320 --> 43:25.280]  And then it's gone.
[43:25.280 --> 43:27.440]  That could have been part of the actual broadcast,
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.320]  but wasn't, I don't know why, because the other thing
[43:30.320 --> 43:32.000]  that would have allowed them to show,
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.160]  which I think they like to show, is the audience, right?
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.600]  And to show, look, we've got thousands of people here
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.840]  who are ecstatic and enthusiastic and happy.
[43:44.400 --> 43:48.880]  And uniquely, for this one, in the beautiful California
[43:48.880 --> 43:50.480]  sunshine, it was a beautiful day.
[43:50.480 --> 43:51.600]  That's something to see.
[43:51.600 --> 43:53.760]  I don't know if you noticed it, there was a big drone
[43:53.760 --> 43:56.960]  flying overhead and lots of speculation.
[43:56.960 --> 43:59.200]  Was this an unauthorized drone?
[43:59.200 --> 44:01.280]  And a lot of people were like, if it were,
[44:01.280 --> 44:02.320]  it would be shot down by now.
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.840]  And it's like, you say that, I'm not quite sure
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.360]  if Apple has anti-drone technology on campus.
[44:09.360 --> 44:11.360]  Maybe jammers, maybe they could jam it or something.
[44:11.360 --> 44:12.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.360]  But then I thought that was gonna be like a live shot
[44:15.360 --> 44:20.160]  of like, and maybe it's an experiment to see
[44:20.160 --> 44:21.280]  if they can do that, right?
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.040]  Maybe they were trying it out to say, well,
[44:23.040 --> 44:24.560]  what if, is this viable?
[44:24.560 --> 44:27.200]  Because I think there is a viable scenario where they do
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.880]  something like they did this time,
[44:28.880 --> 44:34.080]  except that wrapping segment, the envelope around the rest
[44:34.080 --> 44:37.680]  of the presentation with Tim Cook saying hello and goodbye.
[44:37.680 --> 44:41.520]  If that was live and the rest of the thing was pre-taped,
[44:41.520 --> 44:45.280]  but the live part was streamed live and they showed Apple Park
[44:45.280 --> 44:47.360]  and they, again, cause it's stagecraft, right?
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.240]  It's all showmanship.
[44:48.240 --> 44:50.320]  So it's like, how do we make a bigger impact?
[44:50.320 --> 44:52.720]  And I don't know, Tim Cook coming out to a live studio
[44:52.720 --> 44:55.360]  audience, instead of just wandering down a hallway
[44:55.360 --> 44:58.080]  at Apple Park, I think has a bigger impact,
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.880]  but I, you know, that's their decision to make.
[45:00.880 --> 45:03.040]  But the drone shot, I absolutely thought,
[45:03.040 --> 45:05.520]  are we gonna open this live stream with a drone shot
[45:05.520 --> 45:06.320]  of Apple Park?
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.200]  Yeah, or open it with Tim Cook and then say there's thousands
[45:11.200 --> 45:13.600]  of people here and then the people at home,
[45:13.600 --> 45:15.040]  it would cut to that drone shot.
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.600]  And again, you could do the Letterman bit, right?
[45:17.600 --> 45:20.000]  Where he's like inside and you think that it's a pre-taped
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.240]  thing and then he walks out and there's a whole group
[45:22.240 --> 45:24.880]  of people there and it turns out it is live, right?
[45:24.880 --> 45:26.080]  Like that would be great.
[45:26.080 --> 45:27.520]  There's a lot of ways you could play with it,
[45:27.520 --> 45:30.960]  but as always with you and me, it comes back to sports.
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.280]  But in televised sports, I think it's a worldwide phenomenon,
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.480]  but I certainly in the US for, you're in my lifetime,
[45:38.480 --> 45:41.680]  it has been a big deal that any major sporting event
[45:41.680 --> 45:45.520]  has a blimp flying outside to provide the overhead shots,
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.600]  which makes sense for outdoor sports like the World Series
[45:49.600 --> 45:52.640]  and the Super Bowl and NFL playoff game or any NFL game,
[45:52.640 --> 45:52.960]  you know?
[45:52.960 --> 45:56.640]  And it is fascinating and it's something I never thought
[45:56.640 --> 45:58.720]  about growing up because it was always the case.
[45:58.720 --> 46:01.040]  There's always, it used to always be the Goodyear blimp
[46:01.040 --> 46:03.360]  and now there's a couple other brands that have blimps,
[46:03.360 --> 46:07.440]  but they pay something, Goodyear gets a promotional
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.480]  consideration, but then they fly a blimp over the stadium
[46:10.480 --> 46:12.800]  and then they provide overhead shots.
[46:12.800 --> 46:15.040]  And there's no other way to get a perspective.
[46:15.040 --> 46:17.680]  Like, what does it look like when 70,000 people
[46:17.680 --> 46:18.560]  are in a stadium?
[46:19.520 --> 46:22.720]  You can't photograph them from within the stadium
[46:22.720 --> 46:24.720]  and from the ground, you don't get that perspective.
[46:24.720 --> 46:26.000]  You need that overhead shot.
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.480]  I thought that's what the drone was, but apparently not.
[46:29.680 --> 46:32.000]  And they are actually using drones in sporting events now.
[46:32.000 --> 46:32.960]  I've seen it a few times.
[46:32.960 --> 46:35.520]  I think even Apple's Friday Night Baseball used a drone
[46:36.560 --> 46:37.600]  for a couple of shots.
[46:38.560 --> 46:40.800]  And we're going to see more of those too,
[46:40.800 --> 46:42.960]  because then you've got like, the Goodyear blimp
[46:42.960 --> 46:44.880]  is way up above and you can see the parking lot
[46:44.880 --> 46:47.200]  and the traffic outside the stadium and all of that.
[46:47.200 --> 46:50.720]  Those drone shots, you can perfectly position it
[46:50.720 --> 46:53.280]  like a video game, literally anywhere you want.
[46:53.280 --> 46:54.720]  And so we'll see more of that.
[46:54.720 --> 46:58.480]  Yeah, if I had to guess what that drone was,
[46:58.480 --> 47:02.240]  it was Apple seeing what it would be like for them
[47:02.240 --> 47:03.600]  to do that shot.
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.120]  And if it wasn't that, then I apologize
[47:07.120 --> 47:10.720]  and send my commiserations to whoever owned that drone,
[47:10.720 --> 47:12.400]  because they're probably not ever getting it back.
[47:14.800 --> 47:15.760]  Anyway, it was good.
[47:15.760 --> 47:17.200]  Let me thank another sponsor here.
[47:17.200 --> 47:18.960]  It's our good friends at Collide.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.560]  Oh man, I love Collide.
[47:20.560 --> 47:23.920]  That is the company with a new take on endpoint management.
[47:23.920 --> 47:25.440]  And here's the simple question they ask,
[47:25.440 --> 47:28.560]  how can we get end users more involved?
[47:28.560 --> 47:30.960]  This is in contrast to the old school device management
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.640]  tools like MDM, which locked down your employees' devices
[47:34.640 --> 47:37.680]  without considering their needs at all or even attempting
[47:37.680 --> 47:40.880]  to educate them about the aspects of security
[47:40.880 --> 47:43.520]  that are the whole reason you want to do something
[47:43.520 --> 47:44.400]  with their laptops.
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.080]  And what happens, a lot of cases with traditional MDM,
[47:48.080 --> 47:50.160]  is your employees, they take the work laptop,
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.920]  see how locked down it is, and they just
[47:51.920 --> 47:53.920]  use their personal laptop for work stuff
[47:53.920 --> 47:56.560]  with no protections at all, defeating the whole point.
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.080]  Instead of locking down the device,
[48:00.080 --> 48:02.400]  Collide takes a user-focused approach
[48:02.400 --> 48:04.640]  that communicates security recommendations
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.920]  to your employees directly on Slack, the communication
[48:07.920 --> 48:09.200]  tool you're already using.
[48:09.200 --> 48:11.600]  You're not even asking them to sign up for something
[48:11.600 --> 48:12.800]  else to get notifications.
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.960]  It all goes through Slack, which you're already using.
[48:14.960 --> 48:17.120]  After you start using Collide, device security
[48:17.120 --> 48:18.800]  turns from a black and white state
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.400]  into a dynamic conversation.
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.000]  It starts with the end users installing the endpoint agent
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.720]  on their own, and then they go through a guided process
[48:26.720 --> 48:29.440]  that happens right inside their first Slack message.
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.520]  And from there, Collide regularly
[48:31.520 --> 48:33.440]  sends your employees recommendations
[48:33.440 --> 48:36.320]  when their device is in an insecure state
[48:36.320 --> 48:38.320]  or if they just have recommendations to make.
[48:38.320 --> 48:41.760]  Just, hey, you've got a file full of passwords
[48:41.760 --> 48:43.520]  and a text file in your downloads folder.
[48:43.520 --> 48:45.120]  You should do something about that.
[48:45.120 --> 48:50.080]  That's Collide, K-O-L-I-D-E, cross-platform endpoint
[48:50.080 --> 48:53.520]  management for Linux, Mac, and Windows devices
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.200]  that puts end users first for teams that Slack.

[49:22.080 --> 49:24.160]  shouldn't wait a couple of weeks after WWDC
[49:24.160 --> 49:27.440]  to have my first regular show after the live show.
[49:27.440 --> 49:29.840]  And then here we are a couple of weeks later,
[49:29.840 --> 49:30.800]  and it's my first show.
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.400]  But on the other hand, it is clarifying.
[49:34.400 --> 49:38.240]  It is like, and it's always the reason
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.080]  I'm so stressed out about my live show,
[49:40.080 --> 49:42.640]  doing it like on Tuesday, the day after the keynote,
[49:42.640 --> 49:45.120]  is everything they've announced and plus things
[49:45.120 --> 49:46.640]  they didn't even announce in the keynote
[49:46.640 --> 49:48.720]  but I've learned about from the State of the Union
[49:48.720 --> 49:50.880]  or just bumping into people and, hey,
[49:50.880 --> 49:54.160]  did you hear about X, which makes sense
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.040]  that it wasn't in the keynote but is some obscure thing
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.560]  that I really care about.
[49:58.560 --> 50:00.480]  And my head's filled with ideas.
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.120]  My notebook's filled with stuff that's not necessarily
[50:03.120 --> 50:04.640]  in any kind of order.
[50:04.640 --> 50:06.240]  And it's hard to organize it.
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.320]  Time is such a wonderful sifter.
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.800]  I feel like I have a much better perspective
[50:10.800 --> 50:12.720]  on what was a big deal, what wasn't.
[50:12.720 --> 50:13.280]  I'm curious.
[50:15.040 --> 50:16.800]  For my show with Mike Hurley, Upgrade,
[50:17.600 --> 50:20.560]  we tried to do it right after as close to the event as possible.
[50:20.560 --> 50:22.880]  And I think there's value in being there
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.240]  as the first voices and the quick hit right afterward.
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.640]  But doing it is really in a bubble of all we know
[50:30.640 --> 50:31.680]  is what was at the keynote.
[50:31.680 --> 50:34.320]  And we know that all the Apple.com web pages
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.280]  have more information.
[50:35.840 --> 50:38.880]  And then for WWDC, the sessions have more information.
[50:38.880 --> 50:40.880]  And it's always a first cut at it,
[50:40.880 --> 50:42.240]  which is big reactions.
[50:42.240 --> 50:44.560]  And one of my favorite episodes we ever do
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.200]  is the week following because it's all the other stuff.
[50:47.200 --> 50:48.240]  It's all the details.
[50:48.240 --> 50:50.800]  And it's all the big picture of now
[50:50.800 --> 50:52.480]  that we've had a week to think over it.
[50:52.480 --> 50:55.360]  And it really does put in sharp relief
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.840]  the difference between walking out of a keynote
[50:58.480 --> 51:01.760]  and having some time to think about it.
[51:01.760 --> 51:04.320]  And they both have their advantages.
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.000]  But yeah, it really does benefit from learning all the details
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.520]  and getting time to kind of ponder.
[51:11.120 --> 51:13.760]  I keep thinking about Stage Manager, actually.
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.320]  It is what strikes me about so having used the betas
[51:18.320 --> 51:18.800]  a little bit.
[51:18.800 --> 51:20.240]  I mean, Stage Manager is fascinating
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.880]  because it is the solution to one problem that
[51:22.880 --> 51:27.840]  has been asked but not answered for years now,
[51:27.840 --> 51:29.280]  which is iPad multitasking.
[51:29.840 --> 51:32.800]  And it is also yet another solution
[51:32.800 --> 51:35.920]  to a constant problem that has been asked and answered
[51:35.920 --> 51:38.800]  repeatedly, but not to anyone's satisfaction,
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.920]  apparently, which is macOS window management.
[51:41.920 --> 51:45.680]  And the fact that you dug up that the, you know,
[51:45.680 --> 51:49.120]  somebody leaked something that then they retracted
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.960]  that this was a project that they were talking
[51:50.960 --> 51:56.800]  about 15 years ago inside Apple as a window manager.
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.160]  And I'm fascinated that what got it over the hump,
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.000]  I believe, is that it was an interesting solution
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.840]  to the iPad problem of grouping windows together.
[52:07.840 --> 52:09.760]  And yet they also deployed it on the Mac.
[52:09.760 --> 52:10.880]  And of course, the way they announced it
[52:10.880 --> 52:12.240]  is they announced it for the Mac.
[52:12.240 --> 52:14.720]  And I said to everyone around me at the event,
[52:14.720 --> 52:17.360]  I was like, well, that's iPad multitasking right there.
[52:17.360 --> 52:18.720]  And then they got a lot of nods.
[52:18.720 --> 52:20.000]  Everybody was like, yep, that's it.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.440]  We knew what was coming.
[52:21.440 --> 52:24.240]  But what interests me is how it will be received.
[52:24.240 --> 52:26.320]  And it's early ed in the betas and all of that.
[52:26.320 --> 52:30.640]  Because my brief usage of these in beta, what it tells me
[52:30.640 --> 52:34.080]  is that Stage Manager does not stand or fall
[52:35.040 --> 52:39.440]  based on the concept of Stage Manager,
[52:39.440 --> 52:44.800]  but it stands or falls based on the underlying window
[52:45.360 --> 52:47.680]  infrastructure of the operating system.
[52:47.680 --> 52:50.480]  Because I used Stage Manager on the Mac.
[52:51.200 --> 52:53.760]  And I was like, oh, yeah, I can see how this.
[52:53.760 --> 52:55.440]  I don't use spaces or anything like that.
[52:55.440 --> 52:57.200]  I'm like, oh, well, this way, it's not out of sight,
[52:57.200 --> 52:57.680]  out of mind.
[52:57.680 --> 53:00.560]  You talked about that on the talk show interview
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.600]  at the event, right?
[53:01.600 --> 53:04.960]  Is I have a problem with spaces because if it's out of sight,
[53:04.960 --> 53:05.600]  it's out of mind.
[53:05.600 --> 53:07.280]  And I want to keep my eye on it.
[53:07.280 --> 53:10.160]  And Stage Manager lets you kind of keep your eye on it
[53:10.160 --> 53:12.480]  while also working with, I think, how a lot of people work,
[53:12.480 --> 53:15.600]  which is with groups of apps or groups of windows
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.520]  and kind of switching between them.
[53:17.520 --> 53:19.120]  And so on the Mac, I was like, you know,
[53:19.120 --> 53:22.160]  I don't know if I would use this all the time,
[53:22.720 --> 53:25.440]  but I can see the value of this.
[53:25.440 --> 53:27.840]  And I know Apple has strived for years.
[53:27.840 --> 53:30.720]  They must have a lot of feedback from users
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.880]  and from observing users that people still
[53:32.880 --> 53:34.640]  struggle with window management on the Mac,
[53:34.640 --> 53:39.040]  that non-expert users lose windows under other windows,
[53:39.040 --> 53:40.640]  and they get frustrated by it.
[53:40.640 --> 53:42.000]  And they are constantly trying.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.160]  You got to give them credit that with all these things
[53:44.160 --> 53:46.480]  they've tried, they don't think that they figured out
[53:46.480 --> 53:47.440]  window management yet.
[53:47.440 --> 53:49.520]  They didn't say like, oh, with the Mac, we solved it.
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.160]  It's over.
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.000]  They're like, no, they still don't
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.200]  think that they've solved it.
[53:53.840 --> 53:56.560]  On the iPad, though, it's the same.
[53:56.560 --> 53:58.400]  It's like literally the same thing.
[53:58.400 --> 54:01.280]  And yet, at least in the early betas,
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.640]  it doesn't quite work.
[54:04.640 --> 54:06.240]  And that was really instructive to me
[54:06.240 --> 54:07.920]  because I realized the problem is they're
[54:07.920 --> 54:10.320]  putting it on an operating system that
[54:10.320 --> 54:15.200]  doesn't have 30 years of window management thought.
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.480]  And it has a year maybe or two of window management
[54:20.480 --> 54:23.520]  thought of any kind or anything resembling window management.
[54:23.520 --> 54:25.360]  And I'm fascinated by that.
[54:25.360 --> 54:27.120]  And also, I think that in the end,
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.040]  maybe if we're posing, if we're thinking
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.640]  about center stage as the thing to focus on in terms
[54:32.640 --> 54:35.040]  of the development of the iPad, maybe we're
[54:35.040 --> 54:36.400]  looking in the wrong place.
[54:36.400 --> 54:38.240]  Because I don't think it's center stage itself.
[54:38.240 --> 54:40.320]  I think it's like, how do you move windows?
[54:40.320 --> 54:41.840]  How do you minimize windows?
[54:41.840 --> 54:43.040]  How do you close windows?
[54:43.040 --> 54:46.960]  And that's the part that there's no infrastructure in iPad
[54:46.960 --> 54:49.120]  OS for any of that stuff.
[54:49.120 --> 54:52.320]  And so this summer, because it's not all there even now
[54:52.320 --> 54:55.360]  in the betas, they're going to have to invent that.
[54:55.360 --> 54:56.560]  Whereas the Macs just got it.
[54:56.560 --> 54:59.120]  And so center stage is like, oh, this is kind of cool.
[54:59.120 --> 55:00.960]  And on the iPad, it's like, oh, well, yeah,
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.240]  but how do I minimize a window or close a window
[55:06.240 --> 55:07.120]  with a keyboard shortcut?
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.200]  And the answer is, I don't know.
[55:09.200 --> 55:10.240]  They just don't know.
[55:10.240 --> 55:12.880]  You just called it center stage three times.
[55:12.880 --> 55:13.760]  Sorry, I did it again.
[55:13.760 --> 55:16.160]  I've been doing it nonstop.
[55:16.160 --> 55:17.120]  I can't believe I did.
[55:17.120 --> 55:17.840]  Center stage manager.
[55:17.840 --> 55:20.720]  I'm pretty sure I did not do it once in my live show.
[55:20.720 --> 55:22.000]  And I was so happy I didn't.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.800]  But I do think it's a bad name.
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.760]  And not in and of itself, but it is a bad name alongside center stage,
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.800]  because in both cases, what the stage is is entirely different.
[55:34.800 --> 55:37.040]  In center stage, the thing with the camera,
[55:37.040 --> 55:38.880]  where you can move around in front of your iPad
[55:38.880 --> 55:41.440]  or your studio display and the camera pans
[55:41.440 --> 55:48.560]  because it's ultra wide, the stage is your real world space
[55:48.560 --> 55:53.440]  where your sack of meat with teeth that is yourself
[55:53.440 --> 55:56.480]  is operating, your kitchen, your office,
[55:56.480 --> 55:59.840]  wherever the hell you are, it is the actual real world
[55:59.840 --> 56:01.440]  where you are in front of a camera.
[56:02.240 --> 56:06.320]  In stage manager, the stage is the screen,
[56:07.040 --> 56:08.640]  which could not be more opposite.
[56:08.640 --> 56:11.360]  It is through the looking glass,
[56:11.360 --> 56:13.440]  but they're calling both of them the stage.
[56:14.160 --> 56:17.760]  And it is very confusing, right?
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.200]  Like we all have real world desktops
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.320]  if you work in an office with a desk.
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.080]  But Apple has never called things the desktop feature
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.160]  as to where to put your mouse.
[56:30.160 --> 56:32.400]  They don't emphasize that you put it on the desktop.
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.880]  It's the desktop in Apple's parlance
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.920]  is the background wallpaper of your Mac behind all your windows.
[56:41.920 --> 56:42.800]  That's the desktop.
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.160]  And then there's clarity.
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.000]  This stage manager center stage thing, I keep doing it.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.560]  I'm so glad you made the mistake first so I can call you out.
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.360]  But I know that I'm going to do it.
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.040]  It's impossible to keep straight.
[56:56.240 --> 57:00.640]  And Apple likes cute names and cute names that are metaphors.
[57:00.640 --> 57:02.240]  And so I see what they're doing here.
[57:02.240 --> 57:04.240]  It was a mistake to, I think, maybe roll these out
[57:04.240 --> 57:05.360]  so close to each other.
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.920]  I wonder if a more prosaic name for this feature
[57:07.920 --> 57:11.440]  would be better if it was called something like window manager
[57:11.440 --> 57:13.840]  or window sets or something like that,
[57:13.840 --> 57:18.480]  where it's just what it does, because that's what it is.
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.360]  And again, I admire them for doing they did expose.
[57:23.360 --> 57:24.400]  And then they said, well, now we're
[57:24.400 --> 57:25.920]  going to call it mission control.
[57:25.920 --> 57:27.280]  And it includes these other things.
[57:27.280 --> 57:29.600]  And they keep trying to come up with ways
[57:29.600 --> 57:30.800]  to make this stuff work.
[57:30.800 --> 57:34.000]  And I appreciate that they keep trying.
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.360]  But yeah, the name isn't great.
[57:35.360 --> 57:37.600]  And the feature, like I said, I was surprised.
[57:37.600 --> 57:39.360]  I was expecting to hate the feature on the Mac.
[57:39.360 --> 57:41.440]  And I was like, actually, I can see
[57:41.440 --> 57:42.880]  how this might actually fit with how
[57:42.880 --> 57:45.200]  a lot of people use their Macs, which
[57:45.200 --> 57:46.800]  is in these little window groups.
[57:46.800 --> 57:49.120]  But they want to have them accessible and not
[57:49.120 --> 57:51.200]  hidden in an invisible space.
[57:51.200 --> 57:52.080]  That's all good.
[57:52.080 --> 57:54.800]  It's just that on the iPad, you literally
[57:54.800 --> 57:58.960]  can't do Command-W to close a window, which is just not
[57:58.960 --> 57:59.200]  there.
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.280]  The infrastructure beneath it isn't there.
[58:01.280 --> 58:01.520]  Yeah.
[58:01.520 --> 58:04.480]  Window manager, if they called me up right now and said,
[58:04.480 --> 58:06.720]  all right, smart ass, we listen to you and Snill
[58:06.720 --> 58:09.440]  on your podcast, what do you think we should call it?
[58:09.440 --> 58:10.960]  And I can give them one answer.
[58:10.960 --> 58:13.120]  I guess I would say window manager.
[58:13.120 --> 58:15.600]  I think desktop manager would be a great name.
[58:15.600 --> 58:18.240]  I'm stealing that from blogger and listener
[58:18.240 --> 58:21.200]  of the show, Jack Wellborn, who wrote a,
[58:21.200 --> 58:23.280]  I still haven't linked to it, but it's a good post,
[58:23.280 --> 58:26.240]  arguing, just bitching about the name for the same reason
[58:26.240 --> 58:29.840]  I just did, that stage shouldn't mean two entirely
[58:29.840 --> 58:30.400]  different things.
[58:30.400 --> 58:31.440]  You're going to conflate them.
[58:31.440 --> 58:32.720]  The problem with desktop manager.
[58:32.720 --> 58:35.040]  Window sets is what I'm going to throw in there.
[58:35.040 --> 58:36.720]  Because it's literally, that's what it is.
[58:36.720 --> 58:39.120]  It's different sets of windows that you switch among.
[58:39.120 --> 58:40.720]  And that's what it is.
[58:40.720 --> 58:42.160]  Yeah, you kind of group them together.
[58:42.160 --> 58:43.840]  And then you switch between the sets.
[58:43.840 --> 58:44.640]  Window groups?
[58:44.640 --> 58:46.080]  Yeah, windows groups, windows sets,
[58:46.080 --> 58:47.520]  something windows, something.
[58:47.520 --> 58:52.560]  I think desktop manager, it works for me,
[58:52.560 --> 58:54.480]  but I can see why Apple would say,
[58:54.480 --> 58:57.920]  we can't use that because that would work on the Mac,
[58:57.920 --> 59:00.480]  but doesn't work on the iPad because the iPad doesn't
[59:00.480 --> 59:01.600]  have a desktop, right?
[59:01.600 --> 59:03.600]  Like you can't put things on your,
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.760]  you know, it has a home screen instead of a desktop.
[59:06.320 --> 59:09.200]  And you know, that distinction is important.
[59:09.200 --> 59:11.280]  You know, the desktop, actually, everybody
[59:11.280 --> 59:12.720]  knows what it is on the Mac.
[59:12.720 --> 59:14.960]  And it's a place where you can put files, some people
[59:14.960 --> 59:17.120]  put lots and lots of files on their desktop.
[59:17.120 --> 59:20.560]  And therefore, it's an important concept to people.
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.400]  So I could see why they'd shy away from it.
[59:22.400 --> 59:24.880]  But stage to me is the wrong metaphor.
[59:24.880 --> 59:26.000]  It doesn't seem like a stage.
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.920]  But anyway, I haven't used it on the Mac nearly as much
[59:29.920 --> 59:32.000]  as I have on iPad because I haven't installed
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.760]  on the iPad Air review unit that I still haven't sent back
[59:35.760 --> 59:37.440]  from a couple of months ago.
[59:37.440 --> 59:38.640]  Same, same.
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.920]  But I did play around with it briefly back
[59:41.920 --> 59:43.280]  when I was in California.
[59:43.280 --> 59:44.720]  And I could see it, you know?
[59:44.720 --> 59:46.400]  And I really appreciate it.
[59:46.400 --> 59:48.720]  It was one of my favorite moments from my live show
[59:48.720 --> 59:50.880]  where Federighi, when we talked about it,
[59:50.880 --> 59:54.720]  emphasized that when they introduce new things,
[59:54.720 --> 59:57.600]  and Stage Manager is just one of them,
[59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.160]  when they introduce new things like Expos and Spaces,
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.920]  it's never to say, if you're happy with the way
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.920]  you've been working on the Mac, we're
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.680]  not taking that away from you.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.080]  And we're not saying that what you're doing is wrong.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.400]  But we're enabling people who didn't like it for a reason
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.680]  to have an alternative.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.800]  And I think that's great.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.160]  And I think it has worked out.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.440]  And I said on my show, you said you feel the same way.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.680]  Spaces has never clicked for me.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.280]  And it never will because it's not how my brain works.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.960]  And I can work with two.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.280]  I have, in the past, worked with two displays.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.480]  I can imagine working with three displays
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.000]  and thinking, my email is on the left.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.160]  And when I did have two displays,
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.520]  that's where I put my email.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.800]  It was on the left display.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.000]  And I think spatially.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.720]  And when I want to check my email, or copy from the email,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.040]  or drag from a message I know I had opened from a minute ago,
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.320]  I turn my head to the left.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.280]  There it is.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:53.840]  And I drag it.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.760]  When I try to do that with Spaces,
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.280]  I just never look at my email.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.280]  It's gone.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.560]  It's off into space.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.040]  And the space can be over on the left.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.040]  I just don't go there.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.040]  And then I Command Tab to Mail.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.680]  And I'm still in the second space.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.760]  And Mail doesn't come forward, really.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.760]  It activates the menu bar.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.800]  And it's static.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.120]  It's like getting an electric shock to my brain.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:19.600]  Where is it?
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.560]  Why isn't it here?
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.120]  I don't know.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:21.760]  It has never worked like that.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.600]  It's like your stuff is on a second monitor
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.960]  that is unplugged.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.240]  Meanwhile, I know that there are lots and lots of people
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  who love Spaces, couldn't live without it.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.000]  It's good that they're not taking it away.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.960]  It's not a replacement.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.240]  It's additive.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.720]  But I do think having used it on the iPad
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.880]  for a couple of weeks now in beta,
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:47.200]  I can see using it, but I do think what shows.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.640]  I don't think it's unsolvable.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.680]  But I think it makes it a very difficult proposition
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.280]  for Apple to get right.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.320]  And at this point, the clock's ticking, right?
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.920]  Because it's going to be shipping software
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.040]  come September or October at the latest.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.880]  You know, there's not a lot of time to make significant changes.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:12.960]  But I think what really shows is where the platform started,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.480]  where the Mac started with just overlapping windows.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.800]  And I mean, if you go back far enough,
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800]  you only had one app at a time.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.440]  But that's so far in the past in the 80s that the idea.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440]  Your windows stack on top of each other.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.000]  And if you have multiple applications,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.080]  visible at once, the windows for all those applications
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.480]  that are open are all stacked on top of each other.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.360]  And that's the starting concept.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.600]  And yes, and it seems to me like Craig Federighi personally
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.160]  is annoyed by the clutter and the, for lack of a better term,
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.880]  janitorial work of cleaning up that mess.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.520]  But that is clearly shared by many other people.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.520]  And I think going back to Steve Jobs,
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.320]  who clearly was a major force behind the purple button.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.480]  Did Federighi bring that up in my show?
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.360]  I think he might have.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:07.840]  Yeah, he did.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.240]  Yeah, single window mode or whatever it was.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:17.840]  It was only in DP3, Developer Preview 3 of Mac OS X around 2000 or 2001.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.720]  John Siracusa was, of course, remembers it because he was writing,
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.760]  because he was writing 25-page reviews for Ars Technica of each of those.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.880]  Every single release.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.280]  One of those developer releases added what seems crazy.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.360]  There was the red, yellow, green buttons all along in Mac OS X
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.000]  that do what the red, yellow, green buttons do today.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.800]  But then there was a purple button over in the other corner.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.720]  And that triggered single window mode,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.120]  which meant there's only one window at a time.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.880]  And the other windows weren't closed.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.080]  They just weren't shown.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:53.520]  And then you'd click the other app in the dock.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.680]  Or if you were in the same application that had multiple windows open,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.160]  there'd be some other way to get to one of those other windows.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.480]  But when you activated one of those other windows in single window mode,
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.000]  the current window went away.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.520]  And then that window came up, and you had one thing at a time to focus on.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.520]  In concept, that sounds great.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.360]  Stage Manager seems to address the similar need.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.960]  The problem with that single window mode back 22 years ago was,
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.480]  in practice, it didn't really work that well.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.520]  In a system that was kind of starting point was,
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.560]  you could have dozens and dozens of windows at a time from multiple applications.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.200]  And the iPad has the opposite problem,
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.800]  where it started with literal single window mode, right?
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.760]  There was no split screen for years and years and years on iPad.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.480]  It was go back to the home screen, open up an app, and the app got the whole screen.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.920]  That screen was the window.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.400]  The window was the screen, and that's it.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.000]  And there's much good things to speak about that.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.400]  And it's clearly a major reason why the iPad is so popular
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.240]  with so many people of various technical inclination.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.600]  For people who are savvy and technically savvy,
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.920]  and can and do also use the Mac or Windows or whatever else,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.240]  and have dozens and dozens of windows on screen at a time,
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.960]  it just brings focus, right?
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:24.080]  Focus is like a big part of a lot of people's desire for changing their workflow, right?
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.720]  Like, I feel scattered, hard to concentrate.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.600]  I would just like to write this article or this big, long, important email.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.720]  I just want to focus on it.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.080]  Just show me one thing at a time.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.040]  Lots of apps do it.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.080]  It's a great feature.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.720]  But the iPad starting from that, as the concept behind the whole system,
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  to get to this, there's an uncanny valley to it.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.120]  I don't know.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.640]  And maybe one way of putting it is, why not just put red, yellow, green buttons
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.880]  on the iPad windows when it's in this mode?
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.120]  Well, I think they put the little lozenge at the top of iPad windows,
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.480]  but you have to click it to reveal what the controls are,
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.840]  which I think is a mistake.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.760]  I think that when you're in this mode, they should be visible all the time.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.280]  And I know that that's like, or when you move your pointer over it,
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.480]  if you're using the pointer.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.120]  But I think that's where they're going to have to go,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.960]  is that they need keyboard shortcuts, and they need visual affordances
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.000]  for window management.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.680]  And that's the challenge, right?
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.840]  Is that in any of these things, it's like, well, on the Mac,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.720]  you can look at the window menu or whatever.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.360]  But on the iPad, there isn't one.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.120]  So that's why they have to grow these things, and they can make their choices.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.200]  And I like the idea that this is, like the pointer support on iPadOS,
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.720]  it is a modern take on multi-window interface.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:49.680]  It's accepting that the Mac has a good thing in having a multi-window interface,
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.520]  but that we're going to do a modern take on it.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.600]  Because I think the pointer support on iPadOS is fantastic, right?
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.240]  It's like we didn't just ape the Mac.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.280]  We did an iPad version of a pointer that is like what we would do
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.520]  when we were building the pointer today.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.880]  And I think the windowing is what they're trying to do is the same thing.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:12.160]  It's just they're missing a bunch of pieces of it.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.240]  And now, as you said, the clock is ticking.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.960]  And it's like, are we going to have a debate about whether that little widget
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.360]  can unfurl or stays open by default so that I have control over it?
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.000]  Like, do we need title bars on iPad windows?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.200]  Because we sort of don't have them, but we sort of do.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.360]  Like that's all the, again, I think that stage manager,
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.320]  it got it right that time, is not the issue about it.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.320]  Like, I think the stage manager concept is not bad.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.960]  It's like, how do you do windowing on iPad?
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.080]  And that's where it's still kind of not all there.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.720]  And that's what their summer, I feel like, is going to be.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.600]  It's funny, you mentioned single window mode and there's full screen mode,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.120]  which the Mac has had for a long time,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.840]  and people wanting to do focus modes in their apps.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.680]  One thing that struck me about stage manager to get back to the Mac for a second
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.920]  is when I saw it at the keynote, the first thing I thought was,
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.880]  this is an acceptance of the fact that full screen mode on the Mac
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.760]  doesn't work very well.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.000]  And I know there are people who like full screen mode,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.640]  but like when they showed that you can click on the desktop
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.680]  and it brings the desktop up because people keep stuff on the desktop,
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.240]  I thought, ah, see, this is it.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.520]  Because every time I try full screen mode with apps that I think
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.560]  should probably be in full screen, like Logic or Final Cut,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.200]  I need to get a file somewhere.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.200]  It's like, oh, I can't get it.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.120]  So I'm like, I got to get out of full screen mode
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.640]  or I got to show the desktop or whatever.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.160]  And I looked at center stage and I thought, oh, this is,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.240]  we're going to give you, sorry, I called it center stage.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.240]  Stage manager, this is us saying, well, if you want one big window, that's fine.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.640]  But you can also click and get your desktop.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.200]  Like, yes, yes, that's what we want.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.360]  So it's like a less extreme full screen mode if you want it to be.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.280]  And I think that's, I think that's better.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.000]  I think that's a better approach, at least for some tasks.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.160]  Because yeah, I keep things on my desktop or I want to open a finder window
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.600]  and drag a file in and when you're in full screen mode,
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  the OS is basically saying, nope, you will only live in this one app.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.160]  And there are lots of jobs where you live in two apps
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.080]  or you just need two windows.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.560]  And so having the system manage those, I'm excited about that part.
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.440]  But again, the Mac is much better at all of that than the iPad is.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.000]  And it's not stage manager's fault.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.320]  It's the rest of the OS not being built around windows.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.400]  Yeah, yeah, totally.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.720]  And I do like it though overall.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.360]  It is kind of fun when you get in the zone,
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.800]  like for me in the morning,
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.120]  if I'm just catching up on email, Safari and messages,
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.400]  to have all three of them visible like windows,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.080]  like I put Safari in the middle and mail sticking out,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.280]  like when Safari is active,
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.640]  a little bit on the left and messages a little bit on the right.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.840]  I like it a lot.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.440]  It is a nice way to bang between those three apps.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.640]  And I like the spatial orientation.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.720]  It's very pleasing to me,
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:12.240]  but it also feels to me like why is split screen still around?
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:14.240]  Like at one point I was like,
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.600]  what happens when I have all these,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.200]  when I'm using stage manager,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.000]  what happens if I go back to control center and turn it off?
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.880]  And it's like, it puts you in split screen with,
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.440]  if you have three apps currently like in your set,
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.840]  like the two most recently used ones become a split screen pair.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.760]  And it's like, why, why, why?
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.200]  I'm not sure that was the right decision.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.440]  It just feels weird.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.480]  But of course, which leads us into the next part,
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.320]  part of the stage manager discussion,
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.760]  the stage manager gate part of,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.960]  well, of course split screen has to still be there in the OS
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.000]  because the vast majority of iPads in use
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.080]  don't qualify for stage manager yet
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.800]  because it's an M1 iPad only feature.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.880]  So I get it, but it's like,
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.480]  it just, I don't know.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.760]  There's a, I like stage manager a lot to me.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.040]  It's the biggest conceptual change to iPad OS
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.840]  since they've switched from being single window,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.160]  all screen all the time that I really like,
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.440]  yet it also feels bolted on because it's coming on to me
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.760]  an unsteady conceptual foundation.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.440]  Yeah, that's, I think, I think that's the,
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.920]  that's the challenge with stage manager on the iPad.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.040]  iPad is, is what do you really, okay.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.720]  Now that we've all admitted that there are windows
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.880]  on the iPad, what do they look like?
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.920]  How do they interact?
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.160]  How do, how do apps gather their own windows?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.440]  Do they know about them?
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.520]  How can I, how can I manage windows on iPad?
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.600]  And like a lot of those questions have been left
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:50.400]  as an exercise for the user, right?
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.560]  Like, I don't know, let's think about it.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.000]  And now it's like, well, now it's real.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.640]  And what is, what's the answer?
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.760]  And it feels like there isn't one or it's half of an answer
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.080]  or it's sort of a, you know, in progress,
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.240]  check back later in another beta kind of thing.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.480]  And that's the, that's what we're all kind of waiting for.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.640]  Like, cause in, in, in iPad OS 15,
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.760]  if you have multiple windows open,
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.360]  you can like touch the, cause there are windows.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.600]  They're just multitasking weird windows.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.480]  You touch the icon for the app in the dock
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.200]  and it will show you what windows exist, which is like,
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.280]  okay, that's something, but it's still kind of weird.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.720]  And I still don't think it does a thing
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.240]  that makes sense in iPad OS 16.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.160]  So it's like, you know, that's, that's,
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.600]  that's what I want is, is I'm not,
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.000]  the early betas don't suggest to me that Apple knows
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.440]  what the metaphor for iPad windows is.
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.840]  It's more like, look, we built a window manager.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.280]  Now we got to figure out the window part.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.800]  I mentioned this on my live show,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.600]  but a friend of the show, friend, your friend,
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.160]  everybody's friend, the internet's friend, Matthew Pansarino
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  observed right after the keynote
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.480]  that if they had debuted stage manager,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.600]  iPad only three or four years ago,
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.320]  the people who feared for the Mac's future
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.560]  would have lost their minds because they would have said,
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.800]  this is it they're there.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.000]  They've added this feature.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:10.720]  Game over, man.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.480]  They've added this feature to iPad
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.880]  because they're going to discontinue the Mac.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.720]  And this is their answer for Mac users who would
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.800]  in that hypothetical scenario, need to switch to the iPad
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.120]  as their main computer, if they wanted to stay
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.240]  on an Apple platform.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.440]  And I think he's right that it would have only added fuel
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.440]  to that, it turns out incorrect fear,
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.520]  but now when everybody is, everybody who's a Mac fan
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.880]  is, is incredibly confident about Apple's commitment
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.600]  to the platform with the whole Apple Silicon initiative
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.280]  and how amazingly well it's gone.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.080]  And just the keyboards that work
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.760]  and other things that have improved since four years ago.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.760]  I think what we're left with is the truth,
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:04.720]  which is that the iPad is the sort of forgotten platform,
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.920]  not forgotten, but the one that gets the least attention.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:14.160]  The iPhone is the billion user product that has turned Apple
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.560]  from a smaller peripheral player in the industry
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.600]  to the biggest, literally the biggest company in the world.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.800]  The Mac, they've shown their commitment
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.880]  and it remains the, to use my now very old analogy,
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.440]  the platform that's heavy so that the other platforms
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.560]  can remain light conceptually, the one that the workhorse,
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.480]  the workstation, the iPad is still third
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.880]  in their mind and attention, right?
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.200]  Like if some Thanos type situation came
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.840]  and a bad guy could snap their finger
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.480]  and make the Mac disappear and that they had to make
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.320]  the iPad be, do more of the things the Mac did,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.360]  it would be better than it is today.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.880]  And you can kind of see that, right?
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.000]  It's still sort of, you could just see the gaps
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.120]  between these concepts.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.960]  Just, there's a lot of, there's so much work to be done
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.440]  with stage manager before it ships.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:12.960]  Yeah, it is.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.600]  I mean, it puts, you think about Safari last year
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.160]  and you're like, wow, oh, there's a lot more.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.680]  And honestly, not just before it ships,
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.200]  but presumably after, right?
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.400]  Like I feel like they need to keep refining iPad windowing
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.680]  for a while now, but you're right.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.280]  Yeah, there would have been a lot of doom and gloom.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.560]  I think it'd be like, oh, they're doing it.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.680]  They're copying everything on the Mac.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.200]  And I think that Apple maybe views the iPad
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.720]  as the place where they're building very slowly.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.680]  They're building their vision for what the future
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.320]  of the Mac looks like too.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.040]  The future of computing looks like long-term,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.560]  but at least the last few years have made it clear
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.720]  that it's not short-term that like the Mac,
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.200]  the Mac is going to be, if the Mac ends up being
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.040]  essentially a super set of iPadOS in the long run,
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.160]  and that you can more seamlessly move between modes,
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.120]  then so be it.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.120]  But like iPadOS just isn't there yet.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.840]  You know, they need, there's more that work
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.520]  that needs to be done before they ever could get
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.160]  to that point.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.840]  And I like that they're going there
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.440]  because I think that they're gonna create something.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.880]  They have the potential to create something
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.960]  that is that like modern take on,
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.680]  it's the 2024 take on 1984, let's say,
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.120]  something like that, right?
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.480]  I think that's cool, but thank goodness it's not a Thanos,
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.480]  like I'm gonna snap and one of these things
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.280]  is gonna disappear because it's not there yet.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.520]  Even as somebody who loves the iPad and working
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.720]  on the iPad and loves the progression that's happening here,
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.760]  it's just not there.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.720]  There's so much of it that the Mac brings
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.240]  that the iPad can't do yet.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.000]  And vice versa is also true, but like they're just not,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.600]  this is a big hurdle for them.
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.440]  This is a big step for them and it's hard
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.880]  and it's gonna take some time I think.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.720]  Yeah, I just think in hindsight,
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.480]  we were worried about the wrong platform,
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.440]  but I think it's gonna become clear now
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.880]  and it's the iPad that still, it has so much potential,
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.200]  like it has more potential ahead of it
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.720]  than it does already have behind it, right?
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.200]  Whereas I'm not saying the Mac's best days are behind it,
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.600]  but the Mac is 40 years old almost.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.520]  It is conceptually the very definition
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.120]  of an established platform.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.440]  Yeah, it's a solved problem, right?
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.320]  It's a solved problem.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.880]  It does, the Mac makes sense and it does what it does
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.400]  and it doesn't mean that it can't be improved
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.080]  and the bugs can't be fixed, that's not what I'm saying.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.000]  But I am saying the Mac sort of has reached its final form
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.600]  in many ways and that what it gets now,
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.440]  it's getting in lockstep with the other platforms.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.000]  But like the Mac does the job that the Mac was meant to do.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.360]  You couldn't change the Mac now if you wanted to that much
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.000]  because its appeal is that it is the Mac.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.640]  And iPad is like, yeah, it's still like a lump of clay
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.520]  a little bit, like what does it wanna be in the end?
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.880]  And I don't know.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.040]  I also think though, it is safe to say
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.960]  that there was probably a moment there where Apple,
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.960]  and I know that they pooh-poohed this on the talk show,
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.040]  but like I think there was a moment there
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.760]  where Apple was confused about what it wanted the Mac to be.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.280]  Maybe the Mac wasn't gonna die.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.000]  For the 25th anniversary of the Mac,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:10.880]  30th anniversary of the Mac,
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.640]  I forget, I did an interview with Phil Schiller
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.480]  and he said, the Mac goes on forever.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.120]  That was literally what he said, the Mac goes on forever.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.160]  And I never doubt Apple's commitment to the Mac,
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.240]  but I do think that in that period,
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.280]  their commitment to what the Mac would be
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.320]  was kind of wavering.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.560]  Like, would it just be a legacy platform
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.360]  or would it be something that merges with iPad?
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.320]  And like, I think they didn't quite know
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:35.920]  what they wanted the Mac to be.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.600]  And I don't know exactly what happened,
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.040]  but I think they figured it out.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.840]  I think they decided this is what the Mac is gonna be.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.920]  And we have seen the fruits of that.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.600]  So it's not quite that they abandoned the Mac,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.320]  but I think there was like a real midlife crisis almost
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.920]  where they're like, what do we want the Mac to be?
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.840]  Where is it ending up?
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  Where do we wanna put our attention?
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:57.440]  And you couldn't miss it in the last five years
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.440]  that that has changed dramatically.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.080]  Yeah, their confidence in where and what the Mac should be
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.480]  shows in the actual Macs that we see today.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.720]  Let me take a break and thank our third sponsor.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.120]  It's our good friends at Linode.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.800]  Oh man, I love Linode.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.920]  They host my website not because they're a sponsor,
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.600]  but because I actually think they are the best place
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.680]  where I could possibly host Daring Fireball.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.560]  You can go to linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.760]  That's the URL and see why Linode has been voted
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.000]  the top infrastructure as a service provider
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.240]  by both G2 and TrustRadius from their award-winning support,
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.160]  which is offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.400]  365 days of every year to every level of user
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.640]  from the smallest account to the biggest
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.520]  to the ease of use of setup and configuration.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.720]  It is clear why developers have been trusting Linode
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.600]  for projects, both big and small since 2003.
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.480]  They have new stuff, new product release, databases.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:06.240]  MySQL started in May, MongoDB, Postgres, SQL in June.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.960]  It's fully managed database service
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.680]  for MySQL, Postgres, and MongoDB.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.600]  Redis, I think I'm pronouncing that right,
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.880]  R-E-D-I-S, Redis, Redis, probably guessing wrong.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.680]  Maybe it's Redis.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.400]  But anyway, support for that is coming later this year.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.240]  It is simple and reliable managed databases.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.680]  You can easily deploy high-performance database clusters.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.960]  Managed databases allow you to quickly deploy
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.320]  a new database and defer management tasks
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.840]  like configurations, managing high availability,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.360]  disaster recovery, backups, data replication.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.720]  With managed databases, you get fast and simple deployment,
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.640]  secure access, daily backups are included,
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.680]  and flexible plans, depending on your needs,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.920]  the size of your databases, how much access you need a day,
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.120]  that sort of thing.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.400]  Linode makes cloud computing fast, simple, and affordable,
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.640]  allowing you to focus on your projects,
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.160]  not your infrastructure.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.920]  Once again, the URL is linode, L-I-N-O-D-E,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.480]  linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.000]  Go there, use that URL, create a free account.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.840]  You can do that with your email address
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.600]  or sign in with Google or GitHub,
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.200]  and you will get a hundred bucks in credit
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.560]  just for going to linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:27.680]  As I waited to record this show post WWDC,
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.640]  I wondered how relevant the controversy
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.720]  over the M1 requirement for stage manager would remain.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.200]  It seems like it is as relevant as ever.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.400]  I was talking with you in a thread on Twitter the other day,
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.560]  and the thought popped into my head.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.240]  So anyway, for those who, God bless you,
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.080]  and I hope you've enjoyed your June.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.720]  But if you are unaware,
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.480]  this feature that we've been talking about,
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.680]  stage manager for iPad, is only available
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.760]  as announced at the keynote,
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.800]  and currently as we record with developer beta two,
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.920]  it's only available for iPads with an M1 chip,
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.320]  which I believe is just three iPads.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.120]  That's the iPad Pros 11 and 12.9 inches
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.200]  from last year, 2021,
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.120]  and the iPad Air fifth generation,
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.760]  which came out, I think, in April of this year.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.120]  Maybe it was announced in March,
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.960]  but it's a couple of months old.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.520]  Those three are the only ones that have an M1,
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.280]  so they're the only ones with the feature,
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:31.280]  and Federighi got asked by it, by a few, about it,
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.800]  in a few interviews he did during WWDC week,
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.120]  and the explanation came down to they,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.680]  basically, I don't want to put words in his mouth,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.400]  but their envisioning of the M1
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.960]  and the visioning of the feature
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.080]  requires everything that you can see in stage manager
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.200]  to remain active so that when you do switch,
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.560]  you don't have to wait at all
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.440]  for anything that maybe got, you know,
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.000]  when you multitask on iOS,
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:01.600]  and by iOS, I mean iPhone and iPad traditionally,
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.040]  apps that are in the background can get killed
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.920]  so that the system can reuse the RAM
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.080]  and whatever other resources they were using,
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.600]  and then when you go back to them,
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.480]  with command tab or clicking their icon on the home screen,
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.560]  they technically relaunched, but they were frozen,
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.640]  and so they just kind of thaw back to right where they were,
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.000]  and it happens fast enough
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.680]  that you kind of don't even notice,
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.640]  and you just, you know, it just works, supposedly, you know,
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.160]  and I think it truthfully has.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.320]  Basically, though, the explanation is
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.440]  it needs the M1 to do everything they want it to do,
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.320]  and part of that is swap, virtual memory swap,
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.440]  which has never been available on iOS before.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.320]  That's one of the reasons iOS freezes applications
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.520]  in the background,
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.760]  as opposed to just letting everything just run.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.000]  Swap is basically, it sounds actually,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.920]  it's pretty easy to explain in layperson's terms,
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.040]  where RAM, let's say you have eight gigs of RAM
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.840]  on the device you're running, and all eight is used up,
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.480]  but something on the system needs more memory,
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.120]  it'll just take something that isn't currently being used
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.520]  and write that portion of the RAM to the storage,
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.120]  which used to be a spinning hard disk,
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.280]  and now everything is an SSD,
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.080]  and then now you've freed up some RAM
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.440]  to use for something else,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.600]  and then if you need that thing that was written to disk,
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.880]  you write something else to the storage
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.200]  and unfreeze the part from storage,
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.480]  put it back into RAM,
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.080]  and if it all happens fast enough,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.400]  you don't really notice or complain about it,
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.360]  and the M1 famously has extremely fast IO,
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.040]  very fast SSD storage,
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.240]  and so something like Swap,
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.880]  which used to be dreadfully slow,
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.440]  but better than not having virtual memory,
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.680]  is so fast that you don't even notice it happening,
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.160]  but it's only on the M1 where the iPad can do it,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.760]  which, you know, huh, where to start?
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.680]  One of the bits of controversy about this
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.480]  is that one of the devices that qualifies
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.800]  is the 64 gigabyte of storage iPad Air,
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.680]  which just came out,
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.560]  which in a footnote Apple has said
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.640]  doesn't, won't be using Swap,
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.360]  because it only has 64 gigabytes of storage,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.520]  and so presumably Apple doesn't want to use any of it for Swap,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.120]  even, you know, like a tiny little 4 gigabyte area of it,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.360]  or five, no swap,
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.360]  but therefore the explanation that Stage Manager on iPad
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.240]  requires Swap and therefore requires the M1
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.440]  sort of shoots a hole in it,
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:41.520]  because that 64 gig iPad Air does get Stage Manager,
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.440]  and that's led all sorts of people who have older iPads,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.280]  including, and I have great sympathy for them,
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.000]  people who bought an iPad Pro in 2020 with the A12Z,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.920]  you know, who would like to have Stage Manager,
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.480]  and feel like this machine is faster than,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.200]  seems fast enough to do what I'm seeing.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.880]  And those 2020 iPad Pros have more,
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.360]  a more reasonable RAM amount too,
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.520]  which was the other, the other argument is, right,
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.280]  is like you need enough RAM to keep multiple windows,
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.040]  all those windows open at once.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.240]  No matter how fast your Swap system is in the IO system,
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.960]  you can never beat actual RAM, right?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.560]  It's, you know, it's sort of why RAM even exists.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.120]  If that weren't true, everything could be Swap.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.480]  Everything could be Swap.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.280]  You know, RAM, RAM, you can't beat it.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.960]  This seems like this is not going away.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.840]  So do you think that this is,
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.880]  because I also have sympathy for anyone who bought
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.840]  an iPad Pro that they feel like is recent enough
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.480]  that they really kind of expected this feature to be there.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.760]  I have a personal thing,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.280]  I know I've said it in a bunch of places,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.320]  like you should probably never, ever, ever buy hardware
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.440]  speculating that there will later be software
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.040]  that will enable new features on it.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.600]  And this is a little extreme because it took a long time
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.120]  and Apple made no promises.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.000]  But like, I also understand the people who felt like
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.960]  the iPad Pro had been, was so powerful
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.760]  and you really couldn't max out those processors
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.400]  that they were hoping and they were kind of taking a gamble
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.360]  that they would be able to do more in future updates.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.200]  And then here comes this big feature
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.160]  and they're shut out of it.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.880]  And I totally understand the frustration about it.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.520]  It's infuriating, right?
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.800]  It's like, I just bought an iPad Pro
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.760]  and you want me to buy another one?
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.200]  And this is a thousand dollar iPad.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.400]  What am I doing here?
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.600]  I get all of that.
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.160]  I wonder, and I'm curious what you think,
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.640]  if this is one of those cases,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.080]  and these happen from time to time,
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:44.160]  where Apple's disinclination to get into technical details,
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.120]  gory details about why they do what they do
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.520]  has bitten them.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:53.360]  Because like, they could have just said
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.680]  it requires the M1 and walked away.
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.080]  But by opening the door with RAM and swap and as excuses,
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.040]  you allow people to look at the tech specs and say,
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.320]  but what about this one?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:10.080]  And my feeling is that this is probably a very complex story.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.600]  I don't believe that this is,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.840]  Apple just conspires to make you buy a new iPad.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.040]  I don't think it's that.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.400]  I really don't.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.440]  I think they looked at the swap and the RAM.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.040]  They looked at the speed of the memory
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.320]  and the storage on the M1,
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:32.400]  which is appreciably faster than on the A12Z and A12X, right?
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.680]  Like it's appreciably faster.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.600]  The M1 is a better chip.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.840]  Remember when the M1 iPads came out and we said,
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:41.840]  why aren't there features that take advantage of the M1?
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.520]  The answer is, well, here it is.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.360]  But the bad news is if you don't have an M1,
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.560]  you don't get it.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.400]  And I wonder if,
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.640]  what they were doing was trying to balance all these things
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.440]  and saying like, well, we could do this on these models,
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.040]  but not with external display support.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.800]  And we could do it on these models,
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.160]  but we would have to limit it to only three windows at a time.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.680]  And they looked at it and then somebody at Apple said,
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.600]  okay, let's just cut it here.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.760]  Saying it's only M1 is the cleanest explanation.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.560]  And so you end up in a situation where their explanations
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.280]  are sort of simplified and they don't tell the whole story
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.360]  and they contradict their tech specs
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  and they don't want to get into it.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.560]  But now that they've broken the glass a little bit,
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:28.400]  they kind of have to get into it because what they've said
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.160]  is contradicted by the tech specs.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:35.040]  When I think the truth is this was a messy decision
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.560]  and that maybe they decided to omit certain systems
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.760]  because they didn't want to get into the complexity of like,
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.120]  maybe it was about implementation.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.440]  Maybe it was about like, we don't want to have a footnote
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.400]  that says no external display support on these systems
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.560]  and only three windows on these systems.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.880]  We just want to keep it clean and simple.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.760]  And my guess is that that is what they're guilty of,
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.360]  is wanting to keep it clean and simple
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.960]  or just conceiving of it as like, what could we do
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.080]  now that we've got the M1?
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.960]  It's like, oh, we can finally do windowing.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.720]  So let's build it for the M1.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.200]  And either way, they end up in a situation
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.160]  where there are a bunch of people on the outside looking in,
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.920]  which is why you asked me on Twitter,
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.720]  what if they had announced this with the M1?
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.920]  Would people have been as angry?
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.640]  And you think that people would not have been,
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.000]  that they would have reacted differently to it.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.400]  And I thought to myself, I don't know.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.080]  I think those people with the older iPads
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.120]  would still be kind of mad,
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.120]  but I think it would be a different narrative
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.360]  if it was all about like, this is how we can do this feature,
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:37.920]  is the M1.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.360]  The M1 is the answer.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.280]  Even on that little iPad Air,
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.640]  the reason it can do it at all is because it's got an M1.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:48.160]  Yeah, so my spitball idea is last year
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.000]  when they introduced the first M1 iPad Pros,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.600]  which was just two models,
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.000]  if they had announced Stage Manager for iPad
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.840]  at that same time and said,
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.720]  now that we've got the M1 in our highest end Pro iPads,
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.400]  it enables us to do this.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.840]  And we've got, we thought about,
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.320]  how can we take advantage of this amazing desktop quality silicon?
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.760]  How about this?
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.360]  Here's Stage Manager and it's,
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.680]  this wasn't possible before.
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.840]  As great as all of our previous iPads are,
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.280]  this requires the power of the M1.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.600]  And I don't think it would have completely nipped
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.040]  the controversy in the bud,
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.120]  but I think it would have tamped it down significantly.
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:38.240]  If right when it first entered you
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.200]  as an iPad enthusiast's mind,
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.120]  that this is a neat new way
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.800]  of managing multiple windows and applications on iPad,
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.240]  if right from this,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.600]  the very moment it entered your mind,
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.240]  you realized it was only for these brand new M1 iPads,
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:59.280]  I think it would have tamped it down significant.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.400]  The other thing people keep,
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:00.960]  I think you're right.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.160]  People keep mentioning that the A12Z
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.560]  was the chip in the developer kit
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.720]  for Apple Silicon two years ago.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.040]  And so if the A12Z could power Macs two years ago
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.640]  for developers who were developing,
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.080]  porting their Intel-based software
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.840]  to Apple Silicon for the Mac,
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.720]  isn't that proof that it can do swap,
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.280]  that it can do multiple windows, blah, blah, blah.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.520]  So that's, I just tossing that out there
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.960]  as part of the controversy.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.240]  Yeah, I mean, my response would be it's,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.560]  that's Mac OS and this is iPad OS
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.280]  and they're not the same, right?
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.480]  Like, I don't think the proof is like,
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.080]  it's like saying, oh, well,
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:43.360]  that would be an easy feature to fix.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.160]  Like, well, we don't know.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.680]  There may actually be some complexity
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:46.800]  in how they would choose.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.640]  And bottom line is I think they chose not to see
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.200]  or saw it and didn't like it.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.080]  And they're like, now we're just gonna not go that far back.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.840]  But my pushback to you, my response to your tweet was,
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.160]  I think there's an undercurrent in iPad,
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.680]  especially iPad power users,
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.120]  people who buy iPad Pros.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.560]  I think there has been a frustration
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:09.280]  that the hardware has been outpacing the software
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.480]  for a while now.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.240]  And I think there was an expectation
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.920]  that if I bought the high-end iPad,
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.400]  eventually Apple would get there with the software
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.560]  and that I would be able to take advantage of it.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:20.640]  And they finally did it and I can't
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.920]  because they blocked me off.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.000]  And I think we can talk about like,
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.480]  should you feel that way?
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.240]  Or was that a reasonable thing to believe?
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.560]  But I think that's where it's coming from.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.280]  And I think that there is, I get it.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.280]  Like I get the idea that the narrative has been all along,
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.440]  Apple needs to catch up with its software
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.800]  and here they are catching up,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.680]  but it's too bad even though your hardware was so great
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.120]  and Apple just needed to catch up.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:47.920]  Now that they've caught up,
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.600]  your hardware is not good enough anymore.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.400]  I get that.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.320]  And I think that frustration would have existed
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.360]  no matter what the narrative,
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.160]  but I do think you're right that if it had been introduced
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.640]  as an M1 enabled thing,
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.480]  and that was the storytelling,
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.280]  it would be less than it is now.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.480]  Yeah, I think we are in agreement.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.640]  We can argue about how much less,
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.120]  but, and again, it gets back to this,
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.720]  it's been there right since Steve Jobs introduced
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.800]  the first iPad back in 2010.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.440]  And truly one of the great Steve Jobs keynotes
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.880]  of all time, in my opinion,
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.160]  I really think it was great,
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.880]  but just didn't dance around it,
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:33.360]  but actually centered the whole introduction around the,
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.640]  hey, you've got your phone,
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.960]  you've got your laptop,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.680]  is there room in the middle for something new?
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.240]  And saying, yes, we think there is.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:44.080]  We think there is room in the middle,
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.840]  but it has to be better at some things
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.760]  than both other, both devices.
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:50.320]  For some things it has to be both better than a phone
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.280]  and better than just using your laptop.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.080]  And the iPad has lived in that space ever since.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.040]  And to this day,
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.720]  and I think we're seeing it with stage manager,
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.960]  but I think to go back to your point,
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.960]  that iPad users in the last few years,
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.960]  at a point, let's just draw the point
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.760]  where we saw it coming with benchmarks,
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.600]  like just to say geek bench,
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.040]  just because it's so common.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.520]  It was very clear before it happened
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.800]  that Apple Silicon was going to go past Intel
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.960]  in single core performance.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.840]  And that the multi-core performance was limited
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.800]  only by the fact that we were using chips meant for phones,
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.520]  that there was no reason Apple couldn't just add more cores
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:36.720]  if they wanted to create Apple Silicon
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.240]  for let's say the Mac,
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.560]  when that was a hypothetical scenario.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.200]  And I think iPad users rightly have seen these devices
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.960]  hamstrung by the physical constraints of iPhone screens.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.560]  I can give you a date.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.680]  It was October 30th, 2018,
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.680]  where Apple kind of called out,
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.680]  because that's when they announced that new iPad Pro
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.040]  and said, it's faster than most PC laptops.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.640]  That was the moment they laid it down, right?
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.160]  And they said, we're going to be able to beat,
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.640]  our Apple Silicon stuff is faster than PCs.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.520]  It was the moment where we knew
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.680]  that it was coming to the Mac definitively
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.880]  because they're already bragging
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.280]  about how it's faster than PC laptops.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.360]  But also it was them saying,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.120]  the iPad is faster than laptops.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.400]  It's more capable than laptops.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.440]  And I think that's when the narrative really picked up
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.640]  that was like, okay, we agree the hardware is amazing.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.640]  Why is the software so limited?
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.800]  And if you live that for a little while
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.800]  and then they finally unlimited the software
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.320]  and you're like, well, wait a second.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.800]  But I bought this thing in October of 2018
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.720]  and it doesn't do that.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.400]  I would be mad too.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.200]  I get it.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.240]  I mean, nobody likes to have their hardware
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.360]  that they spent money on not get a new feature, right?
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.640]  Like it sucks.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:51.920]  It does.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:52.560]  Absolutely.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:52.880]  Yeah.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.440]  And I just really feel like in large part,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.040]  the hardware clearly was there.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.560]  Apple even said so, like you said,
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.400]  that it's faster than most PC laptops.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.640]  And I know it was one of those statements from Apple
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.920]  that a lot of people who observe the industry at large
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.160]  and not the Apple ecosystem,
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.880]  hyper-focused like me and you do,
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.440]  it were like, ah, more bullshit from Apple.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.360]  And then you start looking at actual tests
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.640]  and use cross-platform apps and to export video
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:21.680]  and do all these things.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.760]  And it's like, oh, wow, they're not kidding.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.800]  But yet at such a basic conceptual level,
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.520]  the actual interface of iPadOS was largely limited
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.680]  by the needs of the iPhone's iOS,
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.040]  which is single window for almost everything
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.160]  because even the biggest iPhone you could buy
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:44.400]  is actually very tiny as a display.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.240]  And it's like, well, wait, my iPad Pro is 13 inches diagonally.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.040]  Why in the world am I limited by an interface
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.640]  that feels so meant for a five and a half inch display?
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.240]  And okay, that's clearly exactly what stage manager
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.320]  for iPad is meant to address, right?
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.040]  Like, okay, your display can hold a couple of things.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.080]  And we can do neat 3D things
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.640]  and have these window groups on the left side.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.960]  We'll tilt them in 3D in perspective to make more room.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.200]  Because if we showed them in complete 2D,
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.240]  it would take up more space.
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.920]  We'll just tilt them backwards.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:22.800]  It'll save space.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.440]  And they're spatially oriented.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.760]  So you can remember that your group with messages and mail
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.640]  is up there at the top and your photos one
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.120]  is down at the bottom and not for you.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:36.720]  And yeah, I will say this.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.600]  And I heard this, I don't think Apple has mentioned it
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.600]  because the other thing that Apple, I think, is hamstrung.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.680]  You mentioned that once they started going
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.440]  into technical details like swap,
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:51.200]  it raises the exception like the one iPad Air
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.840]  with only 64 gigs of storage that doesn't get swapped
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.760]  but still gets stage manager.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.800]  They don't like to say anything negative
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.160]  about other products.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.680]  They'll talk up what's great about the M1,
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.800]  but don't want to publicly say what's not so great
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.120]  about any of the A series chips.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  But since this became a controversy,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.680]  and I don't think this should be a surprise,
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.640]  but the SSD storage on all of the A series chips,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.760]  including the A12Z and A12X that were only used
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:29.040]  on the iPad Pros is not meant for the number
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.240]  of read-write cycles that swap inherently mean.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.720]  When you have an OS that has virtual memory swap,
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.680]  you end up reading and writing to the storage way more often
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.440]  than you do if you don't have swap.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.840]  It's just the nature of it,
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.880]  unless you as a user are using so few apps at a time
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.240]  that you don't actually go past the physical RAM and use it.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.160]  But if you are using swap,
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.480]  it's incredibly intensive on the storage.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.240]  And because all of the A series chips to date were meant
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.040]  for operating systems that didn't have swap,
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:15.440]  they never spec the storage for swap-capable long-term.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.840]  I mean, obviously, it would work.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.480]  If they just flipped a switch and let it work, it would work,
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.440]  but it would wear out the SSDs.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.440]  And going back to those dev kits for Apple Silicon,
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.000]  for the Mac that ran the A12Z,
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.600]  that's one of the reasons why they didn't sell those
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.320]  to developers.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.000]  They were like leased, you'd sign up and put a deposit down
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.120]  and get them there.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.720]  And then they collected them all.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.480]  They weren't meant for long-term use
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.560]  because they didn't have SSD that was meant
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:48.320]  for the long-term wear and tear that a system like macOS
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.520]  has on the storage.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.520]  Yeah, I mean, again,
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.040]  because I know people are really angry about this
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.400]  and I hear from them, I'm totally sympathetic.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.320]  I get why people are mad about this.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:07.200]  My frustration is that it feels sometimes like it's a version
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.680]  of the old, I know I mentioned this earlier,
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:13.200]  the old, come on, this would be an easy feature addition
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:15.200]  to this app that I use and you email the developer
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.960]  and say, it's gotta be easy, probably take you a day.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.400]  And you don't know anything about the complexity of it.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.800]  You flattened it out to something that seems very simple.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.720]  And I think that, right, knowing what we know from the outside
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.320]  and maybe knowing what we might know from talking to people
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:35.280]  on the inside, maybe a little, this is a complex issue.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.640]  And Apple PR doesn't want complexity.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.080]  And so their statements, like I said, have opened the door
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.960]  to a kind of a maze of questions about like,
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.160]  what exactly is going on here?
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.680]  But I think what you say is exactly one of these issues,
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:54.080]  which is like, are we concerned about the rewrite?
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.000]  Are we concerned about the unclear messaging?
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.360]  Are we gonna have to explain how this iPad works,
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.520]  but these iPads don't work?
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.840]  And you can see why they might've just decided like,
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.400]  first off, how many people are gonna use this feature
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.960]  who have the 2020 iPad Pro?
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.160]  Probably not that many.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.720]  And we didn't, how many did we sell?
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.960]  And like, is it worth, how much engineering effort
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.160]  when we need to figure out the windowing system this summer?
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.800]  How many, how much engineering effort should we put
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.160]  into backward compatibility?
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.520]  And you could see why they'd be like, no,
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.920]  let's just say it's the M1 makes this so much easier.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.600]  Let's just focus on the M1.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.920]  But I do wonder now if, because this has become an issue
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.120]  and because Apple sort of like stepped in it a little bit
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.240]  by providing excuses that were not good enough,
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.000]  we're not consistent enough.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.360]  If we might see something that is, you know,
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.240]  okay, the A12Z iPad Pro can run it,
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.160]  but it can't drive an external display
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.560]  and maybe it can only display three windows.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.720]  And like, my question is, will they do that?
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.400]  Maybe, maybe not, I don't know.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.640]  And two, will it make anybody happy about it?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:05.520]  Because in the end, it's all just gradations of unhappiness
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.520]  where you're like, I can't run it.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.000]  I can run it sort of, or I can run it fully.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.160]  And that's the truth of being a computer user
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:15.120]  is eventually you do have to buy a new computer
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.480]  if you want the fancy new thing.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:18.400]  But I can see the argument that maybe,
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.440]  I'm sympathetic to the argument
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.480]  that maybe Apple should have been aware
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.360]  of how grumpy iPad Pro users were
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.120]  and tried to extend it back.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.640]  But I also totally understand why.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:31.280]  They said, and one, it's clean, it's clear,
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.640]  the chip is much better at this.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.480]  It's gonna be a better experience for users.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.640]  And so I'm really curious along with all the fixes
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.160]  that they need to do in the betas,
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.160]  if they will reconsider some sort of like limited support
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.120]  for older systems.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.200]  And that was my spitball idea too,
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.080]  is what if you just said,
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.480]  okay, we'll enable it for more iPads,
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:53.200]  but without any external display support
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.800]  and, or maybe like you said, some kind of limit,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.760]  like only up to three or four windows or apps at a time.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.080]  I would throw in display scaling
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.120]  cause that's the other piece here
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.280]  that they've conflated together that is another issue,
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.720]  which is, do you have the ability
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.560]  to do the display scaling on the internal?
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:11.920]  Because if you can't make the resolution,
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.760]  you change the scaling so that it's all,
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.880]  everything's a little bit fuzzy,
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.320]  but you can get more on the screen.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.640]  If you can't do that, then this feature is not very good.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.720]  Like it's not that great.
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.720]  You need, without an external monitor,
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.360]  you really kind of need the more space feature.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.120]  And so I don't know the details of all the video circuitry
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.840]  that's in those iPad Pros from 2020,
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.200]  but that's the other piece of this.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.680]  So there's like, it's a complex system, right?
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.840]  And like, this is why Apple didn't want to get into it,
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.920]  but then they kind of got into it.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.720]  So now they're in it.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:47.200]  All right, let's take one last break and thank our final
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.960]  sponsor of the episode, our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.440]  Squarespace, you know what they are.

[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.640]  your products, the content you create, even your time.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.680]  You can do it all right on your own website
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.440]  that you make with Squarespace.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.720]  They make it easy for creators.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:16.000]  They even have member areas.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.240]  You can monetize your content and expertise
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.680]  in a way that fits your brand.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.760]  With member areas, you can unlock a new revenue stream
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.240]  for your business and free up time in your schedule
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:29.440]  by selling access to gated content like videos,
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.720]  online courses, or newsletters right from Squarespace.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.400]  You can use their analytics to gain insight
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.600]  and grow your business.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.360]  I love their analytics interface.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.880]  It's so clear, lots and lots of information,
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.280]  but presented in a way that doesn't look like
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:48.080]  a airplane cockpit, but instead looks like it was,
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.960]  it is what it is, which is designed by real designers
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.880]  to give you insight into who's coming to your website
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.160]  from where based on what search terms or keywords
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.320]  and let you know what's popular on your website
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.040]  and what isn't.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.440]  Everything else, stores, you can build them.
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.920]  They do all the commerce, email campaigns.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:09.760]  You can handle that with Squarespace,
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.160]  email campaigns, custom templates
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.600]  that you can customize to your heart's desire
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.560]  or just use right out of the box that look great
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.880]  on every device from an iPhone mini
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.480]  to a Pro Display XDR with 32 inches.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.040]  Everything scales, everything looks great.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.320]  Everything is customizable.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.840]  Just, I can't tell you enough how great Squarespace is.

[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:58.560]  You know, rather than item by item,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.880]  which, you know, I'll link to the upgrade
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.520]  the week after the WWDC where you and Mike
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:04.960]  went through all the details.
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.880]  I think this is good to just spend a lot of time
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.200]  on Stage Manager because I do think it's the,
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.000]  in hindsight, it's sort of like they spent a lot of time
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.920]  up front talking about the new lock screen feature
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:18.000]  for the iPhone, which is cool,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.080]  and I do think is worth the time,
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.920]  but Stage Manager's the one that has like
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.440]  so much more to come, whereas the lock screen thing,
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.400]  yeah, they have, you know, features and bugs to fix
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.040]  and stuff like that, but it is what it is, right?
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.280]  And Stage Manager is sort of a worthy topic
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.200]  of a long podcast discussion.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.280]  I think, I mean, it says a lot about the interface
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.960]  on two of Apple's platforms, right?
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.920]  And interesting ways that they differ,
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.280]  and I think those two things along with the, you know,
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.040]  M2 and the MacBook Air are the most interesting things
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]  to come out of the developer conference,
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.640]  and the M2 is kind of what we thought it was,
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:03.840]  and the MacBook Air is sort of what we were told
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.880]  it would be by the people who are reporting
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.120]  on leaks from sources, but the Stage Manager
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  and the lock screen, I mean, the lock screen is funny
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.760]  because the lock screen is gonna be way more interesting
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:17.840]  when it's on a phone that can keep its screen
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.800]  on all the time, right?
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.760]  Like an Apple Watch, and we all know that that's
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.680]  almost certainly coming in the fall,
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:26.400]  but in the meantime, you know, they've got it
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.080]  in this other version, you know,
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.840]  widgets on the lock screen, it's great, it's smart.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.120]  It's one of those things where it's like,
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.440]  it's an important part of people's iPhone experience,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.960]  and yet it's kind of not been given the attention
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.320]  that it deserves, and so now it has.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.440]  I'm happy about that.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.880]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, the widgets on the lock screen,
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:45.680]  there's been people, I've seen it asked over and over again,
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.800]  why do they look like this?
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.760]  Why do they not have like a sort of card background
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:52.160]  like widgets do on your home screen
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:55.520]  or other places where we've had widgets now?
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:58.720]  And it all makes complete sense and only makes sense
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.760]  when you imagine it in the context of an always on display
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.480]  that just shows the date, time, and these widgets
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.080]  that don't have a card background,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.840]  they're just text on the black screen.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.120]  David Tompa It's literally the only place
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  that Apple has done an always on display before
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:11.520]  Trenton Larkin Right.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:12.800]  David Tompa Is the Apple Watch,
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.040]  and these are complications from the Apple Watch,
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.480]  essentially, and that's why, that's exactly why.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.520]  Trenton Larkin I did want to touch on the M2,
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.960]  because I thought, you know, it's actual hardware
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.200]  coming at WWDC, which is always, you know,
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.440]  it's not unprecedented, but it doesn't happen every year.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.680]  And I think it makes sense scheduling wise.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:37.520]  The M, the new, this is so confusing,
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:44.480]  the MacBook Pro 13 inch with the M2 13 inch is orderable.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.240]  I don't think it's in customer hands yet,
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.440]  but reviews drive this week, including yours.
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.360]  David Tompa Yeah, I think maybe it's shipping
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:54.720]  as of our recording today on the 24th of June.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.000]  I think maybe it's shipping now.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.840]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, yeah, like the orders
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:59.520]  started a week ago, and now today,
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.600]  customers are getting them.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.640]  David Tompa Controversial.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.680]  So they introduced two machines,
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.240]  an all new MacBook Air with a truly all new industrial design,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.960]  and an M2 13 inch MacBook Pro with literally
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.600]  a completely unchanged industrial design.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:20.880]  Could not be more different.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.920]  In fact, they were very clear in my briefings with them
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.600]  after the keynote, I don't know if you had the same briefing
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:30.160]  where it was, I know this is one where we weren't together,
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.040]  but it was the two MacBook Pro or MacBooks next to each other,
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:40.240]  one briefing, and the part they were ready for
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:43.200]  before they opened up to questions was telling us
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  everything that was new and improved in the air,
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.880]  reduced weight, reduced volume, a brighter screen,
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.000]  400 to 500 nits max, better sound system,
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.480]  better microphones, other things that were new,
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.320]  and something about the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.760]  And I just asked just to clarify,
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:08.320]  is there anything different in the M2 13 inch MacBook Pro
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.480]  from the M1 model that looks exactly the same
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.520]  other than going from the M1 to M2?
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.800]  And they were just very clear.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.480]  Nope, that's the only thing that's different.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.000]  Same speakers, same display, same weight, same dimensions,
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.040]  same touch bar, absolutely nothing's changed
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:28.880]  except they tore out the M1, put in an M2, and that's it.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.040]  So it couldn't be easier to explain.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.240]  I mean, that's, it literally is a pure test
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.320]  of the difference between the M1 and M2.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:40.720]  Yeah, I don't know about your briefing.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.080]  On my briefing, it was very much like,
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:45.200]  can I touch the MacBook Air?
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:45.840]  Yeah.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:49.040]  And then the MacBook Pro sitting there is like, whatever,
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.880]  cause it's literally no different.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.080]  I think that's the funny thing about it.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.000]  Certainly there's no world where Apple wanted
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.040]  their first M2 processor based Mac to be that laptop.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:03.440]  It's not interesting at all, but it exists for reasons
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:05.600]  and it's still got a touch bar and it doesn't have MagSafe.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.320]  And I think it's not a computer almost anybody should buy,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.520]  but the M2 is, you know, it's what we thought it was,
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:13.040]  plus a little bit more, I would say, you know,
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.400]  it's got that, it's got a nice per core speed boost
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.760]  and the next generation GPU, next generation core,
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.040]  next generation like secure enclave and neural engine
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:24.160]  and all of that.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.600]  And the part that surprised me was the 4K video encode stuff
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.600]  where like they took the high-end video encoding blocks
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.600]  that they put in the M1 Pro and Max,
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:34.800]  and they just put them in the M2,
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.800]  which is sort of like, what is going to be
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.120]  in the M2 Pro and Max, I wonder.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.560]  But I don't know, also I'm reminded,
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.200]  cause I wrote my review this week of that uninteresting
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200]  laptop and I'm reminded that like,
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.480]  most people don't need much more power.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:53.040]  I like the, most people are coming from Intel, first off.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.920]  Most people are going to buy an M2 laptop are coming
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:59.120]  from Intel and they're going to still get that huge boost.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:02.160]  And the power in there is so much so like it already
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.000]  was killing it at 1080 HD video encodes and stuff.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.800]  It's now it's 4K that it can kill it at too,
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.720]  which is like, is that even a consumer application yet?
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.880]  I guess maybe a little, but kind of not.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.320]  Like this is where Apple is.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.280]  Like it is, it's, I am constantly fascinated by the fact
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.360]  that when Apple does these Apple Silicon announcements
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.840]  that they're like, they're so, they're so confident
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.840]  in their ability to do this.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.480]  And you see those moves be confident in things
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.600]  like taking things right out of the Pro chips
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.840]  on the previous generation and rolling them in
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:36.800]  because that strongly suggests that they're not too worried
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.880]  about what they've got up their sleeve for the next
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.800]  generation of Pro chips as well.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:44.240]  And it's just like, I, it's been a while since I've seen
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:48.480]  Apple quite this confident in this kind of a story,
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:49.280]  this chip story.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.960]  I mean, on the, on the iPhone, it's been like that
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.440]  for a little while, but on the Mac now, it's just a
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.600]  completely different tune than back when they were
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:57.200]  rolling out Intel updates, right?
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.840]  Cause this is our first update in Apple Silicon era.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.440]  And like, it's just like it was all along on the iPhone
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.240]  where they're like, yep, here it is.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.160]  It's, yep, everything is faster.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.120]  Everything is better.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:12.880]  And like, it's, it's just, what a change from like
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.840]  the last round of Intel speed bump announcements.
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:16.960]  Yeah.
[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.920]  What they really didn't have much to speak of, you know,
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:23.120]  and, and, and if there were, if there were, you know,
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.920]  CPU performance gains, they were so meager.
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.000]  It wasn't, you know, it was almost embarrassing to,
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  to say 5% faster, you know, two years after the previous
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.040]  model came out.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:36.720]  And I think in some cases, the Intel lineup got so
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:40.160]  confusing where, where there were superior machines
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.960]  that had worse single core performance.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:44.800]  You know, like, you know, I think you could say that
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.400]  in large, in a lot of ways for a lot of tests with the
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.400]  iMac Pro, which was sort of a weird one-off computer
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:55.600]  for that, that, that sort of patched over a gap in the
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  lineup for a couple of years while they knew internally,
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.200]  they knew they were going to Apple Silicon.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.480]  They weren't going to say that so publicly, but it was
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.120]  sort of like, well, we need something for developers
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.960]  and pro users who, who, you know, machine like this.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:14.720]  But the Xeon chips were like slower in single core,
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.880]  but if you had multi-core needs, it was a great machine
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.440]  overall and had great multi-core performance.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.400]  But it's a weird thing to talk about product marketing
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:24.880]  wise.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.560]  They said something to the effect of like 18% faster CPU,
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:32.400]  but obviously that varies case by case in the real world.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.320]  Now that these machines are out, people are saying it's,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.360]  yeah, about 20%.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.320]  That's a good increase for 18 months.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:44.000]  You know, the first M1 Max came out in November of 2020.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:44.640]  Is that right?
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.140]  Yeah.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:46.240]  Yeah.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:49.440]  So it is keep, keep in mind too that, you know, so many,
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.040]  and I, I do this too, right?
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.920]  Like you do a core single core test of Geekbench or
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.880]  something like that.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.240]  But the truth is when you're talking about overall device
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:00.720]  performance, you're talking about a combination of factors,
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:00.960]  right?
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:02.000]  It's single core.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.920]  If you've got stuff that's single threaded, it's multi-core.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:06.640]  If you've got stuff that's multi-threaded, but it's also the
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.560]  memory and the storage because you may be doing swap or
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:12.560]  you're reading things in or writing things out.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.800]  And, and, and obviously the speed of the memory is going
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:17.680]  to be a limiting factor at some point, all of those things
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.400]  factor in.
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:20.880]  And that's the thing about the M2 is it's not just that the
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.280]  cores are a little bit faster and the GPU cores are a little
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.520]  bit faster, but it is true that the memory bandwidth is
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:27.840]  faster because they're using the same memory as on the M
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:30.960]  again, the M1 Pro and M1 Max and M1 Ultra.
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.400]  They're using that memory, which also enables them to go up
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.960]  to 24 gigs of, of memory as a max up from 16.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.720]  And their SSD is faster, I believe as well.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.600]  So you end up with all of those things kind of contribute
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.560]  to it being faster.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.240]  It's not just about the cores.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:48.480]  Yeah.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:52.320]  I realize that the, the 13 inch Mac book pro with the touch
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:59.840]  bar is it, it is controversial in a way, in so far as people
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.680]  are like, why does this machine even exist?
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.440]  This is it's offensive to people.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.080]  Why are they selling this $1,300 starting point machine when
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.920]  it's, it even has a, because they changed nothing from the
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.000]  one 18 months ago, it, it even has a worse camera than the
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  new MacBook Air 720P instead of 1080P.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.120]  The explanation, I think, I don't, I, nobody would explain
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.200]  this to me in such terms, but there can be a no other
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.400]  explanation.
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.680]  Here's the explanation.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.640]  It sells.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:34.080]  And I think they, the closest they came to an explanation
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.040]  wasn't in briefings.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.120]  It was actually in the keynote where Ternus, I think,
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.600]  described it as their second best-selling Mac, you know,
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.200]  that their best-selling Mac is the MacBook Air most beloved
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.360]  best-selling for all the obvious reasons.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.600]  Their second best-selling Mac is the, the two-port 13-inch
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.360]  MacBook Pro with a touch bar.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.040]  And therefore they're, they, they, if it ain't broke, don't
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:57.440]  fix it.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.200]  And who knows, maybe in a world where COVID didn't happen
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:05.600]  and supply chain was not in a screwed up state that it is,
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:08.720]  and they have to prioritize and obviously the iPhone is
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.720]  going to get the top priority of any platform.
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.840]  But we were in a world now where like, you know, here's
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:16.000]  my, my dedication to the podcast craft.
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.200]  My studio display with nanotexture, which I ordered months
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:24.960]  ago, arrived 50 minutes before you and I started recording
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.000]  this episode.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.040]  So it's still sitting unopened upstairs with my fingers
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:31.440]  itching to, to put it on my desk.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.720]  But that's unusual.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.000]  That is not a, that's a, that's a thing that should not
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.360]  take 10 weeks to arrive, right?
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:44.640]  And people, the MacBook Pros with the, the M1 Pro and Macs
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.240]  are backordered at the moment.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.160]  And it takes, you know, those aren't even new products.
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.080]  They should not be backordered at this time.
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:54.720]  The, they announced the MacBook Air at WWDC on June 7th
[01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:59.520]  and said it's coming later next month, which means sometime
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.160]  in July.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.200]  And I'm thinking it might be like July 30th or 31st or
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.000]  something like that, you know, but they didn't want to, they
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.120]  didn't want to not, not announce it at WWDC.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.000]  They didn't want to hold a separate event just for the
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.920]  MacBook Air in early July.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:16.880]  So they kind of had to pre-announce it, but that's unusual.
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.880]  That's not how Apple usually does things.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:22.720]  And they're usually aren't so uncertain about when they'll
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:24.400]  start taking orders for a product.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.600]  Even if they, the date of an event is not quite caught up
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:33.840]  to where it is in production, mass production, they still
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:36.720]  say we'll start taking orders two Fridays from now or
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:37.920]  something like that.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.280]  Nope, not with the MacBook Air.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.320]  So things are weird.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:43.280]  Maybe if that weren't the case, they would have done that
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:47.040]  would have done a little bit more with this 13-inch MacBook
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.760]  Pro, maybe put a new camera in, done something else with
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.440]  the display, made the speakers better.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:52.000]  Who knows?
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.360]  But maybe not, right?
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:54.880]  Maybe not.
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.360]  I think, yeah, I think it comes down to margins and also
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.960]  there's inflation that you can factor in here too.
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:01.440]  But yeah, cause I think once you start to change it, it
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.760]  unravels and you got to really like actually change it.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.240]  And I think the benefit they have is that it's literally
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:06.720]  unchanged.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:08.240]  It's literally the same enclosure.
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:11.280]  It's literally the same screen, the same camera, all of it.
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.200]  They got a box full of touch bars.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.160]  They got to get those moving.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:16.160]  They got a bunch of extra touch bars, got to stick them
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:16.480]  in there.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:19.360]  And I mean, the truth, like, why does this product exist?
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.800]  Well, first off, yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.040]  There's very, very limited reasons why you would buy it
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.120]  over something like the M2 Air and they're there.
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.120]  There's some, it's got better battery and it's got the
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.800]  touch bar if you like that and all that, but there's so
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.880]  many reasons not to, not to use it.
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.960]  And then the, that the Air is better.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:37.520]  The reason it's the number two, you're right.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.400]  Don't mess with success.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.240]  If it's the number two, we got to keep it going.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.840]  The reason it's the number two, I believe firmly is because
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.600]  some people will only buy a MacBook Pro.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.800]  And when I say some people, I think that it doesn't do
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.360]  it justice.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.560]  Cause I think it's people.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.040]  Yes.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.960]  But I think it's also organizations have standardized
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.000]  on MacBook Pro.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:59.440]  And I was just talking to somebody today, one of my six
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.080]  colors members who says that, you know, he, he asked for
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.240]  an M1 MacBook Air and his IT guy was like, yeah, yeah,
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:04.960]  yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.320]  I got you something better.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.160]  And it was the M1 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.240]  And he's like, that's not what I wanted.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.360]  He was disappointed by it.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:11.680]  Right.
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:13.840]  But, but IT people and companies and they're like, well,
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.680]  no, Matt, we standardized on MacBook Pro.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:16.560]  It's the pro level.
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:17.520]  It's got the pro stuff.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.800]  It's, it's much better for us.
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:20.880]  Cause we're a professional organization here than this
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.400]  consumer laptop, the Air.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:25.280]  And also, so you, so you got to do it.
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.280]  Like if you're Apple, you can't say, well, no, no.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.680]  Or, and what you really can say as well, yes.
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:33.280]  And it starts at two grand now.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.120]  Cause that's what the 14 inch starts at.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:36.400]  That's not going to cut it.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.240]  And so you end up looking at it and you're like, okay, well,
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:39.920]  we can redesign the 13.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.280]  Although you could argue the 14 is the redesigned 13, but let's
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:48.720]  say they make a redesigned 13 and they try to make it with
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:50.000]  MagSafe and all that kind of stuff.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.520]  It's like, well, what is that going to cost them?
[02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.280]  And what are their margins?
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:57.120]  Like, okay, but now you've elevated to a $1,600 product or
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.480]  a $1,700 product.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:01.920]  It's like the reason it sells well is that it it's in the
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.200]  lower price range.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.440]  Plus it's the good, better, best thing where it's like,
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:09.920]  you know, look, it starts at $1,200 or whatever, but in
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.360]  reality, it starts at 2000.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.720]  Cause that other laptop is not one that is, does anything
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:15.920]  like the other ones do.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.960]  It's so in the end, I think that's it is that there are
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.800]  people who must buy a Mac book pro and Apple needs a product
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:27.760]  that hits that price point because they can't say $2,000
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.800]  please in the door for the very cheapest Mac book pro they
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:33.680]  can't do it because they sell so many of them.
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.360]  So that's why it exists.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.640]  And it's, is it a, I was going to say cynical.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:39.280]  I don't think that's it.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:42.880]  But it's like, is it an uninspiring business decision to
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:44.720]  keep that computer the way it is?
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:48.160]  And I think the answer is yeah, it absolutely is an uninspiring
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.680]  business decision, but here we are, it's about margins and
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:55.680]  the buyers wanting a Mac book pro label on it.
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:59.760]  And so here it is, but anybody who knows anything and looks
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.280]  at that in the M2 air, like, I don't think it's an event
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.720]  even hard decision.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.200]  There's almost nobody for whom the 13 inch Mac book pro M2
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:12.160]  is a better computer purchase than the M2 Mac book air.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:16.560]  When it comes out next month, I just, I, it is, they exist,
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.920]  but they are a teeny tiny group of people who probably
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.800]  know who they are.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.800]  And everybody else like shouldn't buy this computer.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.160]  It only exists to hold down the bottom of a price list.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.440]  Computers are it's by definition and it's, what's drawn me
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:34.320]  and you and everybody who might be listening to this show
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.400]  or reading our websites or they're literally logical machines.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.320]  That's what the whole point of them.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.480]  And it's what appeals to so many of our brains that we become
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.920]  enthusiasts who, you know, devote ourselves in our careers
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.480]  to like me and you writing and talking about them or people
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:57.360]  who become computer programmers or engineers or who, you know,
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:00.800]  go and work in it and just want to be around computers.
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.040]  Cause we think they're fun, but it's the fact that they're
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:08.160]  logical and therefore more than any other device, like buying
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.040]  a new coffee maker or, or buying a new washing machine
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:11.840]  or something like that.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.200]  We like to be logical about those things, right?
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.600]  And, and do the consumer reports type thing and go do research
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:24.320]  on washing machines and compare specs and look at checklists
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.720]  and look at these things and make an informed rational decision
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.120]  based on tangible things that you can prove in the real world.
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:35.920]  And by those standards, this machine shouldn't even exist.
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.920]  It really shouldn't, but that's not how so many people buy
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:40.400]  things.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.600]  People buy things that make them feel good and, and that
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.360]  just feel like the right decision.
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:48.400]  And there's a lot of people, and I think you're very true
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.320]  that the 13 inch MacBook Pro is exceedingly popular in
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.960]  corporate IT department purchasing.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:58.880]  I I've heard that from somebody else in the aftermath of this
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:02.720]  machine coming out and people in our sphere saying, I can't,
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.240]  I don't understand who this is for.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.120]  It's it, it, it isn't logically for almost anyone.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.560]  There's like that, that tiny, tiny sliver of people who are
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:17.040]  doing things that require sustained performance at the peak
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.440]  long, long video exports or something like that, or very
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:26.240]  long X code compiles, something where the fan really will
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:26.880]  kick in.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.000]  But famously, not just me and you, but lots and lots of
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.080]  people reviewing these M1 MacBooks over the last 18 months
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:37.680]  have had trouble getting the fans to come on while reviewing
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:39.280]  them just to see what it's like.
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:43.600]  It's, it's actually hard to do when you're trying to do it
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:46.240]  artificially by running benchmarks and stuff.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:50.160]  So the odds that somebody who's a fairly typical user in the
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:54.320]  real world is ever going to engage the fan on a 13 inch M2
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:57.600]  MacBook Pro are very slim, that it'll, it'll ever come on
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.400]  period.
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:01.040]  But I think there's a lot of people who look at them side by
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:04.800]  side and say, this MacBook Air is meant for consumers.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:07.360]  I'm a very serious computer user.
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:08.960]  I really open up a lot of tabs.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.280]  I open up a lot of apps at the same time.
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  I need a thing that's a little thicker and has pro in the
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:16.560]  name.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:19.200]  And oh, one of the technical differences is that this one
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.640]  has a fan or in Apple parlance, an active cooling system.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:23.600]  And this one doesn't.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.320]  Well, I need that because sometimes I've got so many tabs
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:28.560]  open and I use Chrome instead of Safari.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:30.320]  And I know that that's more intense.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.640]  So yeah, I need the one with the fan, you know?
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.240]  And you know, I know that there's people, there's so many
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:43.280]  more people who hate the touch bar than who are publicly in
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:44.960]  love with the tech touch bar.
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.000]  And they did, but it really, one of the reasons it stuck
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.840]  around for so long is they're in the real world.
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:52.640]  There's a lot of people who do like it or at least like it
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:55.120]  when they're looking at it in the store side by side.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:58.160]  Like here's a machine with a bunch of finicky stupid buttons
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:06:59.600]  at the top of the keyboard.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:02.720]  And here's one with this cool color thing where you can slide
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.640]  the volume up and down with your finger.
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:06.720]  And it looks cool, feels cool.
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:08.160]  Some people like it, right?
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.760]  It sells MacBooks.
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.160]  And I know, you know, the people who hate it can't believe
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.720]  there are people who like it, but there are this machine.
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.720]  I bet this machine remains the second best-selling Mac
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:19.360]  in the lineup.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.120]  And I think they did the right thing by not changing anything.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:27.760]  I mean, I would rather there be, nobody's making you buy it,
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:27.920]  right?
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.760]  Your IT manager may make you use it, but nobody's making
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:32.240]  you buy it.
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:35.760]  I think that anybody who it exists to fill a price point,
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:38.160]  it doesn't mean it's taking away from something else.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.200]  Like the MacBook Air is still there.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:42.160]  And in fact, you could argue they're the same computer with,
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:43.520]  you know, these slight differences.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:47.600]  If you price the new MacBook Air at the same specs as the
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:49.280]  MacBook Pro, they cost the same.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:52.400]  They're the same computer, like, except that the MacBook Air
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.320]  has like an extra port because you don't have to charge
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:54.720]  on a port.
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.520]  You can charge on MagSafe and it's got the better webcam
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:01.120]  and it's got the taller screen and it's got a better look
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.960]  and it comes in different shades.
[02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:06.480]  And it's thinner and lighter and it's thinner and lighter
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:08.720]  and nicer in every conceivable way.
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:12.080]  But that's the thing is like, so this product exists for
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.640]  corporate buyers to buy and say they're using a MacBook Pro,
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.880]  even though it's kind of not.
[02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:22.800]  And for everyone else, there's the MacBook Air, right?
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:24.640]  And you're right about the thermals too.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.760]  It's like, yeah, that fan is nice, but we've yet to see it
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:30.960]  takes so much to get the fan to spin up at all on the M1.
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:33.360]  And I imagine the M2, you know, we're going to have that
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:36.480]  similar situation where it's, you know, try to get the
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.680]  MacBook Air to throttle.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:38.480]  Just try.
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:40.800]  It's really, really hard to do.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.720]  And once you're at that point, you got bigger problems.
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:46.160]  Like I said, you know who you are.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.680]  And if you have to have a 13-inch laptop and you can't
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:53.520]  afford the 14-inch and you know this is going to happen,
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:54.880]  well, then this is the computer for you.
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:57.600]  But we are so far on the edge of the edge case at that point
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:01.520]  that, yeah, everybody else knows what the deal is.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:05.840]  It's like the millions of US vehicle buyers who buy a pickup
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:09.360]  truck because they want a pickup truck who never once in
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:12.160]  their entire ownership of the pickup truck put anything in
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.880]  the bed of the pickup truck that wouldn't fit in a much
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.200]  smaller vehicle with sufficiently large trunk-slash-storage
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:25.120]  space, you know, as you get into those hybrid sort of half
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:26.960]  car or half SUV-type vehicles.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.920]  Yeah, crossovers around any van or whatever it is.
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:30.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:31.280]  Right.
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:33.040]  But they know they want a pickup truck, and that's why
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.280]  pickup trucks are such unbelievably high sellers.
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:40.800]  You know, I mean, it's like practically all that Ford
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.800]  sells it these days, you know, is pickup trucks.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:42.880]  Yeah.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:45.280]  And if you're a business, you don't want to say no, right?
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.120]  Because your job is to take their money.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.440]  So if you're Apple and everybody's like, well, we want
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.960]  to buy a MacBook Pro, but we're not going to buy your $2,000
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:55.600]  one for this corporate drone that we have over here.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.800]  We want the cheap one.
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:00.000]  And you're like, well, I mean, when Apple has tried to
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.280]  manipulate their audience, their customer base into doing
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:07.040]  things they don't want to do, even Apple, you can't do it.
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:08.080]  You can't do it.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.680]  So they tried to kill the MacBook Air.
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.800]  Remember, they kept the $999 non-retina Air around for a
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.920]  long time to hit a price point, by the way, just to hit a
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:18.080]  sub-thousand laptop price point.
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:21.760]  But then they came out with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:25.040]  the, without the, like with a touch bar and the one with
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:26.320]  the escape key.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:29.040]  And then they had the, and then they had the 12-inch MacBook.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.280]  And they're like, Hey, you know, like this one's kind of
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:34.400]  like the Air and this one's kind of like the Air and they're
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:35.920]  but they're more expensive.
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:38.400]  And everybody was like, no, we're just going to buy the
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:41.120]  MacBook Air, even though it's not retina, even though it's
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.160]  old, we're still going to buy it.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.440]  Cause that's what we want to buy.
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:49.200]  We want to buy a $999 laptop, not your $1,200 laptop.
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:52.320]  I think they really learned their lesson there that there's
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:57.200]  only so much, you can kind of push consumers where you want
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.120]  them to go a little bit, but there are times when you can't
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:02.800]  and they, they want what they want.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.720]  And when I look at this 13-inch MacBook Pro, that's what
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:09.680]  I think is like, look, the market has spoken.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.600]  They want a thing called Pro that costs what this costs.
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:18.080]  And Apple is not yet capable of making something nicer.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.920]  At this price point with the margins they want.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.440]  And so this is what we get.
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:25.280]  And you really are getting a great computer.
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.120]  It's it is that's so in my review, that's what I said is
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.720]  this thing is three things.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.600]  It's the first M2 and that's interesting.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:38.320]  It's a relic of the past and that's weird.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:41.280]  And it's also a perfectly fine computer out of context.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:46.640]  If the, if the M2 Air did not exist, it'd be like, yeah,
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:47.200]  it's fine.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:49.280]  But you look at all the other laptops Apple has done and
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.120]  you're like, why is this still what it is?
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:54.480]  And I think we've beaten it to death now, but that's, that's
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.640]  why it is, but it's perfectly, it's not bad.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:00.240]  It's just, you know, Apple's moved on everywhere else to
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.160]  something newer and shinier and better.
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:05.360]  And, and this computer is perfectly serviceable.
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:07.120]  Maybe that's why the IT people want to buy it.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:09.040]  They're like perfectly serviceable.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.160]  That's what we're going for.
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.600]  It's like, okay, fair enough.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.720]  It's also not as fun colored as the, the M2 Air, but the M2
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.680]  Airs are nowhere near as fun colored as a lot of us were
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.480]  hoping they would be.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.320]  Yeah, I was hoping we finally get like a bright colored
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.560]  thing, sort of like, I didn't expect we were going to get
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.480]  six bright colors like the iMac.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:31.920]  Although I was hoping, and I disappointed that it's, you
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.720]  know, it's, it's space gray and silver and midnight and
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:35.280]  starlight.
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:36.400]  The midnight is nice.
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:39.120]  It's it's, it's black, but it's actually very, very, very
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:40.640]  dark blue in most light.
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.200]  It's black.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.600]  I like that.
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:45.280]  I kind of remember the old black Mac book.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.520]  It's kind of fun, but I don't know.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.680]  I still am waiting for Apple to embrace.
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:51.680]  It's so great that they embraced it on the iMac and I'm a
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.400]  little surprised.
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:55.120]  And again, maybe there's some supply chain issues here where
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:58.720]  they were reluctant to have that many skews, but they have
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.320]  four colors of Mac book air.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.600]  They're just not that exciting.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:04.720]  And I would have liked at least one again, nobody's going to
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:06.960]  make you buy it just like with the iMac, the M1 iMac.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.920]  There's a silver one.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.680]  Like nobody's going to make you buy a wacky colored computer,
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.880]  but like, wouldn't it be nice if there was a bright blue
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:19.360]  Mac book air or a bright green Mac book air?
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:22.240]  And maybe there will be someday, but not today.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:27.360]  I do think there's something to the fact that the iMacs, you
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.720]  know, the controversial thing with the M1 iMacs is the white
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:33.040]  bezel around the screen or one of the things.
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:35.360]  Some people are like, I don't know about that.
[02:13:35.360 --> 02:13:39.200]  And, you know, I think having reviewed one and used it for
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:45.760]  two weeks, it was, it doesn't bother me in use the way it
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.200]  bothered me when I first saw it.
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:48.880]  It's like, Ooh, I don't think I'm going to like that.
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.960]  And then once I was in front of it, I stopped noticing.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:53.840]  And I think people, I don't know if they were actual rumors
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:57.600]  from people who ostensibly heard this from their sources,
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:00.880]  or if it was all speculation, but, you know, common sense.
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.600]  It wasn't a bad guess that the iMac M1 colors might have
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.000]  been a hint as to the first truly designed around Apple
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.480]  Silicon Mac book air colors.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:13.680]  Turns out not at all.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.840]  But I think though that the iMacs went with the white
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.680]  bezel and the keyboards that look the way they do because
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:26.480]  they, those colors went together and therefore, you know,
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  there were, you know, rumors or speculation that color
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.640]  Mac book airs would have a white bezel around the screen
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:35.920]  and maybe white keyboards instead of black key caps.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:40.560]  And I think that might be true in the abstract if Apple
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.680]  had gone that way.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:46.720]  But the, the, the X factor is the notch where the notch,
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:52.080]  which is on the new M2 Mac book air and not on the completely
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:56.800]  unchanged, except for the chip 13 inch Mac book pro a black
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:01.200]  notch, however distracting you find the notch on the Mac
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.920]  book pros, it's a lot less distracting with a black bezel
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:08.480]  around the screen than it would be to have a white bezel
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:11.120]  around the screen and then have a black notch in the middle
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.240]  of the menu bar.
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.480]  And so I think we're going to go with a knot.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:18.960]  I feel if there's a logic that Apple won't explain, I think
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:21.760]  it starts with the notch and goes backward from there, but
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:24.880]  where we want to use this notch from the Mac book pros.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:27.200]  But if we have the notch, then we need a black bezel.
[02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:30.000]  If we have a black bezel, these colors don't really work.
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:30.800]  Yeah.
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:33.360]  Except so the problem I have with that is that if you look
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  at the Mac book air, it comes in silver and midnight, right?
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.000]  And like that's, that's, that's a not white, but a very, very
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.800]  light color and a very, very dark color.
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.640]  So I don't know.
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.200]  I think that if, if it can pull off silver, maybe it could
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.960]  pull off a bright color as well, especially since the interior
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:58.080]  would be dark, but the exterior would be bright.
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:01.440]  I think when I was doing that 20 max for 2020 series a couple
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:04.560]  of years ago, I, I was struck by the fact that Apple only did
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:08.720]  the colorful laptops for the, the, the iBook very briefly.
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:11.040]  And then they went to the monochrome, they were black and
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:12.880]  white, and then ultimately silver.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:16.640]  And I do think that there's a question, which is your iMac
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:19.840]  is at your house or in your office or in your hotel lobby
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.560]  or wherever it is, you are choosing it as a piece of
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.440]  furniture, almost your laptop comes with you and represents
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:25.680]  you.
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.440]  And I think maybe the argument against a colored laptop is
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:31.840]  people have to carry their laptops with them to job
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.720]  interviews and, you know, and they're at Starbucks and like,
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.640]  you're in public with your computer and maybe people are a
[02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:42.560]  little less reluctant to stand out with a computer in a public
[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:44.480]  place because it says something about them.
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:47.520]  I mean, not everybody, but that's, I keep coming back to
[02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:47.680]  that.
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:49.840]  Cause that was a decision Apple made way back when, and they've
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:52.880]  never gone back on, which is, you know, yeah, the laptop is
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.280]  not really a place for that much personalization.
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.760]  I guess put a sticker on it if you want to, but Apple's not
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:59.440]  gonna, gonna do anything like that.
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.000]  And I wonder if that is one of the arguments is, is people
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.040]  don't actually want to stand out with their laptop.
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.200]  Like they might with their iMac, but I'd love to see it.
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.160]  I would've, I would've taken a bright blue MacBook Air.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.120]  And I think I'm going to buy the midnight one because it's,
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.640]  it is, it does stand out in that way, even though it does
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.120]  look black and you have to look real close to see the blue
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.000]  reflection on it.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.680]  And we'll see how bad it is with fingerprints.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.840]  But you know, I had a black MacBook back in the day and it
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.040]  was terrible with fingerprints.
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:29.920]  It's been a long time since they've had an Apple laptop of
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:31.440]  any name that was this dark.
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.160]  Yeah, it definitely looks cool.
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:37.360]  And it's no surprise to me that it was the one that they featured
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.120]  most prominently, like in the hands-on area, the little kiosk
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.920]  they had right at the entrance where they had, I don't know,
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.080]  a dozen, maybe more open in very, you know, slowly going
[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:51.040]  from open to closed all in a row made for a nice little
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:51.600]  photo.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.840]  But the midnight was the one they showed off.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:57.840]  And again, I don't think it's a crazy theory to think that
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:00.240]  if the supply chain were different, maybe they'd have more
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.400]  colors, you know, just all the ones we already see, which are
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:08.720]  kind of boring, but probably, you know, will sell just great.
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.040]  And maybe one or two or three more IMAX style colors too.
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.840]  But it's like, you know, things are a little nuts right now.
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.920]  Let's keep it down.
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.120]  Anything else that stands out?
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:21.520]  We can't go through item by item, but if you have one more
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:24.000]  thing you wanted to talk about from WWDC, what would it be?
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.280]  Oh, from WWDC.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:27.200]  I don't know.
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.280]  I mean, I feel like we've hit the highest high points of it.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.880]  My other big piece of Apple news from the last little while
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.320]  that I wanted to at least mention is that Apple's continued
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:43.600]  expansion into live sports continues because they announced
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:46.960]  that they signed a 10-year deal with Major League Soccer
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:52.720]  to broadcast every single one Major League Soccer games
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:54.720]  without blackouts.
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:56.560]  And this on the heels of Friday Night Baseball.
[02:18:56.560 --> 02:18:58.880]  I know people love it when we talk about sports here.
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:18:59.920]  We're not talking about keyboards.
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:02.800]  We got to talk about sports, but there's also the rumor that
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:05.600]  they are going to get NFL Sunday tickets starting next year.
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:09.280]  And I think it's, I know we talked about baseball the last
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:11.200]  time I was on about the Friday Night Baseball thing.
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:14.080]  I just want to say again, I think one reason that Apple is
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:20.960]  doing this is to expand the universe of devices that can play
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.560]  Apple TV stuff, that putting sports on Apple's platforms, even
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:30.560]  if it's free like Friday Night Baseball, if you want to watch
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:33.840]  it and you don't have a TV or a streamer box that supports
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:36.960]  Apple TV, it's a motivator to get that.
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.800]  And once you've got it, Apple's gotten in to try and get you
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:45.200]  Apple TV Plus or buy movies or whatever you want to do using
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:46.240]  Apple's platforms.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:47.520]  Apple's gotten in there.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:50.000]  And so I look at this deal, which is fascinating because
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.680]  it's like a little sports league.
[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:54.640]  It's not a big league and so they could buy the whole thing
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:57.440]  and they can say no blackouts and they can experiment with
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.000]  it.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.200]  But I think Apple's trying to figure out what's the best place
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:08.240]  for them to be in live sports and how can they, is it a little
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:10.080]  fractional thing like Major League Baseball?
[02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:14.240]  Is it the whole shebang like MLS or is it something like
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:17.600]  Sunday Ticket where it's a premium on the side thing?
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.320]  And then how does that all work as everything goes to streaming
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:25.440]  because a lot of the sports stuff is the last line of defense
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:26.960]  for traditional cable.
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:31.680]  So it's just like that deal and the fact that in Boston, the
[02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:35.920]  New England Sports Network is going to offer their network
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:39.680]  that does Bruins and Red Sox games over the top as a streaming
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:42.960]  service to anybody, it's starting to feel those two deals
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:44.720]  happening in the same week, I believe.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:47.280]  I had that moment where I thought, oh, I think it's happening.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:50.240]  I think it's going to take a while, but it feels like the
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.280]  move to streaming for sports is like really kicking in now.
[02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.280]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:59.520]  And I do think, I think I brought this up on dithering, but
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:02.480]  it's, you know, far fewer people listen to dithering than
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:02.880]  this show.
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:08.800]  But I do think that there's a, it's one step at a time.
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:11.520]  And if it's in the right direction, then the next step
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:13.920]  follows, the next step follows and don't look for it to come
[02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:14.480]  all at once.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.360]  And I know that when Apple first started getting into original
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:21.120]  content and they had the carpool karaoke, which I think I
[02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:25.840]  called CarPlay Karaoke and the Planet of the Apps show,
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.440]  which really went nowhere.
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:30.640]  And people were like, oh, God, this is making me sick.
[02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:31.520]  What's Apple thinking?
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.080]  These shows stink, you know, or are lame.
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.840]  They're, you know, how are they going to launch a whole
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:39.280]  streaming paid streaming network with this stuff?
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:41.760]  Well, you got to start somewhere and it makes a lot more
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:46.160]  sense to start with a relatively simple show like Carpool
[02:21:46.160 --> 02:21:52.080]  Karaoke than to start with Severance or For All Mankind or
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:56.400]  any of the or the morning show, you know, any of the shows
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:22:01.200]  that are the actual breakthrough hits of Apple TV Plus,
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:05.920]  you know, and I'm slagging on soccer here a little bit by
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:11.760]  saying that MLS is the carpool karaoke of sports.
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:15.120]  But it is the, you know, it's the fifth major sports league
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.760]  of team sports in the US, right?
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:23.440]  It's, you know, the NFL and then the NBA and MLB and then
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:26.880]  the NHL and MLS is below that.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:30.240]  But it is, you know, there's a lot of fans and they do skew
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:32.720]  younger, which goes with streaming, right?
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:36.800]  The average MLS fan is younger than the average, certainly
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:40.000]  the average baseball fan, as you and I know from watching
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.520]  baseball commercials.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.160]  And the structure of this deal is interesting because it's
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:46.720]  structured so every game is going to be on this thing that
[02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:47.760]  they're using.
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:50.000]  As far as I can tell, they're going to use Apple TV channels.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.400]  So it's a separate service that you have to pay for on top
[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:55.360]  of Apple or you don't actually have to have Apple TV Plus.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.040]  You just have to pay for this service.
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:59.840]  But it'll be just like you can do Paramount Plus through
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.120]  Apple TV today if you want to.
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:02.000]  It's going to be like that.
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.560]  It's going to be a thing exclusive to Apple, but it'll
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:08.400]  kind of have its own little service charge that you have to
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:09.040]  do.
[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:11.440]  But they are going to put some games on Apple TV Plus and
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.720]  they're going to put some games on for free, like Major League
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:16.800]  Baseball, like the Friday Night Baseball is right now.
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:21.920]  And I can't read that as anything other than trying to find
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:25.920]  some ways to get people to be able to watch some soccer
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:30.320]  without the buy-in of spending a lot of money because the
[02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:32.880]  problem with it is you're never going to grow your fan base
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:35.520]  if the only way in is through an expensive, essentially,
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.160]  pay-per-view.
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:37.280]  That was the problem.
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:38.160]  It killed boxing.
[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:42.480]  This is a totally esoteric one, but like cricket is a good
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.120]  example where like if you're a sport and soccer, European
[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.600]  soccer before about 10 years ago, it is if it's a tiny group
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:53.280]  of people who want it and they're fervent fans, you charge
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.800]  them a fortune, right?
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:56.960]  And that's great because you make a lot of money, but you
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:00.800]  will never, ever, ever make a new fan in the place where
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:01.760]  that's got that charge.
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:04.800]  So I think Apple is trying to walk the line.
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:07.920]  It actually makes me wonder if Friday Night Baseball might
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.840]  have a free element to it all along.
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:11.920]  MLB TV always has a free game.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:14.080]  One game every day is free.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:18.000]  Like they're trying to make it so that you can sample MLS
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.160]  on Apple TV, either as a complete freebie or as an Apple TV
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:25.360]  Plus subscriber, and then hope that they can convert you
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:28.240]  eventually to such a, an excited fan that you'll pay for
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:28.960]  the whole package.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:31.840]  And I think that that's interesting way of, of trying to
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:35.280]  find a way like formula one just made a deal with ESPN for
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:36.160]  their rights.
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:39.040]  And apparently they turned down offers from a bunch of
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.920]  streamers because they really did want to be on linear TV.
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.800]  They wanted to be on in this case, ESPN.
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.320]  And I can see why, right?
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.480]  Like I could see why you might say, well, they got a lot of
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:54.720]  money, but if I'm only ever on Amazon for pay, nobody's ever
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.320]  going to discover our sport.
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:00.400]  So Apple is trying with MLS to do this kind of like in between
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:02.560]  thing where it's like a little bit for free, a little bit for
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.480]  TV Plus, and then the big package.
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.080]  And we'll see how it goes, but you're right.
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:06.880]  It is Apple.
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.000]  It is Apple experimenting.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.400]  They can afford, they couldn't do like, how much would it have
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:12.640]  cost for them to sign up the NFL for something like this?
[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:15.120]  And it's like, that would be many, many, many, many, many
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.080]  billions of dollars.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.280]  And you know, and those rights aren't for sale.
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:22.160]  So this is this is a good experiment for them.
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:26.000]  It hasn't the NFL done a thing like, so with the Thursday
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.280]  night football, which is one game a week, they've sold some
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:33.840]  of those games to Amazon where nationwide only watch them
[02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:34.640]  on streaming.
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:37.200]  But I think they have, they carved out an exception.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.000]  I don't know if that's going to continue, but I think heretofore
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:44.080]  if it's your local team, you can still tune into a local
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:45.920]  linear TV station to get the game.
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:49.840]  So if it's like Green Bay versus the Philadelphia Eagles
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:52.400]  across the nation, if you want to watch it, you have to go
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.480]  to Amazon Prime, which means you're streaming it.
[02:25:54.480 --> 02:25:58.960]  But if you live in Wisconsin or Southeastern Philadelphia
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:02.480]  or New Jersey, you could tune into some station on actual
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:03.520]  TV to see the game.
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:06.000]  I don't think that's going to continue, but it was sort of
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:09.280]  the NFL saying, I think that I think that is continuing.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:12.720]  I think that the NFL's deal is that it'll always be on over
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:16.240]  the over the air in the local markets of the two teams,
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:18.080]  at least everywhere else starting.
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:20.480]  And it used to be like a rebroadcast of the NFL network,
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.840]  but starting this fall, it's an exclusive to Amazon.
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:27.120]  So yeah, if it is, if it's the Chiefs versus the Vikings,
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:30.800]  it'll be on the air in Minnesota and in Kansas City, but
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:32.960]  not anywhere else, it'll only be on Amazon.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.840]  And they, they went out and they, they, they got Al Michaels
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:38.560]  and I mean, like, like they, they spent money on announcers
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.520]  and they did the whole thing.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.880]  And, and so that's, that's the NFL experimenting with what
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:45.760]  if we did a pure streaming thing, but even then they're
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:48.160]  keeping the local option open.
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:50.640]  The MLS version of that is that the MLS will probably still
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:57.520]  sell some of these games to ESPN or Fox Sports 1 or both,
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.640]  but they won't be exclusive.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.480]  They'll also be on the Apple streaming deal.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.440]  That's just, it will be, you can't black it out.
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:06.080]  The Apple's got the upper hand there, which is also
[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:06.800]  kind of interesting.
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:11.040]  So everybody's trying to figure it out and I'm, I'm, I think
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:11.760]  it's going to be fascinating.
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:13.840]  I think it's going to be one of the most interesting things
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.240]  in terms of technology change in the next five years is like
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:20.480]  the money, cause it's all about money in the end, right?
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.040]  And the money was all about keeping people on cable.
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:26.240]  And now the money is shifting to, Oh no, people are leaving
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:28.480]  cable, but we want their money.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:29.920]  How do we get their money too?
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.240]  And like, they will find a way cause they want their money.
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:32.800]  Yep.
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.840]  And I think the other, the other factor for Apple, and I
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.440]  thought this was very clear, but you had to sort of read
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:42.880]  the subtext of their promotion of Friday night baseball
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:45.680]  when it was new at the beginning of the season.
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:48.320]  And I remember going into an Apple store to see something.
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:51.120]  I think I was trying to look at the, try to see the studio
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:53.920]  display with nano texture or the adjustable base or
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.320]  something, but all of the machines, you know, they have
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:59.680]  them configured so that the Macs that aren't being used
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:02.640]  show a promo that's coordinated and they show the same thing.
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.720]  And it was all for Friday night baseball.
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.880]  And I thought the message was very clear.
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:11.120]  It was, Hey, you somebody who likes baseball, but has never
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:13.040]  watched Apple TV at all.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:14.480]  You just haven't gotten in yet.
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:16.800]  Here's another, you know, you haven't gotten in because of
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.360]  movies and you haven't gotten in because of shows like
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.280]  severance and the morning show, maybe you're a sports fan.
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:25.520]  Try it for baseball, watch a baseball it's free.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:26.640]  Just watch Friday night.
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.920]  Just, just go to Apple TV on any of the device.
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:33.120]  If you own anything in this store, but if you own one of
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:37.200]  them, you can just go to that device for free and watch a
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:37.840]  baseball game.
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:39.440]  That was more or less the gist.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.520]  And I think that that, I, I, I think that so easily overlooked
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:47.600]  in our crowd where we watch streaming more than we watch
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:51.120]  anything else is that there's still lots of people who, you
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:53.520]  know, they've either never watched streaming or that it's
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:54.720]  just Netflix to them.
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:55.120]  Right.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:56.560]  It's there there's TV.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.920]  And then sometimes they watch stuff on Netflix and the idea
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:04.720]  that you, you could do what most of us do, which is, you know,
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:07.440]  zip around between streaming services, sign up for a
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:10.880]  streaming service to get a, just one show and then unsubscribe
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:13.360]  when it's over and wait for something else from them and
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.280]  sort of flip-flop and manage around.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:17.280]  It's nothing like the cable world, right?
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.640]  It's a very different world.
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:20.080]  Just try it, just try it.
[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:24.480]  And if baseball or soccer is what gets you to just try it, next
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:27.200]  thing you know, you are watching severance or something
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:27.680]  like that.
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.160]  Yep.
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:29.120]  Yep.
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:33.040]  As soon as it's part of your possible world, then Apple can
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:34.720]  try to close the deal, right?
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:38.160]  Like if they can, if they can, and, and, and they're thinking
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:39.200]  big picture here, right?
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.760]  They're, they're the, what Julia Alexander, who I do a podcast
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:45.600]  with about streaming, she calls them the ecosystem plays at
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:46.400]  Amazon and Apple.
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:48.560]  Like they don't follow business rules, right?
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:51.120]  Like they're, they're in it for the big picture, the big, big,
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:53.280]  big long-term picture.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.960]  They're happy to spend money in order to get people in their
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:57.840]  ecosystem.
[02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:00.240]  And it's hard not to see some of these sports moves by Apple
[02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:03.040]  as exactly that, which is like, look, we just want people to
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:06.080]  have devices at home that are attached to a TV that are
[02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:07.600]  capable of showing our stuff.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.000]  And then we'll close the deal by making a show they have to
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:10.320]  see.
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:12.720]  And they'll be like, Oh, I do already have Apple.
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:13.680]  Don't I?
[02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:14.960]  Because I watched that baseball game.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.200]  I watched that Mets game that was on Friday night and I had
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.320]  to watch it on Apple.
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:22.800]  So I got the, I got the $25 stick at Walmart, the Roku, and
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:24.320]  it's got the Apple thing on it.
[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:27.120]  And I watched it, but now there's this view.
[02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:29.680]  Or I figured out how to actually get to the Apple thing
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:32.800]  that's actually been on my Samsung TV all along.
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:33.520]  Already on my TV.
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:34.000]  Exactly.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.240]  But I already did it is right.
[02:30:36.240 --> 02:30:36.480]  Yeah.
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:40.240]  And then somebody, they, then they're the next Ted Lasso,
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:42.480]  you know, whatever is the next kind of buzz thing from Apple
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:42.800]  happens.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.720]  And you're like, Oh, I do have that.
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:45.440]  Don't I?
[02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:48.240]  And you've expanded the universe and, you know, Apple can
[02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:51.920]  afford to, to do that kind of big picture thing of like, we
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:54.000]  get them in a little bit and then they got an iPhone and
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:54.720]  they've already got this.
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:56.800]  And then we're like, Oh, there's a bundle.
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.880]  You can do some fitness, you could get an Apple watch.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:00.640]  And it's like, it's all part of that.
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:03.520]  Just like how many different kind of wedges can we stick in
[02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:06.400]  there to like, get in the, get our foot in the door.
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:08.480]  And this is one of them.
[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:10.960]  And sure, I think there's money to be made in the long run,
[02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:14.480]  but there's also like directly from this, but I think it's
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:17.360]  also about that ecosystem and about just getting people.
[02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:20.720]  Apple in many ways it's streaming is kind of like how they
[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:22.000]  were before the iPod, right?
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.160]  Where it's sort of like, people know about it, but like,
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:26.640]  it's kind of esoteric and it's like, yeah, they're Mac users
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:27.280]  and whatever.
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:30.240]  And the iPod kind of turned people's heads and made people
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:30.640]  notice.
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:33.440]  And it's like, well, we think of Apple as being so big and
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:38.000]  dominant and in so many ways, but in streaming, they are an
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:38.640]  afterthought.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:41.040]  Like they are still an afterthought, even with all their
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:44.240]  success and the best picture win and the, all the Ted Lasso
[02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:45.280]  Emmys and all of that.
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:48.640]  They're still sort of like, you're right, Netflix and rest
[02:31:48.640 --> 02:31:50.960]  of world, whatever that is.
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:54.160]  And so any opportunity Apple can have to like, wave at
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:56.000]  somebody and say, no, no, no, you can watch our stuff too.
[02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.080]  At this point is a win for them.
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:58.400]  Yep.
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.480]  I, I agree completely.
[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:03.280]  And it is very exciting looking forward that it, to me, as
[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:05.520]  somebody who's not really a soccer fan, certainly not an
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:08.080]  MLS fan, I'm very excited about the announcement because
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:09.760]  of what it augers going forward.
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:11.200]  Yeah.
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:11.520]  Yeah.
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:13.360]  I mean, that's NFL Sunday ticket deal.
[02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:15.760]  If they make that, that there's going to be something to see.
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:18.960]  I hope that that is the rumors are that they actually have
[02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:20.960]  made it and they're just not announcing it, which kind of
[02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:22.720]  makes sense because it's not going to happen until fall of
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:23.360]  23.
[02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:27.120]  But like in, for, for our new year, we're going to have
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:29.680]  to, and for, for our non-American listeners, you got
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:33.120]  to understand, I know that nobody else cares about the NFL,
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:35.600]  but the NFL is the most successful entertainment product
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:36.560]  in the United States.
[02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:40.080]  It's an NFL game during the season is the number one TV
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:41.760]  show every week.
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.200]  It's a big deal.
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:47.120]  And so, and they have an agreement with all the networks
[02:32:47.120 --> 02:32:48.720]  and Amazon at this point.
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:51.760]  So if Apple joins that as one of the NFL partners, it's a,
[02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:53.680]  it's a big deal.
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:57.120]  And that would be something that would drive a lot of people
[02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:00.080]  toward Apple services for the first time, just to get that
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:00.880]  product.
[02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:01.280]  Yep.
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:01.840]  Absolutely.
[02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:04.400]  Jason, always a pleasure to have you on the show.
[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:07.680]  And again, I'll just end the show the same way I began it,
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:10.400]  which is it's so good to hear your voice, but even better
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:13.520]  that I, I heard it for real, not electronically amplified,
[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:17.280]  just direct and shaking hands, giving hugs.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.720]  I know, right.
[02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:21.760]  It was good in a, in an interesting building we were in,
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:24.400]  but yes, it was, it was fantastic to, to see you.
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.960]  And I'm, I'm hoping that we'll, I'm hoping I'll see you
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:28.880]  again this fall.
[02:33:28.880 --> 02:33:29.120]  Yeah.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.200]  Fingers crossed.
[02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:31.680]  All right.
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:34.480]  And of course, everybody can read your fine work at six
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:37.520]  colors spelled, however you would prefer to spell colors.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:39.040]  Yeah.
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.240]  So you can put a U in or not.
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:41.040]  It doesn't matter.
[02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:42.320]  Six colors.com.
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.720]  And of course, J Snell on Twitter.
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:47.440]  And I think you do a couple of podcasts, but they can find
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:47.520]  them.
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:51.600]  I've lost count, but, but the incomparable.com
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.880]  or relay.fm are the places to go for all of my many
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:55.440]  podcasts.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:55.760]  Anyway.
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:56.640]  Good to hear from you.
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:26.560]  Thanks for having me.
