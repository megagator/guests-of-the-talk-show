[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  And did you, did you actually need the eye patch or was that just for,
[00:03.040 --> 00:08.080]  you know, if you wanted to look like Wolf Helm? I needed it not like because it was
[00:09.280 --> 00:14.320]  like a gross hole in my eye that needed to be covered up. Although it was kind of red,
[00:14.320 --> 00:19.040]  but it was never like gross to look at. So it wasn't cosmetic and it wasn't for the cool look.
[00:20.080 --> 00:26.480]  I needed it because the vision out of that eye was so weird that there, I,
[00:26.480 --> 00:33.280]  I, there was no other way that I could see like to read or watch TV because my brain couldn't process.
[00:33.920 --> 00:35.440]  Yeah. Too disruptive.
[00:35.440 --> 00:40.400]  It was way too disruptive. So I used an eye patch for at least a month for stuff like
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.480]  reading and watching TV. And then I started by like not using it for TV.
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.880]  And now I don't use it for anything, but it's weird though. Like if I close my good eye,
[00:50.880 --> 00:56.880]  I can't read my computer at all, but that's partly because of the eye is just not good.
[00:56.880 --> 01:01.760]  But it's also the case that my prescription is no longer valid. So I actually have an
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.280]  appointment. I'm going soon to get a new prescription for the bad eye. But right now,
[01:07.280 --> 01:13.040]  like as we record the show, I'm wearing my glasses and the lens in my glasses is,
[01:13.040 --> 01:23.280]  um, I mean, is this interesting? The lens in my glasses is, um, I don't even know. Is this
[01:23.280 --> 01:28.800]  interesting? It's, it's fascinating. I think, I mean, I, I mean, we can, or we can talk about
[01:28.800 --> 01:37.040]  baseball or our kids long story short, what started the whole saga for me was that last year,
[01:37.040 --> 01:42.320]  the vision of my left eye started getting, um, I thought blurry. And I just thought it meant that
[01:42.320 --> 01:47.360]  I needed a new prescription. And I was also having trouble reading with my left eye, which I
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.000]  attributed to being 41. And I thought, well, I'm, I'm getting presbyopia. I need, you know, reading
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.480]  glasses, but only for my left eye. And I talked to my regular optometrist and the gist was that
[01:58.480 --> 02:04.160]  you really can't go for like bifocals or whatever, you know, you want to call them until both eyes
[02:04.160 --> 02:08.160]  need them, that your brain doesn't really process it right. If one eye doesn't in my right, I still
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.640]  didn't. Um, so he said, really, you know, it's, I know it's a pain, but you know, this is getting
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.160]  older. It's, you'd be better off just reading with, you know, letting your right eye dominate
[02:16.160 --> 02:20.800]  as you read. And so I did. Um, and then for distance viewing, I got a new prescription and
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.040]  it was a lot stronger. And for years and years and years, I mean, like really, I mean, honestly,
[02:25.040 --> 02:29.600]  since I started wearing glasses, my left and right eyes had more or less the same prescription. Like
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.880]  usually my right eye was a little bit better, meaning it didn't need quite as strong a
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.480]  prescription. Um, but for most of my thirties, they were identical. And I, you know, like when
[02:40.480 --> 02:44.160]  I wore contact lenses, I didn't even have to keep track of left and right. I had the exact same lens
[02:44.160 --> 02:49.760]  for both eyes. Um, so then that's the, that's the sweet spot. It was those were the golden years.
[02:50.320 --> 02:54.000]  Yeah. I used to, I had that for a while, but not anymore. Me being able to see,
[02:54.800 --> 03:00.240]  um, so last year my left eye prescription got a lot stronger and my right eye actually even
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.160]  got better. He's, you know, he said that sometimes happens when you get to be 40. So I actually got
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.720]  a new prescription where the lens in my right eye was actually a weaker prescription than what I'd
[03:08.720 --> 03:15.760]  been using, but the left eye got stronger. Um, and then the months went on and I realized, you know,
[03:16.480 --> 03:21.520]  just a few months after having been to him and being kind of pleased with the, you know,
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.560]  corrected vision, um, that by December, my left eye was everything was blurry again,
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.160]  distance was blurry, closeup was blurry. It just wasn't good. Um, and so it just seemed like a
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.240]  mystery and nobody couldn't figure it out. Like even making it, I got a new, stronger prescription
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.440]  and it was really strong, like worry, seemingly strong because it had gotten so much worse since
[03:41.440 --> 03:48.800]  July. Um, and it turns out, uh, I had a cataract, which was really hard to diagnose cause I couldn't
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.920]  really see it. Um, and 41 is super crazy, duper young to have a cataract. So it wasn't even on
[03:55.920 --> 04:02.320]  the list of things that they suspected. Um, but like Indiana Jones, it's not the years, it's the
[04:02.320 --> 04:10.240]  mileage. Exactly. Uh, my right eye has no signs of a cataract, uh, which is also, most people don't
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.800]  get cataracts until they're in their sixties or seventies and like 55 is considered young for
[04:14.800 --> 04:22.160]  cataracts. Um, but the younger you are, when you get a cataract, the faster it worsens, which so
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.440]  being super crazy young 41 to have a cataract, which is why like my vision went from, Hmm,
[04:27.440 --> 04:31.840]  this kind of is a little, maybe I need a new glasses too. Wow. I don't see so good in the
[04:31.840 --> 04:37.520]  course of a year. Um, cataract surgery is routine. It is like going to the dentist supposedly,
[04:37.520 --> 04:43.120]  although it was terrifying to me. Um, and the retina detachment was, wasn't like a botched
[04:43.120 --> 04:47.120]  surgery or something like that. It happened like a week later, but it's like a one in a thousand
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.120]  complication from any sort of eye surgery that once anything goes in, cause the cataract stuff
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.360]  is all at the front of your eyes, stuff at the lens in the very front. And a retina obviously
[04:55.360 --> 04:59.040]  is all the way in the back, but anytime anything gets switched around in there,
[04:59.040 --> 05:02.960]  there's a small chance that a little bit of the fluid can get behind the retina and then it makes
[05:02.960 --> 05:09.040]  it, uh, come off the eye. So I had the stuff that they do with eyes just seems insane to me.
[05:09.040 --> 05:12.000]  Yeah. It's crazy. It seems like to me, you have to be a psychopath to like,
[05:12.720 --> 05:16.720]  I think all surgeons sorta have to be a little bit like a psychopath, like a little bit sort
[05:16.720 --> 05:23.280]  of, I do. I mean it, they have to be a little bit detached from humanity to, to, to, to, to,
[05:23.280 --> 05:28.320]  to have that not be repulsed by the idea of cutting open somebody, even though, you know,
[05:28.320 --> 05:31.600]  you know, you have to have this rigorous logical mind where you know, you're doing good for the
[05:31.600 --> 05:38.320]  person by doing this thing that your instincts tell you is, is not good. Yeah. So anyway, that's,
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.400]  you know, for people who've been wondering how in the world I had the retina detachment, it was,
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.280]  I had cataract surgery, which was in fact successful. Like the lens implant they put
[05:47.280 --> 05:53.040]  in to replace the cloudy cataract lens is in perfect shape. It's just that like one in a
[05:53.040 --> 05:59.600]  thousand or one in 500 or, you know, some really, really 99% small number of, um, people who have
[05:59.600 --> 06:05.280]  cataract surgery then have a retina detachment. And it turns out I was one of them. So anyway,
[06:05.280 --> 06:11.280]  that is also why my glasses for my left eye are so weird because they were really, really strong
[06:11.280 --> 06:17.680]  because at the time we were trying to counteract the cataract. So anyway, I don't, I don't really
[06:17.680 --> 06:22.400]  see so good out of the left eye, but I have been, I have been nearsighted since grade school
[06:22.400 --> 06:28.080]  basically. And then now, now in the last like five years, I've started to lose that too. So,
[06:28.960 --> 06:33.360]  so not only am I going to need, I mean, you know, I was pretty soon probably need to have
[06:33.360 --> 06:36.480]  some sort of, I don't know what I'm going to do. I mean, I don't know if they make bifocal contact
[06:36.480 --> 06:42.640]  lenses. Uh, they do. I think they do. They don't work so good, but they're kind of weird. Yeah.
[06:43.360 --> 06:46.880]  Yeah. So I guess I'll just have reading class. Yeah. And you do weird things. They do weird
[06:46.880 --> 06:50.880]  things where they, they will give you like two different contacts, one for each eye and let one
[06:50.880 --> 06:56.320]  eye be kind of one. I see close on one. I see far and you leave the office and you think, oh,
[06:56.320 --> 06:59.920]  this is never going to work. This is horrible. But if you give it a week, your brain kind of
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.520]  kicks in. But it's like the long story short is that nothing, once you get into this ended,
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.640]  you don't forget the retina detachment, but once you're in that situation where you're doing stuff
[07:08.640 --> 07:15.920]  like that, you just never just see like you used to do. Like, no, even though I've been over,
[07:15.920 --> 07:21.120]  even though I've been nearsighted since, uh, teenage years too, with contacts. To me,
[07:21.120 --> 07:27.120]  contact lenses were magical up until I was 41 years old where I would, I never had any discomfort
[07:27.120 --> 07:32.800]  with them. I always found them to be like, you spend 30 seconds in the morning and 30 seconds
[07:32.800 --> 07:36.880]  at night and all of a sudden your eyes are just perfect and I could see everything close and
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.600]  everything far. And it was like I had 20, 20 vision in both eyes, but they didn't, but
[07:42.640 --> 07:49.280]  they didn't used to be so good until they came up with disposable ones. Before that I had originally
[07:49.280 --> 07:55.360]  had hard contact lenses, which were a goddamn nightmare. And then after that, they, they,
[07:55.360 --> 08:00.080]  you know, they came up with the plastic with soft plastic ones. Uh, but you were supposed to just
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.160]  like, you've got one pair and you were supposed to keep them and you were supposed to do this like
[08:04.160 --> 08:10.880]  crazy, complicated maintenance stuff with it. And they never, it never, they never got completely
[08:10.880 --> 08:16.960]  clean. And I was always getting like eye infections and my eye was, but when I had
[08:16.960 --> 08:21.440]  the hard lenses, I, my one, I was just watering all the time. So I would do that thing where I
[08:21.440 --> 08:24.720]  would just like, I would take one out. And so I would walk around, I would spend most of my day
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.200]  with just one contact lens and see, see really well out of one eye and like crap out of the
[08:29.200 --> 08:33.440]  other one. Yeah. That's probably like you being just ever so slightly older than me
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.200]  because I missed the hard ones. But when I first started wearing them as a teenager,
[08:37.200 --> 08:40.720]  I believe I used to have to wear them for like six months at a time, something like that.
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.920]  And at the end of the cycle, then I should say it was a little, a little bit uncomfortable.
[08:46.480 --> 08:51.600]  Yeah. Uh, but anyway, it's, you know, it, and it's, it, it also, the other thing too about
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.680]  the retina detachment is it seems to be like a serious, it's a sports injury. Like it takes,
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.400]  it literally takes like six months to a year to completely recover. And it's only been,
[09:03.120 --> 09:10.320]  I'm going to say two months for me. Um, and it is getting better. It's, you know,
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.000]  it definitely is improving, but it's like very, very slow and gradual.
[09:14.560 --> 09:18.320]  We should start a pool on what, uh, what's going to happen to you next year because you've had your,
[09:18.320 --> 09:23.600]  you've had your thumb and now your eye. No, it was my, it wasn't my thumb. It was my middle finger.
[09:23.600 --> 09:30.240]  Was your thumb. No, it was my middle finger. What was your middle finger? Yeah. Really?
[09:30.240 --> 09:33.840]  Oh, I thought it was your thumb. Maybe it was just because the bandage was the brace,
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.040]  the brace made it look like it was your thumb. Yeah. Cause like my thumb was sticking up.
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.840]  I thought you were late. Like they had taken your thumbs. Like someone had to
[09:40.560 --> 09:43.600]  try to cut your thumbs off. No, I had a bad winter. I really did.
[09:43.600 --> 09:52.320]  Yeah. So I'll talk to kafasas. We'll see what we'll, we'll get a pool going. Um,
[09:53.520 --> 09:58.480]  I don't know. It's gotta be something, right? Yeah. I, you know, I, I went to a doctor though
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.360]  and I had like a full checkup cause I thought, you know, this is, um, well actually I think
[10:03.360 --> 10:07.280]  I had to, because I think they weren't going to do, there was some kind of surgery I was
[10:07.280 --> 10:11.920]  going to have, or they said they needed it. Um, but I've, you know, like I got my heart
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.280]  checked in everything. So it looks like I'm good in that regard. I was all,
[10:15.280 --> 10:18.480]  I had such a bad run. I was like, ah, I bet I'm going to have a heart attack too.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.280]  Well now you have the watch. That'll keep, uh, keep, keep dragging your heart for you.
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.960]  Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. It's hard for me to explain. People ask about my eye and I know
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.160]  that they mean well, and I don't want to bring everybody down and complain. Um, but it is,
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.240]  it just requires a long explanation. And the problems with my vision are actually very hard
[10:40.240 --> 10:43.280]  to explain too. Cause I've always just assumed that when you have bad vision, everything is
[10:43.280 --> 10:49.680]  either cloudy or not cloudy or blurry or not blurry. Um, and it's not blurriness. It's,
[10:49.680 --> 10:57.040]  it's like, it's so hard to explain that the vision out of my left eye is like distorted is the word,
[10:57.040 --> 11:06.000]  but the way it's distorted is sort of like, um, uh, I do, I need corrective lenses to help focus
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.760]  to get the picture. Right. But like if I take my glasses off, I have no lens on it at all. I can
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.080]  see at a certain close distance because I'm nearsighted. I can see in focus, but the image
[11:16.080 --> 11:21.040]  is distorted in weird ways. Like the best I can, the best analogy I can think of is think of a
[11:21.040 --> 11:30.000]  movie projector that's in focus, but it's projecting onto a stucco wall. Oh yeah. Uh,
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  like a really stuck away stucco wall. So like, you know, circles don't look perfectly round there.
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.200]  They look like hand drawn, like by somebody with like a very sharp pen, like a scratchy pen.
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.360]  There's like a, there's an image editing filter like that. Right. I mean, there's some,
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.000]  there's some like in Photoshop and in pixel meter, there's like some thing where you can do it. Yeah.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.360]  Like almost like stained glass or something. Yeah. Um, you know, and, but it's, you know,
[11:55.360 --> 12:01.440]  it is definitely improving, but it is improving at such a very slow pace that it's, it's hard to
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.800]  tell on a day to day basis. You know, it's like, I imagine that it's sort of like, if you have like,
[12:07.680 --> 12:13.120]  like Adam, uh, as Adam rain, rain, right. The picture of the one guy for the St. Louis, uh,
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.880]  Cardinals Wainwright had a tour, his Achilles tendon in his ankle the other day,
[12:18.880 --> 12:22.880]  which is a terrible injury, terrible, terrible injury. So his Achilles is torn,
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.760]  um, like a full year to recover. I'm sure that, you know, he's probably already had the surgery
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.680]  and it's like, I'm sure like two months from now, he's still going to be 10 months away from being
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.880]  recovered. So, you know, his ankle is still going to feel like shit. And then like a week later,
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.280]  it's going to, it's going to be improved, but it's still going to feel like shit,
[12:41.280 --> 12:43.680]  you know? And I feel like that's what my vision is like at this point.
[12:44.800 --> 12:48.080]  But also though, like if you have an Achilles tendon, you know, he's going to,
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.080]  he's expected to be able to pitch again. Like the, the unfortunate truth. I don't want to
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.520]  bring everybody down, but the unfortunate truth is I'm never really going to see right out of my
[12:55.520 --> 13:04.800]  left eye again. But on the other hand, on the other hand, I am right eye dominant. I do, I,
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.560]  I wasn't going to talk about this, but it's funny because I do, but I do have,
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.640]  ever since I brought it up and made it public at all, I've been inundated with emails and stuff
[13:12.640 --> 13:17.600]  like that from readers and listeners who are all of them very, very genuinely concerned and wishing
[13:17.600 --> 13:26.160]  me the best in the grand scheme of having serious vision issues. I'm incredibly lucky because I'm
[13:26.160 --> 13:34.640]  right eye dominant. And my right eye is still 2020 with corrected vision and shows no sign of
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.560]  cataract. Their best explanation for why I got a cataract so young is probably that I had some
[13:38.560 --> 13:41.920]  kind of injury could have, they said it could have even been like as a teenager, like playing
[13:41.920 --> 13:47.600]  basketball or something some kind of trauma that damaged the tissue around the lens. And it just,
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.920]  you know, takes a long time, but the fact that I was so young means it probably wasn't like age
[13:51.920 --> 13:58.720]  related. And so it's, you know, very unlikely. Even if I do eventually get a cataract in the
[13:58.720 --> 14:05.680]  right eye, you know, I can go to a specialist you know who would be like super duper extra careful
[14:05.680 --> 14:11.280]  with the cataract surgery knowing that I have a, you know, obviously I have some kind of tendency
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.960]  towards the retina issue. And there's no reason to expect that I would, you know, suffer another
[14:16.960 --> 14:24.320]  99.9% chance of success, you know, that I'd be on the wrong side of that again. So, you know,
[14:24.320 --> 14:29.040]  and so being 2020 in the dominant eye, it's funny because that's the other thing too about my vision
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.240]  as I recover from the thing like two months later, my brain is clearly getting way, way better at
[14:34.240 --> 14:44.720]  just sort of ignoring Mr. Left Eye. You know what I mean? Like he's like,
[14:46.880 --> 14:49.840]  you know, it's no longer, he's no longer part of the team.
[14:49.840 --> 14:55.920]  Yeah. It's like, well, no, he is, but it's like, it's okay that he's not so,
[14:55.920 --> 15:01.600]  not really contributing so much, you know. I'll tell you, it was weird. See, that's the thing
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.200]  though. It's like, and it is a sign that I'm getting better. It's this combination of the eye
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.280]  getting better. And again, my surgeon, I was just there like a week and a half ago or two weeks for
[15:11.280 --> 15:17.520]  like an eight week follow-up and he said he was very pleased. And he's been sort of a,
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.480]  he's great. He's, I think, literally like maybe one of the best retina surgeons in the world.
[15:26.800 --> 15:30.880]  So I'm super lucky to have him, but he's also very, very clinical. Like he's, you know,
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.560]  like before I even went into surgery, he was like, because it is like, you know,
[15:34.560 --> 15:41.040]  your vision is never going to be the same again. He's been very, very, he's like set realistic,
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.600]  very under promise over, over delivers sort of doctor all along. And he said,
[15:45.600 --> 15:49.760]  he's very, very pleased with, you know, what I, where I was. Well, that's what you want to do.
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.600]  I mean, you don't want to go in like telling people they'll be, they'll be good as new and,
[15:56.560 --> 16:00.480]  and then they come out and they're not like, if you come out and it's better than you expected,
[16:00.480 --> 16:02.960]  that's great. But if it's worse than that's not so good.
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.560]  But it's been weird. Like I said, it's a relatively slow pace of improvement,
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.000]  but it's still only been eight weeks. And it's been this weird graph of like, what's better,
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.560]  just keeping the eye patch over the left eye and just being one eyed with a 20, 20 eye,
[16:21.280 --> 16:26.800]  or trying to make the best out of this mixed picture. And it's been weird because at first
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.400]  I use using the eye patch for almost everything. I even took it, you know, like when I went to the
[16:30.400 --> 16:35.680]  supermarket and stuff. Cause it was just the vision out of the left eye was just, it was just
[16:35.680 --> 16:39.680]  not, it was, you know, the, the gas bubble made it, you know, just made it completely useless.
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.320]  I mean, it was effectively blind, you know, it's like when you, you fi finally understood what it
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.360]  meant to be where you're not blind, like everything looks black, you're, you see color and stuff like
[16:49.360 --> 16:56.000]  that, but it's completely and utterly useless at any distance. But having that being monocular,
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.720]  only having one eye that you know, everybody knows that you don't have any depth perception with both
[17:00.720 --> 17:08.560]  without both eyes. But like experiencing it all day was crazy. Like I would just bump into things.
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.040]  It was, I had to be like super, it really turned me into like an old man because I had to be like
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.720]  super careful every time I put a glass down on a table, stuff like that. I was constantly spilling
[17:18.720 --> 17:24.240]  stuff. I would go and take like a pitcher of orange juice and try to pour myself orange juice.
[17:24.240 --> 17:28.880]  And I, if I wasn't completely concentrating on it, boom, it's just splashed all over the counter.
[17:28.880 --> 17:34.800]  And I'd be like, Oh, it's crazy. And it's gotten better than like, now I don't, I don't wear the
[17:34.800 --> 17:40.560]  iPad for anything, even though the left eye isn't like helping me read. But even though,
[17:40.560 --> 17:44.240]  even though the vision is bad, your depth perception is okay. Yeah. That's the thing
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.280]  is that having the left eye can troop the left eye is absolute. So it is doing something.
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.680]  Yeah. Yeah. Like, and I can do things like if I throw something up in the air, you know,
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.840]  I can catch it and stuff. I can see, like, I can get that sort of depth perception.
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.560]  So your juggling career is not over.
[18:01.920 --> 18:02.420]  No.
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.280]  Babies and chainsaws back at it.
[18:07.920 --> 18:12.160]  Good thing there's nothing going on in the world of stuff. We usually talk about,
[18:12.160 --> 18:14.800]  I guess this is better than having you on and talk about baseball though. Right?
[18:14.800 --> 18:17.200]  Yeah. Right. Nobody likes hearing us talk about baseball.
[18:17.200 --> 18:20.240]  But anyway, everybody out there has been wishing me good thoughts. Thank you. Thank you so much.
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.280]  I really do appreciate it. I don't mean to be too down about it. You know, it's, it's, you know,
[18:25.280 --> 18:30.400]  it's not a good situation, but it could be so much worse. And I really do still have
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.200]  tremendously good vision out of my dominant eye. So it's all things considered. It's not bad and
[18:35.200 --> 18:40.000]  it is getting better. It's good at this point as of this week. And this is sort of new. This would
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.600]  be the last thing I say about it. It's the effect of my combined both eyes open vision is sort of
[18:47.600 --> 18:57.200]  as though there's like, like vapors in the air. Like maybe like what it would look like,
[18:57.200 --> 19:00.160]  maybe not what it would look like in real life. Cause I guess like, you know, like when you have
[19:00.160 --> 19:06.240]  like a gas oven and you know, it's like what, what it would look like in a cartoon if there was a
[19:06.240 --> 19:12.160]  gas leak, right? Like everything is clear and I can see stuff, but it just looks like if I'm,
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.000]  if I was within like three feet of you, it would just look to me like there were,
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.360]  it looks to me like there's just a little bit of waviness in the air between. Like you,
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.200]  you look normal, but it looks like there's wavy vapors in the air
[19:29.360 --> 19:33.840]  living in the desert. Yeah. Well, on that up note, why don't I thank our first sponsor?
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.200]  Well, let's do fracture are good friends at fracture. You guys know fracture.

[20:43.760 --> 20:49.200]  And it's just a tremendous, tremendous product. It's a really cool thing. And obviously if it's
[20:49.200 --> 20:53.920]  like a gift, it's the most important thing is what the picture is of. But I'm telling you firsthand,
[20:53.920 --> 21:01.440]  I know from having given these to my mom, to Amy's mom, that it's also a talking point where
[21:01.440 --> 21:04.480]  they see it, they thank you, they love the picture. And then they immediately ask,
[21:04.480 --> 21:08.640]  wait, how did you make this? This is amazing. Because even people who aren't geeks or nerds,
[21:08.640 --> 21:11.840]  they look at these things and they're like, you could just tell this is not like a regular
[21:11.840 --> 21:18.560]  printed photo. What fracture does is they print the photos directly on the glass. It's right there.
[21:18.560 --> 21:24.240]  It looks like it's right on the surface of the glass, like a retina screen. There's no frame
[21:24.240 --> 21:31.280]  around it. You can just hang it right on the wall as an edge to edge, no bezel thing that just hangs
[21:31.280 --> 21:37.280]  there. The packaging comes with everything you need to put a thing on the back so you can hang
[21:37.280 --> 21:42.720]  it on the wall to prop it up like an easel if it's something that goes on a mantle or a desk or
[21:42.720 --> 21:48.080]  something like that, depending on the size. It's all there right there in the packaging. The quality
[21:48.080 --> 21:55.040]  is just can't be beat. And it's just a really, really nice thing. So where do you go to find
[21:55.040 --> 22:03.120]  out more? Go to their website. It's fractureme.com fractureme.com and use the code daring fireball,

[22:38.480 --> 22:44.080]  What's open? I got you breakfast. Well, honey, what do you say we start going to church?
[22:44.080 --> 22:51.200]  I got a sin. Good seats too. Right next to God.
[22:55.840 --> 23:02.720]  I even buttered it for you. Don't get up. Oh man. So what's going on this week?
[23:04.640 --> 23:13.040]  Well, I just got my watch yesterday. So that's interesting. I feel like right now the topic
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.160]  is yours isn't really the watch itself, but it's almost like when people are getting them
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.560]  and when they were promised them. Yeah. So mine, mine came well, you know,
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.480]  early, but I mean, my wife ordered it for me because I was at fifth grade camp with my son.
[23:27.600 --> 23:32.640]  So which is a whole other story, but she ordered it for me and she ordered it like,
[23:32.640 --> 23:40.720]  seriously, like four minutes after 12 is when she pushed the button and my date,
[23:40.720 --> 23:49.600]  my initial date range was between May 13th and the 24th. Based on that purchase time,
[23:49.600 --> 23:56.400]  which to me seems ludicrous, but that's, I guess that was what the, the level of availability was,
[23:56.400 --> 24:04.000]  particularly for the, so I got the space gray sport one, which I think was a fairly heavily
[24:04.000 --> 24:12.240]  heavily purchased and it was, um, 42, 42. All right. So we, I clearly, I, again,
[24:12.240 --> 24:17.120]  Apple isn't talking about this and they never will, but it seems very clear by looking at
[24:17.120 --> 24:22.000]  like Twitter and any kind of forum or like Mac rumors or whatever, where people are talking
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.400]  about this, that there's a definite pattern to which watch you ordered, which strap it has,
[24:28.400 --> 24:35.840]  and which ones are being made and shipping out. Um, so we did, we bought three, one for Amy,
[24:35.840 --> 24:40.720]  one for me, one for Jonas. Um, you know, which I, you know, it's, again, it's ridiculous buying
[24:40.720 --> 24:45.600]  your kid in fifth grade, a goddamn Apple watch, but he's a good kid and he, you know, hasn't
[24:45.600 --> 24:50.800]  gotten anything new in a while. And I write it off to, you know, a work expense because
[24:50.800 --> 25:00.320]  I'm fascinated by the fact that he's fascinated by it. Um, so I ordered the, the expensive black
[25:00.320 --> 25:13.360]  link bracelet one, the space black. Okay. Okay. Um, Amy got 38 millimeter Milanese and the one
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.640]  for Jonas is the 38 millimeter space black as far as I can do. And we ordered them boom, boom,
[25:18.640 --> 25:24.720]  boom, boom, right. And for us, it was 3 a.m., but it was right when the store went live and we used
[25:24.720 --> 25:30.560]  the iPhone app. Um, people who are smart, really smart way to, if you really thought that it made
[25:30.560 --> 25:35.760]  a difference to be like at like 30 seconds instead of a minute in the smartest way to do it, which I
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.520]  wasn't smart enough to do was to save a favorite. And you, you were like three, it was like three
[25:41.520 --> 25:48.880]  taps. It was like three taps and a, uh, and uh, what's it called? Touch ID. And you're, you're done
[25:48.880 --> 25:56.000]  for me. It was, you know, it was like four taps. It was like, I want this. Um, so I greedily or
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.600]  ordered my own first. So my, mine was ordered at like one minute in within 45 seconds.
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.160]  Then I ordered Amy's and then I got Jonas's, but all three orders replaced within three minutes.
[26:08.160 --> 26:15.920]  It was like three Oh three and all three orders. Right. And I also got myself a sport built band,
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.360]  the black sport band, 42 millimeters, and Amy wanted a black sport band, 38 millimeters.
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.400]  Um, so I got those two and that I think those orders replaced, you know, I don't know, but
[26:27.040 --> 26:30.400]  within five minutes I was done with all of it, but I ordered those bands separately.
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.680]  The only thing that shipped for us so far is Amy's 38 millimeter Milanese. None of the
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.000]  individual, I thought the bands would just come, you know, cause that seems like the tease, right?
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.160]  You know, yeah, right. You'd get the bands first and then, uh, you didn't get your,
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.960]  and I know that people definitely got the chargers first. People who ordered a second charger
[26:48.960 --> 26:51.440]  definitely got them like days before. Yeah. I saw those on Twitter.
[26:52.560 --> 26:56.000]  Cause that's what torments people. And again, it's easy for me to say that it's tormenting
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.760]  cause I've got the review unit from Apple. So it's not like I'm watchless. Um, but it seems
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.840]  like as a basic rule, the black sport band is somehow in low production across the board,
[27:07.840 --> 27:11.760]  whether you bought standalone bands or whether you bought a watch with a black band.
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.160]  And that's interesting. And I, you know, obviously in yours is black, right? But yours didn't ship
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.160]  yet, right? No, I got it. I mean, I got it yesterday. So it came, it came a lot earlier
[27:22.160 --> 27:27.920]  than they said it was going to come came well at least two weeks earlier. And, but, um, but you
[27:27.920 --> 27:33.360]  know, I didn't, I did not get it. I didn't get until five days after they were supposed to be
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.760]  delivered. Yeah. And I saw somebody else. I saw a couple of people on Twitter who got steel,
[27:37.760 --> 27:42.640]  the steel watch, but with the black band built, you know, like as the built-in configuration
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.880]  who got theirs like yesterday or today. Um, and it seems like they were the exact same boat as you,
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.440]  where they were promised, you know, like May 13th or something like that. And here it is and came,
[27:53.440 --> 27:58.320]  um, but no word on any of our other ones. I think I checked earlier today, but no,
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.800]  none, you know, but it seems as though it isn't even, it's hardly even worth checking because
[28:02.800 --> 28:10.000]  it's like, by the time the status changes on the order, it's like on a truck from FedEx and your
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.440]  doorbell. That's about what happened to me. I think I got, I got an email before I was checking.
[28:15.440 --> 28:20.640]  I was checking fairly regularly, but I got an email, um, before I noticed it on the website,
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.880]  noticed that it changed on the website and it said, and it said it was, it would be here the
[28:24.880 --> 28:35.120]  next day. Yeah. Uh, for Amy's it was, um, cause I've got my Amex on Apple pay and I,
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.960]  I'm not really a notification. We can even talk about like how many notifications you
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.640]  get and for what, you know, and I feel like the watch is really making people think about
[28:42.640 --> 28:51.280]  what notifications they get for what. Um, but one of my favorite features is if you have your Amex
[28:51.280 --> 28:57.600]  in Apple pay on your phone, every time your Amex gets charged, you get a notification telling you
[28:57.600 --> 29:04.160]  who charged it and for how much. And I don't know why, but I really enjoy that. I, you know,
[29:04.160 --> 29:11.680]  and, and 99% of the time it's like 10 seconds after I just charged something. Um, but I,
[29:11.680 --> 29:18.160]  um, but I kind of find it like reassuring, like, uh, I don't know. It's like, I don't know that
[29:18.160 --> 29:27.440]  I've ever been ripped off at a restaurant where I've signed a bill for, you know, $87, um, and
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.080]  been charged more than that, you know, cause you just hand, you know, put a tip down and you hand
[29:32.080 --> 29:36.480]  it and you go like, and I never like go back at the end of the month and look at my bill.
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.720]  And yeah, I used to do that. I don't do that anymore. It became too, if it just became too
[29:40.720 --> 29:45.680]  much to do and I was never finding anything. Right. But I love the fact that like, I'll go
[29:45.680 --> 29:50.480]  outside and you know, maybe we're walking home and then I get a buzz and I look down and it says,
[29:50.480 --> 29:54.560]  you know, that the restaurant just charged me $87 and it's fresh in my head cause I just signed
[29:54.560 --> 30:00.720]  the bill and I know that that's, you know, exactly what it should be. Um, and with Amy's watch,
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.640]  it was like, I got, it was like late at night. It was like, I don't know, like 11 o'clock at night.
[30:04.640 --> 30:09.440]  And it was like, you've been billed $600 and it's like the next morning at like 10 o'clock ding
[30:09.440 --> 30:14.720]  dong. There it is. So I guess I don't really have to check. I guess I'll just get the Amex alert,
[30:14.720 --> 30:20.800]  you know, when, when the next watch ships. But it does seem like it seems like, I mean,
[30:20.800 --> 30:25.680]  I guess there's some people who, who haven't gotten theirs, uh, at the beginning of their
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.560]  promised window. But as far as I can tell, nobody has missed their promised window.
[30:32.720 --> 30:37.520]  Uh, well what about those ones that the developer ones weren't the developer ones?
[30:37.520 --> 30:41.600]  That's a weird, yeah, I thought I, yeah, that was kind of weird to begin with, but I thought I saw
[30:41.600 --> 30:47.360]  some of them say that they had not gotten them despite ordering them. But did they get them
[30:47.360 --> 30:53.680]  yesterday? I don't know. I don't remember who, I don't remember who it was. Whiskas ordered one of
[30:53.680 --> 30:58.560]  those and I couldn't remember what they, what the promise was. The promise was promised delivery by
[30:58.560 --> 31:03.280]  the 28th or promise shipping by the 28th. But Whiskas didn't get his on the 28th, but he did
[31:03.280 --> 31:09.440]  get it on the 29th. Okay. Okay. I don't know if there's anybody, maybe that was the difference,
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.320]  but it's the whole story of those watches seems crazy though, because there's obviously so
[31:14.320 --> 31:18.960]  resource constrained. And after they knew that they, you know, that they were so constrained
[31:18.960 --> 31:25.280]  on these was when they made the offer and it included, like, I think that they, I don't know
[31:25.280 --> 31:30.080]  if they must've, they must've just made a mess of those silver ones with blue straps.
[31:30.080 --> 31:35.680]  Cause that was what, that was all you could get. Right. But for the developer one. Right. And that
[31:35.680 --> 31:41.920]  to me contributes to the idea that, that whatever the reason, whether, you know, it's like
[31:43.680 --> 31:49.680]  factory a is supposed to be making black sport bands. Factory B is making blue ones and green
[31:49.680 --> 31:56.080]  ones and you know, factory a labor problems or an electrical shortage or, you know, maybe like
[31:56.080 --> 31:59.440]  whatever the chemicals are, they mix to make the black. They couldn't get enough of them,
[31:59.440 --> 32:04.480]  but they could get plenty of the ones for blue or white or whatever. But it definitely seemed
[32:04.480 --> 32:09.040]  to me like they, you know, could not make those bands in equal numbers. And the fact that they
[32:09.040 --> 32:15.920]  only offered the, the developer ones in blue. Yeah, exactly. It must seem to be that, you know,
[32:15.920 --> 32:21.520]  they could make as many of the blue ones as they wanted. It also makes me think that it's the band,
[32:21.520 --> 32:27.600]  the bands in particular might be part of the constraints, you know, because it's,
[32:27.600 --> 32:36.880]  there's no matter which sport watch you go to buy, it's like you can't just get one. Right.
[32:36.880 --> 32:41.840]  You just know there's no color combination where you can just go to apple.com and get one sent to
[32:41.840 --> 32:46.560]  you tomorrow. Like everybody says June, if you bought, no matter what you want to buy right now,
[32:46.560 --> 32:53.840]  today, it says June. Well, but, but I'm looking at the, well, at least the black sport band says
[32:53.840 --> 33:00.640]  you can get it in May. Well, it says available to ship in May. Oh, insane. It doesn't say anything
[33:00.640 --> 33:04.480]  more, including the watch or just the sport. No, just the sport band, huh?
[33:06.000 --> 33:10.400]  Yeah, so I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. And Tim Cook mentioned, you know, he said something
[33:10.400 --> 33:17.360]  about like, the fact that they were able to catch up a little bit over the weekend. Yeah,
[33:17.360 --> 33:21.520]  they were able to ship more than they thought that they, you know, they found some under a
[33:21.520 --> 33:28.400]  table or something and we're able to ship some faster than what the date said initially indicated.
[33:29.360 --> 33:34.240]  Yeah. And I, I know that there, and I know that a lot of it is for competitive reasons. And I think
[33:34.240 --> 33:38.400]  part of it is for pride reasons that they just don't want to talk about the problems. I mean,
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.640]  like for example, I mean, remember the, the, the white first white iPhone that like didn't ship
[33:44.640 --> 33:50.480]  for nine months. Oh yeah. Yeah. That was weird. That was like when that was like a manufacturing
[33:50.480 --> 33:56.320]  thing, right? I mean, they clearly, it was like, something was bleeding through, like the camera
[33:56.320 --> 34:03.520]  was affected because light was bleeding through the white plastic. It was like somehow they could
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.800]  make them, obviously they could make them not at scale because they had demo units that people saw
[34:08.800 --> 34:12.000]  and, you know, people knew people who worked at Apple who had them, but for some reason they could
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.680]  not produce the white ones at scale, like the scale they needed to sell them. But that was,
[34:17.680 --> 34:23.680]  it was seriously like nine months. It was like close to being like, cause I know I mentioned
[34:23.680 --> 34:29.520]  this on the show years ago, but Amy ordered that phone and cause she wanted to get a white one and
[34:29.520 --> 34:34.800]  it got to the point where I actually don't even remember if we canceled it or what, what we did,
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.240]  because it got to the point where it was like, even if she got it, it was going to be close.
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.560]  It was clearly going to be close to the next iPhone. I think that's what she did. I think
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.560]  she canceled and just said, you know, I'm actually just going to wait and get the next one because
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.480]  it's ridiculous, you know, to wait nine months. So I think there's all sorts of little problems
[34:52.480 --> 34:57.680]  like that. And at the scale of like the first month, it's to be expected that there's going
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.120]  to be some kind of weird problem. Like we didn't expect it, but the black sport band is really hard
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.440]  to make. They keep coming out really dark gray and it's, you know, that's not acceptable. They're
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.840]  supposed to be black or, you know, they're not bendy enough or something supple enough.
[35:13.840 --> 35:21.840]  They're nice. Did you feel good? And I haven't, I haven't worn, I mean, I I've worn leather bands.
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.120]  Well, actually my last one was nylon, but, um, I've mostly worn leather bands for, you know,
[35:27.120 --> 35:32.960]  forever. So I was kind of, I was slightly concerned about how it would feel, but it's
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.360]  pretty good. That's like maybe like the single most common thing tweeted at me as people open
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.800]  their watches. They're like, wow, you were right. The sport band is really is nice. Or, you know,
[35:46.800 --> 35:50.400]  my favorite version is, wow, I thought you were full of shit when you talked about how nice the
[35:50.400 --> 35:57.440]  sport band is, but you're right. It's, it's really, really great. I heard from people that
[35:57.440 --> 36:00.800]  went to the try-ons too, who said the same thing, or they were like, I really, you know,
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.960]  I could not believe that you were going on and on and on, but sport band in your review.
[36:04.960 --> 36:08.960]  And then I went to the Apple store and I thought it was the nicest feeling of one of them.
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.240]  One of all of them, including, you know, like the super expensive ones.
[36:13.200 --> 36:16.160]  Have you, have you had watches with metal bands before?
[36:16.160 --> 36:20.720]  Yeah. I've been wearing a watch with a metal bracelet for years, a few years.
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.520]  All right. All right. Cause I did that. I did that for a while. Like when I first started wearing
[36:25.520 --> 36:32.080]  like a nice watch, not like a kid's watch. And I just, you know, I found the hair. I found the
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.400]  hair to be a problem. It's not really the hair, the hair snagging to be a problem.
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.040]  Yeah. My risks are not hairless, but they're not like, there's no way I could be.
[36:41.040 --> 36:43.920]  Well, I'm not. Yeah. I'm not, I'm no, I'm no Paul, but
[36:48.400 --> 36:52.640]  I don't know. There must be part of the design. No, it must be like the gross part of being a
[36:53.360 --> 37:00.720]  link bracelet designer. When you go and test the hair, they must have a, they must have like a,
[37:00.720 --> 37:07.600]  a stable of extremely here suit men that they work with to give it a try, come on over and try this.
[37:07.600 --> 37:10.800]  And then they like start measuring how many hairs come out or something like that.
[37:11.520 --> 37:17.120]  Like Paul Neven, Murgon and Adam, Melissa Gore together. And those guys, they should just run
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.840]  their own, run their own watch band business testing, testing, watch bands.
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.600]  All right. So the other thing before we move on, just talking about the watches shipping,
[37:27.600 --> 37:34.560]  the story that broke yesterday, the wall street journal had a report that I think to summarize
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.920]  that Apple has discovered a serious production problem with the Taptic engine and that behind
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.800]  the scenes, they had commissioned two different factories to make them one in China and one in
[37:44.800 --> 37:52.560]  Japan. And that the ones from the company in China had a defect or not, I don't think it was all of
[37:52.560 --> 37:58.320]  them, but that the too many of them, way too many of them had a defect such that it, after some
[37:58.320 --> 38:04.000]  amount of use, it would stop working. And at the ones from Japan don't have this problem, but that
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.120]  means they only have half as many Taptic engines as, or, and they, I guess they didn't say half
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.160]  that's I, you know, cause they didn't say what percentage of the mix. They can only get them,
[38:14.160 --> 38:18.800]  they can only get them from one source reliably. Right. And now that had to shift their plan so
[38:18.800 --> 38:22.800]  that they're going to get all of them from the company in Japan, but it's going to take a while
[38:22.800 --> 38:30.080]  because the, the Japanese maker, you know, wasn't prepared to make that many. And the
[38:30.080 --> 38:37.600]  wall street journal story made it sound as though that's the answer to why the watch is seemingly
[38:37.600 --> 38:45.200]  taking a while to, to, for a supply to meet demand. I, I think they're right about the Taptic
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.920]  engine. They, they say, I mean, it seems pretty clear that they've got a source, at least a source
[38:49.920 --> 38:57.440]  at the Chinese company. And probably the Japanese one too. Like, I don't think that came from Apple.
[38:57.440 --> 39:01.600]  I'm almost certain it did not. Cause I don't think Apple wants anything like that to come out.
[39:05.680 --> 39:10.480]  I think it came from the supply chain, but I don't know that it's the only one I do. Cause
[39:10.480 --> 39:16.240]  I don't understand, you know, for example, why haven't my standalone bands shipped yet? Like,
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.640]  I think there's, you know, that even the bands are taking a while. Like I think I, and I'm guessing,
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.280]  like if you're Jeff Williams or Tim Cook and that you read the story in the journal that says,
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.680]  well, there's one problem. It's the Taptic engine. And it's this one thing like that,
[39:29.680 --> 39:35.200]  that they're just rolling their eyes. Like, Oh God, if only, if only that was the only problem,
[39:35.200 --> 39:43.680]  you know, so you said, you said that you got one that had a bad tactic initially, right.
[39:43.680 --> 39:51.680]  From a review unit, right. The review unit that I got the first day, I thought when at first I
[39:51.680 --> 39:56.800]  tried it on and, you know, just, you know, just a little bit of a briefing with Apple people and,
[39:56.800 --> 40:01.440]  you know, they should, you know, make sure everything's all right. And, and everything
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.400]  was working and it definitely was getting taps. But I remember thinking at first, wow, the taps
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.560]  don't seem strong enough. I'll have to play with the settings on that. Cause that doesn't feel
[40:10.560 --> 40:14.480]  like I remember it feeling that I didn't go to the event March cause of the, I think.
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.400]  But back in September, when I tried one of the things on that was playing the demo loop,
[40:20.400 --> 40:24.880]  which is either identical or very close to the demo loop on the ones in the stores,
[40:24.880 --> 40:30.160]  I remember the taps feeling a lot stronger. But I thought, well, I'll play with the settings.
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.200]  And I played with the settings and it never really seemed strong enough. And I thought,
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.360]  hmm, it's a little disappointing. And then by the nighttime, it seemed to me like, it was like,
[40:37.360 --> 40:41.920]  I don't know that this is working right. I may have to, you know, it's already too late. But
[40:41.920 --> 40:45.840]  in the morning, I'm going to have to look into this. Cause I suspect I really, and it made me
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.240]  think I was crazy. Cause I always, in the back of my head, I always thought that maybe the review
[40:50.240 --> 40:56.240]  units that they give people were like super units that they like, you know, I wouldn't put it past
[40:56.240 --> 41:02.160]  Apple that they would go like when they give you someone like me or, you know, or Pogue or anybody
[41:02.160 --> 41:07.440]  who gets these review units that they like cherry pick, like, you know, they open up the phone and
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.040]  they're like, this is perfect. This is, you know, this is beyond our, you know, measures of quality
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.360]  for what we ship out to everybody. But, you know, this is the best of the best, but apparently,
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.880]  you know, it's not. And I do remember when I got my review unit watch that it was sealed,
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.360]  like the box and everything was all sealed up, which doesn't mean that they didn't reseal it.
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.160]  You know what I mean? But it was definitely sealed, but I think it was just like a watch
[41:32.160 --> 41:38.160]  that came out of the early production runs. And it sounds exactly like what the journal described,
[41:38.160 --> 41:43.040]  where it kind of, it worked. I'm not quite sure. I could be misremembering that it was too weak the
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.480]  first day that may or may not just be me not being used to it or not having the link bracelet tight
[41:48.480 --> 41:52.880]  enough. Cause I eventually I took out one extra link of the link bracelet than what I had the first
[41:52.880 --> 41:56.960]  day. And I think that was part of it. Like it's a lot more comfortable to me. You know, I think it
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.480]  was too loose the first day too, but without question the second day by like 11 o'clock in
[42:02.480 --> 42:09.040]  the morning, it just wasn't tapping at all. And it sounds an awful lot like, um, what they're
[42:09.040 --> 42:14.800]  describing, which is I think hard to test because it seems like the sort of failure where any kind
[42:14.800 --> 42:20.160]  of test you did, that's just like, hook it up, see if it taps, see if, you know, get a notification,
[42:20.160 --> 42:25.040]  see if it taps. Okay. Good to go. Then it's, you know, that's a problem. Like it wasn't like a
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.280]  dead unit. It was a unit that failed very quickly. Yeah. Well, that's interesting to know. I mean,
[42:31.280 --> 42:38.800]  to see if that, because that to me implies like maybe there'll be issues over the longer term,
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.520]  right? Like how are there any that are going to fail after 30 days or 60 days or something
[42:43.520 --> 42:49.360]  like that? Or a year. I mean, you know, six months to a year. Yeah. I heard from at least one reader
[42:49.360 --> 42:56.960]  who I know, um, definitely trust, uh, whose sport Apple sport watch definitely had a dead Taptic
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.840]  unit, took it in the Apple store and the genius was, you know, new, you know, had, hadn't heard
[43:01.840 --> 43:05.440]  it. And he said, like, he emphasized, you know, they were like, wow, that was the first one,
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.800]  you know, the first time they've heard of this problem. Um, uh, but they verified definitely
[43:10.800 --> 43:14.800]  it wasn't tapping and gave him a replacement unit, his replacement unit, which I thought
[43:14.800 --> 43:18.880]  was interesting too. Like how did they do that? It was just the watch. So they took his straps
[43:18.880 --> 43:23.360]  off, just gave him a new watch and put it in, which I think, I mean, who knows what they're
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.640]  going to do once supply isn't so constrained, but that makes a lot of sense to me that each store
[43:28.640 --> 43:32.880]  got delivered a certain number of just playing watches without any straps for anybody who has
[43:32.880 --> 43:38.240]  problems. Um, and you know, like I wrote yesterday, it seems like nobody's blowing this out of control
[43:38.240 --> 43:46.560]  other than the Drudge report, but, uh, I don't think it's true. The line that a couple people
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.920]  put out like Recode and a few others that none of the units left the factory because it seems
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.960]  pretty clear that I got one as a review unit. Um, and somebody else did right. And somebody
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.320]  else did too, but it seems incredibly rare because it does not, it seems to me like the sort of thing
[44:02.320 --> 44:06.240]  where even if like one out of a hundred people had the problem, you know, it would be like the
[44:06.240 --> 44:11.840]  bend gate thing. Yeah. Like I don't think one out of a hundred iPhone six is bent. I think it was
[44:11.840 --> 44:17.120]  way less than that. And you can see that even if it's like a half of 1% or whatever, one in a
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.320]  thousand, how quickly something like that can escalate. Um, so I think it was crazy. I could
[44:22.320 --> 44:28.560]  crazy odd coincidence that I got one as a review unit, except maybe it's not so crazy because the
[44:28.560 --> 44:34.320]  review units went out so much earlier. And so maybe they weren't, they hadn't caught it then.
[44:34.320 --> 44:41.600]  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking. Yeah. Um, you know, but it's interesting. I didn't
[44:41.600 --> 44:45.520]  realize that they would, I mean, I just assume that all this stuff comes from China now.
[44:46.240 --> 44:51.440]  And I was kind of surprised that there's, they're getting a lot of some of these parts from Japan
[44:51.440 --> 44:55.440]  too. Yeah. I did think that was interesting too. Although I guess I'm not surprised though,
[44:55.440 --> 45:00.080]  cause you know, I know that the Japanese still make an awful lot of stuff, you know, that
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.360]  they're, it's, you know, made in Japan is still a big thing for a lot of their consumer electronics.
[45:05.360 --> 45:10.320]  Yeah. Although I guess I, I just didn't, I didn't know how much of that was really that,
[45:10.320 --> 45:16.800]  you know, like, like we do, like, like Apple made in Cupertino, but when it's really made in China.
[45:18.080 --> 45:20.880]  Yeah. I'm assuming, I'm assuming the Japanese stores from China as well.
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.680]  Yeah. I don't know. It's interesting, but I thought particularly for, particularly for
[45:25.680 --> 45:28.080]  components to see, that's the thing I would have think that maybe, okay,
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.840]  maybe they're doing the final assembly in Japan, but they're getting most of their components from
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.080]  Chinese, but yeah, who knows? I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. Taptic engines coming from Japan,
[45:38.080 --> 45:44.480]  at least for now. I don't know. Anything else on the shipping?
[45:46.240 --> 45:52.080]  Uh, no. I mean, it was funny that the UPS guy asked me what color I got.
[45:52.080 --> 45:58.400]  Oh yeah. I always like that when they know they know what's going on. They've got their finger
[45:58.400 --> 46:03.840]  on the pulse of products coming out. You know what? I guess, I guess the other thing I wanted
[46:03.840 --> 46:10.160]  to make on that was with Tim Cook's comments on the analyst call about, you know, the, the demand.
[46:10.160 --> 46:15.600]  I do think I always say this and I think people just don't give them enough credit. They're,
[46:15.600 --> 46:23.840]  they're tight lipped Apple famously, but what they do say is usually very true. Like they don't,
[46:24.480 --> 46:29.200]  you know, it, it, it's worth listening to the words, even if you think it's a little vapid.
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.600]  And I feel like Tim Cook's comments about anytime you make, I mean, this isn't a quote,
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.680]  it's a paraphrase, but anytime you make the first generation of a new product,
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.520]  you expect things like this. Um, and I think things plural is important because I really
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.840]  don't think it's just the taptic engine. I think it's just, I think it's just a nightmare shipping
[46:47.840 --> 46:54.960]  these things the first time. Um, but it really does make you wonder at how good they've gotten
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.880]  at making phones because of how the ridiculous number of iPhone six and six pluses that they
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.680]  shipped right away. Like, um, you know, like immediately on day one, like how many of them
[47:05.680 --> 47:10.400]  went out? Yeah, it spoiled me. I mean, and that's why I was so surprised that when my wife ordered
[47:10.400 --> 47:14.640]  at four minutes past midnight that she, that it still was going to be like a month. Yeah.
[47:14.640 --> 47:17.920]  Seemed like it was going to be a month away. I think that. And I think, I think you're not
[47:17.920 --> 47:23.120]  alone. And I think John mulch, you're a reasonable man and a patient man. And I think some of our,
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.800]  you know, friends out there on the internet are not as reasonable as patient. Um, but I do think
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.640]  that that has fueled the, the, the frustration that people have that they don't have their
[47:34.640 --> 47:42.880]  watch yet. You know, that it's like, I'm sure that there's parts of iPhone six and six plus that,
[47:42.880 --> 47:46.720]  you know, obviously are, you know, the cameras are new and touch ideas improved. It's a new
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.640]  touch ID sensor, um, even compared to the five S, you know, so there's new components, but it's like
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.360]  components, even if they're new, they're the type of thing that they know how to make and they know
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.000]  how to source and they know how to get big quality quantity. Whereas, you know, I mean,
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  who even knows? I mean, like the digital crown, like there's no other dingus in the universe,
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.600]  like the Apple watch digital crown, right? Maybe that thing's hard to make,
[48:10.400 --> 48:16.480]  but it's like nothing. It's like haptics are relatively. Yeah. Well, it's like,
[48:16.480 --> 48:22.400]  unlike anything else. Right. Yeah. So it seems like that would. Yeah. And I think you kind of
[48:22.400 --> 48:26.080]  have to take him at his word that this is really to be expected, you know, and if there's anything
[48:26.080 --> 48:36.640]  that they blew, it was the, the same emphasizing that April 24th date. Right. Right. Because I
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.760]  think a lot of people thought that they would be able to line up if they didn't get one pre-order,
[48:39.760 --> 48:45.120]  they would line up with the store and get one instead. It is possible. It's possible that that
[48:45.120 --> 48:49.360]  was their plan at the time. And maybe this tapping engine thing, I mean, cause the tactic thing
[48:49.360 --> 48:53.360]  really does sound like maybe they, for at least a while, they're only going to be able to make half
[48:53.360 --> 49:00.800]  as many as they expected to. And, you know, and that they just as a rough ballpark, maybe the half
[49:01.600 --> 49:09.040]  that they decided to make all went to the pre-orders and the half that they were maybe
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.320]  going to put in retail stores were the ones like, well, sorry, Angela, you know, we're going to,
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.440]  you know, well, you know what I mean? A lot of people blaming Angela orange for this,
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.240]  which is baffling to me. No it's yeah. Right. It's baffling to me too. I mean,
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.440]  it doesn't make any sense. It's I mean, if you have anybody, you should blame Jeff Williams.
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.400]  Yeah, exactly. I honestly, I hate to say it. I really do. Cause I know there's gotta be
[49:30.400 --> 49:35.440]  somebody out there listens to this show. Who's got the blame Angela angle, but I really do think
[49:35.440 --> 49:40.720]  it's sort of a, uh, like a, uh, misogynist now, uh, misogyny might be the wrong word,
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.640]  but a bias against women. Like I don't, I really do think that there's some,
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.880]  some of the tweets I've seen, like calling for her to be like held responsible. I've seen people
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.840]  seriously, like not like spit coming out of their mouths, raging mad, but like seemingly dead
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.960]  serious who say that she should be fired over this, uh, which is crazy to me. And I really do.
[49:58.960 --> 50:04.400]  I hate to say it because I don't like to, I try not to like knee jerk, see biases like that,
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.160]  but I really don't think they'd be doing that if you know, Ron Johnson was still on the job.
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.400]  Yeah. I, and I don't quite think it's just because she's a woman. I think it's this combination of
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.240]  her being a woman from the fashion world and that the people who were blaming her are, are the
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.320]  people who also think that Apple is making a misstep by stepping away from the, of being a
[50:26.320 --> 50:31.280]  more technological company and more of a fashion company. Well, it's, and it's also just like she's
[50:31.280 --> 50:37.680]  new and it's the first launch, right from her first big product launch that she's involved.
[50:38.400 --> 50:43.120]  Right. But it's like, I don't think that the problem was no, that problem is not,
[50:43.120 --> 50:47.120]  it's not the setup in the stores. It's not the training of the retail employees.
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.120]  She forgot to fill out a form, you know, and then like, you know, Tim Cook, you know,
[50:53.120 --> 50:57.200]  is like, Oh, I guess, Oh, she doesn't want any for the retail stores. I guess she thinks there's no
[50:57.200 --> 51:03.120]  time. And so she knows, I guess she knows what she's doing. She was CEO of Burberry. Yeah. So
[51:03.120 --> 51:07.920]  I guess, you know, I just let that go and then whoopsie, there's no watches in the stores on
[51:07.920 --> 51:14.880]  April 24th. No, I don't know. I can't believe that there are people who blame her. I mean,
[51:14.880 --> 51:18.000]  there are no, there are no watches for them to put in the stores.
[51:18.800 --> 51:24.480]  And they can't even, there can't even fulfill the, the mail, the online orders.
[51:24.480 --> 51:29.040]  Yeah. Right. They can't fulfill the orders and there are no watches for the stores. So I'm not
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.600]  quite sure what exactly she's supposed to be doing. Right. And it's entirely, and I've seen
[51:33.600 --> 51:38.080]  people say, well, then she never, they never should have said April 24, but it's entirely possible
[51:38.080 --> 51:44.240]  that when they said April 24, back on March 9th, that they thought they could do it and that it
[51:44.240 --> 51:49.440]  changed. So, you know, she's not responsible for testing the Taptic Engine. Right.
[51:52.560 --> 51:59.440]  Let me thank our second sponsor and it's our good friends at Casper. You guys know Casper.
[51:59.440 --> 52:06.400]  It's a place where you go and you buy your mattress online, which I know sounds crazy.
[52:09.200 --> 52:13.840]  Hear me out here. Maybe I'm crazy. Could be another good Mother's Day gift.
[52:13.840 --> 52:20.080]  What better way to thank your mom for conceiving you than buying her a new mattress?
[52:20.080 --> 52:31.280]  Or your wife. Or your wife. Yeah. Honey, you're such a great mother. Let's do it again.
[52:31.280 --> 52:36.320]  This is what they make. They make obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices.
[52:36.880 --> 52:42.480]  Just the right sink, just the right bounce. They use two technologies. They don't make you choose
[52:42.480 --> 52:48.000]  from a crazy variety of different mattress types based on descriptions. They made one
[52:48.000 --> 52:54.880]  good mattress technology and it uses two of one good mattress style and it uses two technologies,
[52:54.880 --> 53:01.200]  latex foam and memory foam, and they combine it to give you just the right amount of what one is good
[53:01.200 --> 53:05.280]  for and what the other is good for. They come together and you get better nights, brighter
[53:05.280 --> 53:10.720]  days. You feel great when you wake up because you get a good night's sleep. Here's the thing. I know
[53:10.720 --> 53:15.280]  it sounds so crazy to buy a mattress online because you don't even get to touch it or whatever,
[53:15.280 --> 53:18.480]  you know, let alone, you know, jump on it or whatever you do in the stores.
[53:19.040 --> 53:24.640]  They have a risk free trial and return policy. They give you a hundred days. So you go there,
[53:24.640 --> 53:32.240]  buy the size you want. It shows up at your house in this crazy compressed like vacuum sealed box,
[53:32.240 --> 53:36.720]  which is a big box. It's probably the biggest package that I've gotten delivered to my house
[53:36.720 --> 53:44.320]  in a long time, but crazy small for a mattress. You take it to the room and again, listen to me,
[53:44.320 --> 53:49.920]  you take it to the room where you want it and then you open the box according to their instructions
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.920]  and all of a sudden you have a mattress. Wow.
[53:53.920 --> 53:58.240]  It is crazy. Their mattresses are made in America. They are American made,
[53:59.360 --> 54:03.520]  really, really high quality stuff. And the prices are so much lower than the stuff you see
[54:03.520 --> 54:10.240]  in the mattress retail stores, which is really, really a cartel. You know, if you haven't shopped
[54:10.240 --> 54:13.920]  for a mattress in years, it is so crazy because you go to store A and even if you're looking at
[54:13.920 --> 54:19.200]  the same brand like Sealy or whatever, and you write down prices and you say, well, I think I
[54:19.200 --> 54:22.080]  like that one. You write down the name of the model and then you go to the next store so you
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.720]  can see what the price is. They don't have, there is no model with the same name. Like each store
[54:26.720 --> 54:30.960]  that they sell mattresses to, they give custom names to the mattresses so that you can't,
[54:30.960 --> 54:36.880]  like they specifically, the whole product line of all the major mattresses are made so that you
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.360]  can't price compare. And then there's all these websites, of course, third party websites that
[54:41.360 --> 54:48.720]  help you product compare and they're like the Posturepedic, Flippity B is like the, you know,
[54:48.720 --> 54:54.400]  Rubik's Cube, Dingus C from this store or whatever the names are. I don't know. I'm not really good
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.040]  at naming mattresses, but it makes it impossible. Here's the deal. You go to Casper and it's just
[54:59.040 --> 55:03.840]  simple. One style of mattress, you pick the size and the prices are great. 500 bucks
[55:04.480 --> 55:10.240]  for a twin size mattress, 950 bucks for king size mattress. Now you compare that to the
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.680]  industry prices for a good mattress and it's just outstanding way under. You cannot buy a
[55:15.680 --> 55:24.320]  good king size mattress for under 1000 bucks. Where do you go to find out more www.caspersleep.com

[55:32.800 --> 55:37.760]  save 50 bucks and I will not tell your mom that you use the coupon code to get her her Mother's

[55:43.280 --> 55:50.160]  Day gift. That box is crazy small. It's crazy small. Well, it's big. Yeah. I mean, it's a big
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.560]  box, but it's not, you know, it's not the size of a mattress when we got ours. The funny thing when
[55:54.560 --> 56:02.560]  we got ours, we weren't home and because it was and I wouldn't have ordered it if I was ordering
[56:02.560 --> 56:09.200]  it. We were on vacation over the summer and but it was like they wanted to send one to me because,
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.240]  you know, they wanted me to have one because if I'm gonna be talking about it, you know,
[56:12.240 --> 56:15.760]  a lot more genuine if I've actually I can vouch that the thing is actually a good mattress.
[56:17.920 --> 56:24.000]  So they sent it while we were on vacation and my neighbor signed for it not knowing we were
[56:24.000 --> 56:34.080]  on vacation and he had to hold that box for 10 days. It was like the worst possible timing.
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.480]  It's a big box for it. Yeah, but I got it. We had a pressure washer delivered the other day
[56:38.480 --> 56:44.480]  and it was the box is about the same size. Crazy, which is, you know, it's not a big pressure washer.
[56:44.480 --> 56:52.080]  Yeah. What else is going on? You see this thing where another thing going back to the earnings
[56:52.080 --> 56:59.920]  report where Tim Cook said something about, you know, that he had never seen one of those
[56:59.920 --> 57:05.440]  component breakdowns, you know, where these guys they break open the Apple product and then they
[57:05.440 --> 57:11.120]  itemize everything they see inside and then they tell you that it costs, you know, $67 to make an
[57:11.120 --> 57:17.680]  iPhone and that Apple's profit margins are, you know, 400%. He said he's never seen one that was
[57:17.680 --> 57:23.760]  accurate. And I believe again, yeah, which I wouldn't be again, I take him at his word that
[57:23.760 --> 57:30.880]  they're not. They're not believable. And I quit on daring fireball countdown to I supply saying
[57:30.880 --> 57:39.120]  the Apple Watch costs $67 in 321. And lo and behold, today I supply came out with the thing
[57:39.120 --> 57:45.600]  that said Apple Watch I was off by a little they said it costs $83 to make and that is that is
[57:45.600 --> 57:52.880]  is that what IHS technology is? Is that I think so. I believe that is I supply. So even though
[57:53.440 --> 57:59.680]  on the analyst conference call, which I believe, you know, there are like, like, like the things
[57:59.680 --> 58:07.840]  that Tim Cook and the CFO, what's the new CFO's name? Luca Luca. I always want to say Luca Brasi.
[58:08.560 --> 58:13.360]  No, it's not Luca Brasi. I can't pronounce his name. Well, Luca, I'll just call him on first
[58:13.360 --> 58:20.400]  name. Luca. Sure. You know, I, I'm pretty sure that they are like, literally, like on the hook
[58:20.400 --> 58:25.040]  for the things that they say, like, those are like, you know, like, there's SEC guidelines,
[58:25.040 --> 58:29.840]  you know, regarding what they say. And so usually, they're evasive. And if they say something that's
[58:29.840 --> 58:35.600]  true, it's like, it sort of has to legally be true. And they even said that the margins on
[58:35.600 --> 58:40.640]  Apple Watch, at least next quarter, they're only guiding for the next quarter. And so it could be,
[58:40.640 --> 58:45.360]  you know, this could be steered by first generation initial product runs, they emphasize
[58:45.360 --> 58:51.120]  first connect this coming quarter, the profit margins on Apple Watch will be lower than usual,
[58:51.680 --> 58:55.120]  you know, the rest of the company's and the rest of the product. All right. And that includes all
[58:55.120 --> 58:59.840]  Apple Watches, including, you know, let's, let's just assume the addition is going to sell in this
[58:59.840 --> 59:06.720]  relatively small numbers that we assume, but even you know, like the the 8, 900, $1,000 stainless
[59:06.720 --> 59:12.240]  steel ones, which presumably are going to have higher margins than the 350 and $400 sport models
[59:13.360 --> 59:18.960]  that the margins are going to be lower. Well, I supply says that, no, it's going to be the
[59:18.960 --> 59:25.760]  most profitable, the highest markup of any Apple product $81 $81 and 20 cents, they say,
[59:25.760 --> 59:29.280]  and that the stupid thing is off the top off the face of it. I mean, they admit that it does not
[59:29.280 --> 59:35.280]  include logistics, amortized capital expenses, overhead, SG&A, selling general administration
[59:35.280 --> 59:40.560]  expenses, R&D software, IP licensing and other variables through the supply chain,
[59:41.280 --> 59:47.440]  such as electronics manufacturing services provider. So I mean, our off, you know,
[59:47.440 --> 59:53.200]  it's basically it's the it's like to like those things where, you know, the human body is made
[59:53.200 --> 59:59.440]  up of like $5 of chemicals. It's Yeah, technically, that's true. But you cannot make a human body if
[59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.760]  you go up by $5 a chemical. I've seen some websites over they claim that you can.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.160]  That's not a real human. No, it's not. Oh, but there's also Oh, I see the if you read down the
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:25.120]  story a little bit that $81 and 20 cents, they also add in they say it, the total cost to produce
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:32.160]  the watch is $83 and 70 cents when the $2 50 per unit manufacturing expenses added in.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.960]  So according to them, it costs $2 and 50 cents to manufacture an Apple Watch.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.440]  So the thing they do that, but they do this all the time. I mean, they do this for practice. I
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:48.160]  mean, for many products. Yeah, but it's only I always find them kind of uninteresting.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:55.760]  The I but I can't help but think that with the Apple products in particular,
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:06.480]  they they know that there's like a what's the word a the public has a sense that Apple is
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.440]  ripping us off. And and again, I've you and I think I've talked about this several times
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.440]  that like, they play into it sometimes like when they charge $80 for the USB dongle for the new
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.880]  MacBook, right? Isn't that 80 bucks? Like that play? Because that's actually true. That is not
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.480]  an $80 component like they're that, you know, or and they're they're Ram prices. And like,
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.480]  if you want to upgrade the hard drive on a, you know, on a new MacBook, something like that,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.320]  that's all that all those all that stuff is nowhere near although they've gotten better
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.600]  on those. They've gotten a lot better on the hard drive. They've gotten better. But they've also at
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.320]  the same time, they've locked down the faith like you, you know, you can't do it yourself anymore.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.080]  You know, whereas you used to like, I used to, you know, be able to get an iMac and say,
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.440]  Okay, well, I'm just gonna skimp on the RAM and the hard drive. And you know,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.080]  a couple years from now, I can upgrade the RAM and upgrade the hard drive. No,
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.600]  I can't do that anymore. I've always been a little lazy. And I've never,
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.280]  never liked snapping RAM into place, because it never, ever, ever has felt to me as though I
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.000]  wasn't breaking it. Every time I've ever done it, it's always felt like I'm breaking it. And I don't
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.760]  do it. I never did it enough to really get good at it. You know, like, I know that there's some
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.760]  people who like, like, if you work in it, and you're working at a company, and you set up a
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.760]  lot of new PCs, and you always buy the RAM separate or something like that, well, then
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.240]  you get good at snapping RAM in and out. And you know what it feels like. But every time I bought
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.120]  like a new, new Mac, and then would buy the RAM separately, and which I would do because the
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.320]  prices were so ridiculously better. And you never got enough RAM in the default configuration from
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.040]  Apple. I did it. But it always every single time I buy a new Mac, I think, well, maybe this time,
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.960]  I'll let Apple give me the RAM. And then I'd go there and compare the prices. I'd be like,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.280]  no way. Yeah, it's gotten better. But yeah, it's not good. But so they do play into it. And I
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.920]  remember you and I talking about it. And we even said, like, look, you know, it's easy for us to
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.680]  spend Apple's money and say they should just, you know, give people things. But it's like when they
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.200]  had the lightning adapter thing, like, they should have just had buckets of those lightning
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.320]  to 30 pin things and just given them to people in the store. Just, you know, people come in and say,
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.240]  hey, you know, my husband has the old phone. And I've got the new phone. And now our cables don't
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.560]  work here. Take a couple. Here, have a couple of these. Just something cheap, very cheap for
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.360]  Goodwill. Right. Whereas their answer was, well, give us $29 and we'll sell you one. Or maybe it
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.560]  was 19. But either way, it just it made people feel it. So people have that sense. And Apple
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.040]  does do certain things that play into it. And I feel like iSupply's whole thing with these
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.480]  press releases is just catered to hit that perception, you know, that Apple is ripping us
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.600]  off. And it's like, I definitely think that the USB adapter for the MacBook does not cost $80 or
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:56.080]  even close to it. I think there's a pretty stiff markup on that. I do not think that the Apple
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:05.920]  watch board costs $83 to make. And this, yeah, the other thing that bugged me in this this venture
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:11.760]  beef piece that you will send me the link to is that this part, perhaps the most interesting
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.360]  component price is the analysis in this and the analysis is that of the battery 80 cents.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.840]  If IHS's estimate is correct, it seems that Apple spent a laughably small amount of money
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.120]  on the one component that seems to hinder the capabilities of the watch the most.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:33.520]  OK, well, that says nothing about what the other options were. Right. It's just like assuming that
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.480]  if they had spent more on the battery, then they would have gotten more battery. Well,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.120]  there may not be another option and there certainly may not be another option in that that
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:52.160]  size. Right. So it's just it appeals to it's it's just jokingly written, right? Like the even the
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.440]  people who bite and then write a story about it are then, you know, the only people who even
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.200]  buy into it are people who are such facile thinkers that they're subject to like analysis
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.480]  like that. Who knows? You know, and I don't know anything. Maybe maybe it literally is an 80 to 80
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:15.040]  cent component to put that battery in there. But there's it doesn't mean that it's it's not like
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.240]  there's empty space that they've left go. You know, it's not like if they had spent a buck 60 instead
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:30.720]  that you get two days of battery life. Right. Like, yeah, I just I doubt that that was I mean,
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:35.040]  given they're already that, you know, they already seem concerned about the battery life
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.280]  initially, you know, from the from the beginning, like they wouldn't mention it. And then they were
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.640]  saying, OK, we are we're carefully saying that they're setting this watch up so that it'll give
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.360]  you a day's worth of battery. I think if they had an option for a bigger battery, they probably
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:57.520]  would have gone for it. Yeah, I definitely think so. Or a better battery for the extra extra 20
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:07.360]  cents, right? Like I still don't I do find it like I find it unlikely that it's an 80 cent component
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:13.760]  because I've bought watch batteries before and like regular watch batteries, the ones that like
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:21.120]  you put in a Casio or like a Timex cost a couple bucks, you know. And I know that when you're
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.400]  buying at scale, you could get like, you know, it's different than going into the hardware store
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:33.760]  and buying one watch battery. But that's a watch battery that runs like a totally low powered
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:40.480]  machine. And this is a battery that runs like an iOS computer. So I really doubt that it's 80 cents.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:45.360]  It just gets me. It gets me. It's the I supply thing is like such a pet peeve of mine. And I
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:53.680]  know that I should just let it go. But I can't. I'm trying to see if the Taptic engine is on here
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:06.160]  someplace. Touch controller other. I mean, because there's a I mean, I'm assuming that that piece is
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.640]  that that's not a standard component that you can just pick up. You know, there aren't just like
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.000]  buckets of those. Obviously, there are not buckets of those things lying around someplace because
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.160]  their supply is constrained because they got a bunch of bad ones.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:27.760]  So how do you estimate something that was probably built pretty much specifically for this watch?
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.120]  I honestly have no idea. I think that they don't even try. I think that they just
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.880]  don't even. Well, it's like I can't pick it out here anyway. No capacitive. No,
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:45.440]  that because that's the screen. I don't know. I and every time I write about this,
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.480]  and it's been a hobby horse of mine for years. And if I write about it or podcast about it,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.720]  I always get some amount of feedback. Let me try to preemptively cut you off. Hopefully those of
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.160]  you who are doing this haven't started emailing me already. Like the response is usually from
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.600]  people who like read my site or listen to the show nuanced. And it's not just knee jerk. Oh,
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.200]  I know that it only costs $40 to make an iPhone and every meal. Like my readers and listeners
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.320]  are smarter than that, but they always emphasize the well, they're not. They're not trying to say
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:22.240]  that it takes into account, you know, the factory to build these things or assemble it. And,
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.760]  you know, they're just saying they're literally just saying what the components cost.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.560]  And they're not trying to, you know, to put research and development into it. And they're not,
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:37.200]  you know, that it is fair. But I think even if you take all that under consideration, it still
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.480]  clearly isn't right because I just, there's no way to mesh the fact that they're saying that this is
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:49.840]  the highest margin product Apple makes with Apple saying on a public analyst call that it's going to
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.760]  have a lower, not the lowest. They didn't say that. They just said lower than the companies
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.520]  average. So it cannot be true that the low and they're saying that the low, that's the lowest
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:05.680]  priced Apple watch. Well, it could be. I mean, I guess it could be true if you factor in those
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:12.000]  things that they are, you know, obviously not factoring in the logistics and the capital expenses
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.560]  and things like that. I just don't see how this is useful to anybody in any way. Right. Right.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.760]  Exactly. Other than people not trying to, you know, muck what to call it,
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.520]  muck, what's it called? Muck rake, you know, and, and, you know, seed this perception.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.160]  And nobody ever talks about like the I supply breakdown of the Samsung galaxy S six.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.280]  I don't see, I do not see the tactic thing called out anywhere here. So it must be embedded in one
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:46.320]  of these categories, which is just to me, I mean, because it's a brand new thing. You can't, right.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.200]  You can't, you can't, I mean, you're obviously just making an estimate, right. But then,
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:57.280]  then you obviously don't know. Uh, I didn't link to them yet. Hopefully I will before the
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.080]  episode airs, but, um, I saw two stories and I guess I'll put them in the show notes,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.520]  but that probably means I won't. Cause every time I say that, um, but I did write a note down here.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.680]  Um, speaking of components, I saw a thing that, uh, and the verge had it,
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.000]  Sony reported their results and they're there, you know, it looks like the company's doing
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.600]  pretty good and they're expecting the year to be really good. Um, but the thing that's holding
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.320]  them back, they're losing money on phones. And the gist of the verge story is maybe it's time
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.160]  for Sony to stop making cell phones because they're losing money on it. And at the company,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.800]  you know, the things where they're succeeding, like PlayStation's doing pretty well. Um,
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.320]  um, you know, and they're just not, you know, trying to give up the ghost on phones.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.120]  Uh, and I thought it was interesting because the other story I saw was that part of their results
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:56.080]  is that they are making Sony's making like 20 bucks a unit on iPhone six and the galaxy S six,
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:02.080]  because both of them are using Sony cameras. And I'm not quite sure if it's the whole thing,
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:07.120]  the lens and the center, but some part of these phones that have these, you know, these super
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:15.520]  great high end, um, camera phones, uh, are all using Sony optics. And I thought that was really,
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.600]  really interesting. And I, to me, it's Sony at its best, you know, and I've, you know,
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.760]  I've always been like a fan of Sony and I know Steve jobs was, I know a lot of Apple people are
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.000]  just because to me, Sony is one of those companies that appeals in the same way that Apple does,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.760]  where they sweat the details and, and stuff like that. And I think it's so interesting because I
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.120]  saw also that Canon had some really bad results, like quarterly results, you know, because camera
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.280]  sales are so down. And I thought, you know, it was really interesting because Sony, even though
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:52.880]  they make their own phones is in, was interested in making camera parts for would be competitors
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.960]  like Apple and Samsung and Canon, which doesn't make phones, doesn't have any kind of business
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:07.920]  like that. Yeah. And I know that maybe that's not really a sign of Sony, uh, having the,
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.080]  you know, a bill, Sony executives having the foresight to be like that. Maybe it's just a
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:20.080]  sign of how divided Sony is as a conglomerate, that maybe the people who make the phones at
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.920]  Sony are pissed that the imaging side of are making them for the phone. But either way,
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.320]  it's good for the company or at some point, you know, you know, the buck stops here and,
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.040]  and Sony as a company is doing something pretty smart to stay relevant in a world where people
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.600]  aren't buying Sony phones. And people are using the phones they are buying from Samsung and Apple
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.920]  to take their pictures that they're getting a piece of it. Yeah. I don't really remember them
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:55.040]  making cameras. Well, they do now though, because they haven't, they bought, they have a brand name,
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.440]  they bought Minolta. So Minolta doesn't exist anymore. Okay. Um, a couple of years ago,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.080]  they bought Minolta and they actually make like the Sony cameras are actually excellent.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:13.040]  They they're some of the really cutting edge stuff. They make good SLRs. Um, and they're
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.240]  mirrorless ones, you know, these new ones that are like, basically like in layman's terms,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.280]  a really good camera that doesn't work anything like an SLR doesn't have any kind of clacking
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.520]  mirror. So it's silent. Some of theirs are just amazing, really, really groundbreaking stuff.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:36.000]  Okay. I can't think of the last Sony product that I owned. Frankly,
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.360]  it's, it's so funny, because, you know, after owning them throughout the 80s, and,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.320]  you know, in well into the 90s, it's so funny, because I feel like the one of those,
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:53.800]  like anachronisms that it's getting ready to pop our mirrored SLR cameras, digital SLRs. Um,
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.000]  you know, like in a way that like smoking in a restaurant, like you just can't even imagine
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.600]  anymore. Like it stands out to me like that you see it, the only people who really use them
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.600]  anymore. I shouldn't say only but where I really notice it is news media, like super professional
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:15.840]  high end news media. So like, President Obama comes out in a rose garden to talk about,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.480]  you know, the news of the day, what do you hear, you hear this like machine gun fire
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:28.000]  of photos, and you never heard it in the old days pre digital, because there was no point
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.840]  when you were only could put 36 images on a roll of film of shooting all 36 images in a second.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:41.280]  Right. Like, you know, the, you know, the old way of shooting, I'm sure they shot a lot of film,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.720]  I'm sure that like the, you know, the newspaper reporters for the major newspapers,
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.760]  uh, the photographers, I'm sure they shot, not, not the reporters, the photographers shot a lot
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.280]  of images compared to like what a consumer would do, but they wouldn't just hold the button down
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.440]  and let it shoot as fast as it could. Whereas now they do, they just shoot and shoot and shoot and
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.520]  shoot to get whatever image they want. Just that one, that one special image.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.400]  The noise really started to, starting to bother me because like nobody else in the world uses
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.920]  these cameras that make noise anymore. Like you go to school events, you don't hear people's
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:16.080]  cameras clicking anymore. Everybody's cameras are drop dead silent. Do you know where else I noticed
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.560]  it? I noticed it when I watched that, uh, weird baseball game yesterday, the, the,
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.360]  Oh yeah. The Orioles game. Yeah. So anybody who didn't see me link to it on during fireball,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:32.400]  Baltimore, the city of Baltimore as is having, um, a lot of protests over, um, the police treatment,
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:38.720]  uh, of the citizens of Baltimore. Uh, is that a good summary? That's yeah. So protests in the
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:44.640]  streets. Um, the protests got a little ugly, uh, over the weekend. And there was a baseball game
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.560]  Baltimore where, where the fans had a hard time getting out of the stadium because they,
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.040]  the fans exiting the ballpark were right there where the protests were and it was nighttime and
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.880]  it was a little scary. And the police had also, I don't know if they had, if this was going on at
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.640]  the same time as that, but they had also, they several times they shut down the public
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:09.600]  transportation. Yeah. I saw that too, which is so, uh, yeah. You're leaving a ball game
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.800]  and there's no public transportation. It might be a little difficult to get around. Yeah. Well,
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.720]  if in Philly, it would be that, I mean, there's thousands and thousands of people who come to the
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:23.280]  game in their cars in Philly, but I, I, I, some huge proportion of every game is taking the
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.560]  subway home. If they shut down the subway, it would be a nightmare. And at Camden yards is
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.920]  probably better located in Philly. We, we keep our ballparks way down at the end of the city. Like
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.120]  everybody has to go somewhere. Like, you know, I don't know. It would be, if, if public
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:45.120]  transportation had to be sit down, shut down for whatever reason, like a flood or a protest or
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.800]  a strike, even if it was just like a, you know, a public transportation worker strike, I could see,
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.840]  I don't know, maybe they wouldn't, if they had enough notice, they wouldn't cancel the game,
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.760]  but I could see how they might have to. So I could see that. Anyway, whether it's well-intentioned
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.480]  or not, they played, played a baseball game, professional baseball game yesterday without
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.120]  the public in the stadium. So there was nobody there except for the team and a couple of
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.040]  employees. And I guess there were scouts from other teams were allowed to show up. So there
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:21.200]  were, you know, an empty, a ballpark that fits 50, some 51,000 people had nobody in it. And why
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.040]  I watched the game for an inning or two, just to see how weird it was and it was super weird
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:36.480]  and you could hear this. That's gotta be, I can't imagine what it's like playing that game.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:43.200]  I can't either. I mean, not only is there, you're, you're losing the enthusiasm of the crowd,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.360]  but then you have all these noises that you've never heard before.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:53.280]  Yeah. I never really paid attention to anyway. Right. Like it'd be, you know, I don't know,
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.960]  like your, your, it, it, it must've, I don't know. I haven't seen enough. I saw a lot of
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.000]  people writing about what it, we have weirdos, but I didn't see a lot of quotes from the players
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  talking about whether it was tough, you know, like to keep their concentrate, you know, like if it,
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.960]  did it feel real? I don't know. Yeah, I would think that it wouldn't, but you know, it seems
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.760]  like a, like a practice. But I just remember thinking like in a regular stadium when, you know,
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.600]  even if the, if you're not a popular team, but the Baltimore Orioles are pretty popular and they,
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.800]  you know, usually have a good, really good crowd, great fans. It doesn't matter what brand camera
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.040]  you have. If you're like a professional photographer, your camera isn't making
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.280]  noise that bothers people. But like in that game, it definitely was. And that's like,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.800]  I think if you're a professional photographer, even if you're a sports photographer,
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:42.080]  you've kind of got to be an extrovert to some degree where you're walking around with this big
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.640]  camera and a big obtrusive lens, and you're taking people's pictures and you're used to,
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.640]  you know, asking their name so you can get their name or whatever and the rights to use the image.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.000]  You know, and I'm a little bit more of an introvert. I don't want to, you know,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.520]  I don't, I don't want to be noticed. I, I would have, it would have been unbearable to me to be
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.920]  like behind home plate, clacking my camera, knowing that like the pitcher and hitter
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.400]  would have driven me nuts. And it didn't matter. And it's like, that's just baseball, right? Because
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.160]  something bad is going to happen for one of them, right? Either the guy is going to make an out
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.920]  and it's bad for the hitter or the guy is so someone, someone can blame you,
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.280]  but no matter what happened in every at bat, I would be like, Oh, that was me, right?
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:30.720]  Like I made the guy throw a bad pitch or I made the guy strike out. I, I, I wouldn't have been
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:35.120]  able to stand it. And it's getting, it's getting to a point where there's no technical reason why
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.200]  these guys couldn't use mirrorless cameras that you just push the button like your iPhone and it
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:47.200]  doesn't make a noise. Yeah. We actually had film developed recently for the first time in
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:55.120]  15 years, probably, you know, 12 years, because one of the things that they suggested taking to
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:04.080]  this fifth grade camp that I went with my son to is was waterproof cameras. So Karen bought a
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:11.920]  couple of disposable waterproof cameras, which are still, you know, film based. So, you know,
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.720]  and it's funny getting pictures back and particularly pictures that were taken by an
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.160]  11 year old and the results that you get, there's a couple of good, there's a couple of good ones,
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.160]  but you know, he shot two rolls of film and a lot of them are just like, you know, up in the air,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:34.400]  the ground, there's a tree. I've said this before. Did your family take a lot of photos growing up?
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.200]  No, I wouldn't. Well, no, I wouldn't say a lot. I mean, we took, we took a fair number,
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.920]  but nobody was, uh, I got into, I got into cameras in junior high school.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.160]  I wish that was probably, I wish I had, I don't know why I didn't. I honest to God,
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.400]  don't know why I didn't. I even got super involved at the student newspaper at Drexel
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.720]  in the nineties and never got involved in photography. And I have no idea why I didn't.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.480]  Cause I, then I would have had a dark room. I would have had my own dark room and I could've,
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.920]  I could have blown that papers funds on development and for film.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.960]  Yeah, I did that as I did. We, I mean, I took a class in junior high school for forget. I think
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.880]  it was over the sun. I think it was a summer thing. And, um, yeah, we did. So we did develop,
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.440]  we developed black and white stuff. I got in, I shot film then for a couple of years. I got it.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.160]  I did get my first like SLR and I did start getting into photography right after college.
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.440]  And I immediately thought, why the hell didn't I do this when I was at student newspaper?
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:38.560]  They needed me. We always, we always were desperate in need of, of, uh, decent photographs.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.880]  Um, I'm not, I'm not any good though. I mean, I just, I don't have a very good eye and like my
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.680]  wife just has a much better eyes. She, she can take better pictures than I can, but you know,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:53.920]  I think I learned, I learned a lot and it was kind of, it was cool to be able to do that at the time.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.240]  Boy, I missed my Pentax K 1000 though. Oh, what was that? That was a sweet,
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.960]  that was a fully manual camera. Oh God, it was gorgeous. What was the model name?
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.000]  Got stolen Pentax K 1000. Oh, I've seen that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It got stolen.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.760]  And yeah. And for a long time, those were, those were highly coveted because they were used a lot
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.640]  in, in, in photography classes because they were fully manual. Right. And they, you know,
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.560]  that thing was a brick too. I mean, it was, it was built like a brick shit house.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.400]  Pentax always had, maybe they still have, I shouldn't talk about them in the past tense,
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.120]  but although I can't remember the last time I heard of somebody buying a Pentax,
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.600]  but I remember Pentax always had a good reputation for that. The controls were nice.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:38.320]  Like photographers, photographer, you know, like what you'd want. Like if you,
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.200]  if you wanted to change the aperture, you'd want to do it this way. And that's how they did it.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:46.160]  And then, you know, the things that you turned out a good feel and stuff like that.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.520]  Mm-hmm. I still have that when I got his replacement, which was an ME
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.240]  with a couple of lenses, just sitting on a shelf.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.320]  My family was not a photography family, which is probably why I just didn't get the interest in
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:02.640]  it. Like we, and we joke like Amy's family was sort of the same way and we joke. And it's really
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:09.280]  no exaggeration that there are roles of film from like the early eighties that that's under
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:16.560]  undeveloped. No, but the, the, you know, like 24 exposures and they start at the Jersey shore
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.880]  on a summer vacation. And then they end with me and my sister opening Christmas presents.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.040]  You know, it was like they would, we would take the camera on vacation and then, you know,
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.520]  shoot a couple of photos at the beach. And, but you know, we don't want to waste the whole role.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.520]  And then next thing you know, it's Christmas morning and Santa came and it's like, Hey,
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:45.040]  get the camera. Someplace I have a roll of film that's undeveloped. Like, I think it's in my
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.080]  dresser or something like that, but you know, you used to, because the films would come in
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.440]  different speeds and, you know, and then sometimes they would shoot black and white and color.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:59.200]  And so you, you would sometimes take out a roll of film that was not finished, roll it back up
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.320]  into the, into the thing without rolling it in all the way. Remember right on it, how many pictures
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:11.440]  you had taken, and then you, you, you could put it back in later and go past that to, to use up the
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.960]  rest of the role. And so I have one of those that's, it's, I'm sure it's been lying around.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:23.440]  I think it, I think it had even been lying around like long before I switched to digital. So it's
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.440]  probably from like the early nineties or something like that. And I have no idea what's on it.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.280]  It's still not developed. I should probably do it before all development goes away completely.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.160]  It was, it was the worst even. And when I got into shooting film, it, you know, I wasn't,
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:43.600]  you know, I mean, water money runs through my hands like water. I mean, I was never afraid to,
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.040]  you know, if the day's event that I wanted to photograph, I shot 20 exposures. I didn't give
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:56.080]  too much of a care about, well, let's take four pictures of, I don't know. But you do,
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.680]  you did have that sense though, that every time you press the shutter, you were spending like 50,
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.840]  you're spending money, spending some kind of money, you know, like 25 cents, 25 cents,
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.800]  25 cents. And that's even if you're just like getting them developed at like, you know,
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.360]  the drug store or whatever. Yeah. And you get them back into crap and you just be furious.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.560]  Right. And I remember I used to shoot Kodak. I love Kodak Tri-X and I wasn't, again, I was super,
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:26.160]  super, you know, casually into film photography. I mean, and there's so many people who know way,
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:30.880]  way more about black and white film than me, but Tri-X to me was neat because it was super friendly
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.760]  to a not so good photographer. It had a wide range. It was ISO 400, so you could use it in
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.600]  pretty low light. And it just tended to have this high contrast black and white look that I really,
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.680]  really liked. And it's so funny to me in the years since I think about it too, where I would just pop
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.520]  Tri-X into my camera and go out and shoot photos. And again, I don't really have a great eye. I
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:56.800]  don't think there's any chance that I was ever going to, you know, be a professional photographer
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.960]  in any sense. You know, I'm lucky if I got, you know, out of 24, if I got two or three interesting
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.560]  shots. Never was really good at looking at the real world around me in color and trying to figure
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.120]  out what would look good in high contrast black and white. But then you just take it to the place
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.480]  and then they give you your 24 things and it'd be like, man, these photos look so cool. And, you
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:23.600]  know, like people's faces, it would be like, you know, the right mix of light and dark. And then
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.600]  knowing in hindsight, like when you take a color photograph and go into Photoshop or anything,
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.360]  how tricky it is to make a really cool high contrast black and white
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.520]  mix. Whereas the film, it just happened. It just, you know, automatic.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.480]  Yeah. You're a black and white man or you shoot color?
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.680]  I was. I was black and white for a long time. I mean, I mostly, well, for a long period,
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.400]  it was, I was shooting just black and white. So from that point where I took that class in
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:57.280]  junior high school through probably through college, I think I shot all in black and white.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.520]  And then when I went to Japan, so I guess like in my junior year in college, when I went to Japan, I
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:09.440]  wanted to shoot in color while I was there. So that's probably about when I switched,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.320]  but then I say, you know, on and off, I would still, I would still shoot black and white.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.080]  All right. Let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. And they've sponsored the show before,
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:26.720]  but not for a long time. It's our good friends at audible, a U D I B L E the ebook or the ebook,
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:36.800]  the audio book company, largest selection of audio books in the world. They have over 180,000 titles,
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:45.040]  new titles, probably every week, maybe every day. I don't even know. You can just sign up and
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:52.800]  subscribe and start downloading audio books instantly. A long time sponsor of podcasts
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.960]  for the obvious reason that if you are listening to me talk to you right now,
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:04.000]  you are the sort of person who listens to people talking on a thing. And maybe you have a commute.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.160]  Maybe you listen to podcasts while you work. Maybe you do it while you exercise, who knows,
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.200]  but you're obviously listening to spoken word content. And that is what audible has,
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.680]  long form books, real books, and a great deal. And so if you consume lots of podcasts,
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.680]  if you're the sort of person who wishes that I came out with more podcasts and,
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:32.400]  and you love it when my podcasts run long and you need more stuff, if you haven't looked at
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:38.800]  audible and eBooks for high quality content, well, you should, because it's amazing. It's,
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.680]  you know, I'm going to say literally, and I think I actually mean literally,
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:49.520]  literally not literally in the new sense. That means figuratively a library of book length
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:56.000]  content, 180,000 of them from all the top broadcasters, publishers, entertainers,
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.480]  and more. And you can go there, here's the thing, you can go and get a free audiobook of your
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:06.880]  choice and a free 30 day trial membership. So I'm not even asking you to spend money,
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:15.520]  you can just go there. You got to go to audible podcast.com, a u di bl e podcast.com. That's
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.920]  their domain slash the talk show. They've got the the and the slug, audible podcast.com slash
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.520]  the talk show. Go there and you get a free book, you get a 30 day membership where you can download
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.680]  all sorts of other stuff to listen to. And there's the thing, they always want the host of the show
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.240]  to pick a book, which I was going to, I was going to ask, I was going to ask, but this time it's
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:41.920]  such good timing. I is no brainer, totally easy. No brainer, uh, becoming Steve Jobs,
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:45.760]  the evolution of a reckless upstart into a visionary leader. That's the book that came
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:52.800]  out a few weeks ago. Uh, I think in March by, uh, Brent Schlander and Rick Ted Zellie. Uh,
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.840]  and I've been writing about it on during fireball a few times. I interviewed those guys on stage
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.000]  in New York to talk about it, uh, last month. Uh, I just think it's not a perfect book. It is not.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.600]  And I know like Jason snow and a few other people have brought up some of the things,
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.440]  and some of the things are just, they could have been caught with like a technical editor
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.760]  because it's just stupid stuff. Like getting the name of certain max wrong or certain technical
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.520]  details like, cause these guys are, they're business writers and they're writing about Apple
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.200]  as a business and they're not writing about it from the get all the details. Right. And I know
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:29.120]  people like me, it's annoying when you see a stupid technical error in there. Um, I get
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.800]  annoyed when people don't, you know, capitalize Mac world. Right. And I think that they capitalize
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:38.960]  macro. Yeah, they, they came up case to right. So I, I know, I know, but seriously, the book is
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:45.680]  like 99% great and it has some really, really good original stuff, um, that nobody else has
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:53.600]  ever had. It has a really neat personal touch and it has a long term view on jobs as business life
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.960]  because branch lender had been writing about him and talking about him and, and part of his life.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:06.320]  And, you know, visit him in his home every couple of years for decades. Um, it's tremendous. I think
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:12.320]  this is great. Uh, personally, it's an unabridged audio book, 16 hours, 21 minutes. So you're not
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.320]  missing a damn thing. So if you haven't read that book yet and you love books, go there. They've got
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:23.200]  it. You could do this as the, uh, uh, as you're free with 30 day trial membership book becoming
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:29.760]  Steve jobs by a branch lender and Rick Tedzily. So my thanks to audible. And again, the URL is
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:35.840]  audible podcast.com slash the talk show. I see in their homepage, the, on the main
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.520]  on the main page, they have, uh, the Martian, which is a really good book that, uh, I just
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:48.160]  finished reading with my son and, um, he's, you know, he likes, he's not crazy about reading
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:54.080]  novels for some reason. He really likes reading, uh, nonfiction and tends to do that. So we were
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:57.680]  trying to get them into novels and the way I got them into this was I told them there was a lot of
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.720]  swearing in it. Um, and there is, there's a lot, there's a fair amount of swearing in it. And, uh,
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:10.000]  but it's very funny and there's no, there's no bad violence. There's no crazy sexual situations
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  in it. Um, it's, there's a lot of hard science fiction and some, some swearing that he found
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.240]  quite amusing. So, uh, we plowed through that together and he really enjoyed that.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.720]  Ah, so I think it's a, it's a really good book, hard science fiction about a man mission to Mars.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.720]  Yes. I got stuck in, it's becoming a movie, I think coming out in the fall. I'm not mistaken
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:36.160]  with Matt Damon. There you go. I saw him at the immersion. I saw him stranded on a planet already.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:43.520]  Well, I guess he's getting typecast. Yeah. He's a much nicer guy in this one though.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.000]  Uh, they've got the game of thrones stuff, all that. So anyway, thanks to audible.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.760]  I honestly got, you could consume your entire life listening to audible books.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:58.720]  Uh, sorry. What else is going on? What else we got? Why don't we talk about earnings?
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.760]  What was the other, what was the other, did we do both the links that you sent me?
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:11.920]  Uh, Oh, that it goes into earnings where it's the iPad. So Apple reported earnings and, uh,
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:19.600]  the iPhone is gazinga. It's going nuts. They're like the most seriously it's, it's, it's insane.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:25.040]  How often can you say it, but it's seriously, it's probably the single most popular and successful
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:32.320]  product in the history of like modern manufacturing. Yeah. And some people kind
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.840]  of use that as a club because they say that Apple's solely an iPhone company now. And
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.760]  that's their big problem because boy, if something happens to the iPhone, like something is just
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:47.040]  going to happen to the iPhone, then there'll be in big trouble. So look out. Well, I do,
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.960]  I, you know, and there was a New York time, sorry, I don't even want to put it in the show notes
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.640]  cause it was so stupid. It was like, uh, can Apple stay on top forever? Apple can't stay on top
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.520]  forever. Just ask IBM. And it was a stupid, stupid article because it didn't even say
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.840]  that just the whole article could have been replaced with what goes up, must come down.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:11.120]  And I don't know that there's anybody who's arguing that Apple will remain the biggest company
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:17.520]  forever because I mean, it's, you know, the heat death of the universe is imminent, right? I mean,
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.240]  something's going to happen eventually. Like tell me, give me something. It was like a lot of
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.760]  people pointed to me on Twitter and I can't wait for the claim chowder on this, but it's actually
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.200]  claimed chowder proof because he didn't say anything that could ever be disproven. He didn't
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.280]  say five years from now. Yeah. Five years from now, Apple will not be the biggest company or
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:43.040]  10 years from now. Unlike trip chowdery. You're right. 60 days. You know, that's a good point
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.320]  though that that let's hear it for trip chowdery at least putting a line in the sand, right?
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.800]  He's his trip chowdery's thing was a year ago that Apple had to, uh, what was it? Well,
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.080]  he has a whole lot of them actually, but, uh, I think the one that you're thinking,
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.480]  they needed to come out with a bigger phone within 60 days or, or face irrelevancy.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.680]  Yes. They would go into permanent decline and they, and they missed his 60 day period by at
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:16.000]  least five or six months. Uh, and still seem to be doing okay. Yeah. But at least again, give it to
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.400]  him. He was incredibly wrong, terribly sensationalist as shamelessly making a statement.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.600]  In my opinion, that he probably, he either has brain damage or, uh, you know, a substance problem
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.640]  or he knew exactly what he was saying and just knew that it would get quoted.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.760]  Right. Which is my theory is that a lot of these guys like him and Rob Enderle and
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.520]  everybody always asked me, what is with these guys? And I, I, my answer is I think the answer
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.760]  is what they're good at is they're good at getting their name out there and being quoted
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.160]  because, and then that leads to consulting work because people say, Rob Enderle,
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.000]  I've seen you on TV and I've seen you quoted in the New York times. I, you must be smart.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.680]  I will hire you. And I think they ever been for a big surprise. Never. Yeah.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:02.240]  Yeah. You know, I met him. You met Enderle?
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:08.160]  Yeah. Almost all. Well, I, I, wait, you met him almost. Well, yeah, I chickened out.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.360]  Okay. I don't think, I don't think I could do it either.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:15.600]  When I was in San Francisco, I have not told this story. It's a good story. When I was in
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:23.520]  San Francisco last September for the iPhone event, I believe it was the iPhone might've
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:32.080]  been the iPad in October, but it was iPhone. Uh, the next day T-Mobile had an event right there
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.640]  in San Francisco, right there on market street. I think you and I have been there. It's that
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.840]  the bar that looks like an old, it's supposed to be like an old newspaper,
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.440]  you know, like five late edition or something like that early edition.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.440]  Oh, that sounds familiar. I can't picture. I can't picture it.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:54.000]  Let me see if there's a bar in San Francisco called early edition or maybe there, there was
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  cause they bars in San Francisco tend to have this, but they rented the whole place out early
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.600]  edition, local edition, local edition. Yeah. Local edition. So, uh, anybody who's interested
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.920]  and knows it's a six 91 market street. So they, the T-Mobile rented out local edition.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.200]  It's a pretty big bar for a cocktail bar. Um, and, uh, John Ligear, what's his last,
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:22.560]  how do you say his name? Ligear. You know, it was announcing, I think, I don't know,
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.360]  like their new unlimited plan or something like that. And they invited me and I never
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.960]  would have gone in a thousand years except for the fact that I was already in San Francisco
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.840]  and they didn't have to change any of my travel plan. So I thought, screw it. I don't, I, you
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.480]  know, act like a real, you know, somebody who covers stuff like this and I'll go. And I had
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.640]  a fun time. Um, but while I was standing in line waiting to go in, I realized that Rob
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:47.200]  Enderle was right behind me in line. Like he was the person behind me. I was talking to, uh,
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.280]  I forget who I was talking to from, uh, the verge. Somebody from the verge was right in front of me.
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.960]  Dieter Bohn was right in front of me and I was talking to him. We were talking about the phone,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.360]  you know, the iPhone. And I realized Rob Enderle was right behind me. And I really thought about
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.880]  introducing myself because I think I could pull it off. But my worry was that maybe he has no
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.840]  idea who I am and I didn't know how to, I didn't know how to do an it. That it wasn't like I got
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:18.320]  real shy and, and just totally chickened out and I got willing to face up for the number of times
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:26.960]  I have called him a jackass. Uh, but it would, I couldn't figure out a way to do it with playing
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.240]  both sides of the table of it's okay. Cause you know what I mean? Like I'm always, so for example,
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.840]  I always run into this when I go into an Apple retail store is a lot of times I go in and the
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:43.280]  people who helped me when they realize who I am, they, they acknowledge it and like, Oh, I,
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.080]  I love your site. Um, like they're obviously trained in the Apple stores and it's a funny
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.960]  thing. Like I'm not a celebrity, but in an Apple store, I'm a celebrity. Um, they're trained that
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:57.760]  if you recognize somebody, don't make a deal out of it, you know? So like if a true, like the mayor
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.160]  comes in, they're supposed to treat the mayor like a regular customer. So they, it's never uncomfortable,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.240]  you know, but other times it is clear that the person who's checking me out at the Apple store
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.840]  has no idea who I am, which is totally cool. I don't care. I don't want to be right. It's better.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:23.680]  Um, but sometimes it comes up like, um, uh, I, I bought, uh, Jonas's, uh, cause again,
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:31.360]  I'm a procrastinator. Um, instead of ordering it online, I bought Jonas's, uh, MacBook air on,
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:38.800]  in the retail store. And, um, cause I was getting close to Christmas and I couldn't trust the
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.560]  shipping. So, um, I went in to buy it and the guy, I was like, this is what I want to buy.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.360]  I want to buy this. And, um, actually it's a MacBook pro. I should have correct it because
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.000]  he wants to play Minecraft. Um, so anyway, I went in to buy a MacBook pro and I knew exactly what I
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.360]  wanted. Uh, and I knew they had it. And I said, this is why I want to buy. And the guy started
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.920]  giving me, well, what do you do? What do you, you know, what are you going to use it for?
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.720]  And I didn't want to tell him what I did. And just, just, just give me the platform
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.640]  because it was, I, it's like, well, I write a site where about Apple, it just seemed to me like,
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.800]  you know, if I said that, then it would be like, I'm implying you're supposed to know who I am.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.680]  And I don't think you're supposed to know who I am. But anyway, I couldn't figure out how to
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.160]  do it with enderlay and play both sides of the street where it would be like, Oh, we finally
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:28.400]  meet. Yeah, right. Right. Right. He's not, yeah. He's not expecting to have that moment. Yeah.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.800]  Right. But on the other hand, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be surprised if he has no idea. Never
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.720]  heard of me, never heard of anything. Cause I think he's, you know, he's so monomaniacally
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.520]  focused on getting quoted by like the New York times and getting on CNN and stuff like that,
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.960]  that, you know, my little thing doesn't even, well, he also just lives, he lives in a completely
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.440]  different world. Yes, exactly. He lives in a, he lives in a PC world, so he's not,
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:56.720]  you know, he, I, yeah, he probably does not keep up on, on our movements. Right. Like for example,
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:11.600]  also I've never met him, but what's his name? Windows guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Paul. Never met him.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:18.160]  Almost met him last year when I was out at Microsoft build conference. I was at the same
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:21.520]  like after party and I thought about going over it, but it was just real crowded and he was
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.240]  talking to somebody like I, there's, I wouldn't hesitate to introduce myself to him and I've
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.080]  linked to him sometimes complimentary. Sometimes I've agreed with him, but a lot of times over
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.440]  the years I've linked to him, you know, in disagreement, let's say. Sure. But I wouldn't
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.560]  hesitate to introduce myself to him, but I know that he knows who I am. So at least the context
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:48.560]  is there. He at least, I mean, you know, I don't think that every post that he makes shows this,
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.520]  but he at least is a guy who I know is smart. Yes. Yeah, I totally agree. Whereas with Enderle,
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.120]  I didn't know, I know, I don't know what that guy's deal is.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.120]  I kind of regret it though. In hindsight, I regret that I didn't figure, I think the way to play it
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:08.320]  in hindsight would have been to just overemphasize the humble part and just assume that he has no
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.000]  idea and say, Hey, my name is John Gruber. I write a site where I write about technology.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.800]  Yeah. But then why am I introducing me to you? That's the thing I couldn't get over is if I play
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.520]  it like that, like as though I don't expect him to know who I am, then I don't see the point of
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.160]  me introducing myself to him because really the point would be. Right. So there's this,
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.920]  the solution that my wife and I have come up to come up with in situations like that is just to
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:41.200]  touch the person. So we went to, we went to Penn and Teller, Penn and Teller one time. And you
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.680]  know, there's in the intermission, they come out into the lobby, at least they used to, this was a
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:50.000]  long time ago. And they just like, they mill around in the lobby and talk to people. And,
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:54.320]  and she's like, and we were, we were with a bunch of friends who were like, well, should we go,
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.880]  should we go talk to them? And they're like, I'm not going to say, what am I going to say? I don't
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:04.480]  have nothing to say to Penn Jillette. Right. And, and so my wife just goes, well, I'm just
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:10.560]  going to go touch him. So she just walks up to him and she just like pokes him on the arm and
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.840]  then just walks away. He's talking to somebody. He didn't even look at her. You just kept talking to
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:22.800]  the person and walked away. So like years later, I met him at Mac world, the conference, and I see
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:28.640]  Ron Johnson on the floor and I was like, Hey, this is Ron Johnson is like, he says Apple executives,
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.640]  like I had a retail. I was like, I was with a friend of mine and I'm like, I'm going to go
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.600]  touch him. So I just walked up to Ron Johnson, same thing, exact same thing. He's talking to
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:44.800]  some guy. I poke him in the arm and I walk away. He doesn't look at me. Nothing. Just like I touched
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:50.400]  Ron, Ron Johnson, John, you've told me a lot of weird stories over the years. I'm sure I told,
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.680]  I must've told you that. No, that's crazy. It's crazy that you walk away without expecting.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.040]  Like I really thought you were going to say like, you put your hand on the shoulder and wait for
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.440]  them to look at you. And then, no, no, you just like, cause it's the, that's the thing though.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.720]  It's like, I've really got nothing. I mean, it might be interesting to talk to him for a while,
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.280]  but I don't, you know, I don't know how to, I don't know how to broach that. I don't know
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.880]  what am I high. I wrote a stupid website there. I mean, I don't want to be that website. I don't
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:25.920]  want to obviously I'm an idiot. He doesn't want to talk to me. So I don't know. Plus I probably
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:31.920]  wrote something on cars. He didn't like, that's so crazy though. But then my second thought though,
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.000]  is that it's, it's a sign that, that you married, right. That you and your wife both agree that this
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.320]  is, that's the method. That's what you do in those situations. You just touch the person
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.160]  you've made, you've made contact and that's it. That's all you needed. Right.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.920]  Very, very funny. I think more, you know, more people should do that
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.160]  instead of making fools out of themselves. Right. Oh, where were we? We got sidetracked.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:06.160]  We were talking about the iPad. Yeah. Right. So, all right. iPhone, most successful product
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:13.440]  in history. The Mac is doing better, but it's like a, you know, it, it, it looks like a successful
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.800]  product in a very established category, which is exactly what it is. We're doing well is very,
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:24.000]  very stable and the growth while sloping upward, which is what a company wants to see.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.600]  It's sloping upward at a very, very gentle slope. Right. Whereas, but while the rest of that,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.200]  that category is going down, it's been going down. Yeah. And so if, yeah, the most impressive thing
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:41.200]  perhaps about the Mac is it's not it's slope compared to zero, but it's slope compared to
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:46.000]  the PC industry as a whole, which always confuses me too, because it's that PC industry as a whole,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:54.560]  including Apple, or is it, does it mean, does it mean windows PCs? Because Apple sells enough
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:46:00.640]  Macs now where that actually should fix the curve. Yeah. I don't know. But anyway, they sell, you
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:05.200]  know, the, the industry's in decline and the Mac is in a gentle rut. So that's good. And then there's
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:12.160]  the iPad, which has a very, very weird and quite, you know, frankly, if you like the iPad or if you
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:20.320]  you know, own Apple stock or whatever, you know, it worrisome perhaps because it's in decline.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.600]  And I will put this in the show and I just linked to it on during fireball before we started
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:32.160]  recording, but Dr. Drang had a really good post about how to visualize this, you know, and he
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.200]  pointed out that the way that the simple way of pointing it out, where you just show this quarter,
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.880]  that quarter, this quarter, that quarter, this quarter, that quarter and unit sales
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:48.560]  is disguises the trends because it's so skewed by the holiday quarters, which are even more
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.520]  skewed for the iPad the last few years, because that's also the quarter when the new ones come
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.720]  out. Like there's two reasons for there to be a burst in iPad sales. New iPads come out and
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.680]  people buying them for the holidays. And ever since they switched to unveiling them in October,
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:09.680]  that's the same quarter. So that one quarter a year has a spike. So he's using moving averages
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:13.520]  to show the, you know, each quarter's trailing four quarters average.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:18.400]  Which is a common thing in financial.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:24.880]  Yeah. It's not a way to modeling. It's not a way to make it look good or bad. It's a way to make it
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:31.200]  to make the trend, the actual underlying trend visible. Like I would say that the easy way of
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:38.320]  doing it isn't making it look good or bad. It just is sort of a noisy Apple's way, which he points
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:44.320]  out, which is to only show cumulative sales is let's face it sort of a euphemistic chart
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:51.040]  because cumulative always goes up. And this, you know, this moving average type thing,
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.360]  you can really see that there is, it's not just that that's flattened, but that they're actually
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:04.000]  in decline. Right. But that said, still it's a product that sold 13 million units last quarter.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.800]  It's not exactly a failure. And is that, well, so is the tablet market down as well? Yes,
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:18.560]  the tablet market is down as well. It is. And there is a reader I'll just quote it. Cause I
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.160]  thought it was, I've been trying to word it myself and I can't say it any better than this,
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:27.520]  but his explanation was, and I, he didn't link to me, but I've had this thing that it's, there's,
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.560]  there's a sort of durability explanation that people have bought iPads and they're still using
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.720]  the ones that they already had. And I'm not trying to justify, I'm not trying to spin it in any way,
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:42.720]  but I'm just trying to, you know, but I do think that's true. And I know this firsthand from like
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.680]  family members who have relatively old iPads, everything other than the original iPad is a
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:54.400]  totally credible iPad today. The original, which my dad still uses because he refuses to spend
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.120]  anything on anything, but suffers because of it. It's really, really hard to use. And I forget that
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.760]  later it's like, I still run iOS five or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. My father-in-law has that
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:16.000]  too. But the iPad two, which is a long time ago, that's a 2011 device is fundamentally the same
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:23.600]  internal specs as the current $249 iPad mini. It's, you know, the non retina screen, it's the
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:29.120]  same, a what four processor or whatever it was a sick, a five or whatever. It's an old processor,
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:37.600]  same lower amount of RAM. So it's effectively a 2011 iPad two, which was expensive, is the same
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:43.600]  as the $249 iPad mini you can go and buy today. Now I'm not saying that it's a great experience.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:47.440]  I'm guessing it's not a great experience with iOS eight, but it's still there.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.320]  But anyway, Dr. Drang kind of... It depends on what you're using it for though,
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:59.680]  because my wife has, has one that, you know, we bought when they came out and she mostly uses it
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.640]  for reading, which is of course, so it's course that's perfectly fine, but she, I mean, she'll
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.360]  play, you know, Alto's adventure. She plays a few, a few simple games. She doesn't, she's not,
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:14.960]  she's not playing, you know, like unreal engine. Right. You know, she's not playing anything that's
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:20.720]  heavy duty graphical. Can I tell you something? Yeah. I have never even looked at Alto's adventure
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:26.320]  yet. I came here and people, I just like the third time on a podcast in last week that I've
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.880]  heard somebody mention it as the, one of those things that like, you just assume everybody knows
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.120]  like the ATP guys talk about it is, you know, it's like all they talk about.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.000]  It's a good, it's a good game. What kind of, what kind of a game is it?
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:43.920]  It's like, um, did you ever play, what's the one with the not angry birds, but the one with the,
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:51.200]  uh, flat men have flappy wings, flappy bird flat. Now the one, uh, is it flappy bird? What is that?
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:59.280]  It's one of the birds. Like they go over Hills. Oh, I go down. Tiny wings, tiny wings, tiny wings.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.280]  Yeah. Um, it's a bit like, it's a bit like that. Um, except instead of pressing to go down,
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.000]  you press to make jumps. So you're a, you're a snowboarder and you have to do all these
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.040]  different kinds of jumps and jump over things and also like pick up things and, uh, and then escape
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:23.760]  from someone's chasing you. Uh, but it's good. It's, it's visually very nice and the music is
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:29.600]  nice and it's just, it's a very well-made game. Yeah. I probably wouldn't like that. Yeah. No
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:35.440]  one to blame but yourself. Um, anyway, one of his, in an update to Dr. Drang's post,
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:41.680]  he quotes a reader of his Ben Packard, um, who thinks that his durability explanation,
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.800]  Drang sort of said this durability thing is nonsense. Well, not that it's nonsense,
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.240]  but he kind of brushed it off earlier. And this guy says that the Mac he, and cause Drang's
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:54.000]  argument is why doesn't that apply to the Mac as well? And this guy says the Mac has been around
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.240]  long enough for there to be substantial numbers of owners at every stage of ownership. In other
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:03.520]  words, they have a brand new one, they have a medium aged one, middle aged one, or they have
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:08.880]  an old Mac that's ready to be replaced. Um, and I would also say too that the Mac's been around
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:15.760]  long enough that ownership is evenly distributed among people like, uh, idiots like me who buy new
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:21.200]  stuff every couple of years and people like my dad who will use an iMac until it breaks.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:28.400]  Right. Um, and that the iPad isn't like that at all for the iPad, uh, lots and lots of iPad users
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:32.960]  are still on their first iPad. And so we haven't gotten, you know, it'll take years before it evens
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:37.840]  out and smooths out. Right. And that people who want to have a new iPad every year or two because
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:43.200]  they're playing high end games, uh, will be smoothed out compared to people who just read
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.840]  novels on their iPad and play gentle games, you know, and stuff like that. And whatever the long
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.000]  term replacement cycle of iPads turns out to be, we're still in the first one, we're still in the
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.400]  first replacement cycle for too many of the variations. And I think that that's true. Um,
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:01.760]  But the, the other thing though, is that Apple kind of contributes to this by, like you said,
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:08.160]  the making the low end model last year's model or, or in this case, the model from several years ago.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:15.280]  So now, you know, mainly if you're a developer and you want to code something, you want to,
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:19.600]  I mean, I, and I know a lot of developers that complained about this because they don't want
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:27.520]  to have to code to these older iPads because it's, you know, the thing is not that powerful anymore.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.040]  Yeah. But they still, but they still feel that need to do that. So, you know, by selling,
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:39.200]  by continuing to sell those older, you know, the ones with the older internals,
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:47.200]  they're making the developers try and still make those viable machines, viable devices.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.720]  Clearly I'm not that keyed into the game industry. I would say almost famously so at this point, but
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:58.640]  it doesn't take a gamer to know that games are sort of at the forefront of that where games are
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:05.200]  the sort of apps that most want to take advantage of the latest and greatest hardware and things
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:12.480]  like metal and stuff like that. The only, you know, only applies to the latest hardware,
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:17.200]  the first, you know, the new generation hardware and Apple works against that in a couple of ways,
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:21.120]  not just by selling those things, but the way the app store is set up. And they, it's not,
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:28.160]  you can't just submit an app and say it only runs on the iPad air too, even if that's the truth.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:32.400]  And so you see these apps and games where there's like a warning, you know, they actually have to
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:39.760]  put like a warning in the description that's like, if you own an iPad mini, you know, or
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:45.520]  whatever, if you own any of these iPads, don't, don't buy this game. Yeah. Which is a really
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:54.080]  weird thing like that. People get mad. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're like, you know, I just bought
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.840]  this iPad and I can't play this game on it. That's ridiculous. Well, you know. Yeah. And then what
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.960]  do they do? They give comments on the app store. Yeah. Right. Right. And it starts a very, very bad
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:07.760]  circle. It's it just goes to show that there, you know, Apple's obviously not going to switch to it,
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:14.240]  but there is a certain, certain beauty to the console game model where they just say,
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.600]  they just say, okay, here is a generation product, the PS4, and we are going to sell this thing for
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.280]  five or six years, maybe more. I think maybe the generations are getting a little older, but,
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.080]  and then when you go buy a game, the game just real big, right up in the corner says PS4.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:35.280]  And then, you know, that that game will run as it was expected to run on the PS4 that you have
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.360]  hooked up to your TV. And I know, yes, there's different models and then you could, you know,
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.560]  I guess PS4 isn't like that, but with previous ones, some of them had bigger hard drives and
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:45.840]  some of it, but for the most part, you know, you knew, you knew what the target was going to be.
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.000]  So I don't know. I, what do you think is going on with the iPad?
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:53.360]  Yeah. I mean, I just think it's, I think, well, I think that,
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.440]  I mean, I do think it's the durability to at least a certain degree.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.400]  I think, and I'm, you know, and I don't, I don't know if durability is the right word.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:10.560]  I, I go back, it's like a legacy. I go back to the way that Apple framed the unveiling in 2010.
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:14.480]  And, you know, going back to the audible read that the, you know, the,
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:21.520]  even with the chair that was on the stage that Steve Jobs sat on, in the becoming Steve Jobs,
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:25.920]  they say, although the sourcing on that was a little, wasn't quite clear because nobody
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.000]  quite said it, but they made it pretty clear from their reporting that, that part of the reason for
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.640]  the chair was to show the iPad in the context they wanted to show it, which was sitting back
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:40.240]  rather than sitting forward. But it was also a concession to Jobs's physical stamina that,
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.920]  you know, he couldn't stand for two hours. But I do, I think fundamentally though,
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:49.680]  that there was something to that, that they picked the right way to frame it, which was,
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:56.000]  there was no device on the market that was meant for use handheld sitting back,
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.520]  whether you're sitting back in a chair or on a couch or laying on the bed or, you know, and,
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  you know, see it every time I get on an airplane, sitting on an airplane seat, sitting back,
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.400]  holding something in your hand, which is the traditional form factor of a book or magazine,
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.640]  right? Compared to something like a laptop that is meant to be laid flat on a desk while you sit
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:26.800]  forward. You should see my son use a laptop. He tucks the edge of it under, he'll lie down on the
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:32.240]  on the couch and he will tuck the edge, the front edge of it under his chin. I've seen that. I have
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:40.720]  seen that as well. I've seen that. But yeah, for the most part, yes. The form factor was not meant,
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:47.040]  is not conducive to those things. And so I think there was this enormous untapped market and it
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:55.040]  also coincided coming three years after the iPhone and what, almost 10 years after the iPod with
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:02.480]  finally, and I mean that, you know, in a real sense, finally, mass market awareness of Apple
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:10.080]  products, you know, and affinity for them that there was this huge untapped market because
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:15.440]  there'd never been a product that meant to fit it. And that overinflated the early years of iPad
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:21.520]  sales. Right. Yeah. And I really don't... I think that was definitely affected as well.
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:27.280]  Right. It was just untapped because like even, you know, the 11 inch air, which maybe at the time
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.680]  was like the closest thing anybody had to an iPad like device just wasn't good in any of those
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:37.440]  physical contexts, you know. Right. Right. I kind of wonder if the large screen iPhones will go
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:43.280]  through the same thing. Because there has been, there has been so much pent up demand for
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:48.000]  that form factor. And they're getting a bunch of people who are switching because
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.680]  they wanted an iPhone all along, but they wanted a big iPhone and now they've got one. And it'll be
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.640]  interesting to see what happens from here on out. I mean, I doubt that they'll have problems,
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:04.160]  you know, like serious problems, iPad like problems, but, you know, I wonder if the growth will...
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.960]  Not quite what it was. I do think, I think that there might be some potential for that.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:16.480]  Like one thing with the, with the iPhone that is remarkable is that they've never had a year
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:24.080]  over year, not even a drop though. I don't even think it's ever stayed flat. Every single year
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:30.960]  has been a year over year increase in sales. And for the first couple of years, now this was truly
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:34.560]  unsustainable. I know that the people have said a lot of the growth, you know, Apple and growth is
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:39.520]  unsustainable, has to, you know, law of large numbers, blah, blah, blah has to stop. The first
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:45.680]  few years, each successive generation of iPhone not only sold more than the one before it, it's
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:51.920]  sold more than all previous generations combined. I think that was true up until like the iPhone 4
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:58.080]  or maybe even 4S that like the iPhone 4 sold more than the original, the 3G and the 3GS combined.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:01.920]  And the 3GS had sold more than the original and 3G combined. And the 3G had sold more than the
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:07.760]  original, you know, like remarkable growth. Obviously that was not sustainable. That was
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:12.240]  at that sort of pace. It would, you'd very quickly run out of people on the planet, you know,
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:16.320]  would, you know, it's like, but it still is growing. But I do wonder if you're right though,
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:22.160]  that like there's so much pent up demand for a quote, big iPhone that was exactly like that,
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:25.840]  that maybe it suppressed sales for a few years beforehand. And now people, you know,
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:29.360]  now they've got it and they're happy with it. And, you know, yeah. And it's still, it might take a
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:35.920]  few cycles to fully flush out. Right. And then, and then maybe, and then maybe there's some other
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:40.640]  thing that they'll, you know, come up with to jam into, to reinvigorate again.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:48.880]  Yeah. I think by, by then, by then everyone will want to go back to small phones.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:58.160]  I think that it will. I think it'll go. I think that the first sign will be that the high end
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:04.080]  sales level off because it's going to reach, I do think that it'll have, it has to happen
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.360]  eventually. And there gotta be getting closer to it and that the growth will come by making more
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:16.080]  and better lower end iPhones to expand the market, you know, into other countries with lower incomes
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:22.000]  and stuff like that. Yeah. But that, which, which will go overall though, it might keep growing
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:28.640]  the number of users, but it's going to grow the financial implications of it eventually has to.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:35.280]  Yeah. But the thing, I mean, the thing about Apple with the large numbers is that they're very good
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.840]  about making sure that if someone's going to Campbell as their sales, it's going to be them.
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:48.080]  Right. And I think that helps protect them from that problem. You know, you don't, I mean,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.760]  what happens, you know, when you, when you're focused on so much on one product, you know,
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:56.560]  like we are this company and we make this thing and, you know, Hey, everybody loves our product
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.240]  and, you know, and then you get to the point where, okay, everybody has your product. Well,
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:07.360]  then they don't know what to do next. And Apple doesn't think that way generally, at least today.
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:16.400]  Let me take a break and do the, our last and final sponsor. And it's our good friends at
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:24.240]  automatic. Have you heard of these guys? Yep. Oh man. Automatic. It's, they call it a small
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:29.440]  connected car adapter. It plugs into your car's diagnostic port. Now I'm not a car guy. I didn't
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:33.760]  even know there was such a thing, but there is a standard car diagnostic port. And it's the same
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.120]  one that your mechanic users or your dealer, wherever you take your car, like when your car
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:42.320]  lights up and says you need service B2 or something like that, that that's what the
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:47.520]  service guy puts in and it tells the tells them, Hey, the oil's down to 5%. And you know,
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:54.320]  this is no good anymore. And then that's also how they reset those things. Like the way they said
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.160]  that the, you know, when they're done changing your oil, no car no longer tells you that all
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.400]  goes through this diagnostic port. And while you plug automatics, it's a dingus, right?
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:10.560]  You plug it in there, you plug the dingus in there. And every car since 1996 has one
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:17.440]  of these ports. It's a standard. And then it pairs to your phone over Bluetooth. And then when you
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:22.080]  when you drive, it connects your car to the internet and your car's on the internet because
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.600]  your phone while you're driving around. So what does it do? What's the point? Why would you want
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.280]  to do this? You're not a mechanic. If you were a mechanic, you'd already know about this, right?
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:35.040]  Well, you use their free mobile app and the mobile app shows you like let's say check engine light
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:40.000]  comes on. What the hell does that mean? Well, this port knows exactly why it came in. And so
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.480]  in plain English, it'll just tell you on your phone exactly what's wrong with your car. Like
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.760]  check engine light just means take the car to someone who knows what they're doing. Well,
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.000]  now you know exactly what it is. It could be something that is just complete nonsense,
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.120]  right? That you can just ignore. Maybe it's a serious issue. But that way you'll know what
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.560]  it is. You know, you know, you're not wasting your time or you or you know, you have a serious
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.080]  problem. And if it is a waste of your time, if it's something you don't care about, you just
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:06.000]  clear the light right there from the app, it goes over the diagnostic port, and then it won't bug
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.480]  you anymore. Super convenient. It logs your trips, it logs your parking location. So like when you
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:17.040]  shut the car off the automatic just says to the phone, okay, give me my location. Okay, boom,
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:21.440]  I know where I am. And then you don't remember where you parked. Well, you could just check the
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:29.440]  app and the app knows where you parked. And it also does some coaching with driving habits tells
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:36.240]  you how to drive what speed you know what kind of mile an hour or mileage you're getting could save
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:40.320]  you 100 if you're a person who drives a lot could save you hundreds of dollars a year in gas by
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.920]  giving you tips and scoring on driving sort of reminds me of Apple Watch like what Apple Watch
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.600]  does to sort of steer you towards better health and motion and movement. Automatic does for your
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:57.840]  car. It's like Apple Watch for your car. They're fans of the show. They remember the old episode
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:02.640]  with Dan Benjamin, where I talked about you remember this, I lost my license,
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:11.280]  because I got caught driving. I got caught. How fast was it? I think it was 90.
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:18.880]  And they give you a warning. They and they let you set it. Their default is 70. But you go over 70.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:21.840]  And it'll give you a little buzz like, hey, slow down, you know, lead foot,
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:28.720]  or to save me a lot of trouble. But you can customize that. So I would turn that up a little
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.280]  bit. 70 sounds a little low to me, I'd turn that up to at least 85. But then you get a nice warning
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:40.240]  when it goes off. And serious stuff. I'm joking around there. I never lost my license. But they
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:44.640]  have serious stuff like crash detection. So automatic can detect a crash and connect to
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:48.800]  your phone and call for help for free, which hopefully you'll never need. Hopefully you'll
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:52.800]  never be in a crash, frankly, but also hopefully you'll never be in a crash where it would actually
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.120]  help you if you know your car could do it, make the call for you. But if you needed it, well,
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:02.160]  it's there and it'll do it and a human will even stay on the line with you until hope or help
[02:06:02.160 --> 02:06:08.560]  arrives. They've got nest integration. So you can do things like get your home heated up or cool
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:13.600]  down, I guess we're heading towards summer as you're heading home. And all sorts of other stuff.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:19.600]  I mean, really, really, really deep stuff for nerds like where you can hook up to Google Docs
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:25.520]  and Twitter, and Evernote and just about anything with an API of connected home devices like the
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:29.280]  Philips hue lights, they can get integration with that you get your lights turned on before you come
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:36.240]  in. Anyway, all sorts of cool stuff. It's super, super simple free app. There's no subscription,
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:42.080]  you just buy the dingus, you buy the automatic dingus, it's $99 $99 95 cents, there's no
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:45.600]  subscription fee, you don't have to pay money every month to get the service to do all this,
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:51.920]  you just buy it, you plug it in, you have the app and it just works. Even better, use this URL
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:57.920]  automatic.com just like the automatic transmission, no funny spellings, automatic.com slash talk show,
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:03.840]  no the just slash talk show. And they're going to let you save 20% off, that's 20 bucks.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:11.600]  So for just 80 bucks, you'll get this super cool dingus for your car, ships and two business days,
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.480]  and they have a 45 day return policy. So use it for a month. And you still have two weeks
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.840]  left where you can decide whether it's actually worth it and whether you like it. And then if you
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:24.800]  don't, you can just send it back. It's another another good Mother's Day present, fantastic

[02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:02.400]  uh but anyway my thanks to automatic automatic.com slash talk show buy it it's super cool
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:06.480]  everybody the car should be built in with this thing that's the
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:12.080]  i'm telling you that's where this this is this is she wakes up and looks at the fracture picture
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.720]  of your of you that you gave her right exactly it's a Mother's Day spectacular oh my god that's
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:28.720]  fantastic uh so what else on the earnings or the ipad anything uh china gang gangbusters in china
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:35.600]  yeah and and did you see that uh ben baharan uh posted a did not start yesterday or today
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:45.920]  i can't remember um that showed the various market share i guess market shares in in china and
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:52.640]  apple's shoots up and xiaomi's shoots down so now apple is up over xiaomi's wow so they're like
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:09:01.520]  number one i think so yeah i have to find it yeah um pretty sure that's yeah and which is kind of
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:06.800]  ironic since we had to listen for so long about how apple was doomed in china because of xiaomi
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:11.680]  yeah well and ad apple was doomed without a low-cost phone like i feel like of all the ways
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:18.640]  that sometimes if i lose the forest for the trees with claim chowder it's uh it's over whether it
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:25.520]  was important or not you know like you know and and to me the apple needs a low-cost phone was
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.320]  important because these people they were very serious people who were making the argument
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.160]  in the most dire terms possible that the only way the ipad or iphone could continue and and
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:40.960]  be any meaningful success for the company would be if they went after the low-cost market they've
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:46.080]  already got the high-end market they gotta go low uh or else they're doomed and i mean you you could
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:51.520]  fill a book with the claim chowder on that and what did they do they raised the prices they raised
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.600]  the price the average selling price is like sixty dollars higher year over year because the iphone
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:04.480]  6 plus starts a hundred dollars higher uh and so many people are buying the iphone 6 uh instead of
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:10.720]  like the mid-range phone uh so that their average selling prices went significantly higher not just
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:15.120]  like oh it's a you know put an asterisk next to it it's actually a dollar higher than a year it's
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:22.480]  like 60 bucks a phone higher uh and and it was like they're never going to succeed in china
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.320]  without a low-cost phone yeah right and instead they've had unprecedented success in china with
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:34.880]  their most expensive iphones ever yeah they're number yeah they're number one now xiaomi's
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:43.440]  number two way and samsung and then lenovo send me that url paste that paste that out yeah and
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:51.680]  then paste it so i can forget to put it in the show notes sure absolutely um i i think that's
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:56.960]  interesting and i think it's i talked to somebody years ago and i know it's it's hyperbole because
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:02.640]  it's it's like the opposite but the gist of the argument i heard a few years ago is that there's
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:08.000]  no such thing as emerging markets that that's this at least from apple's perspective there aren't
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.600]  there's people who can afford to buy apple products and there's people who can't and yes
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:20.880]  they're the the distribution is not the same from country to country um but that all sorts of other
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:26.400]  things change from country to country you know and that people in germany buy products for different
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.200]  reasons than people in france even though germany and france are like economically peers in terms
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:38.080]  of like income and stuff like that but that in germany i i could be you know i could be getting
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.840]  this wrong this might not be right but it's you know like maybe in germany it's like it's a lot
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:47.280]  more important that if everybody you work with uses this brand that you would use that brand too
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:51.920]  whereas in france it's more of an individualist thing and maybe if you notice that a lot of
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.600]  people you work with use the apple phone that would make you more likely to buy a samsung
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:59.280]  phone to be different because it's cultural different you know but that the economic
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:04.400]  differences are just another factor in this incredibly different you know difficult matrix
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:10.160]  of what is going to sell where but that the fact that there's billions of people in china and that
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.800]  their overall average income is actually pretty low and a lot of them by u.s standards it's
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:19.760]  incredibly low like it's not possible for them to buy an iphone doesn't mean that they need to
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:25.680]  cater to that market to to survive and i think i think the thing i saw and again i could be wrong
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:29.840]  on this but it makes sense to me is that there's more millionaires in china than any other country
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.400]  in the world maybe i'm wrong about that it could still be the united states but i'll bet that it's
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.520]  if it's not number one it's probably getting pretty close yeah right yeah and i mean they're
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.800]  middle classes as balloon which is one of the things that tim cook talked about on the conference
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:51.680]  right so they're you know they're that's that's the perfect yeah people that apple apple sells
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:56.400]  to and i you know i don't think apple sees the future i think you talk to people at apple they
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.200]  you know they make good educated guesses but then they look and then they adjust you know and
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:05.760]  clearly you know like one of the adjustments is clearly that they got caught a little flat-footed
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:12.480]  on the big screen trend with smartphones and it it actually goes back to what we and i were talking
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:18.400]  about in the first hour of the show on production and how do they produce this amazing number of
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.960]  iphone six and six pluses the soon right out of the gate the first day that they're supposed to
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:27.520]  be available well one of the ways they do that is they kind of started the train on that like
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:32.640]  two years ago like this year's iphone was started two years ago you know next year's you know the
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:36.560]  one that there's the brand new phone there's some team somewhere at apple starting work on a brand
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:42.400]  new iphone right now that's not coming to market for another two years and so if the trend towards
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:48.800]  big iphones became evident to them too late there's no way to catch up quickly because it you know
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.040]  you can more or less tell when they decided that they needed to make a bigger iphone because it was
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:14:00.400]  about two years before the iphone six and six plus came out um so they definitely followed trends
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:05.200]  out yet but i think overall though they're very very you know it's a going where the puck is going
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:11.120]  to be by staying high end in china then going low end right because it's it's there's so much
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:16.160]  economic growth there in that country yeah but do you so do you think long term that they would
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.600]  they would go further down the scale though i think eventually they'll have to i think because
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:26.480]  it's just the inevitable way that all computers go like eventually it really will go good enough
[02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:31.120]  i mean i mean just look at the mac like i mean we're talking about on the scale of
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:39.280]  wow i'm really starting to get bad at math 31 years right for the mac so mac is a three decade
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:46.960]  old product um and it's still relatively high end like the cheapest mac you can buy the 899 macbook
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:56.720]  air is pretty expensive compared to pc laptops um but the idea of an 899 mac laptop i mean go back
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:04.000]  15 years and that is crazy town that's you know i'm talking about a very long scale at least five
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.600]  six seven years you know that at some point there's going to have to be new iphones that
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.080]  are at a lower price and there still might be an iphone pro i mean call it whatever you want
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.360]  like the macbook pro um but i think the price on that is going to have to come down eventually too
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:29.280]  right it's it's not going to be in 700 800 900 device for you know forever just the way that
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:34.080]  like a high-end macbook used to cost you know five thousand dollars six thousand dollars yeah
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.960]  routinely spent 2500 i mean i think it's like that was like for a long time that seemed to
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:46.480]  be what i was spending on power books mostly yeah probably back then and i you know again this could
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:51.520]  be like a 10-year thing easily maybe even more again the mac is 30 years old it took a long time
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:56.160]  for the mac to have a laptop that was you know really consumer friendly price but then there's
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:01.280]  so much technology that can still improve battery life can still go you know make a norden you know
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.720]  we you know wouldn't it be nice to have a bad iphone that only need to be charged once a week
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:11.120]  the camera can improve tremendously i mean it's all sorts of things can can improve like that but uh
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.440]  eventually i think it's got to happen all right that our list
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.920]  battery less never going to get better if they keep using 80 cent batteries
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:27.040]  imagine how great your battery iphone battery would be if they put it
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.800]  if they put a five dollar battery in there
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:37.920]  one of those five dollar batteries that you buy buckets of wouldn't that be great
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:44.320]  come on apple uh last thing i can think of is microsoft had a ton of announcements
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.920]  oh yeah that's right that the build build conference uh which i guess is ongoing as we record
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:55.680]  and in typical everybody but apple fashion they spread them out over a couple days
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:02.160]  they're still doing the keynote i think right yeah uh well i think they have like
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:05.680]  but i think started yesterday morning they always had oh see i thought it was two
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.720]  keynotes you're saying it's one you know i think it's this i think it's the same one
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:19.040]  it's the same one uh uh so highlights as they announced a a two initiatives one
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:29.600]  that you can cross compile ios apps for windows 10 um which i think is i think is mainly about games
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  i did i'm not going to say that but their example that was like candy crush saga
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:38.880]  including you know like objective c it's like so it's like a way to write windows apps in objective
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:46.160]  c which is again i'm not a cocoa programmer i never have been but i've you know to go back
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.720]  to like the next era i mean and famously there was a like part of the contention like when next
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.400]  was this is the thing that i thought of with that it's not even about apple but go all the way back
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:02.720]  to next um and again this is all detailed i knew this story but it was detailed in the becoming
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:08.000]  steve jobs next needed productivity apps and they didn't have the big ones and so the ones that they
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:13.120]  did have were all written for next by you know they were like in next little island and there
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.960]  was no microsoft office for next and they needed it for you know whether it was for marketing or
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:26.080]  whether it's for file compatibility and and bill gates's uh quote was developed for it uh piss on
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.800]  it or something like something to that effect something yeah right some kind of bodily function
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:37.040]  bodily function on it on the next computer um he had so little interest in doing it and you know
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:44.880]  and to to think that now in 2015 microsoft is and again it's not quite the same thing as developing
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:51.200]  you know for it although you know also microsoft has an awful lot of ios apps that they make and
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.200]  yeah no they they've done a lot and they're still writing max software and stuff like that
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:01.520]  you know they're a ton a ton ton ton of ios apps so they're real i mean they're much more
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.080]  a cross-platform company yes definitely but it's just crazy to think that they are supporting
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:12.240]  objective c which it was like the nichest of niche app programming languages but the irony
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:16.880]  the irony too that struck me though is that microsoft is get going after mobile developers
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:26.480]  to support objective c exactly when apple is like 10 months into a of long-term push to move
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:32.560]  everybody to a new language swift yeah well i wonder if they had that lying around i don't know
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:37.040]  microsoft just that's the sort of thing we're going to do that now that's the sort of thing
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:41.520]  that they're really really good at i mean it's you know their developer tools team is probably
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:45.760]  the best in the world you know and good compiler engineers and stuff like that and then they're
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:52.320]  also have a android thing but the android thing i think as my understanding again it's been a busy
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:55.600]  couple days but my understanding with android support is that it's more like a runtime
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:03.360]  compatible runtime right right when you say to me runtime compatibility layer on well number one as
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:10.320]  a guy who first and foremost cares about the ui and responsiveness i think gross right but then
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:16.160]  the other thing that occurs to me is in today's world everything i mean what are we using that's
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:21.440]  not plugged in i mean everything is wireless now right even goddamn the new macbook is meant to be
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:27.520]  used without being plugged in you say runtime compatibility layer and i hear battery you can
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:33.440]  just watch here you hear a fan running you could just if you turn on the percentage meter you can
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:43.600]  just watch the the one digit move right 69 68 67 i've got a minute a minute and 20 seconds to play
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:50.000]  this game i i just and i know that again they're good they have really good engineers at microsoft
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:21:00.080]  but it just sounds to me like a terrible idea uh yeah i i i mean it's all yeah i mean they used to
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:05.520]  try and get apple to do that kind of thing too right and it just never seemed like a
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.960]  good idea because what you what you want is people coding directly for your your platform
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:17.120]  instead of oh yeah we'll do you as an afterthought because we already we already coded deliberately
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:24.560]  for somebody else's platform but i mean in terms of like for mobile apps i at this point they'll
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:29.440]  take what they can get i guess well and it also the other thought that popped into my head
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:36.080]  was the same way that sony is making 20 bucks a pop on samsung and iphone uh sales with the
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:41.200]  cameras that microsoft while they're losing money on the windows phones that they're making and
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:45.280]  selling with the nokia thing they bought they're making money on every android phone with all the
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:51.360]  patent licensing deals that they've that they've uh forced you know and according to the law
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:56.640]  rightfully so i mean i you know again we patent show would be you know a whole nother two hours
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:02.640]  but um but they're making a nice little tidy profit every year on on android phones right
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:08.800]  makes you wonder it was like 10 it was like at one point they said like ten dollars a device
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:14.560]  or something crazy like that yeah serious money you know especially given that the the way that
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:24.080]  uh that android is much more about quantity of units rather than quantity of of or you know
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:31.360]  price per unit like apple yeah yeah right like you'd rather have ten dollars per unit on android
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:37.680]  in western countries um than have ten dollars per unit on iphone sales like iphone you'd want like
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:42.080]  a percentage whereas android you want something like that like a ten dollar you know flat fee
[02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:47.120]  could be a lot of money um and i'll tell you what else is looking cool i think that the hololens
[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:51.760]  thing is really starting to look cool the the i thought it looked cool to begin with it's just
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:56.960]  like the only thing is that it's not it's not a real product no and it still has again it's still
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:01.760]  no price no availability date yeah but in the time since but they're showing it the other thing is
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:06.240]  they're showing it again well and it doesn't require the backpack anymore right like when
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:12.560]  they showed it the last time it had like uh some kind of uh not a backpack but you know it had a
[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:17.600]  piece that wasn't just on your head that was connected to it you know and and now it's entirely
[02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:24.320]  on your head like they've made significant gains in terms of you know how practical it would
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:27.760]  actually be again you know who knows what they're even thinking about the price but
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:36.320]  right um and i think it looks really cool and i can totally see uh wanting it to tie this in
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:40.240]  with the beginning of the show my big worry is that this hololens thing is going to be so totally
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:50.480]  cool and is so totally not gonna work with uh with one bum eye i really do i i i was talking to
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:56.000]  another friend who has a not this retina detachment but just a weird eye problem in one eye similar
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.800]  situation to me where it's one eye just it doesn't see so good it may not see so good ever again and
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:07.360]  that we're both uh sort of like been looking forward to like vr our whole lives and might
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:15.680]  be missing out on any prospect of good stereo vr but anyway i think it looks super cool and i have
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:21.200]  to say i to me that is the golden goose in their development pile like there's something there
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:26.080]  that could be a hit product well i really hope it is you know i mean and and like i said i'm glad
[02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:30.160]  that they're showing it again and it wasn't just something that they trotted out to be like hey we
[02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:34.480]  made a big splash and now we're just gonna kind of forget about this thing i mean and even if it's
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.880]  you know well who knows it's like sometimes you make a cool platform and you never know where it's
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:43.680]  going to go right like the iphone people use it you know people use ipads and hospitals and and
[02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:47.760]  universities and it's stuff like that and other people use it to read books and play games and
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:51.680]  whatever like i could see this being that sort of thing where some people buy it so they can play
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.040]  minecraft on their tabletop which really does look cool like the demo that they show it looks amazing
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.200]  i could see it like being an amazing gaming device but i could also see it being used in a
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:05.920]  really serious way like in a factory floor so that you know somebody who's working assembling
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:11.440]  something can get this real-time display and i always see people pop up like how can you
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:18.560]  say that this is cool and you should all over google glass all the time and i it's like i
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:23.840]  can't believe i have to explain it it's like the idea of a heads-up display is an idea and nobody
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:29.680]  has ever said that's a bad idea google glass was not the idea of a heads-up display google glass
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:36.640]  was the exact google glass thing that they made which was ridiculous and stupid right and i just
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.280]  know that these people like when somebody whether it's microsoft with this hololens or somebody else
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:46.640]  who's got a secret thing and somebody's going to make a heads-up display that is cool and people
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:52.000]  say it's cool and these google google fans are going to be like you know calling hypocrisy and
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.360]  it's like no you know it's completely different it's a very different product right criticizing
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:03.040]  a specific product is not criticizing a product category or a general idea like and i think
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.960]  microsoft has done every you know it 12 different things better than google glass like they're not
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:12.560]  making something that they're proposing that you're going to wear all day let's start with
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:18.080]  that yeah right yeah and i've seen people who said well you know you're you know google glass you'd
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:22.320]  wear it why not you know wear it if you know like the factory floor thing well then if that's your
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:27.040]  case if you're working why not make it bigger why just have this little odd thing up in the corner
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:33.680]  why not do like what microsoft is doing and give yourself a big full field of vision yeah you see
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:40.080]  the apps they have too they've they've written it so that um and it's to me this is very i'm not
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.360]  quite sure how this work but their their universal apps work literally on every product they have
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:51.360]  like from a desktop pc to a phone and to this hololens so like if you write like a twitter
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.640]  client you can have like the same twitter client that runs on your phone and runs on your
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:00.720]  on your laptop would also like if you had this hololens on you could project it on your wall
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:05.440]  well you wouldn't project it on your wall you'd see it on the wall or something yeah
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:14.240]  right right it's interesting it's a very it's a sort of xboxy kind of thing yeah like uh like a
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:19.920]  new xbox sort of thing and how they're they seem to be like when they when they started doing the
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:25.680]  xbox they bought bungee and halo was the big centerpiece they're they're not exactly doing
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:31.680]  this with with minecraft but they're definitely you know they're speaking to a whole generation
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:39.520]  of people you know much younger like our kids by plugging that plugging that into this device
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:44.880]  and i think you know i mean like i i haven't even shown my son that yet because he'll he'll
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:53.280]  freak out yeah jonas he'll want one immediately yeah jonas has seen it and it's um it's already
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:58.560]  like on the christmas list and i'm like trying to explain what a prototype is and i'm like remember
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:01.680]  that time i told you about the cars at the car show how they're never going to be so and then
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:04.720]  i don't think you were listening to me and he's like yeah well when's it coming out and i'm like
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:12.320]  i'm telling you i don't know that i don't know and i think growing up in an apple focused household
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:16.160]  has also when you see yeah right when you see something you know it's available right it's
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:20.560]  going to be going to be available shortly right and you know like the longest one in his lifetime
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:28.320]  is the watch and the watch that is shipping now or hopefully you know hopefully shipping uh is a
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:36.800]  pretty much 98.9 what they showed back in september yeah very very very similar yeah
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:42.080]  all right he did he did did he to get he didn't get his yet no he did not know the only one ship
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:46.080]  and as far as i know like i said as far as i can tell on twitter i haven't done deep research but
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:51.120]  as far as i can tell nobody who ordered 38 millimeter space black or space gray whatever
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:56.800]  you call it got one like the ones the gears the 42 has but as far as i can tell 38 millimeter
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.680]  space gray has not shipped interesting and i can definitely well it's good thing i didn't know
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:06.480]  because i almost ordered 38 oh you wouldn't have it good thing i didn't do that i'll say this i
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:11.840]  we should wrap up but i will say this with with uh i have the 42 i've been wearing the 42 um
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:17.920]  and i i asked it you know when for the review unit they asked me which size i wanted um without
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:21.920]  trying it on it was like before i was there for the briefing so i didn't get to i'm sure that if
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.240]  i had said hey this looks ridiculously big can you give me a 38 that they could have accommodated me
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.400]  but and i think i'm happy with the decision and honestly it to tie it all back with the beginning
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:34.960]  of the show part of it is my eyesight and actually you know i find the 38 a little harder to read
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:41.200]  um well that's and that's what i was that's what i was told because i was heavily leaning 38 because
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:46.560]  my wrists are not are not huge and i was really and i've always had smallish i've never had you
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:54.000]  know like not um i've always had smaller sized watches and i didn't want some big clunky thing
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:59.120]  because i had tried on it like a friend of my wife's has a motorola 360 yeah and so i tried on
[02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:04.720]  hers and it was just like oh my god this is ridiculous it's nothing like that it's so huge
[02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:12.080]  yeah and so i was worried about it um but i i'm but i was told like okay battery life might be
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:16.800]  a concern and then also the screen screen size is actually you kind of want something that's a
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:22.800]  little bit larger so uh there's a benefit to it anyway and so i went 42 and i'm quite happy with
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:27.200]  what i got but i tried amy's 38 millimeter with the milanese on and it looked perfect on my wrist
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:32.320]  looked just fine did not look dainty didn't look the least bit feminine or whatever and i've met
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:35.840]  well that's the thing it's not i mean they're the same damn watch i mean you know other than the
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:41.520]  size there's it's like it's not like one doesn't have flowers all over there so yeah well but
[02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:46.800]  there's also a different size it could be too small though it really could uh you know i wrote
[02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:51.600]  about it i suppose yeah i suppose but if you have really small wrists i don't think i mean there's
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:55.440]  no i don't think there's a real i don't think there's a real problem getting the 38 but yeah
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:31:00.640]  i was perfectly happy with the 42 yeah i think 38 is like a regular man-sized watch you know
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:05.120]  it in an not in the modern world where these watches are really big but like going back a
[02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:09.920]  long time and that on most women it's going to look like a large woman's watch it's a regular
[02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:17.760]  man's watch or a large woman's watch and 42 is sort of a slightly large men's watch yeah yeah
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:23.280]  but did you see you know mike rundle he's like a designer type guy on twitter but he had a post on
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:27.520]  medium where he complained that it's way too small like that's how small the 42 millimeter
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:31.840]  apple watches is that there's some people with good taste you know but and who are used to the
[02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:37.040]  the current watch market who who seriously and i think correctly argue that it's too small
[02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:43.760]  yeah some people some people really do like large watches right yeah i honestly i don't no i don't
[02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:47.200]  either i think it's a weird trend i don't really you know same way i don't like the large phones
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:52.960]  but yeah right i don't like but there's nobody nobody is arguing about the any other smart
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:32:00.320]  watch on the market to date that it's too small no i don't think there's any way all right john
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:08.000]  moltz people can get all the moltz they want uh at very nice website dot net yeah uh they can
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:15.040]  listen to the dulcet tones of your voice on how many podcasts now oh my god three now all right
