[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  And did you actually need the eye patch or was that just for, you know, if you wanted to look like we'll film.
[00:05.520 --> 00:13.200]  I needed it. Not like because it was like a gross hole in my eye that needed to be covered up,
[00:13.200 --> 00:17.200]  although it was kind of red, but it was never like gross to look at. So it wasn't cosmetic,
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.560]  and it wasn't for the cool look. I needed it because the vision out of that eye was so weird
[00:24.560 --> 00:32.800]  that there was no other way that I could see like to read or watch TV because my brain couldn't
[00:32.800 --> 00:39.840]  process. Yeah, too disruptive. It was way too disruptive. So I used an eye patch for at least a month
[00:39.840 --> 00:44.560]  for stuff like reading and watching TV. And then I started by like not using it for TV.
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.720]  And now I don't use it for anything, but it's weird though, like if I close my good,
[00:50.720 --> 00:57.280]  I can't read my computer at all, but that's partly because of the eye is just not good, but it's
[00:57.280 --> 01:02.480]  also the case that my prescription is no longer valid. So I actually, I'm going to point on going
[01:02.480 --> 01:09.120]  soon to get a new prescription for the bad eye. But right now, like as we record the show, I'm wearing
[01:09.120 --> 01:23.280]  my glasses and the lens in my glasses is, I mean, is this interesting? I don't even know. Is this
[01:23.280 --> 01:29.200]  interesting? It's it's fascinating. I think I mean, I mean, we can talk about baseball
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.200]  for our kids long story short really what started the whole saga for me was that last year the
[01:37.200 --> 01:42.720]  vision of my left eye started getting, I thought blurry. And I just thought it meant that I needed
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.920]  a new prescription. And I was also having trouble reading with my left eye, which I attributed to
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.960]  being 41. And I thought, well, I'm getting pressed by opia. I need, you know, reading glasses,
[01:52.960 --> 01:58.960]  but only for my left eye. And I talked to my regular optometrist. And that just was that you really
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.640]  can't go for like bifocals or whatever, you know, you want to call them until both eyes need them.
[02:04.640 --> 02:08.480]  That your brain doesn't really process it right. If one eye doesn't in my right, I still didn't.
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.960]  So he said, really, you know, it's I know it's a pain, but you know, this is getting older,
[02:12.960 --> 02:16.880]  it's you'd be better off just reading with, you know, letting your right eye dominate as you read.
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.000]  And so I did. And then for distance viewing, I got a new prescription and it was a lot stronger.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.760]  And for years and years and years, I mean, like really, I mean, honestly, since I started wearing
[02:25.760 --> 02:30.800]  glasses, my left and right eyes had more or less the same prescription. Like usually my right eye
[02:30.800 --> 02:37.680]  was a little bit better, meaning it didn't need quite a stronger prescription. But for most of my
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.840]  thirties, they were identical. And I, you know, like when I wore contact lenses, I didn't even
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.160]  have to keep track of left and right. I had the exact same lens for both eyes. Yeah, that's good.
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.200]  So then that's, that's the sweet spot. Well, those were the golden years. Yeah, I used to
[02:51.200 --> 02:57.120]  had that for a while, but not anymore. Me being able to see. So last year, my left eye
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.360]  prescription got a lot stronger. And my right eye actually even got better. He's, you know,
[03:01.360 --> 03:04.960]  he said, that sometimes happens when you get to be 40. So I actually got a new prescription
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.680]  where the lens in my right eye was actually a weaker prescription than what I'd been using,
[03:09.680 --> 03:16.960]  but the left eye got stronger. And then the months went on. And I realized, you know, it's just a
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.320]  few months after having been to him and being kind of pleased with the, you know, corrected vision,
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.600]  um, that by December, my left eye was on everything was blurry again. Distance was blurry,
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.440]  close up was blurry. It just wasn't good. Um, and so it just seemed like a mystery and nobody couldn't
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.080]  figure it out. Like even making it, I got a new stronger prescription. And it was really strong,
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.720]  like worry seemingly strong because it had gotten so much worse since July. Um, and turns out,
[03:44.720 --> 03:49.440]  uh, I had a cataract, which was really hard to diagnose because I couldn't really see it.
[03:49.440 --> 03:56.480]  Um, and 41 is super crazy, duper young to have a cataract. So it wasn't even on the list of
[03:56.480 --> 04:02.880]  things that they suspected. Um, but like Indiana Jones, it's not the years is the mileage.
[04:02.880 --> 04:10.400]  Exactly. Uh, my right eye has no signs of a cataract, uh, which is also most people don't get
[04:10.400 --> 04:16.400]  cataracts until they're in their 60s or 70s and like 55 is considered young for cataracts. Um,
[04:16.400 --> 04:22.960]  but the younger you are when you get a cataract, the faster it worsens, which so being super
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.480]  crazy young 41 to have a cataract, which is why like my vision went from this kind of, it's
[04:28.480 --> 04:33.520]  a little, maybe I need a new glasses to wow, I don't see so good in the course of a year. Um,
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.640]  cataract surgery is routine. It is like going to the dentist, supposedly, although it's terrifying to me.
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.240]  Um, and the retina detachment was, it wasn't like a botched surgery or something like that. It
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.480]  happened like a week later, but it's like a one in a thousand complication from any sort of
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.080]  eye surgery that wants anything goes in because cataract stuff is all at the front of your eye.
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.480]  It's stuff at the lens in the very front and a retina, obviously is all the way in the back.
[04:56.480 --> 05:00.800]  But anytime anything gets switched around in there, there's a small chance that a little bit of
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.680]  the fluid and get behind a retina and then it makes it come off the eye. So I had it.
[05:06.480 --> 05:10.720]  The stuff that they do with eyes just seems insane to me. Yeah, it's crazy. It seems like to me
[05:10.720 --> 05:15.120]  you have to be a psychopath to like, I think all surgeons sort of have to be a little bit like a
[05:15.120 --> 05:19.600]  psychopath, like a little bit to sort of, I do. I mean it, you have to be a little bit detached
[05:19.600 --> 05:26.800]  from humanity to, to, to, to, to, to have that to not be repulsed by the idea of cutting open
[05:26.800 --> 05:30.880]  somebody, even though you know, you know, you have to have this rigorous logical mind where you know
[05:30.880 --> 05:36.320]  you're doing good for the person by doing this thing that your instincts tell you is, is not good.
[05:36.320 --> 05:41.040]  Yeah. So anyway, that's, you know, for people who've been wondering how in the world I had the
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.560]  retina detachment, it was, I had cataract surgery, which it was in fact successful, like the lens
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.640]  implant they put into replace the cloudy cataract lens is in perfect shape. It's just that like
[05:52.640 --> 06:00.000]  1,000 or 1 and 500 or, you know, some really, really 99% small number of people who have cataract
[06:00.000 --> 06:06.160]  surgery then have a retina detachment and it turns out I was one of them. So anyway, that is
[06:06.160 --> 06:11.840]  also why my glasses from my left eye are so weird because they were really, really strong because
[06:11.840 --> 06:17.520]  at the time we were trying to, you know, counteract the cataract. So anyway, I don't see, I don't
[06:17.520 --> 06:23.040]  really see so good at a left eye. But I've been, I've been nearsighted since grade school basically
[06:23.040 --> 06:29.840]  and then now, now in the last like five years, I've started to lose that too. So, so not only am I
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.160]  gonna need, I mean, you know, I was pretty soon probably need to have some sort of, I don't know
[06:34.160 --> 06:36.880]  what I mean. I mean, I don't know if they make bifocal contact lenses.
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.920]  They do. I think they do. They don't work so good. But they're kind of weird. Yeah. Yeah. So I
[06:43.920 --> 06:47.920]  guess I'll just have reading classes. Yeah. And you do weird things. They do weird things where they
[06:47.920 --> 06:52.080]  they will give you like two different contacts, one for each eye and let one eye be kind of,
[06:52.080 --> 06:56.880]  one eye see close on one eye see fall. And you leave the office and you think, oh, this is never
[06:56.880 --> 07:02.400]  gonna work. This is horrible. But if you give it a week, your brain kind of kicks in. But it's like,
[07:02.400 --> 07:06.080]  the long story short is that nothing, once you get into this ended, you know, forget the
[07:06.080 --> 07:09.360]  retina detachment. But once you're in that situation where you're doing stuff like that,
[07:09.360 --> 07:15.120]  you just never just see like you used to do like, no, even though I've been here
[07:15.120 --> 07:20.720]  days or over, even though I've been nearsighted since teenage years too, with contacts,
[07:20.720 --> 07:26.640]  to me contact lenses were magical up until I was 41 years old where I would, I never had any
[07:26.640 --> 07:32.240]  discomfort with them. I always found them to be like, you spend 30 seconds in the morning and
[07:32.240 --> 07:36.400]  30 seconds at night. And all of a sudden, your eyes are just perfect. And I could see everything
[07:36.400 --> 07:40.160]  close and everything far. And it was like, I had 2020 decision and both eyes.
[07:40.800 --> 07:47.920]  But they didn't, but they didn't used to be so good until they came up with disposable ones
[07:47.920 --> 07:53.760]  before that. I had originally had hard contact lenses, which were a goddamn nightmare. And then
[07:53.760 --> 07:57.760]  after that, they, they, you know, they came up with the plastic with the saw plastic ones.
[07:57.760 --> 08:02.880]  Uh, but you were supposed to just like, you got one pair. Yeah, you were supposed to keep them and
[08:02.880 --> 08:09.360]  you were supposed to do this like crazy complicated maintenance stuff with it. And then never,
[08:09.360 --> 08:15.520]  it never, they never got completely clean. And I was always getting like eye infections and my eye
[08:15.520 --> 08:20.880]  was, but when I had hard lenses, I, my, when I was just watering all the time. So I, I would do
[08:20.880 --> 08:24.320]  that thing where I would just like, I would take one out. And so I would walk around. I would spend
[08:24.320 --> 08:28.960]  most of my day with just one contact lenses. Uh, see, see really well out of one eye and like crap
[08:28.960 --> 08:33.440]  out of the other one. Yeah, that's probably like you being just ever so slightly older than me
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.920]  because I missed the hard ones. But when I first started wearing them as a teenager, I believe I
[08:37.920 --> 08:43.520]  stepped a worm for like six months at a time. Something like that. And at the end of the cycle,
[08:43.520 --> 08:49.200]  then I should say it was a little, a little bit uncomfortable. Yeah. But anyway, it's, you know,
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.720]  it, it, it, it, all the other thing too about the retina detachment is it seems to be like a serious,
[08:54.720 --> 09:01.120]  it's a sports injury. Like it takes, it literally takes like six months to a year to completely
[09:01.120 --> 09:09.280]  recover. And it's only been, no, I'm going to say two months for me. Um, and it is getting better.
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.240]  It's, you know, it definitely is improving, but it's like very, very slow and gradual.
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.240]  We should start a pool on what, uh, what's going to happen to you next year, because you've had
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.680]  your, you've had your thumb. And now your eye was my, it wasn't my thumb. It was my middle finger.
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.400]  Was your thumb? No, it was my middle finger. What was your middle finger? Yeah. Really? Oh,
[09:30.400 --> 09:33.840]  I thought it was your thumb. Maybe it was just because the bandage was, yeah, maybe brace,
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.040]  the brace, I mean, it looked like it was your thumb. Yeah, because like my thumb was sticking up.
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.840]  I thought you were like, like they had taken your thumbs, like someone had a,
[09:39.840 --> 09:49.520]  ready to cut your thumbs off. Yeah. No, I had a bad winner really did. So also, I'll talk to
[09:49.520 --> 09:56.240]  Kefasas. We'll see what we'll get a pool going. Yeah. Um, it's got to be something, right? Yeah.
[09:56.240 --> 10:00.640]  I, you know, I went to a doctor though and I had like a full checkup because I thought, you know,
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.680]  this is, um, actually, I think I had to because I think they weren't going to do this,
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.120]  there was some kind of surgery I was going to have where they said they, I needed it.
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.920]  Um, but I've, you know, like I got my heart checked in everything. So it looks like I'm cutting
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.480]  everything. I was all, I had such a bad run. I was like, uh, a better than I have a heart attack too.
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.160]  Well, now you have the watch. I'll keep, uh, yeah, keep, keep track of your heart for you. Yeah.
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.120]  Yeah. It's weird. It's hard to, for me to explain. People ask about my eye and I know that
[10:31.120 --> 10:36.160]  they mean well, and I don't want to bring everybody down and complain. Um, but it is,
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.400]  it just requires a long explanation. And the problems with my vision are actually very hard to
[10:40.400 --> 10:43.600]  explain too because I've always just assumed that when you have bad vision, everything is either
[10:43.600 --> 10:50.240]  cloudy or not cloudy or blurry or not blurry. Um, and it's not blurring this. It's, it's like,
[10:51.600 --> 10:57.680]  it's so hard to explain that division out of my left eye is like, distorted is the word, but
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.440]  the way it's disordered is sort of like, um,
[11:01.440 --> 11:07.680]  uh, I need, I need corrective lenses to help focus to get the picture, right? But like, if I take
[11:07.680 --> 11:11.760]  my glasses off, I have no lens on the wrong. I can see at a certain close distance because I'm
[11:11.760 --> 11:19.520]  nearsighted, I can see in focus. But the image is distorted in weird ways. Like the best I can,
[11:19.520 --> 11:24.800]  the best analogy I can think of is think of a movie projector that's in focus, but it's projecting
[11:24.800 --> 11:34.000]  onto a stucco wall. Oh, yeah. Uh, like a really stucco-y stucco wall. So like, you know,
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.720]  circles don't look perfectly round there. They look like hand drawn like by somebody with like a
[11:38.720 --> 11:44.400]  very sharp pen, like a scratchy pen. There's like, there's an image editing filter like that.
[11:44.400 --> 11:48.400]  Right. I mean, there's some, there's some like in Photoshop and a pixel meter. There's like some
[11:48.400 --> 11:54.240]  thing where you can do to, yeah, like almost like stained glass or something. Yeah. Um, you know,
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.360]  and, but it's, you know, it is definitely improving, but it is improving at such a very slow pace
[11:59.360 --> 12:05.040]  that it's, it's hard to tell on a day-to-day basis. You know, it's like, I imagine that it's sort of like
[12:05.040 --> 12:12.080]  if you have like, um, like Adam, um, as Adam rain, rain, right? The picture, the, the one guy for
[12:12.080 --> 12:18.880]  the St. Louis Cardinals, Wayne Wright had a, it tore as Achilles tendon in his ankle the other day,
[12:18.880 --> 12:24.080]  which is terrible injury, terrible, terrible injury. So as Achilles is torn, um, like a full
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.560]  year to recover. I'm sure that, you know, he's probably already had the surgery and it's like,
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.400]  I'm sure like two months from now, he's still going to be 10 months away from being recovered.
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.280]  So, you know, his ankle's still going to feel like shit and then like a week later, it's going to,
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.160]  it's going to be improved, but it's still going to feel like shit. You know, and I feel like
[12:42.160 --> 12:47.280]  that's what my vision is like at this point. But also though, like if you have an Achilles tendon,
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.760]  you know, he's going to, he's expected to be able to pitch again. Like the, the unfortunate truth,
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.040]  I don't want to bring everybody down, but the unfortunate truth is I'm never really going to see
[12:55.040 --> 13:03.760]  right out of my left eye again. But on the other hand, on the other hand, I am right eye dominant.
[13:03.760 --> 13:08.400]  I do, I, I, I wasn't going to talk about this, but it's funny because I do, but I do have,
[13:08.400 --> 13:12.720]  ever since I brought it up and made it public at all, I've been inundated with emails and stuff
[13:12.720 --> 13:17.280]  like that from readers and listeners who are all of them very, very genuinely concerned and
[13:17.280 --> 13:25.520]  wishing me the best. In the grand scheme of having serious vision issues, I'm incredibly lucky
[13:25.520 --> 13:34.080]  because I'm right eye dominant and my right eye is still 2020 with corrected vision and shows no
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.080]  sign of cataract. They're, they're best explanation for why I got a cataract so young. It's probably
[13:38.080 --> 13:41.520]  that I had some kind of injury could have, they said it could have even been like as a teenager,
[13:41.520 --> 13:47.040]  like playing basketball or something, some kind of trauma that damaged the tissue around the lens
[13:47.040 --> 13:51.280]  and it just, you know, takes a long time. But the fact that I was so young means it probably
[13:51.280 --> 13:58.160]  wasn't like age related. And so it's, you know, very unlikely. Even if I do eventually get a
[13:58.160 --> 14:04.800]  cataract and right eye, you know, I can go to a specialist, you know, who would be like super
[14:04.800 --> 14:10.640]  duper extra careful with the cataract surgery, knowing that I have a, you know, obviously have some
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.440]  kind of tendency to threaten the issue. And there's no reason to expect that I would, you know,
[14:15.440 --> 14:23.120]  suffer another 99.9% chance of success, you know, that I'd be on the wrong side of that again.
[14:23.120 --> 14:27.840]  So, you know, and so being 2020 and of dominant eye, it's funny, because that's the other
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.720]  thing too about my vision as I recover from the thing like two months later, my brain is clearly
[14:32.720 --> 14:44.160]  getting way, way better at, um, um, just sort of ignoring Mr. Left eye. You know what I mean? Like
[14:44.160 --> 14:50.960]  he's like, you know, it's no longer, he's no longer part of the team. Yeah, it's like, they're,
[14:50.960 --> 14:57.840]  well, no, he is, but it's like, it's okay that he's not so not really contributing so much,
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.240]  you know, I'll tell you, it was weird. See, that's the thing though, it's like,
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.080]  and it is a sign that I'm getting better. And it's a combination of the eye getting better.
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.520]  And, and again, my surgeon, I was just there like a week and a half ago or two weeks for like,
[15:11.520 --> 15:18.320]  if I, we follow up and he said he was very pleased. And he's, he's been sort of a, he's great.
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.960]  He's, I think, literally like maybe one of the best retina surgeons in the world. Um, uh,
[15:26.880 --> 15:30.880]  so I'm super lucky to have him, but he's also very, very clinical. Like he's, you know,
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.440]  like before I even went into surgery, he was like, he's like, you know, your division's
[15:35.440 --> 15:41.680]  and we're going to be the same again. He's been very, very, he's like set realistic, very
[15:41.680 --> 15:47.040]  under-promised over, over-deliver sort of doctor all along. And he said he's very, very pleased
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.600]  with, you know, what I were aware of. Well, that's what you want to do. I mean, you want to go in
[15:51.600 --> 15:57.360]  like telling people, they'll be, they'll be good as new and, uh, and then they come out
[15:57.360 --> 16:01.520]  that are not. Yeah. If you come out and it's better than you expected, that's great, but if it's
[16:01.520 --> 16:07.520]  worse, then that's not there. But it's been weird. Uh, like I said, it's a relatively slow
[16:07.520 --> 16:13.360]  pace of improvement, but it's still only been eight weeks. And it's been this weird graph of like,
[16:13.360 --> 16:20.400]  what's better, just keeping the eye patch over the left eye and just being one eye with a 2020
[16:20.400 --> 16:26.720]  eye, or trying to make the best out of this mixed picture. And it's been weird because at first,
[16:26.720 --> 16:30.400]  I use using the eye patch for almost everything. I even took it, you know, like when I went to
[16:30.400 --> 16:34.880]  the supermarket and stuff, um, because it was just the vision out of the left eye was just,
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.360]  it was just not, it was, you know, the gas bubble made it, you know, just made it completely
[16:39.360 --> 16:44.000]  useless. I mean, it was effectively blind, you know, it's like when you, you, you finally understood
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.280]  what it meant to be where you're not blind, like everything lets black, you see color and stuff
[16:49.280 --> 16:55.280]  like that, but it's completely and utterly useless at any distance. Um, but having that being
[16:55.280 --> 16:59.520]  monocular, only having one eye that you know, everybody knows that you don't have any depth
[16:59.520 --> 17:06.560]  perception with both without both eyes. Um, but like experiencing it all day, it was crazy.
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.520]  Like I would just bump into things. It was, I had to be like super, it really turned me into like
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.600]  an old man because I had to be like super careful. Every time I put a glass down on a table,
[17:15.600 --> 17:22.720]  stuff like that, I was constantly spilling stuff. I would go, um, and take like a picture of orange
[17:22.720 --> 17:27.120]  juice and try to pour myself orange juice. And I, if I wasn't completely concentrating on it, boom,
[17:27.120 --> 17:33.520]  it's just splashed all over the counter. And I'd be like, oh, it's crazy. And it's gotten better
[17:33.520 --> 17:37.840]  than like now I don't, I don't wear the iPad for anything even though the left eye isn't like
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.200]  helping me read. But even though even though the vision is bad, your depth perception is okay.
[17:43.200 --> 17:47.040]  Yeah, that's the thing is that having the left eye contribute, the left eye is absolute,
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.800]  so it is, so it's doing something. Yeah. Yeah. Like, and I can do things like if I throw something
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.280]  up in the air, you know, I can catch it and stuff. I can see like, I can get that sort of depth
[17:57.280 --> 18:07.360]  perception. So your juggling career is not over. No, baby using chainsaws back at it.
[18:07.920 --> 18:12.160]  Good thing there's nothing going on in the world of stuff we usually talk about.
[18:12.160 --> 18:15.520]  I guess this is better than having you on and talking about baseball. Yeah, right.
[18:15.520 --> 18:18.560]  Nobody likes hearing us talk about baseball. But anyway, everybody out there has been
[18:18.560 --> 18:22.880]  which many good thoughts. Thank you. Thank you so much. I really do appreciate it. I don't mean to
[18:22.880 --> 18:28.320]  be too down about it. You know, it's, it's, you know, it's not a good situation, but it could be so
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.760]  much worse. And I really do still have tremendously good vision out of my dominant eye. So it's
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.080]  all things considered. It's not bad. And it is getting better. It's good. At this point,
[18:38.080 --> 18:41.040]  as of this week, and this is sort of new, it'll be the last thing I say about it,
[18:41.040 --> 18:51.200]  it's the effect of my combined both eyes open vision is sort of as though there's like
[18:52.640 --> 18:58.080]  like vapors in the air, like maybe like what it would look like. Maybe not what it would look
[18:58.080 --> 19:02.400]  like in real life, because I guess like, you know, like when you have like a gas oven and you know,
[19:02.400 --> 19:07.600]  it's like what what it would look like in a cartoon if there was a gas leak, right?
[19:07.600 --> 19:13.040]  Like everything is clear, and I can see stuff. But it just looks like if I'm, if I was within
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.360]  like three feet of you, it would just look to me like there were, it looks to me like there's just
[19:17.360 --> 19:22.880]  a little bit of waviness in the air between us. Like you, you look normal, but it looks like
[19:22.880 --> 19:32.400]  there's wavy vapors in the air. Living in the desert. Yeah. Well, on that up note, why don't I
[19:32.400 --> 19:40.720]  thank our first sponsor? Well, let's do fracture are good friends at fracture. You guys know
[19:40.720 --> 19:47.120]  fracture. They're the outfit where they take your photos, you send them photos, and they print
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.960]  them directly on glass. Well, Mother's Day is coming up right now. Listen to me right now.
[19:52.960 --> 19:58.320]  Listen to the show as it comes out. You'll have time to get your order in. Go there. Your mom is
[19:58.320 --> 20:04.080]  going to love this, your wife, any of the mothers in your life. What more would they like to see
[20:04.080 --> 20:09.600]  then loved ones, family members on really nice pictures? This is like the surest thing,
[20:09.600 --> 20:17.040]  sponsorship of the, of the year. Get anybody who you need to get from other state. Go to
[20:17.040 --> 20:26.240]  fractureme.com, get some pictures of the dog, the kids, you, your family, them, anybody who
[20:26.240 --> 20:31.440]  you're family would like, you know, anybody in your family, print them out. Trust me, this is a great
[20:31.440 --> 20:38.560]  gift. I've already ordered some. I know from last year, it goes over great. It is a just, it's a
[20:38.560 --> 20:44.320]  surefire, can't miss Mother's Day gift. They have all sorts of sizes. They have little ones, big ones.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.520]  And it's just a tremendous, tremendous product. It's a really cool thing. And obviously, if it's
[20:51.520 --> 20:56.160]  like a gift, it's the most important thing is what the picture is of. But I'm telling you firsthand,
[20:56.160 --> 21:04.000]  I know from having given these to my mom, to Amy's mom, that it's also a talking point where they
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.920]  see it. They thank you. They love the picture. And then they immediately ask, wait, how did you make
[21:07.920 --> 21:12.160]  this? This is amazing because even people who aren't geeks or nerds, they look at these things.
[21:12.160 --> 21:16.320]  And they're like, you could just tell this is not like a regular printed photo. What fracture
[21:16.320 --> 21:22.320]  does is they print the photos directly on the glass. It's right there. It looks like it's right
[21:22.320 --> 21:28.160]  on the surface of the glass like a retina screen. There's no frame around it. You can just hang
[21:28.160 --> 21:35.760]  it right on the wall as an edge to edge, no bezel thing that just hangs there. The packaging comes
[21:35.760 --> 21:42.320]  with everything you need to put a thing on the back. So you can hang it on the wall to prop it up
[21:42.320 --> 21:46.400]  like an easel if it's something that goes on a mantle or a desk or something like that depending
[21:46.400 --> 21:52.640]  on the size. It's all there right there in the packaging. The quality is just can't be beat.
[21:54.480 --> 21:58.960]  And it's just a really, really nice thing. So where do you go to find out more? Go to their website,
[21:58.960 --> 22:07.360]  it's fractureme.com, fractureme.com, and use the code Daring Fireball. All one word, Daring Fireball,
[22:07.360 --> 22:13.920]  and you'll save 15% off their already excellent prices. So my thanks to fracture, go there
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.520]  right now, pause the podcast and get your mom a gift or your wife or whoever you need to get
[22:19.520 --> 22:27.120]  for Mother's Day. Not a bad idea. No. I might do that myself. Now, may I wait till Sunday morning?
[22:27.120 --> 22:43.760]  I'm laughing. What's open? I got your breakfast. I mean, what do you say we start going to
[22:43.760 --> 22:51.200]  church? It got us in. Good seats too. Yeah. Right next to God.
[22:51.200 --> 23:02.720]  I even buttered it for you. Don't get up. Oh, man. So what's going on this week?
[23:04.720 --> 23:13.040]  Well, I just got my watch yesterday. So that's interesting. I feel like right now the topic
[23:13.040 --> 23:16.320]  du jour isn't really the watch itself, but it's almost like when people are getting them and
[23:16.320 --> 23:22.320]  when they were promised them. Yeah. So mine came, well, you know, early, but I mean, my wife ordered
[23:22.320 --> 23:29.760]  it for me because I was at fifth grade camp with my son. So, which is a whole other story, but
[23:30.400 --> 23:34.320]  she ordered it for me and she ordered it like seriously like four minutes after 12
[23:34.320 --> 23:46.240]  is when she pushed the button and my date, my initial date range was between May 13th and the 24th
[23:48.000 --> 23:55.040]  based on that purchase time, which to me seems ludicrous. But that's, I guess that was what
[23:55.840 --> 24:02.640]  the level of availability was, particularly for the, so I got the space gray sport one, which I
[24:02.640 --> 24:11.600]  think was a fairly heavily purchased. And it was, um, 42, 42. All right. So we, I clearly,
[24:12.400 --> 24:17.680]  again, Apple isn't talking about this and they never will, but it seems very clear by looking at
[24:17.680 --> 24:23.120]  like Twitter and any kind of forum or like Mac rumors or whatever people are talking about this,
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.520]  that there's a definite pattern to which watch you ordered, which strap it has and which ones
[24:29.520 --> 24:37.440]  are being made and shipping out. Um, so we did, we bought three, one frame, he won for me, one for
[24:37.440 --> 24:42.560]  Jonas, um, you know, which I, you know, which again, it's ridiculous buying your kid in fifth grade,
[24:42.560 --> 24:46.800]  it's goddamn Apple watch, but he's a good kid and he, you know, hasn't gotten anything new in
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.800]  a while and it, I write it off to, you know, a work expense because I'm fascinated by the fact that
[24:52.800 --> 25:02.960]  he's fascinated by it. Um, so I ordered the, the expensive black link bracelet one, the space
[25:02.960 --> 25:13.760]  black. Oh, it's the space. Oh, are you okay? Okay. Um, Amy got 38 millimeter millinis and the one
[25:13.760 --> 25:19.040]  for Jonas is the 38 millimeter space black. As far as I can to, and we ordered them boom, boom,
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.680]  boom. For us, it was 3 a.m., but it was right when the store went live and we used the iPhone app.
[25:25.680 --> 25:31.040]  Um, people who are smart, really smart way to you. If you really thought that it made a difference
[25:31.040 --> 25:36.480]  to be like at like 30 seconds instead of a minute in the smartest way to do it, which I wasn't smart enough
[25:36.480 --> 25:42.480]  to do was to save a favorite and you were like three, it was like three taps. It was like three
[25:42.480 --> 25:50.160]  taps and a, uh, and a, what's it called touch ID and you're, you're done. For me, it was, you know,
[25:50.160 --> 25:58.320]  it was like four taps. It was like, I want this. Um, so I greedily ordered my own first. So my,
[25:58.960 --> 26:05.360]  mine was ordered at like one minute in within 45 seconds. Then I ordered Amy's and then I got
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.960]  Jonas's, but all three orders were placed within three minutes. It was like 303 and all three orders
[26:10.960 --> 26:19.120]  were in. And I also got myself a sport, don't ban the black sport band 42 millimeters and Amy
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.960]  wanted a black sport band 38 millimeters. Um, so I got those two and that I think those orders
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.960]  were placed, you know, I don't know. But within five minutes, I was done with all of it, but I
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.240]  ordered those bands separately. The only thing that shipped for it to us so far is Amy's 38 millimeter
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.480]  millenies. None of the individual, I thought the bands would just come, you know, because that
[26:38.480 --> 26:43.360]  seems like the tease, right? You know, yeah, right. You get the bands first and then, uh-huh,
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.600]  you didn't get your friend. And I know that people definitely got the chargers first. People who
[26:47.600 --> 26:53.120]  ordered a second charger definitely got them like, yeah, I saw those on Twitter. Because that's
[26:53.120 --> 26:56.800]  what torments people. And again, it's easy for me to say that it's tormenting because I've got
[26:56.800 --> 27:03.680]  the review unit from Apple. So it's not like I'm watchless. Um, but it seems like it as a basic rule,
[27:03.680 --> 27:09.280]  the black sport band is somehow in low production across the board, whether you bought standalone
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.400]  bands or whether you bought a watch with a black band. And that's interesting. And I, you know,
[27:14.400 --> 27:20.000]  obviously, it in yours is black, right? But yours didn't ship yet, right? No, I got it. I mean,
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.520]  I got it yesterday. So it came, I came a lot earlier than they said it was going to come came
[27:23.520 --> 27:30.480]  well, at least two weeks earlier. And, but, um, but, you know, I didn't, I did not get it,
[27:30.480 --> 27:35.120]  I didn't get until five days after they were supposed to be delivered. Yeah. And I saw somebody else,
[27:35.120 --> 27:40.320]  I saw a couple people on Twitter who got steel, the steel watch, but with the black band built,
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.080]  you know, like as the built-in configuration, who got theirs like yesterday or today. Um, and it
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.200]  seems like they were this exact same boat as you where they were promised, you know, like May 13th
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.960]  or something like that. And here it is and came, but no word on any of our other ones. I think I
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.520]  checked earlier today, but no, none, you know, but it seems as though it isn't even, it's hardly
[28:01.520 --> 28:07.840]  even worth checking because it's like, by the time the status changes on the order, it's like on a
[28:07.840 --> 28:13.200]  truck from FedEx. Yeah. Yeah. And your doorbell. That's about what happened to me. I think I got,
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.760]  I got an email before I was checking, I was checking fairly regularly, but I got an email
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.480]  before I noticed it on the website. Notice that it changed on the website. Yeah. And it said,
[28:24.480 --> 28:35.520]  it would be here the next day. Yeah. Um, for Amy's, it was, um, because I've got my MX on Apple Pay,
[28:35.520 --> 28:40.080]  and I'm not really a notification. We can even talk about like how many notifications you get
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.400]  and for what, you know, and I feel like the watch is really making people think about what
[28:45.040 --> 28:53.120]  notifications they get for what. Um, but one of my favorite features is if you have your MX in Apple
[28:53.120 --> 28:59.600]  Pay on your phone, every time your MX gets charged, you get a notification telling you who charged
[28:59.600 --> 29:08.240]  it and for how much. And I don't know why, but I really enjoy that. You know, and 99% of the time,
[29:08.240 --> 29:14.640]  it's like 10 seconds after I just charged something. Um, but I kind of find it like reassuring,
[29:14.640 --> 29:20.800]  like, uh, I don't know. It's like, I don't know that I've ever been ripped off at a restaurant
[29:20.800 --> 29:29.280]  where I've signed a bill for, you know, $87. Um, and been charged more than that, you know,
[29:29.280 --> 29:32.960]  because you just hand it, you know, yeah, it's put a tip down and you hand it and you go like,
[29:32.960 --> 29:37.840]  and I never like go back at the end of the month and look at my bill. Yeah, I used to do that.
[29:37.840 --> 29:42.240]  I don't do that anymore. All right. He came to, it just became too much to do and I was never
[29:42.240 --> 29:47.120]  finding anything. Right. But I love the fact that like, I'll go outside and, you know, maybe we're
[29:47.120 --> 29:51.520]  walking home and then I get a buzz and I look down and it says, you know, that the restaurant just
[29:51.520 --> 29:55.680]  charged me $87 and it's fresh in my head because I just signed the bill and I know that that's
[29:55.680 --> 30:02.240]  right. We know exactly what it should be. Um, and with Amy's watch, it was like, I got, it was like
[30:02.240 --> 30:05.440]  late at night. It was like, I don't know, like 11 o'clock at night and it was like, you've been
[30:05.440 --> 30:11.840]  billed $600 and it's like the next morning at like 10 o'clock ding dong. There it is. So I guess
[30:11.840 --> 30:16.240]  I don't really have to check. I guess I'll just get the amex alert, you know, when, when the next
[30:16.240 --> 30:22.080]  watch ships. But it does seem like, it seems like, I mean, I guess there's some people who,
[30:22.080 --> 30:27.600]  who haven't gotten theirs at the beginning of their promised window. But as far as I can tell,
[30:27.600 --> 30:35.680]  nobody has missed their promised window. Uh, well, what about those ones that the developer
[30:35.680 --> 30:41.040]  ones weren't the developer ones? That's a weird. Yeah, I thought it, yeah, that was kind of weird
[30:41.040 --> 30:46.160]  to begin with. But I thought I saw some of them say that they had not gotten them despite
[30:46.160 --> 30:52.320]  ordering them. But did they get them yesterday? I don't know. As I don't remember who, I don't
[30:52.320 --> 30:57.520]  remember who it was. Whiskus ordered one of those and I could remember what they, what the promise
[30:57.520 --> 31:02.720]  was. The promise was promised delivery by the 28th or promise shipping by the 28th. But Whiskus didn't
[31:02.720 --> 31:08.720]  get his on the 28th, but he did get it on the 29th. Okay. Okay. I don't know if there's anybody
[31:08.720 --> 31:13.360]  that was, maybe that was the difference. But it's the whole story of those watches seems crazy though
[31:13.360 --> 31:18.320]  because they're obviously so resource constrained. And after they knew that they, you know,
[31:18.320 --> 31:24.560]  that they were so constrained on these, was when they made the offer and it included like I think
[31:24.560 --> 31:29.520]  that they, I don't know if they must, they must have just made a mess of those silver ones with
[31:29.520 --> 31:34.960]  blue straps because that was what that was all you could get. Right. That's for the developer one.
[31:34.960 --> 31:40.960]  Right. And that to me contributes to the idea that that whatever the reason, whether, you know,
[31:40.960 --> 31:49.200]  it's like factory A is supposed to be making black sport bands, factory B is making blue ones
[31:49.200 --> 31:55.680]  and green ones and factory A at labor problems or an electrical shortage or, you know, maybe
[31:55.680 --> 31:59.520]  like whatever the chemicals are they mixed to make the black, they couldn't get enough of them,
[31:59.520 --> 32:04.720]  but they could get plenty of the ones for blue or white or whatever. But it definitely seemed to me
[32:04.720 --> 32:09.760]  like they, you know, could not make those bands in equal numbers. And the fact that they only offered
[32:09.760 --> 32:16.320]  the, the developer ones in blue, yeah, exactly, it must seem to be that that, you know, they could
[32:16.320 --> 32:22.160]  make as many of the blue ones as they wanted. It also makes me think that it's the band, the bands
[32:22.160 --> 32:31.040]  in particular might be part of the constraints, you know, because it's, there's no matter which
[32:31.040 --> 32:38.160]  sport watch you go to buy, it's like you can't just get one. Right. You just know, there's no
[32:38.160 --> 32:43.120]  color combination where you can just go to Apple.com and get one sent to you tomorrow. Like
[32:43.120 --> 32:47.360]  you're, everybody says June, if you both, no matter what you want to buy right now today, it says
[32:47.360 --> 32:54.800]  June. But, but I'm looking at the, well, at least the black sport band says you can get it in May.
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.360]  So they as well, it says available to ship in May. Oh, and saying it doesn't think anything more
[33:01.360 --> 33:07.280]  including the watch or just the sport, no, just the sport band. Huh. Yeah, so I don't know.
[33:07.280 --> 33:12.400]  Yeah. I don't know. And Tim Cook mentioned, you know, he said something about like the fact that
[33:12.960 --> 33:18.560]  they were able to catch up a little bit over the weekend. Yeah. They were able to ship more than
[33:18.560 --> 33:24.800]  they thought that they, you know, they found some under a table or something. And we're able to
[33:24.800 --> 33:31.520]  ship some faster than what the date said initially indicated. Yeah. And I, I know that there,
[33:31.520 --> 33:36.160]  and I know that a lot of it is for competitive reasons. And I think part of it is for pride reasons
[33:36.160 --> 33:40.240]  that they just don't want to talk about the problems. I mean, like for example, I mean, remember
[33:40.880 --> 33:47.440]  the, the white first white iPhone that like didn't ship for nine months. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was weird.
[33:47.440 --> 33:51.680]  That was like, when that was like a manufacturing thing, right? I mean, they'd,
[33:51.680 --> 33:56.560]  yeah, clearly. They could, there was like the, something was bleeding through like the camera was
[33:57.200 --> 34:03.520]  yeah, affected because light was bleeding through the white plastic. It was like somehow they could
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.880]  make them, obviously they could make them not at scale because they had demo units that people saw
[34:08.880 --> 34:12.000]  and, you know, people knew people who were to Apple who had them. But for some reason, they could
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  not produce the white ones at scale. The scale they needed to sell them. But that was, it was
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.240]  seriously like nine months. It was like close to being like because I know I mentioned this on the show
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.160]  years ago, but Amy ordered that phone and because she wanted to get a white one. And it got to the
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.440]  point where I actually don't even remember if we canceled it or what what we did because it got to
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.200]  the point where it was like, even if she got it, it was going to be close. It was clearly going to be
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.920]  close next to the next iPhone. I think that's what she did. I think she canceled and just said,
[34:43.920 --> 34:47.840]  you know, I'm actually just going to wait and get the next one because it's ridiculous, you know,
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.360]  to wait nine months. Yeah. So I think there's all sorts of little problems like that. And at the
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.800]  scale of like the first month, it's to be expected that there's going to be some kind of weird
[34:58.800 --> 35:03.840]  problem. Like we didn't expect it, but the black sport band is really hard to make. They keep
[35:03.840 --> 35:08.400]  coming out really dark gray. And it's, you know, that's not acceptable. They're supposed to be black
[35:08.400 --> 35:15.520]  or, you know, they're not bendy enough for something supple enough. They're nice.
[35:17.040 --> 35:23.600]  Did you feel good? I haven't worn, I mean, I have worn leather bands. We actually, my last one
[35:23.600 --> 35:31.040]  was nylon, but I've mostly worn leather bands for, you know, forever. So I was kind of slightly
[35:31.040 --> 35:37.600]  concerned about how it would feel, but it's pretty good. That's like maybe like the single most
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.360]  common thing tweeted at me as people open their watches. They're like, wow, you were right,
[35:43.360 --> 35:49.760]  the sport band is really is nice. Or, you know, my favorite version is wow, I thought you were
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.400]  full of shit when you talked about how nice the sport band is, but you're right, it's, it's really,
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.560]  really great. I heard from people that went to the try-ons too, who said the same thing or they
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.720]  were like, I really, you know, I could not believe that you were going on on them, but sport band
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.880]  in your review. And then I went to the Apple store and I thought it was the nicest feeling
[36:08.880 --> 36:12.240]  one of all of them, including, you know, like the super expensive ones.
[36:12.240 --> 36:18.880]  Have you had watches with metal bands before? Yeah, I've been wearing a watch with a metal bracelet
[36:18.880 --> 36:24.880]  for years. Okay. All right. All right. As I did that, I did that for a while. Like when I first
[36:24.880 --> 36:31.840]  started wearing like a nice watch, not like a kid's watch. And I just, you know, I found the hair,
[36:31.840 --> 36:36.480]  I found the hair to be a problem. It's not really the hair, the hair snagging to be a problem.
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.000]  Yeah, my wrists are not hairless, but they're not like I was no way like, well, I'm not, yeah,
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.760]  I'm not, I'm no, I'm no paul kafasas, but I don't know. I don't know. There must be part of the
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.600]  design. No, it must be like the gross part of being a, a link bracelet designer when you go and
[36:55.600 --> 37:03.280]  test the hair, they must have, they must have like a stable of extremely your suit men that
[37:03.280 --> 37:09.040]  they work with. To give it a try. Come on over and try this. And then they like start measuring
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.920]  how many hairs come out or something like that. Yeah, like Paul, Neven Murgen, and Adam,
[37:13.920 --> 37:19.520]  Melissa Gore together. And those guys, they should just run their own, run their own watch band
[37:19.520 --> 37:25.360]  business testing, testing watch bands. All right. So the other thing before we move on,
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.560]  just talking about the watches shipping, the story that broke yesterday, the Wall Street Journal
[37:30.560 --> 37:37.040]  had a report that, I think to summarize that Apple has a discovered a serious production
[37:37.040 --> 37:41.840]  problem with the Taptic engine and that behind the scenes, they had commissioned two different
[37:41.840 --> 37:48.720]  factories to make them one in China and one in Japan. And that the ones from the company in China
[37:48.720 --> 37:54.320]  had a defect or not. Oh, I don't think it was all of them, but that the too many of them,
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.920]  way too many of them had a defect such that it after some amount of use, it would stop working.
[38:01.280 --> 38:05.360]  And at the ones from Japan don't have this problem, but that means they only have half as many
[38:05.360 --> 38:13.360]  Taptic engines as, and I guess they didn't say half because they didn't say what percentage of the
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.640]  mix can only get them from one source reliably. Right. And now they've had to shift their plan
[38:18.640 --> 38:22.800]  so that they're going to get all of them from the company in Japan, but it's going to take a while
[38:22.800 --> 38:31.840]  because the Japanese maker wasn't prepared to make them any. And the Wall Street Journal story
[38:31.840 --> 38:38.720]  made it sound as though that's the answer to why the watch is seemingly taking a while to
[38:40.400 --> 38:46.080]  for supply to meet demand. I think they're right about the Taptic engine thing. They say,
[38:46.080 --> 38:51.280]  I mean, it seems pretty clear that they've got a source at least a source at the Chinese company
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.400]  and probably the Japanese one too. I don't think that came from Apple. I'm almost certain
[38:58.400 --> 39:06.480]  it did not because I don't think Apple wants anything like that to come out. I think it came from
[39:06.480 --> 39:12.240]  the supply chain, but I don't know that it's the only one because I don't understand, for example,
[39:12.240 --> 39:18.560]  why haven't my standalone bands shipped yet. I think there's even the bands are taking a while.
[39:20.080 --> 39:25.280]  I'm guessing if you're Jeff Williams or Tim Cook and that you read the story in the journal that says,
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.400]  well, there's one problem. It's the Taptic engine and it's this one thing. Like that they're just
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.400]  rolling their eyes. Like, oh, God, if only if only that was the only problem, you know.
[39:37.920 --> 39:42.240]  So you said you said that you got one that had a bad Taptic engine.
[39:42.240 --> 39:51.440]  I'm initially right. Right. The review unit that I got the first day. I thought when I first,
[39:51.440 --> 39:57.520]  I tried it on and there's just a little bit of a briefing with Apple people and they
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.280]  make sure everything's all right. And everything was working and it definitely was getting
[40:03.280 --> 40:08.000]  taps. But I remember thinking at first, wow, the taps don't seem strong enough. I'll have to
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.960]  play with the settings on that because that doesn't feel like I remember it feeling. I didn't go to
[40:12.960 --> 40:18.000]  the event March because of the eye thing. But back in September, when I tried one of the
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.680]  things on that was playing the demo loop, which is either identical or very close to the demo
[40:23.680 --> 40:28.880]  loop on the ones in the stores, I remember the taps feeling a lot stronger. But I thought,
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.560]  well, I'll play with the settings and I played with the settings and it never really seemed strong
[40:32.560 --> 40:36.960]  enough and I thought, hmm, it's a little disappointing. And then by the night time, it seemed to me like
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.040]  it was like, I don't know that this is working right. I may have to, you know, it's already too late.
[40:41.760 --> 40:45.840]  But in the morning, I'm going to have to look into this because I suspect I really, and it made me
[40:45.840 --> 40:49.760]  think I was crazy because I always, in the back of my head, I always thought that maybe the
[40:49.760 --> 40:55.840]  review units that they give people were like super units that they like, you know, I wouldn't put
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.280]  a past Apple that they would go like when they give you someone like me or, you know, or
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.480]  poker or anybody who gets these review units that they like cherry pick like, you know, they open up
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.480]  the phone and they're like, this is perfect. This is, you know, this is beyond our, you know, measures
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.960]  of quality for what we ship out to everybody. But, you know, this is the best of the best. But
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.880]  apparently, you know, it's not. And I do remember when I got my review unit watch that it was sealed,
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.360]  like the box and everything was all sealed up, which doesn't mean that they didn't seal it,
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.880]  you know, but it was definitely sealed. But I think it was just like a watch that came out of
[41:32.880 --> 41:38.880]  the early production runs. And it sounds exactly like what the journal described, where it
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.440]  kind of worked. I'm not quite sure. I could be misremembering that it was too weak the first day.
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.640]  That may or may not just be me not being used to it or not having the link bracelet tight enough.
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.280]  Because I eventually, I took out one extra link of the link bracelet than what I had the first day.
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.120]  And I think that was part of it. Like it's a lot more comfortable to me. You know, I think it was
[41:57.120 --> 42:03.120]  too loose the first day too. But without question the second day by like 11 o'clock in the morning,
[42:03.120 --> 42:10.000]  it just wasn't tapping at all. And it sounds awful lot like what they're describing,
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.960]  which is, I think hard to test because it seems like the sort of failure where any kind of
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.160]  test you did that's just like hook it up, see if it taps, see if, you know, get a notification,
[42:20.160 --> 42:25.280]  see if it taps. Okay, good to go. Then it's, you know, that's a problem. Like it wasn't like a dead
[42:25.280 --> 42:31.280]  unit. It was a unit that failed very quickly. Yeah. Well, that's interesting to note. I mean,
[42:31.280 --> 42:38.800]  to see if that, because that to me implies like maybe there'll be issues over the longer term.
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.760]  Right. Like how, are there any that are going to fail after 30 days or some days or something?
[42:43.760 --> 42:49.920]  Or a year. I mean, you know, six months to a year. Yeah. I heard from at least one reader who I know
[42:50.960 --> 42:57.280]  definitely trust, whose support Apple Sport Watch definitely had a dead tactic unit,
[42:57.280 --> 43:02.480]  took it in the Apple store and the genius was, you know, had hadn't heard it. And he said,
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.160]  like he emphasized, you know, they were like, wow, that was the first one, you know, first time
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.880]  they've heard of this problem. But they verified definitely wasn't tapping and gave him a replacement,
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.880]  his replacement unit, which I thought was interesting too. Like how do they do that? It was just
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.480]  the watch. So they took his straps off, just gave him a new watch and put it in, which I think,
[43:22.480 --> 43:27.120]  I mean, who knows what they're going to do once supply isn't so constrained, but that makes a
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.440]  lot of sense to me that each store got delivered a certain number of just playing watches without
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.640]  any straps for any of those problems. And not, you know, like I wrote yesterday, it seems like
[43:36.640 --> 43:44.880]  nobody's blowing this out of control other than the judge report, but it, I don't think it's true,
[43:44.880 --> 43:50.400]  the line that a couple people put out like recode and a few others that none of the units
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.160]  left the factory, because it seems pretty clear that I got one as a review unit.
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.640]  And somebody else did. Right. And somebody else did too. But it seems incredibly rare, because it
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.240]  does not, it seems to me like the sort of thing where even if like one out of 100 people had the
[44:04.240 --> 44:09.680]  problem, you know, it would be like the Bengate thing. Yeah. Like I don't think one out of 100
[44:09.680 --> 44:14.640]  iPhone six is bent. I think it was way less than that. And you can see that even if it's like
[44:14.640 --> 44:19.600]  a half of 1% or, you know, whatever, one in a thousand, how quickly something like that can escalate.
[44:19.600 --> 44:24.960]  Um, so I think it was crazy, I could crazy odd coincidence that I got one as a review unit,
[44:25.840 --> 44:32.640]  except maybe it's not so crazy because the review units went out so much earlier. And so maybe
[44:32.640 --> 44:37.360]  they weren't- Yeah, they hadn't caught it then. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking. Yeah. Um,
[44:38.880 --> 44:44.080]  you know, but it's interesting, I didn't realize that they would, I mean, I just assume that
[44:44.080 --> 44:50.320]  all this stuff comes from China now. And I was kind of surprised that they're getting a lot of
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.640]  some of these parts from Japan too. Yeah, I did think that was interesting too. Although I guess
[44:54.640 --> 44:59.120]  I'm not surprised though, because you know, I know that the Japanese still make an awful lot of
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.680]  stuff, you know, that they're, it's, you know, made in Japan is still a big thing for a lot of
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.280]  their consumer electronics. Yeah. Although I guess I, I just didn't, I didn't know how much of
[45:09.280 --> 45:15.120]  that was really that, you know, like, like we do, like, like Apple made in Cupertino, but when
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.880]  it's really made in China. Yeah, I'm assuming, I'm assuming the Japanese source from China as well.
[45:21.520 --> 45:26.640]  Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting, but it particularly for components to see that's the
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.000]  thing. I would have think that maybe, okay, maybe they're doing the final assembly in Japan,
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.360]  but they're getting most of their components from Chinese China. But who knows, I don't know,
[45:35.360 --> 45:43.120]  but yeah, yeah. Taptic engines coming from Japan, at least for now. Um, I don't know,
[45:43.120 --> 45:51.360]  what anything else on the shipping? Uh, I mean, they're just funny that the UPS guy asked me
[45:51.360 --> 45:56.160]  what color I got. Oh, yeah. I always like, I just like that when they know, they know what's
[45:56.160 --> 46:02.800]  going on. They've got their finger on the pulse of products coming out. You know what? I guess,
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.600]  I guess the other thing I wanted to make on that was with Tim Cook's comments on an analyst call
[46:07.600 --> 46:14.400]  about, you know, the demand. I do think I always say this and I think people just don't give
[46:14.400 --> 46:21.440]  them enough credit. They're, they're tight-lipped Apple, famously. But what they do say is usually
[46:21.440 --> 46:28.480]  very true. Like, they don't, you know, it's worth listening to the words, even if you think it's
[46:28.480 --> 46:33.280]  a little vapid. And I feel like Tim Cook's comments about any time you make, I mean, this isn't
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.680]  a quote. It's a paraphrase. But any time you make the first generation of a new product,
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.760]  you expect things like this. Um, and I think things plural is important because I really don't
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.520]  think it's just the Taptic engine. I think it's just a, I think it's just a nightmare,
[46:47.520 --> 46:54.480]  shipping these things the first time. Um, but it really does make you wonder at how good they've
[46:54.480 --> 47:00.000]  gotten at making phones because of how that the ridiculous number of iPhone six and six
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.440]  pluses that they shipped right away. Like, you know, like immediately on day one, like how many of
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.840]  them went out? Yeah, it spoiled me. I mean, that, and that's why I was so surprised that one
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.280]  my wife ordered it at a four minutes past midnight that she, that it's still what's going to be
[47:13.280 --> 47:17.680]  like a month. Yeah. Like it was going to be a month away. I think that, and I think, I think you're
[47:17.680 --> 47:23.120]  not alone. And I think John mulch, you're a reasonable man and a patient man. And I think some of our,
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.640]  you know, friends out there in the internet are not as reasonable and patient. Um, but I do
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.720]  think that that has fueled the, the, the frustration that people have that they don't have their
[47:34.720 --> 47:42.240]  watch it, you know, that, yeah, it's like, I'm sure that there's parts of iPhone six and six
[47:42.240 --> 47:46.800]  plus that, you know, obviously our, you know, the cameras are new and touch ideas improved. It's a new
[47:46.800 --> 47:52.640]  touch ID sensor. Um, even compared to the five S, you know, so there's new components, but it's like
[47:52.640 --> 47:56.160]  components, even if they're new, they're the type of thing that they know how to make,
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.760]  and they know how to source, you know, how to get big quality, quantity, whereas, you know,
[48:01.760 --> 48:05.520]  who I mean, who even knows? I mean, like the digital crown, like there's no other dingus in the
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.600]  universe, like the Apple Watch digital crown, right? Maybe that thing's hard to make,
[48:10.400 --> 48:16.560]  but it's like nothing. It's like the haptics are relatively. Yeah. Well, it's like,
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.480]  unlike anything else, right. Yeah. So it seems like that would, yeah, I think you kind of
[48:22.480 --> 48:25.760]  have to take him out of his word that this is really to be expected. You know, and if there's
[48:25.760 --> 48:36.400]  anything that they blew, it was the, the same emphasizing that April 24th date, right, right,
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.280]  because I think a lot of people thought that they would be able to line up if they didn't get one
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.800]  pre-order, they would line up with the store and get one instead. It is possible. It's possible
[48:44.800 --> 48:48.800]  that that was their plan at the time and maybe this taptic engine thing. I mean, because the
[48:48.800 --> 48:52.640]  taptic thing really does sound like maybe they, for at least a while, they're only going to be
[48:52.640 --> 48:59.920]  able to make half as many as they expected to. And, you know, and that they just as a rough ballpark,
[48:59.920 --> 49:08.800]  maybe the half that they decided to make all went to the pre-orders and the half that they were
[49:08.800 --> 49:14.000]  maybe going to put in retail stores were the ones like, well, sorry, Angela, you know, we're going
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.880]  to, you know, well, you know what I mean? There's just a lot of people blaming Angela
[49:18.880 --> 49:22.320]  Orange for this, which is baffling to me. No, it's, yeah, right. It's baffling to me too. I mean,
[49:22.320 --> 49:25.440]  it doesn't make any sense. It's, I mean, if you have anybody, you should blame Jeff Williams.
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.720]  Yeah, exactly. I honestly, I hate to say it. I really do, because I know there's got to be somebody
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.000]  out there listening to the show who's got the blame Angela angle, but I really do think it's sort of
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.560]  like a misogynist. No, misogyny might be the wrong word, but a bias against women. Like, I don't,
[49:42.560 --> 49:47.280]  I really do think that there's some, some of the tweets I've seen like calling for her to be like
[49:47.280 --> 49:52.240]  held responsible. I've seen people seriously, like not like spit coming out of their mouths raging
[49:52.240 --> 49:58.160]  mad, but like seemingly dead serious who say that she should be fired over this, which is crazy to me.
[49:58.160 --> 50:04.080]  And I really do. I hate to say it because I don't like to, I try not to like knee jerks see biases
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.160]  like that, but I really don't think they'd be doing that if, you know, Ron Johnson was still on the job.
[50:08.160 --> 50:13.920]  Yeah. And I don't quite think it's just because she's a woman. I think it's this combination
[50:13.920 --> 50:20.240]  of her being a woman from the fashion world and that the people who were blaming her are the
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.560]  people who also think that Apple is making a misstep by stepping away from the being a more
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.520]  technological company and more of a fashion company. Well, it's, and it's also just like, she's new
[50:31.520 --> 50:38.720]  and it's the first launch. Right. From her first big product launch that she's involved. Right.
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.240]  But it's like, I don't think that the problem was that problem is not, it's not the setup in the
[50:44.240 --> 50:48.720]  stores. It's not the training of the retail employees. Or that she forgot to fill out a form.
[50:50.560 --> 50:55.120]  You know, and then like, you know, Tim Cook, you know, is like, I guess, oh, she doesn't want
[50:55.120 --> 51:00.800]  any for the retail stores. I guess she thinks there's no time and so she knows what she knows
[51:00.800 --> 51:05.200]  what she's doing. She was CEO of Burberry. Yeah. So I guess, you know, I just let that go. Yeah.
[51:05.200 --> 51:08.720]  And then whoopsie. There's no watches in the stores on April 24th.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.600]  No, I don't know. I can't believe that there are people who blame her. I mean, there are no,
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.080]  there are no watches for them to put in the stores. And they can't even, there can't even
[51:20.080 --> 51:27.280]  fulfill the, the male, the online orders. Yeah. Right. They can't fulfill the orders and
[51:27.280 --> 51:31.200]  there are no watches for the stores. So I'm not quite sure what, what, what, what exactly she's
[51:31.200 --> 51:34.800]  supposed to be doing. Right. And it's entirely, and I've seen people say, well, then she never,
[51:34.800 --> 51:39.840]  they never should have said April 24th, but it's entirely possible that when they said April 24,
[51:39.840 --> 51:46.720]  back on March 9th, that they thought they could do it and that it changed. So, you know,
[51:46.720 --> 51:49.440]  she's now responsible for testing the Taptic engine. Right.
[51:49.440 --> 51:59.440]  Let me thank our second sponsor and it's our good friends at Casper. You guys know Casper.
[51:59.440 --> 52:06.320]  It's a place where you go and you buy your mattress online, which I know sounds crazy.
[52:09.200 --> 52:14.080]  Hear me out here. Maybe I'm crazy. Could be another good mother's day gift. What
[52:14.080 --> 52:20.080]  by the way, to thank your mom for conceiving you, then buying her a mattress.
[52:23.280 --> 52:30.160]  Think about your or your or your wife or your wife. Yeah. Honey, you're such a great mother.
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.680]  Let's do it again. This is what they make. They make obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly
[52:35.680 --> 52:42.000]  fair prices. Just the right sink, just the right bounce. They use two technologies. They don't make
[52:42.000 --> 52:48.080]  you choose from a crazy variety of different mattress types based on descriptions. They made one
[52:48.080 --> 52:54.880]  good mattress technology and it uses two of one good mattress style and it uses two technologies,
[52:54.880 --> 53:00.960]  latex foam and memory foam and they combine it to give you just the right amount of what one
[53:00.960 --> 53:05.040]  is good for and what the other is good for. They come together and you get better nights,
[53:05.040 --> 53:07.840]  brighter days. You feel great when you wake up because you get a good night's sleep.
[53:07.840 --> 53:14.000]  Here's the thing. I know it sounds so crazy to buy a mattress online because you don't even
[53:14.000 --> 53:19.440]  get to touch it or whatever, let alone jump on it or whatever you do in the stores. They have a
[53:19.440 --> 53:25.440]  risk-free trial and return policy. They give you a hundred days. So you go there by the size you
[53:25.440 --> 53:33.440]  want. It shows up at your house in this crazy compressed vacuum sealed box, which is a big box.
[53:33.440 --> 53:37.840]  It's probably the biggest package that I've gotten delivered to my house in a long time,
[53:37.840 --> 53:45.040]  but crazy small for a mattress. You take it to the room. Again, listen to me. You take it to the
[53:45.040 --> 53:51.600]  room where you want it and then you open the box according to their instructions and all of a
[53:51.600 --> 53:58.000]  sudden you have a mattress. Wow. It is crazy. Their mattresses are made in America. They are American
[53:58.000 --> 54:05.200]  made, really high quality stuff. The prices are so much lower than stuff you see in the mattress
[54:05.200 --> 54:11.200]  retail stores, which is really, really a cartel. If you haven't shopped for a mattress in years,
[54:11.200 --> 54:14.800]  it is so crazy because you go to store A, and even if you're looking at the same brand,
[54:14.800 --> 54:19.760]  like Celia or whatever, and you write down prices and you say, well, I think I like that one.
[54:19.760 --> 54:22.640]  You write down the name of the model and then you go to the next store so you can see what the
[54:22.640 --> 54:28.240]  prices, there is no model with the same name. Each store that they sell mattresses to, they give
[54:28.240 --> 54:33.120]  custom names to the mattresses so that you can't. They, specifically, the whole product line
[54:33.120 --> 54:39.360]  of all the major mattresses are made so that you can't price compare. Then there's all these
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.680]  websites. Of course, third party websites that help you product compare and they're like the
[54:43.680 --> 54:53.120]  Postropitic Flipity B is like the Rubik's Cube, ding a C from this store or whatever the names
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.360]  are. I'm not really good at naming mattresses, but it makes it impossible. Here's the deal.
[54:57.360 --> 55:02.400]  You go to Casper and it's just simple. One style of mattress, you pick the size and the prices
[55:02.400 --> 55:09.920]  are great. 500 bucks for a twin size mattress, 950 bucks for king size mattress. Now you compare
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.440]  that to the industry prices for a good mattress and it's just outstanding. Way to under. You cannot
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.400]  buy a good king size mattress for under a thousand bucks. Where do you go to find that more?
[55:20.400 --> 55:31.520]  www.caspersleep.com. C-A-S-P-E-R. Caspersleep.com slash talk show. Know that. Just slash talk show.
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.720]  Use that URL and you'll save 50 bucks and I will not tell your mom that you use the coupon code
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.280]  to get her her mother stay mattress. But go there check it out if you need a mattress or a
[55:42.320 --> 55:46.720]  really interesting mother stay gift. That box is crazy small. It's crazy small.
[55:47.440 --> 55:53.360]  Well, it's big. Yeah. I mean, it's a big box, but it's not, you know, it's not the size of a mattress.
[55:53.360 --> 56:01.200]  When we got ours, the funny thing when we got ours, we weren't home because it was and I
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.880]  wouldn't have ordered it if I was ordering it. We were on vacation over the summer and but it was
[56:06.880 --> 56:10.880]  like they wanted to send one to me because, you know, they wanted me to have one because if
[56:10.880 --> 56:14.480]  when we're talking about it, you know, a lot more genuine if I've actually, I can vouch that the
[56:14.480 --> 56:22.400]  thing is actually a good mattress. So they sent it while we were on vacation and my neighbor signed for
[56:23.200 --> 56:30.720]  not knowing we were on vacation and he had to hold that box for 10 days. It was like the worst
[56:30.720 --> 56:38.080]  possible timing. It's a big box for it. Yeah, but I got it. We got a pressure washer delivered
[56:38.080 --> 56:43.600]  the other day and it was the boxes about the same size. Yeah, crazy, which is, you know, it's not a
[56:43.600 --> 56:51.120]  big pressure washer. Yeah. What else is going on? Do you see this thing where another thing going
[56:51.120 --> 56:58.720]  back to the earnings report where Tim Cook said something about, you know, that he had never
[56:58.720 --> 57:03.360]  never seen one of those component breakdowns, you know, where that these guys they break open
[57:03.360 --> 57:08.480]  an Apple product and then they itemize everything they see inside and then they tell you that
[57:08.480 --> 57:14.560]  it costs, you know, $67 to make an iPhone and that Apple's profit mod margins are, you know,
[57:14.560 --> 57:21.360]  400%. He said he's never seen one that was accurate. And I believe again, yeah, which I wouldn't
[57:21.360 --> 57:28.400]  be again, I take him at his word that they're not, they're not believable. And I quit on
[57:28.400 --> 57:34.800]  daring fireball countdown to I supply saying the Apple watch costs $67 and three, two, one.
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.880]  And lo and behold, today, I supply came out with a thing that said Apple watch. I was off by a
[57:40.880 --> 57:47.600]  little. They said it costs $83 to make. And that is, is that what IHS technology is? Is that I
[57:47.600 --> 57:55.600]  think so? I believe that that is I supply. So even though on the analyst conference column,
[57:56.560 --> 58:02.000]  which I believe, you know, there are like like the things that Tim Cook and the CFO, what's the new
[58:02.000 --> 58:11.360]  CFO's name? Luca Luca, I don't want to say Luca Bronsey. No, it's not Luca Bronsey. I can't pronounce
[58:11.360 --> 58:17.360]  it. Yeah. Well, Luca, I'll just call him on first name. Luca, you know, I'm pretty sure that they
[58:17.360 --> 58:23.520]  are like literally like on the hook for the things that they say, like those are like, you know,
[58:23.520 --> 58:28.880]  like there's SEC guidelines, you know, regarding what they say. And so usually they're evasive. And
[58:28.880 --> 58:33.840]  if they say something that's true, it's like it sort of has to legally be true. And they even said
[58:33.840 --> 58:39.600]  that the margins on Apple watch at least next quarter, they're only guiding for the next quarter.
[58:39.600 --> 58:44.560]  And so it could be, you know, this could be steered by first generation initial product runs.
[58:44.560 --> 58:50.240]  They emphasize first connect this coming quarter, the profit margins on Apple watch will be lower
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.400]  than usual, you know, the rest of the companies in the rest of the product. All right. And that
[58:54.400 --> 58:59.280]  includes all Apple watches, including, you know, let's just assume the addition is going to sell
[58:59.280 --> 59:06.320]  in this relatively small numbers that we assume. But even, you know, like the, the $800,000
[59:06.320 --> 59:11.600]  stainless steel ones, which presumably are going to have higher margins than the $350 and $400
[59:11.600 --> 59:18.880]  sport models that the margins are going to be lower. Well, I supply says that no, it's going to be
[59:18.880 --> 59:26.240]  the most profitable, the highest markup of any Apple product, $81 and $20 they say. And that
[59:26.240 --> 59:30.560]  the stupid thing is off the, off the face of it. I mean, they admit that it does not include logistics,
[59:30.560 --> 59:37.280]  amortized capital expenses overhead, S G and a selling general administration expenses R and D software,
[59:37.280 --> 59:44.400]  IP licensing and other variables through the supply chain, such as electronic manufacturing services
[59:44.400 --> 59:51.280]  provider. So, I mean, our off, you know, it's basically, it's like to like those things where
[59:51.280 --> 59:57.920]  you know, the human body is made up of like $5 a chemicals. It's yeah, technically that's true,
[59:57.920 --> 1:00:00.880]  but you cannot make a human body if you go up by $5 a chemical.
[1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:10.880]  I've seen some websites though, where they claim that you can. That's not a real human.
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:19.120]  No, it's not. Oh, but there's also, oh, I see. If you read down the story a little bit, that
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:26.960]  $81 and 20 cents, they also add in, they say it, the total cost to produce the watch is $83
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:34.240]  and $0.70 when the $2.50 per unit manufacturing expenses added in. So according to that, it costs
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:42.560]  $2.50 to manufacture an Apple watch. So the thing, but they do this all the time. I mean, they do
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:48.240]  this for, I mean, for many products. Yeah, but it's only, I always find them kind of uninteresting.
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:57.120]  The, I, but I can't help but think that with Apple products in particular, they, they know that
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:08.480]  there's like a, what's the word, a, the, the public has a sense that Apple is ripping us off.
[1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:12.960]  And again, I, you and I think I've talked about this several times that like they play into it
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:19.120]  sometimes. Like when they charge $80 for the USB dongle for the new Mac, right? Isn't it 80 bucks?
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.880]  Like that play, because that's actually true. That is not an 80 dollar component. Like they're,
[1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:30.080]  that, you know, and then they're, they're ram prices. And like if you want to upgrade the hard drive
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:34.000]  on a, you know, on a new MacBook, something like that, that's all that, all those, all that stuff
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.320]  is nowhere near, although they've got a lot better. They've got a lot better on the hard drive.
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.520]  They've gotten better, but they've also at the same time, they've locked down the, like, you,
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:46.400]  you know, you can't do it yourself anymore. You know, whereas you used to like, I used, you know,
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:50.800]  be able to get an iMac and say, okay, well, I'm just going to skimp on the RAM on the hard drive.
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:53.920]  And, you know, a couple of years from now, I can upgrade the RAM on upgrade the hard drive.
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:55.120]  You know, I can't do that anymore.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:00.400]  I've always been a little lazy. And I've never, never liked snapping RAM into place, because it
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:05.920]  never, ever, ever has felt to me as though I wasn't breaking it. Every time I've ever done it,
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.400]  it always felt like I'm breaking it. And I don't do it. I never did it enough to really get good at
[1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:15.760]  it. You know, like, I know that there's some people who like, like, if you work in IT and you're
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:20.720]  work at a company and you, you set up a lot of new PCs and you always buy the RAM separate or
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:24.720]  something like that, well, then you get good at snapping RAM in and out. And you know what it feels
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:29.840]  like. But every time I bought like a new, a new Mac and then would buy the RAM separately,
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:35.120]  which I would do because the prices were so ridiculously better. And you never got enough RAM in
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.000]  the default configuration from Apple. I did it. But it always, every single time I buy a new Mac,
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  I think, well, maybe this time I'll let Apple give me the RAM and then I just go there and compare
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:50.880]  the prices. I'd be like, no way. It's gotten better. But it's not good. But so they do play into it.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:55.920]  And I remember you and I talking about it, we even said like, look, you know, it's easy for us to
[1:02:55.920 --> 1:03:01.600]  spend Apple's money and say they should just, you know, give people things. But it's like when
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:05.200]  they had the lightning adapter thing, like they should have just had buckets of those lightning
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:10.240]  to 30 pin things and just giving them to people in the store. Just, you know, people come in and
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:14.240]  say, hey, you know, my husband has the old phone and I've got the new phone and now our cables don't
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:18.240]  work here. Take a couple here. Have a couple of these. Just something cheap. Something cheap. Very
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:23.360]  cheap for goodwill. Right. Whereas their answer was, well, give us $29 and we'll sell you one or maybe
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:28.560]  it was 19, but either way, it just, it made people feel it. So people have that sense. And Apple
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:33.280]  does do certain things that play into it. And I feel like I supplies whole thing with these press
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:41.840]  releases is just catered to hit that perception, you know, that Apple is ripping this off. And it's
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:48.320]  like, I definitely think that the USB adapter for the MacBook does not cost $80 or even close to it.
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:58.320]  I think there's a pretty stiff markup on that. I do not think that the Apple watch sport costs $83
[1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:07.120]  to make. And this, yeah, the only thing that bug me in this, this venture be piece that you
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:12.800]  will send me the link to is that this part perhaps the most interesting component price is the
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:21.120]  analysis in this and the analysis is that of the battery 80 cents. If IHS is estimate is correct,
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.040]  it seems that Apple spent a laughably small amount of money on the one component that seems to
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:30.320]  hinder the capabilities of the watch the most. Okay, well, that says nothing about what the other
[1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:36.560]  options were. It's just like assuming that if they had spent more on the battery, then they would
[1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:41.280]  have gotten more battery. Well, there may not be another option. And there certainly may not be
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:50.080]  another option in that, that size. Right. So it's just, it appeals to, it's just, it's just
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:55.280]  joke I'll leave written. Right. Like the, even the people who bite and then write a story about it
[1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:59.360]  are then, you know, the only people who even buy into it are people who are such
[1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:05.120]  facile thinkers that they're subject to like analysis like that. Like who knows, you know,
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:10.080]  I don't know anything. Maybe, maybe it literally is an 80 to 80 cent component to put that
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:16.080]  battery in there. But there's, it doesn't mean that it's, it's not like there's empty space that
[1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:23.280]  they've left go, you know, it's not like if they had spent about 60 instead that you get two days
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:32.400]  of battery life. Right. Like, yeah, I just died doubt that that was, I mean, given their already,
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:36.880]  you know, they already seem concerned about the battery life. Initially, you know, from the,
[1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:40.160]  from the beginning of it, they wouldn't mention it. And then they were saying, okay, we're,
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:45.600]  we're carefully saying that they're setting this watch up so that it'll give you a day's worth
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:50.080]  of battery. I think if they had an option for a bigger battery, they probably would have gone for it.
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:58.000]  Uh, yeah, definitely. I think so or a better battery or something. For the extra, extra 20 cents.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:07.360]  Right. Like, I still know, I do find it like, I find it unlikely that it's an 80 cent component
[1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:13.840]  because I've bought watch batteries before and like regular watch batteries, the one that like
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:21.120]  you put in a Casio or like a time max cost a couple bucks. You know, and I know that when you're
[1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:26.480]  buying its scale, you could get like, you know, it's different than going into the hardware store
[1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:33.760]  and buying one watch battery. But that's a watch battery that runs like a totally low powered
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:40.240]  machine. And this is a battery that runs like an iOS computer. Uh, so I really doubt that it's 80
[1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:45.760]  cents. It just gets me. It gets me every time. It's the I supply thing is like such a pet peeve of
[1:06:45.760 --> 1:06:52.480]  mine. And I know that I should just let it go, but I can't. I'm trying to see if the tactic
[1:06:53.840 --> 1:07:00.080]  engine is on here someplace. Touch controller, other.
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:08.320]  And because there's a, I mean, I'm assuming that that piece is that that's not a standard
[1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:14.320]  component that you can just pick up, you know, they're not just like buckets of those law. Obviously
[1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:19.360]  there are not buckets of those things lying around someplace because their supply is constrained
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:25.840]  because they got a bunch of bad ones. So how do you estimate something that was probably built
[1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:32.720]  pretty much specifically for this watch? I honestly have no idea. I think that they don't even
[1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:39.040]  try. I think that they just, well, it's like I can't pick it out here anyway. Oh, capacitive
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:46.240]  touch. No, that because that's the screen. I don't know. I, and every time I write about this,
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:51.280]  and it's been a hobby horse in mind for years. Um, and if I write about it or podcast about it,
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:55.120]  I always get some amount of feedback. Let me try to preemptively cut you off. Hopefully,
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:08:00.000]  those of you who are doing this have, haven't started emailing me already. Like the response
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:05.280]  is usually from people who like read my site or listen to the show, nuanced. And it's not just
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:11.280]  knee jerky. Oh, I know that the only cost $40 make an iPhone and a reveal. Um, like my readers
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:16.000]  and listeners are smart and that, but they, they always emphasize the, well, they're not, they're not
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.400]  trying to say that it takes into account, you know, the, the factory to build these things or assemble
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:26.240]  it. And, you know, they're just saying, they're literally just saying what the components cost.
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:32.560]  Um, and they're not trying to, you know, to put research and development into it. And they're not,
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:38.480]  you know, that it is fair. But I think even if you take all that under consideration,
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:44.080]  it still clearly isn't right because I just, there's no way to mesh the fact that they're saying
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:51.200]  that this is the highest margin product Apple makes with Apple saying on a public analyst call
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:54.800]  that it's going to have a lower than not the lowest. They didn't say that. They just had
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:00.240]  lower than the company's average. So it cannot be true that the low, and they're saying that the
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:06.640]  lowest, that's the lowest priced Apple watch. Well, it could be, I mean, I guess it could be true
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:11.760]  if you factor in those things that they are, you know, obviously not factoring it,
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:16.240]  the logistics and the capital expenses and things like that. I just don't see how this is
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:21.600]  useful to anybody in any way. Right. Right. Exactly. Other than people trying to, you know,
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:28.240]  what's it called? Muckrake, you know, and, and, you know, seed this perception. And nobody
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:37.200]  ever talks about like the I supply breakdown of the Samsung Galaxy S6. I don't see, I do not see
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:42.240]  the tactic thing called out anywhere here. So it must be embedded in one of these categories,
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:46.640]  which is just to me, I mean, because it's a brand new thing. You can't, right. You can't,
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:51.920]  you can't. I mean, you're obviously just making an estimate. Right. But then then you obviously
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:10:01.040]  don't know. I didn't link to them yet. Hopefully I will before the episode errors. But I saw two
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:05.760]  stories. And I guess I'll put them in the show notes, but that probably means I won't because
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:11.280]  every time I say that, I don't know. But I did write a note down here. Speaking of components,
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:16.800]  I saw a thing that, and the Verge had it Sony reported their results. And they're, they're, you know,
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:20.480]  looks like the company's doing pretty good. And they're expecting the year to be really good.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:26.880]  But the thing that's holding them back, they're losing money on phones. And the gist of the
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:31.360]  Verge story is maybe it's time for Sony to stop making cell phones because they're losing money on it.
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:35.760]  And the company, you know, the things where they're succeeding, like PlayStation's doing pretty well,
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:42.320]  you know, and they're just not, you know, time to give up the ghost on phones.
[1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:48.560]  And I thought it was interesting because the other story I saw was that part of their
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:55.520]  results is that they are making Sony's making like 20 bucks a unit on iPhone 6 and the Galaxy
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:02.080]  S6 because both of them are using Sony cameras. And I'm not quite sure if it's the whole thing,
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:07.120]  the lens and the, the scent. But some part of these phones that have these, you know, these super
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:15.600]  great high-end camera phones are all using Sony optics. And I thought that was really,
[1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:20.000]  really interesting. And to me, it's Sony at its best, you know, and I've, you know, I've always
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:24.720]  been like a fan of Sony. And I know Steve Jobs was, I know a lot of Apple people are just because
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:28.000]  to me, Sony is one of those companies that appeals in the same way that Apple does,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  where they sweat the details and stuff like that. And I think it's so interesting because I saw
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:39.200]  also that Canon had some really bad results, like quarterly results, you know, because camera
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:43.440]  sales are so down. And I thought, you know, it's really interesting because Sony, even though they
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:52.880]  make their own phones, is it was interested in making camera parts for would-be competitors,
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:58.960]  like Apple and Samsung. And Canon, which doesn't make phones, doesn't have any kind of business
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.400]  like that. Yeah. And I know that maybe that's not really a sign of Sony,
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:13.920]  having the, you know, a bill, Sony executives having the four site to be like that. Maybe it's just
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:20.000]  a sign of how divided Sony is as a conglomerate that maybe the people who make the phones,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.920]  it's Sony or pissed that the imaging side of our making them for the phone. But either way,
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:31.200]  it's good for the company. At some point, you know, you know, the buck stops here and Sony as a
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:37.600]  company is doing something pretty smart to stay relevant in a world where people aren't buying
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:44.160]  Sony phones and people are using the phones they are buying from Samsung and Apple to take their
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:51.120]  pictures that they're getting a piece of it. Yeah. So I don't really remember them making cameras.
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:57.760]  Well, they do now, though, because they have a, they bought, they bought Minolta. So Minolta doesn't
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:04.160]  exist anymore. Okay. A couple of years ago, they bought Minolta and they actually make,
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:08.960]  like the Sony cameras are actually excellent. They're some of the really cutting edge stuff.
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:15.440]  They make good SLRs and they're mirrorless ones, you know, these new ones that are like
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:21.120]  basically like in layman's terms, a really good camera that doesn't work anything like an SLR.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:27.840]  Doesn't have any kind of clacking mirror. So it's silent. Some of theirs are just amazing,
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:34.880]  really, really groundbreaking stuff. Okay. I can't think of the last Sony product that I owned
[1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:41.840]  frankly. It's so funny because, you know, after owning them throughout the 80s and, you know,
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:47.840]  it's well into the 90s. It's so funny because I feel like the one of those like anachronisms that
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:57.280]  it's getting ready to pop our mirrored SLR cameras, digital SLRs, you know, like in the way that
[1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:01.440]  like smoking in a restaurant, like you just can't even imagine anymore. Like it stands out to me,
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:05.440]  like that you see it. The only people who really use them anymore, I shouldn't say only,
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:10.960]  but where I really notice it is news media, like super professional high-end news media. So like
[1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:17.360]  President Obama comes out in the Rose Garden to talk about, you know, the news of the day.
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:23.520]  What do you hear? You hear this like machine gun fire of photos. And you never heard it in the old
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:30.560]  days pre digital because there was no point when you were only could put 36 images on a
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:39.680]  roll of film of shooting all 36 images in a second, right? Like, you know, the old way of shooting,
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:44.160]  I'm sure they shot a lot of film. I'm sure that like the newspaper reporters for the major
[1:14:44.160 --> 1:14:49.840]  newspapers, the photographers, I'm sure they shot not the reporters. The photographer shot a lot
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:53.120]  of images compared to like what a consumer would do, but they wouldn't just hold the button
[1:14:53.120 --> 1:14:57.520]  down and let it shoot as fast as it could, whereas now they do. They just shoot and shoot and shoot
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:01.520]  and shoot to get whatever image they want. Just that way out of one special image.
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:06.480]  The noise really started to start into bothering me because like nobody else in the world uses
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:10.000]  these cameras that make noise anymore. Like you go to school events, you don't hear people's
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.840]  cameras clicking anymore. Everybody's cameras are dropped at silent. Do you know where else I
[1:15:15.840 --> 1:15:20.640]  noticed it? I noticed it when I watched that weird baseball game yesterday. The, the,
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:24.480]  oh yeah, the Orioles game. Yeah. So anybody didn't see me linked to it on a
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:32.080]  darn fireball ball. The city of Baltimore is, is having a lot of protests over the police treatment
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:37.440]  of the citizens of Baltimore. Is that a good summary? That's, you know,
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:43.920]  yes. So protests in the streets. The protests got a little ugly over the weekend and it was a
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:48.240]  baseball game Baltimore where, where the fans had a hard time getting out of the stadium because
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:52.960]  they, the fans exiting the ballpark were right there where the protests were and it was night time
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.640]  and it was a little scary. And when the police had also, I don't know if they had, if this was going
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  on at the same time as that, but they had also, they, for several times they shut down the public
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:09.600]  transportation. Yeah, I saw that too, which is so, uh, yeah, if you're leaving a ball game and
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:12.160]  there's no public transportation, it might be a little bit of a cult to get around.
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:16.480]  Yeah. Well, if in Philly, it would be, I mean, there's thousands and thousands of people who come
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:22.880]  to the game in their cars in Philly, but I, I, I, at some huge proportion of every game is
[1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:28.160]  taking the subway home. If they shut down the subway, it would be a nightmare. And it came to
[1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:33.280]  New York, it's probably a better located in Philly. We, we keep our ball parks way down at the end
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.520]  of the city, like everybody has to go somewhere, like, you know, I don't know, it would be,
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:44.480]  if, if public transportation had to be shut down for whatever reason, like a flood or a protest
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:49.920]  or a strike, even if it was just like a, you know, a public transportation worker strike,
[1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:53.600]  I could see, I don't know, maybe they wouldn't, if they had enough notice, they wouldn't cancel
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:59.360]  the game, but I could see how they might have to. So I could see that. Anyway, whether it's well
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:03.280]  intention or not, they played, played a baseball game, professional baseball game yesterday
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.040]  without the public in the stadium. So there was nobody there, except for the team and a couple of
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:14.880]  employees. And I guess the scouts from other teams were allowed to show up. So there were, you know, an empty
[1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:22.400]  a ballpark that fits 50, some 51,000 people had nobody in it. And why I watched the game for an
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.160]  inning or two just to see how weird it was. And it was super weird. And you could hear this.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:36.480]  That's got to be it. I can't imagine what it's like playing that game.
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:43.200]  I can't either. I mean, not only is there, you're, you're losing the enthusiasm of the crowd,
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.680]  but then you have all these noises that you've never heard before. Yeah.
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:54.000]  I never really paid attention to anyway. Right. Like, you know, I don't know, like your, your,
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:59.840]  it must do, I don't know. I haven't seen enough. I saw a lot of people writing about what
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:03.360]  it we had weirdos, but I didn't see a lot of quotes from the players talking about whether it was
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:06.800]  tough, you know, like to keep their concentrate, you know, like if it did it feel real.
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:12.320]  Yeah, I would think I wouldn't, but, you know, it seems like a, like a practice.
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:16.720]  Right. But I just remember thinking like in a regular stadium when, you know, even if that if you're
[1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:20.320]  not a popular team, but the Baltimore Orioles are pretty popular and they, you know, usually have a
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:26.000]  good, really good crowd. Great fans. Doesn't matter what brand camera you have. If you're like a
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.800]  professional photographer, nope, your camera isn't making noise at bothers people, but like,
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:35.680]  and that game it definitely was. And that's like, I think if you're a professional photography
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:40.880]  and if you're a sports photographer, you've kind of got to be an extrovert to some degree,
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:44.480]  where you're walking around with this big camera and a big obtuse of lens and you're taking
[1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:49.120]  people's pictures and you're used to, you know, asking their name so you can get their name or
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.200]  whatever and the rights to use their image. Um, you know, and I'm a little bit more of an introvert.
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:58.320]  I don't want to, you know, I don't, I don't want to be noticed. I, I would have, it would have been
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:03.520]  unbearable to me to be like, behind home plate, clacking my camera, knowing that like the picture
[1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:09.360]  and hitter can hear you. What have driven me nuts. And it didn't matter. And it's like, that's just
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:13.440]  baseball, right? Because something bad is going to happen for one of them. You know, either the guy
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:18.000]  is going to make an out and it's bad for the hitter or the guy is so someone, someone can blame you.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.280]  But what would matter what happened in every that bad? I would be like, Oh, that was me, right?
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:30.960]  Like I made the guy throw a bad pitch or I made the guy strike out. I would have been able to
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:36.160]  stand it. And it's getting, it's getting, there's no technical reason why these guys couldn't use
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:39.920]  mirrorless cameras that you just push the button like your iPhone and it doesn't make enough.
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:49.680]  We actually, you had, um, film developed recently for the first time in 15 years, probably,
[1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:55.760]  um, you know, 12 years, because one of the things that they suggested taking to this fifth grade
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:20:04.400]  camp that I took went with my son to is, uh, was waterproof cameras. Hmm. Um, so Karen bought a couple
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:12.800]  of disposable waterproof cameras, which are still, you know, film based. So you know, and then,
[1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:17.280]  and it's funny getting pictures back and particularly pictures that were taken by an 11 year old.
[1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:22.320]  And the results, you can't, there's a couple of good, there's a couple of good ones, but,
[1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:26.160]  you know, you shot two rules of film and a lot of them are just like, you know, up in the air,
[1:20:28.320 --> 1:20:34.400]  the ground. There's a tree. I've said this for, did your family take a lot of photos grown up?
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:40.320]  No, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't say a lot. I mean, we took, we took a fair number, but nobody was,
[1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:47.360]  uh, I got into, I got into cameras in junior high school. I wish I, that was probably,
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:51.040]  I wish I had. I don't know why I didn't, I honestly got don't know why I didn't,
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:56.480]  I even got super involved at the student newspaper at Drexel in the 90s and never got involved
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:00.320]  in photography. And I have no idea why I didn't, because I, then I would have had a dark,
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:04.800]  I would have had my own dark room and I could have, I could have blown that paper's funds on
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:12.800]  development and for film. Yeah, I did that. So I did, I mean, I took a class in junior high school
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:18.880]  for, I think it was over the summer, it was the summer thing. And, um, yeah, we did, so we did develop,
[1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:23.120]  we developed black and white stuff. I got into pretty cool. I shot film, then for a couple of
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:27.760]  year, I got it. I did get my first like SLR and I did start getting into photography right after
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:32.000]  college. And I immediately thought, why the hell didn't I do this when I was at student newspapers?
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:38.560]  I, they needed me. We always, we're always a desperate need of a decent photographs.
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:45.120]  I'm not, I'm not any good though. I mean, I just, I don't have a very good eye and like my wife
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:49.680]  had just done a much better eyes. So she, she can take better pictures than I can, but, you know,
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:52.800]  I think I learned, I learned a lot and it was kind of it was cool to be able to do that at the
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:58.240]  time. Boy, I missed my pentex came in thousand though. What was that? That was a sweet,
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:02.880]  that was a fully manual camera. Yeah. Oh, God, of course. What was the model name?
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:08.000]  Got stolen Pentex K 1000. Oh, I've seen that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It got stolen.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.840]  And yeah. And for a long time, those were, those were highly coveted because they were used a lot
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:18.960]  in, in photography classes because they were fully manual. Right. And then, you know, that thing
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:23.840]  was a brick too. I mean, it was, it was built like a brick shit house. Pentax always had it,
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:27.440]  maybe they still have. I shouldn't talk about them in the past tense, but although I can't remember
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:30.640]  the last time I heard of somebody buying a Pentex, but I remember Pentex always had a good
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:35.760]  reputation for that the controls were nice, like a photographer's photographer, you know, like,
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:41.600]  what you'd want. Like, if you, if you wanted to change the aperture, you'd want to do it this way,
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:45.600]  and that's how they did it. And, you know, the things that you turned out, a good feel and
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:49.520]  stuff like that. Mm hmm. I still have the, when I got his replacement, which was an ME,
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:56.160]  with a couple lenses, just sitting on a shelf somewhere. My family was not a photography family,
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:23:00.000]  which is probably why I just didn't get the interest in it. Like we, and we joke,
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.840]  like Amy's family was sort of the same way, and we joke, and it's really no exaggeration that
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:12.080]  there are roles of film from like the early 80s that that's undeveloped. No, but that the,
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:17.840]  you know, like 24 exposures and they start at the Jersey Shore on a summer vacation,
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:20.880]  and then they end with me and my sister opening Christmas presents.
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:29.040]  You know, it was like they would, we would take the camera on vacation and then, you know,
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:33.520]  shoot a couple photos at the beach. And, but, you know, we don't want to waste the whole role,
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:38.240]  and then next thing you know, it's Christmas morning and Santa came and it's like, hey, get the camera.
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:46.080]  Someplace I have a role of film that's undeveloped, like, I think it's like dresser or something like that,
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.600]  but you know, you used to, because the films would come in different speeds and, you know,
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:55.440]  and then sometimes they would shoot black and white in color. And so you, you would sometimes take
[1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:01.360]  out a role of film that was not finished, roll it back up into the, into the thing without rolling
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:06.880]  it in all the way. Remember, right on it, how many pictures you had taken, and then you, you could
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:13.840]  put it back in later and go past that to, to use up the rest of the role. And so I have one of those,
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:19.440]  that's, it's, I'm sure it's been lying around. I think it, I think it even been lying around like
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:26.480]  long before I switched to digital. So it's probably from like the early 90s or something like that.
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:31.280]  I have no idea what's on it. I'm not, it's still not developed. I should probably do it before
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:36.480]  all development goes away completely. It was, it was the worst. Even, and when I got into shooting
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:41.360]  film, it, you know, I wasn't, you know what I mean? Water, money runs through my hands like water.
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:46.800]  I mean, I was never afraid to, you know, if the days event that I wanted to photograph,
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:52.560]  I shot 20 exposures. I didn't give too much of a care about, well, let's take four pictures of,
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:58.240]  I don't know. But you do, you did have that sense though that every time you press the
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:03.040]  shutter, you were spending like, you're spending some kind of money, you know, like 25 cents,
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:06.560]  25 cents, 25 cents. And that's even if you're just like getting them developed at like,
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:11.360]  you know, the drugstore or whatever. Yeah. Anything you get them back in their crappy, just be furious.
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:18.640]  Right. And I remember I used to shoot Kodak, I loved Kodak Tri-X. And I wasn't, again, I was super
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:26.240]  super, you know, casually into film photography. I mean, there's so many people who know way,
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:30.960]  way more about black and white film than me. But Tri-X to me was neat because it was super friendly
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:36.160]  to a not so good photographer at a wide range. It was ISO 400 so you could use it in pretty low
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:42.160]  light. And it just tended to have this high contrast black and white look that I really, really liked.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:47.760]  And it's so funny to me in the years since I think about it too, where I would just pop
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:53.440]  Tri-X into my camera and go out and shoot photos. And again, I don't really have a great eye.
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:56.880]  I don't think there's any chance that I was ever going to, you know, be a professional photographer in
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.360]  any sense. You know, I'm lucky if I got, you know, out of 24, if I got two or three interesting shots.
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.720]  And never was really good at looking at the real world around me in color and trying to figure out
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:11.440]  what would look good in high contrast black and white. But then you just take it to the place and then
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:16.720]  they give you your 24 things and it'd be like, man, these photos look so cool. And you know,
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:23.600]  like people's faces, it would be like, you know, the right mix of light and dark. And then
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:27.600]  knowing in hindsight, like when you take color photograph and go into Photoshop or anything,
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.640]  how tricky it is to make a really cool high contrast black and white mix. Whereas the film,
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.520]  it just happened. It just, you know, automatic.
[1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:38.080]  Yeah.
[1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:42.480]  You're black and white. It was like a white manner you shoot color.
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:48.240]  I was black and white for a long time. I mean, I mostly, well, for a long period of us,
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:52.400]  I was shooting just black and white. So from that point where I took that class in
[1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:57.280]  junior high school through, probably through college, I think I shot all black and white.
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:01.440]  And then when I went to Japan, so I guess like in my junior year in college, I went to Japan,
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:09.760]  I wanted to shoot in color while it was there. So that's probably about when I switch. But then
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:12.240]  I, you know, on and off, I would still, I would still shoot black and white.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:18.080]  All right, let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. And they've sponsored the show before,
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:26.400]  but not for a long time. It's our good friend at Audible, a U D I B L E, the ebook or that
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.120]  you book the audio book company, largest selection of audio books in the world.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:41.600]  They have over 180,000 titles. New titles probably every week, maybe every day. I don't even know.
[1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:49.440]  You can just sign up and subscribe and start downloading audio books instantly.
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:56.240]  A long time sponsor of podcasts for the obvious reason that if you're listening to me talk to
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:02.480]  you right now, you are the sort of person who listens to people talking on a thing. And maybe
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:09.520]  you have a commute, maybe you listen to podcasts while you work, maybe you do it while you exercise,
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:15.280]  who knows. But you're obviously listening to spoken word content. And that is what Audible has.
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:21.680]  Long-form books, real books, and a great deal. And so if you consume lots of podcasts,
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:26.800]  if you're the sort of person who wishes that I came out with more podcasts and you love it when
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:34.400]  my podcast run long and you need more stuff, if you haven't looked at Audible and ebooks for
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:41.360]  high quality content, well, you should because it's amazing. It's, you know, I'm going to say
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.760]  literally, and I think I actually mean literally, literally not literally in the new sense that
[1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:54.160]  means figuratively a library of book length content, 180,000 of them from all the top
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:29:00.000]  broadcasters, publishers, entertainers, and more. And you can go there is the thing, you can go
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:07.040]  and get a free audio book of your choice and a free 30 day trial membership. So I'm not even
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:13.760]  going to ask you to spend money. You can just go there. You got to go to audiblepodcast.com,
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:20.080]  a-u-d-i-b-l-e, podcast.com. That's their domain slash the talk show. They've got the
[1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:25.760]  the in this look, audiblepodcast.com slash the talk show. Go there and you get a free book,
[1:29:26.560 --> 1:29:29.680]  you get a 30 day membership where you can download all sorts of other stuff to listen to.
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:34.480]  And there's the, they always want the host of the show to pick a book, which I was going to,
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:39.760]  I was going to ask, I was going to ask. But this time is such good timing. I is no brainer,
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:44.800]  totally easy, no brainer, uh, becoming Steve Jobs, the evolution of a reckless upstart into a
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:50.000]  visionary leader. That's the book that came out a few weeks ago, uh, I think a march by, uh,
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:56.160]  Brent Schlender and Rick Tedzelli. Uh, and I've been writing about it on during fireball a few
[1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:02.480]  times. I interviewed those guys on stage in New York to talk about it. Uh, last month, uh,
[1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:06.800]  I just think it's not a perfect book. It is not. And I know like Jason Snow and, uh,
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:09.600]  a few other people have brought up some of the things and some of the things are just
[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.360]  they could have been caught with like a technical editor, because it's just stupid stuff.
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.120]  Like getting the name of certain max wrong or certain technical details. Like,
[1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:20.800]  because these guys are, they're business writers and they're writing about Apple as a business
[1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:25.040]  and they're not writing about it from the get all the details right. And I know people like me,
[1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:30.720]  it's annoying when you see a stupid technical error in there. Um, I get annoyed when people don't,
[1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:34.320]  you know, capitalize mac world, right. And I think that they capitalize mac world. Yeah, they,
[1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:41.520]  they came up case. Right. So I, I know, I know, but seriously, the book is like 99% great. And
[1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:48.080]  it has some really, really good original stuff, um, that nobody else has ever had. It has a really
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:55.600]  neat personal touch. And it has a long term view on jobs as business life, because Brent Schlender
[1:30:55.600 --> 1:31:00.480]  had been writing about him and talking about him and, and part of his life and, you know, it's
[1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:07.200]  visited him in his home every couple of years for decades. Um, it's a tremendous. I think this is
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:13.200]  great, uh, personally, it's an unabridged audiobook, 16 hours, 21 minutes. So you're not missing
[1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:17.120]  a damn thing. So if you haven't read that book yet and you love books, go there, they've got it,
[1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:23.440]  you could do this as the, uh, uh, as you're free with 30 day trial membership book,
[1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:29.760]  becoming Steve Jobs by, uh, Brent Schlender and Rick Titzelli. So my thanks to Audible. And again,
[1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:36.640]  the URL is audible podcast.com slash the talk show. I see in their homepage, the, on the main page,
[1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:42.880]  they have the Martian, which is a really good book that, uh, I just finished reading with my son.
[1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:49.360]  And, um, he's, you know, he likes, he's not crazy about reading novels for some reason. He
[1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:55.120]  really likes reading, uh, nonfiction and tends to do that. So we were trying to get him into
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.320]  novels in the way I got him into this was like told him there was a lot of swearing in it.
[1:31:59.680 --> 1:32:04.160]  And there is, there's a lot, there's a fair amount of swearing in it. And, uh, but it's very funny.
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:10.880]  And there's no, there's no bad violence. There's no crazy sexual situations in it. Um, it's,
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:16.880]  there's a lot of hard science fiction and some, some swearing that he found quite amusing. So,
[1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:21.840]  uh, we plowed through that together and he really enjoyed that. So I think it's a, it's a really
[1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:26.800]  good book. Hard science fiction about a man mission to Mars. Yes. I get, I get stuck in. It's
[1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:32.880]  becoming a movie. I think coming out in the fall, I'm not mistaken with Matt Damon. There you go.
[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:40.240]  I saw Matt Damon. I saw him stranded on a planet already. Well, guess he's getting tight cast.
[1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:43.440]  Yeah. He's a much nicer guy in this one though.
[1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:50.240]  Oh, they've got the game of throne stuff. All that. So anyway, thanks to Audible, the I
[1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:55.520]  honestly got you could consume your entire life listening to Audible books. Uh, sorry. What
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:32:59.360]  else is going on? What else we got? Where do we talk about earnings? What was the other,
[1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:07.040]  what was the other, do we do both the links that you saw me? Uh, oh, that it goes into earnings,
[1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:13.120]  where it's all over the idea in the iPad. So Apple reported earnings and, uh, iPhone is
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:20.560]  gazinga. It's going nuts. They're like the most seriously. It's it's insane. How often can you say
[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:27.760]  it? But it's seriously it's probably the single most popular and successful product in the history
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:34.480]  of like modern manufacturing. Yeah. And some people kind of use that as a club because they say
[1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:39.520]  that Apple's solely an iPhone company now and that's their big problem because if boy,
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:43.280]  if something happens to the iPhone, like something is just going to happen to the iPhone,
[1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:49.120]  then they'll be in big trouble. So look out. Well, I do, you know, and there was a New York Times
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:52.560]  ride. I don't even want to put it in the show notes because it was so stupid. It was like, uh,
[1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:59.280]  can Apple stay on top forever? Apple can't stay on top forever. Just ask IBM and it was just
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:03.920]  stupid, stupid article because it didn't even say that just the whole article could have been
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:08.160]  replaced with what goes up must come down. And I don't know that there's anybody who's arguing
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:14.720]  that Apple will remain the biggest company forever because, I mean, it's, you know, the heat
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.040]  death of the universe is imminent. Right? I mean, something's going to happen. Eventually,
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.840]  like, tell me, give me something. It was like a lot of people pointed to me on Twitter and like,
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.040]  can't wait for the claim shelter on this, but it's actually claim child or proof because he
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:30.320]  didn't say anything that could ever be disproven. He didn't say five years from now.
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.920]  Yeah. Yeah. Five years from now, Apple will not be the biggest company or 10 years from now.
[1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:38.000]  Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, trip, childry. You're right, trip, childry. 60 days.
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.560]  True. That's, you know, that's a good point though. That, that, that, let's hear it for trip,
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:50.960]  childry, at least trip, childry, putting a line in the sand. Right. He's his trip, childry's thing
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:56.240]  was a year ago that Apple had to, uh, what was it? Well, he is a whole out of them, actually,
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:59.360]  but yeah, I think the one that you're thinking of. They needed to come out with a bigger
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:04.640]  phone within 60 days or, or a surveillance. Yes, that they would go into permanent decline.
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.520]  Yeah. And they missed his 60 day period by at least five or six months.
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:16.880]  And still seem to be doing okay. Yeah. That at least, again, give it to him. He was
[1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:23.520]  incredibly wrong, terribly sensationalist, shamelessly making a statement in my opinion that he
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:30.800]  probably, he either has brain damage or, you know, a substance problem, or he knew exactly what
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:35.760]  he was saying and just knew that it would get quoted, which is my theory is that a lot of these guys
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:39.760]  like him and Rob Enderley and everybody always asked me, what is with these guys? And I,
[1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:44.320]  my answer is, I think the answer is what they're good at is they're good at getting their name
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:49.600]  out there and being quoted because, and then that leads to consulting work because people say,
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:54.000]  Rob Enderley, I've seen you on TV and I've seen you quoted in the New York Times. You must be smart.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:36:00.080]  I will hire you. And I think they ever in for a big surprise. Never. Yeah. You know, I met him.
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:06.880]  You met Enderley? Yeah, almost. Oh, well, I, I did. I, did you met him almost?
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:11.840]  Well, yeah, I chickened out. Okay. I don't think I could do it either.
[1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:15.840]  When I was in San Francisco, I have not told this story. He's a good story. When I was in San
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:24.160]  Francisco last September for the iPhone event, I believe it was the iPhone might have been the iPad
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:33.120]  in October, but it was iPhone. The next day, T mobile had an event right there in San Francisco,
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:38.000]  right there on Market Street. I think it, you and I have been there. It's that the bar that looks
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:44.400]  like an old, it's supposed to be like an old newspaper, you know, like five late edition or
[1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:49.520]  something like that early edition. Oh, that sounds familiar. I can't picture. I can't picture it.
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:54.240]  Let me see if there's a bar in San Francisco called early edition or maybe there there was because
[1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:59.760]  they bars in San Francisco, tend to have a show. Yeah, right. But they rented the whole place out
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:06.160]  early edition, local edition, local edition. Yeah, local edition. So anybody who's interested
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:12.400]  and knows it's a 691 Market Street. So they the T mobile rented out local edition. It's a pretty
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:18.240]  big bar for a cocktail bar. And John Legeer, what's this last? How do you say his name?
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:23.680]  Leger. Leger. You know, it was announcing, I think, I don't know, like their new unlimited plan
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:27.120]  or something like that. They invited me and I never would have gone in a thousand years except
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:30.320]  for the fact that I was already in San Francisco and they didn't have to change any of my travel
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:34.080]  plans. So I thought, screw it. I don't know, you know, act like a real, you know, somebody who covers
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:39.760]  stuff like this and I'll go. And I had a fun time. But while I was standing in line with New Quinn,
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:44.080]  I realized that Rob Enderley was right behind me in line. Like he was the person behind me. I was
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:52.160]  talking to, uh, uh, just, I forget who I was talking to from the verge. Somebody from the verge
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:55.920]  was right in front of me. Deaterbone was right in front of me. And I was talking to him. We were
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.240]  talking about the phone, you know, the iPhone. And I realized Rob Enderley was right behind me.
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:03.680]  And I really thought about introducing myself because I think I could pull it off.
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:09.920]  But my worry was that maybe he has no idea who I am. And I didn't know how to, I didn't know how
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:15.920]  to do. And it, it wasn't like I got real shy and, and just totally chickened out. And I, I'm
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:23.680]  willing to face up for the number of times I have called him a jackass. But it would, I couldn't
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:30.720]  figure out a way to do it with playing both sides of the table of it's okay. Because, you know,
[1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:35.280]  I mean, like I'm always, so for example, I always run into this one. I go into an Apple retail store
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:41.040]  is a lot of times I go in and the people who help me when they realize who I am, they,
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.640]  they acknowledge it. And they're like, Oh, I, I love your site. Um, like there are obviously trained
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:50.400]  in the Apple stores. It's a funny thing. Like I'm not a celebrity, but in an Apple store, I'm a
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:55.680]  celebrity. Um, they're trained that if you recognize somebody, don't make a deal out of it.
[1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:59.520]  You know, so like if a true like the mayor comes in, they're supposed to treat the mayor like a
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:04.560]  regular customer. So they, it's never uncomfortable, you know, but other times it is clear that the
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:09.280]  person who's checking me out at the Apple store has no idea who I am, which is totally cool. I don't
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:21.200]  care. I don't want to be. I'd better. Um, but sometimes it comes up like, um, I, I bought, uh,
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:27.920]  Jonas's, uh, because again, I'm a procrastinator, uh, instead of ordering it online, I bought Jonas's
[1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:37.280]  uh, MacBook Air on in the retail store. And, um, because I was getting close to Christmas,
[1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:42.320]  I couldn't trust the shipping. So, um, I went in to buy it and the guy, I was like, this is what
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:46.960]  I want to buy. I want to buy this. And, uh, actually it's a MacBook Pro. I still have corrected
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:51.840]  because he wants to play Minecraft. Um, so anyway, I went in to buy a MacBook Pro and I knew exactly
[1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:55.440]  what I wanted. Uh, and I knew they had it. And I said, this is why I went by. And the guys started
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.920]  giving me, well, what do you do? What do you, you know, what are you going to use before?
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:05.360]  And I didn't want to tell them what I did. Just, just give me the platform. Because it was,
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:11.120]  I, I, it's like, well, I write a site where about Apple, it just seemed to me like, you know,
[1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:15.040]  uh, if I said that, then it would be like, I'm implying you're supposed to know I am. And I
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:18.000]  don't think you're supposed to know I am. But anyway, I couldn't figure out how to do it with
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.480]  interlay and play both sides of the street where it would be like, oh, we finally meet.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:27.040]  Yeah, right. Right. Maybe I looked in. He's not, yeah, he's not expecting to
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:31.200]  right to have that moment. Yeah, right. But on the other hand, I wouldn't be sorry. I wouldn't be
[1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:34.720]  surprised if he has no idea. It never hurt me. Never heard of anything. Because I think he's,
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:39.200]  you know, he's so monomalized, maniacally focused on getting quoted by, like, the New York Times
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:43.440]  and getting on CNN and stuff like that that, you know, my little thing that doesn't even
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.200]  be. Well, he also just lives, he lives in a completely different world. Yes, exactly. He lives in
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:54.000]  a, he lives in a PC world. So he's not, you know, he, I, yeah, he probably does not keep up on,
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  on our movements. Right. Like, for example, uh, also have never met him, but, um, uh,
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:11.120]  what's his name, uh, Windows guy? Oh, uh, yeah. Right. Yeah, throw it. Paul, throw it. Never
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:17.760]  met him. Almost met him last year when I was out at Microsoft's build conference, um, I was at
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:21.440]  the same like after party and I thought about going over it, but it's just real crowded and he
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:26.240]  was talking to somebody like I, I didn't, I wouldn't hesitate to introduce myself to him and I've
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:30.160]  linked to him sometimes complimentary. Sometimes I've agreed with him, but a lot of times over the
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.840]  years, I've linked to him, you know, in a disagreement, let's say. Sure. Um, but I wouldn't hesitate
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:40.720]  to introduce myself to him, but I, I know that he knows who I am. So the, at least the context is
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:48.560]  there. He at least, I mean, you know, I don't think that every post that he makes, uh, shows this,
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:53.120]  but he at least is a guy who I know is smart. Yes. Yeah. I totally agree. Whereas with
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  Enderleigh, I didn't know, I know you're generally, you know, I don't know what that guy's deal is.
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:03.120]  I kind of regret it though. And hindsight, I regret that I didn't figure. I think the way to play it
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:08.400]  in hindsight would have been to just over emphasize the humble part and just assume that he has no
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:12.480]  idea and say, Hey, I'm my name's John Gruber. I write a site where I write about technology, uh,
[1:42:13.040 --> 1:42:18.240]  yeah. But then why am I introducing him me to you? That's the thing I couldn't get over is
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:23.280]  if I play it like that, like, as though I don't expect him to know who I am, then I don't see the
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:28.080]  point of me introducing myself to him because really the point would be. Right. So there's
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:31.840]  just the solution that my wife and I have come up to come up with in situations like that is just
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:40.480]  to touch the person. So we went to, we went to found pen and teller, we went to teller one time
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:45.280]  and, uh, you know, there's in the intermission they come out into the lobby, at least they used to,
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:49.920]  this was a long time ago. Um, and they just like, they mill around a lobby and talk to people. And,
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:54.560]  and she's like, and we were with a bunch of friends. We were like, oh, she would go, she would
[1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:57.760]  go talk to him. And I'm like, I'm not in the state. Why am I going to sign up? I'm nothing to say to
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:04.800]  the, the, uh, pendulate. Right. And, uh, it's so my wife just goes, well, I'm just going to go
[1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:11.280]  touch him. So she just walks up to him and she just like, pokes him in the arm and then just walks
[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:16.240]  away. He's talking to somebody. He didn't even look at her. He just kept talking to the person
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:23.440]  and walked away. So like, years later, I met, I met Mac world, the conference and I see Ron Johnson
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:27.840]  on the floor. And I was like, hi, there's just a Sean Johnson is like, he's a, you know,
[1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:32.960]  Apple executives. Like, I had a retail. Like, I was with a friend and I'm like, I'm going to go touch
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:38.400]  him. So I just walked up to Ron Johnson. Same thing, exact same thing. He's talking to some guy,
[1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:43.040]  I poke him in the arm and I walk away. He doesn't look at me, nothing. Just like,
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:47.920]  I touched Ron Johnson. John, you've told me a lot of weird stories over the years.
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:54.560]  I'm sure I told, I must have told you that. No, that's crazy. It's crazy that you walk away
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:58.320]  without expecting. Like, I really thought you were going to say, like, you put your hand on the
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:02.960]  shoulder and wait for them to look at you and then now you just like, because it's the, that's
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:06.320]  that thing though. It's like, I've really got nothing. I mean, it might be interested to talk to them
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:10.720]  for a while, but I don't, you know, I don't know how to, I don't know how to approach that. I don't
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:15.760]  know. We had one of my, hi, I wrote a stupid website there. I mean, what's a call to be that
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:23.200]  website? I don't want to be right. Obviously, I'm an idiot. He doesn't want to talk to me. So
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:31.520]  plus, I probably wrote something on cars, even like, so crazy though, but my second thought,
[1:44:31.520 --> 1:44:37.360]  though, is that it's, it's a sign that, that you married right, that you and your wife both agree
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:42.000]  that this is, that's the method. That's the way you do in those situations. You just touched the
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:46.160]  person. You've made, you've made contact and that's it. That's all you needed, right?
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:53.280]  Very, very funny. I think more, you know, more people should do that instead of making
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:57.440]  fools out of themselves, right? Oh, where were we? We got sidetracked. We were talking about the iPad
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:08.800]  though. Yeah, right. So all right, iPhone was a successful product in history. Mac is doing better,
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:15.840]  but it's like a, you know, it, it looks like a successful product in a very established category,
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:21.200]  which is exactly what it is. Where doing well is very, very stable and the growth while
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:26.160]  sloping upward, which is what a company wants to see, it's sloping upward at a very, very gentle
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:31.440]  slope. Right. Whereas well, but while the rest of that, that category is going down.
[1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:35.840]  Down. So it's been going down. Yeah. And so if, yeah, the most impressive thing, perhaps about the
[1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:42.240]  Mac is it's, it, not it's slope compared to zero, but it's slope compared to the PC industry as a
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:46.720]  whole, which always confuses me too, because is that PC industry as a whole, including Apple?
[1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:54.640]  Or is it, does it, oh, and does it mean Windows PCs? Because Apple sells enough
[1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:59.520]  Macs now where that actually makes it difficult. It should fix the curve. Yeah, I don't know.
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:03.680]  But anyway, they sell, you know, the industry's in decline and the Mac is a general, right?
[1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:09.440]  So that's good. And then there's the iPad, which has a very, very weird and quite, you know,
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:16.240]  frankly, if you like the iPad or if you, you know, own Apple stock or whatever, you know,
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:23.760]  it worries some, perhaps, because it's in decline. And I will put this in the show, and I just
[1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:29.520]  linked to it on Darren Fireball before we started recording, but Dr. Drang had a really good post
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:34.640]  about how to visualize this, you know, and he pointed out that the way, the, the simple way of
[1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:39.680]  pointing it out where you just show this quarter, that quarter, this quarter, that quarter, that quarter
[1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:46.400]  and unit sales is, it disguises the trends because it's so skewed by the holiday quarters,
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:52.720]  which are even more skewed for the iPad the last few years because that's also the quarter
[1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:56.880]  when the new ones come out. Like there's two reasons for there to be a burst in iPad sales, new
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:47:03.120]  iPads come out and people buy them for the holidays. And ever since they switched to unveiling
[1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:09.040]  in October, that's the same quarter. So that one quarter a year has a spike. So he's using moving
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:16.640]  averages to show the, you know, each quarter is trailing four quarters average, which is a common
[1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:23.120]  thing in financial. Yeah, it's not a way to modeling. It's not a way to make it look good or bad.
[1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:29.680]  It's a way to make it to make the trend, the actual underlying trend visible. Like I would say
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:34.480]  that the, the easy way of doing it isn't making it look good or bad. It just is sort of
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:41.760]  noisy. Apple's way, which he points out, which is to only show cumulative sales is let's face
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:50.080]  it sort of a euphemistic chart because cumulative always goes up. And this, you know, this moving
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:54.560]  average type thing, you can really see that there is, it's not just that that's flattened,
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:02.240]  but that they're actually in decline. Right. Um, but that said, still it's a product that sold
[1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:10.240]  13 million units last quarter. It's not exactly a failure. And is that well, so is the tablet market
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:18.000]  down as well? Yeah, the tablet market is down as well. It is. Um, and there is a reader, I'll just
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:21.840]  quote it because I thought, well, I've been trying to word it myself and I can't say it any better
[1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:26.800]  than this. But his explanation was, and I, he didn't link to me, but I've had this thing that
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:31.920]  it's, there's, there's a sort of durability explanation that people have bought iPads and they're
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:37.280]  still using the ones that they already had. Um, and I'm not trying to justify, I'm not trying to
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:41.760]  spin it in any way, but I'm just trying to, you know, but I do think that's true. And I know this
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:46.960]  firsthand from like family members who have relatively old iPads, everything other than the original
[1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:52.720]  iPad is a totally credible iPad today. The original, which my dad still uses because he
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:59.920]  refuses to spend anything on anything. Um, but suffers because of it. It's really, really hard to
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:04.560]  use. And I forget the late, it's like, I still run the iOS five or something like that. Yeah.
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:12.320]  Yeah. My father-in-law has that too. Um, but the iPad too, which is a long time ago, that's a
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:21.440]  2011 device is fundamentally the same internal specs as the current $249 iPad mini. It's
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:26.640]  right. You know, the non retiniscrain, it's the same a what for processor or whatever it was, a
[1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:33.440]  sick a five or whatever. It's an old processor, same lower amount of RAM. Um, it, so it's a
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:39.760]  effectively a 2011 iPad two, which was expensive is the same as the $249 iPad, you can go in
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:44.000]  iPad mini, you can go and buy today. Um, now I'm not saying that's a great experience. I'm guessing
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:52.320]  it's not a great experience with iOS eight, but it's still there. Um, but anyway, Dr. Drank, kind of,
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:56.720]  um, it depends on what you're using it for though because my wife has, has one that, you know,
[1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:02.640]  we bought when they came out and she mostly uses it for reading, which of course, so it's course
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:06.800]  that's perfectly fine, but she, I mean, she'll play, you know, all tells adventure. She plays a few,
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:12.560]  a few simple games. She's not, she's not playing, you know, like unreal engine. Right.
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:19.600]  She's not playing anything that's heavy duty graphical. Can I tell you? Yeah, I have never even
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:25.600]  looked at alto's adventure yet. I came here and feel like just like the third time on a podcast
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:29.360]  in last week that I've heard somebody mention it as the one of those things that like you just
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:35.200]  assume everybody knows. Like the ATP guys talk about it is, you know, it's like all they talk about.
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.920]  It's a good, it's a good game. What kind of, what kind of a game is it? It's like, um, did you
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:44.320]  ever play? Oh, what's that with the one with the not angry birds put the one with the, uh,
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:51.280]  flap and have flappy wings, flappy birds. Now the one, uh, is it a flappy bird? What is the
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:56.800]  flappy bird one with it? It's one with the birds like they go over hills. Oh, I go down.
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:01.600]  I got tiny wings, tiny wings. Yeah, tiny wings. Yeah, I've got it. Um, it's a bit like, it's a bit
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:08.720]  like that. Um, except instead of pressing to go down, you press to make jumps. So you're a snowboarder
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.920]  and you have to do all these different kinds of jumps and jump over things and also like pick up
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:21.200]  things and, uh, and then escape from someone's chasing you. Uh, but it's good. It's, it's visually
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:26.400]  very nice. And the music is nice. And it's just a very well made game.
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:33.920]  Yeah, I probably wouldn't like that. Yeah, no one to blame, but yourself. Um, anyway, one of his,
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:40.080]  in an update to Dr. Drang's post, he quotes a reader of his Ben Packard, um, who thinks that his
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:44.480]  durability explanation, Drang sort of said this durability thing is nonsense. Well, not that it's
[1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:49.680]  nonsense, but he kind of brushed it off earlier. And this guy says that the Mac, he, the, and
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:53.520]  because Drang's argument is why doesn't that apply to the Mac as well. And this guy says the Mac has
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:58.000]  been around long enough for there to be substantial numbers of owners at every stage of ownership.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:03.440]  In other words, they have a brand new one. They have a medium aged one middle aged one or they
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:08.960]  have an old Mac that's ready to be replaced. Um, and I would also say too that the Mac's been around
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:16.080]  long enough that ownership is evenly distributed among people like, uh, idiots like me who buy new stuff
[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:23.200]  every couple of years and people like my dad who will use an iMac until it breaks. Right. Um,
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:28.720]  and that the iPad isn't like that at all for the iPad, uh, lots and lots of iPad users are still
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:33.440]  on their first iPad. And so we haven't gotten, you know, it'll take years before it evens out and
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.080]  smooths out. Right. And that people who want to have a new iPad every year or two because they're
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:44.720]  playing high in games, uh, will be smoothed out compared to people who just read novels on their iPad
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:48.480]  and played gentle games, you know, and stuff like that. Yeah. And whatever the long-term replacement
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:52.720]  cycle of iPads turns out to be, we're still in the first one. We're still in the first replacement
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:57.760]  cycle for too many of the variations. And I think that that's true. Um, but the other thing though is
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:05.040]  that Apple kind of contributes to this by, like you said, the making the low-end model last year's
[1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:11.440]  model or, or in this case, the model from several years ago. So now, you know, I mean, if you're a
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:17.440]  developer and you want to code something, you want to, I mean, I, and I know a lot of developers
[1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:24.480]  are complaining about this because they don't want to have to code to these older iPads because
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:29.680]  it's, you know, things, not that powerful anymore. Yeah. But they still, but they still feel that
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:38.080]  need to do that. So, you know, by selling, by continuing to sell those older, you know, the ones
[1:53:38.080 --> 1:53:45.520]  with the older internals, they're making the developers try and still make those viable machine
[1:53:45.520 --> 1:53:51.920]  viable devices. Clearly, I'm not that keyed into the game industry. I would say almost famously
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:58.240]  so at this point, but, um, it doesn't take a gamer to know that games are sort of at the forefront
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:03.920]  of that where games are the sort of apps that most want to take advantage of the latest and
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:11.520]  greatest hardware and things like metal and stuff like that that only, you know, only applies to
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:17.280]  the latest hardware that first, you know, the new generation hardware and Apple works against that
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.280]  in a couple of ways, not just by selling those things, but the way the app store set up and they,
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:28.160]  it's not, you can't just submit an app and say it only runs on the iPad Air 2, even if that's
[1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:33.040]  the truth. And so you see these apps and games where there's like a warning, you know, they actually
[1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:40.400]  have to put like a warning in the description. It's like, if you owned an iPad mini, you know, or
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:46.240]  whatever, if you own any of these iPads, uh, don't don't buy this game. Yeah, which is a really
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:54.480]  weird thing. Like that would get, uh, people get mad. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, you know, I just
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:58.240]  bought this iPad and I can't play this game on it. It's ridiculous. Well, you know, yeah. And then
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:03.040]  what do they do? They give comments on the app store. You're right. Right. And it starts a very,
[1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:08.160]  very bad circle. It just goes to show that they're, you know, Apple's obviously not going to switch
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:14.960]  to it, but there is a certain, certain beauty to the console game model where they just say,
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:20.000]  okay, here is a generation product, the PS4. And we are going to sell this thing for five or
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.240]  six years, maybe more. I think maybe the generations are getting a little older. But, and then
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:30.880]  when you go by a game, the game just real big right up in the corner says PS4. And then you know
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:36.160]  that that game will run as it was expected to run on the PS4 that you have hooked up to your TV.
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:40.640]  And I know, yes, there's different models. And then you could, you know, I guess PS4 isn't like that,
[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:43.920]  but with previous one, some of them had bigger hard drives into it. But for the most part, you know,
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:49.360]  you knew what you knew what the target was going to be. So I don't know. What do you think is going
[1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:53.440]  on with the iPad? Yeah. I mean, I just think it's, I think, well, I think that,
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:01.200]  I mean, I do think it's the durability to at least a certain degree. I think, and I don't know
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:08.240]  of durability is the right word. I go back, it's like a legacy. I go back to the way that Apple
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:14.320]  framed the unveiling in 2010. And, you know, going back to the audible read that the, you know,
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:22.320]  the chair that was on the stage that Steve Jobs sat on in the becoming Steve Jobs, they say,
[1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.320]  although the sourcing on that was a little, it wasn't quite clear because nobody quite said it,
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:30.800]  but they made it pretty clear from there reporting that part of the reason for the chair was to
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:35.360]  show the iPad in the context they wanted to show it, which was sitting back rather than sitting
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:41.360]  forward. But it was also a concession to Jobs's physical stamina that, you know, he couldn't stand
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:47.680]  for two hours. But I do, I think fundamentally though, that there was something to that that they
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:53.440]  picked the right way to frame it, which was there was no device on the market that was meant for
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:57:00.640]  use handheld sitting back, whether you're sitting back in a chair or on a couch or laying on the
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:05.840]  bed, or, you know, and let, you know, see it every time I get on an airplane, sitting on the
[1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:11.200]  airplane seat, sitting back, holding something in your hand, which is the traditional form factor
[1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:17.920]  of a book or magazine, right, compared to something like a laptop that is meant to be laid flat
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:25.760]  on a desk while you sit forward. You should see my son, you're still laptop. He tucks the edge of it
[1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.720]  under, he'll lie down on the couch and he will tuck the edge, the front edge of it under his chin.
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:38.560]  I've seen that. I have seen that as well. I've seen it. But yeah, I think it was part, yes.
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:43.200]  The form factor was not meant, is not conducive to those things. And so I think there was this
[1:57:43.200 --> 1:57:51.840]  enormous untapped market. And it also coincided coming three years after the iPhone and what,
[1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:59.600]  almost 10 years after the iPod with finally, and I mean, you know, in real sense, finally mass
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:07.920]  market awareness of Apple products, you know, and affinity for them, that there was this huge
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.280]  untapped market because there had never been a product that meant to fit it and that over
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:20.160]  inflated the early years of iPad sales. Right. Yeah. And I really don't think that was, that was
[1:58:20.160 --> 1:58:26.000]  definitely affected as well. Right. It was just untapped because like even, you know, the 11-inch air,
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.960]  which maybe at the time was like the closest thing anybody had to do at iPad like device just wasn't
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:36.720]  good in any of those physical contexts. You know, right. I kind of wonder if the large screen
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:42.160]  iPhones will go through the same thing. Ah, that's because there has been, there has been so
[1:58:42.160 --> 1:58:47.680]  much pent-up demand for that form factor. And they're getting a bunch of people who are switching
[1:58:47.680 --> 1:58:52.960]  because they wanted an iPhone all along, but they wanted a big iPhone. And now they've got one
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:58.960]  and it'll be interesting to see what happens from here on out. I mean, I doubt that they'll have
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:04.880]  problems, you know, like serious problems. I've had like problems, but, you know, I wonder if the growth
[1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:11.120]  will not quite what it was. I do, I think that there might be some potential. Like one thing with the,
[1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:21.520]  with the iPhone that is remarkable is that they've never had a year over year. Not even a drop
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:28.000]  though. I don't even think it's ever stayed flat. Every single year has been year over year increase
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.040]  in sales. And for the first couple of years, now this was truly unsustainable. I know that the
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:36.480]  people have said a lot of the growth, you know, Apple and growth is unsustainable. It has to,
[1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:43.360]  you know, a lot of large numbers, blah, blah, blah, stop. The first few years, each successive
[1:59:43.360 --> 1:59:48.320]  generation of iPhone not only sold more than one before it, it sold more than all previous generations
[1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:55.600]  combined. I think that was true up until like the iPhone 4 or maybe even 4S that like the iPhone 4
[1:59:55.600 --> 2:00:00.160]  sold more than the original, the 3G and the 3G S combined and the 3G S it sold more than the
[2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:06.800]  original and 3G combined and the 3G it sold more than the original, you know, like remarkable growth.
[2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:11.360]  Obviously that was not sustainable. That was, at that sort of pace, it would, you'd very quickly
[2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:17.680]  run out of people on the planet, you know, but it still is growing. But I do wonder if you're
[2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:23.520]  right though that like, there's so much pent-up demand for a quote big iPhone that was exactly
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:27.920]  like that. Maybe it's suppressed sales for a few years beforehand and now people, you know, now they've
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:34.400]  got it and they're happy with it and it still, it might take a few cycles to fully flush out.
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:39.680]  Right. And then maybe, and then maybe there's some other thing that will, you know, come up with
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:47.680]  the jam and to reinvigorate again. Yeah. I think by then, by then, everyone will want to go back
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:57.440]  to small phones. I think that it will, I think it'll go, I think that the first sign will be that
[2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:03.840]  the high-end sales level off because it's going to reach, I do think that it'll have, it has to
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.400]  happen eventually and they're got to be getting closer to it and that the growth will come by making
[2:01:09.120 --> 2:01:15.440]  more and better lower end iPhones to expand the market, you know, into other countries with
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:22.000]  lower incomes and stuff like that. Yeah. But that which will overall though, it might keep growing
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:28.720]  the number of users, but it's going to grow the financial implications of it eventually has to.
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:35.360]  Yeah. But the thing, I mean, the thing about Apple with the large numbers is that they're very good
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.000]  about making sure that someone's going to gamble as their sales, it's going to be valid.
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:45.440]  Right. And I think that helps protect them from that problem.
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:51.200]  You know, you don't, I mean, what happens, you know, when you when you're focused on so much on one
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:55.920]  product, you know, like, we are this company and we make this thing and, you know, hey, everybody
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:01:59.120]  loves our product and, you know, and then you get to the point where, okay, everybody has your
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:05.040]  product. Well, then they don't know what to do next. And Apple doesn't think that way.
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:13.840]  It generally at least today. Right. Let me take a break and do our last and final sponsor and
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:23.280]  it's a good friend's at automatic. Have you heard of these guys? Oh, man, automatic. It's,
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:28.240]  they call it a small connected car adapter. It plugs into your car's diagnostic port. Now,
[2:02:28.240 --> 2:02:32.640]  I'm not a car guy. I didn't even know there was such a thing, but there is a standard car diagnostic
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:36.400]  port. And it's the same one that your mechanic users or your dealer, wherever you take your car,
[2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:42.160]  like when your car lights up and says you need service B2 or something like that, that's what
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:47.600]  the service guy puts in and it tells the, tells them, hey, the oil's down to 5% and, you know,
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:54.160]  this is no good anymore. And then that's also how they reset those things, like the way they
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:58.000]  said that the, you know, when they're done changing your oil, no car no longer tells you that,
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:04.400]  it all goes through this diagnostic port and where you plug automatics. It's a dingus, right?
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:11.040]  You plug it in. You plug the dingus in there. And every car since 1996 has one of these ports.
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:19.040]  It's a standard. And then it pairs to your phone over Bluetooth. And then when you drive,
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:22.480]  it connects your car to the internet and your car's on the internet because of your phone,
[2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:25.920]  while you're driving around. So what does it do? What's the point? Why would you want to do this?
[2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:29.280]  You're not a mechanic. If you were a mechanic, you'd already know about this, right?
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:34.800]  Well, you use their free mobile app. And the mobile app shows you, like, let's say, check engine
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:40.000]  light comes on. What the hell does that mean? Well, this port knows exactly why it came in. And so
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:44.240]  in plain English, it'll just tell you on your phone exactly what's wrong with your car.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:47.520]  Like, check engine light just means take the car to someone who knows what they're doing.
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:51.920]  Well, now you know exactly what it is. It could be something that is just complete nonsense,
[2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:55.600]  right? That you can just ignore it. Maybe it's a serious issue, but that way you'll know what it is,
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:59.040]  you know, you're not wasting your time or you, or you know you have a serious problem.
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:01.600]  And if it is a waste of your time, if it's something you don't care about,
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:05.840]  you just clear the light right there from the app. It goes over the diagnostic port and then it won't
[2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:12.000]  bug you anymore. Super convenient. It logs your trips. It logs your parking location. So like,
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:16.800]  when you shut the car off, the automatic just says to the phone, okay, give me my location. Okay,
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:21.280]  boom, I know where I am. And then you don't remember where you parked. Well, you could just check
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:29.200]  the app and the app knows where you parked. And it also does some coaching with driving habits.
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:36.000]  Tells you how to drive what speed, you know, what kind of mile an hour, or mileage you're getting,
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:39.280]  could save you a hundred, if you're a person who drives a lot, could save you hundreds of dollars
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:45.120]  a year in gas by giving you tips and scoring on driving. Sort of reminds me of Apple Watch,
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:50.000]  like what Apple Watch does to sort of steer you towards better health and motion and movement,
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:56.320]  automatic does for your car. Take Apple Watch for your car. They're fans of the show. They
[2:04:56.320 --> 2:05:02.160]  remember the old episode with Dan Benjamin, where I talked about, you remember this, I lost my
[2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:11.280]  license because I got caught driving. I got caught driving. How fast wasn't? I think it was 90.
[2:05:13.440 --> 2:05:18.960]  And they give you a warning. And they let you set it. They're default is 70, but you go over 70
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:24.320]  and it'll give you a little buzz like, hey, slow down, you know, lead foot. Or to save me a lot of trouble.
[2:05:24.320 --> 2:05:29.760]  But you can customize that. So I would turn that up a little bit. 70 sounds a little
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:34.000]  low to me. I'd turn that up to at least 85. But then you get a nice warning when it goes off.
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:37.760]  And serious stuff. I'm joking around there. I never lost my license.
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:44.640]  But they have serious stuff. I crashed detection. So automatic can detect a crash and connect
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:48.800]  to your phone and call for help for free, which hopefully you'll never need. Hopefully you'll
[2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:52.800]  never be in a crash frankly, but also hopefully you'll never be in a crash where it would actually
[2:05:52.800 --> 2:05:57.520]  help you if your car could do it, make the call for you. But if you needed it, well, it's there
[2:05:57.520 --> 2:06:02.560]  and it'll do it. And a human will even stand the line with you until hope arrives.
[2:06:04.160 --> 2:06:08.800]  They've got nest integration. So you can do things like get your home, heat it up or cool down,
[2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:13.840]  I guess we're heading towards summer as you're heading home. And all sorts of other stuff. I mean,
[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:20.240]  really, really, really deep stuff for nerds like where you can hook up to Google Docs and Twitter
[2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:26.000]  and Evernote and just by anything with an API of connected home devices, like the Phillips
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:29.440]  hue lights, they can get integration with that, get your lights turned on before you come in.
[2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:36.160]  Anyway, all sorts of cool stuff. It's so super, super simple. Free app. There's no subscription.
[2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:42.720]  You just buy the dingus. You buy the automatic dingus. It's $99.99. $99.95. There's no subscription
[2:06:42.720 --> 2:06:46.320]  fee. You don't have to pay money every month to get the service to do all this. You just buy it,
[2:06:46.320 --> 2:06:53.200]  you plug it in, you have the app, and it just works. Even better, use this URL, automatic.com,
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:57.920]  just like the automatic transmission, no funny spellings, automatic.com slash talk show,
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:03.840]  no the just slash talk show. And they're going to let you save 20% off. That's 20 bucks.
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:11.600]  So for just 80 bucks, you'll get this super cool dingus for your car, ships and two business days,
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:16.720]  and they have a 45 day return policy. So use it for a month, and you still have two weeks left
[2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:20.000]  where you can decide whether it's actually worth it and whether you like it. And then if you don't,
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:25.920]  you can just send it back. It's another good Mother's Day present. Fantastic Mother's Day present.
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:31.680]  And actually, I think you could say, so here's the scenario. You get your mom,
[2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:38.160]  if you're like a teenager or 16 or up, you get your mom some flowers, and then you buy yourself
[2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:43.200]  the automatic and tell her, mom, I know you worry about me. Don't worry now. I've got this thing
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:47.680]  that's in my car, and it's going to, it's going to take care of me. I'm going to make sure I don't speed.
[2:07:48.240 --> 2:07:51.520]  Now go take a nap on peace of mind, peace of mind. That's what your mom wants.
[2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:54.560]  Peace of mind. And she can take a nap on her new mattress. That's right.
[2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:02.400]  But anyway, my thanks to automatic, automatic.com slash talk show, buy it. It's super cool.
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:08.240]  Everybody, the car should be built in with this thing. That's the, I'm telling you, that's where
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:12.640]  this, this is, this is the pattern. She wakes up and looks at the fracture picture of your,
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:17.280]  of your, of you that you gave her. Right. Exactly. Some Mother's Day. Oh, my God, this is fantastic.
[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:22.640]  Uh, so what else on the earnings or the iPad? Anything?
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:32.400]  Uh, China, gang, gangbusters in China. Yeah. And, and did you see that, uh, Ben Beharen, uh,
[2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:39.520]  posted a, did not chart. He yesterday or today, I can't remember, um, that showed the various
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:48.560]  market share. I guess market shares in, in China and apples shoots up and jammies, shoots down.
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:55.920]  So now apples up over, jammies. Wow. So they're like number one. Uh, I think so. Yeah.
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:09:02.000]  I have to find it. Yeah. Um, pretty sure that's, yeah. And then which is kind of ironic,
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.920]  since we had to listen for so long about how Apple was doomed in China because of
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:11.280]  Xiaomi. Yeah. Well, and the ad apple was doomed without a low-cost phone. Like, I feel like of
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:16.160]  all the ways that sometimes if I lose the force for the trees with claim chowder, it's, uh,
[2:09:16.160 --> 2:09:23.840]  it's over whether it was important or not. You know, like, you know, and, and to me, the
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:28.400]  Apple needs a low-cost phone was important because these people, they were very serious people
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:34.560]  who were making the argument in the most dire terms possible that the only way the iPad or iPhone
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:39.760]  could continue and, and be any meaningful success for the company would be if they went after the
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:44.800]  low-cost market. They've already got the high end market. They got to go low, uh, or else they're doomed.
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:49.440]  And I mean, you, you could fill a book with the claim chowder on that. And what did they do?
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:56.080]  They raised the prices. They raised the price. The average selling price is like $60 a higher year
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:02.240]  over year because the iPhone 6 Plus starts $100 higher. Um, and so many people are buying the
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:09.280]  iPhone 6, uh, instead of like the mid-range phone, uh, so that their average selling prices went
[2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:13.920]  significantly higher. Not just like, oh, it's, you know, put an asterisk nest for it. It's actually
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:21.520]  a dollar higher than a year. It's like 60 bucks a phone higher. Um, and it was like they're never
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:27.360]  going to succeed in China without a low-cost phone. Yeah, right. Instead, they've had unprecedented
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:33.360]  success in China with their most expensive iPhones ever. Yeah, they're number one. Yeah, they're number
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:42.480]  number one now. Jammy's number two away and Samsung and then Lenovo. Send me that URL, paste that
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:51.760]  paste it so I can forget to put it in the show notes. Sure. Absolutely. Um, I think that's
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:56.720]  interesting. And I think it's, I talked to somebody years ago, and I know it's, it's hyperbole
[2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:02.240]  because it's, it's like the opposite. But the gist of the argument I heard a few years ago is
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:07.360]  that there's no such thing as emerging markets. That that's at least from Apple's perspective,
[2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:12.800]  there aren't. There's people who can afford to buy Apple products and there's people who can't.
[2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:20.080]  And yes, they're the distribution is not the same from country to country. Um, but that all sorts
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:25.920]  of other things change from country to country, you know, and that people in Germany buy products
[2:11:25.920 --> 2:11:32.000]  for different reasons than people in France, even though Germany and France are like economically
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:37.600]  appears in terms of like income and stuff like that. But that in Germany, I could be, you know,
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:40.960]  I could be getting this wrong. This might not be right, but it's, you know, like maybe in Germany,
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:46.160]  it's like it's a lot more important that if everybody you work with uses this brand that you
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:51.040]  would use that brand to whereas in France, it's more of an individualist thing. And maybe if you
[2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:54.720]  notice that a lot of people you work with these Apple phone that it would be making more likely to
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:59.280]  buy a Samsung phone to be different because it's cultural different, you know, but that the economic
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:04.640]  differences are just another factor in this incredibly different, you know, difficult matrix of
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:10.160]  what is going to sell where, but that the fact that there's billions of people in China and that
[2:12:10.160 --> 2:12:14.880]  their overall average income is actually pretty low. And a lot of them by US standards, it's
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:20.080]  incredibly low. Like it's not possible for them to buy an iPhone doesn't mean that they need to cater
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:25.840]  to that market to survive. And I think, I think the thing I saw, and again, I could be wrong on
[2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:30.000]  this, but it makes sense to me is that there's more millionaires in China than any other country in
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.480]  the world. Maybe I'm wrong about that. It could still be the United States, but I'll bet that it's,
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:39.280]  if it's not number one, it's probably getting pretty close. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And I mean,
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.240]  their middle classes as a balloon, which is one of the things they Tim Cook talked about on the
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:51.280]  conference. Right. So there, you know, that's, that's the perfect thing. Yeah, people that Apple
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:56.240]  sells. And I, you know, I don't think Apple sees the future. I think you talk to people that Apple,
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:00.720]  they, you know, they make good educated guesses, but then they look and then they adjust, you know,
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:05.440]  and clearly, you know, like one of the adjustments is clearly that they got caught a little flat
[2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:12.240]  footed on the big screen trend with smartphones. And it actually goes back to what we and I were
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:18.000]  talking about in the first hour of the show on production. And how do they produce this amazing
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:22.640]  number of iPhone six and six pluses, the soon right out of the gate, the first day that they're
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:27.200]  supposed to be available? Well, one of the ways they do that is they kind of started the train on
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:32.240]  that like two years ago. Like this year's iPhone was started two years ago. And, you know, next year's,
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:35.760]  you know, the one that there's the brand new phone, there's some team somewhere at Apple starting
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.560]  work on a brand new iPhone right now. That's not coming to market for another two years. And so,
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:47.440]  if the trend towards big iPhones became evident to them too late, there's no way to catch up quickly
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:51.840]  because it, you know, you can more or less tell when they decided that they needed to make a
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:55.760]  bigger iPhone because it was about two years before the iPhone six and six plus came out.
[2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:03.440]  So they definitely follow trends. But I think overall though, they're very, very, you know,
[2:14:03.440 --> 2:14:08.720]  it's a going where the puck is going to be by staying high-end in China than going low-end.
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:12.640]  Right. Because it's, there's so much economic growth there in that country.
[2:14:12.640 --> 2:14:18.080]  Yeah. But do you, do you think long-term that they would, they would go further down the scale though?
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:24.320]  I think eventually it'll have to. I think because it's just the inevitable way that all computers
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:28.160]  go, like eventually it really will go good enough. I mean, I mean, just look at the Mac. Like,
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:35.120]  I mean, we're talking about on the scale of, wow, I'm really starting to get bad at math,
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:40.000]  31 years, right, for the Mac. So Mac is a three decade old product.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:47.440]  And it's still relatively high-end, like the cheapest Mac you can buy, the 89 MacBook Air,
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:54.880]  is a pretty expensive compared to PC laptops. But the idea of an $899 Mac laptop,
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:02.560]  I mean, go back 15 years and that is crazy town. That's, you know, I'm talking about a
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:08.080]  very long scale, at least five, six, seven years, you know, that at some point there's going to
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:12.560]  have to be new iPhones that are at a lower price. And there still might be an iPhone pro,
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:17.760]  I mean, call it whatever you want, like the MacBook pro. But I think the price on that is going
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:25.440]  to have to come down eventually too, right? It's, it's not going to be in $700, $800, $900 device
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:32.400]  for, you know, forever. Just the way that like a high-end MacBook used to cost, you know, $5,000,
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:40.640]  $6,000. Yeah. Reteingly spent $2,500. I mean, I think it's like, that was like for a long time,
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:45.280]  that seemed to be what I was spending on a power books, mostly, probably back then.
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:49.680]  And I, you know, again, this could be like a 10 year thing easily, maybe even more. Again,
[2:15:49.680 --> 2:15:53.840]  the Mac is 30 years old. It took a long time for the Mac to have a laptop that was, you know,
[2:15:53.840 --> 2:15:58.320]  really a consumer-friendly price. But there's so much technology that can still improve battery life,
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:03.360]  can still go, you know, make, and Norden, you know, we, you know, wouldn't it be nice to have a bad iPhone,
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:08.320]  they don't even need to be charged once a week. The camera can improve tremendously. I mean,
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:13.280]  it's all sorts of things can, can improve like that. But eventually, I think it's got to happen.
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:17.920]  All right. Battery list, battery list never going to get better if they keep using 80 cent batteries.
[2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:27.520]  Imagine how great your battery, iPhone battery would be if they put it, if they put
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:37.840]  just $5 battery in there. One of those $5 batteries that you buy buckets of, wouldn't that be great?
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:44.320]  Come on, Apple. Last thing I can think of is Microsoft had a ton of announcements.
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:50.480]  Oh, yeah, that's right. That the build, build conference, which I guess is ongoing as we record.
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:56.320]  And in typical everybody, but Apple fashion, they spread them out over a couple of days.
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:03.920]  They're still doing the keynote, I think, right? Yeah. Well, I think it started yesterday,
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:07.360]  more. They always have. Oh, see, I thought it was too key to it. You're saying it's one,
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:19.040]  you know, I think it's the same one. So highlights is they announced a two initiatives. One
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:29.600]  that you can cross compile iOS apps for Windows 10, which I think is, I think is mainly about games.
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:33.600]  I don't know, not going to say that, but their example, they was like candy crush saga,
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:39.440]  including in a like objective C. It's like, so it's like a way to write Windows apps and
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  objective C, which is, again, I'm not a cocoa programmer, I never have been, but I've, you know,
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:52.960]  to go back to like the next era. I mean, and famously, it was like part of the contention,
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:56.640]  like when next was, this is the thing that I thought of with that. It's not even about Apple,
[2:17:56.640 --> 2:18:01.760]  but go all the way back to next. And again, this is all detailed, I knew this story,
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:06.800]  but it was detailed in the becoming Steve Jobs. Next needed productivity apps,
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.200]  and they didn't have the big ones. And so the ones that they did have were all written for next,
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:16.160]  by, you know, they were like in next little island, and it was no Microsoft Office for next.
[2:18:16.800 --> 2:18:20.560]  And they needed it for, you know, whether it was from marketing or whether it was for file
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:28.640]  compatibility and Bill Gates's quote was developed for it, piss on it, or something like something
[2:18:28.640 --> 2:18:33.120]  to that effect. Something, yeah, right. Some kind of bodily function on it, on the next computer.
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:42.160]  He had so little interest in doing it. And, you know, to think that now in 2015, Microsoft is,
[2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:47.360]  and again, it's not quite the same thing as developing, you know, for it, although, you know,
[2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:53.040]  also Microsoft has an awful lot of iOS apps that they make. And yeah, they've done a lot.
[2:18:53.040 --> 2:18:55.680]  And they're still writing Mac software and stuff like that. You know,
[2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:01.520]  a ton, a ton ton ton of iOS apps. But they're real, I mean, they're much more
[2:19:01.520 --> 2:19:05.520]  a cross-platform company. Yeah, it's definitely. But it's just crazy to think that they
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:11.680]  are supporting Objective C, which it was like the nichest of niche app programming languages.
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:16.320]  But the irony, the irony too that struck me though is that Microsoft is going after mobile
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:24.240]  developers to support Objective C. Exactly when Apple is like 10 months into a
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:30.880]  long-term push to move everybody to a new language swift. Yeah. Well, I wonder if they had that
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:36.320]  lying around. I don't know. Microsoft just, that's the sort of thing. Yeah, we're going to do that now.
[2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:39.600]  That's the sort of thing that they're really, really good at. I mean, it's, you know,
[2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:44.080]  their developer tools teams probably the best in the world, you know, and a good compiler
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:48.400]  engineers and stuff like that. And then they also have an Android thing. But an Android thing,
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:53.360]  I think, as my understanding, again, it's been a busy couple of days. But my understanding
[2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:57.040]  with Android support is that it's more like a runtime competitor. It's a runtime, right?
[2:19:57.040 --> 2:20:04.160]  Right. Right. When you say to me, runtime compatibility on, well, number one, as a guy who first
[2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:11.040]  and foremost cares about the UI and responsiveness, I think gross. But then the other thing that
[2:20:11.040 --> 2:20:16.960]  occurs to me is in today's world, everything, I mean, what are we using that's not plugged in? I
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:21.680]  mean, everything is wireless now, right? Even God damn, the new MacBook is meant to be used
[2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:27.760]  without being plugged in. Um, you say runtime compatibility layer and I hear battery, you can just
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:33.200]  watch here, hear a, hear a fan running. You could just, if you turn on the percentage meter,
[2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:43.360]  you can just watch the, the one's digit move. Right, 69, 68. So I've got a minute and 20 seconds
[2:20:43.360 --> 2:20:49.520]  to play this game. I, I just, and I know that again, they're good. They have really good engineers
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:56.320]  and Microsoft, but it just sounds to me like a terrible idea. Yeah, I, I, I mean, it's all
[2:20:56.880 --> 2:21:03.360]  yeah. I mean, they used to try and get Apple to do that kind of thing too, right? And
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:08.560]  it just never seemed like a good idea because what you, what you want is people coding directly
[2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:15.840]  for your, your platform. Yeah. Instead of, oh, yeah, we'll do you as an afterthought because we already,
[2:21:15.840 --> 2:21:22.560]  we already coded deliberately for somebody else's platform. But I mean, in terms of like, for mobile
[2:21:22.560 --> 2:21:28.080]  apps, at this point, they'll take what they can get, I guess. Well, and it also, the other thought
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:34.560]  they're popped into my head was the same way that Sony is making 20 bucks pop on Samsung and iPhone
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:40.320]  sales with the cameras that Microsoft while they're losing money on the Windows phones that
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:44.640]  they're making and selling with the Nokia thing. But they're making money on every Android
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:50.880]  phone with all the patent licensing deals that they've, that they've forced, you know, and according
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:55.840]  to the law rightfully so. I mean, you know, again, we patent show would be, you know, a whole
[2:21:55.840 --> 2:22:01.600]  another two hours. But, um, but they're making a nice little tidy profit every year on, on Android
[2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:08.800]  phones. Right. Makes you wonder. It was like, it was like, at one point, it's said like $10 a device
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:14.480]  or something crazy like that. Yeah. Yeah. Serious money. You know, especially given that the way that
[2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:24.400]  that Android is much more about quantity of units rather than quantity of, or it's, you know, price
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:32.000]  per unit, like apples. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like you'd rather have $10 per unit on Android in Western
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:38.480]  countries. Um, then have $10 per unit on iPhone sales. Like iPhone, you'd want like a percentage,
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:42.800]  whereas Android, you want something like that, like a $10, you know, flat fee could be a lot of money.
[2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:48.000]  And I'll tell you what else is looking cool. I think that the HoloLens thing is really starting
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:52.720]  to look cool. The, the, I thought it looked cool to begin with. It's just like the only thing is that
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:58.560]  it's not, it's not a real product. No. And it still has, again, it's still no price, no availability
[2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:02.000]  date. Yeah. But in the time since. But, but they're showing you that the other thing is they're
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.720]  showing it again. Well, and it doesn't require the backpack anymore, right? Like when they showed
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:12.960]  it the last time, it had like a some kind of, not a backpack, but you know, it had a piece that
[2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:18.080]  wasn't just on your hand that was connected to it. You know, and now it's entirely on your head,
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:25.360]  like they've made significant gains in terms of, you know, how practical it would actually be.
[2:23:25.360 --> 2:23:30.800]  Again, you know, who knows what they're even thinking about the price. But, and I think it looks
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:37.520]  really cool. And I can totally see wanting it. So tie this in with the beginning of the show. My
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:42.560]  big worry is that this HoloLens thing is going to be so totally cool and is so totally not going
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:51.760]  to work with, with one bum eye. I really do. I, I was talking to another friend who has a,
[2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:56.880]  not this retina detachment, but just a weird eye problem in one eye, similar situation to me where
[2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:01.440]  it's one eye just, it doesn't see so good. It may not see so good ever again. And that we're both
[2:24:03.520 --> 2:24:08.560]  sort of like been looking forward to like VR our whole lives and might be missing out on
[2:24:08.560 --> 2:24:16.080]  any prospect of good stereo VR. But anyway, I think it looks super cool. And I have to say,
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:21.360]  I, to me, that is the golden goose in their development pile. Like there's something there that
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:26.080]  could be a hit product. Well, I really hope it is. You know, I mean, and like I said, I'm glad
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:29.760]  that they're showing it again and that it wasn't just something that they tried it out to be like,
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:32.800]  hey, we made a big splash and now we're just going to kind of forget about this thing.
[2:24:33.360 --> 2:24:37.360]  I mean, and even if it's, you know, well, who knows, it's like sometimes you make a cool
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:41.280]  platform and you never know where it's going to go, right? Like the iPhone, people use it,
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:45.600]  you know, people use iPads and hospitals and universities and it's stuff like that. And
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:49.840]  other people use it to read books and play games and whatever. Like I could see this being that
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:53.760]  sort of thing where some people buy it so they can play Minecraft on their tabletop, which really
[2:24:53.760 --> 2:24:58.480]  does look cool. Like the demo that they show, it looks amazing. I could see it like being an amazing
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:03.520]  gaming device, but I could also see it being used in a really serious way, like in a factory floor
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:08.400]  so that, you know, somebody who's working assembling something can get this real-time display. And
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:13.760]  I always see people pop up like, how can you say that this is cool? And you should all over
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:20.240]  Google Glass all the time. And it's like, I can't believe I have to explain it. It's like,
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:26.320]  the idea of a heads-up display is an idea. And nobody has ever said that's a bad idea. Google Glass
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:32.080]  was not the idea of a heads-up display. Google Glass was the exact Google Glass thing that they made,
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:38.320]  which was ridiculous and stupid, right? And I just know that these people, like, when somebody,
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:42.720]  whether it's Microsoft with this HoloLens or somebody else who's got a secret thing,
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:47.280]  and somebody's going to make a heads-up display that is cool, and people say it's cool,
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:52.320]  and these Google, Google fans are going to be like, you know, calling hypocrisy. And it's like,
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:56.000]  no, you know, it's completely different. It's a very different product.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:01.840]  Right. Criticizing a specific product is not criticizing a product category or a general idea.
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:08.240]  Like, and I think Microsoft says, you know, 12 different things better than Google Glass.
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:11.840]  Like, they're not making something that they're proposing that you're going to wear all day.
[2:26:11.840 --> 2:26:17.840]  Let's start with that, right? And I've seen people who say, well, you know, Google Glass,
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:21.360]  you'd wear it, you know, wear it if, you know, like the factory floor thing.
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:25.280]  Well, then if that's your case, if you're working, why not make it bigger? Why just have this
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.360]  little odd thing up in the corner? Why not do, like, what Microsoft's doing and give yourself
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:36.080]  a big, full-field vision? Yeah. You see the apps they have, too, they've written it so that
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:42.960]  and it's, to me, this is very, I'm not quite sure how this works, but they're universal apps
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:49.360]  work literally on every product they have, like from a desktop PC to a phone and to this
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:54.480]  HoloLens. So like, if you write like a Twitter client, you can have like the same Twitter client
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:59.280]  that runs on your phone and runs on your, on your laptop would also like if you had this HoloLens
[2:26:59.280 --> 2:27:03.840]  on, you could project it on your wall. Well, you wouldn't project it on your wall, you'd see it
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:11.200]  on a wall or something. Yeah. Right. Right. It's interesting. It's a very, it's a sort of Xboxy
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:17.680]  kind of thing. Yeah. Like, like a new Xbox sort of thing. And how they're, they seem to be
[2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:23.040]  like when they, when they started doing the Xbox, they bought Bungie and Halo was the big
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:29.280]  centerpiece. They're not exactly doing this with Minecraft, but they're definitely, you know,
[2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:34.640]  they're, they're speaking to a whole generation of people, you know, much younger, are like our
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:42.000]  kids by plugging that, playing that into this device. And I think, you know, I mean, like, I,
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:48.160]  I haven't even shown my son that yet because it'll, it'll freak out. Yeah. Jonas who want,
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:54.400]  who want one of medium. Yeah. Jonas has seen it and it's, it's already like on the Christmas list.
[2:27:54.400 --> 2:27:59.440]  And I'm like trying to explain what a prototype is. And I'm like, my red time I told you about
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:02.720]  the cars at the car show. I'm never going to be so. And then I don't think you were listening to me.
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:05.920]  And he's like, yeah, well, we went to coming out. And I'm like, I'm telling you that I don't know that
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:13.120]  I don't know. And I think growing up in an Apple focused household has also
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:16.400]  when you see, yeah, right. When you see something, you know, it's available. Right. It's going to be
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:21.920]  available short. Right. And you know, like the longest one in his lifetime is the watch and the watch
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:32.800]  that is shipping now or hopefully, you know, hopefully shipping is a pretty much 98.9% what they showed
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:39.360]  back in September. Yeah. Very, very, very similar. Yeah. All right. He didn't, he didn't get,
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:43.680]  he didn't get his yet. No, he did not note the only one ship. And as far as I know, like I said,
[2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:47.120]  as far as I can tell on Twitter, I haven't done deep research. As far as I can done, nobody
[2:28:47.120 --> 2:28:52.880]  who ordered 38 millimeter space black or space gray, whatever you call it, got one. Like the
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:58.240]  ones, the years, the 42 has. But as far as I can tell, 38 millimeters space gray has not shipped.
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:02.480]  Interesting. And I can definitely, well, it's good thing I didn't know because I almost ordered
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:07.600]  38. You wouldn't have it. Good thing I didn't do that. I'll say this. We should wrap up. But I
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:13.680]  will say this with, with the, I have the 42 I've been wearing the 42. And I asked it, you know,
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:18.880]  when, when, for the review unit, they asked me which size I wanted. Um, without trying it on,
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:22.320]  it was like before I was there for the briefing. So I didn't get to, I'm sure that if I had said,
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:26.800]  hey, this looks ridiculously big. Can you give me a 38 that they could have accommodated me? But,
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:30.560]  and I think I'm happy with the decision. And honestly, it tied all back with the beginning of the
[2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:34.960]  show. Part of it is my eyesight. I'm actually, you know, I find the 38 a little harder to read.
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:40.480]  Well, that's, and that's what I was, that's what I was told because I was heavily leaning
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:45.520]  38 because I, my wrists are not, they're not huge. And I was really, and I've always had
[2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:51.520]  smallish. I've never had, you know, like not, um, I've always had smaller sized watches. And
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:56.880]  I didn't want something clunky thing because I tried on it. Like a friend of my wife says a
[2:29:56.880 --> 2:30:02.240]  Motorola 360. Yeah. And so I tried on hers. And it was just like, oh my God, this is ridiculous.
[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:09.600]  It's nothing like that. It's so huge. Yeah. And so I was worried about it. Um, but I, I'm, but I
[2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:15.200]  was told like, okay, battery life might be a concern. And then also the screen, screen size is
[2:30:15.200 --> 2:30:20.480]  actually you kind of want something that's a little bit larger. So there's a benefit to it anyway.
[2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:25.360]  And so I went 42 and I'm quite happy with what I got. But I tried Amy's 38 millimeter with the
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:29.840]  millenies on and it looked perfect on my wrist. Look, it just found did not look dainty, didn't look
[2:30:29.840 --> 2:30:33.600]  the least bit feminine or whatever. And I've met. Well, that's the thing. It's not, I mean, they're,
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:36.800]  they're the same damn watch. I mean, they're, you know, other than the size, it's like, it's like,
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:42.720]  it's not like one doesn't have flowers all over there. So well, but there's also like a different
[2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:47.520]  size could be too small though. It really could. Uh, you know, I wrote about it. I suppose,
[2:30:47.520 --> 2:30:51.840]  yeah, I suppose, but if you have really small wrists, I don't think, I mean, there's no,
[2:30:52.400 --> 2:30:55.040]  I don't think there's a real, I don't think there's a real problem getting to 38, but
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:00.240]  yeah, I was perfectly happy with the 42. Yeah, I think 38 is like a regular man size watch,
[2:31:00.240 --> 2:31:04.640]  you know, it, and it, and not in the modern world where these watches are really big, but like
[2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:08.720]  going back a long time. And that on most women, it's going to look like a large woman's watch.
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:14.480]  It's a regular man's watch or a large woman's watch. And the 42 is sort of a slightly large
[2:31:14.480 --> 2:31:20.960]  man's watch. Yeah. Um, but it did you seem, but you know, Mike Rundle, it's like a designer type
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:25.920]  guy on Twitter, but he had a post on medium where he complained that it's way too small. Like
[2:31:25.920 --> 2:31:30.160]  that's how small 42 millimeter Apple watches is that there's some people with good taste,
[2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:35.440]  you know, but, and who are used to the, the current watch market who, who, who seriously, and I
[2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:40.080]  think correctly argue that it's too small. Yeah, some people, some people really do like large watches.
[2:31:40.080 --> 2:31:45.520]  Right. Yeah. Honestly, I don't know. I don't either. I think it's a weird trend. I don't
[2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:49.600]  really, you know, say, I don't like the large phones, but yeah, right. I don't like that.
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:31:54.240]  But there's nobody, nobody is arguing about the, any other smartwatch on the market to date that
[2:31:54.240 --> 2:32:01.920]  it's too small. No. I don't think there's any way. All right. John Moltz, people can get all the
[2:32:01.920 --> 2:32:10.160]  moltz they want at very nice website.net. Yep. They can listen to the dulcet tones of your voice.
[2:32:10.960 --> 2:32:17.600]  How many podcasts now? I've got three now. All right. So I have, uh, the rebound with, uh,
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:24.880]  Lex Freeman and Dan Morin talking about technology. I have turning this car around with Lex and
[2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:31.360]  John Armstrong talking about parenthood. And then I have the speedy error cast talking about
[2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:35.760]  the arrow TV show with our good friends, Guy English and Dan Morin. So.
[2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:40.960]  Never heard of you there. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Right. It's not familiar with
[2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:50.960]  their words. Not familiar with their. If I repeat Guy English, I'm going to touch them.
