[00:00.000 --> 00:03.080]  As we record, we are recording on Thursday, November 19th.
[00:03.080 --> 00:08.680]  I have seen reports now on Twitter that people are saying that the Apple pencils are actually
[00:08.680 --> 00:11.160]  starting to appear in retail stores.
[00:11.160 --> 00:15.200]  I saw that somebody was in San Francisco and there's a whole bunch of them available.
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.200]  Yeah.
[00:16.200 --> 00:21.880]  Yesterday, the Wednesday, the 18th, there were a lot of reports that it looked to me like
[00:21.880 --> 00:25.120]  that they were making an effort to get them out.
[00:25.120 --> 00:28.680]  There were a whole bunch of reports that I saw five of them here and there were 20 of
[00:28.680 --> 00:32.800]  them there and I thought that was a good sign and there's more of that today.
[00:32.800 --> 00:39.480]  So it looks like whatever was going on, whatever a logistical bottleneck was there maybe
[00:39.480 --> 00:45.360]  has, if not, if it hadn't solved itself at least, has widened the bottleneck a little
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.360]  bit.
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.400]  I'm curious to see what happens to people who were promised three or four week shipping
[00:51.400 --> 00:56.280]  dates like a week or two ago, whether they start getting them way earlier than promised
[00:56.280 --> 00:59.800]  or whether the shipping ones still take as long as they had thought.
[00:59.800 --> 01:05.680]  Yeah, that's the, I wonder sometimes if Apple has really thought through the whole dichotomy
[01:05.680 --> 01:12.400]  of shipping versus Apple store, retail store pickup because with the Apple TV, I wonder
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.120]  how many returns they're going to get where people bought them the moment that it was
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.480]  for sale, had them shipped on the cheaper shipping.
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.840]  So they'd get them the next week and then found that they were all in the Apple stores
[01:22.840 --> 01:23.840]  on the day.
[01:23.840 --> 01:24.840]  That's what happened to me.
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.440]  I got my box and just put the label back on it and sent it back out because three days
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.120]  earlier, I just walked into my local Apple store and pick one up.
[01:34.120 --> 01:37.520]  And this is like that too a little bit where it's like, you know, if you could get one
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.160]  in the retail store and your order says it's going to be four weeks out, that's sort
[01:42.160 --> 01:43.160]  of silly.
[01:43.160 --> 01:47.000]  I mean, I get why they don't want to turn people away who want to buy an iPad pro at
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.800]  the retail store and want to pencil with it, they want to kind of have a pencil for them.
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.600]  But it would be frustrating if you were waiting at home for it for months.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.600]  Yeah.
[01:56.600 --> 02:03.840]  And it just, like when you show it to people, it's like just showing it to somebody.
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.080]  If I didn't have the pencil, I would, I honestly don't even know what I would tell them.
[02:08.080 --> 02:09.240]  It's like, here's a big iPad.
[02:09.240 --> 02:10.240]  Yeah.
[02:10.240 --> 02:12.880]  I mean, you have a gun smaller.
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.120]  People definitely want to try the keyboard and, you know, it's, you know, and it's interesting
[02:17.120 --> 02:20.120]  to, it's easy to imagine a big iPad.
[02:20.120 --> 02:24.560]  It is different to actually sit down in front of it and use it.
[02:24.560 --> 02:28.320]  But just for like the first minute or two, everybody wants to use the pencil.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.320]  Yeah.
[02:29.320 --> 02:30.680]  How could you not, how could you not?
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.040]  And even though it's not like there haven't been styluses for iPads before, but this
[02:36.040 --> 02:38.320]  is, you know, it's the Apple stylus.
[02:38.320 --> 02:40.520]  So it's got that kind of attraction around it.
[02:40.520 --> 02:44.640]  The idea is, and it sounds like it's a bearing out for everybody we know who actually
[02:44.640 --> 02:49.840]  knows about drawing things like syrenity cauliflower, that it really does deliver on that,
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.800]  but its precision is pretty amazing.
[02:51.800 --> 02:58.880]  And that on the apps that have been updated, the lag is very, very minimal.
[02:58.880 --> 02:59.880]  Yeah.
[02:59.880 --> 03:00.880]  Yeah.
[03:00.880 --> 03:01.880]  Totally.
[03:01.880 --> 03:02.880]  I think it's bearing out.
[03:02.880 --> 03:05.440]  And the palm rejection is all bearing out as promised.
[03:05.440 --> 03:06.440]  Oh, yeah.
[03:06.440 --> 03:12.480]  I've been trying to like figure this out and look at how they're doing the palm rejection.
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.080]  And it, I'm sure it's probably more than this, but it seems like the two things I can
[03:17.080 --> 03:19.800]  tell that they're doing is, and the one is obvious.
[03:19.800 --> 03:25.320]  Which is kind of looking for what I'll just call a fat touch, meaning like the meaty part
[03:25.320 --> 03:31.920]  of your palm, and just rejecting it out right, that, wow, that is either an enormous thumb
[03:31.920 --> 03:34.000]  or that's the palm.
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.920]  But the other thing that they're doing is like in a drawing mode, I could see it in the
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.800]  notes app when you're in a little sketch mode in notes, is sometimes when you've
[03:43.800 --> 03:50.120]  put your palm down, you'll get a false hit and it'll put like a little drawing mark there.
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.040]  It's hard to see sometimes, you know, you kind of have to look at it at an angle because
[03:54.040 --> 03:58.120]  your palm actually covers it, but it puts like a little false pen mark down.
[03:58.120 --> 04:02.040]  But then as soon as the pen touches, it just says, oh, okay, you're using the pen, throw
[04:02.040 --> 04:04.440]  that, throw that last mark away.
[04:04.440 --> 04:05.440]  Yeah.
[04:05.440 --> 04:06.440]  Which I think has something to do with there.
[04:06.440 --> 04:08.240]  They've got this whole touch color lasting thing.
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.800]  I mean, they're trying to view, it's not a one to one, it's a little bit like autocorrect
[04:12.800 --> 04:17.120]  for typing, I think, where it's trying to look holistically at sort of like what it's getting
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.320]  input on the screen and make some judgments and they may be sort of in real time, they're
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.680]  trying to figure out what actually is going on instead of just it being, I think, the
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.120]  old style touch screens were much more of a one to one kind of thing.
[04:29.120 --> 04:32.200]  It's what it's not, I'll tell you what it's not is, it's not locking out everything but
[04:32.200 --> 04:37.000]  the pencil because you can actually, I don't know if you've tried this, but if you put
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.880]  two fingers down on the screen in notes, you'll get the ruler, it'll actually bring up
[04:41.880 --> 04:47.880]  the ruler and then you can, with your other hand, you can draw on the ruler and it'll snap
[04:47.880 --> 04:49.040]  with the pencil.
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.520]  So it's not like it's locking out the screen from other, from fingers, like that's
[04:54.520 --> 04:55.520]  not it.
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.400]  It is looking for that meaty blob of a, of a, of a, of the side of your hand or, or of
[05:00.400 --> 05:06.280]  the, the butt of your, of your palm and realizing what it is and saying, I'm just going
[05:06.280 --> 05:07.280]  to ignore that.
[05:07.280 --> 05:08.280]  Right.
[05:08.280 --> 05:16.000]  It does get, I wonder if it, maybe, but it's, I think it's probably some kind of reasonable
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.160]  distance, you know, like if you had, if you had a finger way apart from the pen, it's
[05:21.160 --> 05:24.520]  going to know that that's not a touch from the hand holding the pen because it's too far
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.520]  away.
[05:25.520 --> 05:30.240]  It's like that distance of when you're gripping a pencil and a, you know, a pencil grip that
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.160]  that touch that's maybe like, what is that about two or three inches away?
[05:34.160 --> 05:39.280]  Okay, that's, and it happened a half a second before the pen began drawing.
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.960]  That's the one that they're away.
[05:40.960 --> 05:42.760]  Yeah, you're right.
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.560]  I just actually did it where I put my finger and the pen down simultaneously very close
[05:47.560 --> 05:53.400]  to each other and started moving and, um, and that the finger mark started and then vanished
[05:53.400 --> 05:57.360]  because it realized you're kind of going, going along with the pen, you, you weren't meant
[05:57.360 --> 05:58.360]  to be there.
[05:58.360 --> 05:59.360]  Yeah.
[05:59.360 --> 06:06.560]  I think long, long story short, it's, and we can go long after a short version, but, uh,
[06:06.560 --> 06:13.280]  I think that even though I'm not an artist, I just appreciate it and I just like playing
[06:13.280 --> 06:17.120]  with it and I'm excited by it that it's one of the most exciting things apples done in
[06:17.120 --> 06:18.120]  a long time.
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.360]  Like this is the sort of thing that we look to Apple to do and now they've done it.
[06:22.360 --> 06:23.360]  Yeah.
[06:23.360 --> 06:30.160]  Yeah, this is, I feel like, right, they, they so much of the story of this product, I think
[06:30.160 --> 06:35.840]  in hindsight, is stuff that Apple really didn't make much of an effort to integrate into
[06:35.840 --> 06:41.160]  the iPad until the moment when Apple wanted to build its own thing that was integrated
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.360]  hardware and software.
[06:42.360 --> 06:47.840]  And so you get all the keyboard stuff in iOS 9 is really leading to the smart keyboard.
[06:47.840 --> 06:55.600]  And the reason that they haven't done higher resolution digitizer, you know, more 240 megahertz,
[06:55.600 --> 07:00.040]  or 240 Hertz scammer on the digitizer, why didn't they do all that stuff because they,
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.160]  they weren't ready for it and, and now they're ready for it.
[07:03.160 --> 07:07.400]  And so the, the pencil is the, gets to be first out the door because of course it is because
[07:07.400 --> 07:08.840]  it's the Apple accessory.
[07:08.840 --> 07:09.840]  Yeah.
[07:09.840 --> 07:15.840]  Did I saw something, is it, was it, was it, was there like a tear down of the pencil finally?
[07:15.840 --> 07:21.520]  I think it was one, I'm not sure I read it, but they did, I think they did take it apart.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.040]  I still don't think anybody has figured out exactly how it works, but like from what
[07:26.040 --> 07:31.320]  I've been able to piece together, I don't, I think I was wrong in my review when I
[07:31.320 --> 07:40.200]  guessed that there's like some kind of new sensor, like something in the iPad to detect
[07:40.200 --> 07:42.120]  the pencil.
[07:42.120 --> 07:47.320]  Instead, I'm, I'm almost certain that what's going on is that the regular touch sensors
[07:47.320 --> 07:57.280]  in the glass are still touch, still detect skin the same way, but that they've added
[07:57.280 --> 08:03.720]  into the exact same layer, the ability to detect the pencil and the way that the pencil
[08:03.720 --> 08:09.400]  makes itself known, is it emit some kind of like a radio wave of some sort at a known
[08:09.400 --> 08:15.720]  very specific frequency, but that it's not a different thing that's picking that up,
[08:15.720 --> 08:24.000]  it's actually the same as the touch sensors and that somehow it's like the radio wave
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.320]  stuff is so precise, is that that's what allows it, like if you imagine that it's a grid
[08:28.320 --> 08:34.560]  of sensors with capacitive touch, where it touches your finger, it's always looking for
[08:34.560 --> 08:39.640]  a bunch of them to light up at once because you're, you know, it's like you've little
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.240]  quarter of a inch round fingertip that's touching and so it's lighting up all of these
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.240]  at once.
[08:45.240 --> 08:50.640]  And then with the pencil, it's right down to the actual pixels, including the ability
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.040]  to sort of tell when it's between pixels.
[08:53.040 --> 08:59.240]  Yeah, I, I mean, I don't know enough about this to something funny is going on, of course,
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.440]  because when we know that because you can't use it on another screen, it is, it is not trying
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.560]  to trick the device into thinking that it's a, it's a really thin finger, right?
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.560]  Right.
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.480]  Something, it is some, whether it's a radio signal or it's an electric signal of some
[09:15.480 --> 09:20.160]  kind, that's not the kind that you would pick up from a, from a finger, there's something
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.000]  going on where it's, it's doing it and getting that precise, you know, it knows exactly
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.080]  where that, that pencil is and when, and then, and then it also was talking by a Bluetooth
[09:29.080 --> 09:32.080]  and registering the pressure, so it knows when it's down and not.
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.840]  Long story short, it's, I'm, I'm nearly certain that they didn't add a second sensor grid
[09:36.840 --> 09:37.840]  for it.
[09:37.840 --> 09:43.520]  What they did is make the existing sensor grid smarter and, and have it looking for this
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.680]  other new thing, this, this short term radio burst, here's a weird thing that I didn't
[09:49.680 --> 09:50.680]  write about.
[09:50.680 --> 09:54.200]  I haven't really seen anybody else write about, but I still, I'm not sure what to think
[09:54.200 --> 09:55.680]  about it.
[09:55.680 --> 10:01.600]  Um, but it really seems very strange to me is the fact that there is no, there is no
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.840]  interface to the pencil other than plugging it into the lightning port.
[10:05.840 --> 10:12.120]  So you, you charge it that way and you register it with the iPad that way.
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.920]  But then once you do that, once you have a fully charged iPad or a pencil, once you have
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.120]  a fully charged pencil and it's paired, you never turn it on, never turn it off and you
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.800]  never get any indication that it's on, off, low on battery or anything.
[10:25.800 --> 10:32.880]  Yeah, it's like a, I mean, we joke sometimes about Apple saying magical a lot and about
[10:32.880 --> 10:37.840]  how it wants to make its products kind of black boxes that you can't look into.
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.400]  But this pencil is, is like, um, I'm going to, I'm going to pander to you and say, this
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.240]  is the, this is the pencil that's on the desk that, uh, Dave Bowman wakes up in, right?
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.280]  It is like, look, human, we have made a pencil and it's this perfectly white and a little
[10:53.280 --> 10:58.200]  bit silver slick kind of object that it, it, it, I know it's shaped like a pencil,
[10:58.200 --> 11:00.360]  but it can't really be a pencil, right?
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.320]  And it, that's what it feels like to me is it has no interface, you're right.
[11:04.320 --> 11:07.680]  It has no kind of markings other than the little silver circle.
[11:07.680 --> 11:10.560]  And yeah, you can get to the lightning port if you take the cap off and you can unscrew
[11:10.560 --> 11:12.320]  the tip, but it is featureless.
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.760]  It is just, I mean, it is literally featureless, like not just like it's looks of features,
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.680]  but it's features, it's, you don't do anything with it, except draw, it's, it's very
[11:22.680 --> 11:23.680]  clever.
[11:23.680 --> 11:28.360]  And I think it's also very much in line with Apple's design philosophy, which is to have
[11:28.360 --> 11:29.800]  as little there as possible.
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.080]  Yeah, it's, we've, we often joke about Apple stuff that, you know, they, they try to ship
[11:34.080 --> 11:38.120]  stuff with one button, but ultimately they want to ship something with no buttons.
[11:38.120 --> 11:41.240]  And the pencil is the no button device.
[11:41.240 --> 11:43.200]  Yeah.
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.800]  And there is this part of me that kind of wants it to light, I have like a green, just a
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.600]  little green dot that lights up when it's on and being used.
[11:53.600 --> 11:56.920]  And then it turns off when it's sleeping or whatever.
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.440]  Um, but now here I am, you know, two weeks later, and I don't have that.
[12:01.440 --> 12:03.400]  And it's never been an issue.
[12:03.400 --> 12:09.040]  Like I kind of see why they didn't do that, but I just assume it wakes up based on some,
[12:09.040 --> 12:12.720]  but based on motion or something or based on, based on, I don't even know what it is.
[12:12.720 --> 12:13.720]  I don't know.
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.280]  It saves some battery when you, when you lay it down, it doesn't move for a while or
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.280]  something.
[12:18.280 --> 12:19.280]  Right.
[12:19.280 --> 12:22.600]  Because it seems I still haven't even recharged it and I've been playing with it for two
[12:22.600 --> 12:23.600]  weeks or something.
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.360]  I don't, I don't, it definitely gets a long battery life.
[12:27.360 --> 12:33.320]  So it can't be sitting there emitting these waves, you know, until it's in use.
[12:33.320 --> 12:39.200]  But on the other hand, too, like if it was just in your backpack, though, moving, moving
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.240]  around as you walk around, I don't think it's on.
[12:42.240 --> 12:47.480]  I'm not quite sure when it turns on, or what that means, or maybe like a lot of these
[12:47.480 --> 12:58.600]  things you like in the way that your, your iPhone can use the motion co-processor to
[12:58.600 --> 13:03.760]  count your steps and it's not really having a significantly adverse effect on the battery
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.560]  life of your phone compared to all the other things that can actually drain your phone.
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.000]  Maybe they put like the equivalent of like a little M6 in the pencil and it's always
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.680]  there kind of detecting similar things.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.840]  I don't know.
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  But it's kind of crazy.
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.240]  Isn't that wild though that it doesn't even tell you if it's on, off, or low on charge?
[13:23.240 --> 13:24.240]  Yeah.
[13:24.240 --> 13:25.240]  It's, it's featureless.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.240]  It's empty.
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.240]  It's just a blank, right?
[13:27.240 --> 13:30.960]  It's just an implement that you hold in your hand and use it against the, the glass surface
[13:30.960 --> 13:32.680]  and things happen.
[13:32.680 --> 13:39.160]  So it is that the big downside to it is that if it is out of battery, the only way you're
[13:39.160 --> 13:45.600]  going to know that is by like having it fail on screen, like you're going to go to use
[13:45.600 --> 13:52.120]  it and you're going to stab at the screen and it's like the, the experience of figuring
[13:52.120 --> 13:57.760]  out that your pencil is run, has run out of power is exactly the same as the experience
[13:57.760 --> 14:01.360]  of having a pencil that isn't yet paired with your iPad.
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.400]  I think the difference is that your iPad knows how much battery is in there.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.680]  And if you not only can you swipe down in, in notification center, it will, there's a
[14:10.680 --> 14:17.880]  batteries thing that will show you the iPads battery and also the Apple pencils battery.
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.960]  And I would have imagined, I would imagine that it tells you that the iPad tells you when
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.400]  you need to charge your Apple pencil.
[14:24.400 --> 14:27.760]  So I just swipe down and I can see that this pencil that I'm holding in my hand is
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.760]  26% battery.
[14:29.760 --> 14:30.760]  But that's the interface.
[14:30.760 --> 14:31.760]  It's on the iPad.
[14:31.760 --> 14:33.280]  It's not, you know, it's not in the pencil.
[14:33.280 --> 14:40.960]  I think I screwed myself by like, I, at one point in my review process, I just left it plugged
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.520]  in and I, I'd used it a lot the pencil and then I plugged it in and for no reason, it
[14:45.520 --> 14:46.520]  wasn't like it was out.
[14:46.520 --> 14:49.880]  I just plugged it in and left it plugged in and it, so it obviously filled back up.
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.040]  And so I haven't, I haven't run it back down yet.
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.480]  But yet I say I screwed myself because I really did want to kind of see what, you know,
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.280]  does it give you a warning like that?
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.280]  Yeah.
[15:00.280 --> 15:07.120]  Yeah. I haven't seen it give me a warning yet, but I can see that it's a 26% so that's
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.920]  like the one place where I can, I can tell that it's communicating beyond the actual
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.280]  drawing is that it, it tosses in a little battery info into the notification center.
[15:17.280 --> 15:28.080]  I had lunch today with the Lauren Brector, formerly of Twitter, inventor of pulled a refresh,
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.920]  tweeted, et cetera, et cetera, hadn't, he hadn't seen it yet, so I brought it along and,
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.520]  and he got to play with it.
[15:33.520 --> 15:39.160]  And his first comment was, and it's sort of like we said about sort of like this, you
[15:39.160 --> 15:44.960]  know, the 2001 style industrial design or, or like, you know, futuristic space aliens
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.720]  have made this pencil that it is absolute, it's so, he said that this is such an apple
[15:49.720 --> 15:50.720]  device.
[15:50.720 --> 15:56.360]  It is so beautiful, but also, this is not a material that anybody has ever used to create
[15:56.360 --> 16:00.880]  a pen out of before, like nobody's ever made a pen or pencil that is slick.
[16:00.880 --> 16:01.880]  Yeah.
[16:01.880 --> 16:06.680]  And it's not to say that it's slippery, and I don't know that it's even a problem, but
[16:06.680 --> 16:11.680]  it is a sort of material that nobody would have, it would ever have used for this before.
[16:11.680 --> 16:13.720]  It's a little slippery.
[16:13.720 --> 16:18.680]  Well, I guess it reminded me of, I mean pencils, depending on you get a brand new pencil
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.880]  out of the box, and it's got that fresh coat of an animal paint on it.
[16:22.880 --> 16:24.760]  It's not that far off from that.
[16:24.760 --> 16:28.760]  I think the differences that I'm used to pencils that have, you know, that they're,
[16:28.760 --> 16:29.760]  they're not round.
[16:29.760 --> 16:30.760]  They're flat.
[16:30.760 --> 16:34.400]  They're, they're, whatever, hexagonal or octagonal, they've got the little flat surfaces
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.280]  that come together to make the pencil, and this is just perfectly smooth and perfectly
[16:38.280 --> 16:39.280]  round.
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.360]  And it would roll right off your desk except it's weighted so that it will stop.
[16:43.360 --> 16:44.360]  Right.
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.960]  Um, I will say this, and you know, we can, we could do a whole, I could do a whole two
[16:48.960 --> 16:59.360]  hour show just on stationary pens and pencils, but a very, very popular style of ink pencil.
[16:59.360 --> 17:05.560]  I mean, talking about real, real pens here are like a pilot G, what do they call them?
[17:05.560 --> 17:06.560]  G threes.
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.960]  I don't use the pilots anymore, but the gel, you know, the click, yeah, I've got a G
[17:09.960 --> 17:10.960]  two right here.
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.880]  Yeah, the G two, um, which, and you know, I use the ones from Zebra, there's a couple
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.000]  of other brands, but you know, they, they started in Japan, now they're very popular
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  around the world.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  But my point is they all, all of them share a design thing, which is the down where you
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  grip it.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.800]  There's like a piece of rubber, um, which just to me seems like total common sense.
[17:33.800 --> 17:37.800]  But it's, I don't know, I'm, I'm curious what people, that one of the things I'm curious
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.200]  now that the pencil is going from, okay, Apple released a new thing.
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.080]  It's a novelty to, okay, people are actually using it is what are the people who, who
[17:46.080 --> 17:49.600]  are going to use this thing for like hours at a time for work, going to say about the
[17:49.600 --> 17:52.880]  ergonomics of the materials and stuff like that.
[17:52.880 --> 17:56.120]  Yeah, I'm not so sure that it's comfortable.
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.520]  I'm not, I'm not either, but again, I'm, I don't think pins in general are comfortable.
[18:00.520 --> 18:05.440]  I don't like handwriting once I could stop turning in my papers in school, handwritten
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.680]  and could start typing them all.
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.200]  I was a very happy person.
[18:08.200 --> 18:13.080]  But yeah, it struck me right away that there was no, uh, I've gotten used to the grip
[18:13.080 --> 18:16.600]  on the G2 at the bottom, um, there's no clip on it.
[18:16.600 --> 18:23.120]  Um, and I guess maybe that goes back to this sort of apple philosophy of the, I guess
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.080]  what a, our friend John Syracuse calls the naked robotic core, like make it and build the
[18:28.080 --> 18:32.640]  product for its essence, almost knowing that if you want to add something to it, people
[18:32.640 --> 18:34.240]  will build things to add to it.
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.840]  But that Apple, if Apple adds those things on, then you can't opt out of them.
[18:38.840 --> 18:42.000]  And this definitely feels like somebody's going to want to make a grip for it and somebody's
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.120]  going to want to make a clip for it and a little ink well kind of thing for people to, to
[18:46.120 --> 18:47.760]  stash it when they're not using it.
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.840]  All of those things will be made for it, but Apple wanted to kind of get it all the way
[18:51.840 --> 18:52.880]  to its base.
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.680]  Um, and whether that's right or wrong, I mean, I think it depends on whether you like holding
[18:57.680 --> 18:58.680]  it in its base form.
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.040]  If, if, if there are a lot of people who think, no, no, I just want this and nothing
[19:02.040 --> 19:05.440]  more, it would kind of be a shame if it had other things on top of it.
[19:05.440 --> 19:06.440]  Yeah.
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.520]  Um, I wonder, I don't, I don't, it's another one of the things that probably, if it's
[19:10.520 --> 19:14.040]  not out already, there's going to, that's got to be like some kick starters from people
[19:14.040 --> 19:19.360]  who are going to make replacement caps that the only difference is that it has a clip.
[19:19.360 --> 19:20.360]  Yeah.
[19:20.360 --> 19:25.920]  Or even, or even just some kind of asymmetrical nubbin so that it doesn't roll at all.
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.920]  Right.
[19:26.920 --> 19:27.920]  A little clip on clip.
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.480]  So you can put it in your pocket or something.
[19:29.480 --> 19:30.480]  I think would be a natural.
[19:30.480 --> 19:35.720]  And I'm sure somebody's already got that 3D printed and I don't know.
[19:35.720 --> 19:36.720]  Ready for Kickstarter.
[19:36.720 --> 19:37.720]  Yeah.
[19:37.720 --> 19:44.200]  It's almost like, and I feel like that's also sort of Apple's decision on, on the much
[19:44.200 --> 19:50.960]  observed point that there's nowhere to put it officially, meaning, let's just say
[19:50.960 --> 19:55.920]  comparing contrast with the Newton where there was an official place to put this stylus
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.440]  with the Newton, it was a socket right in the top of the Newton.
[20:00.440 --> 20:03.760]  And obviously that design wouldn't work for this because the pencils actually thicker
[20:03.760 --> 20:10.880]  than the iPad, or if it isn't, it's so close that there's no way that a socket would
[20:10.880 --> 20:14.560]  have worked, but they wouldn't have done that anyway.
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.480]  Just because I think that there's, that's not really their style anymore.
[20:18.480 --> 20:19.480]  Yeah.
[20:19.480 --> 20:22.320]  I'm a little surprised there isn't an optional, you know, something and probably they
[20:22.320 --> 20:25.160]  looked and just couldn't find a way to make it make sense.
[20:25.160 --> 20:28.720]  I mean, you can use the magnets and clip it to the side magnetically, but they're probably
[20:28.720 --> 20:31.920]  not strong enough to really reliably leave it there and less thing you want to do is
[20:31.920 --> 20:34.400]  have it fall off and break on the floor.
[20:34.400 --> 20:40.120]  So instead it's just, you find another place to put it and people figure it out.
[20:40.120 --> 20:46.320]  Well, and I was a little surprised, I mean this goes all the way back to September because
[20:46.320 --> 20:50.000]  I could see, you know, in the hands-on area that this was the case because they had the
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.320]  covers for it.
[20:51.320 --> 20:55.560]  But on that day I was a little surprised that they didn't have on the smart cover and
[20:55.560 --> 21:00.560]  smart keyboard something, you know, whether it's just a flap that you could stick it in
[21:00.560 --> 21:06.760]  or a magnet or something, you know, something on the cover that is meant for a well, okay,
[21:06.760 --> 21:11.080]  you can't connect it to the iPad Pro itself, but if you get our cover or our keyboard,
[21:11.080 --> 21:15.720]  there's a little place here where you can put your pen pencil.
[21:15.720 --> 21:16.720]  And they didn't do that.
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.560]  And I guess it's because not everybody gets the pencil.
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.960]  And so then the thing where you would put the pencil would look, you know, if you got
[21:24.960 --> 21:27.760]  the cover, but not the pencil, it would look like you're missing a pencil.
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.120]  Yeah, I think that's, I think that's behind a lot of these decisions is it is not as much
[21:33.120 --> 21:35.280]  as we all talk about it and write about it.
[21:35.280 --> 21:38.000]  It is not an essential feature of this product.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.120]  And so you can't build it with the assumption that everybody's going to have one.
[21:43.120 --> 21:44.120]  Exactly.
[21:44.120 --> 21:48.920]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[21:48.920 --> 21:49.920]  And it's a new sponsor.
[21:49.920 --> 21:51.560]  I'm very excited about this.
[21:51.560 --> 21:59.200]  This episode is being brought to you by Brain Tree, Brain Tree, let's you code for easy online
[21:59.200 --> 22:00.200]  payments.
[22:00.200 --> 22:04.000]  If you're building a mobile app and you are searching for a simple payment solution,
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.160]  check out Brain Tree.
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.160]  They have an SDK.
[22:07.160 --> 22:09.760]  It makes it easy to offer multiple payment types.
[22:09.760 --> 22:15.920]  You can start accepting PayPal, Apple Pay, Bitcoin even, venom, which I've never even heard
[22:15.920 --> 22:21.240]  of, cards, of course, and more, all with a single integration.
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.600]  One small snippet of code and you're all set up in less than 10 minutes.
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.640]  That's how easy they say it is.
[22:27.640 --> 22:37.640]  To learn more and you get your first $50,000 in transactions, fee free, go to braintree.com
[22:37.640 --> 22:41.040]  slash the talk show.
[22:41.040 --> 22:45.440]  There, I mean, these guys are, they're talking points for this are hell bent on how easy
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.760]  this is to implement.
[22:46.760 --> 22:49.240]  Not only do they say it's only going to take 10 minutes, they say if you don't even
[22:49.240 --> 22:53.000]  have time, if you're worried about how long it's going to take to integrate, you can
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.480]  sign up and call them and they have people on the other end of the phone who will walk
[22:57.480 --> 23:04.360]  you through the integration of hooking, hooking up to the SDK, SDKs for iOS, Android and
[23:04.360 --> 23:14.920]  JavaScript for doing it through the web and seven different languages,.net, Node.js, Java,
[23:14.920 --> 23:18.560]  Pearl, PHP, Python, Ruby, all sorts of stuff like that.
[23:18.560 --> 23:24.080]  Open code, clear documentation and literally they're saying you can integrate this into
[23:24.080 --> 23:27.640]  your app with 10 lines of code in your app.
[23:27.640 --> 23:28.640]  So go check them out.
[23:28.640 --> 23:35.760]  If you're a developer looking for payments, braintree.com slash the talk show.
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.160]  10 lines of code can't be that.
[23:38.160 --> 23:40.160]  Pretty good.
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.000]  So you had a piece, one of the reasons I wanted to have you on the show and I thought it
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.400]  really, really echoed my thinking on this and I kind of touched on it but skipped about
[23:50.400 --> 23:51.400]  it.
[23:51.400 --> 24:00.120]  Is this whole issue of, okay, now with the iPad Pro and with iOS 9 and where it is today,
[24:00.120 --> 24:04.360]  can you use your iPad, can you use an iPad Pro for work?
[24:04.360 --> 24:07.720]  Which is sort of, I think the problem is that that's not a fair question.
[24:07.720 --> 24:11.280]  I feel like you need to specify what the work is but I thought you had a good piece that
[24:11.280 --> 24:19.200]  was more or less, for some definition of work, yes and for your work, mostly yes.
[24:19.200 --> 24:27.360]  But that it's with 20 some years of Mac experience under your belt and all of this stuff,
[24:27.360 --> 24:30.480]  maybe the answer is still just that you don't want to.
[24:30.480 --> 24:37.000]  Yeah, I counted it's 26, fall of 89 is when I started using the Mac.
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.880]  I remember, I actually remembered from your article that it was exactly 26 because it
[24:40.880 --> 24:44.600]  was such an uneven number, I figured it must have been exactly right but I didn't want
[24:44.600 --> 24:47.200]  to say that because it makes a sound old.
[24:47.200 --> 24:48.880]  So I went with 20 some.
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.240]  I know 20 some, well it could be even worse but it's probably better.
[24:52.240 --> 24:57.240]  Yeah, it was because it was my sophomore year in college and I started working at the
[24:57.240 --> 24:59.480]  newspaper and they were all Mac there and I had an Apple too.
[24:59.480 --> 25:03.160]  So I'd used a Mac a couple of times before but that was the point where I stopped using
[25:03.160 --> 25:07.920]  my Apple too basically and I did all my work on the Macs at the newspaper office even
[25:07.920 --> 25:13.360]  in my school work because I didn't want to go back but that's a lot of history.
[25:13.360 --> 25:19.720]  Yeah, I think it's absolutely true that you can't say the iPad and iOS in general are
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.520]  not possible tools to use to do your job.
[25:23.520 --> 25:26.240]  I mean, yeah, there are going to be jobs where the software isn't there and they're
[25:26.240 --> 25:27.240]  very particular.
[25:27.240 --> 25:28.240]  This is the internet, right?
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.160]  So people are going to say, well, actually, my profession, I can't do on that.
[25:32.160 --> 25:33.600]  It's like, I'll grant you.
[25:33.600 --> 25:36.360]  There are professions that where you can't but if you're talking about general kind
[25:36.360 --> 25:41.480]  of, I look at spreadsheets and I write documents and I answer email and the kind of
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.360]  businessy jobs we think of and I'm on the web, of course the iOS can do that, of course
[25:47.360 --> 25:48.360]  the iPad can do that.
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.000]  I think my realization in spending so many of us who write about these products have
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.440]  done over the last few days, which is use the iPad Pro a lot to try to do things that
[25:58.440 --> 26:03.520]  we don't normally do on an iPad, it became clear to me that it was not the issue wasn't
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.200]  could it do it, the issue was the migration thing.
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.480]  It's like, you know, something for something to be worth migrating to from a place where
[26:11.480 --> 26:16.280]  you're really comfortable and you've set up like, I've got scripts and you're like
[26:16.280 --> 26:17.280]  this too.
[26:17.280 --> 26:20.520]  I know, I've got scripts, I've got a workflow, I've got apps, I've got everything set
[26:20.520 --> 26:21.520]  up.
[26:21.520 --> 26:28.480]  I feel like I've super optimized what I do on my Mac for me over the course of 26 years
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.800]  and for me to switch from that to something new, you know, there's the hit you have to
[26:33.800 --> 26:38.320]  take, you have to learn new apps, you have to learn new automation processes.
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.880]  You've got to put in, invest hours and hours of time to get back to where you were and
[26:44.880 --> 26:47.880]  that's a pretty decent calculation that you can make.
[26:47.880 --> 26:53.400]  You can say, look, even if it's as good as the Mac is today and let's just grant it
[26:53.400 --> 26:58.520]  that, you might, that might not be worth it because there's too much effort that's going
[26:58.520 --> 27:01.920]  to have to go into it to move over there or when you get there, it's going to turn out
[27:01.920 --> 27:08.640]  that you're not quite as effective, you're not as fast as, as, as you were on the Mac.
[27:08.640 --> 27:14.160]  And so I would say that I came to the realization because I had a lot of podcasts and logic
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.280]  and I've had a bunch of people say, well, you should really try audition from Adobe.
[27:18.280 --> 27:21.680]  And I have the same sort of thing, which is audition might be better than logic.
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.600]  I'm not sure if it is for, for what I do, but let's say it's arguable that I would
[27:25.600 --> 27:28.320]  be better off editing an audition in the logic.
[27:28.320 --> 27:29.320]  That's not good enough.
[27:29.320 --> 27:33.120]  It's got to be a lot better because I'm going to take a huge hit when I move and have
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.080]  to learn a new thing.
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.240]  And sometimes it doesn't, I mean, you never want to say no to learning a new thing,
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.920]  but sometimes the math doesn't work where it's like, it's incrementally better, but
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.280]  I will be so far in the hole in terms of my learning that I'm never going to be, it's
[27:48.280 --> 27:51.120]  never going to pay off or it won't pay off for years and years.
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.480]  But you don't know until you try whether it's actually going to be better or not.
[27:54.480 --> 27:59.400]  So that was my realization with the iPad, is that probably 90% of the things that I've
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.680]  got set up to do on my Mac, I don't use very often and I don't need to bring over.
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.960]  I don't need to list like, oh, I've got 100 scripts and BB at it that I need to change.
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.080]  It's probably not that, but there are things that I would have to adapt to.
[28:12.080 --> 28:16.360]  And you know, that I think is going to be a problem for everybody.
[28:16.360 --> 28:19.520]  Fortunately, we don't have to switch, right?
[28:19.520 --> 28:26.200]  I mean, I can foresee using an iPad when I travel now in a way that I couldn't foresee
[28:26.200 --> 28:31.760]  it a year or two ago, not abandoning the Mac entirely, but using the iPad as a substitute
[28:31.760 --> 28:32.880]  when I want to travel light.
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.720]  I could see that now, but that requires me to put in some time and change my workflow
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.160]  in some of the things that I do and adapt to new tools.
[28:42.160 --> 28:44.280]  But it's a matter of choice.
[28:44.280 --> 28:50.160]  For somebody who's younger and who doesn't really have those ties and hasn't super automated
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.840]  their computer experience, then that barrier is completely gone.
[28:55.840 --> 28:56.840]  Yeah.
[28:56.840 --> 29:04.680]  And in a couple of ways, podcasting is a pretty fun example, right?
[29:04.680 --> 29:09.480]  Because editing podcasts, then you'd mention that people are saying that you should
[29:09.480 --> 29:15.000]  recommend and you switch from logic to a dope position on that's on the Mac.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.280]  But you did find there is a new iOS app.
[29:18.280 --> 29:24.640]  And so you actually edited an episode of, was it the incomparable on the iPad?
[29:24.640 --> 29:25.880]  What's the name of the app?
[29:25.880 --> 29:29.480]  The app is called Fairite F-E-R-R-I-T-E.
[29:29.480 --> 29:30.480]  Yeah.
[29:30.480 --> 29:32.800]  And it's free with two in-app purchases.
[29:32.800 --> 29:37.080]  It's basically if you want to unlock all the features, it's $20, but you can try it without
[29:37.080 --> 29:42.080]  and you can unlock half the features for 10 and then go buy the other half for 10.
[29:42.080 --> 29:43.600]  And yeah, I tried it.
[29:43.600 --> 29:47.240]  I actually, I tried it and I was thinking, wow, these guys who wrote this totally read
[29:47.240 --> 29:48.240]  my mind.
[29:48.240 --> 29:53.880]  And then later I discovered that they actually had read my site and had seen my...
[29:53.880 --> 30:00.440]  And I've been listening to your shows and listening to your, you're like, well, one of the
[30:00.440 --> 30:05.240]  things that would keep me from being able to work on an iPad would be I need to edit
[30:05.240 --> 30:10.840]  podcasts and if I wanted to edit podcasts on an iPad, I would need this, this, this, this.
[30:10.840 --> 30:13.880]  And all those features are in Fairite, which is, it was that moment of like, are they reading
[30:13.880 --> 30:17.600]  my mind and it turns out no, they're actually reading what I've written and they were
[30:17.600 --> 30:21.400]  working on it, but that was like, I think it was a good, I didn't inspire the app, but
[30:21.400 --> 30:25.200]  I think I, to be created, but I think I may be inspired some of the feature choices that
[30:25.200 --> 30:28.120]  they made, which is awesome because that's great for me.
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.480]  It's really nice when somebody builds an app and keeps you in mind when they're doing it.
[30:31.480 --> 30:36.000]  I also forgot that in June, the guy wrote to me and said, do you have any sample files
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.920]  because I want to use like real world examples and I sent him an episode of the incomparable
[30:39.920 --> 30:43.720]  that was down to the, just to the tracks and I said, here it is and I totally forgot about
[30:43.720 --> 30:47.640]  it and I sat down and edited, not remembering any of that.
[30:47.640 --> 30:53.120]  I edited an episode and you know, it's the thing I did this with logic once I did this
[30:53.120 --> 30:57.040]  with audition once before I switched to logic, I definitely tried it where you take a
[30:57.040 --> 31:01.400]  run at and you're like, all right, experiment, could I use this other tool to do this thing
[31:01.400 --> 31:08.360]  that I do every week that is mission critical that if I'm 25% slower, I'm going to not
[31:08.360 --> 31:13.480]  be able to do my job because like literally I've got it totally wired and it needs to be
[31:13.480 --> 31:16.880]  fast and it needs to be like this or I can't switch.
[31:16.880 --> 31:22.080]  And I expected to get 10 minutes in and be like, well, it was a nice try, I pad, but
[31:22.080 --> 31:25.920]  this is not going to happen and like an hour and a half later, which is about maybe
[31:25.920 --> 31:29.400]  two hours, it's the standard time, it takes me to edit an episode of the incomparable.
[31:29.400 --> 31:33.560]  I had edited the entire episode and about halfway through I was like, oh man, I'm actually
[31:33.560 --> 31:36.840]  going to edit this whole thing right here and it was pretty great.
[31:36.840 --> 31:41.040]  I mean, there were some issues, it was, it went a lot faster when I had the keyboard than
[31:41.040 --> 31:45.600]  when I was just doing touch, but it was pretty, it was pretty great and some of that was
[31:45.600 --> 31:48.840]  the screen size and some of that was the power, although I think I could probably do it
[31:48.840 --> 31:55.240]  on the iPad Air, but that was a funny moment where I realized that when I had the right
[31:55.240 --> 31:59.440]  tool, the iPad was, was great for that sort of thing.
[31:59.440 --> 32:00.440]  Yeah.
[32:00.440 --> 32:06.880]  I do think, I think there's just to step back a little bit to where we were five minutes
[32:06.880 --> 32:13.080]  ago, which was this, when did you first start using a Mac and that transition from using
[32:13.080 --> 32:17.080]  something with like a command line interfaces, the main interface to the computer, to the
[32:17.080 --> 32:21.560]  GUI, I do feel that we're, that this is the same type of transition.
[32:21.560 --> 32:22.560]  Absolutely.
[32:22.560 --> 32:30.720]  Except that one was, it was different in a few ways, for me at least, where the difference
[32:30.720 --> 32:38.720]  with the command line to GUI transition was that it was going to replace it for everybody,
[32:38.720 --> 32:43.280]  that this is clear that for almost everything and obviously, you know, you max today
[32:43.280 --> 32:47.960]  still ship with a terminal app and I know that for, you know, the main use I can think
[32:47.960 --> 32:52.840]  of is people who do like system administration type things, just use, you know, terminal
[32:52.840 --> 32:54.760]  and SSH connection.
[32:54.760 --> 32:57.720]  And for good reason that there's, you know, that that's actually a really good remote
[32:57.720 --> 33:04.280]  interface to something that might be slow and there are things that you can do remotely
[33:04.280 --> 33:10.200]  administering a faceless server that the command line is just fine for if you're an expert.
[33:10.200 --> 33:16.960]  But you know, from 99 point, some very large 10th digit, you know, nobody needs to
[33:16.960 --> 33:18.360]  ever see that.
[33:18.360 --> 33:26.080]  Whereas with this transition, I really do think that Steve Jobs' trucks and cars analogy
[33:26.080 --> 33:32.560]  is just an amazingly good analogy, which is that for whatever odd reason, we made everybody
[33:32.560 --> 33:37.160]  drive a truck for a long time until we finally got good enough at this and came up with
[33:37.160 --> 33:40.920]  ideas that were more like a car.
[33:40.920 --> 33:44.520]  But you know, just go out on a highway in any state in the country and you're going
[33:44.520 --> 33:47.520]  to see an awful lot of people who drive pickup trucks.
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.280]  But it's clearly not the majority and there's no reason for it.
[33:52.280 --> 33:53.280]  Yeah.
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.120]  I mean, the command line thing, what struck me about it is is so many of the arguments
[33:58.120 --> 33:59.120]  were the same, right?
[33:59.120 --> 34:03.280]  It was like, well, when you start using a Mac back in the day, it was, well, you can't
[34:03.280 --> 34:04.280]  do.
[34:04.280 --> 34:08.680]  I can delete every file with this name in it by just typing a quick command in DOS.
[34:08.680 --> 34:09.680]  Right.
[34:09.680 --> 34:10.680]  And can you do that?
[34:10.680 --> 34:15.320]  Right, a program and run it and you know, but you can't do that on the Mac and totally
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.320]  true, right?
[34:16.320 --> 34:17.480]  Totally true.
[34:17.480 --> 34:19.440]  But that's where we had our own ways, right?
[34:19.440 --> 34:22.840]  We had our own nerdy things that we did that weren't those ways and that they were right
[34:22.840 --> 34:24.160]  about those.
[34:24.160 --> 34:25.240]  But you know, the Mac was just different.
[34:25.240 --> 34:26.240]  It didn't do those.
[34:26.240 --> 34:27.240]  But and that's the same argument.
[34:27.240 --> 34:28.240]  Right.
[34:28.240 --> 34:29.240]  It's like, oh, well, the iPad is not powerful.
[34:29.240 --> 34:30.240]  You can't do this thing.
[34:30.240 --> 34:31.240]  You can do it on the Mac.
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.240]  Totally true.
[34:32.240 --> 34:33.240]  Right.
[34:33.240 --> 34:34.240]  You could.
[34:34.240 --> 34:37.880]  It was that they, the argument about being able to delete, did delete like every file with
[34:37.880 --> 34:43.720]  the same extension, you know, what was the DOS command for it, Dell was like the equivalent
[34:43.720 --> 34:44.720]  of RM.
[34:44.720 --> 34:45.720]  RM, right.
[34:45.720 --> 34:46.720]  Yeah.
[34:46.720 --> 34:47.720]  Right.
[34:47.720 --> 34:48.720]  That you could do.
[34:48.720 --> 34:49.720]  Start on star.
[34:49.720 --> 34:50.720]  Sure.
[34:50.720 --> 34:58.560]  Dell or Dell star dot TXT or something like that, it's such a bad argument because being
[34:58.560 --> 35:06.080]  and because that was a command that was, you know, like there was no undo, it was, you
[35:06.080 --> 35:07.080]  know, it's like how fast.
[35:07.080 --> 35:10.400]  It's like, how are I can, I'm, you know, I can take this thing.
[35:10.400 --> 35:11.400]  Right.
[35:11.400 --> 35:12.400]  I, my car can go 150.
[35:12.400 --> 35:14.640]  And it's like, okay, well, good luck with that.
[35:14.640 --> 35:15.640]  Right.
[35:15.640 --> 35:18.960]  You know, if you're not on the on a bond, that's probably not that practical.
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.120]  And you might get yourself killed, but good, you know, good for you that your car can theoretically
[35:23.120 --> 35:24.120]  go that fast.
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.120]  But it was a point of pride and flexibility.
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.200]  And I hear the same things when people, when I read about the iPad, and I'm not Federico
[35:30.200 --> 35:31.200]  Vitechi, right?
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.800]  I don't, I'm not a 99% on the iPad, but I'm open minded enough about it that I hear from
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.280]  people who are like, no, never because of X and Y that it doesn't do that.
[35:41.280 --> 35:43.120]  And it's like, you're right.
[35:43.120 --> 35:44.720]  The Mac does those things and it doesn't.
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.800]  I'm not sure in the end that for the people who are going to want to use the product, those
[35:48.800 --> 35:49.960]  things are going to matter.
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.880]  And the fact like the fact that it doesn't do apple script and it doesn't have, it doesn't
[35:53.880 --> 35:57.920]  have some of the automation utilities that run in the background and stuff, that's true.
[35:57.920 --> 36:00.360]  But it's got its own scripting and its own automation utilities.
[36:00.360 --> 36:01.360]  They're just different.
[36:01.360 --> 36:02.360]  Yeah.
[36:02.360 --> 36:06.600]  So there are OS iOS nerdiness is there already.
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.680]  It's just not the same as Mac nerdiness and that's going to be off-putting for some people.
[36:12.680 --> 36:18.160]  I don't know the truck better for, I see what you're saying in some ways, but I don't
[36:18.160 --> 36:23.920]  think it's going to be a matter of that the touch interface is inappropriate or that the
[36:23.920 --> 36:26.160]  devices aren't powerful enough.
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.360]  I'm starting to think, and that's why I mentioned 26 years of using the Mac, I'm starting
[36:30.360 --> 36:35.960]  to think that it's going to be in some ways generational, that it's like I'm more comfortable
[36:35.960 --> 36:40.640]  using these tools in this way and this industry is more comfortable with these tools
[36:40.640 --> 36:42.560]  that are used this way.
[36:42.560 --> 36:50.560]  And I'm not sure that people who are, your kids age, my kids age are going to feel that
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.920]  way or even people in like in their 20s to 30s, people who haven't invested in their computers
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.960]  as a nerdy platform, but just as a standard tool that they use to get things done.
[37:00.960 --> 37:08.440]  Because I do think that the iOS devices are capable of doing this stuff.
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.440]  That's not the issue.
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.440]  It's not like you can't load a couch into the back of your car, but you can into a pickup
[37:13.440 --> 37:14.440]  truck.
[37:14.440 --> 37:17.840]  It's more like maybe like how we'll get with self-driving cars where some people are going
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.200]  to want to drive their own car and other people are going to be like, I don't care where
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.920]  it's about, what's your preference and what tools are you're comfortable with and I don't
[37:24.920 --> 37:25.920]  think there's anything wrong with that.
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.520]  I don't think anybody should feel threatened that, I mean, Apple feels very strongly.
[37:30.520 --> 37:37.680]  Like the Mac is a tool and iOS is a tool and you can use them as you choose and for the
[37:37.680 --> 37:38.680]  right jobs.
[37:38.680 --> 37:44.120]  And I think that's a good attitude to have that it's not either or and people shouldn't
[37:44.120 --> 37:46.520]  feel threatened by one or the other.
[37:46.520 --> 37:47.520]  But they do.
[37:47.520 --> 37:49.520]  Some people totally do.
[37:49.520 --> 37:55.160]  And like I heard from some of the, like some of the, you know, and if you're listening,
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.620]  if you want the people who's emailed me and sort of angrily denounced Tim Cook, this
[37:59.620 --> 38:06.120]  was all, it started with Tim Cook telling the newspaper in England that he, you know, he was,
[38:06.120 --> 38:09.440]  he's, I don't know, maybe he's still in Europe, I don't know, but he was on like an extended
[38:09.440 --> 38:10.440]  trip in Europe.
[38:10.440 --> 38:13.080]  He was, you know, visiting a couple countries over there.
[38:13.080 --> 38:18.880]  And he said that for this trip, all he's, all he carries with him was his iPhone and his
[38:18.880 --> 38:21.640]  iPad pro and presumably as watch.
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.520]  Um, in fact, I somebody pointed out that in one of the pictures he's clearly wearing
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.560]  his watch, no surprise.
[38:28.560 --> 38:33.320]  Um, and I heard from readers who were like, that's BS, you know, maybe if you're an executive
[38:33.320 --> 38:36.640]  and you've got a staff that travels with you that can do your work, you can do your work
[38:36.640 --> 38:37.640]  with it.
[38:37.640 --> 38:43.480]  But it's like, I think people underestimate a lot of people underestimate how, how there are
[38:43.480 --> 38:48.860]  a lot of jobs in a lot of places where you can really could just do your job with not
[38:48.860 --> 38:51.760]  think, but communication tools really.
[38:51.760 --> 38:58.480]  If you can read on the device and you can, you know, send email and do eye message and
[38:58.480 --> 39:04.560]  slack or whatever similar type of thing, if it's mostly about communicating, uh, you can
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.440]  easily do all your work with an iPad and a phone or even just a phone.
[39:09.440 --> 39:10.440]  Yeah.
[39:10.440 --> 39:17.040]  And, and our audiences are, you know, they're, they're, they're more advanced than a lot
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.240]  of people, they care about this stuff to, to a degree that a lot of people don't.
[39:21.240 --> 39:26.120]  I think that that, I think that's all, all true, but that's why when I, I hate to be so
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.200]  reductive because everybody's different, everybody has different needs and they're going
[39:29.200 --> 39:30.200]  to be some people.
[39:30.200 --> 39:34.480]  I talk to them and they say, can I do X, it used to be, can I switch to the Mac from a PC?
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.400]  I have these needs and sometimes I would just say, I don't think it's a good idea, right?
[39:38.400 --> 39:41.080]  Because sometimes it's, it's, it's, the tools aren't there.
[39:41.080 --> 39:46.080]  I, I might, you know, my dad was a dentist and, and they talked to, to other dentists would
[39:46.080 --> 39:47.080]  say, what about this?
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.240]  And I'd be like, you know, all the dentistry software is on Windows, so you should probably
[39:50.240 --> 39:51.240]  just get PC's.
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.840]  I wish I could help you, but, you know, this is probably the safest option and the same
[39:54.840 --> 39:59.360]  is true with going to iOS, but when I look, I mean, I, I was talking to David Sparks
[39:59.360 --> 40:03.560]  the other day and he said to me, it was funny, he said to me something I had been thinking
[40:03.560 --> 40:08.160]  in the last few days using the iPad Pro, which is, he said, you know, I think word is better
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.800]  on iOS than it is on the Mac and it's, I totally agree.
[40:11.800 --> 40:17.080]  I think Microsoft Office on the iPad is way better than offices, at least for my uses
[40:17.080 --> 40:21.520]  and, and in my testing with it, than it is on the Mac, it just, it feels really good.
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.400]  It's really, these are class of the platform kind of apps.
[40:25.400 --> 40:29.160]  And I think, you know, there are a lot of people whose jobs are entirely Microsoft Office
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.600]  and email in, you can use Outlook for that or whatever and the web and, and that's, those
[40:34.600 --> 40:37.840]  are their jobs and they're not specialized in any way.
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.400]  And those kind of jobs where you're not having to dive deep into a particular vertical,
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.280]  you know, platform thing thing, why not do that on an iPad?
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.360]  I mean, whether you want to use an external keyboard or not, not to say that you have
[40:51.360 --> 40:52.840]  to, but you could.
[40:52.840 --> 40:53.840]  Yeah.
[40:53.840 --> 40:59.040]  So I'm going to take another break, but when you come back and this is where my podcast
[40:59.040 --> 41:06.560]  company just tricks in, what I want to talk about next is I want to go right from there into,
[41:06.560 --> 41:13.800]  to me, the lack of thought that Apple, or maybe not thought, but the lack of, of running
[41:13.800 --> 41:18.440]  code that lets you use the iPad with a keyboard connected.
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.680]  In other words, that you can't, that more or less, why can't you navigate the whole interface
[41:21.680 --> 41:23.320]  with the keyboard?
[41:23.320 --> 41:28.440]  But first, I want to tell you about our good friends at Squarespace.
[41:28.440 --> 41:39.280]  You guys know Squarespace is the easiest way to build a website.
[41:39.280 --> 41:40.280]  You just go there.
[41:40.280 --> 41:41.480]  Let's say you want to have a personal website.
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.720]  You want to make a blog, or let's say you want to start a podcast, or let's say you are
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.960]  a business that you want to set up an online store.
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.280]  Any of those things you can do with Squarespace, Squarespace, it's just like, it's like
[41:55.280 --> 41:59.160]  Legos for building a website.
[41:59.160 --> 42:02.240]  It is so easy, and they take care of everything.
[42:02.240 --> 42:04.240]  You can register your domain with them.
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.320]  They obviously take care of the hosting, but they've got these great drag and drop visual
[42:09.320 --> 42:17.120]  tools, templates to choose from, both in terms of setting up a style, like a visual style,
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.040]  for what your site's going to look like, or just the templates for setting up different
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.440]  types of sites, like the difference between a portfolio, like if you're an artist and you're
[42:26.440 --> 42:30.720]  setting up a portfolio site to show off all of the work that you're done.
[42:30.720 --> 42:35.840]  They have that built in as something that you can already start with and just make it
[42:35.840 --> 42:37.880]  work.
[42:37.880 --> 42:39.080]  Everything looks professional.
[42:39.080 --> 42:42.760]  You go through Squarespace to get a professionally designed website.
[42:42.760 --> 42:46.280]  You don't need to learn, no, any sort of code.
[42:46.280 --> 42:48.360]  It is intuitive, easy to use.
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.360]  You don't need, it's not like you're programming a website, you're creating it visually.
[42:52.360 --> 42:55.960]  But if you do know how to code, there are hooks that you can break in.
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.280]  You can insert your own JavaScript, that's sort of thing.
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.520]  So you can customize it if you want to.
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.920]  Huge websites, they can handle all of the traffic you're ever going to get.
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.720]  And it starts, they have plans that start at eight bucks a month.
[43:12.720 --> 43:13.720]  So here's what you can do.
[43:13.720 --> 43:17.320]  You can go there, you get a free trial, no credit card required.
[43:17.320 --> 43:19.400]  Go to Squarespace.com.
[43:19.400 --> 43:25.640]  And when you do sign up, just remember this, the code is Gruber, my last name, just remember
[43:25.640 --> 43:26.640]  that.
[43:26.640 --> 43:32.120]  And if you use that, when you do sign up for a Squarespace, you will get 10% off your first
[43:32.120 --> 43:33.520]  purchase when you do it.
[43:33.520 --> 43:34.520]  So just keep it in mind.
[43:34.520 --> 43:39.320]  Next time you need to build a website, go to Squarespace first and remember that code Gruber.
[43:39.320 --> 43:40.320]  All right.
[43:40.320 --> 43:41.640]  So I want to talk about this.
[43:41.640 --> 43:44.400]  I wrote, touched on this in my review.
[43:44.400 --> 43:48.200]  And more and more, I think, if I continue writing about the iPad Pro, I think it's the
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.840]  main thing I want to write about.
[43:49.840 --> 43:54.000]  I love the pencil, but I feel like because I'm not an artist, it's not really for me to
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.520]  go into depth about it.
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.760]  But I do use a keyboard sometimes.
[43:59.760 --> 44:05.160]  And I, it really, the more I think about it, the more it drives me crazy, that this is not
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.800]  more deeply integrated into the iPad.
[44:09.800 --> 44:11.000]  And here's what I'm thinking.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.680]  I think it comes down to, all right.
[44:13.680 --> 44:19.600]  And they first made the iPhone and they said, Steve Jobs is up on stage, and he's talking
[44:19.600 --> 44:21.000]  about what they did.
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.200]  And he says, it runs OS 10.
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.400]  And it's this, you know, for years and years and years, everybody who, you know, we'd
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.840]  had this, this, what if Apple could do a stripped down version of Mac OS that would run
[44:30.840 --> 44:31.840]  on a smaller device?
[44:31.840 --> 44:37.520]  I mean, I say Mac OS because I would say that the dream of a quote unquote stripped down
[44:37.520 --> 44:42.880]  Mac OS that runs on a handheld device even predates Mac OS 10.
[44:42.880 --> 44:43.880]  And here it is.
[44:43.880 --> 44:44.880]  They've finally done it.
[44:44.880 --> 44:48.080]  And it's, you know, it's, wow.
[44:48.080 --> 44:49.080]  How did they do it?
[44:49.080 --> 44:51.480]  And it's not by running Mac apps, right?
[44:51.480 --> 44:56.920]  And there's no menu bar, it's like they went back to ground zero and rethought the entire
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.880]  user interface.
[44:58.880 --> 45:06.280]  And there are certain things that carried over, like the idea that there's an app and
[45:06.280 --> 45:10.400]  to launch the app, you know, would you double click on the Mac, you just tap it on the
[45:10.400 --> 45:12.160]  phone very similar.
[45:12.160 --> 45:13.720]  Other things very different, right?
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.320]  Like buttons were the same, like a push button, you tap, what do you do with a push
[45:17.320 --> 45:18.320]  button?
[45:18.320 --> 45:21.160]  Well, the same obvious thing you do on a Mac, you know, what you would click on the Mac,
[45:21.160 --> 45:22.720]  you tap here.
[45:22.720 --> 45:25.920]  Other things though, very different.
[45:25.920 --> 45:31.800]  I feel like with the iPad and to me, especially with the iPad Pro and when it's hooked
[45:31.800 --> 45:39.560]  up to a keyboard, if all you did was lock up some good designers and say, here's the form
[45:39.560 --> 45:40.560]  factor.
[45:40.560 --> 45:48.880]  Finish the hardware, it's this 12 inch piece of glass with a touch screen and it has this
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.000]  incredible resolution and here's the keyboard it can connect to.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.760]  What does the user interface look like to this?
[45:55.760 --> 45:57.520]  Like what is the home screen?
[45:57.520 --> 46:01.040]  What's the root level like when you're just starting?
[46:01.040 --> 46:08.000]  I don't think anybody would come up with what the iPad home screen looks like.
[46:08.000 --> 46:15.720]  It's so clearly like when the iPhone was not the Mac, you know, what we think of as macOS
[46:15.720 --> 46:20.600]  just shrunk down to fit on the screen with a menu bar at the top and little draggable windows.
[46:20.600 --> 46:22.480]  That's exactly what they've done with the iPad though.
[46:22.480 --> 46:27.120]  They've just taken the phone interface and moved it to this new thing and now that it's
[46:27.120 --> 46:32.560]  more capable and now that it's, it really is fast enough to be like treated as a Mac,
[46:32.560 --> 46:38.800]  I feel like it's almost painful that Apple hasn't been more ambitious with the interface
[46:38.800 --> 46:39.800]  to this.
[46:39.800 --> 46:46.560]  Well, I think this goes back to, you know, this is the iPhone OS, right?
[46:46.560 --> 46:50.880]  It's the iPhone OS and it was formulated for a very small screen and when they took it
[46:50.880 --> 46:55.280]  up to the iPad, they didn't do a lot to change it other than to say, you know, you've
[46:55.280 --> 47:00.560]  got more room to spread out your interface and we've gone with that iOS 9 shows some
[47:00.560 --> 47:04.320]  signs, right, that they're like, oh, we need to really address this now.
[47:04.320 --> 47:10.000]  But it took them, people are out there using keyboards on this thing for years and got
[47:10.000 --> 47:16.280]  very little support beyond the most rudimentary like, yes, we will support Bluetooth keyboards.
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.720]  And it's only with iOS 9 that they really have been kicked into gear and so they're
[47:20.720 --> 47:22.120]  kind of behind in it.
[47:22.120 --> 47:29.320]  But you're right, it's not the interface that you would build for this device.
[47:29.320 --> 47:32.960]  It's an interface that's evolved from the original iPhone essentially.
[47:32.960 --> 47:34.560]  And there's still parts of it that haven't evolved very much.
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.840]  I mean, the springboard, the home screen is not evolved essentially at all.
[47:39.840 --> 47:43.120]  And there are lots of other parts that on the iPad Pro, it's just sort of a stretched
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.840]  out version of what was on the iPad Air.
[47:45.840 --> 47:52.080]  So, you know, it's, I don't know, I've seen people suggest that they ought to make, you
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.960]  know, they ought to consider this, you know, iPad OS and that it's something that needs
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.840]  to be, whether you call it something different or not, it needs more investment into features
[48:02.840 --> 48:07.360]  that only matter for the iPad that it's, on one level, it's totally understandable.
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.760]  The iPhone is so huge that you want to devote so much iOS development time to features
[48:11.760 --> 48:13.160]  that the iPhone will use.
[48:13.160 --> 48:20.400]  But I wonder sometimes if it's a self fulfilling prophecy a little bit that the iPad isn't
[48:20.400 --> 48:26.320]  growing because they aren't putting the work in and making it more of a product than it
[48:26.320 --> 48:27.320]  could be.
[48:27.320 --> 48:31.280]  And, you know, it's always the iPhone that gets the priority, it seems, except with these
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.520]  new features in iOS 9, it's felt like, you know, it really is about the iPhone and the
[48:35.520 --> 48:37.560]  iPad is lucky to kind of come along.
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.520]  And the iPad Pro could be a lot better if there were more features that took advantage
[48:41.520 --> 48:43.440]  of things like an external keyboard.
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.600]  And I'm not saying it needs a mouse and drop down menus, which, you know, because then
[48:48.600 --> 48:50.800]  it's a Mac, but more than it's got now.
[48:50.800 --> 48:51.800]  All right.
[48:51.800 --> 48:55.560]  I definitely think that a mouse pointer is not the right way to go.
[48:55.560 --> 49:02.520]  I feel like that's this, I'm fully on board with exactly, you know, what Apple's executives,
[49:02.520 --> 49:07.680]  you know, Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, I think even Eddie in a couple of interviews, Eddie
[49:07.680 --> 49:08.680]  Q.
[49:08.680 --> 49:10.600]  I really, I don't think it's spin.
[49:10.600 --> 49:12.400]  I think they truly believe this.
[49:12.400 --> 49:18.440]  And I do too that the Mac and iPad OS are not going to converge.
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.240]  There's not going to be any sort of point in the foreseeable future.
[49:22.240 --> 49:27.960]  I mean, like years and years out where everything is just one OS and you can touch your
[49:27.960 --> 49:29.200]  iMac 5K.
[49:29.200 --> 49:35.560]  I really think that it, and I think the mouse pointer interface isn't going anywhere.
[49:35.560 --> 49:42.160]  And that's an Apple world that's called the Mac and the touch interfaces I'm going anywhere.
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.000]  But there needs to be some kind of directional input that's not touching the screen.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.920]  And I think, you know, Apple TV shows how that's possible, right?
[49:49.920 --> 49:57.200]  And I know that it's, even the old Apple TV, which just had the, with no swipe pad, it
[49:57.200 --> 50:00.160]  just had up down left, right, you know, you could do it.
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.400]  And I feel like the new one with the touch pad, it even shows even more how possible it
[50:05.400 --> 50:06.400]  is.
[50:06.400 --> 50:10.280]  And this focus engine that they have where it, you have these selections and it just shows
[50:10.280 --> 50:11.760]  you based on the depth.
[50:11.760 --> 50:15.480]  I'm not saying that that's exactly what they could move to the iPad because then I don't
[50:15.480 --> 50:18.560]  think it would work with touch, right?
[50:18.560 --> 50:22.680]  I think if they put the focus engine UI on the iPad for use with the keyboard with like
[50:22.680 --> 50:27.720]  the arrow keys or with the track pad, a track pad that isn't there.
[50:27.720 --> 50:33.160]  But if they added the hypothetical track pad, you could do the focus, the focus thing would
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.320]  definitely work.
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.560]  And I think that would be pretty useful.
[50:35.560 --> 50:39.880]  And then you could use the track pad to move the insertion point around in text editing
[50:39.880 --> 50:40.880]  views.
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.200]  And all of that would work and be useful and not introduce a mouse pointer, which I think
[50:44.200 --> 50:47.200]  is problematic in a lot of ways.
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.800]  Yeah, I mean that in some ways the track pads are already there, right?
[50:51.800 --> 50:57.240]  Because if you put two fingers down on the software keyboard, you can move the text insertion
[50:57.240 --> 50:58.240]  around.
[50:58.240 --> 50:59.400]  And so there is a pointing device.
[50:59.400 --> 51:04.920]  It's not a cursor that's available everywhere, but it is there.
[51:04.920 --> 51:09.800]  And in that way, if you're using an external keyboard, you lose that feature.
[51:09.800 --> 51:10.960]  And there isn't the support.
[51:10.960 --> 51:14.000]  I was arguing with somebody on Twitter, I think you were part of that chain too, about
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.200]  this idea of a track pad on a keyboard from Apple, which I think is less likely.
[51:20.200 --> 51:24.840]  But I kind of feel like they might as well just support Bluetooth track pads because just
[51:24.840 --> 51:28.440]  for text insertion, because it's not as if it's not there, the alternative would be something
[51:28.440 --> 51:34.160]  like I think it was a patent for a keyboard, an Apple patent for a keyboard that you could
[51:34.160 --> 51:37.200]  also just move your finger across.
[51:37.200 --> 51:42.480]  And it would act like a track pad, which that's how the software keyboard works.
[51:42.480 --> 51:45.840]  So if you had a hardware keyboard that you could do that, that might solve it too.
[51:45.840 --> 51:49.400]  It's like, look, if you want to move the insertion point around, you don't push down
[51:49.400 --> 51:54.240]  on the keys, you just drag your fingers over them, and that's close enough for us to
[51:54.240 --> 51:55.240]  figure out what you're doing.
[51:55.240 --> 51:59.680]  So maybe there's something there, because it doesn't get enough publicity, but that's
[51:59.680 --> 52:04.120]  like one of the biggest breaks with the iOS interface metaphor that has ever been is
[52:04.120 --> 52:07.720]  the idea that suddenly you've got a little cursor that you move around on screen.
[52:07.720 --> 52:11.400]  That's not something that we've really had on iOS before.
[52:11.400 --> 52:15.080]  And once that's out of the box a little bit, and I think it's great for productivity,
[52:15.080 --> 52:17.040]  I think it's fantastic on the iPad Pro.
[52:17.040 --> 52:21.840]  It's the easiest movement of that, I find it harder to move around on the iPhone and on
[52:21.840 --> 52:25.720]  the smaller iPads, but it's really good because you've got that space, and it totally
[52:25.720 --> 52:26.720]  works.
[52:26.720 --> 52:30.920]  So, you know, I'd like to see more of that in more places, plus simple stuff like, if
[52:30.920 --> 52:35.000]  I do a spotlight search, I can't arrow down into one of the results.
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.640]  I can't help but feel that that's just, that's just coming, it has to be coming.
[52:39.640 --> 52:40.640]  Sure.
[52:40.640 --> 52:45.040]  So, I think a lot of these are very clearly like they're very close and they're just
[52:45.040 --> 52:46.880]  not quite there yet.
[52:46.880 --> 52:48.120]  Auto-correct is one.
[52:48.120 --> 52:53.400]  I just wrote a piece about this yesterday on the iPad Pro for Macworld, where Auto-correct
[52:53.400 --> 52:56.800]  is one where there's this whole Auto-correct system that's been built up for the software
[52:56.800 --> 53:00.480]  keyboard, because it's really important for the software keyboard.
[53:00.480 --> 53:05.040]  But right now there's no system level way to assign Auto-correct on or off for hardware
[53:05.040 --> 53:08.920]  versus software keyboards, so every time I use a hardware keyboard I have to go turn it
[53:08.920 --> 53:12.560]  off because it is terrible when I'm using the hardware keyboard.
[53:12.560 --> 53:16.440]  It corrects things that I type correctly into other things and I type so fast that I go
[53:16.440 --> 53:17.440]  right over it.
[53:17.440 --> 53:22.200]  My incidence of typos goes up, I'm correcting things all the time, and it's just one
[53:22.200 --> 53:24.600]  of those things that like, that's a pretty simple thing.
[53:24.600 --> 53:28.480]  I don't know, again, I don't know how deep into the text code, maybe it would be hard
[53:28.480 --> 53:33.160]  to implement, but from a user perspective it's like, it makes sense that my rules for
[53:33.160 --> 53:37.720]  my software keyboard and my hardware keyboard would be, would be different, and it goes
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.600]  to the Auto-capitalization stuff, I don't know if you've tried this, but if you hold
[53:42.600 --> 53:44.280]  down the Shift key a little too long.
[53:44.280 --> 53:48.640]  So the first two letters of a word are capitalized, and you're like, oh, I meant that to
[53:48.640 --> 53:49.880]  be lowercase.
[53:49.880 --> 53:53.880]  You lift the Shift key off, you backspace, and then you type the key again on the iPad,
[53:53.880 --> 53:58.400]  it just stays in capital letters, because it's because of the iPhone, and that's been a
[53:58.400 --> 54:02.160]  problem from the iPhone since the beginning, which is like, no, no, you toggle the Shift
[54:02.160 --> 54:07.400]  key up, you probably want to type a capital letter here, and- Right, like, I'm sure you said
[54:07.400 --> 54:11.920]  it's spoken about this, where when you get to know in a rich text editing interface,
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.960]  like word or text edit, where there's bold in italics and underline, there are implicit
[54:17.960 --> 54:23.760]  invisible marks effectively, and in the old days, like when we used to write on our
[54:23.760 --> 54:25.760]  Apple twos, you could see them.
[54:25.760 --> 54:32.760]  Right.
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.000]  But in other words, if I start typing Jason, and I type, for whatever stupid reason, I just
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.520]  want the first two letters to be bold.
[54:42.520 --> 54:47.040]  If I go back and delete the A that's bold, and I type it again, it's still going to
[54:47.040 --> 54:51.160]  be bold until I hit Command B again, before I type it, right?
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.400]  And it's the Shift key is like that on iOS, the Shift key is sort of like an invisible
[54:55.400 --> 54:58.280]  marker in there.
[54:58.280 --> 55:01.000]  It's like a mode that you go into and stays on.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.320]  Yeah, and it's, I mean, that's just a bug, right?
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.200]  I mean, it's really just a bug, but it stems from the fact that there's this whole
[55:10.200 --> 55:15.280]  infrastructure of input that has been built up around the iPhone originally, and then
[55:15.280 --> 55:18.200]  the iPad, and the external keyboard thing is just kind of this weird thing that's
[55:18.200 --> 55:22.560]  crafted on, which in the context of the time made sense, but when you're trying to think
[55:22.560 --> 55:27.560]  of this as more of a productivity device, and that a lot of people are going to be using
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.320]  a keyboard that Apple sells a keyboard now, you know, it's all stuff that just needs
[55:31.320 --> 55:32.320]  to be better.
[55:32.320 --> 55:33.800]  And I keep coming back to the iOS 9 thing.
[55:33.800 --> 55:38.120]  I feel like what the real story here is just that Apple already has gotten the religion
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.920]  about this, but they didn't really get it until iOS 9.
[55:41.920 --> 55:44.880]  And then before then, they sort of just kept their hands off of it.
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.880]  And then since they only got that religion for iOS 9, they haven't had time to build
[55:49.880 --> 55:50.880]  this stuff.
[55:50.880 --> 55:54.720]  I'm hoping to see a little more of it in the build of iOS that ran on the iPad Pro,
[55:54.720 --> 55:59.920]  and I'm still hopeful that maybe 9.2, maybe 9.3, we'll just see this stuff trickling
[55:59.920 --> 56:02.440]  out instead of having to wait for an iOS 10.
[56:02.440 --> 56:07.880]  But you know, that's the optimist in me is that I feel like maybe they have got it, right?
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.040]  They've got the product out there.
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.440]  They've got that keyboard, and they do know that this is important to the iPad Pro,
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.720]  and that they're going to prioritize more of these features to make it better.
[56:17.720 --> 56:23.720]  I think that one of the most telling thing, and to me, it contrasts with this episode
[56:23.720 --> 56:27.120]  of the show almost, it looks like it was organized.
[56:27.120 --> 56:32.720]  I think it contrasts so poorly with the pencil, where to me, every aspect of the pencil
[56:32.720 --> 56:41.400]  seems so thoughtful, but the thing is, is that the pencil is this all new thing that slips
[56:41.400 --> 56:49.080]  into the touch world established by the iPhone, I'm not speaking, but like the 2007 iPhone,
[56:49.080 --> 56:51.480]  in theory would work great with the pencil, right?
[56:51.480 --> 56:59.400]  And my guess is that going forward, all future iOS devices will be have the touch sensor
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.680]  that the iPad Pro does, and will work with the pencil, at least they could.
[57:03.680 --> 57:05.400]  And at least all iPads, I think.
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.400]  I don't know, maybe not the phone, but I don't see why not with the phone.
[57:09.400 --> 57:10.400]  I don't quite.
[57:10.400 --> 57:13.800]  And it's not the iPad, you know, Apple Pencil for iPad Pro or something like that, it's
[57:13.800 --> 57:15.360]  the Apple Pencil period.
[57:15.360 --> 57:21.800]  But it doesn't force any kind of rethinking of the interface, of the touch-centric interface.
[57:21.800 --> 57:23.000]  It's all on new.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.440]  Whereas the keyboard is so in conflict with that, and not that I don't think, I think
[57:28.440 --> 57:34.320]  that in theory, there's a way to arrive at a, this works just as well with the touch
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.680]  and the keyboard, but you know, it different ways, and I'll give you an example of that in
[57:38.680 --> 57:39.680]  a second.
[57:39.680 --> 57:46.880]  The other example, and it just reeks to me of the, wait a second, didn't somebody think
[57:46.880 --> 57:47.960]  that this is crazy.
[57:47.960 --> 57:53.040]  So in theory, if you have the hardware keyboard attached, typing should be better in every
[57:53.040 --> 57:56.680]  way, because it's an actual keyboard.
[57:56.680 --> 58:03.040]  Or at least, or if in theory you are the world's, a world class type on the iPad screen
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.240]  typist, then it should be at least as good.
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.680]  But in a huge way, it's worse, because when you're using the on-screen keyboard, you can
[58:11.680 --> 58:14.120]  put two fingers down and move the insertion point.
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.000]  And which, you know, you just spent three minutes praising, I'll just say ditto, it's one
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.920]  of the greatest inventions of the touch screen era.
[58:21.920 --> 58:25.360]  And then if you have the hardware keyboard, there's no way to do that.
[58:25.360 --> 58:32.000]  Yeah, I find that to be absolutely crazy that it just be, and again, whether it, you know,
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.680]  I'm not saying it's an easy thing to solve, it's, you know, like you said, maybe it's
[58:35.680 --> 58:41.560]  some kind of weird patented material that turns the surface of the keyboard into a touch
[58:41.560 --> 58:45.800]  pad sensor just for going, just for just for moving around, you don't have to do anything
[58:45.800 --> 58:46.800]  else.
[58:46.800 --> 58:52.400]  I don't know what the answer is, but boy, that seems crazy that you get this really
[58:52.400 --> 58:54.440]  cool feature with the on-screen keyboard.
[58:54.440 --> 58:58.880]  And when you hook up a hardware keyboard, you completely lose it.
[58:58.880 --> 59:09.160]  So the other example, the other, and this one really bothers me, is for command tab.
[59:09.160 --> 59:16.200]  So the command tab that they've added to iOS is just, it looks exactly like the max command
[59:16.200 --> 59:23.040]  tab, which in and of itself, not, you know, okay, it's familiar, your apps start with,
[59:23.040 --> 59:26.720]  they go left to right with left is your current most app.
[59:26.720 --> 59:33.360]  And then as you move to the right, you see your, the apps you've used in whatever, you
[59:33.360 --> 59:35.160]  know, the order in which you've used them.
[59:35.160 --> 59:39.440]  So one command tab gets you to the one you used most recently to get you to the second most
[59:39.440 --> 59:44.600]  recent, et cetera.
[59:44.600 --> 59:50.600]  But there's the double tap, the home button switcher, which provides the exact same tab,
[59:50.600 --> 59:55.160]  the exact same, solves the exact same problem, which is I want to switch to them a recently
[59:55.160 --> 59:56.720]  used app.
[59:56.720 --> 59:59.160]  But on iOS, it's completely different.
[59:59.160 --> 1:00:00.160]  It looks different.
[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:03.280]  It's this 3D stacked view.
[1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:12.360]  And it even goes in a different order, starting with Mac OS 9, it goes from right to left.
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:21.440]  But they had a left to right version in iOS 7 and 8 with the old card style interface.
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:25.520]  To me, as a general principle, there's absolutely no reason why that shouldn't be the exact
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:29.760]  same interface, whether you're using command tab or using the screen and double clicking
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:31.160]  the home button.
[1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:34.560]  It should be the, and they had it, they had it right there.
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:37.480]  They had the iOS 8 switcher.
[1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:42.960]  And I think the only reason they switched it for iOS 9 was for the iPhone 6S with the
[1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:48.720]  force touch where you can force from the edge.
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:52.320]  And I don't think that that's, I don't think that's worth it.
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:55.840]  I feel like maybe they should have just made it so that you, instead of force touching
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:00.560]  from the left edge, you have to do it from the right edge so that the order could be the
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:02.440]  same between the two.
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:03.440]  I don't know.
[1:01:03.440 --> 1:01:08.640]  But somehow, if they wanted to add the force touch switcher, they should have done it in
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:13.800]  a way that they could use the same switcher for double tap homes, go from the edge, and
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.280]  definitely from command tab.
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.400]  The command tab switcher should be the same as the double tap the home button switcher.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:24.280]  And it's, it's, it's, to me, a lack of thoughtfulness that, that it's not so.
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:28.880]  Well, I mean, it is more dense to have just the icons up there and not the previews.
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:32.880]  And if they had it, you know, although you could have that same sort of stack of, you know,
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:37.800]  angled textures of what those apps were or something, I'm sure, I'm sure they could
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.440]  unify it if they really wanted to.
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:45.680]  But it's funny when you think about Apple taking the approach that each device is its own
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:46.680]  thing.
[1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:50.200]  And unlike Microsoft's approach, the Mac is going to be the Mac and the iPad is going to
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:51.520]  be the iPad.
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:56.280]  This is a case where when you've got an external keyboard attached, the iPad kind of
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:01.080]  is a Mac sort of, it's using the Mac switcher instead of, and I don't know whether that's
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:05.200]  a good thing because the people depends on if you're attitude is people who use external
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.480]  keyboards are fossils, they're old people who want the old ways and we're, this is providing
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.120]  some continuity for our users who are less comfortable with the new ways of text input,
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:20.160]  or whether, you know, it's just a, a nice accessory for people who want to input text
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:21.160]  faster.
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:25.520]  And, and if it's the former, then the app switcher makes sense because it'll scare them
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:26.520]  less.
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:30.840]  But it's not the same metaphor as the rest of the system, it's this bizarre thing that
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:33.000]  kind of got imported from the Mac.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.200]  Yeah, and it just, in a way, it's, it, I'm glad that it's there, you know, and I'm glad
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:44.640]  that while I've been trying to use my iPad Pro as, as, you know, like how much of my work
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:49.160]  can I do on a, you know, to try this thing out, I'm certainly glad that Command Tab works.
[1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:50.160]  Oh yeah.
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.240]  But I think that just stick, we'll just stick a Mac style switcher in there is crazy when
[1:02:55.240 --> 1:03:00.480]  they, especially when, when iOS 8 had a, had a, a switching, an app switching metaphor
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.680]  that would have worked perfectly with Command Tab.
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.120]  And I really think that that's a lot slicker and I feel like it really, I feel like the
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:15.000]  beauty of it is an even the new iOS 9 switcher still has the same quality where you can
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.440]  see the apps as you're switching between them.
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:23.000]  And that doesn't really translate well to the Mac because Mac apps can have lots and lots
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:29.120]  of windows open, but an every single iOS app only has one screen at a current time.
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:33.640]  And I feel like the visual aspect of that where it's like a layer of abstraction has been
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:39.760]  removed and you actually see the apps Safari looks like the currently showing Safari
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:47.680]  tab is, is so much more iOS like it's so much more what iOS is supposed to be rather
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:53.080]  than this extra layer of abstraction where Safari is represented by its home screen icon.
[1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:59.000]  Yeah, and I, I don't even want to get into that when you've got two apps running and split
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:04.920]  view the switcher is the iOS based switcher is even weirder because I think the split view
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.560]  on the right just sort of vanishes.
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:12.040]  Yeah, because it's a little what it show and what it show with the split view or what
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:16.600]  it show the last time it wasn't in split view and it's a, there's a lot going on and you
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:20.400]  do get the sense you set it and I had, I had been thinking it you do get the sense that
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:24.920]  there was a long debated Apple about the app switcher stuff and about productivity for
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:28.760]  keyboard people and at some point somebody said look, just put the Mac app switcher in
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:34.600]  there for the keyboard people just, it's good enough of them.
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:40.560]  So hopefully there are people and it's just, hopefully that it's just some sort of look
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:44.240]  we, you know, we can ship this big iPad now we're ready to do it.
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:52.920]  We have the I think and again, this is the sort of thing that even when you know people
[1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:57.880]  at Apple and friends and they just don't like to talk about timelines, but I think
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:03.240]  that the iPad pro has been something that they've been thinking about ever since they started
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:11.080]  working on the iPad in terms of what size of these devices would we like to ship and having
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:16.240]  to make something that's this big but is ways as little as it does, right, because think
[1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:19.360]  about the fact that the original iPad, you know, famously now everybody says, you
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:23.640]  know, talking about the weight of the iPad pro, ways almost exactly the same as the original
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:24.720]  iPad.
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:31.080]  Well then obviously at this size back in 2010, it would have been way too heavy.
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.080]  Yeah.
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:33.080]  Right.
[1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:37.760]  Because it would have been as thick and as dense as that iPad and now it's heavier.
[1:05:37.760 --> 1:05:41.480]  So it took them a while to be able to make something that was this big and it would be
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:47.080]  tolerable weight and it clearly once they've gone to the retina era, they ran into these
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:51.480]  it incredibly difficult things with the graphics to be able to drive a screen this
[1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:52.960]  size that's retina.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:56.920]  You know, they had to do the same thing with this that they did with the retina 5k iMac
[1:05:56.920 --> 1:06:00.640]  where they have their own timing controller to control the whole thing because nothing on
[1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:02.440]  the market could drive that many pixels.
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:03.440]  Yeah.
[1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:11.760]  Well I think that this year, I think 2015, they've shipped a big iPad the first year that
[1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:16.760]  they could have that, you know, with all the engineering constraints that they had to work
[1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:21.200]  with to be able to ship something that meets their definition for, you know, here's
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:25.240]  an, here's what we could, we would be willing to ship as an iOS device to make one
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  this size.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:27.480]  It took until now.
[1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:30.520]  And because they could do it now, they're shipping it now.
[1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:35.360]  Even though the software on the software side clearly, they're not caught up to the level
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:38.520]  of, well, what could we do with an iPad of this size?
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:39.520]  Yeah.
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:43.560]  I think that's exactly right that this is, this feels like, like I was saying, like I,
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:48.040]  with iOS 9 and with the putting the iPad pro into getting it ready for production, there
[1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:51.440]  was a moment of like, okay, this matters to us now and the problem was that they weren't
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:56.240]  laying the foundation before and you can't, you can't turn on a dime and add all those
[1:06:56.240 --> 1:06:57.240]  features in.
[1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:01.000]  The software is lagging behind and it's a shame that it wasn't.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.800]  You also feel like the iPad Air 2 was so over-specced that that was almost like the,
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:10.200]  but in the pilot program, but the iPad pro a little bit, it was like, whoa, where did this
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:11.200]  thing come from?
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.200]  It's like, oh, I understand now.
[1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:16.840]  But the hardware is spectacular, it really is a great piece of hardware.
[1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:20.640]  And that's why I think it is striking that we come back to, the software kind of has
[1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:24.920]  them caught up and it's not just like, there's the whole other debate about professional
[1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:31.280]  software in the app store and all of that, but like iOS itself is kind of just, it's
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:37.360]  a little bit behind what the hardware can offer and it's, it's not surprising because
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:42.800]  I think they, they got a late start because it wasn't a priority until, until they decided
[1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:47.840]  I wonder, you know, I really wish I would be fascinated to know the stories behind it.
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:51.800]  I keep, my gut feeling is also that Apple has changed its philosophy about its product
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:56.760]  lines where it feels that they don't have to be as focused, that every product doesn't
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:58.400]  have to be for every person.
[1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:03.800]  And I think that evidence one of that was the existence of the iPhone six plus where it
[1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:04.800]  was not the flagship.
[1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:09.360]  It was this oversized phone and I think that Apple felt bitten by the fact that they
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:13.920]  were so maniacally focused on having one iPhone that they got behind in the large phone
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:17.880]  category and Samsung showed them that people wanted that.
[1:08:17.880 --> 1:08:21.200]  And I wonder if that bleeds down to the iPad a little bit too and it gives them the freedom
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:25.600]  to have this product exist where it's like, look, we can have a bunch of different iPads
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.480]  and, you know, the mini was the first example of that.
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:31.360]  And then this is another example where it's like, look, we can have a lot of these iPads.
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:34.800]  We can't ship them all the same year because it's too much but we have to ship like
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:36.920]  a couple, one or two a year.
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.480]  But I wonder if there's a story there that maybe it's just me seeing things but I feel
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:46.000]  like there's something there about Apple shifting gears from sort of like this is the
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.680]  iPhone just saying we have many iPhones you can choose from.
[1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:54.520]  And many iPads choose the one you like and that's not where they were two, three years
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.440]  ago but that's where they are now.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:04.440]  Yeah, it's a fascinating device, the iPad Pro and Pencil and the keyboard and there's
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:11.600]  so much to think about and but it is as interested and fascinated in it as I am, I think
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:19.800]  you're exactly right is that it is the device I would recommend to the fewest people for
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:22.840]  like one of their big things.
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:32.360]  I guess the only thing, I think the iPhone plus the 6S plus and 6 Plus are similar but
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:34.440]  even maybe even a little bit less.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:39.880]  I feel like it's the people who want the plus size phone, they know it, it's just a gut
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.280]  feeling, if your gut says I wish my phone was really big then go ahead and get it.
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:49.400]  Whereas this is a little bit, it's a little bit more complicated, like I don't, I really
[1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:56.160]  don't think it's not just an issue of like in the old days I think it used to be in
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:00.360]  the power book days.
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:04.080]  The only reason to get like, you know, the old, you know, back when we used to call them
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:10.600]  I books, remember that, or even the MacBook, the only reason to get one other than a MacBook
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:17.120]  Pro was I think, you know, about cost, you know, if you can afford the MacBook Pro, you're
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:19.960]  going to want that MacBook Pro because you're not really saving much else.
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:24.640]  It wasn't like they were lighter, you know, or thinner, they were just slower.
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:28.800]  Now the only time I had a MacBook was there was the period where there was the MacBooks
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:33.920]  were smaller and the MacBook Pros were not smaller and that was the reason to get it
[1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:36.120]  was you want a smaller laptop.
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:37.120]  We've got it.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.520]  But if all other things are equal, then I don't know, do you think that iPad Pro is a little
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:46.640]  bit like the old 17 inch MacBook, right, where it's sort of like, who wants this?
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:49.560]  And the answer is, there are some people who really want this.
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.400]  But most people are probably not going to land.
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.080]  You could do the industries and with the iPad Pro it will be different industries, but
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.640]  you could say, you know, people who do want to do video editing, this might actually
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:01.040]  be on the road, this might actually be great for it because it's got the big screen.
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:06.880]  People who want to, who want to draw a graphic artist and comic book artists and colorists
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:12.080]  and all sorts of different jobs with the pencil and the giant screen, perfect.
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:19.120]  And like a thousand other niches plus the power user type people who can do their whole
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  jobs with it.
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:22.080]  And then over time maybe it becomes more than that.
[1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.320]  But that's my gut feeling now is like, yeah, like a Federico, I mean, he's the, he's the
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:27.720]  poster boy for it, right?
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:31.240]  And I think there are other people and, and you know, yeah, people who just like having
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:34.960]  their iPad and realize they've got office on there and that's all they need.
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:37.800]  I think it will find lots of surprising audiences.
[1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.160]  I'm really looking forward to actually in the next six months.
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.360]  There will probably be a lot of stories about, oh, did you realize the iPad Pro is actually
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:47.920]  great for X and you'd be like, oh, that is, of course, it makes perfect sense.
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:51.200]  I didn't think of it at the time, but it's a perfect product for that.
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:53.560]  But you know, that 17 inch power book was like that too.
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:54.560]  It waited a ton.
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:55.560]  It was huge.
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:59.960]  And the people who wanted it, it was in the priceless forever because they, people just
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:04.480]  did not want to give up the 17 inch in certain audiences.
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:08.440]  And it wasn't really until, you know, the finally the 15 was so powerful and the 15 with
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:14.240]  retina and all of that that it, it was no longer the cafeteria tray laptop was no longer
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  relevant.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:16.240]  Yeah.
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:20.680]  I think it's maybe that's, it's probably the 17 inch power book or no, I guess, did that?
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:21.680]  Yeah, there was a Mac.
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:22.680]  Yeah.
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:26.320]  This one was still, was a MacBook, they definitely had Intel versions.
[1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:27.320]  Yeah.
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:30.320]  I think that's probably a little bit more niche than the iPad Pro, but I think it's
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:34.640]  along that spectrum though, that you kind of need to have an exceptional need to justify
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:35.640]  it.
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:36.640]  I agree.
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:40.200]  It's not as expensive compared to the other products, I think, and it is not as kind of
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:41.200]  unreasonable.
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:45.680]  It's big and some people are going to get turned off by its bigness, but, you know,
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:49.680]  there are other people from having the bigger screen, you know, it's just going to be,
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:50.680]  it's going to be good.
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:51.680]  It's an iPad, right?
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:55.600]  All other ways it is an iPad, and it's got this big, bright, beautiful screen.
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:00.920]  And if you don't care about the weight and the size of it, you know, it, it does, it does
[1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:01.920]  what it says.
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:02.920]  It is a big iPad.
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:08.000]  I loved, I linked to it and even said, it was just my favorite observation, I'm the one
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.400]  person's observation about the iPad Pro that I was jealous of that I didn't think of
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:16.400]  was Horace that Jews, that it's a desktop iPad.
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.760]  Not desktop meaning like it runs desktop, you know, desktop to get so overused, because
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.800]  that's what we mean when we say Mac and Windows.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:24.800]  Right.
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.480]  But he just meant literally that you put it on a desk and it's meant to be used.
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.080]  And so much of what we do now on desktops is actually a laptop.
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.400]  Right.
[1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:38.200]  I thought that was, I thought that was so keen and I have to say in all my time, and
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:41.440]  you know, again, when you're doing these things and you, you know, you're in an R
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:44.600]  racket and you want to write like a review of this thing, you do, you spend an, I spend
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:49.560]  an awful lot of time on it in the, you know, especially that first week where I had the
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:53.240]  review in it, and I did everything on it.
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.520]  Even things that I knew while I was doing it like, wow, I'm the long run, I am not going
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:59.080]  to do, I'm not going to use this to do this.
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:02.920]  But I was doing it just to see what it was like and I really have to say that the stuff
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:08.640]  that I usually do with an iPad on a normal day, just sit there at the end of the day and
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:14.000]  just sort of, if I'm watching sports on TV and I'm just paying attention to Twitter on
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:18.520]  the other, you know, this quote unquote second screen and I'm on the couch, the, the big
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:21.480]  iPad pro is cumbersome.
[1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:22.760]  It's hard to hold in one hand.
[1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:27.480]  I mean, it's, this is not like something that you couldn't foresee, but it's kind of
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:34.320]  wants to be used on a desk or like on your lap with the keyboard attached so that it's
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.400]  resting on it.
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.080]  And that's to me is different than from what most people I think do with, with their
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:41.080]  iPad.
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:42.080]  Yeah.
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:47.200]  Everybody's ergonomics are going to be different, but, but it feels, it feels comfortable.
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:51.320]  Yeah, on a table, on a desk, it's totally comfortable.
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:56.760]  I, I think sitting up, it is, for me, ergonomically, it's fine if I'm sitting upright
[1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:00.760]  on in a chair or even on my couch in my living room.
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:04.440]  When I'm leaning back, like I'm, I'm laying on the couch or I'm laying in bed and I'm
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:08.440]  like checking email in the morning or something like that, it's kind of ridiculous.
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:13.080]  I can get used to it, but it's like, it probably doesn't fit as well there and I'm not
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:17.120]  sure people really want to have two iPads right there, like they're, they're big iPad
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:19.640]  and they're small iPad, but it almost comes across like that.
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:22.960]  This is not an iPad you, you use everywhere probably.
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:29.080]  Yeah, and it doesn't, it does seem like in some ways Apple is sort of optimizing for
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.600]  the case where you're going to, you're going to have a whole house full of Apple products
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:38.680]  and just pick the one that you know, downstairs, you know, I like that, like the daytime
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:43.680]  night time iPhone guy, you're going to have an upstairs iPad and a, you know, downstairs
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:51.160]  iPad, which is terrible, it's so gratuitous, but I do kind of feel that way.
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:56.560]  All right, let me take another break here and thank another one of our long time friends
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:16:03.360]  of the show, the good folks at Warby Parker, Warby Parker believes that prescription
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:09.040]  eyeglasses simply should not cost $300 or more. They bypass their traditional channels
[1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:15.480]  and they sell high quality, great looking prescription eyeglasses direct to you at a fraction
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:21.440]  of the usual retail prices, starting at just $95 and you can go from there and there's,
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:24.840]  you know, you get the person, the lenses that go darker or something like that and it costs
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:28.000]  a little more and that buy vocals cost more.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:33.880]  But 95 bucks is a starting price for a regular pair of glasses and that comes with everything.
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:39.280]  They don't upsell you on anti reflective coatings or anti glare.
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:43.720]  They don't make you pay more for the good polycarbonate material that the lenses are made
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.120]  out of. They all come with that by default. They even come with nice cases and a nice cleaning
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:53.960]  cloth and just really, really great stuff buying eyeglasses online sounds crazy, right?
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:58.040]  Everybody or most people I know are really super picky about something that they're going
[1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:03.520]  to put on their face and how do you get around that? Well, you go to their website and
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:07.640]  they've got some really cool tools. You can use webcam or just upload a picture of yourself
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:12.160]  and you can preview what some of the glasses will look like on your face. They even have
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:15.960]  a tool that lets you measure your eyes because part of the trick about getting glasses
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:18.920]  you want to know exactly how far apart your pupils are. They have a little thing where
[1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:23.200]  you use a credit card. It's really clever because every credit card is sort of a standard
[1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:29.720]  width and you hold a credit card up to your face and they can measure your pupils. It's
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:34.000]  funny because I got that measurement. I did it with Warby and I, you know, long story short
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.560]  I've been to the eye doctor a lot in the last couple last year. The measurement I got
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:43.280]  from my eye doctor exactly the same as Warby Parker's seemingly gimmick like online
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:50.000]  thing. Really, really cool. Now, the best part though is they have this try on program.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.680]  Go to their website. You measure your eyes. You look at all of the glasses they have on
[1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:59.120]  their website in the catalog. You pick five pairs that you like. They send them to you
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:03.520]  risk-free. They just ship them to you with, you know, like clear, you know, non-prescription
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:07.880]  lenses. Like the ones you would try on in a store. You try these five on at home. You
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:12.440]  have five days. You just look around, see what other people think, see what the people
[1:18:12.440 --> 1:18:17.640]  in your family think. Pick the one you like best. You send them all back with the prepaid
[1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:22.120]  return label. It's super, couldn't be easier to send them back. But you send them back.
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.320]  You go to the website and say, here's the one that I actually liked. And next thing you
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:31.760]  know, a couple of days later, you get your eyeglasses in the mail. Could not be easier.
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:38.920]  Really, really easy way to get new glasses. They've also got prescription and non-prescription,
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:45.360]  sunglasses, anything you want that's eyeglasses related, Warby has it. And they even do
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:49.680]  this cool thing, where every time they sell a pair of eyeglasses to someone like you,
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:57.840]  a regular customer, they give a pair of prescription glasses to someone in need through
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:03.200]  various vision charities that are around the world. Which is a really great thing. If
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:07.920]  you think about that, imagine being so poor or living in a country where you can't even
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:13.440]  see sharply because you can't afford or can't get access to prescription glasses.
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:17.200]  All these charities help and Warby does like a one for one matching with them, which is
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:22.800]  really great. So here's where you go to find out more. Go to warbyparker.com slash
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:29.040]  the talk show. Warby Parker slash the talk show and check them out next time you need eyeglasses.
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:35.520]  My thanks to Warby Parker. Anything else you want to talk about this week? I have a couple
[1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:37.440]  of other things that are sort of maybes.
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:43.680]  No, I don't have anything more on my list. I mean, iPad Pro has been at the top of mind,
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:47.200]  I think for so many of us, the last couple of weeks.
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:55.600]  There's the issue that you touched on about this sort of, and I feel like everybody's been
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:59.600]  talking. This is like a perennial topic. But the whole idea of, is there a market for
[1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:06.320]  professional software for the iPad? And if so, why does it seem like it's worse than on the
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:12.320]  Mac that just to name a price that there's a lot of apps that sell for 2025 bucks on the Mac,
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:18.160]  and there are indie developers using that $20 to $25 per sale to build a healthy business,
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:29.280]  and on iOS, even on iPad, it seems like it's the, you know, $5 is considered expensive,
[1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:34.240]  and you sell an app for 10 bucks and nobody buys it, and it just doesn't seem like there's a market.
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:39.680]  I don't know. If you look at the size of the iPad market, I mean, there's this argument
[1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:48.000]  that, because the iPhone is so big, that people are building for iPhone and they're not
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:53.040]  worried about the iPad, but the iPad market is what? Bigger than the Mac market.
[1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:58.720]  That's definitely, because it's ever selling prices way less, and revenue is about the same.
[1:20:58.720 --> 1:20:59.200]  Right.
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:03.920]  So I'm not sure I buy, I mean, I buy the argument that the iPad Pro is not going to have such
[1:21:03.920 --> 1:21:09.280]  a huge user base that products just built for the iPad Pro are going to not be able to sell well.
[1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:14.080]  I will agree with that, but I'm not sure I buy it when it comes to the iPad in general,
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:20.640]  because the iPad Air 2 is very functional, and so is the iPad Mini 4, and, you know, there are
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:25.280]  issues with the Mac App Store. There's no doubt about it that Apple could do a better job
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:31.760]  of making, I mean, about the App Store in general, not the Mac App Store. There are lots of issues
[1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:36.160]  with the Mac App Store, but, you know, the idea that you can't do tryouts, and you can't
[1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:39.760]  pupate upgrades, and, you know, it's the same stuff we've been complaining about forever, but
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:46.480]  I'm not sure that I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm not sure I buy that it's not possible for
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:50.080]  software companies to make money building iPad software.
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:57.920]  I don't know, and I know none of these observations are original, but it does kind of ring some
[1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:04.800]  alarm bells for me that, just with the iPad Pro, like, what are some of the apps that people are
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:10.560]  talking about? Well, Adobe has the Adobe Sketch app, which is a really cool demo app for the pencil,
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:14.800]  and one of the reasons it's cool to demo is that Apple has been working with Adobe long, you know,
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:17.200]  more than just last week or two, they let Adobe in early.
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:22.560]  People are saying, I mentioned Microsoft Office, right? They were up on stage too.
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:29.360]  Yeah, yeah, and, like you said, you know, you can make an argument that the office apps are
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:35.280]  better on iPad than they are on Mac, but those two companies, A, they're huge, and B, they've both
[1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:41.680]  kind of switched to the subscription model, right, where you just pay Adobe for the Adobe cloud,
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:46.480]  and you have a subscription, and then you can use all of Adobe software. Well, that's fine for
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:55.280]  Adobe to borrow a phrase, but how many companies can get away with that? And I don't mean get
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:04.240]  away with it that they're cheating, but that they have a rich library of apps, and decades of trust
[1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:11.680]  with certain user bases that people will look at the price of that, and knowing, you know, go into
[1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:15.360]  it with their eyes open and know that it's going to renew, and they're going to pay this every year,
[1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:18.480]  and they'll say, well, that's worth it because I use Office all the time.
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:26.240]  Yeah, I, like I said, I think it's not easy, and I think that Adobe and Microsoft have this advantage
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:30.400]  and that they have a subscription relationship with their customers that means they have ongoing
[1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:35.840]  revenue from these things, and not everybody, you know, most companies can't offer that sort of
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:41.040]  thing. They don't have the ability, but, you know, I, again, I think there are plenty of things
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:47.360]  to criticize and ways that, ways that the market could be better, but, you know, there are professional
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:56.080]  level iOS apps that come out that people love, and that people are charged a decent amount of money
[1:23:56.080 --> 1:24:04.160]  for. And on top of that, I'm not sure this is any different than a lot of other difficult software
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:10.000]  environments to work in when I went to the release notes conference. I mean, what I heard loud and
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.160]  clear from a lot of the developers there is, you know, focus on niche markets. Don't build a,
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:19.040]  don't try to build a hit app, focus on these niche markets that, that, that, that once you're stuff,
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.760]  and that'll give them a reason to adopt iOS, or they're frustrated because they're using tools
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:30.000]  that aren't targeted at them. And, and then that's true on the Mac too, but you've got big players,
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:35.840]  and then you've got some players that build a better mouse trap so well that they grow a following,
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:40.480]  and then you've got apps that are not necessarily the most exciting, but they do the job for a
[1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:49.760]  particular area. And, um, I think, I think there's nothing in the iPad market that, uh,
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.960]  dissuades me from the belief that, that people can still have a success making professional software
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:25:01.120]  on the iPad. I think if it's just the iPad Pro, it's more problematic. It would be advantageous if
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:08.400]  that app also ran on the iPhone, of course. Um, but I don't know. I, I guess I'm just, I'm not saying
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:12.640]  that it's not hard and there aren't issues. I just, I don't think it's quite as extreme as all that,
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:17.200]  that, that there isn't a place for good professional apps to make money, but that's a,
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:20.480]  it's a very different game, right? The volumes are going to be a lot less, and the price is going
[1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:27.520]  to be a lot higher. And, you know, but I don't know. I just, I have a hard time saying it's going to
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:36.160]  be a barren wasteland, but I think it could be better. Yeah. And I just, I don't know. I, I feel like
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:43.440]  I want to say that the iPad Pro will help, but then I, I, then I try to say, well, how am I going to
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:49.680]  explain why I think that's so, and it's just, it more or less comes down to because it's really
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:55.360]  cool computer. Uh, and so I don't know that that's, I don't know what the path forward is. I can't
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:01.520]  explain it, but I, it, it, I think it needs to happen though, right? Like, but, you know,
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:05.920]  I have one example of it would be in, and it's the, that app we just mentioned earlier in a show,
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:11.040]  Fairight. Now there's, that's the exact type of app that I'm talking about, an app that somebody
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:19.360]  could use to do serious editing of a podcast using this device. So my hope is that those guys
[1:26:19.360 --> 1:26:26.320]  do just as well as they would if it was a Mac app and that people don't hesitate to make these
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:33.360]  $20 in app purchases to unlock the full app. I don't know that. Like, I, I just worry though that
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:39.200]  that, that the, that the consensus seems to be that people in, in large enough numbers won't do
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:46.560]  that for an iPad app. I think, um, some of it is, uh, about the fact that there are trials,
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:51.920]  although Fairight gets around that by making the app free and, and it's very limited. And I,
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:57.840]  I think you can even do that with the office apps that for a really basic use, you can just use
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:02.400]  them. You don't even need an office 365 account. And the, their point is that, you know, once you use
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:05.280]  them, you're going to want to connect to their services and do all these other things at which
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:10.080]  point you need an office 365 account. I, I think there are ways around it. But I, I get that it's
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:15.120]  scary and, and moving something like sketch from the Mac to the iPad, they've said they're not
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:20.320]  going to do it because they're afraid that, you know, for $100 that their app would be,
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:24.640]  nobody would, nobody would pay that side unseen. Um, I think there's some truth to that,
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:30.480]  although I think, again, people that there are ways, there are ways. But yeah, it's, it's,
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:36.720]  it's very easy to say, look, they should, they should radically change how they handle apps
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:41.920]  for the iPad and they should allow side loading or something like gatekeeper where on the Mac,
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:46.400]  you can download apps from third parties and depending on your security settings, you can just
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:54.400]  run them. And that is a breach in this, uh, semi impregnable wall of, uh, of the, the fortress of iOS
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:59.760]  in the app store. But, uh, and it would bring problems, but it would also bring some freedom and
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:05.040]  latitude that, that, uh, some of the professional, uh, professional software developers might like.
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:10.720]  I, I don't know. It's, it's complicated. And I think it's interesting to look at it through the
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:15.360]  lens of what we were doing just a little while ago about the keyboard thing, which is,
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:23.200]  is this, is the iPad being allowed to be its own thing? And do, if we, if we start with the iPad,
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:27.200]  do we come up with some different answers than we might for the iPhone? And does it need to be,
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:31.280]  you know, like, no, if it's this way on the iPad, it's always this way on the iPhone or
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:35.440]  does it become a little bit more like the Mac and the attitude toward things like software is a
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:39.520]  little bit different? I don't know. And I don't know if that would solve it. I don't know if
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:45.120]  opening up, uh, you know, the ability to download software from the internet, uh, rather than over
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:51.760]  the app store, it would be a cure all. It might help, but I'm not sure it, uh, it's enough.
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:57.280]  Yeah. And I wonder too how much of it is that independent developers, whether it's like a small,
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:05.040]  like two person, you know, true indie app making, you know, duo, you know, sort of like the
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:11.520]  top butts gang, which I know is a little bit more in two guys now. Um, or, you know, bigger,
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:15.920]  you know, true companies where there's, you know, maybe like 10 employees or something like that.
[1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:24.640]  But all the way up to a company as big as Apple, uh, itself that there's the whole mythical
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:30.640]  man month aspect to software development that you cannot just throw engineers at a problem. There's,
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:34.640]  there's, you know, at some point, there's too many, when there's too many chefs in the kitchen,
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.840]  you can't cook anything. It gets bogged down by the bureaucracy of managing the team. Um,
[1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:47.840]  and the world keeps moving and the industry moves and, you know, it's not all in isolation.
[1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:55.680]  And I just wonder how much of it is that by having wanting to keep your iPhone app up to date
[1:29:55.680 --> 1:30:01.680]  and moving forward and adding features and wanting to have maybe for some services like something
[1:30:01.680 --> 1:30:06.720]  like Slack where, you know, the big, their big screen interface sort of defaults to a web view.
[1:30:07.920 --> 1:30:13.920]  You know, even their native Mac app is a web view, whether it's a website or a Mac app,
[1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:19.520]  that by the time you do these things at the, at the ends, which would be like one end would be
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:23.200]  the smallest screen like the iPhone and the others would be the big screen like what are you
[1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.200]  going to do when you're sitting at your desk that the iPad gets lost in the middle. And maybe
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:32.000]  that's it's the exact same reason that some of these that we, we seem to bemoan a lack of
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:39.200]  professional strength apps for the iPad. And like we talked about an hour ago that just iOS
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:45.280]  itself that seems to have sort of like they just never seem to get around to making the iPad
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:51.680]  optimized. Yeah, I think I think there's a chicken and egg problem there a little bit.
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:57.680]  And then there's also this issue of getting lost in the shuffle that of course you prioritize
[1:30:57.680 --> 1:31:03.840]  the iPhone over the iPad. Right. If you do that, then you lose the iPad because it needs love too.
[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:08.080]  And you know, it's got to have some percentage of it if it's going to, if it's going to,
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:12.880]  kind of succeed, but it's the same platform as the iPhone. And so it's not as if you can
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:18.480]  send a team off to do the iPad on the side. It's all part of the, of the, of the larger hole.
[1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:24.800]  And, and it is, it is, yeah, the back to the chicken and egg problem that, that you almost
[1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:31.200]  need more people saying this is a place where I'm doing work for in order to create a place where
[1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:35.360]  developers want to be. But I think there will be some developer success stories. And I think,
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:40.080]  I think maybe in a strange way, the existence of the Microsoft and Adobe apps on there makes
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:45.760]  it a more welcome place because that gets you a long way between that and all the, the stock
[1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:51.840]  Apple stuff, you can go a long way with what's already on the iPad Pro. You, you can go a really
[1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:59.280]  long way. And that might make it easier for people to start using the iPad Pro and the iPad Air
[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:04.320]  to do even more of this stuff. And the more welcoming a place it is, then maybe the more welcoming
[1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:08.720]  a market it is for people building other, other software. But it's not going to be easy. There's
[1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:12.080]  no doubt about it. I'm just not sure whether there are a lot of things that can be done to make it,
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:20.000]  you know, easy. I think it's going to always be hard because business is hard. And it comes back
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  again to what we've been saying, which is what level of attention does Apple want to devote to this
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:30.320]  market and this product line because on one level, if you look at the numbers on their own, it is a
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:36.560]  very sizable business. And on another level, it is in the shadow of an enormous business. And I
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:40.960]  think that's the, you know, been to the detriment of the iPad all along the existence of the iPhone is
[1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:44.560]  as great as it is for Apple. It makes it just so easy to ignore the iPad.
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:52.160]  Right. And I wrote, I wrote about, I forget Brian, somebody, somebody's article, I wrote a piece
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:57.760]  on Daring Fireball, sort of taking a guy, taking an article apart for arguing that Apple is in
[1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:05.120]  trouble because the iPhone is so big. But I think that there, I do think that there, it's not that
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:10.480]  Apple is actually in a danger because the iPad or iPhone business is so big. But I do think that
[1:33:10.480 --> 1:33:18.000]  there, there are plenty of arguments to make that it's, it's not good overall that the iPhone is so
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.920]  big. But there's subtle arguments. And for example, one of them is that the iPad lacks attention.
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:31.040]  Yeah. Yeah. And it's not right. Exactly right. The danger of having such a wildly successful
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:35.120]  business, I wrote a piece about this like a year ago in six colors because I, and it was all just
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:41.360]  about the crushing math of the iPhone. Right. It's like, it's so big that it's very hard if you're a
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:48.320]  responsible manager at Apple, not to always choose the iPhone. Right. Because every little bit you do
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.680]  improves, you know, if you do a thing that improves the iPhone by 1%, you've made up,
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:58.400]  you'd have to improve the iPad sales by 40% or whatever. I don't know what ever the number is.
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:03.200]  But it would be, it's just an enormously different scale. And so you need the discipline to say,
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:09.840]  this business is also important. And it deserves a percentage of our time. But I can tell you as
[1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:15.920]  the guy who worked in Mac world that once we were part of PC world, which was larger than us,
[1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:22.320]  it became very difficult to get people to pay attention to us because we were a small
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:27.120]  fraction of the business. And if you, you know, it takes some discipline to say, I have two
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:33.120]  businesses that I run and I need them both to succeed. And it's very easy to say, well, where can
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:37.280]  I get the most return? It's the big business. So let's just invest in the big business and not
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:41.280]  worry about the small business. And sometimes I see that with the iPhone and the iPad.
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:49.360]  Yeah, it's, it's a much more nuanced argument to be had, but I do think it's, it's there. And
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:54.720]  it clearly sort of stands out. So switching gears a little bit, there's this article I have not
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.560]  written about it. And I didn't even read it until just before we recorded, but fast company had
[1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:10.720]  an article this week by Bruce Tognizini, aka Tog and Don Norman of the Norman, whatever group,
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:19.200]  what's it called? And it's a Norman group. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the Nielsen Norman group.
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:27.840]  Yeah. And this, this article broke my heart because I mean, were you a fan of Tog back in the day?
[1:35:27.840 --> 1:35:34.960]  Okay. Yeah, I guess I guess I guess I guess talk, right. Tog on design, and Tog was a guy who
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:41.520]  was at Apple like in the 80s and really kind of spearheaded the original human interface guidelines.
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:47.440]  And Tog on design, I don't know how I got my hands on it because it was sometimes it was hard
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:52.320]  to get those books back then. I don't know, but at some point like in high school, I got my hands
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:36:00.800]  on Tog on design. And I realized I was like, so it was, it was the sort of thing I loved thinking about,
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:06.480]  but it, it was like, this is what I want to do with my life. Like, I guess at the time,
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:12.960]  I thought more I wanted to design interfaces and do that. And instead, but I was right in a way,
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:17.520]  though, I just instead of really doing much design work, I just think about them and comment on them.
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:24.560]  But I knew that this was the field that I wanted to dig into. And what I remember in particular
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:34.320]  about Tog on design was he had this whole chapter about how they started with check boxes. And a check
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:43.840]  box was on or off, zero or one, and not very hard at all. And I think it even got into like,
[1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:47.360]  remember in the old Mac, it used to be filled in with an X instead of a check.
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:52.720]  Like a phantom. Oh, no, yeah, right. It was next inside the square. Yeah.
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:56.960]  Yeah, word. I mean, just talking, we were talking like system six, system seven like before they went
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:02.720]  to color. But then the other thing, but the, the, the, the, the meat of the chapter, though,
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:08.880]  was that they encountered, there were certain scenarios where something that clearly was
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:17.440]  asking for a check box could have an indeterminate state. And it wasn't on or off, but it was like
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:21.600]  halfway. And I can't think of an example of the top man, but he had a good example.
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:26.240]  It's the, I remember the role, the idea of a roll up where you've got a, you've got a couple boxes
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:31.280]  that are checked underneath. And the roll up is where you can toggle something on and off.
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:36.320]  And some of them are checked in some of them are not. So you can't say that the roll up is on or
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:42.560]  off. It's in this indeterminate. Right. Some, some on some off. Right. Here's an example. An example
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:51.280]  would be, let's say I select the name Jason and I hit command I and I italicize it in the middle
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.680]  of a sentence where the sentence wasn't italics. And then when I still have Jason selected or I
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:03.440]  select just the J and I go up to the menu where it shows me italics, the word italics in the menu
[1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:07.600]  would have a check next to it. Now that's not a check mark, a check box, but it still is a check.
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:13.360]  And it's the same problem. What do you do though when I select your name and the next word,
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:20.000]  where one of them is, so one word is italicized and one is not, what do you put next to the word
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:24.320]  italic and they were stumped by this? And then the solution they eventually came to and they
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:31.360]  still use is to use like a dash. So there's a check to say that it's on, but then there's a dash
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:40.000]  to show that it's sort of long. Yeah, it's complicated. That chapter and the fact that they
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.640]  some company that, you know, and I knew who Apple was at the time and I knew Apple was the
[1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:48.640]  computer company that I was most interested in, but the fact that they had, they had clearly
[1:38:48.640 --> 1:38:53.840]  spent as much time thinking about this problem as in my imagination. Apple spent on problems like
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.880]  this that you could just go off and have like a team of your top people spend like a week
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:02.720]  trying to figure out how to solve the problem of what do you use when a checkmark isn't quite
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.520]  right. I was like, this, this is what I want to do. Like, so I don't want to say he was a hero,
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:14.000]  but he was clearly somebody who like inspired me to get into this industry. This article,
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:21.920]  a fast company, it breaks my heart. It's so bad. You've, I told you to read it before the show.
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.080]  What did you think? Yep. Yeah, I think what I, my response was it's just as bad as I had
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:31.600]  feared from seeing it linked everywhere. Um, you know, there, there are a couple of things going on
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:36.320]  here. It's how Apple is giving design a bad, bad name. That's the, that's the actual
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:42.000]  headline of the article. Yeah. A lot of the way it's played. Uh, and I can't tell how much of
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:47.840]  this is the writers and how much of this is the editors. Um, they want this story to be how
[1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:54.080]  current Apple design is a failure. They want this to be about the, you know, the sort of last
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:40:00.080]  couple of years, functional high ground, skewer morphism debate kind of issues have left Apple
[1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:04.320]  in a place where it's kind of lost it. That's the story that they, that they want to tell
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.640]  and that, um, fast company design wants to tell, right? That's, that's, that's the story.
[1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.040]  The problem is, and this is, I saw, um, Richard Carris who used to work at Apple, he, he tweeted
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:19.920]  a link to this. And my response was, I love those guys, but you realize they've been complaining
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:26.560]  about Apple design for like 20 years now. And that's one of my problems with it is I think it's,
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:32.080]  well, I know it is disingenuous. I just not sure exactly who's being how disingenuous. It is
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:38.880]  disingenuous to suggest that this is a comment about anything Apple has done just in the last couple
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:44.000]  of years because these guys have been complaining. These guys have not been at Apple since
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.280]  basically at right when Steve Jobs came back. And they have been complaining about Apple's bad
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:55.440]  design for a very long time. They have been complaining about it. They complain about the iPhone design,
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:41:00.080]  you know, and I don't want to say that they don't have valid complaints. Some other complaints
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:06.000]  about usability are right. Um, there are some aspects where there's the old man yells at cloud
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:10.720]  kind of thing where they're like, it's, it's totally Apple's fault. But why is Google following them?
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:14.880]  And Microsoft is also doing things that aren't that great where it's like, oh, so everybody then,
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:19.040]  except you because you know how to do this and nobody else does. And you know, again,
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:24.320]  there's plenty to criticize here, but I'm not sure this is the article that that does the best
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.880]  job of it because it's not new for them to criticize Apple design. They've been doing it a very
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:34.640]  long time. I think a lot of the things that criticize are not recent. They're root issues about
[1:41:34.640 --> 1:41:38.640]  the touchscreen interface where they don't like it. And there's this little veneer that I have
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:43.680]  to say, I find kind of just tasteful where I feel like, you know, they're really mad that
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:48.080]  there aren't drop down menus. Yeah. And that there's not the discoverability because what they
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:53.760]  did with the drop down menus and stuff in the early Mac, that was ACEs. And now, you know,
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:59.600]  now these devices aren't discoverable like that. And they're right that they're not. But,
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:05.920]  you know, it's, we've come a long way since then and there are kind of different metaphors
[1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:10.480]  that work there. And you can dislike them all you like, but it's very difficult to play this as
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.680]  being like Apple isn't a design tale spin the last couple of years because if you really went
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:19.200]  back and looked at what these guys have been criticizing, they've been saying Apple's been in a
[1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:29.120]  design tale spin for like 15 years or 20. In theory, if you had told me a few years ago that Bruce
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:36.000]  Tognizini and Don Norman would write this article about Apple design in 2015, I might have
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:43.040]  thought a few years ago. Ooh, that might be really good. And the reason why, and I think at a
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:49.200]  fundamental level, they have a sort of, they approach design from what I would describe as a sort
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:59.200]  of academic background. And they use a sort of academic level of rigor. And they are both famously
[1:42:59.200 --> 1:43:06.320]  very, very strong proponents of user testing, where you get real people and you study them in a
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:15.600]  very formal way and with, you know, with a real procedural aspect to it and you study, you know,
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:21.280]  AB test all sorts of different things and measure response times and stuff like that.
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:30.160]  And Apple, you know, the modern Apple that they're comparing to, it's not quite, I wouldn't call it
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:37.680]  cowboy, but it is definitely not academic. It is a lot more of a liberal arts style approach to
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:42.560]  design. And that to me, there are differences and there's definitely some things, you know, I think
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:51.440]  you could, there's, on this general subject, a book could be written, a wonderful, thoughtful book
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:58.320]  that would, you know, be worth referring to for decades to come by talking about the differences
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:04.240]  between the old Apple that was more academic and its approach to user interface design and the new
[1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:12.320]  Apple, which is not. And this article is not it. This article is definitely more old man
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:20.480]  yells at the cloud. And it really just broke my heart. I remember, so I started at Mac user
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:24.960]  as an intern in the summer of 93. So it was like right when the Newton came out and it was,
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:31.120]  it was in the Scully era. And then I got to work there through the sort of darker, even darker
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:34.960]  times and they got darker still and then jobs came back. And these guys are both representatives
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:40.880]  of that kind of like first half of Apple's existence. And you're right, you know, I, I don't know
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:45.200]  how much you had, if any, interaction with Apple at that time, I was just a super junior editor.
[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:49.680]  So I didn't have a lot of it. But that Apple was so unlike the Apple that Steve Jobs
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:55.760]  fashioned when he came back because it was like super, they had pie in the sky R&D, they were super
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:01.680]  academic focused. And the, the problem was that they spent a whole lot of money and they had a hard
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:07.440]  time shipping products. And I, I'm not saying that these guys aren't brilliant and that they don't
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:16.960]  make some good points, but it was a different company than. And the, the results of when Steve
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:20.480]  Jobs came back and said, you know, we're not going to be like that anymore. We're going to be
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:26.000]  like this. They started to ship some really great products. Now, were they compromised in ways
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.920]  that perhaps some of the earlier Apple products weren't maybe, but those early Apple products were
[1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:37.520]  compromised in all sorts of other ways. So, you know, it, it's the academic Apple, I would say, as
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:42.560]  much as I appreciate it conceptually, I got to live through the, the latter days of it. And it
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:47.200]  was bad. I mean, it was like they did a bad job with products. And they might have been thinking
[1:45:47.200 --> 1:45:51.600]  about it really hard. But the, the actual company was falling apart and the products were bad.
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:56.720]  And I, you know, I, I, I know, Todd was long gone, I think by then. But, you know, I don't know,
[1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:00.560]  this, this article, yeah, there's some, there's some old man yells at cloud in here where it's
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:04.080]  like, why is nobody listening to us and why are all the touchscreen interfaces bad? And I don't
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:08.080]  agree that they're bad. There's some valid criticism in there. They have some very, they, they pick
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:15.680]  on some very specific things that are very, obviously problematic in the way Apple's products are
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.400]  designed. I think, and totally, totally valid. And then there's this third thing at work. And that's
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:24.720]  what I can't tell it, whether it's how much of it is fast company and how much of it is the
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:28.640]  writers, which is what's the news peg for this? How do we make this relevant? And the answer is
[1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:33.920]  to sort of play up that Apple has suddenly gotten to this point. And, you know, these aren't the,
[1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:39.520]  the guys who cried wolf. This is, this is an alert about what's going on at Apple right now.
[1:46:39.520 --> 1:46:42.560]  And the fact is, these are the guys who cried wolf. These guys have been complaining about Apple
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:47.440]  designed for years. Yeah. And there's aspects of it though of their criticism that to me are just
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:53.200]  wrong. Like they're complaining about that on like the iPhone and I guess iPad, but like on iOS,
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:47:02.560]  that the fonts are too, too thin to read. And I think that was true of the iOS 7 public beta,
[1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:07.360]  or I guess it wasn't a public beta, but like when iOS 7 was first shown two years ago at WWDC and
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:14.000]  they were using the really lightweight version of, yeah, weight of Helvetica Noya throughout the UI,
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.760]  including it was like the default font for the, the body of an email. I would totally agree.
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:24.720]  I think that that was too thin, but they changed that before it even shipped. Yeah, two years ago.
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:30.160]  The fonts are not too thin. And they're saying that the contrast is too low. Almost all the text
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:35.760]  I read on my phone is black text on a white background or even in like messages where you've got
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:43.680]  these colored backgrounds. I don't think it's a lack of contrast. And I think that the font size
[1:47:43.680 --> 1:47:52.000]  choice for system wide control of the font thing is really great in iOS. I think that they're
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.040]  totally, I think it's, I think that what they're saying as a problem is actually one of the things
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:03.520]  that iOS does great. I think, and especially with the switch to San Francisco, I think text has
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:08.960]  done nothing but get more readable on screen. And I still know somebody with less than perfect
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:13.760]  vision at this point. I think, I think, and some of what they're picking up on is some technical
[1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:18.800]  issues, which again makes it makes it feel a little more dated, which is some apps haven't really
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:25.200]  adopted the text size, the system wide text size format at like Google's apps. Last time I checked
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:32.880]  didn't do it, right? And so my mom was using the Gmail app and she was, she's got an iPhone 6 now,
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:37.920]  so it scaled up and it's bigger and she can read it better, but she wanted to scale up the font.
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:43.440]  And but she uses the Gmail app and it doesn't scale up. And that's a technical issue where
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:47.920]  app developers aren't adopting it, but the idea that you can set a system wide text size, if you
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:55.120]  want it bigger or smaller, is not a bad one. Slack doesn't do it. Which bothers me. Slack's default
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:48:59.920]  font size is actually beneath the threshold of what I can comfortably read and they don't follow
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:03.920]  the system wide setting. And I don't want to change my system wide setting for Slack because I
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:09.600]  like the default system wide setting for the system font. But I feel like if you're going to go
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:14.480]  with a custom font, which Slack has then you need custom font size. But anyway, I'd really doubt
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:20.480]  the Norman and Tog are talking about Slack. But my big problem with it with I think the premise
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:25.120]  of the article that Apple is destroying design is that in the end, it's so reductive, what they're
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:29.840]  basically saying is look, there are two ways to do design. And one is you start in the user and you
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.080]  think about how about usability and you build the design from it. And the other way is you just
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:37.840]  care about how it looks and you don't care about it. And Apple's doing that and we think you
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:42.000]  should do this. And it's like, I think it's really unfair that to say that Apple's doing that.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.400]  I think Apple, I think that the fact that Google and Microsoft are also doing it to a degree
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:51.040]  suggests that they're all struggling with how you do touch interfaces and create discoverability.
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.040]  I think, you know, I don't think Apple's like, as long as it looks pretty, the usability doesn't
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:58.480]  matter. I think it's a way more complicated story than that. I do think it's true that, you know,
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.160]  Johnny Ive has a huge amount of weight and he is a very visual designer. And so their perhaps
[1:50:04.160 --> 1:50:08.960]  is too much of an emphasis on that and a lot of the decisions Apple makes and that he might
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:14.240]  need a counterbalance of some sort that isn't there. But not to the extremes that this
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:18.240]  article seems to take it where it's the destruction of design and it's all about style over
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.360]  function. And I just, you know, I don't agree. They are you, they are you in favor of the
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:30.720]  Android system wide back button. Yeah, which, which if you've used it, I feel, I find, I haven't
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:34.480]  now, I haven't used it in a while. I do have a new Android phone here that I've been trying just
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:40.320]  to try to stay up on it. But my history with the Android back button was infuriating because you
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:44.960]  never knew where it would take you. The previous app, the previous function in this app,
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:50.000]  we're back to the home screen, right? The home screen back to the home screen. Oh, I thought I
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:56.320]  was going back to the village. It's really bad. And, and they don't mention that iOS has added,
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:02.640]  I think a very clever system wide feature in iOS 9, which is effectively gives you that it gives
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:07.680]  you that cross application back so that when you're in mail and you tap a link and you go to Safari
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:12.240]  and you just want to go back to where you were, which is a real problem. And iOS wasn't great at
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:19.600]  that. But now actually is really pretty good at because it, it, it both gives you like just tap here
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:24.720]  to go back to where you were, but way better than Android. It tells you where it's going to take you
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:30.960]  because it goes back to mail and the whole, it, the whole thing that drives you nuts to some beauty
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:35.280]  for discoverability, right, which is exactly what they say that Apple's not doing.
[1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:38.720]  Now, they do make some good ones. I think, and I feel like they could have written a whole
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:44.240]  article about, but it would have, you know, the old style would have been to also propose a solution,
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:52.000]  but they do point out that undo is better and on the Mac than on iOS because on the Mac,
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:57.520]  pretty much everything you can do, you can just go Command Z and a whole lot of things that you could
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:05.680]  might want to undo, you can undo. And iOS undo is, is literally like a joke, like they didn't know
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:11.440]  what to do. They knew they didn't have it. And an engineer at Apple, like as a joke said, well,
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.160]  we could just make it so that you shake the phone and undo it. And Scott Forstahl was like,
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:22.000]  great, that's it. Do it. That's it. And they're like, no, no, that's not really it. And he's like,
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:27.280]  no, let's do it. Like, actually in tech, in tech starting with iOS 8, the undo is better because the
[1:52:28.640 --> 1:52:34.320]  smart bar or whatever they call it, the quick bar has an undo icon on it. So if you're in text,
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:38.640]  you can at least undo it. And there are undo buttons in other places, but it's not it's not system wide
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:43.680]  unless you're using a keyboard in which case you can usually Command Z now and undo. But yeah,
[1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:48.160]  the bumping the phone thing was always there's nothing worse than you're out in the world and you
[1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:52.800]  see somebody like shaking their phone like a tambourine and it's because they need to try and get that
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:58.560]  thing back that they just undid by mistake. So it's it's interesting. It is there's an interesting
[1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:04.960]  argument to made there that, you know, given the idea that basic gist of the iOS interface,
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:10.400]  how do you implement undo? It's a it's a heck of a puzzle and Apple clearly hasn't solved it yet.
[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:15.120]  And I don't know what the answer is. But on the other hand, I really don't think that it's a real
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:22.880]  world problem that's set iOS back. Like what I see in the real world, and again, I just feel like
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:30.160]  they these guys have missed it is I see real people who are doing more stuff with either the iPhone
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:35.760]  or even if it's like Android, which is clearly follows the iPhone's fundamental idea of what
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:41.440]  the design is like that they're they're doing more than they ever did on their old computers
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:47.440]  because they're it's it it actually is a better design for for most people.
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:51.280]  Right. Because of the amount of complexity that's been packed into that screen, it's actually
[1:53:51.280 --> 1:53:55.360]  kind of a harder challenge and people feel really comfortable using their phones.
[1:53:55.360 --> 1:54:03.360]  Yeah. I have one last sponsor to thank and it's our good friends at Harries. You guys know
[1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:11.760]  Harries. Harries makes a high quality shaving and personal grooming products. They just sent
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:18.640]  me. I just got a new thing. They have a facial wash. So now I've got a fancy fancy facial wash
[1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:23.360]  that can take with me in the shower of great products like that. You guys have heard of them before
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.840]  they've sponsored the show many times. But what they want me to tell you about right now and
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:34.240]  remind you while it's while it's still fresh is that they are the official partner of the
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:40.480]  mowvember foundation. And they are donating money and helping to raise awareness for men's
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:47.120]  health. Mowvember is the thing where you what you do is you grow a mustache for the month of
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:52.720]  November. And then when people ask you, hey, you grow a mustache, then you tell them I'm doing it
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:58.880]  for a mowvember. It's a thing where we raise awareness for men's health issues. It's like a gimmick.
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:03.360]  You could do it while you're writing your national writing national novel writing month thing.
[1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:09.360]  Right. So I'm a thing. Yeah, grow a mustache right a novel. Well, Harries is a big partner in this.
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:15.920]  They do all sorts of good stuff and they're raising money for this. And the top it off, the fact
[1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:21.040]  that they're they're raising money for a great cause. They make great products. And it's super
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:27.520]  super convenient where you can just get into the get into the Harries products. And then you just
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:31.840]  you never have to go buy shaving stuff again. You just sign up for it. You get you find out how
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:38.160]  frequently you need new blades. And they just ship them to you. Really high quality stuff. Great
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:42.960]  blades. They own their own factory over in Germany. Great handle. Great. They're they're shaving
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:48.400]  creams and lotions and stuff. Everything I've ever tried from them. I really like amazing packaging.
[1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:56.240]  Really cool stuff. And the website is super easy to use. My dad, it was not really that good
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:01.840]  with computers. My dad saw that they are always sponsoring my stuff. He needs to shave. He signed up for
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.400]  it. He actually navigated the website and bought it and he called me to tell me how proud he was of it.
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:12.960]  Super super easy. They say you can get started in 30 seconds or less. I believe it. It's that easy.
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:17.920]  You just sort of go there, pick what you want, enter your name, your credit card, your address.
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:21.600]  Most of that stuff for most of you probably auto fills. And then boom, next thing you know, two
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:27.120]  days, two, three days later, you got a nice little Harries kit in the mail. Also makes a great
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:31.280]  gift. So if you want to get somebody else in your family, a little starter kit from Harries
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:39.840]  for the holidays, now's the time to order. Here's the thing. You can go to Harries.com and enter
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:47.120]  the code talk show. These guys don't have the the, it's just talk show. And they will give you five
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:53.600]  bucks off your first order. So you could get started with that code talk show. You could get the
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:59.120]  starter kit for just 10 bucks. That's a razor, a couple of blades, some shaving cream, great deal.
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:06.080]  So my thanks to Harries go to Harries.com slash talk show. You've got the, the membership thing
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:11.760]  going at six colors. That was, that was what I was going to mention. So yeah, yeah, I did it. I
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:17.360]  spent like a year fussing and about whether I wanted to do it and the implementation actually took
[1:57:17.360 --> 1:57:22.480]  like an hour. So after a year of saying, do I want to do this? Do I want to do this? I,
[1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:27.280]  I did it in an hour. So how did you, how does that work? How did you, because I, it's funny,
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:33.840]  I did memberships for Daring Fireball a long time ago. Yeah, I got the card. And it, you know,
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:38.880]  I really the only thing anybody ever got out of it was a card. And I kind of moved away from it.
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:45.920]  And it's it, well, not kind of, I totally moved away from it. But I, I spent an awful lot of time
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:51.360]  implementing it. And I didn't have any features. It was, I think it's just me stubbornly trying
[1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:57.040]  to build everything for Daring Fireball myself. So what are the mechanics behind it at
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:04.640]  six colors? So yeah, so I mean, technically, fortunately, that there is a company that has
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:11.920]  integration with Stripe, which does credit card processing called memberful and Ben Thompson uses
[1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:18.240]  them for statutory Federico uses them for Mac stories. And I had been looking at them since
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:23.920]  sort of mid year for, for six colors. And they're very easy to work with. You pay them a monthly
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:27.840]  fee and they take a percentage of the credit card transaction, which includes the percentage
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:34.560]  that's going to Stripe. And, um, and they, uh, and you drop some, they've got a WordPress integration.
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:38.080]  But of course, like you, I'm using movable type, which has no integration. But there's a
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:43.040]  JavaScript integration where you put some JavaScript in the header of the page. And it basically
[1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:48.080]  takes all the links to memberful, uh, and turns them into little popups. And I actually got an
[1:58:48.080 --> 1:58:52.640]  email from somebody who said that it was the easiest, uh, e-commerce thing they'd ever seen
[1:58:52.640 --> 1:58:56.720]  because they never left the page. You, you know, you click and a little box comes up, the
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:59:02.000]  Stripe box comes up. And on the back end, memberful does all the membership. What they provide
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.680]  is, uh, the sign up stuff and they keep track of the members and you can cancel and renew
[1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:11.920]  and update your information and all of that using their servers. And then they have integrations
[1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:17.200]  with other things. So there's a, uh, the benefit. I mean, the primary reason for it is to say,
[1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:22.240]  you know, you want to support me in what I'm doing. And the more people who do that, the less
[1:59:22.240 --> 1:59:26.080]  freelance work I'll take, there's some freelance work I really like to do for various reasons.
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:30.320]  But there's a lot of it that I, in the first year of being, uh, uh, an independent person,
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:34.800]  I've said yes to because it's very hard to turn down money when you're starting out and you
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:39.920]  don't have a salary anymore. And some of those, yeses, I would like to turn into nos and instead
[1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:45.040]  spend that time writing more on six colors. But, uh, so that, that's, that's the premise. Um,
[1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:51.120]  but I also didn't want it to be a purely kind of karmic subscription where I didn't want to go out
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:54.960]  and say, hey, give me money because you'll feel good and you'll help me. I wanted to at least give
[1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:59.520]  something back because I felt like it was important that there'd be something tangible as a part of it.
[1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:04.400]  So, uh, although I did think about the, the membership cards, like, like the one I've got for
[2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:10.080]  daring fireball, um, what I decided was to do, I wanted to do a newsletter. Um, and I was thinking
[2:00:10.080 --> 2:00:15.040]  about frequency and do we want it to be weekly. Uh, sometimes that's a bit much for people. Uh,
[2:00:15.040 --> 2:00:19.920]  do I want it to be, uh, you know, every other week? And I decided for the start, at least,
[2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:24.320]  I wanted to be monthly and I'll try to make it a little more substantial. And at that point,
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:28.320]  I'm doing a monthly release. I might as well call it like the six college magazine. And that's
[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:32.480]  mostly because, you know, I used to work in a magazine, Dan Morin, who writes some stuff for the site,
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:37.760]  you know, he works, he worked at a magazine too. Um, it's not going to be like a super fancy,
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:42.880]  uh, magazine magazine. It's going to be a monthly, you know, a bunch of words and some pictures
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:46.800]  in a newsletter. But that's what we're going to do monthly for the subscribers and maybe throw in
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:51.920]  some extra stuff. So there'll be something that only people who pay can get. But the goal is not
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:56.320]  to like gate content on the site or anything like that. The site, the goal is actually to use the,
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:01.440]  the money from the people who are subscribers to generate a lot more stuff on the site for
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:06.400]  everybody to see. So it's a combination of karma and getting something in return. Right. And if
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:10.720]  there's a certain, you know, however, you, you're a fast typist, but there's still a limit to how
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:15.120]  many words are going to come out of your fingertips in a month. And to get more of those,
[2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:19.200]  more of that writing on six colors, dot net and less of it spread or spread about the,
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:26.240]  you know, dot coms places. Um, six, you can spell it with, you could spell it colors with a you
[2:01:26.240 --> 2:01:30.160]  though, but it is a dot, it is a dot com. I was really hung up on getting a dot com for this one.
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:35.280]  But, uh, but yeah, that's, that is, I think I would say that's the number one feature of the
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:40.720]  six seller subscription is not the newsletter, the six colors magazine. It's that, uh, the more
[2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:46.080]  people subscribe, the more I can do. And honestly, also the more I can pay Dan Moore and to do
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:51.360]  and the more stuff we will do on the site instead of taking an assignment for something that,
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:56.160]  you know, that is not going to be on the site. It might be on a site with, you know, a bunch of
[2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:00.320]  ads on it that you don't want to see or on a subject that you don't really care about. Um, we,
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:03.760]  you know, we'd like to be able to do less of that in more of six colors because, you know, it's
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:09.360]  like more of what you want to see. Yeah. And I find, and I'm, I'm sure that you feel the same way,
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:14.560]  but it's, when I went full-time with Darren Farbell, it wasn't just about getting the revenue
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:22.640]  up to the level where I could call it a salary. It, it, it mattered to me that it was coming from
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:28.560]  multiple sources. Like I wanted it to be a stool with three or four legs. And sure, maybe one of
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:36.320]  the legs would get bigger over time. Like I get more money from say the weekly RSS sponsorships than
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:42.800]  the deck or whatever. But that, and maybe five years from now that would change though, and maybe
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.640]  if, you know, the demand for the RSS sponsorships waned, maybe the deck would get more popular
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:56.000]  or whatever. But I've just felt much better when I had four or five things that were all contributing
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.360]  to, wow, that's, I can call that I can actually say I do this full-time than if it was all coming
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:06.240]  from one source because that just made me very nervous because what happened, you know,
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:12.720]  as we've seen, the industry changes and things that used to be popular don't aren't popular
[2:03:12.720 --> 2:03:19.680]  forever. And direct support from users is the one that I feel like if it, if it works, boy,
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:23.840]  that's one that should, should stay consistent as long as I keep doing good work.
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:30.000]  Right. And diversifying is, is definitely a part of it. I did hear from a bunch of people when
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:33.440]  I launched the site who said, I want to support you and I'm not going to sponsor your website
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:36.800]  because I have nothing to sponsor. And right now that's the only, that seems to be the only way
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:40.560]  that you're being supported. Basically, saying you're ad supported, why don't you also be
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.640]  reader supported? And that, that was definitely a motivator to make this happen is it wasn't just
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:49.680]  my scheme like, oh, they will pay me money. Ha ha, it was people saying, I will, I will pay you
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:54.640]  money. Let me pay you money for what you do. And so that was part of the plan. But you're right,
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:59.840]  it's also about diversity. I saw that during the, during the, the recession that, you know,
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.520]  at IDG, the, you know, a company that is largely run by salespeople that there is that moment
[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:10.080]  when the sales go off the cliff where suddenly the fact that you've got these hundreds of thousands
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  of paying subscribers became a much greater asset than they had ever appreciated because those
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:20.800]  people were still there. And they were still paying, even though all of your clients that you
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:25.760]  used to sell ads to have, have vanished because they're afraid of the recession. And I, that,
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:30.560]  that lesson stuck with me that being, being diversified is not a bad thing. And when I left
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.640]  Macworld, that was always part of my plan was to have like, um, uh, some money coming in. So the
[2:04:34.640 --> 2:04:39.200]  incomparable has sponsorships. So there's some money coming in from that. And I wanted to do tech
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:44.560]  podcasting. So I, I do a couple things at relay and there's money coming in from that. And,
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:48.560]  and six colors, I figured, okay, if I can do a weekly sponsor, like you do one during fireball,
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:52.720]  that there would be some money coming in from that. And then that was my plan was sort of like the
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:57.760]  three pronged attack. And in reality, um, I picked up some freelance writing work, which I hadn't
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:04.320]  planned. Um, and, uh, and then there was this thing kind of floating out there about the, the reader
[2:05:04.320 --> 2:05:09.360]  support. So that, that makes it that much more diverse. And also, let's me, gives me the freedom,
[2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:13.920]  like I said, of making some decisions of saying no, because the first year in I felt like it was
[2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:18.320]  very hard for me to say no to anything because it's like, you know, you don't have a job. And these
[2:05:18.320 --> 2:05:22.000]  people will pay you money to write an article and you could write that article. So why don't you go
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:25.200]  ahead and write that article? And at some point, you need to be able to say, I did this with you
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:28.640]  with Macworld, right? Where I finally, one of these days I came to you when I said you want to write
[2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:34.480]  a back page column and you're like, yeah, I don't need to do that anymore. Yeah. But it was a huge
[2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:40.000]  deal to me when it happened though. I mean, and it was, it did come about at a time when I was,
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:45.760]  you know, daring fireball. I mean, it was, it, it, it's a lot more successful now than it used to
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:50.160]  be, but it was never, there was never any point where it was like, wow, all of a sudden it's,
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:05:54.800]  it's successful. It's just been like a slow steady increase. And, you know, 10 years ago,
[2:05:54.800 --> 2:06:00.640]  you know, getting to write a back page column from Macworld, you know, maybe once a year or so,
[2:06:00.640 --> 2:06:07.120]  actually was like, it, yeah, like we need that money. I remember very clearly, you wrote a,
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:12.800]  how to article for me about BB at it. And you were doing daring fireball at the time, but you wrote
[2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:18.560]  this article was like a two page, three page, how to article. And I remember later you said to me,
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:22.240]  I think I might have made more money from that article than I made from daring fireball.
[2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:27.600]  That was really, really early on. And the freelance rates at Macworld were really good back.
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:32.560]  Yeah. But still, I mean, that was, that was in the early days. And then, you know, and then
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:37.040]  over time, you made more money from daring fireball. And there comes that point where you say,
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:42.320]  you know, what, I need to say no to things. And I need to focus on the thing I want to do that,
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:46.640]  and I have the ability to do that now because of the money that it's bringing in. And ultimately,
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:55.040]  I said this in my, in my post about the six colors membership is ultimately what I would love to do
[2:06:55.040 --> 2:07:02.720]  is do six colors and some podcasts as my job. That would be like the perfect thing. And I'm not,
[2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:06.240]  I'm not at that point yet, but I would love, I would love to be able to get there. And the,
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:11.680]  the membership thing helps me, helps me move toward that. Yeah. So how's the reaction been so far?
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:19.120]  It's been good. I had a little number in my head of, of how many people I hoped would be done,
[2:07:19.120 --> 2:07:23.760]  you know, would sign up after the first sort of week. And it's within like,
[2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:29.120]  it got within about 15 of that after the first week, which I was really happy about because
[2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:34.080]  I thought that was just the beginning. And I, you know, I haven't even mentioned it very many
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:39.680]  places other than on Twitter and on the site. So, you know, there's more people who will hear
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:43.600]  about it over time. And so I hope that that number will grow. So I, I'm pretty happy with that
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:48.560]  initial like week one number. I think that's, I think it's a, that's pretty good. I'm surprised the
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:53.680]  percentage of people who choose the annual and just pay for a year upfront is, is much larger than
[2:07:53.680 --> 2:07:58.480]  I thought it's about three quarters. Yeah. And that's beautiful because that's people who say,
[2:07:58.480 --> 2:08:03.280]  look, I'm not going to try it out for a month. I'm in, I'm in for the year. I think that,
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:06.800]  I think that's really great. So well, it's been going pretty well. And memberful has made it really
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:11.040]  easy. So that's, they're not paying me to say this. In fact, I'm paying them. But that, that's made
[2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:16.800]  it a lot easier too to not have to deal with a lot of the stuff that I was afraid of about dealing
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:22.400]  with, a dealing with money. And I've only heard from two people who said what I expected, which was
[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:27.440]  I pay, you know, I paid $60 a year for Mac world, or $50 a year for Mac world. Why am I paying
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:32.560]  $60 a year for six colors? And the answer is, well, you're doing this to support me number one.
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:37.200]  And number two, Mac world was able to have hundreds of thousands of people pay them. And I'm
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:42.080]  not going to have, if, tell you what, if I have a hundred, hundreds of thousands of people paying me
[2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:50.880]  for a six color subscription, I'll cut the price. I guess I, I never, I only got two of those though,
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:55.120]  so it's okay. My reaction is to laugh. And then I want to stop laughing because I want to say,
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:09:01.440]  I never want to tell other people what to do with their money. And I agree. It's a very personal
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:06.320]  thing. And, and if that's really how you feel, okay, but you know, I do feel like there's a
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:12.400]  teaching moment there about the scale of something like six colors are daring for a ball.
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:16.960]  And I reply to both of those people. I reply to both of those people. And I had somebody telling
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:21.040]  you, you shouldn't don't reply to those people saying, no, I think it's a teachable moment to say,
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:26.720]  look, you know, this is mostly about supporting me. It's, you know, I, I'm not supported,
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:31.520]  ad supported at the level of, of something like a Mac world. But, um, you know, a hundred percent
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:36.080]  of it is going into, you know, we don't have a lot of corporate over, over structure here. And,
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:40.640]  you know, you should do it because you want more stuff on this site that you like. And if that
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:44.160]  makes you feel good and you want to get some benefits out of it too, then you should do it.
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.360]  And if you don't want to do it, that's fine. The site's still free. I'm not making you feel bad
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:54.320]  about it. I'm not trying to guilt people into giving me money. Please continue to read the site.
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:59.600]  The RSS feed is free. The website is free. Keep reading the site, right? And both people responded
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:04.560]  quite positively. And one of them actually said, I'll pay. So, you know, that's not bad,
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:09.680]  batting 500 there. It makes a lot of sense. It makes me, warms my heart, it makes me feel good about
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:16.640]  the state of humanity. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Well, I, I, I knew you were talking about it. And I,
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:23.680]  you know, I'm the master of having ideas to do things like with the site or to start a new site or
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:29.040]  something. And then, you know, years go by. And yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Yeah. So, I knew
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:33.200]  you were thinking about this from a while ago when you first struck out on your own. But I,
[2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:38.320]  I think hitting it right on like right around the one year anniversary was it somehow felt right.
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:45.200]  Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I'm glad that it, uh, in the end, it's a bonus feature that I got a little more
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:52.000]  of a track record to do it, even though I was just hopelessly, um, you know, procrastinating. And it's
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:57.200]  hard, it's hard to ask for money from people. It really is. And you don't know whether they're going
[2:10:57.200 --> 2:11:01.200]  to, uh, you know, they're judging you at that point. So that makes it a little harder. And I got
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:07.600]  better over the first year at asking sponsors for money. But, uh, at asking the audience asking
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:13.120]  the readers for money is just, this is why I'm not an ad sales. And so it, I think ultimately
[2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:18.160]  that's why it took me a year to actually do it is that I just, every time I thought about it,
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.320]  I don't like, oh man, I don't really want to do that. And I would just put it off. So, you know,
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:28.080]  finally, I got kind of spurred into it and, uh, and given a deadline and, uh, by some friends,
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:32.240]  and I was like, all right, okay, I got to, I got to make it happen in November. So let's do it.
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:37.040]  So I did it. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you did. And anybody out there who's thinking about it,
[2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:42.160]  go check out, uh, colors.com and you can see how to become a subscriber yourself.
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:50.080]  Um, Jason, I thank you for your time. It was a good episode. Uh, anything else you want to
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:54.480]  promote or mention some of these other podcasts you're on. You're on, I'm counting right here.
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:05.600]  I was going to make, uh, 40. It's too many. I'm not sure I can count that eye.
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:11.600]  I'm on four, four weekly podcasts. And then others that kind of come and go with the wind.
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:17.840]  But upgrade and, and clockwise on relay and, uh, and the incomparable, those are the, those are the
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:24.400]  big three. Um, yeah. And, uh, and you know that new Star Wars movies coming out, maybe, uh,
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:28.800]  maybe I need to talk to you about that sometime. I might be a good thing to do. You know,
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:31.840]  or is that going to be the holidays, but you know, this, you know, the scenes like it would be
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:36.240]  hours. Like now the idea, the idea that we did a holiday spectacular last year where, you know,
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:41.360]  in that nether zone where there's no news happening around the holidays, we just talked about Star
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:46.320]  Wars. And now we're going to have a new Star Wars movie. But I wonder, is, is it, is it fair to do it
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:50.160]  right when it's new and assume that everybody's gone to see it in theaters? I almost feel like with
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:53.920]  this one, it is fair. Like, come on, who's not going to go see this in theaters?
[2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:04.800]  I think so. Yeah. Well, if it's that nether week, that's going to be like a week and a half after
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:08.320]  it came out two weeks after it came out, that's plenty of time for the people who care,
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.080]  and the people who don't care should just not listen, or they could listen and they don't care.
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:16.560]  Either way, right? I doubt there were going to people, be people who want to listen to many
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:21.120]  hours and the other Star Wars is yet have not seen Star Wars movies. I guess some two weeks later,
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:24.720]  it seems like that's a really small cause. I was going to say it's, it's pretty easy to avoid
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:28.800]  spoilers on a podcast because even if you're using a podcast player that plays the auto
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:33.280]  plays the next episode, once you realize that we're talking about Star Wars, it's pretty easy to
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:38.720]  pause it and wait until you go see it. So that's file it under probably that we will talk about
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:43.760]  the Force Awakens. Yeah. I thought you were going to do a yoda there.
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:14:13.600]  All right, I will not spot a podcast or not.
