[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  Renee Ritchie, Tom Gruber, for my more. How long was your iOS 8 review?
[00:04.400 --> 00:15.520]  21,000 words. What? Holy shit. Yeah, 200 pictures. I need to be put down. 21,000 words.
[00:15.520 --> 00:21.920]  You know, and I mean this sincerely, and that's just because not just because you're the guest on
[00:21.920 --> 00:29.360]  the show, but for years, I've been thinking, man, wouldn't it be great if somebody wrote iOS
[00:29.360 --> 00:36.240]  reviews each year, the way John Syracuse does Mac OS X reviews. And I realized that you do.
[00:36.240 --> 00:42.240]  Like they're all there. They're there all the way back to iOS 2. And you know, it was just
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.680]  called like iPhone OS 2 or something like that. And they are book length. 21,000 words.
[00:49.680 --> 00:55.200]  Seriously, that's more closer to a book than an article. I just, I always feel this need to explain
[00:55.200 --> 00:59.840]  things as if, you know, because Apple gives us WWDC sessions and they give us canos, but the canos
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.880]  are fast. And the WWDC sessions are super geeky. And I just picture my mom or my dad,
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.080]  really wanting to find out what's going on and kind of write that for them.
[01:09.280 --> 01:16.800]  That's true. I don't know. It's, you know, it, it, it, Apple's, these OS updates are getting,
[01:16.800 --> 01:23.680]  well, they've always been deep, but like iOS 7 to iOS 8, there is so much. And from a marketing
[01:23.680 --> 01:29.600]  perspective, Apple really just can't cover it in detail. They can't publish 21,000 words about it,
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.760]  you know, and it's, it's like they're moving so effectively year over year that it's, it is,
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.600]  I think it's truly a challenge to keep up. I take the Syracuse thing as a huge compliment.
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.240]  I can't say that I anywhere nearly as competent as he is to write these things.
[01:48.240 --> 01:54.160]  But I think that's exactly exactly it. They are so, especially something like extensibility
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.560]  and how it works and the container apps and the host apps and how the security and privacy
[01:58.560 --> 02:04.480]  is handled are really complicated topics. And I, I watch those sessions four or five times each
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.960]  because I want to understand them better. And the writing process is sort of me digesting and figuring
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.080]  out what it all means. Yeah, I, I almost mean it the other way. I do mean it as a compliment.
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.120]  I mean it as a profound compliment, but I almost worry that the way that I pose it that I say,
[02:19.120 --> 02:23.760]  hey, it took me years to realize this that we already had somebody doing it and it's you.
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.080]  I almost worry that that comes across as an insult because I say it took me years to realize it.
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.200]  And I think, and I don't mean it as an insult in any way, but I do think that maybe the reason
[02:33.200 --> 02:42.400]  it didn't dawn on me right away is that your style is so much more understated. It is a very,
[02:42.400 --> 02:50.480]  you know, you personally are almost out of the picture. And it's a, I know that this word in terms
[02:50.480 --> 02:58.960]  of journalism is grossly overused, but it's a much more objective viewpoint. And with Cirqueusa,
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.720]  he's always there, right? It is, it's, it's Mac OS X reviews very specifically
[03:04.720 --> 03:12.640]  from his perspective and, and as it pertains to his obsessions.
[03:12.640 --> 03:18.400]  Well, he's got an amazing, a, a thorial voice. You can, he talks the way that he writes and you just,
[03:18.400 --> 03:25.440]  you always know it's exactly John. And I, I have my biases. I try to state my biases upfront on them,
[03:26.240 --> 03:31.920]  but I think there's just so much to cover that I have to get out of my own way when I do it.
[03:31.920 --> 03:36.480]  Yeah, I totally agree. So a lot of writing, it puts it's good because this way I can have
[03:36.480 --> 03:40.240]  someone on the show who wrote more than I did this week. Yeah, although it's especially the watch
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.600]  piece and the iPhone review, those are amazing. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Thank you. It was both. And I,
[03:45.600 --> 03:52.000]  you know, I really did but write them both in one waking day from like around one in the afternoon
[03:52.000 --> 03:59.680]  until 6 a.m. Just one after another. I had, I had notes all over the place from, you know,
[03:59.680 --> 04:03.200]  the eight days prior. I mean, it's certainly like I didn't, I didn't start writing in a vacuum,
[04:03.200 --> 04:08.960]  but I just all I had were notes and wrote them both. And I think they were both like a little
[04:08.960 --> 04:16.080]  over 4,000 words. So like 8,000 words in one working day, which is needless to say unusual.
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.240]  Well, I like the watch one especially because we've had people who cover smartwatches,
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.800]  write about them. And we've had people like from HÃ¶dke who do cover watches, write about them.
[04:24.800 --> 04:29.040]  But you made a really salient point in your piece that that these two cultures are going to
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.760]  clash in the middle. And you poke some fun. My friend Phil Dickinson yesterday and rightly so
[04:33.760 --> 04:39.040]  because he was saying that, you know, the $70 watch band was a hefty price. And people have no
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.760]  idea what's coming when these two industries merge, I think. You see, I put a, I posted a clarification
[04:43.760 --> 04:52.000]  yesterday and the point because I think it was, I think it was misinterpreted where I'm not
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.480]  cheerleading or clapping or, or smugly sitting with my arms folded about the idea of multi
[04:58.480 --> 05:03.760]  thousand dollar Apple watches. I'm just saying, I think that that's what's coming, whether you
[05:03.760 --> 05:06.800]  like it or not, whether you have a strong opinion on it or not, whether you think that's cool,
[05:06.800 --> 05:13.120]  whether you think it's ridiculous or preposterous. But I do think, and again, like something like
[05:13.120 --> 05:18.880]  a band that costs $500. If you think that's hefty, I would, I would agree. That's, you know,
[05:18.880 --> 05:25.040]  I don't think, no matter what your income of three, four, $500 band, just the band is, you know,
[05:25.040 --> 05:32.240]  hefty, hefty is a decent word for that. And, you know, like I, in my research for the watch piece,
[05:32.240 --> 05:37.280]  I was looking at things like what does it cost to get like an actual Rolex stainless steel,
[05:37.280 --> 05:43.600]  not no precious metals, but stainless steel replacement band. And they sell for at least $2,500
[05:43.600 --> 05:49.120]  because I think the ones you can find online are sort of gray market because you know,
[05:49.120 --> 05:53.440]  authorized dealers for Rolex and other brands like that don't advertise prices. But let's just say
[05:53.440 --> 06:02.160]  that's in the ballpark. If you want to think that that's exorbitant, I'd see exactly what you mean.
[06:02.160 --> 06:07.840]  I may not necessarily agree, but I can totally see the reason of somebody, like I could say,
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.720]  that's a reasonable position to take that nobody should buy a watch that the band alone costs $2,500.
[06:12.720 --> 06:18.800]  Totally reasonable. I don't necessarily agree, but it's reasonable. But $80, $80 is right there
[06:18.800 --> 06:24.400]  smack in the middle of the mainstream watch market. That's absolutely true. I have another friend,
[06:24.400 --> 06:29.600]  Kevin, and he collects watches. He has six or seven years ago, Omega's in panorise and Rolex's
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.080]  and other brands whose names escape me. But when he first heard about the Apple watch, he loves
[06:34.080 --> 06:38.240]  technology. And he said, though, he was not going to buy one unless they had one that was in the
[06:38.240 --> 06:42.720]  thousands of dollars because it wasn't the kind of watch that he was interested in. And now,
[06:42.720 --> 06:46.960]  when he read your piece specifically, he said that it made him even more inclined to buy it.
[06:46.960 --> 06:51.360]  And frankly, the more expensive they get, the more appealing that is to him as someone who loves
[06:51.360 --> 06:58.480]  watches. Well, anyway, we're only a couple minutes in, but it's impossible for us in one show.
[06:58.480 --> 07:04.320]  Even by the ever-growing length of episodes of this show, there's no way that we can talk about
[07:04.320 --> 07:10.160]  everything. And I think the watch is unfortunately going to be the cutting floor because
[07:10.160 --> 07:18.640]  the phones are new. I've had them for a week. iOS 8 is out and is new and you have covered it.
[07:19.280 --> 07:24.640]  I think it's fair to say more extensively than anybody else. Maybe Federico would only be the
[07:24.640 --> 07:30.160]  only other person I could think of who's who's depth of coverage of iOS 8 is in the same ballpark.
[07:31.200 --> 07:35.920]  And I think we'll be lucky to finish on time, even with just those two things.
[07:35.920 --> 07:41.840]  And we could talk about the event itself, which I didn't really cover and I usually like to do.
[07:43.680 --> 07:50.560]  And maybe that's where we can start. Got a bunch of sponsors to run through though. So,
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.880]  let me, you know, let's take a break before we even get started talking about the event.
[07:55.600 --> 08:00.720]  And let me tell you guys about our first sponsor. It's our good friends at Harry's.
[08:00.720 --> 08:06.640]  This is one of those sponsors. They've been with the show for a while now. They keep doing it.
[08:06.640 --> 08:12.080]  If you haven't tried these guys yet, you're nuts. So, what is Harry's do? Harry's is a company
[08:12.080 --> 08:19.600]  that looked at the men's shaving market, every aspect of it from the hardware, the blades and
[08:19.600 --> 08:28.720]  erasers and shaving cream and stuff like that. You know, the hardware, the products, just looked
[08:28.720 --> 08:33.120]  at the whole thing and said, this market is ripe for disruption. You're not getting, you're paying
[08:33.120 --> 08:40.080]  too much and getting an inferior product. I was on electric shadow today and Moises described,
[08:40.640 --> 08:44.480]  you know, the stuff you get from Gillette is looking like a, I forget what he said, something like
[08:44.480 --> 08:50.400]  a cross between a disco and a hot wheels car. Just bad industrial design and cheap.
[08:50.400 --> 08:56.000]  Harry's stuff, their, their razors, their handles are so nice. They just look like something that's
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.880]  built to last quality wise and built to last design wise. Just in terms of like you could buy one
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.120]  in 10 or 15 years from now, it's still going to look nice. It's just right. It doesn't look like
[09:07.120 --> 09:14.000]  it's from this decade or that decade, just quality design. And they're disrupting the pricing
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.960]  because they're giving you higher quality stuff at lower prices. The starter sets an amazing
[09:20.960 --> 09:26.480]  deal for 15 bucks. You get a razor, moisturizing shave cream and three razor blades.
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.760]  Why pay 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades when it's half the price at Harries?
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.040]  And the big thing too, I think it's important, is that they're not just slapping a name,
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.640]  you know, and they do have a cool name, cool brand name, ship stuff and cool boxes, but they're
[09:40.640 --> 09:46.080]  not just slapping their name Harries on blades made by others. They're so serious about controlling
[09:46.080 --> 09:51.280]  the whole thing, the whole widget is that they purchase their own razor blade factory in Germany
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.320]  and they're producing their own high quality, high performing, German razor blades.
[09:58.160 --> 10:04.960]  It's just great. It's great stuff. I can't say enough good things about about their product.
[10:04.960 --> 10:13.200]  So where do you go to find out more? Go to Harries.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com, and enter the coupon code,

[10:19.760 --> 10:24.800]  whatever your first order is. And like I said, their starter kit is, it's just 15 bucks. So,
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.280]  I mean, you can, you know, it's practically like getting started for free. So check out Harries.com
[10:29.280 --> 10:36.080]  and I guarantee you're going to be happy with it. All right, so the event in the Flint Center,
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.480]  big mystery white box out front for a while. You were there. I think you were sitting two seats
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.240]  down for me, right? Where's, or were you next to me now? I think I'm speaking to you and Jim.
[10:47.120 --> 10:56.400]  Right, me, you Clayton Morris and Jim Dowrymple. Now, getting invited to these sort of events,
[10:56.400 --> 11:01.040]  now that's how many times have you been to like a keynote with a press badge? Why is this my second?
[11:01.760 --> 11:09.120]  And the first one was WWDC. So that, you know, it's, you know, I hesitate to say new Apple,
[11:09.120 --> 11:14.800]  but it is an evolved Apple, I would say new implies like a change in direction. I would say
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.080]  it's more of an expansion of a direction they were already in. Yeah, I know. I think that's absolutely
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.760]  fair. It's, it's sort of like some of the constraints have fallen away from them. Yeah, and there,
[11:25.760 --> 11:32.240]  you know, openness is indeed the right word. Now, I compare this all the way back to the original iPhone
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.560]  2007. The original iPhone 2007 review units were only given to, I think four people, I think it was
[11:38.560 --> 11:46.560]  Ed Begg USA Today, Pogue at the Times, Mossberg, then at the journal and Stephen Levy at Newsweek.
[11:47.040 --> 11:52.240]  That was it. They were the only four people on the entire planet who got a review unit of the,
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.680]  the original iPhone. And I would say even for a few years after that, the, the people who were
[11:59.680 --> 12:05.360]  on the list of, you'll get pre, you know, a review unit a week or two weeks before it actually comes
[12:05.360 --> 12:14.000]  out was limited to established, long established print periodicals, even if most people nowadays,
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.040]  even those days were reading them online. And then slowly they started adding people from online
[12:21.040 --> 12:29.760]  only publications, you know, the ingadgets and people like me and, and, and, uh, Dower & Bull and stuff like that.
[12:29.760 --> 12:37.040]  Yeah, and on, uh, and it's, you know, so that's why I say and, and clearly what they've done is
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.080]  they have greatly expanded the list of members of the press who are getting invited to these
[12:42.080 --> 12:47.600]  events. It's no longer, I still say, I think it's still selective. I can't even imagine how many
[12:47.600 --> 12:52.240]  requests they get that they turned down. But I think it's opened up in a way, and I think in a
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.560]  right way where it's people who should have been, I think it's, you know, long overdue that you've
[12:56.560 --> 13:06.880]  been, you've gotten invited to stuff like this. Daniel Dilger from Apple Insider has, I think maybe,
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.320]  I don't know if WWDC was the first, but it's, you know, certainly within the last year that he's
[13:10.320 --> 13:17.040]  starting to get a little bit too. Yep, serenity. Well, serenity in Macworld's gotten invitations for
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.040]  a long time. Yeah. But they, they, it's, I'm never sure with Apple whether it's the publication or
[13:21.040 --> 13:27.920]  the journalist that they're inviting. Uh, it's both is my feeling. I don't think, I think it's sort
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.520]  of the equivalent of asking whether Apple is a hardware software company, you know, it, it's
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.560]  both because like for example, M. G. Seagler, uh, when he was full time at tech crunch was getting
[13:40.560 --> 13:47.200]  invited. And then when he left tech crunch, but before he joined Google, he still got invited
[13:47.200 --> 13:52.160]  even when he was in the full time person. Right. And he left in gadget. Yeah, he's a,
[13:52.160 --> 14:01.680]  another good example. Yeah, perfect example. Um, I, it's clearly though, and I can't help. We
[14:01.680 --> 14:05.840]  talk, a bunch of us, because we had like an hour to burn before the event milling about, I mean,
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.880]  which is, you know, when, and that's what we do, we sit there and insider gossip, but it's,
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.960]  it's almost impossible not to draw a conclusion that it has something, you know, that this
[14:14.960 --> 14:20.240]  expansion of the list and less exclusivity has something to do with Katie Cotton's departure.
[14:20.240 --> 14:25.120]  Well, it was also a much bigger venue than they've used for iPhone events in the past and often,
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.760]  you know, at least, you know, they would cite capacity issues, but they made sure they had room for
[14:29.760 --> 14:35.600]  2,000 odd people, including fashion bloggers, and you introduced me to the gentleman from
[14:35.600 --> 14:41.760]  Haudick, the watch bloggers were there too. Right. Yeah, you know, I didn't know Ben climber
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.840]  personally, but I'll even though I've, I've been a fan of the site for a very long time. Um,
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.920]  but I actually thought about introducing myself to him in advance, just sending an email,
[14:51.920 --> 14:55.200]  I don't, you know, I don't even know if I could assume that he's, you know, familiar with
[14:55.200 --> 15:00.160]  retiring fireball, but maybe, but even if not, I would, you know, take the point that just saying what I do.
[15:00.160 --> 15:03.840]  And just saying, hey, did you get an invitation to this event? Because I thought that would have been,
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.440]  you know, a sure fire tell that they were going to do a watch. I can't help but think too,
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.280]  the fact that guy, and maybe he couldn't say, maybe he got an invitation that said he can't talk
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.800]  about it, but I think the fact that, that Ben climber was there and presumably other people from
[15:18.800 --> 15:26.400]  the watch world, uh, is why the fact that they were going to do a watch leaked within about the last
[15:26.400 --> 15:33.360]  week. Sure. Um, because even just a month prior, when I suggested that maybe they would do the
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.840]  wearable at the September event, even though all the previous rumors said it would be an October
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.120]  thing. Uh, and it was like a big deal for a day that I'd said that. Um, everybody was expecting
[15:43.120 --> 15:46.880]  October, right? And then all of a sudden about a week before it was like, oh, yeah, they're definitely
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.720]  going to do a watch. And I can't help but think it's because they started inviting people.
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.560]  Yeah. Well, I mean, that that joke comment that you made was, uh, terrific. I mean, that that
[15:56.560 --> 16:02.720]  propagated incredibly quickly across the internet. Yeah. Well, it really was though, wasn't just
[16:02.720 --> 16:08.480]  that anybody told it to me. It was honestly just the hunch that it would make sense as a single
[16:08.480 --> 16:13.040]  event, you know, here's this thing where you can do touch ID on your phone. Here's this thing,
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.920]  you know, to pay, um, because I knew the payment thing was coming and it just seemed like, well,
[16:17.920 --> 16:21.760]  why not do it with the watch and same thing with all the health tracking? Sure. Whereas I don't
[16:21.760 --> 16:27.040]  see how the watch would fit with an iPad and Yosemite event in October. Yeah. If it's going to be
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.200]  a companion product specifically for the iPhone, then it makes sense to do it in the iPhone event.
[16:32.480 --> 16:36.640]  Yeah. And that's the other thing too. I did see that that I didn't know, you know, nobody knew in
[16:36.640 --> 16:42.960]  advance that it was going to be a, hey, you need, you need an iPhone to fully use the Apple watch. Um,
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.760]  all right, you know, they've said to use it period, uh, even though a lot of its functionality
[16:47.760 --> 16:54.480]  is not dependent on having being with them proximity to the phone, but, um, yeah, that makes sense too.
[16:55.120 --> 16:59.200]  And it's not surprising. No, and it was, it was a really strange morning because you and I,
[16:59.200 --> 17:02.880]  and I think we were standing with Jason Snell on a couple other people and we noticed that
[17:02.880 --> 17:08.320]  Apple was quasi live blogging their own event, which I've never seen before. Yeah. That's totally
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.720]  new. You know, and I, you know, I've always thought that like you said with the capacity that
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.800]  they cite, you know, well, we have it here because we can't find a bigger place. Um, I don't recall.
[17:18.800 --> 17:22.960]  And, and Jason Snell, we were talking about this in Snell, it seems to think that they might
[17:22.960 --> 17:28.560]  have done this at some point, but I can't recall them ever using Moscone West other than as a
[17:28.560 --> 17:35.280]  keynote from Macworld Expo or WWDC when, when, you know, uh, Moscone has already been
[17:36.320 --> 17:41.840]  rented out, um, that they've never, and I think, you know, and he said he thinks maybe they have,
[17:41.840 --> 17:46.960]  but it's hard because if somebody else, like in last week, for example, Intel had a developer's
[17:46.960 --> 17:51.200]  conference at Moscone West, so they couldn't have had the, they literally could not have done it,
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.920]  but I don't think they've ever done that. And that's a huge room potentially. Other than that,
[17:55.920 --> 18:00.080]  they, I've, in all the years, I've been going to these things. I've never seen one that was in
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.480]  an event, uh, a venue as large as the Flint side. And it's historic for Apple too, because they've
[18:04.480 --> 18:10.080]  been a point of pointing out this is where the Mac and the iMac are introduced. Right. Um,
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.440]  the biggest surprise to me and the sign that Apple PR has, you know, truly evolved and changed
[18:17.440 --> 18:24.400]  whether it was, um, that Brian Lam was invited. Yeah. Now at the great, great wire cutter site,
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.600]  uh, and I think it's great that he did. But the reason that's remarkable is that he's the guy who
[18:29.600 --> 18:36.960]  was running Gizmodo back when they had their hands on the stolen iPhone from the, the bar where the
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.400]  Apple engineer had left it. And he's the guy who answered the phone when Steve Jobs personally called
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.120]  and said, give me back my phone and said, no, you know, we want something from you before we
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.960]  give it back to you. The fact that he's now off the shit list and on the invitation list is
[18:52.960 --> 18:58.480]  remarkable. I, even with all of the expansion of it, even with the return of Gizmodo, because
[18:58.480 --> 19:02.960]  everybody who was there back then has gone from Gizmodo now, they've, you know, the gocker sites
[19:02.960 --> 19:09.440]  go through, you know, employees, you know, like, uh, butter churning. Yeah, even if you believe
[19:09.440 --> 19:14.240]  the penalty boxes expired on Gizmodo, you never quite sure if the ban on that specific player has
[19:14.240 --> 19:18.560]  been lifted. Exactly. Um, you know, and I think it's right. I think, you know, forgive him,
[19:18.560 --> 19:22.640]  forget, you know, Brian Lam is doing very different work and much better work these days.
[19:22.640 --> 19:27.520]  And why not? But I just know where I cannot believe that, that would have happened if Katie
[19:27.520 --> 19:32.160]  was still there. Oh, again, it feels sort of like a huge constraint that had been on them
[19:32.160 --> 19:35.360]  has been lifted. And they can do a lot of the things that they probably thought would have been
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.840]  cool and fun a long time ago. Like the countdown timer on apple dot com. Yeah, totally. Yeah,
[19:39.840 --> 19:44.480]  and the live block. Yes. Yeah. I have suspected an end would pull out a computer and start
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.200]  live logging it right from the floor with us. Did you see him? No, he, he wasn't there apparently.
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.680]  Oh, I didn't know that. I looked around for him, but it was so many people that I, I'm surprised
[19:53.680 --> 19:59.600]  I found as many people friends that I knew before the event as I did. It was so crazy. I took a
[19:59.600 --> 20:04.880]  panoramic picture and a couple people comment and I've tweeted it and a couple people said it looks
[20:04.880 --> 20:10.640]  like, uh, like one of the Disney World theme parks in the morning before they opened the gates,
[20:10.640 --> 20:14.640]  you know, and when thousands of people show up to try to beat, you know, get on the rides first.
[20:14.640 --> 20:20.240]  Uh, I mean, it really did. It's some people were saying, and Apple's a little cagey, I think
[20:20.240 --> 20:25.440]  about stuff like this is like how many people actually were there. I don't think they, they don't
[20:25.440 --> 20:29.520]  like to answer stuff like that. But somebody said that they had a capacity twice that of your
[20:29.520 --> 20:34.000]  bubuina. I don't see how that's possible though. It has to be more than twice, I think, because
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.080]  I've been to your bubuina events many times and I've never seen half that many people there. I've,
[20:40.080 --> 20:44.480]  you know, it seems like a third or even fewer. Someone mentioned it sees between 2000 and
[20:44.480 --> 20:49.760]  2400 and I saw later some people that I know some friends were there and they tweeted that they
[20:49.760 --> 20:53.840]  were there and I did not see them at all throughout the entire course of the event. There's so many
[20:53.840 --> 20:59.760]  people. Um, the other thing that I thought too is there were a lot more Apple people there too,
[20:59.760 --> 21:05.600]  even with this expansion in the list of press who were there to cover it, which is definitely true.
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.840]  They invited way more Apple people to be there. Like when at the end when Tim Cook said,
[21:09.840 --> 21:14.960]  hey, everybody who's from Apple, please do me a favor stand up right now. Um, see my half the crowds
[21:14.960 --> 21:18.240]  stood up. Yeah, apparently they had an internal lottery in some of the departments because they
[21:18.240 --> 21:21.680]  couldn't get everybody. So you'd, you'd get a chance to go and a bunch of people got picked,
[21:21.680 --> 21:26.960]  which is really nice to see. So, you know, after, you know, it's almost a week and a half now as
[21:26.960 --> 21:32.640]  we record this, um, looking back on how do you, what are your thoughts on the event as a whole?
[21:32.640 --> 21:36.960]  I think the event, I have sort of two trains of thought about it. One is that I think
[21:36.960 --> 21:41.680]  the stuff itself was really, really interesting. The stuff they showed off the iPhones,
[21:41.680 --> 21:46.480]  uh, it was similar to when they finally went from AT&T to Verizon. They finally went from a four
[21:46.480 --> 21:50.480]  inch to larger iPhones. And you can argue whether they should have done that earlier. I think
[21:50.480 --> 21:55.920]  they had really good timing, but also it wasn't quite like the iPad or the iPhone event.
[21:55.920 --> 22:00.080]  And I think specifically the iPad event because Steve Jobs was so careful to say,
[22:00.080 --> 22:05.200]  this is your phone. This is your laptop. This is the tablet. And this is what it does better
[22:05.200 --> 22:09.280]  than both those things. And this is the reason it has to exist. And with the iPhone,
[22:09.280 --> 22:12.560]  it was, you know, these are the old keyboards. And this is why they're wrong and the old
[22:12.560 --> 22:18.880]  input methods and technologies and why they're wrong. And for the phones and the, uh, watch,
[22:18.880 --> 22:24.240]  we got a list of really amazing features, but there was never that one moment where, uh,
[22:24.240 --> 22:29.040]  Tim Cook or anybody at Apple said, this is, this is the, the reason this has to exist.
[22:29.760 --> 22:33.680]  For the iPhone 6. Yeah, or the iPhone 6 or the, I watch. I mean, I think it was clear,
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.240]  like we can extrapolate it. Like the, I, the, I watch is clearly convenience and the iPhone 6 is
[22:38.240 --> 22:43.040]  clearly a higher class of, of software eventually, but it was never stated outright on a single
[22:43.040 --> 22:48.080]  slide or in a single sort of slogan. I think for two very different reasons though. I think with
[22:48.080 --> 22:56.320]  the iPhones, it's, uh, they're not hard for anybody who's used an iPhone to get their heads around.
[22:56.320 --> 23:04.000]  The screen is either bigger or way bigger. And the camera's better and they get better battery
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.760]  life and their thinner and sleeker. And right, you could pretty much stop right there. Uh,
[23:09.760 --> 23:16.000]  uh, you know, it's, it's, you know, I don't think I wasted any words in my review,
[23:16.000 --> 23:22.560]  but I think that a very short overview, um, can get across 85% of what most people would want
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.280]  to know about these phones, right? The iPhone 6 is bigger. It gets a little bit better battery
[23:27.280 --> 23:32.800]  life. The screen has, is nicely improved, you know, in terms of, uh, viewing angles and color and
[23:32.800 --> 23:38.400]  stuff like that. And the camera's better. And that's it, you know, and you can, you can get it
[23:38.400 --> 23:45.040]  in higher storage capacities. And then the iPhone 6 plus, uh, it's way bigger. If you want like a
[23:45.040 --> 23:50.960]  new style device that's, that's like a two-handed iPhone size more like a mini tablet. And you're
[23:50.960 --> 23:55.120]  going to get a couple more hours of battery life per day because the battery is so humongous.
[23:55.760 --> 24:01.120]  Um, there's the, you know, there's a new class iPhone for you and stop right there. And I think
[24:01.120 --> 24:05.920]  that covers what it, what it means for 85% of the people. Yeah, I agree completely. I think my
[24:05.920 --> 24:10.880]  only reservation is that you're never sure, uh, like we, we all live in bubbles of various sizes.
[24:10.880 --> 24:17.280]  And I have, uh, Nexus 5 and I have a Lumia 1020 and I have, um, I've used galaxy notes and
[24:17.280 --> 24:21.360]  galaxy megas and, and things like that, the big phone. So I'm, I'm a little bit familiar with them.
[24:21.360 --> 24:26.000]  But I think a lot of people have only bought iPhones are only familiar with the 3.5 and 4-inch
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.160]  size. And to hear why Apple didn't continue that like why they, they went to the bigger screen.
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.560]  I mean, I think, you know, there's, there's a productivity argument to be made for the iPhone
[24:36.560 --> 24:42.320]  6 plus. But even the iPhone 6, there's a, there's a, a really brief statement about,
[24:42.320 --> 24:45.840]  we're going to give you more. We're going to give you a bigger window, window into the internet and
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.760]  into apps. It would have just eased a little bit of the stress that people had when,
[24:49.760 --> 24:52.640]  oh, my, you know, instead of saying, oh, my God, the abandoned the 4-inch would be,
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.080]  oh, wow, this is so much more that I can do now with 4.7. Yeah. And I've been thinking about that,
[24:58.080 --> 25:04.000]  you know, maybe even close to a year ever since it became so strongly rumored that they were
[25:04.000 --> 25:13.200]  going to go to two sizes, 4.7 and 5.5 and not have a next generation model at the 4-inch side
[25:13.200 --> 25:19.840]  size. I've been thinking for a long time, you know, the whole, the whole year, well, I like 4.0 inches
[25:19.840 --> 25:29.200]  and 4.0 inches is the size of the most, best selling, the best selling most profitable
[25:29.200 --> 25:35.680]  phone in the world because that's what the iPhone 5s was, you know, and the iPhone 5C was like,
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.320]  I don't know, like third, like the third best selling and most profitable smart phone in the world,
[25:40.320 --> 25:48.240]  like three, two out of the top three selling phones in the world were 4.0 inches last year,
[25:48.240 --> 25:52.560]  and they've, now they've just let, and you know, one I asked about this, and one of the things I
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.920]  was told was, well, we haven't left it behind, we still have those phones. They were just
[25:55.920 --> 26:02.720]  moved down the line and including the fact that you can buy the new 5s at 32 gigabytes,
[26:02.720 --> 26:10.000]  not just at 16 for $49 more, it's $149 on contract. And that's not entirely new either,
[26:10.000 --> 26:17.840]  because the 5C, when it was, as a brand new device last year, came in 16 and 32 gigabyte sizes too,
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.120]  but I feel like that's a little bit more of a, it just seems to me like a little bit more of a hedge
[26:24.160 --> 26:27.680]  now. Yeah, it's an escape patch if you're not quite ready to grow with Apple to the largest
[26:27.680 --> 26:32.720]  screen sizes yet. Right. So I don't know, I wonder if they're going to wait and look at what people
[26:32.720 --> 26:39.360]  buy and what, how things go or what they're thinking, like it wouldn't totally, I would expect
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.360]  that next year we're just going to get S, I don't know if they'll use an S, but equivalent iPhone
[26:45.360 --> 26:54.320]  6S and iPhone 6S plus and the two new phones will be these sizes. I don't expect there to be,
[26:54.320 --> 27:00.000]  you know, them to go back to 4.0 inches. It sounds to me like they've said, here's the, at this
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.040]  point with the technology, where technologies evolved, where prices have evolved on screens,
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.600]  what's the best sweet spot to hit the most people with the least amount of choice,
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.440]  these are the two sizes they've decided on. I think, but I wouldn't be shocked if they,
[27:15.440 --> 27:23.760]  you know, have a 4.0, you know, call it the iPhone 6 mini, you know, and it's this rounded form
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.560]  factor, but at a four inch size. It wouldn't shock me, but I don't expect it. No, and I think it's
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.440]  interesting and you had a good post before the event on what you thought the screen sizes would
[27:35.440 --> 27:40.400]  be and why. And it reminded me of the first time I read it of when Steve Jobs was talking about
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.000]  the difference between the iPad and Android tablets when they were just basically expanding the
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.400]  interface. And he was saying that with the iPad and the split view controller allowed a higher
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.240]  class of software. And when I saw the five, sorry, the iPhone 6 Plus turned sideways and you get
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.960]  that split view controller, it reminded me of the same thing. These bigger sizes, the Apple's only
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.200]  doing it with the iPhone 6 Plus, but developers can do it with any size that they want now with
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.880]  the new adaptive UI that it will allow for a higher class of software, but that sort of necessitates
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.480]  a larger screen, especially for anybody who doesn't have really good, really young eyes.
[28:15.280 --> 28:22.400]  Yeah. Well, I don't think there's no way that that split view would work on the 4.0 in size.
[28:22.400 --> 28:28.480]  They show it in that WWDC session in a demo app and it does look, but is that that 16.9 aspect
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.760]  ratio that is wasteful in some interfaces on the iPhone in landscape mode and the split screen just
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.520]  seems to fix that one problem. Yeah, especially with the keyboard up because there's a minimum
[28:39.520 --> 28:45.040]  height to a usable keyboard. And on the 4.0 in size when you're when you're horizontal, it's
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.200]  at least half the screen. Whereas on the two new phones, it's not, you know, it leaves a lot more room
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.920]  above it because they don't, that the keyboard isn't the same relative size. It's more like the same
[28:55.920 --> 29:01.360]  physical height. Yeah. And it is that compromise that I think, you know, you spoke about earlier
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.880]  where it is bigger to carry around, but the iPhone 6 Plus specifically, you turn it around and get
[29:06.880 --> 29:12.800]  that iPad style layout, you are gaining productivity out of that compromise. Yeah, I'm looking at the
[29:12.800 --> 29:19.440]  6 Plus in my hands right now. And with the keyboard up in landscape mode, horizontal mode,
[29:19.440 --> 29:26.480]  it's a little bit more than a third, but it's way less than a half. There's way more usable screen
[29:26.480 --> 29:32.400]  real estate above the keyboard on this. Yeah, the iPhone 5 and 5S may be really claustrophobic with
[29:32.400 --> 29:37.600]  the keyboard up in landscape mode. Yeah, I, you know, and that might be the main reason why I say
[29:37.600 --> 29:43.360]  I never use my iPhone and landscape other than what things where, you know, like videos or watching
[29:43.360 --> 29:50.320]  videos or playing games, likewise. The only thing I ever, ever do in landscape is sometimes with a
[29:50.320 --> 29:55.760]  web page that doesn't really, even with double tap to zoom the text is too small, I'll turn it
[29:55.760 --> 30:02.000]  sideways to be able to read it. And that's it. I can't think of anything else that I do in landscape.
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.560]  No, I'm exactly the same way, which is why that at 16.9 aspect ratio is so good for those
[30:08.560 --> 30:13.600]  few specific things, but the other portrait is much better for the rest. Yeah, and I think it
[30:13.600 --> 30:18.720]  shows, for example, in Vesper, like Vesper doesn't support landscape, because I think Dave and Brent
[30:18.720 --> 30:24.960]  feel the same way. And I think that's come to bite us on the ass now because on these bigger
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.600]  phones, it really feels weird that an app doesn't support landscape. And maybe it's just because
[30:29.600 --> 30:33.760]  as I was reviewing the phones over the past week, I was doing it a lot just for the sake of
[30:33.760 --> 30:39.920]  seeing what it's like. But it no longer feels silly or some kind of concession to people with
[30:39.920 --> 30:46.640]  particularly big thumbs or something like that. It feels like it's a first class part of the iPhone
[30:46.640 --> 30:50.640]  interface. Yeah, well, big hint to that, I think, you know, the original iPhone didn't even let
[30:50.640 --> 30:54.960]  let almost nothing go into landscape. What I think Safari did in the video app almost nothing,
[30:54.960 --> 30:59.120]  but now even the home screen does on the iPhone 6 Plus. I think that's a big hint for people.
[30:59.120 --> 31:04.080]  Yeah, I like, and that's that's kind of neat too. I like it. And I like the way that the the
[31:04.080 --> 31:08.480]  dock is always on the right. Yeah, as somebody who on the Mac is always always worn his dock on
[31:08.480 --> 31:13.280]  the right. It feels very natural. The iPad moves it around with you, but it feels very natural on
[31:13.280 --> 31:17.520]  where's your dock on your Mac? My dock on my Mac is on the left-hand side, but it hit me
[31:17.520 --> 31:25.520]  so the time left. I know. I'm going to get a new guest. I'll fix it. Now you're off your off the show
[31:25.520 --> 31:31.440]  left-hand dock. Oh, it's gross. Now I don't know. I have always been a right-hand dock person and
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.600]  I'm glad that's where they put it on that phone. Actually, I have it on one of my Macs to sit the
[31:35.600 --> 31:40.320]  bottom and one of it is on the left. Yeah, bottom is acceptable, although I still think it's weird.
[31:40.320 --> 31:44.240]  The left is just because I forget which one it is, but one of them has that really wide screen,
[31:44.240 --> 31:48.400]  and it just seemed to I want more vertical pixels. So I got it off the bottom and I just stuck it on
[31:48.400 --> 31:53.840]  the left. My problem with talk on the bottom has always been that all every Mac screen is
[31:53.840 --> 32:00.080]  horizontal, and so vertical real estate is always at more of a premium than horizontal real estate,
[32:00.080 --> 32:08.400]  so why not put it on this side? But anyway, that's neither here or there. Anyway, to the event,
[32:08.400 --> 32:14.560]  I think if they needed to, if the watch, let's say that come August 1st when they really needed to
[32:14.560 --> 32:19.760]  say, okay, what are we going to do next month? And if they had said, you know what, the watch
[32:19.760 --> 32:25.760]  just isn't ready. Even for a pre announcement, it's not, you know, we got to scrap it. They could have
[32:25.760 --> 32:33.280]  had an event similar to previous iPhone events, and then, you know, include Apple Pay, just the
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.720]  iPhones and Apple Pay, and it would have been fine. Yeah, it would have been a smaller venue.
[32:38.720 --> 32:44.240]  I don't think they would have taken the Flint Center. And I think Shiller could have easily gone
[32:44.240 --> 32:49.120]  60 minutes instead of 30 minutes talking about features on the phones and what's improved.
[32:49.120 --> 32:53.440]  Yeah, because he would Craig recapitulate WWDC has done several years in a row.
[32:54.080 --> 32:59.520]  Yeah, I don't think so, though, because I think that's waiting. I think we will see that in October,
[32:59.520 --> 33:04.560]  but I feel like that would have been harder to do because at WWDC, they can talk about,
[33:04.560 --> 33:10.800]  you know, look, all this stuff is all beta, right? The handoff and all the other,
[33:13.600 --> 33:16.080]  what's it called? The catchall phrase for all.
[33:16.080 --> 33:18.800]  Not extensibility. Not extensibility, the search of the sea.
[33:18.800 --> 33:24.400]  Continue continuity. Continuity. All these continuity features. I don't think that they could do it in
[33:24.400 --> 33:29.040]  a September event where iOS is no longer beta, but Yosemite is. Yeah, very true.
[33:29.040 --> 33:33.680]  I think it had, I think that the Federiki stuff, you know, demoing all the continuity stuff
[33:33.680 --> 33:37.680]  has got to wait for October. I think it could have just been, you know, Shiller doing stuff on the
[33:37.680 --> 33:43.840]  phone like he has in past years, and maybe, you know, add Tim Cook's usual preamble with the sort
[33:43.840 --> 33:50.240]  of state of the company, could have had a 90 minute event with, you know, maybe 50 minutes of
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.440]  iPhone six and, you know, the rest of it Apple pay and would have been fine.
[33:55.440 --> 33:58.720]  That's very true because in previous years, Cook would, he'd go over all the results,
[33:58.720 --> 34:03.040]  he'd make fun of Android a little bit. He'd do each of an Apple store opening with a nice video.
[34:03.040 --> 34:06.560]  And this year, he said, and, you know, I think it's worth pointing out, you know,
[34:06.560 --> 34:09.360]  Apple's doing fine and then they got right into the iPhone.
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.080]  Yeah. And Shiller, I mean, he was flying, I thought. I mean, I thought it, you know,
[34:14.080 --> 34:18.400]  I don't, it wouldn't say he was rushed and he was polished, but that was a really, really
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.360]  concise. I mean, I think it measured it almost exactly 30 minutes, and that's really short.
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.000]  And it's almost remarkable how soon they got into it. It was only like seven minutes into the
[34:28.000 --> 34:33.280]  thing and all of us, including three minutes of it for a purely promotional video at the beginning.
[34:33.280 --> 34:38.880]  Yeah. And it was like, here, here they are. Here's, you know, here's what they,
[34:38.880 --> 34:43.680]  here's what they look like. Here's what they do. Here's what's new and back to Tim, and he was
[34:43.680 --> 34:47.840]  off the stage. And you, you remarked on it at the time, but it was impeccable. It was on the 30
[34:47.840 --> 34:52.720]  minutes. They finished on the two hour mark. It was perfect. Yeah, it was a very tight event. I mean,
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.680]  I guess, you know, two hours is to them. And I think rightly so, it's like the upper limit.
[34:57.680 --> 35:03.040]  And if they do rehearsal and it's two hours and 10 minutes, no matter how uncomfortable it seems
[35:03.040 --> 35:06.480]  10 minutes of stuff is going to get cut. Yeah, absolutely.
[35:09.360 --> 35:15.280]  Let's take a second break, and we'll get back to this. And I guess maybe interrupt the idea of
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.520]  going through the show and talk a little bit more about the, the new iPhones. Sure.
[35:21.520 --> 35:28.240]  I'm going to talk about a second sponsor. I'm sorry, friends at Drobo. Drobo's slogan is smart
[35:28.240 --> 35:34.400]  storage to protect what matters. What's Drobo? It's a gadget you buy. It's external storage that you
[35:34.400 --> 35:41.360]  buy. And it's expandable. So you buy a Drobo and you can plug expanded capacity into it on the fly
[35:41.360 --> 35:49.920]  by adding drives. So it's not a drive. It's sort of sort of like a raid, except that Drobo stuff is
[35:49.920 --> 35:53.840]  all sort of custom. And they let you do things you can't do with a raid, like just pull a hard
[35:53.840 --> 35:59.840]  drive out, plug another one in. Really cool stuff. Like if it's lights up green, it means that
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.400]  drive, you could just pull it out anytime. So if you've got like your Drobo setup with a whole bunch
[36:04.400 --> 36:11.120]  of one terabyte drives, it looks like a larger than that collective storage. And you're getting
[36:11.120 --> 36:17.120]  close to the limit. You can just pull one of the ones that's green out, plug a three terabyte drive
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.960]  in and Drobo will just take care of it. And what that means is that all the stuff your bits,
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.440]  your ones and zeros, are replicated across those drives so that one physical drive that goes bad
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.160]  isn't going to cause you to lose, to lose data. They've been around for a while.
[36:37.680 --> 36:44.080]  And they just keep getting better and better. The new one, Drobo Gen 3 is three to five times
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.920]  faster than its predecessors. Three to five times faster. It has a new dual core microprocessor
[36:49.920 --> 36:59.200]  built in. And what they're calling a super speed USB 3.0 interface. You could search for reviews
[36:59.200 --> 37:07.840]  online and third party will verify that the performance connected over USB 3 is over 200 megabytes
[37:07.840 --> 37:15.760]  per second. Really good stuff. Fast, it's reliable. It's optimized for time machine. It's almost
[37:15.760 --> 37:22.480]  like the perfect time machine target. Buying one just to use for time machine is a perfectly
[37:22.480 --> 37:30.720]  same idea. You can create separate disk volume on your Drobo partition it. You can create a separate
[37:30.720 --> 37:35.040]  one just for time machine. You could use the whole thing for time machine. Whatever you want to do,
[37:35.040 --> 37:43.120]  very, very configurable. Bottom line, really cool storage. Read all about it.
[37:43.120 --> 37:50.480]  Write way more robust and configurable and expandable. The expandability is the part. You buy one,
[37:50.480 --> 37:55.120]  get it set up and later on you can make it bigger without even shutting down your computer or
[37:55.120 --> 38:04.640]  unmounting the Drobo. And a starting price of just $349, which is one third less than its predecessor.
[38:05.520 --> 38:12.800]  And they have a special offer for listeners of the show. 50 bucks off, 50 bucks off your
[38:12.800 --> 38:25.280]  purchase of any Drobo at www.drobostore.com. Drobostore.com using the code Gruber 50. The 50 is
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.800]  for the 50 bucks you'll save. They have the G and Gruber capitalized. I think it might be case sensitive.
[38:30.800 --> 38:38.800]  So Gruber 50 with a capital G and you'll save 50 bucks, which can get you one for just $299.
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.320]  My thanks to Drobo. Good friends of the show. So did you order an iPhone 6?
[38:44.320 --> 38:49.040]  I did. I ordered an iPhone 6 Plus. You got a 6 Plus. So what made you go plus?
[38:49.920 --> 38:54.320]  I sort of want to try it because it is so new. And then there have been big phones on the
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.800]  market before, but Apple's take on it. I find really interesting. I love the idea of the split
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.200]  view controller and landscape mode. And I like the idea of the longer battery, because especially
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.760]  when we go to conferences or events, I'm roaming most of the time. And the radio is just screaming
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.720]  and draining the battery. That and the optically misstabilization. I don't know how big a deal
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.440]  that'll be on the camera, but I'm really, I'm really interested in trying it out.
[39:16.080 --> 39:19.680]  Yeah. Matthew Panzerino's examples were pretty good. I thought at that.
[39:19.680 --> 39:25.280]  Yeah. You know, and it looks like you get an extra stopper too. And it, you know, can help
[39:25.280 --> 39:32.240]  you shoot at a significantly lower ISO speed even than low light. Honestly, having spent a
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.160]  week with him, I wasn't even tempted by, I guess I had to order, I ordered on Friday night,
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.200]  so I'd only been or Thursday night. So I'd only had it for three, three days at that point,
[39:41.200 --> 39:45.440]  but there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted the regular iPhone 6.
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.280]  I think that's the safe, not the safe choices are wrong, but I think that that is the right choice
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.400]  for most people. I think it looks like a lot of people are going for the 6 Plus. And I'm not sure
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.680]  whether that's because they really want a 5.5 inch phone or because they just assume that they
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.120]  or they just feel like every time Apple puts out a new phone, they're going to get the most expensive
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.800]  one with what they assume is the flagship phone. I don't, it's one of those things, you know,
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.720]  and Apple reveals more than most companies, but there's no way that I expect them to reveal the
[40:12.720 --> 40:18.640]  split between the 6 and the 6 Plus because I think that's highly competitive data. But I would
[40:18.640 --> 40:24.800]  be fascinated to know it. And I would also be fascinated to know how it changes over time because
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.800]  I, my hunch is that the early adopter crowd who does things like pre-order one of these before
[40:32.800 --> 40:38.160]  they've ever seen one in the flash, you know, which I would be doing if I had, even if I hadn't
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.680]  had the review units already, I would have been pre-ordering anyway. But let's face it, that's sort
[40:43.680 --> 40:52.400]  of a crazy thing to do. Normal people don't go and buy, you know, 6, 7, 8, $800, $900 devices that
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.280]  they haven't even put in their hands yet. I think that crowd's used towards the bigger size
[40:59.280 --> 41:04.480]  because they're, it's, I don't know, it's just more, I don't know, nerdy that they, you know,
[41:04.480 --> 41:09.360]  they do more work on their phone. It's a little bit less of a passive device and more of an
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.840]  active device. Yeah. Well, there's, there's usually two groups of people on one is people who can
[41:13.840 --> 41:18.560]  only have one device. And this is a group that's been really popular in Southeast Asia. And
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.320]  those are essentially usually lower cost large phones because they have to have a phone. They just,
[41:24.320 --> 41:28.800]  they need it to basically to live and to communicate. But they want as big a screen size as
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.120]  possible. And then you have people in North America who are, they just want something that's a
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.680]  small tablet that they can carry around. And according to people like Ben Beharen, the large size
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.000]  phones, like the Galaxy Note size phones have never sold well in North America previously. So
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.680]  it'll be interesting to see if that's because there's no Apple phone in that category or if it's
[41:45.680 --> 41:52.000]  really because that category only appeals to a niche market in the industry. I didn't mention this
[41:52.000 --> 41:59.280]  in my review. It's in my notes. And I left it out because it seemed, you know, it was long enough.
[41:59.280 --> 42:08.480]  And it's, you know, sometimes you got to start cutting stuff. But I think it is going to severely
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.680]  cannibalize sales of the iPad mini. And I say this to somebody who has used the iPad mini as,
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.240]  as, as my personal, my only personal iPad for ever since it came out two years ago,
[42:20.240 --> 42:25.600]  I even went with the mini that first year when it was not retina. And I'd already gotten used
[42:25.600 --> 42:33.840]  to the retina display. And, you know, which was a huge tradeoff. But I like that size for what I
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.680]  use an iPad for primarily, which is, okay, I'm done working for the day in my office here at home,
[42:39.680 --> 42:45.200]  now I'm downstairs. And I still want to read some stuff, you know, I still want to, you know,
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.080]  do some stuff. But I'm just sitting around the house on the couch or in an armchair or something
[42:50.080 --> 42:56.560]  like that. And I want to use an iPad. I love the mini for that. But I think though, overall,
[42:56.560 --> 43:03.280]  it is this, this device is too close to the mini. And if you, if you have it, the mini just seems
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.400]  pointless, I think that's very true. I think what else, it'll take a while to happen because I think
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.960]  the iPhone six plus is going to be supply constrained or at least much higher constraint than
[43:12.960 --> 43:16.720]  that already is right now. If you order today, it's already at least, I didn't even check today.
[43:16.720 --> 43:23.520]  But yesterday I checked and it that I was Wednesday, the 17th, it was already quoting three to four
[43:23.520 --> 43:31.440]  weeks. And the iPhone six was only quoting three to four days. Yeah. So I think it'll take a while
[43:31.440 --> 43:35.680]  before there's widespread adoption and people who get it, not all of them may like it. Some of
[43:35.680 --> 43:40.000]  them might decide to go to the smaller one. But what I'm most curious about is whether it just
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.480]  simply cannibalizes the iPad mini and Apple said before they'd rather cannibalize their own stuff
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.240]  than somebody else. Or if people who previously have an iPhone five or five S and an iPad mini
[43:50.240 --> 43:58.320]  now move to an iPhone six S and an iPad Air, or maybe theoretically an iPad pro one day, they go
[43:58.320 --> 44:03.440]  from small, small to big big instead of getting nothing on the time. I think it's really, I think
[44:03.440 --> 44:08.560]  it's really going to put a dent in the iPad mini sales. And I think it might put a dent in iPad
[44:08.560 --> 44:16.880]  sales period, at least among people who choose the six plus that it to me really is, you know,
[44:16.880 --> 44:23.200]  I forget exactly how I put it in my review, but it almost is much maybe not quite, but almost as
[44:23.200 --> 44:34.560]  much like 40% more like an iPad Nano, hypothetical iPad Nano than it is an iPhone plus. It's it
[44:34.560 --> 44:44.560]  really to me feels like a new class of device. More than just a big iPhone really does. And a big
[44:44.560 --> 44:52.160]  part of that is the horizontal stuff, you know, the two column layouts. But even in the portrait
[44:52.160 --> 44:57.120]  landscape, vertical landscape, it just feels in hand. It really to me feels like something you have
[44:57.120 --> 45:03.440]  to use with two hands for the most part, which to me is what makes it a different class device
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.840]  than an iPhone. It's almost the inverse of what happened when the iPad mini launched because
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.360]  people were used to having a two handed iPad experience. And the iPhone, the iPad mini was almost
[45:13.360 --> 45:18.400]  a hand and a half. And now people are so used to using the one hand that iPhone, the iPhone plus,
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.600]  iPhone six plus is two, you know, hand and a half to two handed device.
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.360]  The other thing that's curious though, and I think it would be like it's almost like a no brainer.
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.680]  And you don't even, you know, all the times that they've cannibalized their own products,
[45:31.680 --> 45:40.560]  you know, with the iPod Nano just wiping out the iPod iPod mini, even though the mini was the
[45:40.560 --> 45:47.040]  single most popular consumer electronics product in the world at the time. The iPhone having a full
[45:47.040 --> 45:54.960]  unabashed iPod app that eliminated the need to carry a standalone iPod, right? Like the traditional
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.960]  tech company way, with you had a popular franchise like iPod would have been to like make you
[46:00.960 --> 46:06.480]  tether your iPod to your phone somehow or something like that or like the rocker phone like limit
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.320]  the number just artificially limit the number of songs you can put on your iPhone or something
[46:10.320 --> 46:13.840]  like that. They didn't do anything like that. They were like, Hey, it's the bet. Steve Jobs called it
[46:13.840 --> 46:21.520]  the best iPod we've ever made. Fine. Uh, it scary because it was, you know, a hugely popular thing.
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.520]  In this case, I don't even have any reason to fear it because these things don't don't think about
[46:25.520 --> 46:32.800]  that on contract pricing, which is not the true price. Their, their true price is like three times
[46:32.800 --> 46:39.520]  higher than the price of an iPad mini, right? You get iPad mini starting at $299, right? Yeah,
[46:39.520 --> 46:46.800]  it's one of these things off contract unlocked are, you know, $800 devices. Oh, so if people
[46:46.800 --> 46:53.840]  stop buying iPad minis for three or $400, so they can buy $900 iPhone six pluses at, you know,
[46:53.840 --> 46:58.880]  that's sort of like anybody can see the business sense of that. That is great for Apple because
[46:58.880 --> 47:03.200]  they move from a super low margin product to us to a very good margin product. But one of the
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.520]  things that's always impressed me about Apple as a company is that they've never mistaken their
[47:07.520 --> 47:12.240]  products for their businesses. And we see this in technology so often like Microsoft with windows
[47:12.240 --> 47:16.960]  everywhere where they think that they make windows and they really don't Apple never made the
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.280]  mistake that they made iPods, you know, or they made an iPod mini. They knew that they made
[47:21.280 --> 47:26.560]  personal music devices and would evolve those and those became the iPhone. And now they are not
[47:26.560 --> 47:30.960]  an iPad company. They'll kill the iPad if they have a better idea. They just make these
[47:30.960 --> 47:34.960]  similarly these great devices that you can carry around. Whatever the next version of that,
[47:34.960 --> 47:38.960]  they are fearless in moving to it as quickly as possible because they'd rather do it before
[47:38.960 --> 47:42.720]  somebody else does. And they do, you know, get rid of some profits. They leave money on the
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.200]  table by not dragging out every single nickel out of every single product. But I think when you
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.840]  see how long they've been making really good amounts of money that ultimately is to everybody's
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.360]  been in it. A good question that I got asked after my review hit and people, you know,
[47:57.360 --> 48:01.280]  realize I had both phones and they could ask me questions. Didn't occur to me before at all
[48:01.280 --> 48:07.600]  because I don't use it personally. But I got asked by a couple of people on Twitter whether the
[48:07.600 --> 48:13.760]  iPhone 6 Plus in particular or either of the new ones works with the camera connection kit,
[48:13.760 --> 48:19.760]  which is the little lightning thing you plug in. And then you can plug an SD card into an iPad
[48:19.760 --> 48:26.000]  and import photos. You take photos with a regular camera, standalone camera, take the SD card,
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.320]  use the camera connection kit. And instead of putting them on a Mac, you can put them on an iPad.
[48:30.320 --> 48:36.400]  And it's always been an iPad only peripheral. Didn't even occur to me to try it. I did. And it's
[48:36.400 --> 48:41.600]  exactly nothing has changed. As soon as you plug the lightning adapter into either of the new
[48:41.600 --> 48:47.440]  iPhones, it says this peripheral or whatever it's called, is not supported on this device.
[48:49.840 --> 48:55.040]  I wonder though, if that's an oversight because it seems to me like I never quite understood
[48:55.040 --> 49:00.800]  why camera connection kit didn't work with an iPhone. It's never been clear to me technically why
[49:00.800 --> 49:08.640]  that's the case. You know, if anything, iPhones now have just as much storage as iPads,
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.720]  you know, who knows, or maybe they'll double the iPads again. But storage shouldn't be the
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.800]  limiting factor. You know, it should be up to you if you have a 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage,
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.960]  what you use it for. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. And I hope it is an oversight because
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.800]  especially now with the bigger screen phones, it makes so much sense if you're traveling and you
[49:24.800 --> 49:28.320]  have an iPhone 6 Plus, especially you're not going to want to bring an iPad with you, but you
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.960]  might bring a camera with you. You might bring something else like a DSLR. I often take one with
[49:32.960 --> 49:37.680]  me, especially when I go out of town for this kind of photography that I just don't use an iPhone
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.600]  for, but the ability to bring that all in, the DSLRs are still dead. Like there's no,
[49:41.600 --> 49:45.920]  there's no camera play like there is car play. So I need the iPhones to do all the cool,
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.440]  modern connected stuff. Yeah, and you know, hopefully it's an oversight because I think it's a
[49:51.440 --> 49:55.600]  clear use. I mean, at least two people on Twitter specifically, you know, and I take it that they're
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.000]  either avid, avid amateur, or maybe even professional photographers. I didn't ask the details,
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.040]  but that they, you know, go out in the field with an iPad and use that as their, you know,
[50:07.040 --> 50:11.520]  in the field editing and storage device. And they would rather replace it with this, you know,
[50:11.520 --> 50:17.520]  for the obvious reason that it's crazy small compared to an iPad. It's a great way to show off your
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.760]  portfolio, especially for photographers. A lot of them like the iPad because they can carry a lot of
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.920]  your graphics work with the photography worth of them. And the iPad 6 and 6 Plus will be great for
[50:25.920 --> 50:31.840]  that too. Yeah, I'm trying to think if there was anything else that I left out of my review that
[50:31.840 --> 50:38.880]  could use here, but I can't think of anything. I did want to mention the two, and see what you
[50:38.880 --> 50:47.680]  think about them, but the two big, well, one's big and one maybe is not as big, but the two negative
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.640]  things I had to say about the Apple's decisions. The first, and it's the clearly the biggest,
[50:52.640 --> 50:58.160]  is their decision to keep the entry level on both phones at 16 gigabytes and so that the split
[50:58.160 --> 51:09.520]  between 1.99, 2.99, 3.99, and 2.99, 3.99, 4.99 for the two phones is 16, 64, 128 instead of what
[51:09.520 --> 51:16.480]  to me looks more natural would be double the mall, 32, 64, 128. And I really, like I said in my
[51:16.480 --> 51:22.400]  in my review, it almost seems punitive to only to ship one of these with only 16 gigabytes. I mean,
[51:22.400 --> 51:29.120]  the original iPhone, the most popular model of it, and back in 2007 had eight gigabytes. So,
[51:29.120 --> 51:34.960]  the only double it since the original eight product generations ago is ridiculous. And then I
[51:34.960 --> 51:40.560]  forgot about this because I bought my iPhone on day one, but Apple like six months after the original,
[51:40.560 --> 51:45.520]  this is the original iPhone, the original one, the one that only got two 2G networking,
[51:46.400 --> 51:51.840]  they shipped a 16 gigabyte model of it, like in January or something like that. Do you remember that?
[51:51.840 --> 51:56.560]  Yeah, with the price cut, they also increased the storage. Yeah. So, in other words,
[51:56.560 --> 52:04.960]  the low end iPhone six plus today has the same amount of storage as the high end original iPhone
[52:04.960 --> 52:10.960]  back in 2007, that to me is it's just nuts. I'm actually having the same hard drive space on the
[52:10.960 --> 52:16.880]  low end as a 2007 year in MacBook. Yeah, it's really, and I keep seeing everybody today as they
[52:16.880 --> 52:22.080]  upgrade to iOS eight is running into these problems where you need like it wants four gigabytes free
[52:22.960 --> 52:30.160]  to or four and a half gigabytes free to do the OS update. Well, how is that? How are you going to,
[52:30.160 --> 52:33.760]  if you've got a 16 gigabyte iPhone today, how in the world are you going to have four gigabytes
[52:33.760 --> 52:38.400]  free next year when iOS nine comes out? And it's worse in some ways because they're still selling
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.480]  an eight gigabyte iPhone five C in their, you know, they've sold eight gigabyte models in
[52:42.480 --> 52:47.360]  India and China and other brick countries before, you know, maybe there'll be an eight gigabyte
[52:47.360 --> 52:51.440]  iPhone five S eventually who knows. And that last year, you know, there was no way you I could
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.680]  recommend that phone to anybody. It's just, it's almost unusable at that point. And now 16 feels
[52:55.680 --> 53:03.520]  like that. I own eight gigabytes and with the size of iOS, I honestly wonder how if you took one
[53:03.520 --> 53:08.480]  and did a factory restore on and wiped all of your personal stuff off every photo we've ever
[53:08.480 --> 53:13.920]  taken. None of your own music do a factory restore. Is there going to be enough room to install
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.120]  iOS nine over the air? I don't even know if that's true. I mean, it's, to me, that's crazy,
[53:19.920 --> 53:30.160]  given what has to be the relatively low price differential Apple would pay for the to double those.
[53:30.160 --> 53:34.960]  It's punitive is a good word for it as someone also made an analogy to airlines and how you have
[53:34.960 --> 53:40.480]  economy class business class and first class and how economy class is deliberately made more
[53:40.480 --> 53:45.200]  miserable in an effort to, you know, maybe upsell the premium seating options that are next to
[53:45.200 --> 53:49.520]  50 bucks, whatever. And this, the typical marketing thing is have the entry level model that gets
[53:49.520 --> 53:55.040]  people in the door. But that entry level model, maybe they still believe that if it was 32 gigs,
[53:55.040 --> 53:58.320]  more people would opt for that and then be fewer people moving to the medium tier and they
[53:58.320 --> 54:04.320]  really want the medium tier to be the normal one. I guess that's the only explanation. Honestly,
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.200]  that, I think that has to be it. So I'm not trying to act stupid. Like I don't see that angle,
[54:09.200 --> 54:15.760]  but I honestly think that's beneath Apple and in long, in the long run, whatever, whatever increase
[54:15.760 --> 54:20.800]  in active, not active selling, average selling price that are going to get because of this,
[54:22.240 --> 54:27.440]  the, the way they've made these tiers. However, much money they're going to make on that to me
[54:27.440 --> 54:33.680]  is probably going to be less than the damage it's doing to their brand by selling brand new iPhone
[54:33.680 --> 54:40.320]  six and six pluses that honestly, I think cannot be recommended. I really, I would honestly say
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.360]  that anybody out there looking for buying advice, pretend like those ones don't exist,
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.640]  and that the starting price is $2.99 and $3.99 on contract for the 64 gigabyte models,
[54:50.640 --> 54:55.680]  whereas I think 32 gigabytes would be fine. If you think that, you know, knowing how much space
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.400]  you use on your phone now, you know, knowing how much of your music and video collection you like
[55:00.400 --> 55:06.160]  to carry around on the device, you know, I like to put my whole music library on the device,
[55:06.160 --> 55:14.240]  which already puts me close to 64 or at least in, you know, over 32. And then with 128,
[55:14.240 --> 55:19.360]  I will know, you know, for the last couple of months, every couple of weeks, I have to delete
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.080]  stuff from my phone because I get a warning that I'm used up the whole 64 gigs because of shooting
[55:24.080 --> 55:30.800]  high-def video and panoramic photos and stuff. So I really want and can use the 128. But I can see
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.520]  how somebody who doesn't store their music could easily get by with 32 and have room to spare
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.800]  next year to upgrade iOS 9 and stuff like that. But 16 to me is really a disappointment.
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.880]  There's, I've heard an argument from some people in the brick countries that all the phones are
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.800]  used for mailing those countries because of the way that data plans are set up. You'll get just a
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.520]  phone with a little bit of data and maybe Facebook messenger or BBM or something. And it's primarily
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.520]  a text-based communication device because voice plans are so expensive. And I also wonder if this,
[55:59.520 --> 56:02.800]  if the carrier's mandate or there's some sort of agreement or there's some feeling that they
[56:02.800 --> 56:08.160]  have to have the brand new iPhone at 199 still because it'd be interesting to see they did keep
[56:08.160 --> 56:13.600]  around the 32 gigabyte iPhone 5S. If they let that just be the the 199 device and the new
[56:13.600 --> 56:22.960]  iPhone started at 299 with 32 gigs. I refuse to believe that if they made the entry-level ones 32 that it would
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.280]  adversely affect their margins. And again, I say this knowing like I said on this show with, I think
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.640]  it was with molds a couple of episodes back. It's so easy to armchair quarterback this and tell
[56:32.640 --> 56:38.160]  Apple to make these decisions that, you know, they really ought to spend more money and go from
[56:38.160 --> 56:43.680]  16 to 32. Whereas if you multiply out 100 million phones per year and the difference, you know,
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.400]  even if it's only a dollar per phone, it's, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. And I agree,
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.120]  you know, hundreds of millions of dollars is nothing to sneeze at even for Apple. But in this
[56:53.120 --> 56:58.320]  particular case, it's just too much given the way they use it. And, you know, they're really
[56:58.320 --> 57:04.560]  promoting these features, you know, with the improved camera, which I think is a huge selling point,
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.880]  a huge reason to upgrade for for regular people in these cameras. The panoramic photos have gone to
[57:10.880 --> 57:17.280]  like 50 megapixels or 50 megabytes or I forget what, you know, but they're, they're like twice the
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.000]  size of the old panoramic ones. And you have the time lapse to where you can take all those photos
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.120]  and combine them to a video. I mean, these are going to be huge. People are going to generate huge
[57:25.120 --> 57:29.360]  amounts of content. And I also have to wonder if they did go to 32 gigabytes. If any difference
[57:29.360 --> 57:33.680]  will be made up because people might buy more iCloud storage or they might buy more apps
[57:33.680 --> 57:38.800]  because they can fit, you know, more, more premium games, more large size gigabyte filling games
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.360]  on their phone. I mean, it just seems like there's, there's better ways of getting people into the
[57:43.360 --> 57:49.040]  iPhone. And being an amateur camera guy, I know how amazing it is that you can buy a camera now that
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.840]  does 240 frames per second slow motion, right? That's just a couple years ago, that was like a
[57:53.840 --> 57:59.360]  really, I mean, shooting that level of slowmo was expensive. And it was hard to find on any kind of
[57:59.360 --> 58:04.720]  vaguely consumerish camera. Now you have it on your phone, but by definition, a hundred,
[58:04.720 --> 58:09.680]  240 frames per section is double the, the storage size of 120 frames per second.
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.560]  Did you see that 4K app for $1,000 on the app store? No. Yeah. Tell me about it.
[58:14.560 --> 58:18.720]  So I forget the manufacturer, but they're a well-known video production company. They made
[58:18.720 --> 58:23.280]  really smart iPhone and iPad apps. For example, they're the ones who made the app that you can
[58:23.280 --> 58:27.680]  go out into a crowd with a bunch of different people. And everyone will send their video back
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.160]  to the same iPhone or iPad, and you can do multi cam editing. And so the new one basically uses
[58:32.160 --> 58:36.400]  the camera instead of the video camera and takes multiple pictures and stitches them together into
[58:36.400 --> 58:43.600]  4K video right on your iPhone. Wow. Yeah. There's, there's really good camera stuff,
[58:43.600 --> 58:47.840]  especially in iOS 8. I have to check that out. What's the name of the app? I have to look it up,
[58:47.840 --> 58:51.680]  but it's, it does 4K video and it's $1,000. I'm guessing there's only going to be one of them.
[58:51.680 --> 59:00.400]  4K, it's, I am rich, but actually useful. 4K video app for $1,000. God, I'm in the wrong
[59:00.400 --> 59:06.880]  business. Vespir with 4K. Right. That's amazing. I'll have to look that up. I'll try to
[59:06.880 --> 59:14.240]  remember to put it in the show notes. But I'll probably forget. But what else? I, you know,
[59:14.240 --> 59:18.320]  I don't know. I mean, as a guy who just wrote a 4,000 word review of the two phones,
[59:18.320 --> 59:22.240]  it's, you know, I feel silly saying there's not that much more to talk about, but I don't
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.600]  know that there's that much more to talk about. I apologize. It's a busy week 4K is the name
[59:25.600 --> 59:42.640]  of the app. Busy wig. Okay. Busy wig. How do you spell that? V-I-Z-Z-Y-W-I-G. W-I-G. W-I-G. Okay. This is wig. Whatever.
[59:42.640 --> 59:54.800]  Well, that seems like a weird name for $1,000 app. I thought it was interesting that they sold
[59:54.800 --> 1:00:00.960]  more phones than ever before by apparently a long shot. Yeah, it was 4 million pre-orders.
[1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:06.400]  Yeah, even with the whole pre-order system, shitting the bed almost completely.
[1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:13.280]  Yeah, I saw you tweet. I was up until, um, I think 4 5 a.m. before I got my pre-orders done.
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:20.400]  Eastern time? Yeah. Oh, I was up later than that. Yeah, that's, no, because it was only 3 a.m.
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:24.640]  Eastern time when they went live. It was supposed to go live. Yeah, and Apple.com, the main
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.640]  store page didn't go live, but a couple friends of mine sent me direct links about an hour
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:33.760]  an hour and a half later, which actually worked. I was on the West Coast, uh, in Portland for
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:40.240]  Exo Exo. Um, and so it was midnight for us when it first went live. And I tried to, I, last year,
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:49.520]  I used the, um, the app, the Apple store app. And at the stroke of midnight, I opened the app,
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:57.520]  and it was like not ready yet. And then I reloaded, like went back to home screen,
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:03.840]  and opened the app again, and it was there, and it was ready. And it was like, I don't know, 12OO15. And
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:14.720]  I clicked, um, you know, iPhone 5S, space gray, 64 Verizon, upgrade this phone that I'm on
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:22.560]  right now. And, you know, credit card authorization, and by like 120130, I was done. And I was it.
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:28.560]  And Amy was with me and she did the same thing. And, you know, then we were, that was it.
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:34.000]  I got an email and, you know, the next Friday my phone came. This time we, I spent, I don't know,
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  two hours sitting there, you know, we were having drinks and socializing, but I spent like two hours
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.720]  in the app. I went to the Apple store.com. And no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to work.
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:47.680]  And I eventually had to resort to going to Verizon.
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:52.560]  The app was, for me, the app started before the website did and it would let me pick the phone I wanted,
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:55.280]  but the buttons to actually order it never activated.
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:59.040]  Yeah, that's exactly what I, well, I had trouble getting there. I would say most,
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:02.960]  every, most times I tried, I never even got that far. About one out of three times I tried,
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:10.560]  I'd get all the way to the part where it let me pick iPhone 6, space gray, 128 Verizon,
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.440]  and the button to say add this to cart just never activated. Such a tease.
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:20.800]  Yeah, but right next to me, it worked for Amy eventually, but just randomly, you know, like 20 minutes
[1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:25.600]  in that she was there. It's just sitting on that screen with the inactive add to cart button,
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:29.280]  and then all of a sudden the add to cart button went live and that was it.
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:31.920]  Everybody loves Amy. Oh, I don't know about that.
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:36.720]  But yeah, and it was strange because watching the carrier sites, some of them announced they
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:40.720]  go up later and they came up earlier. Some people could get to Verizon, some couldn't, some could get
[1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:45.680]  to AT&T, some couldn't, some got waiting listed, team mobile took forever. It was, they do this
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:50.560]  every year and they still can't get there shit together. And it's the most, Verizon's worked.
[1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:56.240]  I don't think that I had, I went through in one shot with no bugs, but it's such a design nightmare.
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:00.640]  And doing it on the phone makes it worse because their site is not mobile optimized, really
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:05.440]  small fonts, lots of pinching and zooming and panning around. But I was out. I didn't have
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:10.080]  anything else to order with. I had to use the phone. And I just, you know, it ends up, I think I could
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.880]  have still ordered the next morning and still gotten Friday delivery, but that's because I wanted
[1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:18.960]  the sex. And I didn't want to take that chance that it would come right away, you know, that it would
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:26.960]  go to two, three weeks delivery. I have the Verizon website design wise. And in terms of the ways that
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:34.560]  they try to trick you and get you to buy, like get it with a protection plan, get it with a car
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.720]  charger. Like those bad domain registration sites. Yeah, exactly. And just the layout of it and the
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:45.120]  colors, all this red, it just reminds me of like what it would be like to like get your driver's
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:51.280]  license. And if the Soviet Union, we're still around. Yeah, it's like, it's like some kind of,
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:57.200]  I don't know, it's probably like what the internet is like in North Korea. Yeah, it's like go
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:04:03.200]  pressive. No, and it's a company that is designed to sell you phones, cannot sell you phones effectively
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.000]  on there. Well, you know, apple.com just went responsive. So I don't want to be too critical. But
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.880]  if you're selling products that involve mobile, you really should work on mobile.
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:17.440]  Yeah, I says a guy whose, whose website isn't yet responsive and whose number one platform for
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:21.280]  page views is iOS. I was really, that's the thing that bumming out about apple going,
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:27.040]  raspl.com going responsive is I really thought that was the thing that I could, I could still
[1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:31.360]  lean against and say, well, I'm not the last, you know, it looks like I'm going to be last.
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:38.720]  Uh, let me take a break here and thank, uh, thank our next sponsor or good friends at

[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:41.680]  What about you? Do you have any questions about the iPhone six or six plus for someone from someone
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:47.440]  who's used it? Uh, not that I can think of. I mean, I got to spend about 20 minutes with them in
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:51.360]  the demo room. So nowhere nearly enough to get my hands on them. But I'm not sure I'm going to be
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:56.800]  able to make any sort of opinion until I've used them for a week. What I liked about your review is
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:01.120]  that you use both of them for a period of time and that really sort of cemented how the
[1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:08.480]  iPhone six plus wasn't for you. Yeah, I, I, you know, I'm not good at doing, you know,
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:14.960]  my, I work slowly and I think slowly and I really wish I wished that I had two weeks to do it.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:20.240]  So I could have done a full week with each one. It just seemed to me like if I switched back and
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:25.040]  forth every day all day for a week, I'd never get a good sense of either. So I thought I'll do
[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:31.680]  three with the plus first, then three with the six and then, you know, write my review on the seventh
[1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:40.480]  day. Uh, and it, you know, when I went when I switched from the plus and I, you know, I did,
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:46.560]  I would say 98% of my iPhone usage was on the device I was using. I had to wear it one or two
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:55.280]  things that I used my personal iPhone for because I didn't have it on the review unit. Um, I couldn't
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:09:02.240]  get Uber working, for example, on that thing. And it was a weird, you know, the, um, um, you know
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:09.120]  this that the location settings in iOS 8 have changed to be more fine grained. Yeah. Well,
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:14.960]  existing apps that haven't been updated for iOS 8, it puts the end at wanting to use your location.
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.560]  It puts them in a weird spot where they, it's like Uber wasn't asking me, hey, can I use
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:26.720]  location services? I'd never even got prompted. Um, it would just give me an error and it gave me
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:31.440]  the error when I was signing in. I would type my email address in my Uber password and hit,
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:36.160]  okay. And instead of saying your password is good, you're in or your password wasn't entered
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.400]  correctly. Try it again. After I hit sign in, it would say your location can't be determined.
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:46.480]  Yeah. And I, it took me like days to figure this out. And then I was, I thought, oh, it's, it's not
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:55.040]  the phone. It's iOS 8. I went to settings location, Uber. And it's, Uber was listed as one of the apps
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:03.600]  that wanted location. But instead of saying that it was set to don't allow or allow or allow only
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.880]  when I'm in the app, it was set to nothing. It was like nothing at all. So if I tapped Uber and then
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:14.320]  just said here, let it use my location while I'm in the app, uh, then I went back to Uber and it all
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:19.200]  worked. But in the meantime, I had to order Uber's around San Francisco. I had to use my real iPhone.
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:22.960]  So there's just one example of something that I couldn't do. But everything other than that,
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:28.720]  I used the review phones. When I switched after three days to the iPhone six, it was like,
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:33.280]  wow, this is a relief. I think, you know, there's, it's almost an arguable that the iPhone six is
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:37.680]  a linear successor to the iPhones that have come before and the iPhone six plus like you pointed out
[1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:42.560]  is really something new. And we know some people who've had them for a while now. And they,
[1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:46.080]  you know, the comments are the same. It's not a one handed device. Kind of scared of
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:50.400]  dropping it when I try to use it one handed. And I think it's, it's really important that people
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:53.520]  think of it as something else or they might just get it thinking it's the next iPhone.
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:59.040]  Yeah. I do wonder, like I wrote last year, I do wonder whether there's going to be some
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:04.640]  amount of buyers regret where somebody goes in the store and it just looks so impressive.
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:13.360]  Because it does. I mean, it is, uh, it's just a striking device physically. Um, and they're going
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:17.200]  to say, wow, that looks so awesome. I'm going to get that one. And then when they actually get it,
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:20.480]  they start running into problems, like it's hard to get out of your pocket while you're sitting
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:25.280]  down. It's hard to put back in your pocket while you're sitting down. Well, imagine if you go into
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.800]  Best Buy and every television was subsidized. So they were all 200 or 300 dollars regardless of
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:36.720]  the size. And you just see 120 inch television and it's 300 bucks and you're going to make it yours.
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.880]  And then you get home and you realize there's no way to get that thing in unless you take down a
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:48.320]  wall. It's something I might be something like that. I don't know. Uh, I compared it to like the way
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:53.920]  that people tend to buy over saturated TVs in Best Buy because when you look at them side by side,
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:57.360]  you're not really imagining, you know, you're not looking at it in the right context. And the
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:02.720]  extra saturation is striking and you think it looks good. And then you get at home and it's like
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:08.080]  you realize that skin tones are just way off and everything is, it doesn't look good. It just looks
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:11.680]  vibrant. And I don't want to scare anybody off because there are going to be people that it is
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:14.880]  going to be a tremendous productivity boom for them. And they're going to love it. And they're
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:20.640]  going to survive with a small screen before. Yeah, I think it's, you know, but I think most people
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:27.120]  know it when they see it. Um, I had to laugh and I loved it. I didn't mention it online, but I loved
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:32.480]  Panzorino's review. Um, I thought it was such a great idea to, you know, they, you know, it maybe
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:36.400]  was like a happy coincidence because a, you know, his family already had the Disneyland trip planned.
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:44.400]  But what a great, what a great stress test for review units of a phone than something like that,
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:49.760]  which, you know, is it, you know, you naturally, you don't have to contrive reasons to shoot photos
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.560]  or videos. You're on a family vacation at Disneyland. You're going to want to shoot photos and videos.
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:58.720]  And the lighting conditions are all over the place because you might be out in bright daylight
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:04.080]  walking around the park and then you go on a ride where it's super dark. I thought that was a
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:12.480]  great review, but I had to laugh at his crazy idea of masking the two phones in Android,
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.640]  Android smartphone cases and then cutting a hole for, you know, the difference in the camera
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:23.760]  location. Like you don't have to do that. Like he, he should have reread the, the embargo agreement
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:29.760]  that, that, yeah, get from Apple when you get a review, like you're allowed to use them in real life.
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:33.520]  You don't have to hide them. You don't have to disguise them. Like you're, you know, there'd
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:38.640]  be no other way to do a real world review. You can go out and just use the phone and you don't have to,
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:43.840]  they give you cases, you know, to, you know, their cases so you can review the cases too, if you want.
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:48.960]  But since I don't use a case in real life, I don't use a case with my review phones either. I just
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:55.360]  use them. There are rules. I mean, for example, everybody knows there's an embargo of when you're
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:02.560]  allowed to publish any, any kind of writing about it. And you're also not allowed. And this part,
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:06.480]  I'm actually thinking about emailing them and seeing if they might reconsider it. You're not
[1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:12.880]  allowed to post to any social media of photo that you've taken with it, which once or twice,
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.680]  and I stick to it, but once or twice I get XOXO, it kind of stunk, because all the photos I was
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:21.520]  taking, I couldn't Instagram any of them. I have to like what they call it, later grandma.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:29.200]  And that is sort of a, it actually sort of makes it so that you can't fully use these review
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:33.280]  phones the way I would use a real phone, because I do post things to Instagram or photos to Twitter.
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:38.720]  But you know that a bunch of websites, a minute that happens, we'll say first iPhone,
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.120]  six camera shots appear on social networks and they'll analyze a flicker information.
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:50.320]  Yeah, I kind of see what, you know, I am sure that's exactly why the rule exists. And, you know,
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:55.360]  and it's a very, the way they have it written now is a simple rule. You can't share photos
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:00.320]  from taking with this camera over a social network. Simple. Yes or no, you can't do it. Whereas what
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:06.240]  I guess I kind of want them to do is I wish I could do it without, but with the rule that I can't say,
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.760]  hey, I took this with an iPhone 6, you know, and here, here's a version of the same scene
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:17.120]  taken with an iPhone 5, look at the difference, you know, in advance of the embargo date. But
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:23.200]  just posting, you know, without commenting on it, I don't know. And I don't even know,
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:28.480]  like does Instagram keep the exit data? I know flicker does. So flicker, I could see flicker,
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:34.480]  I could see, I would, I could see them making maybe a white list of you can post to Twitter and
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:39.840]  Instagram if it, if like exit data is stripped from those apps or something like that.
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.600]  Any website that makes horribly compressed overly filtered versions of your photographs are
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:48.320]  fine to post to. Exactly. Right. So maybe they could white list a few. But anyway, it's a bit of,
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:54.160]  you know, it's a bit of a hassle not be able to do it. I liked Pan's Reno's review too,
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:58.320]  because he's a, he was a professional photographer and he knows to look for things like how it
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:03.280]  handles saturated reds that, you know, I don't, that not everyone will look for. And also the
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:08.160]  Austin man piece that ran on his blog and the verge we took it with him to Iceland, you know,
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:12.800]  just to see, I cannot ever make photographs like that. But I like to see what the potential is with
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:17.040]  someone who really knows how to use that camera. Yeah, his, his review made me feel so much better
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.080]  about not really having done any foot photography testing of mine that I just sort of ran out of
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:26.720]  time and just ran it and didn't really take any side by side pictures to really compare it as
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:31.280]  like, well, it would have been a waste of time anyway, because his review blew it away in terms of
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:35.040]  depth and expertise in terms of foot photography. Yeah, it's like watching it at someone in the
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:38.560]  middle earth take around the life on six ridiculous. Right. So it just made me laugh though that
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:44.240]  Pan's Reno went around Disney World with his, his iPhone sixes in these horribly janky
[1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:49.840]  cut up with hotel scissors, Android cases, when he could have just used them out and about,
[1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:53.280]  but I will say as somebody who did that for the last week, using it just out and about,
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:59.600]  people recognized it like last year, I don't think anybody did like I, because I had an iPhone,
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:04.560]  I forget what color it was. I already had a gold one. I had gold five ass. So I guess some
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:08.960]  people did notice there were some people who noticed because I had a gold one and gold was new,
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:12.800]  but if I had had a space gray one, nobody would have known, even though space gray is a different
[1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:18.160]  color than the black that came before it. People just don't really notice, you know, it's iPhones
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:23.280]  and iPhone. The gold, a couple people noticed, but testing these two phones in the wild, especially
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:29.600]  the plus, uh, just complete strangers would say, oh my God, is that the new iPhone over and over
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:34.480]  and over again to the point where, and I didn't want to be photographed using it. I didn't want
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:38.720]  anybody posting pictures of me using it. So I would say, yes, and you're allowed to you, you're,
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.400]  you know, you can, you don't have to lie, you don't have to suddenly run away or something like
[1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:47.040]  you can say, yes, it's an iPhone, you know, six plus, um, it's a review unit from Apple.
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:52.320]  Um, but you're not allowed to let people touch it and you're not allowed to demonstrate it in a
[1:17:52.320 --> 1:17:58.640]  public way. So you can't say, sure, gather around employees of Superduper Burger, and I will show you
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:05.760]  the, the iPhone six plus. So you kind of have to be a little bit of a jerk about it, but, uh,
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:10.000]  but you don't have to hide it. And it's, you know, you don't have to lie about it or anything
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.200]  like that or put it in that case. Is that the same as last year? Did that change as well?
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:17.760]  No, that's always been the same as far as at least since I've been reviewing them, which started
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:22.400]  with the Verizon iPhone four. Well, it's much better way to test it. If that, if the, if the
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:26.000]  embargo or the NDA was stricter than that, it'd probably not be a functional test for you.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:30.480]  Right. It really wouldn't be if you had to, you know, you know, disguise it or something like that,
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:34.560]  locked in a room. Right. Because even if I had to put it in some kind of case,
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:40.080]  it would have affected my ability to judge just how pocketable it is without a case,
[1:18:40.080 --> 1:18:45.600]  which is really what it is. It's so many things. Right. Um, so that made me laugh.
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  It was a great, great extra paragraph or two in his article though. Yeah. It made me laugh
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:56.240]  though knowing the rules. Um, what do you think about, I guess if there's anything else that's
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:01.360]  controversial about the design of the two phones, it's the camera nubbin or the bulge as I'm
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:05.760]  calling it, I'm not quite sure what to call it. One thing a couple people on Twitter pointed out,
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:10.400]  and again, because I don't use a case, I guess it occurred to me, but it didn't really pop to
[1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:17.680]  my forefront is for anybody who does use their iPhone in a case, which I do believe to be a majority
[1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:21.920]  if not an overwhelming majority of iPhone users. Just out and about in a real world, it seems to
[1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:27.760]  me like certainly many people don't, but it seems like most people do use a case. And if you do
[1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:33.600]  use a case, it's absolutely irrelevant because even the thinnest of cases is going to be thinner than
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:39.920]  the thickness of the bulge around the, uh, camera lens. Yeah, absolutely. And even, uh, I think some
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:44.800]  people point us out to people who make accessories, like all o clip can now have use that as a
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:49.840]  guide to make sure that it stays in place when they put it on. Yeah, it's, you know, I would never
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:55.520]  go so far as to argue that it's there for a feature and not a, you know, a design trade-off,
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:00.960]  but there is it's sort of like a silver lining in in the trade-off. Well, I mean, I've
[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:05.600]  pod touch had this two years ago, three years ago, whenever that launched, and it's because
[1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:09.840]  cameras Apple talks about the five element lens and cameras really need depth. That's why
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:14.400]  lenses sometimes are so thick. It's, and the phones they want to make super thin, and that creates
[1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:18.080]  a huge tension and make the phone thinner. They have to make a worse camera. They're not going to do
[1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:22.880]  that. They did, they did a miracle of engineering with the iPhone five to get that eight megapixel
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:28.000]  camera in there. And I don't think they could, I'm sure they tried. I don't think they could get it
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:31.840]  into a, a phone as thin as these. And like you said, that was a compromise they had to make.
[1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:38.800]  Yeah. Uh, well, it's not that, you know, I presented three options. First would be use a camera
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.320]  that fits flush and has worse optics. I think that was out of the question because I believe
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:49.200]  a camera of that size not only would a, certainly would have had worse optics than the one they
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:54.160]  did include, but it might have even had worse optics. Probably would have had worse optics
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:59.360]  than the five S or the five C. And that's just unacceptable. They can't sell the high-end iPhone
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:03.840]  with a camera that's worse than the one from a year or two before. Uh, just it's, you know,
[1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:10.880]  an incon, inconceivable. There's no magic option to just magically make it happen. And I've seen
[1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:15.680]  it on Twitter, a handful of people on Twitter who if Steve Jobs was there, he would have browbeat
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:21.440]  them into making a camera that was, that thin enough and didn't sacrifice image quality. Well,
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:28.160]  that's not how it worked. He was a, you know, a great motivator. And he often drove people to do
[1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:34.640]  more than they could think they could. Uh, I don't think he could bend the laws of physics. And,
[1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:39.040]  you know, they still do, they did, you know, they do things like use Sony sensors, you know,
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:42.400]  they use components. They don't, the camera isn't entirely their own creation. They have,
[1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:47.600]  like a Sony sensor in there, which already places a starting limit on how far away the lens has
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:54.960]  to be to, to, uh, cover the whole sensor with an image. So I'm going to say that, that was out.
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:22:00.160]  I think the choice came between, um, doing what they did and having a bulge around the
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:07.520]  camera lens or making the whole device as thick as needed be just to sit flush with the camera
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:13.760]  that they have. And then they're, you know, make the battery a little thicker to, to take advantage
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:18.240]  of that extra space where they could have. And that's the thing that I've a lot of people pushed
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:22.720]  back on my review about that they should have because that would have been better. There's,
[1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:29.200]  it still would have been thinner than the five S. How is that not thin enough? And then battery
[1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:33.440]  life would have been better on the both phones, you know, that this is folly on Apple's part
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:38.320]  because it would have been better for everybody because, uh, a little bit that much more thickness
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:41.680]  wouldn't have mattered. It still would have been a thin phone and then battery life would have been
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:45.360]  better. It's, it's really interesting because a lot of people went Apple went to the iPhone 5 and
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:49.280]  that was thinner than the iPhone 4S that, you know, just keep it the same as the 4S. I want more
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:54.960]  battery, but everything really is a trade off. And I think Apple is more consistent as, as obsessed
[1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:59.920]  as they are with thinness and they, they've made an entirely new, uh, backlight just to get a thinner.
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:04.000]  I think that just because it translates into weight. And I've got it. Like I said, I've got
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.520]  Alumia 1020 and that feels like a brick. And the Nexus 5 is about the same size and it feels,
[1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:13.600]  even though it's the same size, it feels so much smaller because it's lighter. And the iPhone 6 Plus
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:18.560]  felt smaller again than a lot of those phones or than the Galaxy Note. And I think Apple realized
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:22.960]  when they went big, one of their goals was to be light so that it didn't, it didn't end up feeling
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:29.600]  like a weaponized instrument in your hand. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it is like I wrote my review. It's heavier,
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:36.160]  the six is heavier than the five S, but it doesn't feel heavier because I think by, you know,
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:43.520]  by mass, it's actually lighter, you know, per per volume. It's, it's lighter, even though overall,
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:47.760]  it's, it's actually a little heavier. And it's that illusion thing again too, because I had a chance
[1:23:47.760 --> 1:23:52.080]  to see a bunch of people using them during the week. And you look at it, then you look at your
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:56.320]  iPhone 5 and it's that same feelings when you look back on an iPhone 4S now and it looks like a
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:24:00.560]  stunted little iPhone mini. It's that once you see that because of the curves, because of the way
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:05.040]  that it's built, it just looks so much newer than the iPhone 5. And I think that whole thing
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:12.640]  combines together to make the big size more acceptable. Yeah. Um, I think it's reasonable,
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:18.160]  it's perfectly reasonable to argue the side of they should have just made both phones a little thicker
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:24.080]  to let the camera sit flush and have put slightly bigger batteries in perfectly reasonable.
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:29.600]  I think it's not reasonable to argue that what Apple did choose to do is also reasonable,
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:37.200]  and that Apple simply prioritizes this thinness and weight a little bit more than other people do.
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:41.920]  Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because I believe the iPod touch, at least it was certainly
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:47.120]  designed. Well, Steve Jobs was still around in that ship. There was no banding shipping that.
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:52.560]  So I think, you know, that's not a good thing. Yeah, it's, you know, we're running out of time to say,
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:58.320]  no, actually Steve Jobs actually was there for that. But that's the protruding camera lens.
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:03.120]  You can't say Steve Jobs never would have done it because he did, he was there when the iPod
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:10.560]  touch that has that was was, uh, was designed. Yeah. Uh, I don't think people, some people have said,
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.920]  do they need to, do they need to buy a case now? Because otherwise, if you put your phone flat
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:19.440]  on a table or something like that, the lens is going to get scratched. I don't think the lens is
[1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:24.880]  any more likely to get scratched than it was on the five S because it's still a sapphire cover
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:33.440]  on the outside of the lens. Uh, and if anything that the metal ring around it would be less likely to
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.840]  have the, you know, the lens actually touching the surface of the table that you're on. I don't know,
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:41.120]  it certainly doesn't make me want to put a case on it. I'm not worried about to ask you that
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:45.440]  because in the iPod touch and I'm holding it right now, the ring goes a little bit further than the
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:50.480]  lens. So it does protect the lens. I didn't, I forgot to check that. I think it does. But it's,
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:54.320]  you know, it's very slight. But I do think that given that it would thus be sitting at a slight
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:26:00.800]  angle, I think it means that the, you know, on a, on a perfectly flat table, I don't think any part
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:07.440]  of the lens would actually, um, would actually touch the table. So I think if anything, it's a little
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:10.480]  bit less likely. And some people have worried about it not being flush when you put it down on
[1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.720]  its back on a table. But again, the iPod touch, there's one corner that you can push at that makes
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.960]  it move a little bit, but it's solid. It does. Yeah, it wiggles a little bit on a perfectly flat table,
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:24.000]  but it's, it doesn't bother me. I mean, in theory, do I wish it were flush? Of course, but, uh,
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:29.840]  you know, I same thing with the lines for the antenna lines, you know, people are asking about those,
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:33.840]  you know, I, I didn't even mention them in the review. What are, they're fine. I don't, I don't think
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:38.080]  that they're bad. I don't think they're good. I mean, you know, there's always some kind of
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:43.120]  concession to the antenna in every single phone. I mean, the original iPhone had a big,
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:49.680]  black plastic thing on the bottom inch of it. You know, it's, it's fine. I don't know. My wife
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:55.680]  actually thinks it looks good on the gold ones, almost like, like the way that on like a handbag or
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:27:00.800]  like a woman's jacket or something like that, the, the pattern of the panel, you know, that sometimes
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:05.440]  at the seams of a piece of clothing or something like that are meant, you know, they're stitched
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:09.520]  in a different color. You know, they look something like that. So it's like Boba Fett. It's great.
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:15.200]  Yeah. One last thing before we move away from the phones is I want to, I want to, I want to,
[1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:24.080]  hopefully this will show up on the audio. So I've got, I've got three phones in front of me right now,
[1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:32.720]  the, my five S, the six and the six plus. And I'm going to toggle the silent switch on and off,
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:36.720]  holding it up against the microphone. So I'm going to start with the iPhone five S.
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:44.000]  Could you hear that? All right. Now, here's the six.
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.120]  Could you hear that? That was much harder to hear, but I heard it much harder to hear.
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:28:01.520]  Lower, right? So the six is a much quieter vibration. Now, here's the six S. I mean, the six plus,
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:12.720]  six plus, yeah, one more. It's way louder. It's really, I'm just sitting here and I'm, I'm
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:17.680]  actually going to power this one down because I'm getting notifications and it's allowed,
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:21.120]  even sitting on my desk that I know that they're showing up in the audio for the show.
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:27.520]  It's a really loud silent switch, almost problematic show. And even, I even double checked with Apple
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:32.560]  to make sure that I didn't get a unit with, you know, that was abnormal in that regard. And I said,
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.200]  no, it is a little bit louder. It's also way stronger. It's like there's no way you can miss it.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:40.240]  I wonder if that's a concession to the idea that not as many people might pocket it,
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:44.400]  but they might put it in a bag or a purse or something. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's on purpose.
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:48.720]  Yeah, maybe that is true. I don't know, but I'm surprised more people haven't commented on it
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:53.280]  in the initial reviews because it's a real difference, especially compared to the regular six,
[1:28:53.280 --> 1:28:59.440]  which is even quieter than previous iPhones. It's almost to the point where it's like,
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:03.120]  I don't even think you'd call it silent mode. You'd call it vibrate mode because it's,
[1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:09.200]  it's not silent. In a room, I almost wonder like in a room with, you know, if there was like a meeting
[1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:14.960]  and people put their phones in front of them, you know, that it's going to be almost problematic
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:20.640]  that it, you know, bzzz. Yeah, a lot of board rooms are going to have trouble. Yeah, I don't know.
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:26.960]  Let me take one last break here and thank our last sponsor, last but not least, our good friends
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:33.040]  at Hover. Hover is the best domain name registrar in the world. I say that without hesitation.
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:37.600]  That's not their description of them. That's mine. You want to get a new domain name,
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:43.760]  go to hover.com. It's the best. And it's funny thinking about domain names because I have,
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:47.840]  you know, last few I've registered, have not been at dot com. I have very few there dot com.
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:52.320]  And I've always thought, hey, dot com is all used up. There's no way you're going to get anything
[1:29:52.320 --> 1:29:57.520]  on dot com. You got to go to some kind of new top level domain. And then our new friend Jason Snell
[1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:03.840]  just registered six colors dot com. Still good names available, even at dot com.
[1:30:04.640 --> 1:30:08.960]  Still good names, especially if you put two words together. Great name for a new site,
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:15.280]  six colors dot com. Whatever you want to do, you know, go to hover. They'll help you search.
[1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:21.440]  They'll help you find awesome domain names that are still available. They have all the big top
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:30.080]  level domains, a whole bunch of all these crazy new ones like dot guru and dot club and dot coffee.
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:36.560]  They've got me. I mean, you name it. They've got it. You can go there and do it.
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:43.680]  And it's no hassle, no spam, no junk, no trying to upsell you on things that aren't even related
[1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:51.200]  to domain names, really good user interface for managing it. And the most amazing thing at all,
[1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:58.880]  unique in the whole industry is their free valet transfer service. So if you've got domains registered
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:05.520]  since the 90s at three or four different registrars all over the internet, or even if you have all
[1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:10.160]  your domains at one registrar, but it's a registrar you're not happy with, which is very,
[1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:15.760]  very likely if it's not hover. You sign up at hover, go to their free valet transfer service,
[1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:20.880]  and they will transfer you to an expert someone who does this as their full-time job.
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:26.080]  You give them your credit, you know, your information for the registrar or registrars where your
[1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:31.840]  domains already are. And they'll just go and move them all to hover and make sure all the DNS
[1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:37.040]  still works, any websites that are connected to still work, that the mail records, that everything
[1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:43.840]  just happens seamlessly, and that all these little finicky details managing the time to live,
[1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:48.320]  and all this stuff, you don't have to worry about any of it. Just let hover take care of it,
[1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:53.520]  and then all of a sudden they'll all be moved over and everything will be better because hover is
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:32:00.960]  better. Some registrars even purposefully make it hard to move your domain names away from them.
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:04.960]  Hover knows all their tricks. They'll help get around them. They know all the tricks,
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:08.560]  and they'll do it. Things that you wouldn't even think to know, they know how to do it.
[1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:12.800]  And it's free. It's free. You don't have to pay extra. It's not like, well, all right,
[1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:16.720]  you sign up for the hover in a reasonable price, but then if you want to use this valet service,
[1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:21.520]  you have to pay a couple hundred bucks or something. No, free. It's free. And they do it because
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:25.600]  that's how confident they are that once you sign up for a hover, you're going to be a customer
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:33.200]  for life. All sorts of new things. They have volume discounts on domain renewals. So if you have
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:38.480]  more, a lot of domains, you can get a volume discount with just 10, 10 domains at a time,
[1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:45.840]  review them, renew them all in bulk, and you'll save money. You can get your own custom email,
[1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:53.440]  all sorts of great stuff. Cannot recommend them highly enough. Anybody who's not using them should,
[1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:58.560]  if you have a new name for a new idea for a domain name, go sign up for them and start,
[1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:03.200]  here's what you can do. You get 10% off your first purchase in addition to all the great stuff.
[1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:08.720]  Honestly, you don't even need a discount to switch to hover, but you'll get 10% off if when you go
[1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:15.840]  to hover.com and you make a purchase, type the promo code for this show, which in the current
[1:33:15.840 --> 1:33:24.560]  campaign is the word chowder, C-H-O-W-D-E-R, as in a in joke reference to claim chowder, go to hover.com,
[1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:30.800]  sign up and you'll save 10% on your first purchase using the code word promo code, I guess,
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:37.360]  not really a code word, chowder. So my thanks to hover. Awesome, awesome domain name register
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:41.600]  and long time friend of the show. Man, we still have Iowa's eight to talk about.
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:46.240]  I say skip the rest of the van, I'll cover that on future shows. Seriously, we just don't have time.
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:51.680]  Before we get to Iowa's eight though, I guess we could talk about Apple Pay and I'm wondering
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:57.280]  what you think about that. It's really interesting because I have NFC everywhere around me,
[1:33:57.280 --> 1:34:02.400]  Sears takes it, McDonald's takes it, the gas stations take it, it's just everywhere.
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:08.640]  So I have both my credit cards have little NFC sticker on them, it's like the printing on them,
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:15.600]  and you go up and you tap the gas pump, you tap the cash register and it just works and it's great.
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:19.920]  And the idea of having that on my iPhone so I don't, my only concern with it is if I ever drop
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:24.080]  my card, you know, someone can pick it up and go start tapping for gas or tapping for food and
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.320]  it'll take a while before I realize it. So having it on my phone is hugely appealing because I
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:31.920]  don't have to carry those credit cards with me, I don't have to worry about dropping them.
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:35.840]  And because they're doing it in such a secure way where they're encrypting everything, they're
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:42.560]  putting it on the secure element and they're doing this one-time credit card number, it's even
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:46.400]  better than the convenience that I already have with NFC, so I'm really excited.
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:51.280]  Yeah, I think it's one of those cases where what Apple said is exactly the truth and there's no
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:55.360]  reason to be cynical about it, but Tim Cook's explanation that, look, everybody's tried to do this
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:58.800]  before and they've all fallen short and the reason they fall in short is that they've come up with
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:03.840]  schemes that are built around their own self-interest. In other words, I think because they want to
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:10.080]  make a lot of money on it. Rather than approaching it as let's look at it from the perspective of
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:14.960]  the customer and just make their experience better and let the fall out come after that.
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:19.280]  They're going to make money on this. There's no doubt that Apple, this isn't saying that Apple's
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:23.040]  doing it for free and all the money is passing through without them getting, but they're not making
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:29.120]  a lot per transaction. They're taking a tiny little sliver of the transactions and they're not
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:35.360]  asking retailers to install an Apple back-end system. They're not asking retailers to install
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:42.720]  Apple's proprietary iPhone only. I think at the register, it's an industry standard. It's already
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:48.480]  in hundreds of thousands of locations. They're just making it work easier than anybody else has.
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:55.120]  And it's really just, I think primarily, just about making it another way that it's nicer to own
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:00.560]  an iPhone than it is to own any other phone. That's the main advantage to Apple. It's not about
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:05.920]  the fraction of a penny per transaction that they're going to make. Although they'll keep that money.
[1:36:07.120 --> 1:36:14.800]  I think it's primarily a way to just, why do they sweat over the details of putting in a higher
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:21.040]  400 pixel per inch display in the iPhone 6? Because it's nicer for customers. I think that's what
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:26.560]  Apple Pay is all about. And I therefore think, and I meanness, I don't think, you know, I think
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:31.920]  there's some people who are going to roll their eyes, but I think it's win, win, win. It's good for
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:38.800]  Apple because they will make some money on this. And it will make iPhones a little bit stickier
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:42.400]  as something that people, once they have it, they're going to want to keep buying them.
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:47.920]  I think it's good for customers because I think it's an amazing experience. And we got the play with
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:56.560]  it. They had play register set up at the hands-on area. If anything, their demo video in the
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:03.600]  keynote undersold, how easy it is. It's really, really convenient. And then it's good for the
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:08.640]  retailers. Apple isn't charging them some kind of crazy 70-30 split. They're not asking for an
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:14.320]  exorbitant amount of money. They did get preferential treatment in terms of getting the rate that
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:20.000]  was there for when the card present rate, as opposed to the card not present rate. But I think
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:25.120]  that's fair and reasonable that they're saying, hey, touch ID combined with the security measures
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:31.120]  we've taken is the equivalent of card present. It's just a little bit more likely that this is
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:36.640]  not a fraudulent transaction. That they're not getting charged the rate that gets charged when you
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:41.120]  just read your credit card number to somebody over the phone, which is where you don't get card
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:45.600]  present because they don't see that you have the card. It reminds me of that piece you wrote
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:50.560]  after WWDC called Only Apple because if you think back to when Google tried to do this,
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:54.720]  it's almost like when they tried to do TV is that they didn't get buy and they couldn't get
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:58.400]  things past carriers. Some carriers blocked. Some carriers wanted to use their own because they have
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:02.640]  their own used to be called ISIS. I forget what they renamed it. Their own solution for these things.
[1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:07.680]  And they just couldn't get it deployed in Apple because they make everything from the chip to
[1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:13.440]  the secure enclave and the secure, I forget what the name for it is, secure element all the way
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:17.840]  up to the OS and to the hardware. It's better than having the credit card present because again,
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:21.520]  I can just drop my NFC card and someone else can pick it up and go tap things. There's no
[1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:28.400]  password. There's nothing required. This needs my pass code or my fingerprint. I heard a rumor
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.520]  that it was after Target and after a lot of the credit card breaches that the industry started
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.840]  listening to Apple, they weren't as receptive beforehand. And I think it's really telling that they
[1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:42.720]  had launch partners like they demoed the target app and the Apple Store app. And it's not just
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:47.120]  this thing that you can use in registers. They, because again, only Apple, they have the app, they
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:52.240]  made a solution that works on the phone in physical real world stores that works online with apps
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:57.760]  and that works based on a physical skin connection with the watch. And that that isn't very robust
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:06.880]  solution. Yeah, it's very, very true. And you know, like I said, when when the retailers are happy
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:11.520]  to use it, the banks are happy to use it because they're so, they seem so confident that, you know,
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:19.440]  what Apple's come up with is going to increase security and fraud is such a huge time and cost
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:28.400]  and PR sync for the banks and for retailers, right? I mean, you know, the target CEO lost his job
[1:39:28.400 --> 1:39:33.680]  over the debacle that that happened to them last year. It's a real problem. This seems like,
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:40.560]  you know, if it works as advertised is a completely credible solution. And it was so it really is,
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:46.320]  it's better for every party involved. Nobody's paying any sort of, there's no trade off for anybody.
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:54.240]  As opposed to something like, let's just compare it to the 7030 split for on-device content
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:40:01.280]  that sold on on the phones. I think that's, you know, there's a, you know, years-long argument
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:05.840]  that, hey, that's too much, you know, that Barnes & Noble shouldn't have to spend, you know,
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:12.000]  or can't, you know, afford 30% margins because they're paying, you know, they're paying the same agency
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:18.160]  model for books that anybody else is, you know, should Amazon let the Kindle, you know, use
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:23.280]  in-app purchases? No, why don't they, you know, there's all sorts of arguments to be made there
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:28.240]  where the 7030 split, depending on your perspective, may not be any interest of whoever's selling
[1:40:28.240 --> 1:40:34.720]  the goods. There's no downside like that with Apple Pay. It's really is better for everybody.
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.640]  And there was some confusion because some people thought that the 7030 split would be,
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:43.200]  for example, if Amazon, like the Amazon app used it, not the one for the Kindle store,
[1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:46.880]  but for the actual buying goods, but the 7030 was never for physical goods. It was always for
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:51.360]  the digital distribution goods within apps. So they're fine. Any target everyone can adopt this
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:57.680]  and all they're doing is the Apple Pay. Yeah. So last segment, and I want to keep it short,
[1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.160]  because I don't want to just regurgitate your excellent, excellent iOS 8 review, which anybody
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:07.440]  who's listening to the show if you haven't put it in the show notes, but go read it. It is long,
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:12.960]  it is 20,000 words. It is booklet length, but it is worth it. And it's, to me, definitive.
[1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:21.440]  What are the things, the little things in iOS 8 that you think people are most likely to
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:25.920]  overlook? Like what, you know, a couple of things that people who listen to the show maybe think
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.240]  that they're tuned into what's new in iOS 8. They've seen, you know, the keynote at WWDC,
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:36.400]  but that are like, oh, I didn't know about that. I mean, I think there's two. One is really big,
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:41.040]  and some are really small. The really big thing is because there's names like extensibility,
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.160]  and there's all sorts of different things like widgets and action, custom actions, custom keyboards,
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:51.200]  custom sharing items. But when you come down to it, the huge transformation for me with between
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:57.600]  iOS 7 and iOS 8 is that entirely reverse the before everything was pull. If you wanted to do something,
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:01.520]  you had to leave what you were doing, go to another app. For example, just sending a voice memo,
[1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:06.000]  you had to leave messages, go to the voice memo app, create a voice memo, bring up the embedded
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.560]  message sheet, and then use that to send it through messages, then go back to messages and continue
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:15.600]  your conversation. And it's like, it was like that for so many things. If you wanted to share
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:21.040]  a URL in a non-integrated app like Google+, you'd have to go to the web, copy the URL,
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:25.600]  one password, you have to launch one password, copy the password, come out. And now everything,
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:30.800]  the model is so much more towards push data where from interactive notifications, you can keep
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:36.400]  playing your game, keep watching your movie, quickly answer a message. You pull down notification
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:41.200]  center, the widgets right there. The Android model was always old-century to me because you had to
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:45.040]  leave, go to the home screen, page through the home screen, find the widget. It really didn't save
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:50.800]  you that much time. Being a notification center saves you so much time. Storehouse, now you don't
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:56.160]  have to go to storehouse and then open up the image picker and choose images. You can be in photos,
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:01.680]  you can use filters in there, you can use the sharing options. So many aspects of iOS,
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:07.440]  now bring the stuff to you where you are. And that is such a fundamental change to how I'm using
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:12.960]  my iPhone. And I think Federico did a great job explaining that too, that it's, I don't want to call
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:17.840]  it revolutionary because I think that's overused. But just the change in workflow is made it less
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:23.040]  of a choice, made it much more, much, it's made the device work for me much more than it ever has
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:35.280]  before. Yeah, it almost, it's like the way that to me that they broke down the Unix,
[1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:44.000]  you know, we're talking 40-year-old Unix multitasking model to a lower level with the original iPhone
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:53.840]  in 2007, which was, you know, panned far and wide by people for not supporting multitasking,
[1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:03.520]  which was held up by the ignorant as sort of, you know, like it's sort of a baby OS that can't do
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:08.480]  multitasking. Whereas anybody with any sort of clue would realize, well, they started with
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:17.120]  Mac OS 10, which was Unix, they took multitasking out, right? This isn't like Mac OS was back in the
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:22.320]  90s or palm OS or something like that, where there was a non multitasking operating system that
[1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:27.520]  grew to a point where they had to add it or glom it on. But that original demo with Steve Jobs,
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:31.360]  when he showed playing music, the phone rang, the music faded away, he answered the phone,
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:35.840]  he went into the web, he went to email, he went, that blew people's minds who knew multitasking
[1:44:35.840 --> 1:44:40.880]  at the time. Right, and there were things that did multitask, but there were a lot of others that
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.320]  didn't and then, you know, you hit the home button and the app would exit and, you know, when you
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:51.680]  relaunched it, it would start all over again. That was all based on the constraints that incredible
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:58.000]  constraints of the device with limited RAM and then limited, you know, a CPU that's 85 times less
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  powerful than the one we have in iPhone 6. But it was also, you know, not just those technical
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:09.280]  constraints, but I think it was a reimagining of the user experience of a personal computer that
[1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:14.800]  could, you'd want to do things like respond to a text message while you're watching a video.
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:25.520]  And that they've built it back up with XPC in a way that really makes a ton of sense and you
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.160]  don't even have to think about it too much from a user's perspective, right? It's just there,
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:34.560]  just here's a notification from Renee asking what time the show is going to start tonight,
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:38.240]  and I'm watching a Yankees game. You just pull it down a little bit and respond right there,
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:46.240]  and I didn't have to interrupt the video stream. But at the same time, solve so many problems
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:53.200]  from a typical user's perspective of what can happen with the traditional multitasking,
[1:45:53.200 --> 1:46:00.080]  where everything just gets to run and runs forever of Unix, where, you know, your whole thing
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:05.760]  can get slowed down because everything's running in the background unchecked. And not even to
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:11.360]  mention the security and privacy issues. It's incredibly, or, you know, the same thing,
[1:46:11.360 --> 1:46:14.080]  you're on a website and you want to quickly check the score. You can just pull down
[1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:18.000]  notification center and the score is in there, and you just put it back up, you go right back
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.360]  to where you're doing, which is a change. The multitasking was great. You could
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:25.360]  tap a notification, you go right to the app, but then to get back to where you were, you'd have to
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:29.120]  leave that app, double tap, if you remember to do that, go back to the fast app picker,
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:33.680]  take the app you had, or if you want to switch another app, it was just, it was not ideal.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:37.680]  And the other advantage too, like the security, the privacy, that's enormous because if you're
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:41.760]  answering a message in the Facebook app, Facebook has no idea what you're typing in that is
[1:46:41.760 --> 1:46:47.120]  completely separate. But if, for example, if you have a Facebook notification in another app,
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.840]  and Facebook is being a memory hog and Jetsome gets rid of it, that notification is completely
[1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:55.040]  independent. You'll still be typing your message or answering your notification,
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.000]  you'll never even notice what's happening with the container app in the background,
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:03.920]  and that's a huge reliability boon. Yeah, maybe the best layman's turn way to think
[1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:09.600]  about extensions and these things is that there really are like mini apps that run in their own
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:14.640]  little mini sandbox. Yeah, and it takes an explicit user action to punch through that,
[1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:20.080]  which is a great way of doing it. Yeah, yeah. What else? Anything else that's sort of like
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:26.320]  easily overlooked? Wow, I can't believe that sort of, you know, I can't, I didn't know about that.
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:30.640]  There's a lot of really nice things. For example, if you're in Safari and you go to iCloud
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:36.560]  tabs, you can get, you can close iCloud tabs on other devices from the device that you're using,
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:40.480]  which is. I did not know that scene. Now that's why I had you on the show.
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:44.800]  It's that is a feature I've wanted ever since they invented iCloud tab. I mean, there's so many
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:48.400]  things are filling in. I also love that you can go to the settings and go to the settings for
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:53.280]  any app and you go into them and there's a tab for notifications there and a tab for privacy there.
[1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:57.280]  You know, maybe I don't, I don't know how to find that and they made it easy for developers to
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:01.280]  get to that, but I just go there and I can see what this has permission for and I can turn
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:06.240]  the monitor and them off. Explain to me, because this here's something I'm confused about,
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:11.600]  explain to me user versus remote notifications, which is a new distinction that didn't exist
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:16.800]  before and now it does. So I mean, I'm not a developer. So you know, I need to like a Brent Simmons
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:21.920]  type explanation for this, but my understanding is right now you're automatically opted into the
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:26.480]  the remote notifications and what that does is things like background refresh. So a developer
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:32.560]  can send a silent notification in essence to tell your app that there's new content to download,
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:36.880]  or there's a new messages or a new timeline to pull in and it'll just go and do that in the
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:41.120]  background and you're automatically opted into that. You can choose to go and opt out of it,
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.680]  but they just want that to work. They don't want any confusion and that is now separate from
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:50.720]  the user facing notifications like a message notification or a reminder or an invitation or
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:57.360]  something. Third party keyboards, have you tried any of them? Yeah, I've tried several of them.
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:03.840]  They work in the same way. You download an app. The only problem with the third party
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:08.240]  keyboards is that they're not as easy to install. When you download a widget, for example,
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:12.000]  you pull down notification center. It tells you there's a new widget. You tap the edit button,
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.680]  you can add it right there. The keyboards, they don't tell you there's a new keyboard. So you
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:19.440]  can download it. You go to the key, you pull up the keyboard. There's no indicator that says
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.880]  there's a new keyboard available. They have to either tell you in the app where you have to know
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:27.920]  it. Go to settings, keyboards, add third party keyboard, and then enable it. Also, because the
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.480]  container apps are so small, if you have a really hefty keyboard with a lot of predictive text
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:37.440]  engines or something, that has to stay in the container app. You have to grant it access. There's
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:42.080]  a grantful access button on the keyboards. It has to be able to talk back and forth with its app
[1:49:42.080 --> 1:49:46.080]  to do a lot of the higher level stuff. Yeah, it doesn't, I have to say, that doesn't seem appealing
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:50.240]  to me at all. It's a little buggy as well because it'll sometimes it'll revert to the wrong
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:54.640]  keyboard. So it's not, it's not perfect yet, but it's this is extensibility at six
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:59.760]  extensibility is 0.9. A virgin on 1.0 is just so much stuff and it's such a fundamental change
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:03.680]  that I can't even imagine how many bugs they're squashing even as it's shipping.
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:09.200]  What you take on quick type, quick type is the new predictive text thing where it shows a couple
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.440]  of words above the keyboard. It takes like an extra row of keys above the keyboard,
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:18.640]  instead of just showing you one suggestion in line where you're typing. I still have to,
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:22.800]  like, I've been using it since I installed it the first day, WWDC. I think you laughed at me
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:28.080]  when I saw you at the bar earlier. But I like that. I like to see where it is almost immediately
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:32.320]  in force myself to use it. And I still don't remember to use it because I'm so used to typing
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:37.920]  the traditional way on an iPhone. Yeah. Yep. That's exactly me. I almost don't have an opinion on it
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.680]  because I don't even look at it because I just typed the way I've always typed and my habits are
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:46.720]  so ingrained. There's two changes to iOS that makes me feel old in a way. And one is that there's
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:51.200]  so many people, especially who use non iOS devices, who are used to Swift, Key or Swipe,
[1:50:51.200 --> 1:50:56.560]  and they really wanted it. And Apple's keyboard was outdated in that regard. But also, you take
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:51:00.320]  something like iMessage. And you know, as much as we, you know, you or me or Guy, my T's,
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:05.600]  Ben Thompson about using line and using like having whole conversations and stickers,
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:09.360]  there's a whole generation of people who instant messaging is really instant. Like you touch
[1:51:09.360 --> 1:51:13.600]  something and it goes and it makes me so nervous because Apple's doing that now. And for
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:16.880]  arbitrary text strings, they can't do that because they don't know when you're finished typing. But
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:22.640]  if you hit like location in the message thing, it just goes. If you hit, if you use that new
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:27.120]  radial interface to make a voice message, just slide up, it doesn't populate the field and then
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:31.680]  let you hit send like, you know, someone afraid like I would do. It just goes. So the instance
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:36.800]  becomes so fast. It does that with the images too and you send an attachment. You pick the image
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:41.520]  and say use this image and then it just sends the message. It doesn't sit there in the text field
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:46.160]  as a message waiting for you to hit a send, send, send button. And it's also ephemeral now,
[1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:52.000]  almost like like Snapchat where it'll, by default, it'll expire in two minutes unless you say
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.320]  keep it. And then it'll tell the other person your message has been kept or they've stopped
[1:51:56.320 --> 1:52:00.160]  doing it there. They're being very transparent in what's being done and where and I think that's
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:05.200]  good. Yeah, I'm curious to see how sound bites play out because I have, I've had it on a beta
[1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:08.400]  phone all summer, but I haven't really had a chance to use it because the sound bites don't
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:13.920]  really work unless everybody's on iOS 8. If you send one to somebody who's still on iOS 7 or
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:18.960]  another device, they just get like a audio file attachment, which they can click and play,
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:25.440]  but it's, it sounds like you're giving them a shit sandwich, you know, you're giving them a word,
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:31.200]  a doc file instead of just typing out your email. But with everybody on iOS 8, if you're,
[1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:34.960]  you know, your correspondent is on iOS 8, then they can play it just, it can just play it by
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:38.480]  lifting the phone to their ear. Yeah, it's great on the lock screen too. I, Clayton and I were
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:42.000]  playing with this a little while ago, he sent a message and it shows up and it says lift to
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.440]  listen. So you pull it up and you listen to the message and then you can record another message
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:48.960]  and you put it down and it sends it in. And it becomes almost like a walkie-talkie, just
[1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:57.360]  slinging these sound bites back and forth. Yeah. The one last thing for a wrap up is an end,
[1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:05.360]  um, the fast contacts didn't make sense to me at, uh, I at WWDC. This is now when you go into
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:12.160]  multitasking, you double tap home and above your multitasking windows, there's a row of your recent
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:18.400]  recipients are contacts, uh, just seemed weird to me like they were just shoving something into empty
[1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:22.960]  space. All of a sudden it makes a little bit more sense to me with that communication button on the
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:29.040]  Apple watch because it's the same thing. It's like we're going to make it really easy to just
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:35.360]  sort of very quickly, no matter what you're currently doing, um, somehow communicate with the
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:41.360]  people who you communicate with most frequently. Both iOS 8 and the watch seem to be a concerted
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:48.480]  effort to make logging authentication, uh, remote control and communications really work well
[1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:52.640]  and work quickly. There was in the earlier versions of those contacts were there all the time and
[1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:56.240]  I thought, you know, maybe that's not good for privacy. If you didn't want everyone glancing at
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:00.160]  who you were talking to, especially if you had complicated relationships, you can hide those now.
[1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:04.240]  But if, if you're fine with that, you have both your favorites and your reasons and you tap those
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:09.360]  and you can instantly FaceTime them, call them, message them. It's, once you get used to it, it's
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:14.160]  super quick. We're running up against two hour mark. We could go on for another two hours, um,
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:20.400]  but that's why they make next week's show, uh, Renee Ritchie at imore.com. Um,
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:25.680]  we want to shout out some of your podcasts. Uh, sure. I do a podcast called debug with guy
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:30.320]  English. I do one called iterate with mark, um, Edwards and Seth Clifford and with, uh,
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:35.680]  our mutual friend Dave Whiskis and guy. I do, um, vector and review too many damn shows.
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:39.040]  Can you remember that? Yeah. I wasn't going to let you list them all because I stopped myself.
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:45.040]  Uh, but you can go ahead. Uh, nope. Those are all good friends and those are all good shows.
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:50.880]  You're, you're, it, I feel like back to back having snow and then you, I've got the two hardest
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:58.560]  working podcasters who still managed to write thousands of words a week, uh, uh, uh, back to back
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:03.280]  shows. So I, I got to have somebody lazy on next week. I'm so happy about, uh, Jason and his new
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:07.360]  site six colors and his new podcast, uh, upgrade is because he's making a lot of content again and
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:11.760]  I love the content that he makes. Yeah. There's just so much, it's so, so funny because summer can be
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:17.840]  so slow and then all of a sudden so much happens and it's like, uh, uh, the whole mac world thing
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:22.560]  and the snow thing we could go on forever. Uh, never even brought up the whole stupid markdown thing
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  from two weeks ago. Never even mentioned it. Uh, uh, well, you and I hardly have even broached
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:33.280]  the, the watch, uh, it's, you know, it's too much. There's so much to talk about the next,
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:36.160]  you know, by the time we're done talking about it, we'll be out there for the next event,
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:42.480]  October. Anyway, Renee, thank you so much. Um, um, uh, talk to you soon.
