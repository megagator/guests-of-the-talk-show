[00:00.000 --> 00:05.760]  I am happy to report I'm healthy as a horse. I had my had my annual had my annual physical today.
[00:05.760 --> 00:10.320]  They don't call them physicals anymore. You know, they call them a wellness exam.
[00:10.320 --> 00:14.640]  Yeah, that's because the ACA because the ACA will pay for wellness exams.
[00:14.640 --> 00:17.360]  Is that really true? I honest Yeah. And so it's
[00:18.320 --> 00:21.920]  it's required. But the question is, how often can you go in for a wellness exam? Are you well once
[00:21.920 --> 00:26.560]  a year? Or do you need to go in multiple times? I found this out. We had a terrible health plan
[00:26.560 --> 00:32.080]  last year. And I went in to see the doctor and I skipped I called and said, I'm scheduling this as
[00:32.080 --> 00:35.840]  a wellness visit. And they said great. And I saw the doctor and I said, we have a terrible
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.480]  insurance plan. This has to be a wellness visit. He said, Oh, I totally understand. Absolutely.
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.200]  Then I got a bill for like $300 because we had a terrible plan last year. And I called, you know,
[00:45.200 --> 00:51.760]  sent it through Kaiser, which is both the insurer and the health plan provider, right? The health
[00:51.760 --> 00:56.720]  provider. And I wrote them and said, this was a wellness visit. And they wrote back and said,
[00:56.720 --> 01:03.600]  Well, you're responsible for any services incurred during a visit, no matter what. And I said,
[01:04.640 --> 01:10.080]  but the doctor even told me was about this visit. I wound up having to make a stink. I wrote letters
[01:10.080 --> 01:16.080]  to Kaiser, they wound up eventually assigning a fixer to me at Kaiser. And this person addressed
[01:16.080 --> 01:22.080]  all of my wife and my issues because we kept having issues. A nurse made my wife cry on the
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.720]  phone, which is rare. My wife is very level headed because her wife called and the nurse
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.560]  said you have such a terrible health plan. It's awful. You should be ashamed of yourself for
[01:32.560 --> 01:36.720]  having such a plan. She's like, it's what we can afford. And they're like, okay, that probably
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.640]  shouldn't happen. Like, yep. Like, we're gonna have that nursing for retraining. I'm like, look,
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.040]  I don't want to get in any trouble. But really, the nurse is probably frustrated also. But like,
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.640]  that's the state of health care is your nurses yelling at people for terrible health plans.
[01:51.200 --> 01:56.320]  I was in. I'm knocking out all my doctor's appointments this week. And next. I went to
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.760]  the eye doctor two days ago, I went to my my general practitioner today. And the next week,
[02:01.760 --> 02:06.160]  I'm going to the dentist. So I'm doing it all. I'm taking care of myself. Your eyes. Didn't you
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.880]  have an eye problem? Oh, I have terrible eye problems. But it's a mixed bag. It's you know,
[02:10.880 --> 02:17.040]  it is. Andy Bayo's terrible eye problem, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I forget what the details were.
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.880]  It was just like a tiny, tiny, tiny something got embedded in his eye. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it
[02:22.880 --> 02:27.840]  wound up being this multi like a year long odyssey. And I think he's fine. Now. I believe
[02:27.840 --> 02:32.320]  he's on the other side of it. But it's just one of those things. I have friends who their kid
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.560]  had a fishbone in their throat. And they didn't know what was going on. And no doctor could
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.760]  diagnose it until the kid was old enough to articulate exactly what was going on. Geez.
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.160]  And when they could say, Oh, my throat hurts right here. They were able to find it with
[02:48.160 --> 02:52.880]  an endoscope and take it out. And then they were fine. You're like, Oh, my God. Yeah. But I did
[02:52.880 --> 02:58.400]  hear a funny story. Well, funny, funny, funny to our friends in Europe and Canada and elsewhere.
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.680]  And and oh, yeah, that makes sense here in the United States is my ophthalmologist is at the
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.680]  the Wills Eye Hospital here in Philadelphia to seriously a world leading eye hospital.
[03:10.480 --> 03:13.920]  It's a hospital just for the eye. That's where I had my retinal surgery.
[03:14.960 --> 03:22.880]  Four years ago. But anyway, their emergency room, their hospital is on the east side of
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.280]  Oh, Jesus at eighth street or ninth street. I'm gonna say ninth street here in Philadelphia,
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.360]  like corner ninth and walnut. They're on the east side. But they're like at the eighth floor and
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.520]  up. I don't know what's on the first seven floors. But their emergency room, the Wills Eye emergency
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.760]  room is on the west side of the street and an older building that used to be the entire Wills
[03:39.760 --> 03:45.600]  Eye Hospital. Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen who goes to my eye doctor came in, and he has one good eye.
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.160]  He was actually in it. I mean, this is probably a HIPAA violation that she's telling me the story,
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.920]  but she's a doctor. She tells stories. He's got one good identifying information. I think it's
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.600]  okay. He's got one. He's got one good eye. And he's he was taking some chairs out of the trunk
[04:03.600 --> 04:10.480]  of his car. And well, the leg of the one chair poked his good eye out. Jesus. No. So he goes
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.600]  Louis Braille. It's like, do you ever believe the story that Louis Braille was playing with an all
[04:15.600 --> 04:19.120]  and poked his eye out as a child? I don't believe that. I don't know either. But this guy poked his
[04:19.120 --> 04:23.120]  eye out with his good eye with the leg of a chair. So he does the right thing. He goes to the Wills
[04:23.120 --> 04:31.120]  Eye emergency room. And I'm not quite sure how what what level of in or out his good I was at
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.560]  the time. I mean, I'll say this so that nobody is distressed. It's all good. He's a you know,
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.040]  they got his eye back in and they did some surgery and he's his good eye is still as good as he's
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.840]  good. But in the meantime, he's in the emergency room. And I believe that when your eyes only
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.880]  partially in in the socket, they quickly diagnose this one as you know, a genuine eye emergency and
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.280]  they said you need surgery. Now the surgery is going to take place across the street. But in the
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.240]  meantime, for whatever reason, in the emergency room, they'd already hooked him up to an IV.
[05:01.280 --> 05:04.880]  So he's already got the IV there. This is how certain they were that you're going to need
[05:04.880 --> 05:11.680]  surgery, they will get you the IV now. But then he's literally across Ninth Street in Center City,
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.440]  Philadelphia from the hospital where he needs to have the surgery. So they can't just have them
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.680]  cross the street with an IV. So they put them in an ambulance just to go. Oh, my God. Yeah,
[05:19.680 --> 05:29.040]  of course. Right. $3,000 to go across the street. Yeah. Oh, my God. This is I had cancer over 20
[05:29.040 --> 05:33.520]  years ago. And I had chemotherapy. And at some point, they're giving me some drug and they're
[05:33.520 --> 05:39.680]  like, if you need to go to the bathroom to tell us because you're a biohazard. So if you need to
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.840]  wheel this down the hall, we have to do like this protocol. It's like, okay, that's kind of scary.
[05:45.840 --> 05:51.040]  Sure. I think it got taken care of. I think at some point, somebody talked to me, you know,
[05:51.040 --> 05:54.320]  talk to this insurance company and said, you cannot, you cannot stick this gentleman with
[05:54.320 --> 05:58.480]  this bill for this. We insisted upon this, you know, he had no option, you know, we'd already,
[05:58.480 --> 06:03.520]  you know, and I guess so I, you know, it was all good. His eyes. Okay, now, and it's back,
[06:03.520 --> 06:08.720]  back in his head. Oh, my God. And but he initially got a bill for the hospital for the ambulance,
[06:08.720 --> 06:14.640]  right? It was $3,000. And when I say across the street, I mean, like, it just across the street,
[06:14.640 --> 06:20.560]  like you could kick a kick a pebble as far as it needed to go. Yeah, yeah, it's tricky. My in-laws
[06:20.560 --> 06:23.440]  have had to go to the ER recently, and they're fine. But there are things where you have to go
[06:23.440 --> 06:30.400]  to the ER. My mother in law broke her wrist unintentionally, she fell over. And she went
[06:30.400 --> 06:34.400]  late enough today, she they're in a relatively small town nearby. We've just they've just moved
[06:34.400 --> 06:39.280]  closer to us, like three blocks from every hospital in Seattle, which is great. It'll help in
[06:39.280 --> 06:43.680]  the future. But they're like, okay, how do we get home? And they're like, no cabulances, no taxis
[06:43.680 --> 06:49.760]  would take them. They had to get an ambulance to take them home. And it was so far away. My wife
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.520]  can't drive at night now. And so we would have to drive a half an hour leave the kids home alone in
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.680]  the middle of the night. So they took an ambulance home was the only way they could get back to their
[07:00.320 --> 07:07.280]  retirement place, which is wild. That's crazy. The good news is my eyes, my eyesight. I have very
[07:07.280 --> 07:13.920]  good eyesight for an 82 year old man. That's I got the lungs of a 70 year old and he wants them back.
[07:13.920 --> 07:20.400]  But my lung capacity apparently is not very good either. Because they do this. They do this test.
[07:20.400 --> 07:24.960]  I don't know if they do this where you go, but they give you this lung capacity test,
[07:24.960 --> 07:30.480]  you got to take it's like a plastic thing, sort of like a mometer spygo. And you got to like,
[07:30.480 --> 07:34.480]  you got to take a deep breath, and then you blow as much air into it as you can. And then you suck
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.040]  as much air into it as you can. And it came up, I saw the computer, it was hooked up to it said,
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.960]  okay, or something. Yeah, no, like, this is good. But my, you know, the doctor is like,
[07:43.760 --> 07:47.120]  Have you ever smoked cigarettes? And I'm like, No, never. I've never smelled. She's like,
[07:47.120 --> 07:54.400]  Are you sure? Yeah, I had to. I was like, really serious big mode. Manometer is the name of it.
[07:54.400 --> 07:58.640]  I had, oh, no way. There's a blood pressure gauge. I'm looking at the wrong thing. It's a spyro
[07:58.640 --> 08:03.680]  spyro. Metameter. Anyway, I had the same thing. The doctors like, you know, this would be great
[08:03.680 --> 08:08.400]  if you were 70. Not so good at 50. I'm like, all right, they can do better. Like, well,
[08:09.200 --> 08:14.720]  spirometry. That's a spiral meter. It's much easier. Yeah, well, we're, you know, we're old,
[08:14.720 --> 08:19.520]  we're falling apart. No, but I got a good checkup overall. I got good cholesterol. I've got good
[08:19.520 --> 08:26.000]  liver enzymes, always a bit of a concern for me. Everything's good. You'll get an eye lung in a
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.720]  few years. Apple's focusing on health care. It'll all be set five years from now. Lung transplants.
[08:30.720 --> 08:37.360]  I'm not a Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm dropping a word. What's the word when you
[08:38.960 --> 08:45.920]  imagine you have every disease? Oh, psychosomatic? No, no, but there's it's
[08:45.920 --> 08:51.600]  a it's allophobic. No, no, it's I can't believe we're drawing a blank on this. It's a psychosomatic.
[08:51.600 --> 08:56.080]  It's a hypochondria. Hypochondria. Right, right. There's a famous Keith Richards quote,
[08:56.080 --> 08:59.840]  where he says there's only one disease I'm aware of that's deadly. And it's hypochondria.
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.040]  Oh, that's good. I'm not a hypochondriac. But I'm a hypochondriac, like within 48 hours of a
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.520]  doctor's appointment. Like, I'll go 363 days at this point, and I'll feel fine. And I won't worry
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.440]  about it. But then I'll find out on two days before my quote unquote wellness exam next year,
[09:17.440 --> 09:20.320]  and all of a sudden, I'll be like, I think I'm having a heart attack.
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.880]  Geez. The flip side is my friend Tessa Miller wrote this beautiful, beautiful essay slash
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.240]  reported piece for the New York Times a couple days ago, you probably saw it. It's called five
[09:30.240 --> 09:34.320]  things I wish I'd known before my chronic illness. I saw that I did see that. It's an amazing thing.
[09:34.320 --> 09:38.800]  She's an editor I've worked with and just a incredibly lovely human being and she has
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.520]  Crohn's disease. And she basically if health insurance changed, she would die. There's a lot
[09:43.520 --> 09:50.240]  of people in that boat, because the the drug she needs, essentially known immune suppressant style
[09:50.240 --> 09:56.160]  drug would would be unaffordable. And but she wrote this beautifully and again, in a reported
[09:56.160 --> 10:01.920]  fashion about, you know, what's it like when you're never going to get well? And she's been
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.920]  posting responses she's gotten on Instagram for people who are just so grateful that it's partly
[10:05.920 --> 10:10.960]  it's like, how do you get other people to stop being a pain and suggesting terrible ideas to
[10:10.960 --> 10:14.960]  you because you've tried everything or you know, they're suggesting things just at work or have
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.800]  no medical validity. It was beautiful story. You see the thing I linked to it a couple weeks ago
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.560]  about how vitamins are a racket. I think we talked to me talk about this on Twitter. I
[10:26.560 --> 10:31.280]  just yeah, I've been gradually taking me over the last several years, I've gradually eliminated most
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.920]  vitamins from my diet that I don't consume. So my doctor is good. And my doctor, I don't sit here
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.200]  and tell my doctor how to be a doctor. I I've chosen her to be my doctor because I think she's
[10:41.200 --> 10:49.360]  a very good doctor and and she's she's both had the medical training and years of expertise and
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.480]  has been doing it. And I trust her. I'm sure she stays up on things more than than I do. But I've
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.920]  I've gotten on this schedule where my annual I keep on to call it a physical but my wellness exam
[10:59.920 --> 11:03.840]  although if you think about it just in terms of being a language geek calling it a physical isn't
[11:03.840 --> 11:08.560]  really a good word either. And I know, you know, also the science shows that we shouldn't get annual
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.080]  checkups to check up I guess a checkup is the because we're not supposed to get them there's
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.600]  actually a good clinical Oh, why not? Can you tell me why? Yeah, because it it's unnecessary
[11:17.600 --> 11:22.960]  medical spending and the interventions are typically either feudal or unnecessary. It
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.000]  winds up more tests are ordered and more money spent without any discernible improvement in
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.080]  outcomes. So I forget what the number is. But they're like, basically, I think the clinical
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.400]  work was, you should go in when you're actually sick, or when you have something that's inexplicable,
[11:36.400 --> 11:42.000]  and maybe every several years, but a yearly thing is actually just, it's almost a revenue enhancer
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  that's become so codified, we expect it. So if someone said to you, it's like with breast,
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.320]  my mammograms, those are now seen as the research shows that women should not be getting them
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.800]  annually above certain age, it doesn't right at below a certain age, because it doesn't increase
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.640]  the outcome statistically. Now, individually, if you go in, they say yes, you have breast cancer,
[12:02.640 --> 12:06.320]  and it's operable. And that's great. But statistically, it actually exposes women
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.960]  to more radiation that's necessary, and probably increases the amount of unnecessary intervention.
[12:10.960 --> 12:14.880]  So you're like, Oh, you know, how do you walk back from that anyway, but so so your so your
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.280]  annual exam probably shouldn't be an annual anyway. Yeah. Well, anyway, I've long been on
[12:19.280 --> 12:24.720]  the schedule where it's it's in mid February. And here on the East Coast, you know, we're in the
[12:24.720 --> 12:30.000]  middle of winter. And I tend to, you know, stay inside, it's cold, it's dark, there's not a lot of
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.960]  sunlight anyway. So, you know, for years, my vitamin D has shown up as low and the point and
[12:34.960 --> 12:38.000]  I'll tell you what, by the way, Glenn, I mean, I'm not complaining, there's a lot worse things
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.920]  that can happen. But when you go in, you got to go in, I got to go in at least a week before
[12:41.920 --> 12:48.080]  my wellness exam, and they to get my quote, blood work done. And they couldn't be nicer even going
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.960]  to the same place. It's actually like physically connected to where my my physician is. And and
[12:53.840 --> 12:58.000]  very nice woman. So I was there a week ago. And I you know, I don't I don't like getting my blood
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.560]  drawn. I'm a little queasy about stuff like that. I gotta say it was as painless as it could be.
[13:02.560 --> 13:05.440]  It really was. But I'll tell you, they take a lot of blood.
[13:05.440 --> 13:12.560]  Oh, yeah. How many vials was it? It was it was five big ones and two small ones. And
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.520]  it's a lot of blood. I think I and I all I can think is what the hell are they doing? Why can't
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.360]  they? What are they doing? What are they doing that they need more than a drop of? Why? Why
[13:21.360 --> 13:27.040]  isn't one vial enough for all of these? Why was Theranos a fraud? Why couldn't they have been
[13:27.040 --> 13:31.760]  didn't, you know, produced an actual product? They take a lot of blood. But anyway, for years,
[13:31.760 --> 13:36.000]  it's been showing up as slightly vitamin D deficient. And so I've I swore to my doctor,
[13:36.000 --> 13:41.520]  all right, I will take these vitamin D supplements every day. And I remember to do it. I keep them
[13:41.520 --> 13:45.360]  right next to my coffee. And so I'll never forget to make coffee. And so my vitamins are right
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.160]  there. I take these vitamin D's. But I read this story. And it's very, very compelling. I think
[13:50.160 --> 13:56.320]  that that, yes, it's like a correlation, not causation thing that yes, there are, you know,
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.840]  there are people with very high levels of vitamin D tend to be healthier and have a lower risk of
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.400]  all sorts of things, you know, excluding heart problems and all sorts of things.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.880]  But the reason isn't because they're full of vitamin D. It's that they have vitamin D,
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.400]  because they go outside all the time and live active lifestyle. Yes, yes.
[14:16.080 --> 14:21.360]  Right. Like, so and that makes so much sense in the world to me. And they're like, and this over
[14:21.360 --> 14:26.720]  over fear of the sun in the United States is really bad. Like, yes, getting a sunburn is
[14:26.720 --> 14:30.960]  really bad for your skin, tanning, getting your, you know, skin as dark as it can get
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.920]  very bad for your skin. In the long run, you can get these skin cancers. But even even then,
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.920]  the type of skin cancers that you tend to get from long term overexposure to the sun are among
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.760]  the most treatable cancers that you can have. It's not it's not the worst thing in the world.
[14:45.760 --> 14:50.320]  But we've gotten to the point where there's a lot of supposedly health conscious Americans who
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.560]  literally just avoid the sun at all costs, they just don't get any sun. And that's actually very
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.720]  bad for you. Because that's where the vitamin D that's, you know, that's supposedly good for you.
[14:58.720 --> 15:05.760]  And there's no clinical proof that taking a little tiny vitamin D pill, instead of going out and
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.600]  being active in the sun actually has any of the benefits that the people who have their vitamin D
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.160]  from healthy outdoor lifestyles do. And that article you're talking about, there was one,
[15:18.160 --> 15:22.880]  I think a few months before there was more about the guy, there's like, one guy who has been such
[15:22.880 --> 15:28.400]  a vitamin D advocate, that this doctor has overwhelmed everybody else who's like, whatever.
[15:28.400 --> 15:33.680]  And he it's, it's actually almost entirely due to this one person's influence. It's not even like
[15:33.680 --> 15:39.200]  a drug industry thing, or, you know, a supplements thing. It's this one guy has had a mania about it,
[15:39.200 --> 15:44.800]  and he's wrong. Yeah, you know, he's not wrong, like he's in falsifying data. But his conclusions
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.520]  aren't actually well supported enough. And a kibosh put on this a long time ago, because,
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.640]  right, it does encourage people to take vitamin D instead of going outside. And, and yeah,
[15:54.640 --> 16:00.320]  that article was great about how, like, actually, the kinds of skin cancers people get that are most
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.080]  that are worst are either genetic, or they're caused by non sun related reasons, right? So most
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.640]  of those So, yes, you can get sunburns. And yes, we have the ozone depletion. And there are other
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.960]  things that are an issue. But spending, you know, 30 minutes in the sun or an hour in the sun
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.520]  without any sunscreen, for most people is probably a really good thing, depending on time of year and
[16:20.400 --> 16:24.800]  whatever. No, it's funny, because you wonder, you're like, you're like, if the sun was that bad,
[16:24.800 --> 16:28.880]  and pre you know, even when the ozone layer was thicker, wouldn't everyone have died of cancer in
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.440]  like 1940, they'd be covered in skin cancer, because people spent most people spent most
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.320]  their time outdoor before offices. And, and even as we became an industrialized society,
[16:38.320 --> 16:43.360]  there are still massive amounts of time. And the historical evidence as people live longer lives,
[16:43.360 --> 16:46.960]  the historical evidence isn't there that like, people are just covered in skin cancer. So,
[16:47.680 --> 16:52.720]  yeah, and I linked to that. And then I got some email from from my good readers down in Australia,
[16:52.720 --> 16:57.120]  who were in the midst of it. I'm not good with Celsius, I think it was somewhere around 50
[16:57.120 --> 17:03.120]  degrees Celsius, you know, it was like, 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In Australia, it is crazy,
[17:03.120 --> 17:07.040]  like at the limits of human endurance, right? And they're like, I'm wearing sunscreen. I'm like,
[17:07.040 --> 17:10.160]  I get it. I get it. I'm not telling them that, you know, please, please, you know,
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.440]  what's the saying like, don't, you know, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. I'm not
[17:13.440 --> 17:18.000]  saying sunscreen as a racket and not called for it. Clearly, where you are, you should,
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.760]  yeah, you should probably put a lot of the SPF 50. Like, I'm just saying, you know,
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.720]  here in the US, there's a lot of people who really have like a I'm never exposing my skin to the sun
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.120]  period, you know, and that that's probably not, that's probably actually doing harm to them not
[17:33.120 --> 17:39.520]  not. We should combine different trends and just rub peanut oil all over our faces. Just
[17:40.400 --> 17:42.480]  cook, reduce, reduce allergies.
[17:45.440 --> 17:48.720]  How are you so ends the health aspect of the show, although the other thing I should write,
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.320]  as I just saw a story today, and I know it's gonna bother you, because I know you're bothered
[17:52.320 --> 17:59.680]  by this. But I did see that the the the Russian troll farm that's been responsible for
[17:59.680 --> 18:06.560]  putting their thumbs on the scale of like US and UK elections in the last few years,
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.200]  they've, they conclusively have shown that they have helped promote the anti anti vaccination
[18:13.200 --> 18:18.480]  movement. Oh, yeah, I mean, surprise, surprise, you know, because, you know, it's like, I'm aware
[18:18.480 --> 18:24.480]  of like, the it's up by you, right? It's up in Washington state, we did. It's just an announcement
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.000]  this morning, it's going to cost them at least a million dollars minimum of a million dollars
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.800]  to deal with the measles outbreak, Washington state. Yeah, well, there's also one in Europe,
[18:32.800 --> 18:37.760]  though, which I was not as aware of. And it's the same thing where it's been, you know, this this
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.800]  whole nonsense science, you know, and it's funny, because, you know, it's like, you know, you read
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.120]  one story, and somebody says, you know, this vitamin D supplement thing, all these supplements
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.720]  are a racket. And then it's, you know, it, I could see where, you know, you got to know who to trust
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.080]  and who not to trust, you know, and, and somebody else, somebody else saying that these vaccinations
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.680]  cause more problems, and you don't need your kids don't need them. All of a sudden, it sounds like
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.760]  the same thing, like, you know, vitamin D is a racket, but vaccinations are good. Now, it's all
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.480]  you know, nonsense, but it's actually a trust big pharma. I mean, this is a recurring thing. It's
[19:10.480 --> 19:14.720]  like, I'm alive because of big pharma. Well, no, I'm alive, actually, because of the academic
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.760]  research that was taken and paid for typically by government grants that was then commercialized
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.560]  by big pharma, which is where a lot of some of the better drugs I mean, there's more recent stuff
[19:24.560 --> 19:30.320]  that has less relevance for more people, right? So like Vioxx was supposed to be a great new anti
[19:30.320 --> 19:34.240]  inflammatory turned out to have all kinds of problems that were suppressed the company faced,
[19:34.240 --> 19:39.600]  you know, the ignored warning signs. It was terrible. And so after Vioxx, how do you trust
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.720]  big pharma? No, no, it's fine. The vaccines are okay. But there's a very simple way to test
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.240]  efficacy of things is you look around the world at places in which there is no financial motivation
[19:50.240 --> 19:56.320]  for a particular thing. So there's no financial motivation for vaccination in Europe and other
[19:56.320 --> 20:01.600]  places, no profit motive. There's no government motive. So you look at 180 countries or something
[20:01.600 --> 20:06.160]  and you say, are the rates of autism different? Are the side effects different? What are the you
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.880]  know, what are the outbreaks of measles? And you can say, okay, so even if the US big pharma had
[20:10.880 --> 20:15.680]  some weird plot to vaccinate everybody, it was unnecessary. And they were disregarding problems.
[20:15.680 --> 20:19.520]  It doesn't explain why the rest of the world is doing it. And it's been efficacious. And there's
[20:19.520 --> 20:25.280]  no side effects. As opposed to there are other drug things where European or other regulators are
[20:25.280 --> 20:29.520]  like, we don't want this drug in the market, the US allows it in the market. There are these
[20:29.520 --> 20:34.560]  problems, but they're not basic things like vaccines. Yeah. And we've had, you know, we
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.880]  had a thing. I remember when Jonas was young, there was a time where he had a checkup and he
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.200]  was just the doctors wanted to give him I think three or four vaccinations. And my wife is like,
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.840]  that that's too much. How about two and we'll come back. And they're like, okay, you know,
[20:47.840 --> 20:51.760]  and I've had, you know, I post sometimes about this anti vaccination stuff. And there are some
[20:51.760 --> 20:56.720]  people who are clearly not anti vaxxers, but who bring up situations like that, which my wife and
[20:56.720 --> 21:00.880]  I agreed on, you know, we're like, you know what, how about no more than two at a time, and we'll
[21:00.880 --> 21:05.120]  come back in a month or six weeks or whatever and get the other one. Like he's had all the
[21:05.120 --> 21:10.400]  vaccinations that are recommended, just maybe didn't get four of them in one day. And and we,
[21:10.400 --> 21:15.280]  you know, I probably wouldn't have spoken up. I mean, honestly, I, you know, I say toughen the
[21:15.280 --> 21:21.280]  kid up, but my wife didn't want him stuck four times. Something like that perfectly reasonable,
[21:21.280 --> 21:26.560]  as long as your kid can still say like, at the age of eight has had all the recommended
[21:26.560 --> 21:32.880]  vaccinations. You know, yeah, yeah, it's, it's crazy. It is absolutely crazy as a child of the
[21:32.880 --> 21:41.920]  70s and early 80s. You know, like, I just grew up thinking like, wow, we live in an age of medical
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.960]  marvels. There's there's something called measles that used to affect kids. I can't get it. You
[21:46.960 --> 21:54.000]  know, polio brought down a president, I can't get it. You know, if I just did, do you ever think
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.640]  measles would come back? I honestly like it just know it's, it's terrific. But it's it's
[21:58.640 --> 22:03.280]  interesting, because this is that, not to get political, but it's the, this spans ideology.
[22:03.280 --> 22:08.400]  So it has more to do, it's not quite left, right? It is, it is definitely, you know,
[22:08.400 --> 22:14.480]  it's a rejection of empirical evidence, rejection of sort of fact, which is infected us all over
[22:14.480 --> 22:20.080]  the place, is it's in a world in which it's increasingly hard to know what is really fact
[22:20.080 --> 22:24.560]  based. I can understand why people start subscribing to a belief in like, I mean,
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.760]  Gwyneth Paltrow is a great example where a terrific actress, Goop is a group is a terrible
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.720]  thing. It's a it's a terrible influence, but in a very particular way, like she's actually,
[22:34.720 --> 22:40.240]  I think, endangering my online friend, Dr. Jen Gunter, who has a great new book out about the
[22:40.240 --> 22:44.480]  vagina that apparently people should buy. I think whether you have one or not, it's a very good book,
[22:44.480 --> 22:51.440]  apparently. Can't wait to get a copy and great cover. So she's been a leading voice, not against
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.040]  Goop, but at like, trying to demystify these things like, like, you know, why is a jade egg
[22:57.040 --> 23:02.880]  bad to insert into your body? Well, it's because the surface is essentially a porous surface and
[23:02.880 --> 23:07.440]  like, you can get an infection from it, it's not safe. So yes, people may have done it 1000 years
[23:07.440 --> 23:11.840]  ago, the jury's out on that. But like today, we understand the transmission and vector of
[23:11.840 --> 23:17.520]  illnesses, we're going to live to be on average more than 40. It's really an unhealthy thing. So
[23:17.520 --> 23:21.440]  if you need to do that, maybe there's a different kind of object that would work. But you know,
[23:21.440 --> 23:26.080]  there's just there's a rejection of, I think there's a desire to try to find something more.
[23:26.080 --> 23:30.800]  And sometimes that leads people into magical thinking. And I think with vaccines, the fact that
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.440]  they've been so effective, we just don't look at it as a problem. And when it's not a problem,
[23:35.440 --> 23:39.440]  you think you're being lied to when you're told it is one. Then you have an outbreak. And the
[23:39.440 --> 23:44.080]  interview people whose kids have measles is like, yeah, well, sort of I wish now the great one was
[23:44.080 --> 23:48.880]  somebody I think this is real on Twitter said, I wish there were, you know, said I didn't get my
[23:48.880 --> 23:53.360]  kids vaccines. And now they have, they may be exposed to measles. I wish there were a way to
[23:53.360 --> 24:00.240]  prevent that. Right? What is it? What is what is the best advice for protecting my kids? Yeah. Oh,
[24:00.240 --> 24:06.560]  my God, I saw that. And people were like, invent a time machine, go back and get your kids vaccinated.
[24:07.440 --> 24:12.000]  I know. And it's I want to laugh. And I want to not laugh because I, I think it's ridiculous. Like,
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.040]  I'm somebody who, you know, there's this always like this from art history, which was these
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.560]  Egyptian statues, they always show the these country, you know, the pharaohs and leaders,
[24:22.560 --> 24:26.560]  like staring directly at the sun, and there was a sun worshiping society and so forth.
[24:26.560 --> 24:30.560]  This idea of like, looking straight at the truth, it's really, really hard, like, burn your eyes
[24:30.560 --> 24:36.240]  out, but you got to do it. And I feel like there's a difficulty and just accepting what's real,
[24:36.240 --> 24:41.280]  however uncomfortable is to you. And it's very easy to believe in conspiracies, when in fact,
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.520]  conspiracies are bound to wrap madness. How do you differentiate between the Russians
[24:45.520 --> 24:52.000]  influencing the 2016 election and big pharma trying to affect children with vaccines? How
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.520]  about this? This awful, dreadful Sackler family behind the one of the opioids every day and new
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.240]  horror from them like they just didn't care, right? Not only did they not care, then they
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.160]  then they then they had the brainiac idea that maybe they could make money on the drugs people
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.000]  take to get off opioids. Yeah, it's like, you know, treatment's probably a growth business
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.400]  that we created. So perhaps we could make money there to talk about institutionalized,
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.280]  legalized corruption. Oh, my absolutely horrible. Right. And again, I, you know, I get it where it
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.800]  all kind of blurs together, and you just want to chalk it all up. But some of this is, you know,
[25:26.800 --> 25:33.440]  important and good stuff. Yeah. And it's just, it's just maddening measles. I just cannot believe
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.000]  that measles. Honest to God, I mean, you just never would have thought of this. Like, you know,
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.760]  when we were kids, you know, it's 1980. I'm a seven year old, you think what is one of the
[25:41.760 --> 25:45.360]  problems can be on your mind when you're 40 years from now when you're 40? You're a middle aged man,
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.880]  john. measles was not one of the problems, you know, I assumed we'd have eliminated all disease
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.080]  because of vaccines. Actually, the most, there's two things that are most shocking to me in 2019.
[25:56.080 --> 26:00.960]  One is that more diseases haven't been eliminated, especially ones that really, it's just a matter of
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.360]  a small amount of money. And that's something like the Gates Foundation, like river blindness,
[26:05.360 --> 26:09.840]  and things like that, like things that require so little money in relative terms with such an
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.960]  incredible personal and productivity benefit. And the other is, have you had an x ray in the last
[26:16.960 --> 26:23.840]  several years? Uh, probably, but that's like magic now. You remember how? Oh, yeah, yeah.
[26:23.840 --> 26:27.760]  10 years ago, there's still the film and whatever. I had to get one they worried I had maybe walking
[26:27.760 --> 26:31.680]  pneumonia or something the other day. So I go and there's, you know, I don't I don't but I walk in
[26:31.680 --> 26:34.880]  and the guy's like, Oh, yeah, this is great. It was chatting with the guys like, we're done. It
[26:34.880 --> 26:40.000]  was like three minutes, start to finish. And he's able to review them, examine them and send the
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.400]  file back to the doctor. By the time I left, I already got like a reading like everything's fine.
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.120]  You know, that to me is actually the most understated miracle. And it's a great, you know,
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.800]  example of all the aspects of technology that come together. Yeah, they can see inside you
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.760]  really well. Now. It's really, really amazing. And yeah, and it happens very quickly. Yeah.
[26:58.960 --> 27:04.400]  Amazing sensor technology. All right, let me take a break might as well. And thank our first
[27:04.400 --> 27:12.560]  sponsor. They've been in the news lately. So good friends at Eero. Look, Eero does Wi Fi so well.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.240]  Basic idea of the Eero system is that they create a mesh network. Basic Eero kit, I believe comes
[27:20.240 --> 27:26.720]  with a base station and two of their smaller nightlight type things. But you can get as many
[27:26.720 --> 27:30.240]  as you need you go to the website, tell them to figure out the size of your house, they'll
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.280]  recommend a kit for you that's just perfect for your home. Basic idea, you plug one of them in
[27:35.280 --> 27:39.280]  to your cable modem, wherever your internet really comes in, that's your main station.
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.720]  And then you just plug in other ones around your house, maybe have a three floor house,
[27:42.720 --> 27:49.280]  put one on every floor, and it saturates your whole home with one network. So it's not like,
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.720]  Oh, now you've got three networks and your devices have to like jump around and it everything from
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.000]  your devices perspective looks like one network. But the three devices on the Eero side work
[28:00.000 --> 28:07.280]  together to create one mesh network. It is so much better for saturating an oddly shaped house or a
[28:07.280 --> 28:13.440]  big house or a tall house with network than trying to get one base station somewhere in a central
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.680]  location. Or maybe you don't even have a choice because this is where your cable comes in. It has
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.720]  to be in this one spot at like in the one side of the house, trying to get one base station to
[28:22.720 --> 28:27.680]  saturate your whole house with a strong Wi Fi signal. mesh networks are the way to go. Eero
[28:27.680 --> 28:34.240]  is great hardware, so easy to set up. Everything goes through the Eero app, which is just a
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.840]  terrific app for iOS works on the iPhone works on the iPad. And you can use it to set up all sorts
[28:39.840 --> 28:44.160]  of things like you can set it up optionally, if you want to get a notification every time a new
[28:44.160 --> 28:50.800]  device joins the network. You can sign up for their Eero plus system, which gives you all sorts
[28:50.800 --> 28:56.720]  of stuff like ad blocking, content blocking, and ways to manage like your kids devices and stuff
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.000]  like that. All it all sounds like wow, that would be really hard. You have to be like a network
[29:02.000 --> 29:08.480]  engineer to get something like that working. Not with Eero. It is so easy and obvious to look at it
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.080]  and figure out what to do on the on the on the app. I'm speaking to you right now if you hear
[29:14.080 --> 29:20.000]  me it's because Glenn's hearing me speak over an Eero network here at during fireball world
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.720]  headquarters. It is it is truly a terrific product. I've been using it for years. And it's
[29:24.720 --> 29:29.360]  even easy when you do things like upgrade, because I got an Eero with the first generation hardware
[29:29.360 --> 29:32.720]  years ago when they first started because they sponsored the show. And then when they came out
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.360]  with their second generation hardware, which adds all sorts of I forget what it does, but it's just
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.320]  better signal. Doesn't matter. It's just better. That's what you get if you buy it now anyway.
[29:42.320 --> 29:46.080]  But I wanted to figure out how hard is it going to be to replace like my first generation
[29:46.720 --> 29:50.160]  base station with the second generation one couldn't have been easier. There's even there's
[29:50.160 --> 29:54.160]  just like a big fat button in the app that's like, Oh, you want to replace an Eero with a new Eero?
[29:54.160 --> 30:00.560]  Here's what you do 123 Wait 30 seconds for it to come back online, you're all set. And that's all
[30:00.560 --> 30:07.760]  all there was to it. Easy to set up easy to manage. I really love it. What do you do to find
[30:07.760 --> 30:13.440]  out more? They have a special deal by the way, for during fireball readers, you can get $100 off
[30:13.440 --> 30:18.960]  the Eero base unit and two beacons package. The beacons are the smaller ones that plug right in
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.680]  there like a little nightlight that many literally have a nightlight if you want them, you can turn
[30:23.680 --> 30:30.800]  that light off in the app. But one base unit two beacons package, you can save 100 bucks,
[30:31.440 --> 30:38.720]  and you get a year of their Eero plus service by going here, go to eero.com eero.com slash
[30:38.720 --> 30:42.880]  the talk show. And at checkout, just enter the same code as the URL slug,
[30:43.440 --> 30:49.760]  the talk show, and you'll save 100 bucks off their one base unit two beacons package.
[30:49.760 --> 30:55.360]  My thanks to Eero for their continuing sponsorship of the show. Don't know how long that's gonna
[30:55.360 --> 30:59.680]  last because the reason they've been in the news is was announced last week that Amazon is gonna
[30:59.680 --> 31:05.360]  gonna buy them. Don't know how that's gonna work out. But in the meantime, I you know,
[31:05.360 --> 31:09.920]  I recommend it a little bit weird, a little bit sad. I wrote that it's a little sad because I
[31:09.920 --> 31:15.200]  liked him as a plucky upstart in the hardware industry. And it seems like every plucky upstart
[31:15.200 --> 31:19.760]  either goes bust or gets bought by Google, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple.
[31:20.560 --> 31:24.640]  Yeah, it's becomes part of an ecosystem issue is is it seemed to me like they're doing pretty
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.040]  well on their own. They were, you know, one of the only one other real startup that's
[31:29.760 --> 31:34.720]  in that space. I think that's been that stayed independent. I think the rest got acquired.
[31:35.840 --> 31:40.080]  But yeah, they wanted the part of a bigger hole because they'll get pushed out or maybe they
[31:40.080 --> 31:43.040]  did their plotting in the future. And they said, you know, in three years,
[31:43.040 --> 31:47.360]  every company that has an ecosystem is gonna have a mesh system and there's gonna be no space for
[31:47.360 --> 31:51.520]  us in the market. So we got to have an exit plan or we're going to be going to be under me. I just
[31:51.520 --> 32:00.000]  use old tin cans, tin cans and string. That's this from the guy who used to run the Wi Fi working
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.560]  Wi Fi news blog to ethernet. ethernet is great. I have ethernet in my house and Wi Fi. Yeah,
[32:06.560 --> 32:10.320]  well, I'll be back the ethernet eventually, there's going to be some kind of vaccination
[32:10.320 --> 32:18.720]  apocalypse and everything's going to have to be wired to string it. A lot of news to cover.
[32:18.720 --> 32:22.720]  And it is even broke today. I'll just get this one out of the way because I wrote about it before
[32:22.720 --> 32:27.040]  I went to the doctor is the Wall Street Journal had a report today that Apple is teaming up with
[32:27.040 --> 32:34.400]  Goldman Sachs to do a credit card, like a MasterCard, an Apple credit card. And I have to
[32:34.400 --> 32:42.160]  say I just I'm not it leaves a bad taste to my mouth because I don't like the credit card
[32:42.160 --> 32:51.040]  industry. I think that it's I think the interest rates are too high. I really do. And I think it's
[32:51.040 --> 32:57.920]  too easy for people to get in debt. And it's like, you know, I mean, I'm, I shoot from the hip,
[32:57.920 --> 33:01.600]  but it's like I like I quipped on during fireball, you know, if this works out, what are they going
[33:01.600 --> 33:06.800]  to do next? Start doing payday loans at the Apple store. And I get it that all sorts of big
[33:06.800 --> 33:12.320]  companies, Disney has a credit card and and any place you go on vacation and hotels have their
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.960]  own credit cards. Every airline has their own credit cards. But to me, having your own credit
[33:16.960 --> 33:21.520]  card when you're not a bank is like something industries do like the airlines are the perfect
[33:21.520 --> 33:29.120]  example where they're long established, they're out of new ideas to make money, their margins
[33:29.120 --> 33:33.680]  are getting ground down every way. I mean, when you think of the airlines, at least in the US,
[33:33.680 --> 33:37.760]  do you really think of customer service oriented companies? Or do you think of companies who are
[33:37.760 --> 33:42.880]  looking for a way to charge you $25 to get another bag, you know, onto your trip? Yeah, it's like,
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.520]  it's always the Apple should buy a cable company. And I'm like, No, no, what's the most hated
[33:47.520 --> 33:51.760]  companies in the country? It's cable companies, and it's credit card companies. Yeah, they should
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.080]  definitely be involved in both industries that people although you can argue, there's an
[33:56.080 --> 33:59.840]  opportunity to change things. This is what I thought about Virgin America, which is I want
[33:59.840 --> 34:04.720]  to say the late lamented because I got folded into my second, second favorite airline is Alaska
[34:04.720 --> 34:10.480]  Airlines. So that wasn't terrible for me. But it's not the same as Virgin Virgin America. I felt like
[34:10.480 --> 34:14.800]  they always did everything they could do within the structure of terrible broken and dysfunctional
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.920]  system to make your experience better. Yeah. And that included I had a Virgin America credit card.
[34:19.920 --> 34:27.200]  And I think the annual fee was like $150. But it let you do free refunds and exchanges. Wow,
[34:27.200 --> 34:33.280]  tickets. That's fantastic bags, free bags and free food and a free, like class upgrade,
[34:33.280 --> 34:38.240]  like micro class to like, you know, premium customer coach or whatever. Yeah. And I was like,
[34:38.240 --> 34:41.520]  man, this was so in keeping with their philosophies. Like, yeah, yeah, we have a branded
[34:41.520 --> 34:46.000]  credit card. And we'll give you 1% or what I'll give you miles. But we're really gonna do is give
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.880]  you a better service because you bought into us. Yeah. On American, which is what I fly all the
[34:50.880 --> 34:56.160]  time. Premium coach really just means well, you're closer to the front of the plane. So you'll get
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.040]  off sooner. Like there's no dirty cup, we give you a clean difference in like leg room or anything.
[35:01.040 --> 35:05.600]  Whereas Virgin's premium economy actually had more like a little in like an inch or two of more leg
[35:05.600 --> 35:11.040]  room. It really was, you know, something. Yeah, they gave you free food. And it was, I miss them.
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.040]  But But like, I wonder, so does Apple. This is always that argument. Apple tried to do that with
[35:15.040 --> 35:19.200]  the cell industry. The cell industry was the most hated industry in the country just about besides
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.920]  credit card companies, cable operators. And Apple came in and said, we're going to do unlimited
[35:23.920 --> 35:28.800]  service, we're gonna do this, they forced change. And so the cellular industry is still kind of
[35:28.800 --> 35:34.160]  terrible. But it's morphed into something that is generally bearable. And especially when they got
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.200]  rid of overages, and they switched to throttling. So, you know, you no longer can wind up with $1,000
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.720]  bill accidentally, like is gradually gotten to that point. And so Apple was part of the push of
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.880]  Apple had never gotten into, well, who knows what kind of company be? If they've never released an
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.120]  iPhone? What would the cell industry be like? I'm like, do they have an opportunity to make the
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.520]  credit card industry less horrible by being involved in it? I don't know.
[35:57.520 --> 36:02.240]  No, I would be nice if that was there. I hope that's their attitude. And I hope it's not to
[36:02.240 --> 36:07.520]  make as much money as they can. profiting off people's debt that they shouldn't have
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.320]  incurred at the first place paying interest rates that should be in my opinion illegal.
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.120]  Yeah, like 20. I mean, I had some balance on a card. And I was like, I've got these I've got
[36:17.120 --> 36:21.280]  some money on some cards at 0%. I'm like, if you're gonna give me free money, this is actually
[36:21.280 --> 36:25.920]  less than the interest rate I have. And so I got paid off some balance. And I was like, Oh, I wonder
[36:25.920 --> 36:33.680]  what the balance transfer deal is now. It's like, you can transfer money at 20%. I don't seem right
[36:33.680 --> 36:38.240]  to me, like, I have good credit. And now I can understand. I mean, there's prime and subprime
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.880]  and whatever, like, maybe if I was bad credit risk. Well, like, I don't think that that's,
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.880]  that's a gotcha. That's a, we want you to accidentally not pay and pay just 20% interest.
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.040]  You know, maybe I'm misremembering. I don't know. But I did I ran up credit card debt
[36:55.040 --> 37:03.520]  that was unwise when I was in my 20s. And I, as I recall, though, I was paying like,
[37:03.520 --> 37:07.280]  seven or 8% interest. And I don't know, maybe I got a student rate, maybe that because that's
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.920]  when I got the card. I don't know. No, they used to be lower. They used to be like eight to 12%.
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.320]  Even when I mean, we're historic, still not historic, we're at a relatively low prime rate,
[37:16.320 --> 37:21.120]  relatively low interest rates. Overall, I was used to be prime plus like five or seven percent.
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.560]  I don't know. It's like prime plus 15. I was paying like a 8% interest. And it was way too
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.920]  much. It was it was everything. Everything. My dad told me not to do everything anybody with any
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.640]  sense tells a 20 year old in college who's finally getting credit card offers. Well, whatever you do,
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.520]  don't, you know, don't run up more than you can pay off in a month. And of course, I did.
[37:41.520 --> 37:46.800]  But you know, too. But now it's like, so Amy and I are in a situation where we're for years,
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.440]  we've literally only had one credit card, we have an Amex and and it's the only credit card we have
[37:51.440 --> 37:57.760]  we've debit cards for the bank and a couple other debit cards from like PayPal. And I have a square
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.160]  cash card. That's debit. I have Apple Pay card now that's debit, you know, it's all I have a
[38:02.160 --> 38:10.480]  gazillion debit cards and one credit card. And we were getting a mortgage two or three years ago.
[38:10.480 --> 38:15.120]  And that turns out I thought that was good. But it turns out that's bad. You're supposed to have
[38:15.120 --> 38:20.080]  two or three credit cards. You're supposed to pay them all off, but you're supposed to have more.
[38:20.720 --> 38:22.800]  And then we're like, well, should we get another credit card? And they're like,
[38:23.600 --> 38:26.560]  and they're like, it's too late now. Like whatever you do is canceled credit cards,
[38:26.560 --> 38:33.120]  it makes your credit score worse. Yeah. So yeah, so it's just this Kafka-esque situation
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.800]  where they're like, you should have two or three credit cards. So like, don't you have a target
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.240]  card or something? And we're like, no, we don't have a target card. You know, it turns out target
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.400]  actually has a very nice cash back thing where you get like 5% off all your target purchases.
[38:44.400 --> 38:49.120]  I didn't know that. So it turns out target card is, you know, is actually if you shop a lot,
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.240]  there's actually a good card to have. But I just thought it was sensible to have one card,
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.920]  you pay it off every month, the Amex we have, you have to pay off. I don't even think we're allowed
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.320]  to carry a balance. We do whatever we charge, we pay off at the end of the month. And it turns out
[39:02.320 --> 39:06.720]  that for your credit, that's actually bad. You're supposed to have two or three and pay them all
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.760]  off. But when you're in the process of getting a mortgage, don't sign up for more credit cards.
[39:11.760 --> 39:17.600]  That looks bad. You're supposed to already have them. So anyway, you know, a couple years later,
[39:17.600 --> 39:21.920]  we have the mortgage, you know, but we're thinking, you know, if, if that's supposedly
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.400]  better for our credit, why don't we sign up for another credit card? Yeah. And we're looking and
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.640]  we're thinking, well, we fly American all the time. So maybe we'll get this American,
[39:30.640 --> 39:38.240]  there's an American Airlines card, and it gets you. It sounds expensive. It's like a $400 a year fee,
[39:38.240 --> 39:45.040]  but it gets you unlimited access to the their lounges. And we, you know, in combination of
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.280]  Philly and Orlando for going to Disney and a couple other places where we travel,
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.880]  it would probably be worth it for the lounge access alone. And there's a couple other benefits,
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.880]  like a multiplier on your miles, you know, so we did a math bag fees. So it's like 75 bucks
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.480]  for the three of you. Effectively. Yeah. Effectively. It's like you get treated like
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.520]  you have platinum status, no matter what your status is. So yeah, it's, it seems like a decent
[40:09.520 --> 40:14.880]  card. But and we have no, you know, all we plan to do with it is charge our airline tickets,
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.880]  you know, for everywhere we go, henceforth, you know, to use that. Anyway, I'm reading the fine
[40:20.880 --> 40:26.160]  print of this thing. And it's like the starting interest rate is like 15% or 14% or something
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.320]  like that. And that's like, you know, and then it goes up from there. That's crazy.
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.640]  Absolutely. It's all gotcha. And this is the thing is you would think there'd be space in
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.800]  the credit card industry. Like, why is there not a disruptor in there at this point? There have
[40:40.800 --> 40:45.120]  been in the past, you know, discover was a whole different kind of model. There were other companies,
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.120]  but right now, I don't feel like there's anybody in the credit card industry saying, we are going
[40:49.120 --> 40:53.040]  to, you know, we're gonna have a high, you have to have a credit score of, you know, whatever,
[40:53.040 --> 40:57.440]  it's gonna be super high, you have to have 700 or 650 or whatever. So we're only gonna take people
[40:57.440 --> 41:02.160]  who are super high risk, or super low risk. But we're gonna have, we're only going to charge,
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.560]  you know, prime plus five. And so we're not going to encourage balances. But if you have a balance,
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.880]  it's not going to be, you know, 15 or 20%. I mean, I have, I have cards, I have a couple
[41:10.880 --> 41:16.640]  airline cards for this exact reason. I have the, I have a, the cheaper Alaska card, because I fly
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.360]  that just enough. And my wife and I both got United cards recently, because they're like,
[41:21.360 --> 41:24.800]  we'll give you like 40,000 miles, we're like, well, we know we've gone to, we were able to go
[41:24.800 --> 41:29.440]  to Europe, go to London for a couple weeks last summer entirely on miles, I cashed all the miles
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.720]  in. And then we both got United cards. And by next year, we'll have like, a couple hundred
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.720]  a couple hundred thousand miles, again, between bonuses, and I run all my business stuff through
[41:38.720 --> 41:44.240]  the card. So it's this really weird, you know, scam, but but the interest rate in the United
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.200]  card, I think is 25%. So we pay everything down, of course, crazy. I mean, I feel very fortunate.
[41:49.200 --> 41:54.480]  But how is that even a legal interest rate? That's usury. I mean, it's it's usurious. It's
[41:54.480 --> 41:58.880]  really, I just can't, I don't know why the mark, but the market should have solved that there should
[41:58.880 --> 42:03.280]  be a disruptor in the market that is well funded by somebody who's a, you know, Warren Buffett
[42:03.280 --> 42:06.880]  style person who's like, Yeah, yeah, I got billions of dollars, and we're gonna create
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.320]  the on credit card. Why, you know, I think that you did that somebody should be able to come in
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.680]  and do like, like you said, like a prime rate plus five. And it shouldn't even have to require
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.200]  that high of a credit card or credit rating, you know, like, you shouldn't even need great credit,
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.280]  it should be like anything but bad credit, you should be able to get in on that. I can't see how
[42:27.280 --> 42:35.280]  that's not super profitable. I really can't. I don't know. So I really a bit depressed reading
[42:35.280 --> 42:40.160]  that Apple is getting involved in this because it just really see it just seems like another
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.440]  canary in the coal mine of like ideas that companies have when they're out of regular ideas.
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.840]  Let's, let's sell a credit card. Yeah, I'll be curious when we see what their rates are,
[42:49.840 --> 42:55.680]  that's possible, it will be like a ridiculously old throwback rate, because that's the apples in
[42:55.680 --> 42:59.840]  the position where Goldman Sachs would never offer a card with a low rate. But Apple can say, yeah,
[42:59.840 --> 43:05.360]  yeah, we're self insuring the card, you know, with $50 billion from our store store or something like
[43:05.360 --> 43:11.600]  that, just have the wall and friend of the show and occasional guest Dan Fromer. It runs a mailing
[43:11.600 --> 43:17.520]  list point to party, which is all about, you know, he's a real he's a real super nerd on airline and
[43:17.520 --> 43:22.960]  credit card points. And I'm like enough of one where like, every once every couple of every year
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.960]  or so like I like I said, like my wife and I were just like, let's see if we're going to get one
[43:26.960 --> 43:30.320]  more credit card, what should we get? And we're like, well, you know, she get like a visa or a
[43:30.320 --> 43:34.960]  MasterCard, we can use it everywhere that doesn't take Amex. And, you know, seems like, you know,
[43:34.960 --> 43:40.720]  we'll get the most out of this American Airlines one because we fly American because 95% of all
[43:40.720 --> 43:47.760]  the planes that we Philadelphia are American. I get it that I get why people geek out on this
[43:47.760 --> 43:54.720]  stuff. And the journal story, though, is that Apple is not going to chase the this Apple credit
[43:54.720 --> 44:03.280]  card is not going to chase the sort of rewards oriented cards. There's going to do like 2% cash
[44:03.280 --> 44:09.440]  back. And I would presume like the journal even said, like, we presume some kind of discount on
[44:09.440 --> 44:16.080]  Apple stuff. Like maybe you'll get 5% cash back every time you buy something from Apple. I can
[44:16.080 --> 44:20.640]  only presume they would do that. It's because it seems like a no brainer if they're going after
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.720]  their best customers, you know, that seems like the most one of the most likely ways to get them
[44:25.680 --> 44:28.720]  in, you know, to get them involved, but they're not going to do anything like
[44:29.840 --> 44:38.800]  airline clubs, you know, or anything like that. But that their other point of appeal will be
[44:38.800 --> 44:44.160]  integration with the iPhone and that you'll get like Apple Watch style circles about your
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.360]  financial health or something interesting. And that doesn't seem appealing to me really,
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.400]  I don't know, my Amex thing has a great integration with iOS, you install the Amex app,
[44:55.200 --> 45:00.400]  and you sign in. And it's the same sign in you use on their website. And I have it set up,
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.680]  it gives me a notification every time my card is charged, which is great. I mean, I kind of trust
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.840]  them on fraud anyway. But it's, you know, and it just is a nice reminder of like, like monthly
[45:11.840 --> 45:16.400]  stuff that you have on your card. And it's like, it's just, to me, it's a nice reminder of Hey,
[45:16.400 --> 45:20.880]  why am I paying $10 a month for that I never use that maybe I should cancel it, you know,
[45:20.880 --> 45:26.800]  and it's just one alert when the cards charge, that's it. And I can go into the app at any time,
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.200]  they have nice integration with the Apple Wallet. So you can use your card with Apple Pay.
[45:32.480 --> 45:38.400]  And then I can go in the app and see all of my charges. And you know, the Amex app categorizes
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.800]  stuff if I want to see stuff like how much have I blown on restaurants in the last month, you know,
[45:42.800 --> 45:49.200]  very easy. It's just like a tab. I so I can't see what I can't see what Apple would do. That would
[45:49.200 --> 45:53.840]  be better than that. I mean, maybe other credit cards aren't as nice as the Amex app. But it
[45:53.840 --> 45:57.920]  doesn't seem like that would be a reason to sign up for an Apple credit card. No, I mean, yeah,
[45:57.920 --> 46:04.800]  I've got the the chase United card is, excuse me, the chase card is is just as well integrated,
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.920]  I've got an Amex and it's there so I can compare them. And the apps are very good. Like Apple's
[46:09.920 --> 46:15.680]  given good hooks and the Apple Pay works and wallet is great. And I can't think what else
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.960]  would be a benefit. That would be a typical thing. Like it's one thing if you go in the Apple Store,
[46:20.960 --> 46:25.760]  and the credit card does something fancy, but you know, how often is even the most avid person in an
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.720]  Apple Store buying something? Not very often. So I mean, the only advantage they can give you is
[46:30.720 --> 46:34.400]  it's got Apple's name on it. And maybe that's what you know, they're a lifestyle brand now.
[46:34.400 --> 46:40.160]  So people just want that card with the apple on it. It'll, it'll do that thing where you move it
[46:40.160 --> 46:45.360]  and it glitters just like the Apple Pay thing. Yeah, if anybody doesn't know there's a there's
[46:45.360 --> 46:51.120]  a very cool feature of the Apple Pay cash where you can tilt your phone, it does something with
[46:51.120 --> 46:59.840]  the accelerometer to create the illusion that the on screen card you see has like a holographic
[46:59.840 --> 47:04.560]  label. And, and it's more than just a cool feature. If you think about it, it's actually a way
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.640]  so that you know, like, if you know that to look for this, if you're worried like that, you know,
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.200]  like if I'm paypalling you 50 bucks to split a dinner tab, and you're worried that I just
[47:15.200 --> 47:22.160]  screenshot it. And I haven't really given you 50 bucks, I've just sent you to, you know, sent you
[47:22.160 --> 47:26.320]  an iMessage with a screenshot that makes it look like it, it wouldn't have that holographic effect.
[47:26.320 --> 47:30.560]  It's a way for you to say, yeah, this is a legit Apple Pay cash payment.
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.560]  It's a nice touch. And it's just what my question is always is, this gets you into that, like,
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.800]  Clayton Christensen thing is like, it's what is the job of the thing, right? And the question is,
[47:40.800 --> 47:46.640]  what is the job of a credit card and the job of a credit card is to make trends like for the
[47:46.640 --> 47:51.440]  consumer, the job of a credit card is to remove friction and fuss and make something like an
[47:51.440 --> 47:54.880]  invisible thing. I had this conversation. I don't know if you've had this conversation with Jonah,
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.280]  but at different times I have with my kids, my younger, who's 11 was like, it's like, what's the
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.880]  deal with money? Like he had done some dog walking, he gave me, he gives me a $20 bill to
[48:04.880 --> 48:09.280]  deposit for him in his account. And he's like, this is super weird. I'm like, Yes, it is. So
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.000]  he's gonna give me the money, I'll have the cash bill. And then I go line, I just transfer that
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.040]  into, you know, his accounts LinkedIn, because he's a miner. And he's like, what, how does money
[48:19.040 --> 48:22.960]  work that you just transfer bits around? Like, why does that make sense? And I'm like, it doesn't,
[48:22.960 --> 48:28.400]  like, it really doesn't, you know, it was only a few years ago, several years ago, that, don't
[48:28.400 --> 48:32.080]  think about it. Don't think about it too hard. You think about it too hard. It's like the Monty
[48:32.080 --> 48:37.600]  Python sketch the buildings erected entirely by hypnosis. And then you're like, let me tell you
[48:37.600 --> 48:44.720]  about what's going on in Venezuela. Yeah. Oh, geez. But like, I hate to laugh. It's terrible
[48:44.720 --> 48:49.200]  humanitarian crisis. But it's great. So you know, there are a bunch of pilots who are really bummed
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.400]  several years ago, because they're making a great living. Every night, they would fly pallets of
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.720]  checks from all over the country to Federal Reserve offices. And that was their job. They're
[48:58.720 --> 49:04.000]  on like midnight flights. And the checks would be brought in, right. And they would fly the physical
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.720]  checks to the 19 Federal Reserve offices or something like that. And I found this pilots
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.560]  forum, I was researching something about the check 21 thing, which made it possible to do
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.000]  photobased deposits of checks that we can do now, which has gone on for years now. But when this was
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.920]  new, and the pilots like this is terrible, like, like a big chunk of my living has been these,
[49:21.920 --> 49:28.160]  you know, midnight flights every week to apply checks. So, you know, you extract that. So we
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.240]  don't even fly checks. I take a picture of a check, if I get a check, or it's bits. And so
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.880]  it's perfectly reasonable. So So what is the job that an Apple credit card could do? That another
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.840]  credit card can't I can't think of a job. So I'm hoping they have one. It's not just, we give you
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.760]  5% back on Apple purchases. Oh, that'll be fine. I guess. Yeah, I don't know. I'm a little I don't
[49:47.760 --> 49:50.800]  know, a little stressed by it. Can I tell you, I'll tell you this, Dan Fromer actually turned
[49:50.800 --> 49:58.000]  me on to this card. Do you have the square cash app? Yes, I do. So what's the deal? There's some
[49:58.000 --> 50:04.160]  kind of special thing with that, right? Yeah. So I've had the square cash app for years. And and
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.280]  it's sort of, you know, just sort of fallen into the back of my iPhone is something I don't really
[50:09.280 --> 50:15.280]  use. I had used it in the past for things like, hey, here's a four of us are going out to dinner,
[50:15.280 --> 50:19.200]  you I'll pick up the check, you just give me the money, and then I could square cash, you know,
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.160]  you whatever it takes for me to do if it had, you know, usually you just put a bunch of credit cards
[50:24.160 --> 50:28.320]  in and the restaurant splits it, but maybe it's a restaurant that doesn't want to do that, you know,
[50:28.320 --> 50:32.800]  whatever, or you Oh, if you owe somebody 100 bucks for something, you'd square cash it to them. But
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.040]  now I use Apple pay for that. But I still had the square cash. But you what you can do in the
[50:37.040 --> 50:42.560]  square cash app is say I want the card too. And they send you a Visa debit card. It's kind of
[50:42.560 --> 50:48.320]  nice. You sign it on screen and then and then they like laser and etch your signature onto the front
[50:48.320 --> 50:52.960]  of the card. It's a it's a very cool looking credit card. It's just a flat black card with
[50:52.960 --> 50:56.880]  my signature. And you can draw whatever you want. It doesn't have to be your signature.
[50:59.040 --> 51:02.720]  But the thing that makes this card very cool that that Dan turned me on to is they have these
[51:02.720 --> 51:10.480]  things called boosts. And you go into the app, and you say pick your boost. And they wrote they
[51:10.480 --> 51:16.640]  change over time, like Shake Shack was on it for a while. And we have a Shake Shack in the
[51:16.640 --> 51:22.000]  neighborhood we go to. But they also have one that it's really the whole reason I got the card. It's
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.800]  just $1 off any purchase at any coffee shop. Oh, that's wild. And it's literally any coffee shop.
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.360]  It's not like well, here's our list of partners. It's Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and whatever.
[51:33.360 --> 51:37.360]  It's anything that's a coffee shop, even like neighborhood ones that I think this isn't going
[51:37.360 --> 51:40.800]  to work here because how square going to know this is a coffee shop. Well, they know it.
[51:40.800 --> 51:47.600]  And you can go in and get like a $2 just black coffee, and you get $1 back on every purchase.
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.160]  So it's like that's hilarious. And that's that's what I tend personally to drink at a coffee shop
[51:52.160 --> 51:56.880]  is just like a, you know, like the cheapest thing on the menu, a black coffee. So I'm getting like
[51:56.880 --> 52:02.160]  a 50% cash back on my coffee purchases. And even when I get something else, like for my wife,
[52:02.160 --> 52:08.640]  it's usually like the combined bill for two beverages is like six bucks. $1 back is 16%
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.840]  cash back. It's crazy. And it's, how is this possible?
[52:13.840 --> 52:19.920]  John, they make it up in volume. Exactly. This is Jack's well run company.
[52:20.960 --> 52:26.080]  Exactly. But they're doing not for square is apparently done very well. So I don't know.
[52:26.080 --> 52:30.400]  I'm trying to remember where they are in the profitable. I don't know. But it's by all
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.200]  reports square has made, like they've grown in a really sensible manner, they're making
[52:35.200 --> 52:44.160]  good decisions. So this is likely an incredible customer acquisition tool that then it got me to
[52:44.160 --> 52:48.800]  get the card, you know, and I'll tell you if you want me to get the card, if you've got the square
[52:48.800 --> 52:53.920]  cash app, which is free, and then you can hook it up to your bank account to load money in because
[52:53.920 --> 52:59.280]  it works like a debit thing. That's free. And to get money back out is free. You don't pay
[52:59.280 --> 53:03.600]  percent off on Whole Foods. I found his article and yeah, there's a whole so did you see this is
[53:03.600 --> 53:08.640]  a whole food is another one. And so the catch you think, well, how what's the catch? The catch is
[53:08.640 --> 53:14.160]  it's only up to like 150 bucks or something at Whole Foods. And you can easily go over that.
[53:14.160 --> 53:20.480]  But even so that's 15 bucks. Did you see the pictures we had a big snowstorm for Seattle was
[53:20.480 --> 53:24.480]  actually a fair amount of snow. Like we were all laughing about it originally. And then it just
[53:24.480 --> 53:31.360]  kept snowing and Seattle is hills and we don't have people don't have tires. I was talking I
[53:31.360 --> 53:36.240]  have friends up there. Brent, Brent Simmons and yeah, Gus is Gus Mueller is up there. Oh, yeah,
[53:36.240 --> 53:40.640]  yeah. So we were we were sort of shut down here. We were kind of prepared. But you probably saw
[53:40.640 --> 53:43.920]  the photos. People went into like bought everything off the shelves. And it wasn't like
[53:43.920 --> 53:48.880]  they're buying bread and milk. They're buying like arugula. And like goat cheese. It was like,
[53:48.880 --> 53:55.120]  something is left. And it's my wife went in and she sent me a picture. And I thought, well,
[53:55.120 --> 53:59.120]  this is funny. And then I searched on Twitter. And there are 1000s of photos of people just
[53:59.120 --> 54:03.760]  laughing. They're like, I'm at Fred Meyer. So the one place I went up before the storm,
[54:03.760 --> 54:07.840]  there's a Whole Foods near my house, they just opened. And they put it in a location that
[54:07.840 --> 54:12.000]  apparently nobody has discovered. And so I go there and the place is empty all the time,
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.160]  the people that are perfectly nice before the storm, their shelves were totally stocked.
[54:16.160 --> 54:19.920]  I should have bought more stuff there. But so I have a Whole Foods I can go to and always get in.
[54:19.920 --> 54:23.520]  But there's that Amazon connection too. So I'm gonna be paying, you know, Jack Dorsey,
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.120]  you're gonna give him money to use or actually take money from so that's okay. And then give
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.440]  the money. Yeah, it's Jeff Bezos up the street. But if you want to get in on the sweet, some sweet,
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.760]  sweet venture capital money that is just floating around out there, get the square cash debit card.
[54:37.760 --> 54:43.440]  And you can switch your boost in the app whenever you want. So you can go get a cup of coffee,
[54:43.440 --> 54:48.000]  get your dollar boost on the coffee purchase, and then head over to Whole Foods and switch,
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.560]  you have to go in the app and switch. You can only have one active at a time,
[54:52.560 --> 54:57.920]  but there's not really a limit. Like, the limits are all very, very fair. So like on the coffee
[54:57.920 --> 55:03.200]  one, there's a 30 minute timeout before you can use it again. Oh, sure, sure. So the idea is if
[55:03.200 --> 55:08.240]  I were going to buy coffee for me and you, I couldn't just use it for mine, then use it for
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.760]  yours and get $2 back. You have to wait 30 minutes. But you can switch immediately. You
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.120]  can switch to the Chick-fil-A one and go across the street and get a chicken sandwich and use the
[55:19.120 --> 55:23.920]  boost right away. Oh my god, you just saved it. Well, this is a great listener tip. Saved me a
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.360]  bunch of money. I don't know about the Whole Foods thing. I'm an Amazon Prime. So I go there and I
[55:27.360 --> 55:31.760]  scan my card and there's like, it starts to feel like you're playing a video game. You go in and
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.600]  there's the shelf tags are RF based and automatically update. They're like Amazon tags.
[55:37.600 --> 55:42.880]  Now use the square card and the Amazon and the scan my thing and 2d codes. It's amazing.
[55:42.880 --> 55:48.640]  I've heard that the Amazon Whole Foods merger is isn't hasn't gone as smoothly as Amazon and
[55:48.640 --> 55:55.760]  interesting, interesting, just that the Whole Foods business is more complicated than Amazon
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.160]  anticipated. I haven't believed it. I always wonder this is like, whenever anybody said Apple
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.160]  should go into business x, my reaction has always been business x has a tiny margin. Why would they
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.560]  do that? And so when Amazon, I mean, books can have a very large margin, some of the businesses,
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.840]  Amazon progressively entered businesses with larger margins, which is smart. And the Whole
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.120]  Foods thing is like the grocery business is historically classically a very high volume,
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.400]  very low margin business, and Whole Foods and a few of the other sort of fancier chains have
[56:24.400 --> 56:29.520]  been able to use merchandising and other things to crack that and, you know, crank the margin up a
[56:29.520 --> 56:34.080]  little bit. But most of what you're selling is like lettuce and milk and bread. And very little
[56:34.080 --> 56:40.160]  is, you know, sushi and, and baguettes or something. But I don't croissant so, or notepads
[56:40.160 --> 56:43.600]  or something. So I don't know. I mean, I just wonder about the synergy of you walk into the
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.560]  stores. It's like, is this when I buy an Amazon dash probably or dot probably not? I don't know.
[56:48.560 --> 56:53.280]  Maybe I will. It doesn't seem like it's the perfect thing. I do like the integration. There's
[56:53.280 --> 57:00.800]  Amazon lockers. There's that kind of thing. I don't know. Yeah, I enjoy Amazon's growing.
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.920]  I mean, I'm a big customer. I mean, I'm wary of them. And, you know, but I mean, we spend a
[57:05.920 --> 57:11.600]  fortune at Amazon all the time, we get all sorts of stuff from Amazon. You know, and they're,
[57:11.600 --> 57:17.040]  they're growing physical presence is intriguing to me, they just opened a new because there's a
[57:17.040 --> 57:22.320]  couple Whole Foods here in Philadelphia. And so they're all, you know, in the Amazon family now,
[57:22.320 --> 57:30.160]  but they just opened an Amazon locker. I forget where it's sort of like on the close to Penn here,
[57:30.160 --> 57:34.720]  but that's not too, it's not too far from us. It's close enough where it's closer than the last
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.680]  time I looked for where the nearest locker was to where we live. It was like, ah, I'd rather wait a
[57:39.680 --> 57:45.040]  day and have it show up in my house and go over there. Now it's like, oh, that's tempting. It's,
[57:45.040 --> 57:50.000]  it's, I don't know. And it looks very nice. It looks like a very nice clean place. It doesn't
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.040]  look, you know, sketchy at the least bit. But it is weird. It's weird to see Amazon in the real
[57:55.040 --> 58:03.280]  world. Cause it's a brand that I associate as not really being real. Right. Yeah. It exists entirely
[58:03.280 --> 58:09.840]  in a browser tab. It's yeah, it's, uh, I don't know what the real world objective. I mean,
[58:09.840 --> 58:15.600]  I don't know what Amazon is anymore. Uh, I don't know what they're supposed to be because the
[58:15.600 --> 58:18.880]  everything store was, you know, I don't know if that was their label actually, but that's what
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.720]  they get called. And like, I don't, I don't know what they are now. I think they're like a,
[58:22.720 --> 58:27.120]  like a ravening job machine or something. I don't know. I don't know. Even in Seattle,
[58:27.120 --> 58:32.240]  it's very confusing as to like, what, what is Amazon trying to do? Are they trying to be a,
[58:32.240 --> 58:38.560]  essentially a giant co-op? Um, who was it? Was it Matt Iglesias? Uh, somebody had that great thing
[58:38.560 --> 58:43.040]  years ago. I probably quoted this even on this podcast before that said, before Amazon was making
[58:43.040 --> 58:47.520]  a profit, it was like, Amazon appears to be a company. The shareholders are, it was
[58:47.520 --> 58:52.560]  evidently allowing. Yeah, it was great. Benevolently allowing, uh, its members to take all the money as
[58:52.560 --> 58:58.240]  discounts and now they're profitable. So it's a different thing. Uh, but what is the future of
[58:58.240 --> 59:03.520]  Amazon? Is it just, you know, they obviously believe they need to grow bigger, uh, and they've
[59:03.520 --> 59:08.960]  had setbacks and, um, you probably don't like it with the jobs. I don't know. It's just, I don't
[59:08.960 --> 59:13.040]  know what they are. I've read though that their profits, eh, it's managed. Like they make the
[59:13.040 --> 59:16.480]  profit. It's like, they just turn a spigot and it's like, well, let's have this much profit,
[59:16.480 --> 59:23.280]  you know, and let's, and it's also the fact that Amazon web services has become profitable and
[59:23.280 --> 59:27.120]  there's really nothing, there's really nothing they can do about it. Like they've kind of got
[59:27.120 --> 59:32.080]  to book those profits, you know, I guess they could reduce, just keep reducing the rates of
[59:32.080 --> 59:37.440]  everything. It's to be not, you know, to be break even, but it's almost like they can't,
[59:37.440 --> 59:41.920]  they can't turn down the profits from Amazon web services. Like they already have industry
[59:41.920 --> 59:47.120]  leading rates on a lot of, you know, these large scale online things that their, their retail stuff
[59:47.120 --> 59:51.120]  is still sort of run the way it used to be. I could be wrong on this. I'm not an Amazon expert,
[59:51.120 --> 59:56.400]  but no, I think that's true. Is that, is that they consistently, everybody, the big players,
[59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.720]  uh, Google and Amazon and a lot of the, um, there's a lot of smaller, I forget,
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.840]  IBM has business services, a bunch of people involved in that space and they continuously,
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.720]  everyone's continuously ratcheting down just slightly, um, often not by big amounts. And so
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.280]  like you're, you know, I do, I have various things hosted in various places and things just get
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.160]  cheaper all the time or faster or better. And it's kind of cool. It's like you get to see that, uh,
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:27.200]  improvement curve in your bill every few months. But, um, I was just talking to
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.440]  Krista, Morgan, uh, panic. She's doing a, uh, and I hope that maybe, I don't know if it'll be
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.960]  out before this episode, but I was talking to her about a retrospective of a 10 year ago thing with
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.080]  the gang at panic. Uh, anyway, it'll be fun. I was just talking to a lot of fun people,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.480]  but we were talking about the early days of podcasting and you know, which is not that
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.640]  long ago. Uh, and you know, the biggest, the biggest problem was that it was very expensive
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.280]  to host a hundred megabyte MP3 files. It was where the hell are you going to put it? And it's like,
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.000]  you put it on your regular web hosting account and it's like, Hey, the good news is you have
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.280]  a couple thousand listeners. And the bad news is you've got a thousand dollar bandwidth bill.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.600]  Uh, Mark, we did a bunch of figuring about like, you know, then there was like,
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.640]  do you put it on an edge server or a cloud, uh, just hosting the MP3 files of not even like
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.800]  my show length two and a half hour shows. I mean like you could do like a tight 20 minute show
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.040]  and you can like use 64 megabit per second compression to kind of make it sound, you know,
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.960]  go to the point where you can even hear it with your ears that it sounds a little crappy and it
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.240]  was just too big to host. If a couple hundred people were going to download it, it was a real
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.520]  problem. Whereas, you know, we've, you know, it blown past that. That's like a distant memory,
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.360]  but it wasn't that long ago. This is, this is something I was just looking up a Stewart
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.000]  brand's favorite, a famous formulation information wants to be free. And as you know, it's like
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.760]  that gets quoted because it's quoted inaccurately and it's only half of the formulation. It was
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.720]  information wants to be free, but information also wants to be expensive. And we went by free is
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.640]  he's like the marginal cost of, of providing information. This is in the 80s. He said this
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.600]  gets ever lower and now it's essentially zero. And what he meant by expensive was there's a value,
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.840]  like the expense wasn't necessarily money. It was that information has a value attached to it. So
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.880]  there's this tension between the ease of delivery and the value associated and, and how that works
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.080]  out. You know, sometimes you charge a lot of money. It's very easy to get. Sometimes it's
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.920]  very expensive to get like all these parameters, but we're now at a point where it's, it's costs
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.000]  essentially nothing to deliver any individual piece of content. It's only an aggregate that
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.920]  you have to start to worry if you're hosting 10,000 podcasts and they have a million downloads
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.920]  each. Well, then you're talking a little money, but even that money is not a crazy amount. But
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.200]  if you've got, you know, a talk show scale thing, it's essentially the bandwidth bill is effectively
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.880]  free no matter what you did. I mean, not exactly free, but it's not, it's nowhere near. You're not
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.320]  going to be spending tens of thousands of dollars like you would just a few years ago. No, it is
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.080]  amazing. Hey, before we get off the subject of credit cards, one of the things the wall street
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.920]  journal article brought up at, which I thought was interesting was that, uh, uh, that the rumor
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:15.760]  is that Apple's card is going to be a mastercard, which is the second biggest network in the U S
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.040]  behind visa. And it occurred to me, I know visa has more customers, but it occurred to me that I,
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.120]  I tend to think of visa and mastercard as being interchangeable because off the top of my head,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.600]  I couldn't think of any business that takes one, but not the other. Like Amex is pretty
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.920]  widely taken, but it's not that hard to find a place that doesn't take Amex. I know as somebody
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.480]  who carries one and that's why, you know, Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take care of it. Take my visa debit
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.520]  card. Can you think off the top of your head of an establishment that takes visa or mastercard,
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.880]  but not the other? I had this happen where I went to, where was it? I can't remember.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.680]  They only took visa. And at the time, all I had with me was a mastercard. Was it Costco Amex?
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.160]  It wasn't not, no, it was not Costco. Cause that's well known, right? They only do one brand
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.480]  at a time. I don't know if it was when I was in London, it was really, I was reading this. I was
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.120]  like, Oh, well I can pay with like, Oh, it throws you off that I just didn't have a visa at that
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:15.280]  moment in the right configuration. It was weird. So Costco only takes visa. Uh, and it's fascinating.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.400]  They cut out an amazing and they had Amex for many years and they cut some incredible, I mean,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:26.080]  they get some vast amount of kickback or proceeds or whatever. I'll put a link in the show notes,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:33.680]  but they, they only pay 0.4% processing fees on purchases. That's the sweetheart deal they got
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.200]  from a, and I think the standard for most companies on most credit cards is somewhere like
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:46.720]  North of 2%. So establishments pay like two to 2.5% processing fee on every single charge.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.880]  And they paid 0.4 and they, when they had Amex, it was 0.6. And so they talked visa,
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.000]  talked them down. They're like, we'll switch from Amex. We'll give you 0.4. And so Costco,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  well-known company, uh, very, very popular, devoted, devoted, uh, fans, uh, only takes
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.640]  visa because they have a, you can use any visa you want, but they have a Costco visa. You can
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.800]  sign up for an extra deals and they only pay 0.4% to visa on every purchase. It's an amazing deal
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.440]  because you have to be a member of Costco to shop there and they probably have some fascinating
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.280]  extra layer of fraud protection because they have such experience because they have so many deals.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:31.440]  So, so, uh, you know, you have with, with the card in hand, the odds of you being a bad customer,
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.280]  someone who's going to somehow have a fraudulent card or probably extremely low. So you're,
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:40.320]  there are, and it's also possible, I don't know this, I think Apple was engaged in this as well,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.880]  is that there's a backstop for fraud. And I think there was something, I remember there was talk
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.240]  when Apple, uh, launched Apple pay that they were going to provide like self-insurance against a
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:54.880]  certain kind of thing in order to secure a better rate or offer a better rate. And I assume Costco
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.880]  is in the same boat where they're like, they have such good fraud management that they're like,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.760]  look, it's gonna be 0.4%. And if we exceed X, whatever, we're going to pay that overage,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.440]  but they don't. Cause they know they, you know,
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.680]  that was the only one I could think of off the top of my head. And I do recall that it was,
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.440]  it was more of a problem in Europe. I think maybe that might be, I think you're right that
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.920]  in Europe visa might be more, you know, part of visa's edge over MasterCard is that,
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.320]  that they're out, but in the U S I'd only thing I can think of is Costco. And that's fascinating.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.760]  Uh, all right, let's move off, find personal finance advice.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.280]  Uh, a couple of rumors this week from Ming Chi Kuo, Ming Chi Kuo, and he,
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.280]  and he decorated them with some artwork that I presume that he made, he made himself.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.520]  I thought the most interesting of them was that he claims that Apple is working on an
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:49.760]  all new 16 or 16.5 inch Mac book pro. And I thought that was pretty interesting. My wife
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:55.760]  was a huge fan of the 17 inch Mac book pro, uh, absolutely loved it and has not been happy with
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.840]  any Mac book. I mean, she's had 15 inch ever since cause that's as close as she can get. She
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.600]  feels they're too small. She liked the, it's almost like an iMac like screen on, but it's
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.600]  a Mac book that she could move around the house. I have a 12 inch Mac book, so I'm a, a small format
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.160]  person. My kids think it's hilarious. I got the Mac book airs new models. That's kind of a long,
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.320]  like after, it's like, you know, you got seven year old computers, they're barely working. So
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.880]  one of them is going to be backed up. I'm like, maybe it's time we use some education money,
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.760]  upgrade them. So they're like, how can you type on that thing? It's so tiny. I'm like,
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:33.040]  no, I love my 12 inch, a little 12 inch computer. I'm a small, small laptop man myself,
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.480]  but I could see it, but it's interesting to me that Apple might go back to that. It seemed,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.760]  you know, I don't know, you know, I always, I'm always a little suspicious of Ming Chi Kuo's
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:49.120]  non iOS, uh, rumors because they seem to have a lower hit rate. It seems like he's way more,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:56.560]  he's always been more juiced in to the, the iPhone specifically, uh, maybe iPad secondarily.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.560]  But I thought that was an interesting rumor. Uh, I could see, I mean, there's a,
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.520]  there is definitely an audience for bigger, uh, bigger laptops. You see a lot of them on the,
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.080]  on the windows side, often for gaming, but there's still, uh, and I mean, uh, how long ago? Well,
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.200]  what was the 17 inch when there was a 17 inch Mac book pro? I don't remember what the actual
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.200]  screen display was. Uh, I don't remember what the resolution was, but I remember. And I remember
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:27.840]  where I saw one very specifically. I had a friend, uh, who was a very talented storyboard artist.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.920]  And I mean, this is probably 10 years ago at this point, but he did the storyboards
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.840]  for a lot of commercials and he did one for an AT&T commercial that was going to star
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.400]  Martin Scorsese. He wasn't directing the commercial, but he was the star.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:49.760]  And the premise of this ad was that, uh, uh, a little girl is being put to get bed by her
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.240]  mommy at nighttime and daddy's away on business and the little girl misses him.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:02.080]  And you know, and, uh, Martin Scorsese burst into the bedroom and he says, oh no, no, no, this is,
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.080]  this is all, this is boring. This is all wrong. Your dad's not away in business. He's in prison.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:10.560]  And the mom is like, no, he's not. He's in Newark. And he's like, no, he's in prison. He killed a
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:18.160]  man. And anyway, my friend did the storyboards for this Adam and he got invited to go up.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.240]  It was shot in Brooklyn in like a real house and he was invited. Do you want to come see
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.880]  this commercial be shot? And it was like, yeah, of course. Um, uh, and he, and he got like an
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.440]  and one and so I got to see it. Oh man, that's great. Yeah. I forget where I was going with
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.800]  this. Oh, I remember I was going is, uh, to see the setup of a truly professional, you know,
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.040]  commercial. This was, and it was shown, wasn't just shown on TV. It was like shown. I remember
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.240]  seeing the actual commercial in movie theaters as one of those ads they show you before the movies
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.320]  start. It was the first time anybody in history that I'm aware of was happy about seeing an
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.040]  advertisement before a movie that wasn't a trailer. But I was like, I was there, I saw this.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.720]  Um, but I remember specifically I was, you know, you know, as anybody who knows anything about how
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:09.440]  movies and commercials are shot, it's an awful lot of work and then very in between very short takes
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:16.800]  of actual filming. Uh, and I was fascinated by the setup they had. It was shot in a real family's
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.400]  home. Um, you know, and they, they like put, put like craft paper over all the family's real
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.440]  belongings and tape it all up. And they have these tape pathways like the, everybody walks in between
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.080]  these blue lines so that we're not, you know, uh, you know, going into rooms that we don't need to
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.800]  go into and we don't have to disturb their stuff. But they had like this whole mobile production
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.840]  center and they use 17 inch, maybe they were power books at the time. Maybe they weren't
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.840]  even Mac book pros. But they had like a couple of them set up to like immediately review the
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.080]  footage. I mean, and you've always known intuitively that like video, you know,
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.280]  video pros would use the biggest, biggest and most powerful Mac book pros they could get or,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.040]  or a professional photographer wants to see if you're going to look at the images as you're
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.360]  shooting. You want them on the biggest screen possible. But if you're not in a studio,
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.240]  if you're, you're out in the field, you know, that's going to be a, a portable computer,
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.600]  not a desktop computer. And that's just where I remember thinking like, oh, here's,
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.360]  who's buying all the 17 inch Mac book pros because they had like a bunch of them.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.480]  Oh yeah. And I think, I mean, I think that's, it's for video, but I think that's a very
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.760]  interesting point because I think there was, there was a point at which there were a lot more video
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.200]  professionals working on, not just on Macs. I don't know if they're all switched to high
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.640]  performance, you know Thunderbolt three linked GPS. I don't know what, I don't know what that
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.200]  market is now, but it seemed like that was a more significant segment of the market. And it
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.280]  included people who wanted the portability. It was anybody who needed that kind of power
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:53.200]  and the portability because there was no good, I mean, monitors were super expensive and not
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.200]  portable. And now you could probably, I mean, there are cases you can carry an LCD with you
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.360]  or you have a monitor in both locations. That would be crazy in the past because
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.800]  you spend so many extra thousands or $10,000 to do that. But yeah, there wasn't more. I mean,
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.760]  graphic designers, I know a lot of people had 17 inch monitor. They might have the Mac and then
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.360]  they'd have an external monitor, but then they could use the 17 inch one as well when they were
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.680]  working away from the office. So it, but that seemed to fall away. It seemed like more people
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:28.080]  had either a desktop computer or the, the retina display made up the difference for them plus the
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.560]  better brightness and so forth. I can't help but think that if it's true that this is not going to
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.200]  be a replacement for the 15 inch, that this would be an addition to the line because I, you know,
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.920]  I understand the simplicity of really only offering two sizes, 13 inch and 15 inch,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.520]  and you know, now it's three sizes cause they've gone back to 12 inch as you know.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:54.720]  Um, you know, there's, you know, and the Mac side, I think it's one of the things I like
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.560]  about being in the Apple camp is that I don't, I feel like I don't have to make too many hard
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:04.480]  decisions. Uh, like buying a windows laptop. It's like, it can be overwhelming. Like my son got a
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.320]  gaming PC for Christmas and my God, are there a lot of options? And it's really, you know,
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:17.440]  it's difficult. Uh, but you know, I feel like you've, I feel like adding, going back and adding
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:24.960]  a 16.5 inch or 17 ish or, you know, size display. It's, I don't feel like that's unduly confusing
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.440]  to the consumer who's just looking for a Mac book. Like you're going to know if you want to,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.040]  you know, if you want to lug that around and most people are going to say no, you know,
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.960]  most people want something, you know, that's going to be a lot easier to put in a backpack and
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.800]  lighter and they don't really have a need for that, a screen that big, but the people who do
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.920]  want it, there's an interesting problem that too is like, how do you decide what, what Mac you get?
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.040]  And, uh, when I was, we were going to upgrade, right. Our kids' computers, uh, we went through
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.600]  that where we're like, I, you know, the best, the best Mac, the best Mac is like a 2014,
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.120]  2015 Mac book pro, right? That's the best Mac, but we're trying to figure out the combination
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.760]  where we could get a high quality model from that era that had an SSD because I want future
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.320]  proofing and the speed. I don't want a moving, I don't want a rotating drive in there. Uh,
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.560]  and I wanted sufficient memory. So it's future proofed also, which means, you know, typically
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:25.760]  like 16 gigabytes. And, uh, so finding a 2014 or 2015 Mac book pro is an issue and then they're
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.760]  rather heavy. The Mac book air is not exactly the right choice, I think. I'm sorry. The Mac book is
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.320]  not the right choice. The single port and other limitations it has, hasn't been refreshed recently
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.360]  enough. So it's kind of a bad thing to buy in like late 2018, early 2019, the Mac book pro models.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.160]  I don't like the touch bar. I don't know if it has a future in the way that it's been expressed.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.360]  And it's also too expensive for what it offers. So the Mac book air was like, all right, you know,
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.760]  this isn't affordable in the sense of being cheap, but it's like the dollar amount. Like if this is
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.720]  a computer that they're going to have for the next seven years, which is feasible, is this the right
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.280]  is this the right one? And we figured that was probably the best use of money was to move in
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:11.520]  that direction. Um, plus the fact that Apple care now includes, uh, if you buy the extended care
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:18.560]  includes, um, a very small deductible, if you break the screen. So like, that's probably the,
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.040]  that's the right choice for kids. Yeah. Yeah, probably. That's what we did. Um,
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.240]  but the bigger one it's like, who wants the bigger machine? Like if you're either going to get
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.600]  your own monitor and a Mac mini Mac and Mac pros super annuated, uh, are you going to get an iMac?
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.440]  I have an iMac that I really liked, but you know, it's, you just don't have that many choices. So
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:42.080]  in that specific area, a 17 inch Mac book pro makes tons of sense because there's nothing
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.840]  that fits that exact need. If that is kind of the size, power and portability you need, there's no
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.960]  like a 15 inch doesn't cut it and there's no desktop. That's, you know, there's nothing
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.360]  that's going to be right in that space. Which brings me to, uh, Mark Gurman had a report
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:05.520]  this week for Bloomberg, uh, mostly about the progress that Apple has made on quote unquote
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:13.200]  marzipan, which apparently is still the code word for the, uh, transmogrify iOS apps to run
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:19.600]  on Mac apps, which was preannounced as, as a preview of future technology for third-party
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:27.280]  developers at last year's WWDC. And, and the, the big reveal was that in the meantime,
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.880]  Apple itself has used this, an early version of this technology to bring four apps to the Mac,
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:40.880]  Apple news, the stocks app, which is very, very similar to Apple news. Um, cause most of what's
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.240]  in the app, the stocks app is just business news about the companies, uh, the home app for home
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:51.600]  kit automation. And then the fourth one drawing a blank on what's the fourth marzipan app.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.400]  Oh, oh, whether no voice voice recorder. Oh, right. Which is one that I still have to write.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:07.120]  I I'm lazy and negligent. I have a rant in me about these apps, voice memos, right? And that
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.360]  it might be the worst of the bunch in terms of being the most incongruous on the Mac. Because
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.600]  one of the limitations of all of these apps is that none of them can open more than one window.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.160]  So like if you're reading, if you're reading an article on Apple news and you want to double click
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.840]  it so that you can open it in a window, cause you're not done with it, or you want to refer
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.920]  to it later and just keep reading new articles, you can't do that. And you can't, I'm not sure
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.240]  there's a, there's a Mac app that I've hated more than Apple news. I mean, in any version of it
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.800]  or, or in any incarnation, I feel like Apple news has been, I don't, I don't know who it's,
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.160]  the usual thing is what is this app for? It's not, it's trying to be flipboard and it has
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.920]  none of the redeeming features of flipboard. Right. It is a very bad Mac app. I, I enjoyed
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.520]  Apple news as a service. I like Apple news. I have my iPhone set to send me notifications
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.520]  from the New York times and Washington post, both of which I subscribe to.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:04.160]  Actually I subscribe to the journal too. I don't get many notification, but I get notifications
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.520]  from all three of those through Apple news. None of them overwhelming very seldom do I get one that
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.280]  is like, come on, that's nonsense. Don't send me nonsense. I mean actual news. I like it on my iOS
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.960]  devices and I liked it better when it didn't exist at all on the Mac. And if I happen to have an
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:27.200]  Apple news URL from Twitter or from an iMessage and I was on my Mac, it would just forward me on
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.640]  to the article in Safari, the same article, but instead of reading it in Apple news and now it
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:38.160]  goes now that I'm upgraded to Marzipan, it goes into Apple news and I get angry. It's a very bad
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:46.400]  app that should make you angry. I think the lack of being able to open multiple windows is, is most
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:52.480]  insane in the voice memos app, because why in the world would you not like, I get why the iPhone
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.360]  version doesn't let you open multiple voice memos at once. Cause you're on the phone and the phone
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:04.320]  is like a one thing at a time thing. And I kind of get it on the iPad because the iPad is sort of
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.280]  a big iPhone and it's simplified computing experience and it doesn't have the concept of
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.400]  windows. But the Mac, it is the most, would be the most natural thing in the world to open multiple
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:23.120]  of these memos at a time into their own windows and you can't do it. The Mac app store, the new
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.200]  one is not Electron, right? I mean, sorry, it's not Marzipan. No, no, but it's weird cause it feels
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:35.680]  it is weird. It is the new, it's its own thing, but it will open other windows, but only when you
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.160]  read, uh, articles in it. I think then it opens a kind of, is that another window or is it an
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.480]  overlay you have to click done in, but it's, it is neither efficient or foul, but it really feels
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.840]  Marzipan-y. Yeah. It has some very strange navigation in terms of it's all in one window
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.920]  and I've just opened an article. Now, how do I go back? Oh, I have to go up to the top right corner
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.000]  and hit done button. Yeah. And it, and it disappears down to the bottom like it was a
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.720]  sheet, but it didn't look like a sheet while it was opened. It's an evolving concept is what it
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.880]  feels like. There's a little bit too much of Apple. I mean, you know, look, I'm glad they
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.760]  released, I mean, Mojave has a lot of excellent features in it. There's things that use that,
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:24.800]  you know, for instance, the SMS, the automatic thing where it drops in, uh, second factors and
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:30.400]  codes and SMS. That's an incredible feat. Like that's great. That saves me time and it delights
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.640]  me every time. I'm like, Oh, it's just there. I just clicked this thing. It's fantastic. Right.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.400]  Um, so there are things to be said that are positive, but it's, it feels, it still feels
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.600]  like there's a lot of works in progress on the Mac side. Things that are, this is a good idea.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.680]  And, uh, but maybe, you know, a little more work could have been done before it was,
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:52.240]  yeah, it was pushed out. Well, so Apple told us at WWDC last year that this would be coming
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.760]  next year to third party developers in some form. Uh, and they would have more to say about it at a
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.640]  technical level at that time. I mean, it's very strange for Apple to announce something like that,
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.720]  uh, you know, in advance, they're, they're not really, but you know, I think they kind of knew
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:14.720]  that if they plan to ship these four apps in Mac OS Mojave, um, that people were going to figure
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.520]  this out. As soon as they got their hands on the beta of Mojave and poked inside the app bundles,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.120]  they were going to say, Hey, there's something weird going on here. You know, these things look
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.080]  like iOS apps in a lot of ways. And you know, the smart hackers are going to figure it out.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.560]  So they had to kind of get in front of it and say, yeah, yeah, these are iOS apps. Um,
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.680]  Garmin's report was a little curious because he said that this year's focus will be on iPad apps
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:48.320]  and that iPhone apps would be a year later because Apple's engineers have had a hard time getting,
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:54.320]  figuring out how to get small screen iPhone apps to run on the Mac. And Steven trout and Smith
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.840]  pointed out like, that's a little weird in some ways, in some ways it seems like it would be
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:02.800]  easier to get iPhone apps rather than iPad apps to run because you could just run them in a roughly
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:09.760]  iPhone size window. Like the, the thing about windows, isn't just that you can have multiple
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.040]  of them on screen at once. It's that they can be any size that you want or need or what makes sense
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:20.320]  for your app. As I, as I sit here and look at the little tiny Skype window that tells me, I've got
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.480]  a Skype recording going on in the background, right? It's just like a little thing floating
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:28.800]  above my windows. And it's like the size of a business card here on my screen. So it's not
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.560]  obstructing more than it needs to. You know, that's part of the flexibility of a
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.800]  tiled window, graphical user interface, and that you could, if that's what you wanted
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.760]  to have an iPhone app running on your Mac, you could do it in a little window.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.440]  That's that size. And one of the reasons that iPhone apps that haven't been adjusted to scale
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.120]  and use size classes, et cetera, to, to have an iPad counterpart that truly embraces the nature
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.120]  of the iPad. One of the reasons that those apps are weird on iPad is that when you run an iPhone
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:08.320]  only app on the iPad, because the iPad doesn't have windows that it can run in. It just puts it
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.440]  in an iPhone size thing. I've always thought it's so weird to do that. I still have, there's a
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.000]  handful of apps like that. Did Instagram ever come up with an iPad app? That's what I thought.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.680]  Instagram is exhibit A. I say that and I'm just like, that can't be right. Like every time I think
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.320]  that it's like, that can't be right. And then I launched it on an iPad. I'm like, wait, there is,
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.200]  why? You know, there's no, there's no reason or sense for it. And they can make a really
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:38.160]  interesting given how much in the way Instagram is used. They can make a great, it's the most
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:43.200]  baffling thing in the world to me. One only thing I've ever heard that anybody say that makes any
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.760]  sense at all is that I forget the size of photos that, that Instagram, like when you update your
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:55.120]  Instagram feed, what the pixel dimensions of the photos that come down are, but it's small enough
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.160]  that they wouldn't, unless they updated it, it would, they wouldn't quite be naturally retina
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.320]  on an iPad. I think they've been quietly, like if you zoom, you know, you can't, uh,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.120]  tap and make pictures bigger on Instagram, but you can, you can pinch and zoom. Right. I think they
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:13.920]  actually do build more resolution in and have for a bit, because once you were able to do that and
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.680]  put different, remember when they add that feature that you can have different, uh, you know,
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:21.520]  portions to the square. I think there's more resolution under that. And I assume that was
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.680]  a building block for the next thing. Even if they, even if they just made an iPad app and,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.640]  and it had to scale the images artificially to some degree, it would be better than what they
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:40.160]  have now. Photos are the one thing that looks bigger, the better. Right. And I just, I don't
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:46.400]  get it. It's one of my very favorite things about having an iPad and using an iPad is if I go on a
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:53.040]  vacation or there's a school event or something, and I've shot a hundred photos and I want to,
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:57.840]  let me go through my photos and throw out the garbage and, and pick the winners that I might
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.160]  want to share with people doing it on the iPad. I just love, I love it. It's one of those things
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.800]  I love on the iPad more than any, more than a Mac, more than an iPhone, because it's like this
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.480]  perfectly intimate it's, it's so big. I can see detail that I couldn't see if I just did it on
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:17.600]  the phone. It's like so much easier to see, Oh God, this one's no good. The one person's eyes
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:23.040]  are closed, but you couldn't see it on the phone because it's too small. And it's just, you know,
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.200]  the pinch zoom is so much more natural than doing it on the Mac. It's, it's so great. Instagram on
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.800]  iPad would be so great. It's the iPad has a magic window and the iPhone is a different beast. I
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.640]  have always thought it's interesting how distinct the iPhone and the iPad are. Even when you get a
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.760]  large iPhone or a small iPad, they really are different animals and people tend to lump them
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.400]  together. I think who write about the technology or, you know, write about it from a marketing
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.280]  technology business standpoint, when you know, the iPad remains, it's like, it is a magic window.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.120]  And in apps that don't take advantage of that are always stunning. But yeah, that is, that is weird.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:06.080]  But I could, so yeah, so, so for most apps, most sensible apps, if it's the iPad version is what
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:11.920]  shows up in Marzipan and the first iteration in Mac OS, then that's fine, right? You're going to
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:15.840]  get a decent size display. I don't think it's fine at all. I think this is deeply problem.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:22.640]  No, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't mean it's good, but I mean, there's a, there's, it makes some,
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.200]  it makes some sense that that's the form factor you choose, right? Don't get me wrong.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.480]  I think there's an awful lot of problems and I know there's so many problems with this idea.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.440]  A, there's the existence proof of the four ones that Apple has done so far. And they are very bad
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.800]  Mac apps. One of the ways that I've mentioned, I keep harping on it, but it's very, very bad
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.880]  that these apps are limited to one window. And there are ways where you would naturally want to
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.720]  open a second window and you can't and it feels incredibly frustrating and terribly un-Mac like.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.600]  But that's, that's an assumption that iOS developers have safely made for a long time.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:04.960]  It is not going to be easy to take an iPad app that assumes that there's only one UI window at
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.440]  a time. And that one UI window takes up the whole screen to be updated for multiple UI windows. And
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.880]  this might coincide. There's been rumors that, that one of the, you know, Hey, let's give some
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:22.720]  love to the iPad side of iOS would be to, to at a low level in the OS, give apps a better
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.840]  system-wide, this is the standard way to do it in, in the system frameworks to do multiple documents,
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.600]  which I presume would be sort of Safari style tabs. You know, Safari obviously has the ability
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.200]  to open multiple tabs and has had, had that ever since the iPad existed. Cause it would, you know,
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:46.400]  who would want to use the iPad if you can only have one Safari window open at a time. So how
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:53.920]  do you do, you know, but, but adopting that if, even if I, if that comes at WWDC this year,
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.160]  it's going to be a lot of work for developers just to update their iPad apps, let alone do it
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.160]  in a way that makes sense on the Mac. Yeah. And I thought the changes to the app switcher for the
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.000]  iPad were actually really great cause it's, you know, it's now it's a very native it's,
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.040]  it makes more sense in that form factor, the way you see apps. And it's, it also, it felt to me
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:16.640]  like it's a prelude to document management in that same style is providing a, a preferred way
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.680]  for you to show multiple documents or tabs, you know, there's the app screens. And then if you do
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.600]  something else, you get the document screen. So it's kind of a zoom in out kind of thing. So,
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.440]  I mean, I don't know if that's what the UI will look like, but at least there's a, there's a,
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.400]  they've changed the approach from the iPhone form factor. So they're thinking about it differently,
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.840]  but then it wasn't extended beyond that. My hope would be the one class of apps that I could see
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:47.840]  this making sense and okay, the Mac is now better for this than it was before would be like media
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.800]  consumption apps. Like, so there is no, there's no native Netflix app for the Mac. Like if you want
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.920]  to watch Netflix on your Mac, you've got to go to a web browser and you lose all sorts of things.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:04.320]  Like the big one is you can't do offline access and you know, it, it's a huge, you know, if you're
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:10.640]  ever, you know, we were talking about air travel before. I mean, I know that, you know, they always
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.360]  think that wifi on an airplane is not going to be good for watching Netflix. No, no, no, no,
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.440]  not unless it's, I mean, there's those things where they cash movies on the plane, but that's
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.480]  a different, that's different than you, you know, you've got to pick from their cash of movies. And
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:30.400]  even then it's, in my experience, it's kind of sketchy. So the fact that iPad can, you can say,
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:35.440]  can you can say, Hey, give me all 10 episodes of this show. I'm going to watch it on the plane.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.360]  And then they're just there on your iPad. You never even have to take your iPad out of airplane
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:43.680]  mode. You don't even have to pay for the wifi. You they're just there and you can watch them
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:48.880]  and you Mac can't do that. That kind of stinks. And it's, you know, kind of frustrating because
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.680]  the Mac in theory is the more powerful capable computer, but it doesn't have a Netflix app.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:01.200]  And so if it would be easy for Netflix or easy ish for them to take their iPad app and turn it into
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.840]  a Mac app that has those features, I think that would be a win for the Mac and limiting it to
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.880]  single window, et cetera. It doesn't really feel like a limitation. Like you're going to want to
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.280]  run the Netflix app full screen, probably anyway. Yeah. How many movies are you going to watch it
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.920]  once? Right. And I, you know, I could probably see the same thing for something like overcast.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:25.920]  Wait, do people watch four movies at once? Like they do podcasts at double speed.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.400]  We're going to watch four episodes at once. I'll just tile them on my screen.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.120]  Well, I don't know, but so I can see it for those apps and you know, there aren't, I,
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:40.000]  most of those type of media consumption apps for lack of a better term. I mean,
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.800]  I was just watching a basketball game on ESPN last night on my iPad. You know, I don't,
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.320]  there's no ESPN Mac app, you know? So there's all sorts of things that,
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:52.240]  No, it's perfect. And the, the picture in picture thing too, it's like you, you obviously want on
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.920]  your Mac. I mean, I know you can do it in Safari, but having a Netflix app or other or TV app or
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:05.280]  whatever that is, um, I it's basically the iPad version with Mac OS, whatever, and that it then
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.000]  can be sized on your screen. I mean, I've got this 20 something inch. I can't remember how many
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.720]  inches I'm back here and be able to resize it and have it in the corner. If I'm watching news in the
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:19.360]  background, that would be great to not have it tied to Safari. So there's a clear case for it.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.880]  I remember talking about this with somebody and, but it's like all these other apps. It's like,
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:28.640]  man, it would just, I can't think of what would make it other classes of apps. I can't see how
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:34.160]  the iPad app running on the Mac without redoing it from scratch. And if you were going to do that,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.760]  why, you know, where's the benefit engineering and, and code base wise from just making a Mac
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.760]  app in the first place. Yeah. I've wondered if it's a nail or a hammer looking for nail
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.400]  with this whole thing. Like I understand that it would make sense for Apple to converge and
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.680]  for developers to have a smaller code base. But you, you think if there were, let's say we were
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:58.480]  talking about it and we had a hundred examples of apps or 20 categories, but we don't, you know,
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.480]  and the ones that Apple did initially are simple ones that are largely unused or, or interesting
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.640]  to most people, especially in a Mac environment. Like why would I use the stocks app when I have a
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.880]  website I can use that does stocks, right. And it's much more sophisticated. So it's not like,
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.880]  and you're, you know, me streaming media, absolutely perfect case. And like, what is case
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:23.040]  number two? You know, I can't think of a thing that I use on the iPad that I would want in a,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:29.840]  to have an iPad version on my Mac, even if it took on some Mac properties that was single windowed.
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.480]  I use a couple of iPad apps that have Mac counterparts. Now I use the app things to
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.680]  manage my two dues. I love Omni outliner. The Omni group has a bunch of great apps.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:49.600]  The one that I use is Omni outliner. They're Mac apps for things and, and for the Omni group
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:58.240]  that they don't look like iPad apps running on the, they look like real Mac apps. And conversely,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:04.080]  their iPad apps don't look like Mac apps running on an iPad. You know, there's just very different
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.680]  interaction models. And I just don't see how this is a good thing for anything other than
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:14.800]  media consumption. We're nine years into the iPad and no one has yet made a good case for why those
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:21.920]  should be interoperable or why they should be the same platform. So either Apple has some really
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.800]  clever ideas that they haven't told us about and haven't occurred to people who are developers or
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.280]  think about how this stuff works, or it's just not a great idea. And it's being driven by
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.200]  forces that don't actually have a great advantage, but which is a shame because we don't really want
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.600]  to get shoehorned into something that is not good or useful. I mean, you know, you could argue,
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.040]  there was a report out actually, as we record this, I think from Axios about the ARM migration
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:59.040]  that's upcoming. I know for you to post something just before I think we started recording. And
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.600]  there's some reports that there was actually like a more like a timetable about ARM-based
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:13.600]  IMAX, or I'm sorry, ARM-based MAX. And so in that environment, Marzipan and cross-platform
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.520]  development maybe makes sense because you're migrating to the same platform. But I don't know,
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.840]  I mean, how critical is that in a cross-compiling world? Like I'm not a developer.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:29.120]  I really don't think it was a bigger problem with the earlier transitions, especially the 68K to
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.680]  Ford PowerPC one, because it was so early in the industry where writing stuff in writing
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:48.160]  your most intensive algorithms in 68K assembly code was more of a thing. And making assumptions
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.920]  about whether it's a big-endian or little-endian machine because you're actually dealing with these
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.560]  bytes on a byte-by-byte level and you need to know the order was more of a thing. After the second
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.880]  time, anybody who's been writing code that assumes that you're on an Intel processor is an idiot.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:12.080]  And I know people who work bigger companies. And they know that. Adobe is not going to get
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:18.640]  caught flat-footed in like, oh, shit, our stuff can only run on Intel. That's not going to happen.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.320]  I'm not saying that somebody with something as complex as Photoshop can just open it up in
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:36.320]  Xcode and click a checkbox and spit out an ARM version of it. But they're ready for that.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:50.880]  So it doesn't feel to me like having ARM-based processors is the motivation
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.840]  for this. So there is some kind of... But there's clearly...
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.440]  The one thing, even if it's not assembly code, the one thing that could bite some apps
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.680]  maybe in the scientific community would be if you're relying on Intel C compilers,
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:08.640]  as opposed to the default LLVM ones, which should be able to... Anything you've been compiling
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:17.520]  through LLVM for X86, you should be able to just click a checkbox and spit out ARM. But if you're
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:25.520]  relying on Intel's compilers, you might have a bit of work ahead of you. But they're not the
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:33.200]  default, and that's sort of an esoteric scientific commuting thing. I don't want to teach a computer
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:39.040]  science class here. No, but the other thing that I thought was so funny too about... And I didn't
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:43.760]  mention this, but I thought I'd save it for the podcast, was that Gherman had this report on
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.320]  Bloomberg. It was eight or nine paragraphs, mostly about Marzipan. And then the very last sentence
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:54.080]  of the report was, sources at Apple say the company is considering unveiling its new Mac Pro
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.880]  at WWDC. And I had two thoughts on that. The first is what I did write, which is, it better be
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.760]  unveiled at WWDC because it certainly doesn't look like it's coming... They've said it's a 2019 thing,
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.520]  but they announced this initiative in April of 2017. The whole thing where they invited me and
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:18.960]  Panzorino and Ina Fried, speaking of Ina, and said, hey, we kind of made a mistake with the
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.160]  trashcan Mac Pro, although they of course didn't call it the trashcan Mac Pro, but the phrase was
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:32.800]  that we've backed ourselves into a thermal corner and did not anticipate the rise of GPUs as
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.680]  the force that they've become in terms of intensive computing today.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:47.440]  And they even told us that, and they said, hey, we've got a cool iMac Pro, or they didn't call
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:53.040]  it that. They said a Pro iMac coming out, and we think this is going to be great. But we now see
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:38:01.040]  that there is a need for people who that's not even good enough for, a real Mac Pro with a
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:06.240]  modularized design. And we're working on that. And then last year they said, yeah, we're still
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.760]  working on that. It's still a thing, but it's probably, it's not a 28... They didn't even say
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:16.880]  probably. It's not a 2018 thing. It's a 2019 thing. It doesn't seem like it's coming out
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:22.880]  anytime soon. There are rumors of a March 25th event that Apple is going to hold at the
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:29.040]  Steve Jobs theater, which is supposedly, I don't know anything about it, but supposedly focused on
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.680]  subscription content, some kind of Apple news subscription thing, possibly the unveiling of
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.960]  their original video content subscription thing. That does not sound like an event where you would
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.400]  unveil Mac Pros. They could, you know, they could just say that they don't, they don't usually in
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.760]  spring, they'll do laptops some years, right? But if they don't, you know, but if they have
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:57.760]  one event in March 25th, I don't think there's going to be another event until WWDC in June.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:03.360]  And that's the right one. Yeah. That's the one to announce a Mac Pro at too. It is weird. I mean,
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.000]  you know, people, this gets us back to that whole thing about like, you know, is the company can
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.280]  Apple execute well? And look, I read your report card. I read Jason Stull's summary. I filled out
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.960]  a report card for Jason Stull for six colors. And I read the summary and there, you know,
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.960]  there's a lot of dissatisfaction among those of us who are longtime users of various platforms
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:27.440]  about Apple's consistent ability to execute. And the Mac Pro, it's weird to me. It's like,
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.880]  if you have a deep bench and a lot of money, why can't you make this in a finite amount of time?
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.640]  And they are not. And that's been the issue that was, people were concerned about that with the
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.880]  Mac mini, which finally shipped and seems perfectly fine. I haven't done a deep dive in it, but it
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.720]  seems like a perfectly fine update. There's something that's not right there. There's a
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:52.080]  sense among people who truly want whether I most of the personal at a personal level, the most of
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:57.840]  the people who I know who are most looking forward to a Mac Pro are developers. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:03.760]  But I, you know, I know people who are in the graphics world and video world who, you know,
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.200]  are in that scheme, too. But most of them, you know, I the consensus is that the old Mac Pro
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:14.160]  was the right idea. It's a big tower. It's a big, big tower with lots of cooling. And then when you
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.640]  open it up, there's lots of room inside to put more stuff in. You know, if if what you need is
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.120]  for video cards, you can put four video cards in there. If what you need is lots of storage,
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:30.080]  you can put lots of fast storage inside the box, if that's what you want. Just build a big tower
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.000]  that that has lots of cooling to keep everything cool. And then you're done. And the consensus is
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.960]  that the trashcan Mac Pro was Apple getting too clever by far by saying you don't need a big
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:46.480]  tower. Here's this little thing. And it is beautiful. And it looks like nothing else any
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:52.480]  computer makers ever made as a professional workstation. And it was too clever by far because
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:57.840]  it a lots of people I know who have one have had to replay have the video card replaced at least
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:05.600]  once because even with the built in video card, it was too hot, let alone expandability to faster
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.840]  and faster and hotter and hotter video cards as the years went by. And so I think the fear that
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:17.360]  these people have is all we ever wanted is for you to make a big, fast, airy tower. That's it
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.560]  just just put all of Intel's latest stuff in a big tower and call it done, which is sort of what you
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.280]  had before. And don't get too clever. And why in the world is it taking you two hours, two years,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:32.240]  two hours, two years to do this unless they're getting too clever again, by far, because
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.880]  did Apple get obsessed by Thunderbolt three based GPU? Oh, I think. Yeah, I mean, because that
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.520]  seemed to be their answer was like, I don't know if they said that or if it was hinted, but it was
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.280]  like, look, all these are coming down the pipe. There's 40 gigabit per second symmetrical, blah,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.080]  blah. The answer is not to stick in bigger video cards, because the thermal issues for I mean,
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.920]  you've seen some of these cards you can get on the PC side, and they're nuts. And you just want
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:03.040]  to stick four of those into a Mac. I mean, the cool it just it's a whole different engineering
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.720]  project. So my my and I'm not a developer. So I don't know if this it doesn't make sense in
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:15.120]  developer science for different uses. You know, like AI processing and things like that. But I or
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:20.000]  animation, but I just it felt to me like they're like we you just like Thunderbolt three is the
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.440]  answer for now. And maybe we'll figure out something else later. But I don't feel like that
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.400]  potential was realized. Well, you can buy Thunderbolt three connected GPUs, but I don't
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.440]  feel like that actually solved the problems people were trying to address. Well, anyway,
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.440]  to wrap up the segment, the thing that I found ironic that I didn't write about, but I'll mention
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.240]  here is is here's this article from German talking all about how they're going to have all these ways
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:46.800]  to run iPad apps on your Mac. Oh, and by the way, we're going to come out with this fancy, probably
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.320]  567 thousand dollar professional workstation. Hope you enjoy running tablet apps on it. Right? Like
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.960]  what a mixed message for one article. Here's this here's this computer that we're making because we
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:04.000]  hear you that even the iMac Pro isn't pro enough for some of your needs. And you can run an iPad
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:11.280]  app on it. That's not exactly a clear message. All right, now seems like as good a time as any
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:22.480]  to take another break. Think think our next sponsor. It's a molecule. M o l e k u l e.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:29.760]  Unlike HEPA filters molecule destroys indoor air pollutants at a molecular level, completely
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:38.640]  removing them from the air you breathe. Molecule uses photo electrochemical oxidation. It's called
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:48.320]  Pico PECO nanotechnology to eliminate allergens, mold, bacteria, viruses, and airborne chemicals.
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:54.720]  It's a scientific breakthrough, and it enables Pico to destroy pollutants 1000 times smaller
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:01.600]  than HEPA filters can capture. Molecule replaces 50 year old tech antiquated technology. Imagine
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.320]  if your phone was the same as it was in the 1940s. That's exactly what the technology you're using
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:12.080]  to clean the air in your home. 50 years old. The last major innovation was air purification in the
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:18.880]  1940s. With the HEPA filter. That's World War Two stuff. Molecule introduces breakthrough science.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:24.080]  It's finally capable of destroying air pollutants at a molecular level, goes well beyond HEPA
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:31.760]  filtration to not just capture but completely destroy the full spectrum of indoor air pollutants,
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:37.680]  literally up to 1000 times smaller than the stuff that HEPA filter can trap. It's a clean design,
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:42.720]  high quality experience. It's it's, you know, hate to say it's like the apple of air purifiers.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:46.640]  It's really, really nice stuff. Really nice devices that looks nice. It's not like a big
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.440]  ugly thing you have to put in your house. And from the materials on the device to the sleek solid
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:56.720]  aluminum shell to the streamlined filter subscription where replacement filters arrive
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.400]  at your doorstep when you need them. You don't have to worry about it. You have to worry like
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.880]  is it time to get a new filter just shows up on a regular basis right when you're ready to replace
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:11.680]  them. It makes breathing clean air as easy and seamless as possible. It'll be better for your
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:18.080]  sleep, better for your health. And they've got research backed by the EPA. It's extensively
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.080]  tested by third parties and verified and their claims and their technology have been tested
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.760]  by laboratories like the University of Minnesota Particle Calibration Laboratory
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.760]  and the University of Southern South Florida Center for Biological Defense.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:39.360]  Really great stuff. And they have a special deal for listeners of the show. You can save 75 bucks
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:47.840]  off your first order by going to molecule.com. That's m o l e k u l e.com. And then it check out
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.720]  enter the code talk show. That's all you have to do. You get 75 bucks off with that code talk show.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:02.000]  My thanks to molecule for sponsoring the show. We've got more we've got to go into the speed
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:10.880]  round, I guess. Other topics a busy week. Jeff Bezos is members last week. So what's the
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.520]  Well, how about this? Samsung had a big new big event yesterday. Yeah. They call it watch their
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:23.680]  coverage these days how people write about them. Well, and they're, they're in a weird space.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:29.920]  They're in a weird space, you know, like where five years ago, I guess it's six years ago now,
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:34.960]  but it was right around 2013. Where the consensus was that Apple is in trouble. You know, Steve
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.280]  Jobs have been dead two years that was the peak of Apple can't do it without Steve Jobs. Samsung's
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:47.120]  eating their lunch, you know. You know, it wasn't just that, quote unquote, Android was going to do
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.680]  the iPhone and it was Samsung in particular. Yeah, and nobody's really saying that anymore.
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:56.160]  But they're still you know, they're obviously a major player at a high level, at least in the US.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.160]  I know that one of the weird things that's happened to Samsung is that they they've been
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.920]  pretty much wiped out of the Chinese market. Like Chinese brands like Huawei and a couple of others
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.520]  have taken up the Android slack inside mainland China and Samsung I forget what their market
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.080]  showed. They had like 19 18 or 19% at one point inside China for smartphones and now it's like
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:23.920]  under 1%. It's crazy. But they're obviously still a big player in in the West. They obviously do
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:30.480]  really good screens. They can do cameras. You know, it was interesting. I know I watched the
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.200]  actual keynote on online. And it was fascinating staging. Did you look at it at all?
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.200]  Yeah, I saw a picture of this. I saw your call out about that, too. And I'd seen pictures and
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.800]  didn't understand what I was looking at. Then you mentioned that I went back and looked and I
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.720]  thought, it's actually was my reactions. It's really sad when the takeaway from an announcement
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.360]  is, wow, they did a really good job on the stage with a very, they were very innovative on stage.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.800]  But yeah, it was something I've never seen before.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:05.760]  Yeah, they it the stage itself was was display, and then they wrapped around the ceiling above
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.960]  the stage. So like the presenters who came out were, you know, sometimes they turn it off, and
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:16.560]  they just have like a traditional display behind them. But then at certain times, they use the
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.040]  floor and the ceiling too. I've never seen anything quite like it was pretty, pretty interesting.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.000]  But they unveiled a bunch of new high end phones, all of them at the high end.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:32.000]  And, you know, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. And I don't want to look at it through to Apple
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.040]  a focused lens. But it's very strange to me that they introduced the ones that people are supposed
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:46.000]  to buy are the the the galaxy s 10 models, of which there's three, there's the s 10, e,
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:54.400]  which is smaller 5.8 inch diagonal. But also, it's $750. So it sort of competes against the iPhone
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:00.640]  10 R, but also is missing, you know, like the 10 R doesn't have as many cameras as it's more expensive
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.080]  brethren doesn't have the cool new in screen fingerprint sensor, you have to actually touch
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:14.560]  the side button to get a fingerprint sensor. The s 10 is 6.1 inches, and has a bunch of features.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.240]  And then there's the s 10 plus, which is 6.4 inches. So they're the three phones that people
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:26.240]  will buy, and Samsung should be hoping to get people talking about, but they couldn't help
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:34.720]  themselves and also showed the the galaxy fold, which is a folding tablet that folds up to a
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:43.520]  ridiculous looking. Who is that? It's like a Homer Simpson phone. And I don't mean to be rude. It's
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:49.200]  just like I, I'm sure I mean, it actually looks technically very impressive. And as I recall,
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.760]  journalists were not allowed to get hands on time with it after the event. No, so the only time
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.680]  they're supposed to ship in April, or they're taking orders in April, or they should, I don't
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.320]  know, it seems fishy to me that they're not taking orders. And there's a lot of people have a lot of
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.040]  questions about the hinge on this, like the, the display is in indisputably cool, you know that the
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.200]  inside display. Yeah, it's very interesting. And they're like, you know, last for thousands of
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:18.160]  foldings and unfoldings, which I imagine is enough. It's got some very clever gears. And
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:24.080]  yeah, but how, how, what does that how does that how durable is that hinge? How sturdy is it? When
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:30.240]  it's open? How hard is it to close? I mean, there's a lot of ways I can go. And, you know,
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:37.440]  you know, the other display the one that you see when it's the phone is in closed mode is
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:43.840]  ridiculous. It's only 4.8 inches on a giant device. And so it has like these preposterous
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:52.720]  chin and forehead like it's clearly intended to be used open in the full size mode. And then yeah,
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.880]  that that closed cover is there. So like if your phone buzzes, you can like look at it and see what
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.800]  you know, why, why is my phone buzzing? Oh, I see. It's, you know, a phone call from Glenn or,
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:08.240]  you know, I've got email from so and so. But it's not like a one line display. I mean,
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:13.760]  the cover is like a high resolution display that would be just a phone on another phone.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:19.440]  Right. Except which is 4.6 inch phone on the front that another could just be different.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:24.400]  It's funny. I keep laughing every time I look at it. It's not that it's ridiculous. I mean,
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:29.120]  you know what I also remember was the part member of the palm folio? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. The external
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:33.840]  device for your palm, which was like a little laptop. And I, but my sense was like, well,
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:38.560]  I got a phone and then I got another thing. Do I really want the other thing or do I want that?
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:44.160]  Like, what, what is my purpose? Again, I go back to the job. What's the job for? But it's like,
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:51.520]  do I really want to, is being able to fold something up instead of putting it in a sleeve
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.960]  that critical to me as a differentiating factor that's worth like a thousand dollar premium?
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:04.560]  Well, do you watch Westworld? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So the Westworld people have tablets that fold,
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.760]  you know, that everybody's uses the same type of device and you can fold it up to be phone size,
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:15.680]  or you can unfold it to make it bigger. But when you fold it, it, it doesn't really get that much
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:21.920]  that much thicker. You know, it's, it's very, very thin. You know, and obviously it's, you know,
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:28.240]  that's science fiction, but it doesn't seem that preposterous, you know, and it seems like that's
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.800]  what you want. So that when the people on Westworld are using it without unfolding it
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:38.480]  to tablet size for a quick interaction, it's not a preposterously thick device that looks like it
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:43.440]  has a giant thick hinge. It still is very thin and that's what they can put in their jacket pocket or
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:48.560]  pants pocket or something. So it's nice, nice and tidy and folded up, but still a very usable device
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:53.040]  as a phone size held in one hand device. Yeah, it's the same, but that's because the
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.320]  resolution and intent are the same. Whether, I mean, this is a low, a smaller screen on the front
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.520]  so that it's not useless when folded up and the actual product is inside. So the front is intended
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:09.600]  to be a little thing you use, but then, so how often will you switch between it? Have you seen
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:14.640]  the Expanse, that TV series? No, I have not seen that. I just shotgunned season two and three,
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.000]  which are great, but they have the communicator there. They're different size ones, but a lot of
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.480]  them are a handheld thing, like a phone size thing with a clear display and it actually
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:30.960]  holographically gets bigger. So when you're holding it, stuff appears around it, hovering
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:35.520]  around it at the same 2D plane. I was like, Oh, you know, I don't know how feasible, like I don't,
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:40.640]  I mean, it's a very clever idea, but it's physically the size of a phone often. And
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:45.360]  the display is just essentially effectively moves beyond the boundaries of the thing.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:48.800]  And I'm like, that feels like what Samsung's trying to do here is they're trying to give
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:53.680]  you the sense that it's a single device with two kinds of resolutions, but instead it's kind of a
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:54:01.760]  chunky device, but it's, it's just two things. I mean, the foldable OLED display is a real thing.
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:07.360]  It is very cool, but it is clearly a demo. It's a prototype at this stage. And it's like the old
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:12.400]  Steve jobs thing that, you know, you've done dozens of stories like this, where he had a very
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:18.560]  keen sense of that's not a product that's a feature, you know, that's, or that's a technology,
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:26.000]  right? Just how hard is it to put an iPad or a tablet in a sleeve? Well, or your back, it's not,
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.160]  but it wouldn't be in your pocket. It would be cool to have something that was thin enough
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:37.360]  that if it was phone-sized while pocketable and unfoldable to be, or stretchable or something to
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.400]  be bigger when you needed it. I like, I'm sure we'll, we will get that. We'll get that, you know,
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.120]  it, you know, I don't know if it's 10 years out, five years out, I don't know, but we'll get
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:50.560]  something like that. But this, this is not it. Like,
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.880]  I do respect their interest in making something that is technologically well ahead of its time.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:03.600]  They're pushing the price envelope. It's clearly got a crazy number of features in it. So it's not,
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:10.640]  they're not skimping on this. This isn't a bad product. Like, Oh, my God, everything is hard.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.080]  Look, ah, it's terrible. It's more like, I'm mystified about it. But I can't say it lacks
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.240]  ambition. And that's neat. I mean, I know they're a multi-billion dollar company, and they shouldn't
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.760]  be doing things that are so risky, they can lose the farm on it. But after the events the last few
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.080]  years and various executives being indicted and some sent to prison and then released and all
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:35.040]  this other stuff going on, the fire, you know, their phones bursting to flames. Maybe they need
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:40.240]  to do something that is over the top. Maybe it's not successful. But it's interesting. It's
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.560]  provocative. We'll see if there's a market for it. So I do have that to say, which I think is
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.160]  pretty positive. I think I'm intrigued that the starting price is $1980. You know, I don't know
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.920]  how far that goes that they're a little sketchy on details, especially for something that's
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:59.360]  supposedly shipping in April. But I really do think that that's interesting. And, you know,
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.640]  I wrote before the iPhone 10 came out when there were rumors that it was going to be more expensive
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:10.880]  that I would like to see Apple make a $1500 iPhone and see what they could come up with. Like, I
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:17.680]  dispute the notion that the highest price iPhone should be priced for everybody and that it should
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:24.880]  never go above 600 $700 like it was 10 years ago. Because I feel like phones have become too
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:30.720]  important to people that they've they've grown in importance. And, you know, we've had $2,000
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:38.080]  laptops for years. I mean, it used to be, you know, laptops for five $6,000. And there's I
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.320]  know, a lot of people personally who their most used most important computing device is their
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:49.840]  phone. So why not have one that costs 1500 or $2,000 and justifies it on technical grounds?
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:55.120]  Sure. You know, if that's your most important device. So, you know, it's interesting to see
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.600]  somebody jump so far ahead of Apple in terms of highest starting price for a smartphone.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:05.840]  But I don't, I don't see this as being I mean, who knows, I could be surprised and maybe it'll
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.720]  come out and be well reviewed. But it looks awfully thick. And they seem to go to great
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.720]  lengths to disguise it in closed form. And seems very awkward in closed form.
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:20.480]  Yeah, they're holding it when you all the photos I was trying to you I saw you commented how thick
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.360]  it was. I looked at a lot of photos of this thing. And every picture appears to be so they can show
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:31.520]  it in as 2d planar relative to the camera as possible. And I don't I don't blame him for it.
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:36.800]  But you know, and there is an obsession within like if this thing, again, this is I love the
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:41.760]  idea that a company is exploring something at the edge of what's possible. That doesn't look like a
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:47.520]  technological failure. We'll find out when it hits the market if it actually succeeds, but they're
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:53.040]  trying something so far on the edge, the question will be, will the potential audience for this be
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:57.360]  big enough to be worthwhile? And if so, does the thickness matter for the first release? I mean,
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:01.600]  we remember the first iPad, it was kind of ridiculous. Like, I look at a I have an iPad.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.600]  I don't know which version I've had to, we still have that works. And it seems absurd to me. It's
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.560]  so big and thick and weird. I'm like, Oh, my God, this is what we used to have. And that's seven
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.960]  years old, eight years old now. So maybe this is the first version. And it has enough utility that
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:23.920]  it drives a new market segment, Samsung gets people to pay 2000 to $2,500 or more for this
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:30.800]  thing. And it sparks a huge investment and drive to make foldable displays. And their next
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:38.640]  one is, you know, 30% thinner in a year. But but I mean, this is, it's not a, it's not an absurd
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.360]  idea, like some other ideas in the past have been absurd. No, but I think it's interesting idea,
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:47.360]  maybe too early. I think it's a very interesting idea that has a lot of future. But I feel like
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:53.440]  this particular implementation borders on the absurd and might might when we find out more
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:59:02.160]  that yeah, it might I, and I just I just question their decision. To me, it's a lack of corporate
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:07.760]  institutional discipline to be able to say we could build this now we have this we've we've,
[01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:13.520]  you know, they've created this foldable OLED technology that you can fold up and when unfolded
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.040]  has no ugly crease or seam in the middle. That is cool. There's no doubt that that is cool
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:23.760]  technology. But it just seems to me like the fact that they have this technology, they just couldn't
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:28.560]  stand not putting it into a product, whether it's ready to be a product or not. Whereas the
[01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:34.240]  discipline and I think something that Apple historically has done very well is to have that
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:39.360]  discipline and say, Okay, this is cool technology, but this isn't a good product yet. So we wait and
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:43.520]  we keep our mouth shut and go back to work and turn it into a good product.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.200]  I also don't want to overemphasize this, but we shouldn't under emphasize that Samsung is,
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:55.600]  I was alluding to before they've gone through, you know, an amazing amount of of criminal
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:03.360]  accusations or trials to come. The Who was it? One of the CEO was put in jail. Yep. And then released
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:08.720]  on a suspended sentence. So like the company, it's actually shocking that it's not in more disarray,
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:12.720]  because so many of the executives have been swept up into this and it's had to take their attention.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:16.640]  So there is a little bit of it when you say, you know, have they been exercising corporate
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.560]  discipline? I'm like, I don't even know how they function, given all the rest of what's going on.
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.320]  So they are shipping new devices. And they did were able to move on from the,
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:28.320]  the burst into flame thing, which is really difficult to recover from.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:34.320]  Yeah, which happened with phones that they put really, really big batteries in and,
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.280]  and was a disaster for the company. Yeah, they seem to have confidence in that now,
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.000]  because a lot of these phones, if they one thing that they'll brag about that Apple never mentions
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.320]  is the mega amp hours of the batteries. And Oh, yeah, some of these phones that they announced
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:56.480]  yesterday have like 4000 I swear like 4000 4600 I think one is 4600 mega amperes. So they seemed
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:00.000]  they seem to have recovered from the burst into flame. They seem to have confidence.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.160]  You can't squeeze it. That was the problem. You can't you can put a big battery in,
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.120]  you just can't cram it in. So sealed, it's under pressure. The other phone they announced yesterday
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.960]  and this one is even it's crazily enough even even more vapor wear ish than the foldable one
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:22.640]  is the s 10 5g. Yeah, yeah, which again, it like why would you announce that now? Well,
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:27.440]  clearly because they want to be able to scream we were first, right? We're the first 5g
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:34.320]  flagship phone. I, I didn't even pick this up in the in the data. I read this this morning
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  that they haven't even said. They haven't said what it will cost. They've said it will come
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:44.480]  to Verizon first in the US and they had Verizon CEO come out and wearing a t shirt which I thought
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:52.640]  was I thought was weird to do the T mobile CEO thing I guess. Yeah. He came out and but no price
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:59.040]  and no date. They didn't haven't even really said that it's going to come out in 2019. First half of
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.160]  first half 2019 is the promise but yeah, you know, you know, let's see if it actually comes out.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:08.240]  And that's another one where I don't. And the funny thing is that the guy for Samsung who
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:13.120]  introduced it, I don't remember his name, but he was some something, you know, VP of product
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:19.280]  marketing. He said something to the effect of, you know, he was like going through the history of
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:23.600]  cellular networks where there was the original data network and we had text messaging, right?
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.200]  We had 2g which which made email and other stuff possible. And then 3g was a breakthrough that
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:34.480]  really kind of made the mobile, you know, doing the web on mobile devices was possible. And then
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:38.640]  we had 4g, which, you know, made everything, you know, blah, blah, blah. And he said, every step
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.280]  of the way, the first generation of phones that supported these networks were too big and thick
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.160]  and heavy. You know, also, well, this is the end of that. But then the next thing he says is,
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:58.320]  here's the s 10 5g. And it has a 6.8 inch screen. It's, it's almost as big diagonally as the foldable
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:05.760]  one when it's unfolded. It's so much bigger than the other s 10 phones. Like, so he's just said,
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:10.800]  like, how can you introduce it by saying every time the first the first phones to support a new
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:17.600]  networking technology were too big. Here's a seven inch phone. Like, although, well, but too big is
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:24.000]  always code for too thick, right? Maybe it's not thick. I don't know. But it seems to see his plate
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.240]  again, seeing it in a plane view, it's it's, it's a perpendicular to the plane of viewing. So I can
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:39.840]  only see how wide it is. I missed it. It's 4500 milliampere hours in the 5g s 10. The 4100 milliampere
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:45.120]  hours in the s 10 plus, which is great. That's tons of tons of power. But then you ask for 4500.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.520]  Do you need that in order to support the 5g chips? I don't know. But I mean, this is the other thing
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:56.960]  is cellular networks have gotten ridiculously more power sensitive or power efficient for
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.320]  as the data rates gone have gone up, they become much more efficient relative to throughput. So
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:09.680]  that issue usually is backed off. I just seems maddening to me. And if I had been at Samsung
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:17.120]  and worked on the s 10, regular models, yeah, I would be so mad to see them debut alongside
[02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:27.760]  this 5g model, which you can't really promote 5g without implicitly slagging. 4g, right?
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.920]  4g doesn't, you know, I still get maintain 4g doesn't exist. Because when 4g was first or an
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:39.280]  LTE was first announced, and then 4g sort of got lumped into being LG LTE, the data rates were
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:44.400]  supposed to be like 100 megabits per second to a gigabit per second downstream, we still don't have
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:48.560]  those networks. There's some there's some around the world that have them. So our 4g networks 4g
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:54.240]  LTE are really, they just you know, what they do is they redefine the stamp, the name to fit
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:59.840]  whatever got built. And remember that got done early. So the 5g networks, nobody knows why they
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:05.760]  want 5g. No, it's a carrier thing, right? It's a total carrier thing. And they're already playing
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:13.040]  games with it. Is it AT&T, who's already trying to get the 5g label like on existing phones,
[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:17.760]  like yeah, it's gonna show up as if it were, it's like can have a little extra thing. And I mean,
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.640]  it's it's sadly, everything's been marketing. I mean, 3g was a distinctly different technology,
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:28.240]  there was 2g and sort of two and a half g, and 3g. And then what they're calling 4g was more like
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:34.400]  three and a half g was like an advancement of 3g technology. 4g did have a, there's a fundamental
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:39.840]  change, you know, 4g is the evolution to an all IP phone network. So there is a fundamental change
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:46.480]  in it. That's how you get voiceover, or high definition voice was a voiceover LTE calling
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.920]  and things like that. Like so there's a fundamental evolution in the underpinnings of the
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:54.480]  network is a better network, it's more efficient, it's higher throughput, you get better coverage,
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:59.840]  it supports more in different kinds of frequencies, there's better OFDM sub channelization,
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:04.080]  like all these technical bits, that mean you can get better performance, and the carriers can roll
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.080]  at higher and higher speeds, and they can use freak more, more in different frequencies. So you
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:13.200]  have the base bands and the phones are ridiculous in the number of frequency ranges they support
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:18.480]  within one country or worldwide. All that's great. But the 5g thing is like ours is 1g faster. I
[02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:22.720]  mean, Trump tweeted today, you saw this, right? No, I did not. I was at the doctor, remember?
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.320]  We needed to be the first to deploy 5g and even 6g networks.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:31.920]  Of course, of course. Of course he did. That's the way his mind works immediately.
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.680]  He has no idea. He has no friggin idea what any of this means. And of course,
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:39.440]  he's the best marketing person, right? He's like 5g is clearly one better.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:46.320]  Right. And 6g, like we're so far away from widespread employment. Of course he wants
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:51.440]  6 or 7g. But isn't that great? I mean, it is like a parody to you. I want 5g and even 6g
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:54.560]  technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful,
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:58.320]  faster and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:03.760]  or get left behind. I just ran the speed test app here on my phone. I turned off Wi-Fi just to see
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.240]  what am I getting. I get pretty good Verizon service here in Philadelphia. I got just tested
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:16.160]  at 72.6 megabits per second down. 5.5 up. But usually, yeah, I'm in the basement as I record
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:19.840]  this. 25. Oh, that's great. I mean, the networks have gradually gotten faster getting to it. But
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:25.360]  it's like even if 100 megabits per second, the target was one gigabit per second if you were
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:29.760]  standing still, basically. And 100 megabits per second if you're driving 60 miles an hour.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:36.800]  Yeah. And you know, the other thing and the one thing that Apple never seems to lose sight of
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:41.440]  is that it's the holistic experience, the whole experience of using the phone that matters the
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:47.440]  most. And of course, faster networking is better than slow networking. It controlled for all other
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:53.280]  variables, of course. And slower, you know, faster ping times are better than slower ping times. Of
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:59.040]  course, latency is, you know, it's not good. But battery life is an issue. Coverage cellular
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:03.600]  coverage is an issue. And what happens as you hand off from tower, you know, there's,
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:09.440]  it's the whole day long, weeks long, year or two year or three year long experience of using a
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:16.640]  phone that matters the most. And, you know, the 5G stuff is, you know, come on. It's such a carrier.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.320]  It's just the carrier's obsession with, well, that is their thing. And they would love for the most
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:29.440]  important thing in Jane Consumer, who's in the market for a new phone, to be most worried about
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:35.600]  the network as opposed to the device. Like, oh, you know, all they ever talk about is how great
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.640]  the network is. And you know what? All people want is for the goddamn phone to work and be fast.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.720]  And that's it. And I have gigabit internet at home. I've had it for, oh, and to have a bill,
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:50.960]  have a, have a bill that is like your $50 phone bill should be $50, not $75.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.400]  Yeah. But yeah, I, uh, I have a side gigabit internet and, uh, I've had it for years. And
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.560]  the thing you experience when you have a super fast network, uh, and it's, you know,
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.960]  and often we'll do speed tests. It'll be six or 700 megabits per second up and down. So it's,
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.160]  it's really, they're not lying. It's actually sort of gigabit. But the thing is, uh, the internet
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.560]  doesn't really run a gigabit speeds. Very few things can transfer anywhere near that fast. So
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:21.120]  there's a point at which really I get what the, what the, uh, carriers are saying when they say
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.040]  5g is so important. It's the next thing is they're saying what they should be saying. I think,
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:29.840]  and I'm not a marketing person is you're going to be able to get high definition streaming video
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.600]  wherever you are, whenever you want. And it's going to be part of your plan. You know, we're
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:39.200]  gonna have your 5g plan. You're going to be able to download any file, anything, download a five
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:45.360]  gig, download a high definition movie to your phone, uh, in, in, uh, five minutes. That's what
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:51.120]  5g promises. That's something that people could act upon. And it's a, it's something that tells
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.280]  you something. The same 5g is faster. It's because they don't know they can't promise anything for
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.520]  them. There's great network improvements they'll get out of it. And that's terrific, but it
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.080]  certainly doesn't, it doesn't translate into that. Um, you might, my great grandmother apparently
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:09.200]  used to say something along the lines of, you know, essentially, uh, so, so how rich do you need to be?
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.080]  Are you going to eat five meals a day? And that's what I feel about with 5g. It's like, how fast do
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:19.360]  you really need it? If you know, I only need, if I had consistent three or 4g speeds, it'd be great.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:23.200]  I don't need 5g. Right. And there's so many things. And I know 5g is meant to address this and,
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.480]  and each subsequent level of this of cellular networking technology has gotten better at it.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.160]  But for example, uh, one thing that would be more meaningful to me, way more meaningful may war
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.400]  frequently is when I'm in some place very crowded. I mean, I live in center city, so it's already
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:44.320]  pretty dense, but Manhattan is usually pretty dreadful for cell phone coverage, uh, or go to
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:49.200]  Disney world or something like that. Like being able to get the same speeds that I normally get,
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:54.480]  but get it when I'm amidst thousands of people or at a concert or a sporting event, right? I go to
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:11:00.160]  see the Sixers or the Yankees or something like that. And there's 50,000 people in Yankee stadium
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:05.520]  and they're all taking pictures of the same thing and trying to upload them or text them at the same
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:11.360]  time. If I got the same speed I normally got, but it worked better when 25,000 other people were
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:16.160]  using their phones at the same time. That's a meaningful upgrade, but it's 5g will, I mean,
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:22.720]  5g, uh, 802.11 ax the new wifi standard. That's starting to sort of roll out a tiny bit. I think,
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:29.280]  uh, that is all about how do you get a bazillion mobile devices to talk efficiently and better use
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.640]  all the spectrum that's available. And, and 5g has a lot of similar principles. It's there's
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:41.440]  tons of devices. We need to make sure we sh we can handle the load of micro cells, break it all out
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.480]  and just deal with the capacity. Cause what you're describing, I mean, Yankee stadium is not unique
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.960]  anymore. Like there's Yankee stadiums in every part of the country every day, uh, during commutes
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:55.520]  or in downtowns or wherever. So it's, it's a fundamental problem. And again, I think if they
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.600]  said 5g is going to be incredible because you could be, you know, they show somebody, they,
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:03.440]  they have John Gruber close tight up or tight shot on John Gruber. They pull back. John is in
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:08.000]  a stadium and he's uploading, you know, 4k video. And then you see everyone else is uploading 4k
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.920]  video and it's like 5g. That's what it offers. That's a great ad, right? I think I'm, I'm not an
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.120]  ad person, but that tells people something that frustrates them today that they'll be able to do.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:25.840]  Well, I I'm not, when, when do you, I there there's the, the Apple related note on 5g is that
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:33.760]  it apparently is caught up in their ongoing legal squabble with Qualcomm. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:41.600]  Where Qualcomm is like the leader or the only source for 5g stuff. But I don't think I Apple
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:48.560]  has been, you know, the, the original iPhone shipped when quote unquote, most smartphones
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:53.120]  were already on 3g and it wasn't 3g and it was like the number one knock against it.
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:13:00.320]  And it was fine. And the other phones went to LTE or quote unquote 4g, whatever they
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.960]  marketing wanted to call it. And the iPhone was at least a year late to that, you know,
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:12.800]  when the gadget sites had on daily basis had 4g phones. I, I think even if Apple's relationship
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:19.600]  with Qualcomm was hunky dory, I really doubt that this year's phone would be iPhone's would be 5g.
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:28.480]  It's just the nature of Apple to, you know, to not get on board quickly for scaling reasons,
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.880]  you know, because they, they don't, you know, they, they, it's not like they're going to ship
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.560]  a weirdo iPhone 5g in small quantities, like Samsung's doing with the S 10, they're going to
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:43.600]  do it for all of the flagships or they're going to wait. And, you know, the power efficiency thing
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:49.520]  is real that, you know, the early versions are not going to be as power efficient as subsequent ones.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:53.440]  And Apple tends to wait for the subsequent ones. Well, there'll be super power efficient because
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.960]  there won't be any 5g cell base stations out there. So it'll all be 4g using the previous
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.680]  power efficiency, but no, but I agree. I think Apple tends to wait for the networks to mature
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:08.240]  to a point that it makes sense for them to promote it as a technology because otherwise
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:14.000]  their customers are unhappy that they're not seeing promise, you know, speeds and 5g, you know,
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.040]  icons of the phone which makes sense. Cause why, why release 3g phone if the phone only says 2g
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.680]  on it all the time. Yep. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:30.960]  of this episode. Our good friends at Casper. Casper makes sleep products designed by humans
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:36.000]  for humans. Casper's products are cleverly designed to mimic human curves, providing
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.880]  supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies. Look, you spend one third of your life sleeping. I spend
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:45.440]  at least half my life sleeping, to be honest. I'll steal the joke. I saw it. There was an Amex ad,
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.520]  Tina Fey did where she, I don't know why people are buying that mattress. And she said,
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:56.080]  Tina Fey in the ad says, you spend two thirds of your life in bed and eat all of your meals there.
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:02.800]  So why not get a good one? And they looked at her like, what? I love sleeping though. I swear it is,
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:07.120]  it's, it's one of my favorite things to do in life. I say it all the time when I'm talking
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.320]  about Casper, why not get a great mattress? And they make really, really great mattresses and all
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:19.360]  sorts of other, uh, sleep related products like sheet sheets and comforters and pillows and all
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:25.040]  the fancy stuff you put on your bed. It's just great stuff there. They've got the original
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:28.640]  Casper mattress back in the old days. They only had one type of mattress, the original,
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:33.360]  and it's still there. It's still great. It combined multiple forms of supportive memory
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.600]  foam for a quality sleep surface, just the right amount of sink and bath bounce, a breathable
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:45.680]  design. So you stay cool all night long. Uh, they also offer now two other mattresses,
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:51.200]  the wave and the essential. The wave features a patent pending premium support system to mirror
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:57.280]  the natural shape of your body. The essential has a streamlined design at a price that won't
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:00.960]  keep you up at night. In other words, the essentials cost a little less, still a great
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:06.640]  mattress. The wave is sort of their deluxe model comes with the quote unquote white glove, uh,
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:11.760]  installation. All of them come in, uh, cause their memory foam, these mattresses, they come
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.920]  in these boxes that you can't believe there's like a queen or even a King size mattress in a
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:22.080]  box this small. Um, really it's worth buying one just to, just to open the box. It's a lot of fun.
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:26.960]  Uh, but they have all sorts of other products. Like they said, pillows, sheets, everything you
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:32.400]  need for a better sleep experience. And it's all affordable because Casper cuts out the middleman
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.960]  and deals directly to you. They've got the engineers who designed these mattresses.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:43.760]  They make them, they put all this stuff together and they ship them directly to you with no retail
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:48.240]  middleman in between. And how do you buy an internet mattress? How do you never tried it?
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.080]  You never even touched it. You never sat on it. You never jumped on it, bounced on it, whatever.
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:58.480]  They've got a hassle free return policy. You got a hundred nights risk free sleep on it for three
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:03.040]  months. And if you don't like it, they'll take it back. No questions asked. Give you all of
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.800]  your money back. They've got free shipping and returns in the U S and Canada. So even the return
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:15.040]  totally free. Don't like it. Send it back. Um, it's really great. A hundred nights. I've got,
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:20.320]  we've got a bunch of Casper mattresses here at the Casa del Gruber. We love them.
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.600]  It's a great product. They last for years. We've got one, but I think the one in my son's bedroom
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.520]  now it's been, we've had this mattress in the family ever since, uh, ever since Casper started
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:36.720]  sponsoring the show. It's like brand new. Here's the deal for you. 50 bucks towards select
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:43.600]  mattresses by visiting Casper, C A S P E R.com slash talk show, and just use that same code
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:50.640]  talk show. No, the just talk show at checkout and you'll save 50 bucks towards select mattresses.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.360]  That's the, and the special code is talk show. I have to tell you terms and conditions apply.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.560]  I don't know what those terms and conditions are, but they do apply.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:04.960]  Oh, what else? This is the real speed zone. We got a bunch of little things to talk about. You've got
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:08.720]  this in the show notes. I don't know what you're talking about. To be honest is Twitter's new
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:17.760]  threaded approach. Oh, have you not seen this yet? You know, Jack Dorsey, um, uh, Twitter's flooded
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:25.840]  with Nazis and fascists and abuse. And he's like, what if, what if we removed likes? That heart
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:30.000]  really bothers me. He says, what if we got rid of that? That would probably solve problems. What if
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.520]  we threaded and nested conversations? So it's easier to follow a conversation that would produce
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:40.320]  more understanding among people and less harassment and abuse. So yeah, they've, they're trying stuff
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:44.640]  and I haven't seen it yet. I've seen some screen captures, uh, but some people are apparently
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:48.640]  getting this rolled out in some, uh, early testing or if you click a link, I think it may show up as
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.200]  an option. I almost never used Twitter's own software. I just use Tweetbot for everything.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:57.520]  So I'm like in bizarro Twitter universe where this stuff doesn't, doesn't exist.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.480]  Yeah, it's funny. I have switched to, I use Tweetbot on my phone, uh, but I use Twitter
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:09.600]  on my Mac because I find it a better workflow. And there's some things you can see in Twitter.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.520]  There's some interesting statistics and things. Yeah. It's very, there's certain certain
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:18.800]  interactions. I've discovered Tweetbot won't show me some replies and Twitter will. So I go back and
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:26.160]  forth, but yeah, I shouldn't say I never use it. I have, I, there's magic powers that I get as a
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:33.840]  blue checkbox person that are, there's certain features. I have to say in my defense, I never
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:40.240]  asked for it. I got, I got my blue checkbox as a verified Twitter user in the, the aftermath of the
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.800]  Matt Honan hacking years ago where they, you were very early though. And you had a bunch of users
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:49.280]  early on, so they kind of went through and verified people who'd write and were subject
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:56.000]  to it. It seemed like, you know, yeah, I was at risk of being targeted in a way Matt Honan was,
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.360]  uh, you know, probably true. I mean, I think, I think Matt and my Twitter
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:05.920]  history and, and our background and the number, I'm sure algorithmically it was like, yeah,
[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:11.600]  this guy's, this guy's a target. But, uh, but anyway, I get, I get notifications that other
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:19.440]  people can't get. It's like, it's like a level of notifications of tweets I might find interesting.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:24.000]  Like I can't turn on every time somebody likes my tweet because I'd get too many. I have too
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.720]  many followers, but I have the option of only seeing it for people who I follow. I forget.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:32.480]  There's yeah. Yeah. There's a great, some of those are, I have a blue check mark. So I see some of
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:37.040]  those and some though they've now rolled out to everybody that used to be exclusive. Like, so
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:43.200]  there's, so I have, you can say, don't show me like people who haven't confirmed a phone number
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:48.640]  or people who have changed their default avatar. There's a few of those I found when, um, back when
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:53.520]  uh, Eric Trump responded angrily to me about something and my Twitter was, yeah, I know this
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:57.120]  is my kids are still, this is how I impressed my children. They were very happy about that.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:04.480]  Um, and my tweet mentions were, were a trash fire in Tweetbot, which can't use Twitter filtering.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:10.720]  It can only accept the raw API timeline. I went into twitter.com and I turned on a couple of those
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:16.320]  boxes. So I was like, don't show me notifications from people who haven't changed their default
[02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:21.040]  avatar. And all of a sudden, like there were thousands of people tweeting at me for like two
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.800]  days solid. And I saw like two of them because everybody else was, and I also had low quality
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:32.160]  filter enabled. So the thing is most people who engage in abuse and whatever have not done the
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:37.760]  basics or they, uh, follow very few people or they only tweet at people who don't follow them
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:42.160]  and Twitter will read those signals. So if you check the right tech check boxes and you use a
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:46.400]  Twitter client, you wind up with a lot less noise. So most of the time Tweetbot is great. It's just
[02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:52.560]  when I, there's a flood of response. Um, I tweeted something the other day about Seattle. The Seattle
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.880]  times runs this regular feature, uh, X restaurants open and X closed. And the other day they had a
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:02.800]  headline like 43 restaurants open in Seattle 19 or closing. And I tweeted the 43 saying the hellhole
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:07.600]  that Seattle has become, or the, you know, the devastating nightmare we live in with the high
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:11.760]  minimum wage we passed. And people found that funny. So got thousands of retweets of it and
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:15.200]  whatever. And all of a sudden I'm like, Oh, and I wound up having again to use Twitter because I
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:19.520]  couldn't cope with the flood of stuff coming in. And then I got back to tweet. I got one like that
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:25.040]  in the last year where there was some, one of these incidents with, with gun violence and,
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:31.120]  Oh yeah. And I tweeted, uh, impetuously something to the effect of, to somebody I wasn't, it wasn't,
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:35.840]  it was like an app. It was a reply or something. And I just wrote something about, we're going to,
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:40.160]  we're going to take away your guns. I don't know. That's not even my politics. I'd actually don't
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:46.400]  support taking away lawful gun ownership. Uh, but somebody, I don't, I've never even figured
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:51.440]  out who retweeted it, but somebody with a large number of conservative followers retweeted it.
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:57.600]  And I, my, my Twitter mentions garbage for like, and I thought, you know what? I shouldn't have
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:01.200]  tweeted that. I actually, and I was like, this is what I get. I actually felt like this is my
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:06.800]  punishment. I can't use Twitter. You know, it's like, but like 72 hours later, it was still like
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:14.800]  three whole days later, it was still, uh, uh, a fire hose of garbage. Uh, I know exactly who
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:19.280]  retweeted you and I'm not going to say their name yet because they do this. They actually have a
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:24.480]  little, they're a prominent conservative who used to be somewhat reasonable. And, uh, there are
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.080]  plenty of reasonable conservatives. I have friends who are conservatives. I'm not playing some kind
[02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:32.480]  of political thing. There are people who exist to be trolls who happen to be conservatives,
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:38.080]  just like there are liberals. This guy went from an interesting thinker to a troll and he's can be
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  very cruel and nasty. I had to block him because I would tweet something very anodyne or very normal
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:50.240]  and he would retweet it with comment and his, and I would get, but he's also got a little bit
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:55.200]  of an intersection with, uh, with the Mac world. So I think, uh, or has an interest in it. So he
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:59.440]  follows people like you and me. Um, that's as opposed to, there's a, a fellow who I'd say is
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.320]  like the exact opposite as Brad DeLong, who's a well-known economist, a very thoughtful person,
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:08.800]  does not engage in trollery. And he's like the inverse of this other guy. It's also, I follow
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:16.400]  Brad DeLong. Also, uh, Brad DeLong, long time during Fireball Reader actually. I've read his
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:22.000]  stuff for years and years and years. Uh, and the other thing that I run into, and I think even like
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  in that gun thing that people think it's me is they, they conflate me with Jonathan Gruber,
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:35.520]  the MIT economist who is the quote unquote architect of Obamacare. And, but he generally
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.640]  goes by Jonathan. And I realized that a lot of people don't realize that JOHN is almost never
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:46.720]  a Jonathan. You know, it's something that we Johns know, like Moltz and I will go on at length about
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:52.160]  it. If you're a JOHN, there's only, I've only met like a handful of JOHNs who were actually Jonathan's
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:59.600]  JON is the diminutive form of Jonathan. And that's who the Gruber who's the Obama architect is.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:05.920]  But when that whole thing erupted five, six, seven years ago about him saying something
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:13.360]  pretty stupid on stage, the way it came out of his mouth that, that, that, that the people were,
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.000]  you had to kind of, I forget what he said, but it kind of insinuated that people are too stupid
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.280]  to understand what was good for them about Obamacare or something. Oh my God. But he's
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:28.480]  not on Twitter. And so a lot of people would guess, well maybe at Gruber is this guy and
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:34.000]  they'd see it's of somebody with a lot of followers. His name is John Gruber. And oh my God,
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.760]  did I get a lot of those? Oh my God. I used to write back to those people though at that time,
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:44.800]  I sometimes I would just have fun with them and just say like ridiculous, like under the guys.
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:51.840]  And I almost feel bad because I was, I never claimed to be the other John Gruber, but I would
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:55.840]  just write back to them and say ridiculous things like, you know, this is really just the first
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.840]  step. We're going to, you know, we're going to, we're going to have everybody get there.
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:02.400]  We're going to have everybody get their healthcare at the post office. And
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:08.480]  there's just something ridiculous like that. Like once we can get everybody on Medicare for all,
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.600]  we'll just put all the doctors in the post office and we'll save money. You know,
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:18.320]  we'll save tremendous amounts of money at the federal level. Oh my God. It was a lot of fun,
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:23.760]  but I have to, I try to avoid that now. Anyway, getting rid of the hearts on Twitter. That's the
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:29.280]  dumbest thing I've ever heard. We were talking about square earlier, Jack Dorsey's other company
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:35.600]  and he, he did a bunch of interviews a month ago. I forget why, but you know, it was making the
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:39.040]  media rounds. He did a really good interview on the bill Simmons podcast. You probably don't
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:44.320]  listen cause it's mostly a sports podcast, but bill Simmons did a tremendous job interviewing
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.320]  Jack Dorsey. I'll put this in the show notes. It's not sports related at all. I guess they
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:54.960]  touch a little bit on like NBA Twitter, meaning the subset of, of Twitter that's, you know,
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.840]  likes to talk about the NBA. Jack Dorsey is a big golden state warriors fan. Ah, okay. But one of
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:07.760]  the things that came up was the difference between square and Twitter. And he said this in a couple
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:13.040]  interviews, not just with bill Simmons, but he said something to the effect of, we have to be
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:18.160]  super careful about everything we do at square because it's money and people will get upset if
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:24.320]  we handle this wrong. And so many people had to came and me, I mean, I can't take credit for it,
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.600]  but everybody who listened to this had the same thought of, Oh my God, what if you did
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:37.200]  treat Twitter that way though? And just, you know, like, you know, what if you were as careful about
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:43.920]  what you allowed to happen on Twitter as you were on square? Like if we, what, if we charged a penny
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:50.400]  a tweet, you'd suddenly get rid of the Nazis. And this is what leads to regulation is industries
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.960]  accidentally confess that because they're not regulated, that they do anything they want. And
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:59.760]  people are like, Oh, well, I'm really not in favor of regulation. But now that you said that
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:03.920]  we don't do any experiments, it's square, you know, like this whole like, well, what if we
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:11.040]  let Nazis have, you know, a platform, I have to highlight this thing. There's a thing that
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:17.120]  Pinterest did. Pinterest has been actually trying to create, like more sensible communities in a
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:22.560]  way that YouTube and others are not and Twitter are not. And what they said is, I saw this
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:29.040]  formulated just today was there's freedom of speech, not freedom of reach. So yes, there's
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:33.120]  a bunch of forums in which you should be allowed to say whatever you want, but you're not allowed
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:40.240]  to, you're not given the right to a platform, especially a privately owned one. So there's
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.760]  people trying to suppress your ability to speak in public fora. And that's unconstitutional. And
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:50.000]  there's issues about whether it's hate speech and inciting violence and all that. But it's like,
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.280]  there is no right on Pinterest to have access to Pinterest audience, right? So I think Pinterest
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:59.920]  now like, we came up with the anti vac stuff. It's not that you can't pin anti vacs things
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:04.320]  on your own board, but you can't promote them in the way that you can in other platforms.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:10.080]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I saw the same thing. I hadn't read it, but I knew that it was gonna, you know,
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:14.960]  tie back into a topic we talked about earlier in the show that was an anti vaccination thing and
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:22.560]  that they've taken concrete steps to keep that anti vaccination. Honestly, I feel safe describing
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.680]  it as disinformation from spreading at the scale that pit that stuff can spread on Pinterest because
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:33.520]  they realize it is collectively not it's against the interests of society at large.
[02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:38.960]  Trenton Larkin Yeah. I was just I just read a story to somebody dug it up. It was like on
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:44.880]  the 50th anniversary of Jonas Salk's polio vaccine getting approved. And like the time it was like,
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:52.080]  they just talked about how it was it was like another, you know, VJ day or V day, you know,
[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:56.000]  you know, it was like a day when people like went out in the streets to celebrate and
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:02.000]  party on New Year's Eve because it was, you know, and you know, I don't know anybody I don't.
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:06.240]  I realized that our generation like me and you like, I don't know anybody who had polio
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:12.560]  of my peers, but my family, you know, like my, my, my grandparents did by my mom's dad had a
[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:18.320]  brother who I think died from polio. I mean, I don't know any, I mean, it was, you know, it,
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:24.080]  it was crazy, you know, I mean, your kids could get measles, and maybe they die. And it was
[02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:28.320]  nothing you could do about it because they were going to get it, you know. And then all of a
[02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:32.880]  sudden, yeah. And then, you know, this terrible disease that even if you survived it, you know,
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:37.840]  would could leave you, you know, severely handicapped for life, you know, we, you know,
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:42.960]  we've got a thing, we can just give this to every kid, and they'll never get it. And science backs
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:47.280]  it up, you know, the largest clinical study at the time that anybody had ever conducted,
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:52.480]  and it was conclusive that, you know, this, this is going to work. It was great. And I just can't
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:56.800]  imagine, like, so many of the people who are of that generation are, you know, because of their
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:00.400]  age, they're gone now. But if you could just listen, if you could, they could just come back
[02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:08.000]  here and slap some sense into people, like. There's a great book I read a couple years ago
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:13.680]  called Get Well Soon by Jen Wright. She's Jen Ashley Wright on Twitter. Incredibly funny and
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:18.560]  wonderful person. And the book is A Hilarious Account of History's Worst Plagues. It's written
[02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:23.680]  in a very friendly and delightful manner. And she recounts all of it. It's really, it's very
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:30.400]  interesting. It's much more approachable, because it's not this deadly, either dry or horrifying
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:33.600]  thing. And she has kind of a little bit of a doo doo doo doo tone about it, which lets you get
[02:31:33.600 --> 02:31:39.120]  through it. But it is, it gives you some insight into what the scope of things we used to go
[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:46.400]  through. And then terrifying things like the 1918 flu that killed so many people, and we still don't
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:50.560]  know exactly why or if it would recur in that form, and whether we have any way to protect
[02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:55.840]  against it. But it's, I think it's a great, I don't know, I really, I really enjoyed reading
[02:31:55.840 --> 02:32:01.520]  about plagues. But it just lets you see the scope of what's happened across human history and what
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:06.320]  we've managed to avoid for, you know, 60 something years, 70 something years for the most part.
[02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.560]  Trenton Larkin All right, the lightning round continues.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:15.200]  The Big Hack, Bloomberg's blockbuster story from I think it was October, maybe November.
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:22.000]  I keep doing the thing where every time I mentioned a report from Bloomberg,
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:27.520]  or Businessweek, I put an asterisk in right away and then include a boiler net now boilerplate
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:34.800]  footnote, remarking that Bloomberg has since since that's published, offered no evidence backing up
[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:41.120]  their story, but yet have not retracted the story, which to me, is an untenable position,
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:46.320]  they either need to retract it, or show further evidence that no, we were right all along. And
[02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:50.080]  everybody else who's tried to back this up and hasn't found any evidence of it whatsoever,
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:54.640]  of any of the crap that we said happened, happened. And that, you know,
[02:32:56.640 --> 02:33:00.000]  I don't get it. I had more conversations with people after that story came out. And,
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:05.280]  and since when it comes up, you know, usually like off the conversation with other journalists,
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:09.280]  we're just chatting or, you know, sometimes publicly on Twitter, sometimes privately,
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:13.520]  and we're all just like, I don't, I don't understand it. Because Bloomberg has high
[02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:20.480]  journalistic standards. I don't suspect them or any of the reporters of engaging in, in a fraud
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:27.200]  or fabulism. And yet, this is a ridiculous story. And no reporter has managed to match it. And
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:34.080]  there's no way that Bloomberg had the only access to the large number of people. And after the story
[02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:40.560]  came out, some sources, as you know, even said, this isn't exactly what was going on. So it does
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:45.040]  feel like the story is wrong, and they don't understand it's wrong. And I can't believe
[02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.200]  they don't understand it's wrong. It seems like they dug themselves into such a pit,
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:54.160]  and they got such pushback both from the companies profiled and other journalists and
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:59.440]  experts in the field, that they just didn't know what to do about it. The thing I'll say this is
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:05.120]  closest to is the Guardian wrote a story is two years ago, about WhatsApp. And they talked about
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:10.000]  a remember this, yeah, a technical flaw. And at the end, I think like 150 computers or security
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:14.240]  experts wrote a letter to the Guardian urging them to retract it. And I still think it took
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:19.520]  them six months to essentially rewrite the story. I'm not even sure they fully retracted it. It was
[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:25.520]  just it was in error. I mean, it wasn't totally wrong. But the way in which they describe the
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:30.880]  scope of the problem was totally inaccurate. It was shocking, given the Guardian's normal
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:37.200]  technical coverage. So I don't understand. There's something so wrong here. I'm sure. So what I'm
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:41.440]  good guarantee you, john is there are people researching the Bloomberg side of the story,
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.800]  not at Bloomberg, who are going to write a remarkable 10,000 word story that is going
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:51.280]  to explain how what Bloomberg did wrong here. Yeah, it's it has to come out eventually. But
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:57.600]  I like to keep reminding people of it, because it is it's too long. And I really do feel like
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:01.920]  Bloomberg's goal is let's just hope everybody forgets about this, because we don't want to
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:06.880]  bring this up again. It's the it's the word like, and of course, you know, we both cover Apple and
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:10.560]  write and like Apple stuff. So it sounds like this is I never always like to say, I'm not defending
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:16.240]  Apple here, Apple defended itself very well, or Amazon or the other companies affected by it. But
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:23.440]  it's more like, I haven't seen a story that had as many credible people involved in it. That is so
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:28.720]  obviously wrong as this one in I don't even remember the last one. That's if one ever
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:33.760]  approached this scope. I mean, there's plagiarists and fabulous, but they were
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.400]  writing about stuff that wasn't very important. Yeah, the Theranos story is the closest one.
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:45.600]  But it's the flip side. It's like what Theranos was doing was as bad as what almost as bad as what
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:53.360]  Bloomberg was reporting on. Yeah, Theranos was true everything that was the other downside to
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:59.680]  this is the the boy who cried wolf aspect where the basic kernel of their story that the Chinese
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:06.320]  state was manipulating their access to this Chinese supply chain. Yeah, get stuff in all
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:13.360]  sounds plausible and very worrisome given the world's reliance on the Chinese supply chain.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:19.440]  And, you know, there's a lot of seemingly credible reports that Huawei in particular
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.840]  is really just a state owned front. And not just you know, like the US has banned Huawei phones
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:30.640]  from being sold on military bases so that you can't, you know, and they really don't have much
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:37.360]  of a presence in the US consumer market. Huawei also makes and speaking of 5g, they make Yeah,
[02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.680]  cellular networking technology, including 5g stuff. And that, you know, the US is taking steps
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:48.800]  to say, well, we, you know, legally, we're going to say we don't want their stuff, forming the
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.880]  backbone of the US 5g network, because we literally don't trust it. But as our countries
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:57.040]  around the world, so the US is saying that, and as our countries across Europe and elsewhere as well,
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:04.320]  right, and yet, you know, having this story out there of, hey, Chinese state,
[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:09.920]  intelligence services manipulating the supply chain. Oh, that was BS. Everybody says that was,
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:13.840]  you know, Bloomberg ran a story about it. It was BS. I'm sure this next one is BS. You know,
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.880]  like, yeah, there's a feels like disinformation. It's not. It's just something went terribly wrong.
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:23.760]  And I do believe we will, we will find out and I believe it's taken this long to find out because
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:27.920]  people are cracking sources inside Bloomberg and trying to figure out some of the external sources.
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:33.360]  And, and I expect we will get a big story in a Vanity Fair, or New Yorker magazine,
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:36.480]  or something like that. Not New Yorker, New York magazine.
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:41.120]  Yeah. And basically, the one thing I know, I, you know, I don't have good sources at Amazon,
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:46.960]  but I have sources at Apple. And basically, you know, they did Apple's, Apple's vehement
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:53.760]  defense was not a surprise to Bloomberg, you know, that they and there's only surprise really
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:57.840]  was that Apple did not expect them to publish the story when they did because they knew they
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:01.440]  were working on it. They had been asked for comment, they had been presented with, hey,
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:05.360]  presented with, hey, we were going to say x, y, and z, what do you have to say about it?
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.560]  And they had done, you know, they did, after the story came out, they redoubled into,
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:15.520]  let's do it all over again, and make sure that not there's not a just a truth to this, because my God,
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.320]  look at what they've wrote. But you know, they gave the adamant defense to Bloomberg,
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:25.440]  and so did Amazon before it was published and Amazon and Bloomberg's more or less was,
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:30.480]  oh, of course, Apple and Amazon are going to say that. And they really, really disregarded
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:38.320]  the plain strenuousness of their denials under the guise of publicly traded companies making
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:43.360]  statements that strenuous or that extreme, especially with Tim Cook saying it, he could
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:48.560]  go to jail for that if he were lying. It's not, it's not like he can say it and brush it off and
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:54.720]  executives have, it would be seen as manipulation of the stock price and it could be forced out as
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:57.920]  CEO and barred from serving publicly held companies, things like that.
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:03.520]  All right, another one. Here's a story you wrote, published on December 31. And criminally,
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.400]  criminally, I still haven't linked to it from during Fireball. This has fallen under the guise
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:12.000]  of something that happens at during Fireball, where I either linked to something when it's hot
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:16.880]  off the presses, or I file it away and think I'm going to link to that when I'm when I need
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:21.120]  something. And I've had that with this one in my back pocket. Now this is criminal because it's
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:25.840]  here we are. It's February 21. We just came out at a funny time. I forgot about that. Well, it
[02:39:25.840 --> 02:39:30.000]  was New Year's Eve, which isn't exactly great. But it's the old guard of Mac indie apps has thrived
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:36.720]  for more than 25 years. And you wrote this feature for Mac world on the ones I remember were BB Edit
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:47.680]  from bare bones and Peacock from James Thompson at TST no TLA TLA. Who else was in the story?
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:49.520]  Fetch, right?
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:54.800]  Fetch. And then also Lemke software's Thorsten Lemke graphic converter,
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:55.840]  graphic converter.
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:01.520]  Yeah. BB Edit put out a thing about, Hey, we have merch for our 25th anniversary. And I was like,
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.560]  Oh my God. And then of course, it's more than 25 years technically and whatever. And I I'm like,
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.600]  you know, it'd be fun to look back at this because I routinely every day I use graphic converter,
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:17.680]  BB Edit, Peacock every day. And I in some other software, I think that I use that some of it has
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:22.000]  been around for more than 25 years, but it's changed hands once or twice, but it's still
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.240]  developed. And I'm like, what are the indie, like indie developers? It's still a handful of people.
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:29.920]  Sometimes there were a lot more people in the company and then shrunk or some are very
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:35.760]  consistent all along. Like Thorsten Lemke, Thorsten Lemke is, um, it's mostly him now.
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:39.520]  And, uh, he has contractors who work in the past. I think he had a little more
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:44.400]  like full-time ish help. Uh, but this is software that is basically, I mean,
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.480]  you worked on BB Edit. It's, it's not the same piece of software, but it's kind of
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:55.280]  the, it, the intent is the same after a quarter of a century. And most of the people involved
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:59.760]  and the people involved are primarily making their living for it. I should say, uh, at Fetch,
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:03.440]  it's, uh, uh, Jim, uh, whose last name? I'm Matthews, Jim Matthews. Thank you,
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:07.840]  Jim Matthews, who won on, who wants to be a millionaire, the story of how he funded.
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.800]  All right. He was, he was a professor at, uh, Dartmouth. Yeah. He's on staff and he wrote this
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:16.320]  song. My dad calls me, he says, you've got to turn on who wants to be a millionaire. I said,
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:21.840]  why? He said, he said, Jim Matthews is on it. And I turn it on and I watch him make a very smart
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:26.640]  decision to stop because he didn't, he knew he didn't know the answer and walk away with a half
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:32.800]  a million dollars. Uh, so Jim Matthews, he now works for, uh, uh, the company that makes JIRA,
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:38.480]  um, uh, Atlassian. Uh, he's, uh, but he, so Fetch has become a little more of a side project. It's
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:42.720]  still developed. It's still updated, but it's no longer in the same kind of active forward motion,
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.320]  but I would still, you know, it's still out there and there's people who love it. And if you've been
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:51.520]  using it with FTP or SFTP, it doesn't support all the new cloud stuff in it. The way transmit does,
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:56.400]  uh, but it is still a piece of software that is totally up to date. It's ready for Mojave and it
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:02.160]  is a big part of his life for a big chunk of his life. Yeah. I, uh, I remember using it. It was
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:10.080]  before. So now I've been using, I was using Fetch back before the, um, there's like a standard open
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.520]  a apple event. I think it's the ODB editor suite. I forget what ODB stands for, but it's a way that
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:22.560]  you can set an FTP client like Fetch or Interarchy or transmit to say for this type of file, when I
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:28.080]  double click it, don't download it instead, open it and BBA and BBA that opens a temp file. And
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:34.800]  then when you save, all you have to do to, to, to make an edit is just save the file command S and
[02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:39.280]  then it sends the apple event back to your FTP client. And then your FTP client will update the
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:44.480]  version on the software. I was doing that before ODB even existed because I didn't want to use,
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:52.240]  I was so appalled by using Emacs or VI and a terminal window that I was editing my computer
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:58.320]  science stuff on a Unix system back in the nineties before this even existed, where I would just, uh,
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:03.920]  make a local copy, save it. And then I had to do one more step. I had to drag it back into the
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:08.080]  Fetch window and say, yeah, I hated that. Yeah. Overwrite, you know, do you want to overwrite
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:13.760]  the file? Yes. And so I was editing files, you know, on a remote server and BB edit before it
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:17.760]  even existed. And I was just thinking, you say transmit, I remember too. I think transmit
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.880]  came out. It's not quite, it's very, it's close. I looked it up. It's like 91.
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.760]  No, I think transmit was like 97 or 98. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm doing the math. So it'd be like 20
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:33.760]  years. Yeah. So there's, but it's really, I mean, I remember when so transit at 20 years old
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:38.800]  transmit, I'm using the originally remember the original name was transit and they ran
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:44.800]  panic. The cable and Steve ran into like a trademark conflict and they'd already built
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:51.520]  up all this Goodwill around the name transit as their name. And they had the truck icon already.
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:55.360]  And, and, and this great branding and they didn't know what to do because they're just two kids who
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:44:00.800]  were getting started. And, and then it like the, I forget who I've probably cable, but one of them
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:06.400]  came up with, well, what if we just call it transmit? And they realized not only is that
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:13.200]  verbally very similar, it starts with the same four letters. It actually fits their, their,
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:18.720]  the branding even better. It's actually the better word over the two. But anyway, I still think of,
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:26.880]  I still think of transmit as the upstart. It's the new FTP client, right? It's 20 years old and
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:32.240]  has been in constant development. But it's, it's the new one. And I use, I mean, graphic converter
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:36.720]  is my go to app partly because of its batch processing. I had to do something the other day
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:41.760]  with a, I was doing a take control book and I needed to do this thing where I was resizing it,
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:45.360]  make sure it was retina and the resolution and blah, you know, the usual thing. And I was like,
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:48.400]  yeah, I can write an Apple script. I could do automator. I'm like, no, no, no, no, wait,
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:53.600]  I just need to do a crack open graphic converter. And I do a batch thing in there. And I just am
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:58.560]  like drag and drop and click. And it's, it's just fantastically useful. I mean, it was built as a
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:04.560]  file conversion, you know, it's graphic converter and it supports, I forget what he's up over 200
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:11.680]  formats or something. And it's like, yeah, I had this idea. Well, at a time when most apps support
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:17.680]  the graphic files that the OS supports, you know, like graphic converter did all the hard work of
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.720]  actually having the native support for these formats built in. And that's why it has, you know,
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:28.320]  this list of formats that's well above and beyond what, what the system supports natively.
[02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:32.320]  Well, well, and I was having this conversation with my wife about something we'll talk about in
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:37.360]  a minute, which is putting something away archivally for centuries. And she was like,
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:42.480]  will someone be able to read this movie file that you're putting on a USB stick in hundreds of years?
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:47.680]  And I said, yes, I'm so confident because I won't be here, but it was partly because graphic
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:54.960]  converter, right? Like in 200 years, I will be able to run graphic converter and open like a 1960s
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:59.920]  image format in 200 years. There'll be, there'll be somebody like graphic converter for movie files
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:05.360]  as well. Like I'm not concerned for a non DRM protected files, but it is, is graphic converter
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:10.160]  that gives me the hope for the future that we'll still be able to like open Libre. If you need to
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:15.520]  open an Apple works file from, you know, version 1.0, I think open Libre has filters in it to open
[02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:20.000]  it in a moderate. Yeah, I had to do that. Someone asked for advice. They found a bunch of old disks.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.160]  I think that's the one. Um, but you know, if it's a straight, if it's just a conversion,
[02:46:24.160 --> 02:46:29.440]  it's an encoding thing, there's all the graphic converter. The joy of it is they don't have to
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:33.840]  change it. Like he wrote some formats in the nineties that are never, will never have to be
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:38.480]  changed. This has to upgrade the, you know, the frameworks that still work within the latest OS.
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:43.120]  But anyway, um, and what's funny is that I got email from some developers, nobody really liked
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.880]  that at a shape, but like, you know, I've been around for 25 like plum, amazing pop care. Uh,
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.360]  the, uh, the, uh, the thing that predated key caps, that's a, it's still being developed,
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:57.840]  same people. Um, and so I was like, you know, I can only fit so much in, you're totally awesome
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:03.200]  also, but I try to pick like four examples and whatever. And I'm like, I could probably write
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:08.640]  one that featured, that's the amazing thing to feel to say, maybe there's 15 pieces of max
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:13.680]  software developed by independent developers who are still working on it. Maybe sometimes part-time,
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:18.560]  maybe it hasn't advanced in a while, but it's still fully supported up-to-date 64-bit compatible
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:25.840]  already. Um, it's really cool. I love that. You know, it's funny. I remember pop care and,
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:30.720]  but I don't know that I've ever spoken about it with anybody in my life because in my mind,
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:37.600]  I've always said it pop char, even though I knew, I don't know. Even though I knew that the char
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:44.320]  stood for character, I've always, I think that it wasn't Pascal that used to have a char character
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:49.520]  type, like to the whole one letter. And I always thought of it as char, even though I knew it stood
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:55.760]  for character just because it made it, it, it's what I wanted to type. I think we said it char
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.280]  because if you said it was, if you said char, no one knew what you're saying, right? It was
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:05.760]  unambiguous to pronounce it as char. I think I called it pop care. Now that you say that,
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:10.320]  wait, pop care, pop chair. I don't know. It's funny. I don't think I've ever said it aloud.
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:15.280]  I used it back in the Quark express days when I was doing a lot of page layout, pop car was the
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:21.120]  most amazing thing. And over time I needed less because I don't have a specialized, uh, a need,
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:25.680]  but what an incredible thing this person has done. Um, and there's other stuff like suitcases still
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.360]  developed, but not by the same people. Uh, you know, it's gone through different hands and
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:34.400]  there's just, it's, it shows how much the community is committed to these developers,
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:37.120]  not how much developers are committed to what they've been doing. And you know,
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:42.560]  sometimes products get Sherlock or they, um, lose their necessity, but, uh, it's really,
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:47.520]  what a great thing. Yeah, it really is. Anyway, I will, I swear I'm going to link to it on during
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:52.640]  firewall, but I will also include it in the show notes. And then last but not least, as we wrap up,
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:58.240]  you are in the midst of, I think we got about a week, a week out. All right, well, that's good.
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:00.720]  This is the time to hit. This is the time to hit it. We're going to, we're going to,
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:05.120]  this episode should drop tomorrow. We'll have six days left, but you've got a Kickstarter
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:10.400]  going on. You've done a couple, you did a Kickstarter a year ago, two years ago for
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.680]  the letterpress book. I've been kind of doing them little by little. I've been, I've done,
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:22.800]  what have I done now? I've done seven and five have funded my last five in a row have funded.
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:27.760]  And it's not like I broke the code, but I did one for a letterpress book in 2017 when I had
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:33.520]  a design residency, which I essentially funded the costs. I did an edition of that and thank you for
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:37.760]  your participation in that. So now you have a copy now. It is one of the nicest. I mean this,
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:42.400]  not just because you're a guest on my show. It is one of the nicest books I own. It is,
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:48.720]  it is an artifact. And to me, as we rocket forward into an ever more digital future,
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.240]  and I spend so much more time reading stuff on screens, having an actual,
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:58.080]  and that's the only word I can think of at making an actual printed book, more of an artifact
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:04.720]  and something that appeals to senses other than your site, you know, just the feel of it is,
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.760]  is it's always been a nice thing. And I've always been obsessed with books, obviously not to your
[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:15.040]  degree, but, but I've always been obsessed with printed books and printing technology,
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.960]  but it's, it's really one of the nicest things that I own. I just so much it's, and it was,
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:25.280]  you know, is a massive amount of effort because I printed it on a essentially manual letterpress.
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:31.360]  The inking thing was motorized and that, so 2017 I had this residency and I, I printed the book,
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:37.760]  you know, I designed the book is digitally designed output to plastic rubbery plates that
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:42.000]  are then printed on letterpress was whole melding of old and new. And that year I went to the
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:47.040]  Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, north of Milwaukee on the lake
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:52.720]  for their Waze Goose, their annual confab where letterpress printers and type designers from all
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:57.760]  over the world come and had this great time at the end of the year, had this incredible year. And
[02:50:57.760 --> 02:51:02.480]  then this thing came up where Monotype calls me and says, you know, we're doing a revival
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:08.640]  of Five Typefaces by Bertold Volpe, who is, who died in 1989, who is my favorite type designer in
[02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:13.200]  the world. And I'm like, yeah, it was just this coincidence. They had no idea I had any interest.
[02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:17.840]  Do you want to write about it? Oh, and by the way, we have an exhibition we're underwriting in London
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:23.440]  of his papers and the original. And I'm like, Lynn, my wife, Lynn, how would you feel if I went
[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:29.200]  to London to a type exhibition? She's like, you go, go. And I wound up coming up with a book idea
[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:36.640]  and going to London and going to the exhibition and going to two type museums there that are
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:41.520]  barely open to the public. And I wrote a book called London kerning about those museums and
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:47.120]  sort of London type history. And that fed into this wacky thing I'm doing right now. So in the
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:52.640]  last two years, I've gone to four different type and printing museums, two in London, one in
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:57.520]  Portland, Oregon, this one in Wisconsin. And I've created this project called the tiny type museum
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:52:02.800]  and time capsule. This is my latest Kickstarter. And it's, it's basically like a little museum
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:10.000]  with genuine type artifacts. So it'll have metal type and wood type, it'll have some of the molds
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:16.080]  used to make hot metal, you'll be able to get a line of type slug. So a metal slug set on the old
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:21.520]  hot type settings, hot metal type thing system, used mostly by newspapers with your custom text,
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:26.480]  I'm doing a small letter press printed book that I'm not printing by hand, that if it raises enough
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:32.720]  money, I'll be able to have that set in hot metal and printed in line of type, probably in England
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:38.880]  with people I met on this last trip. And the idea is that I had this thought of like, there are
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:42.720]  there are a bunch of type museums around the world, many of them are sort of they're not open
[02:52:42.720 --> 02:52:47.440]  very much, or they're teetering financially, very few are well funded, some are funded by the state
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:52.880]  in Europe, or by there's a place called Tipoteca in Italy, that's funded by this family of printers
[02:52:52.880 --> 02:52:57.680]  for the printers for generations. And they've poured an incredible amount of money into this
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:03.280]  institution, I would love to go there, it's near Venice. But so this is a museum that you can own
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:09.440]  and hold that has actual pieces of type and printing history in it. And you get you as a as
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:14.880]  a backer of the Kickstarter, get your own personal tiny type museum. That's that's the that's the
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:19.040]  gimmick. Because I was thinking, I was thinking I should I had this thought after going to all
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:23.520]  these museums. I'm like, you know, none of them are nearby. I wish I had some resources myself.
[02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:28.320]  Maybe I should make a little museum for myself. I'm like, No, no, no, I should make a museum for
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:33.360]  other people. And so I have a friend who's a woodworker. She's taking cabinetry courses now,
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:37.920]  but she already is a fine woodworker. And she's kind of honing all her skills. And she and I talk
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:42.160]  about this. She's also a letterpress printer. And she worked at Glowforge, which is the 2d laser
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:47.360]  cutter company that's here in Seattle, a friend of mine founded. And, and so we're talking about
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:53.440]  this. And I'm like, you know, I could, you can make a box. And I could do huh. So she's designed
[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:58.880]  a prototype, and she's going to make these beautiful hand joined boxes that are going to
[02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:04.240]  last for centuries, like a little beautiful piece of woodworking with drawers, the book is going to
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:09.040]  slide into a slot in the case, we're going to hide something in the case, too, we're still working
[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:13.200]  out the details, there will be something hidden in secret in each case as well. And then there'll be
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:18.480]  two drawers, one will have sort of flat things. And the other will have metal and other objects.
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:23.920]  And it's exciting as to I sent email to Eric Spiekerman about it, he's like, one of the
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:27.600]  greatest designers in the world. He's like, this is very exciting. How can I help you? I'm like,
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:31.280]  oh, my, you know, it's like, all right, I had interviewed him. And, you know, kind of
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:36.000]  correspondence with him. He's like, let me send you some stuff. So I have some, some metal he sent
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.800]  me, he's like, we could print a postcard letterpress studio in Berlin. And so there's various
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:46.880]  people who really want to be involved in it, too, because it's partly a way to, I mean, the time
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:51.120]  capsule aspect is like, I'm not trying to make it a conceit. It's really each of these things will
[02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:56.000]  really be a preservation of history. So if you find, you know, you can use it as a teaching tool,
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.560]  as your own thing, but even in like 100, 200, 500 years, the things inside are not going to degrade,
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:08.960]  the metal will not melt. The wood is all hard aged, seasoned stuff that's used for wood type.
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:13.920]  So and the books we printed on your acid free paper, everything's gonna be whatever. So this
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:18.960]  thing is, I mean, I wish I'd be here in 500 years to see it. But but I really am thinking about it
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:24.880]  in that way that it's like both has present utility. But it will be a way to send, you know,
[02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:26.320]  send a gift to the future to
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.880]  Eric Spiekerman. I don't even know where you start. He, he has a new book. I forget who he
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:41.920]  did it with. I have it. With the guy who co founded Wired magazine, right?
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:46.960]  Oh, yeah, he did this thing. What he what I'm going to get from him as well as this is a story
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:54.400]  I wrote for in late 2017 is when I met him as I did a Skype interview about it. He has developed
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:59.520]  a hybrid digital letterpress approach. He calls it digital letterpress. Yeah, he figured out he's
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:06.800]  invested, like 60,000 euros into adapting a machine that makes plates for mostly for package
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:11.280]  printing called flexography. And these plates, these rubbery plates are exactly the kind of
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:18.000]  thing I use for my book project as well. But he wanted to be able to ingrate basically to laser
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:24.160]  cut an entire, like eight up printed sheet at once. So you can print eight pages of a book at
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:28.640]  one time on a larger press. And he's put all this money into it and he developed it. So is a Louis
[02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:34.080]  Rossetto. That's called change is good. Yeah. And they did a Kickstarter and I've got a copy of it.
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:39.280]  It's amazing. I do too. And I haven't read it. But I have I have it. It's in my book through it.
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.880]  It's in my giant pile of books to read. So it's letterpress printed, but it's it's it he's made
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:51.520]  it the most he's taken it the most easy way to go from from digital into letterpress that has
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:56.800]  ever existed because you can image these big sheets at once. And they printed it on an old
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:57:02.960]  letterpress that's beautifully maintained that can print at high speed. Right. And it's you know,
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:11.280]  it is the best of both worlds because oh my god, digital design is better than laying out metal
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:18.080]  type by hand. Not better, but it is certainly faster and more flexible. And nobody wants to
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:23.520]  give up the incredible efficiency of digital design. But on the other hand, the actual
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.640]  printed output of letterpress is just cannot be beaten. It is you know, it is visceral.
[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:35.120]  It's beautiful. It's everything you want it to be. So it truly is a combination of, you know,
[02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:41.920]  you get you get this superior output without sacrificing the incredible efficiency of the
[02:57:41.920 --> 02:57:46.240]  creative process doing it digitally. No, it's really it's amazing. It could only be done in
[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:52.880]  like we started 2017 or 2016 on it. And he's done books for Sir Comp and other publishers too. And
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:58.240]  but so the museum I make every museum is going to have samples of printing in it. So it'll have the
[02:57:58.240 --> 02:58:03.280]  artifacts that are used for printing and I've got I've got all it's amazing. I may put a small font
[02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:08.960]  of type in so it'll actually have individual small type characters. There's a there's a foundry
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:15.680]  founded in 1915 in San Francisco. It's still in operation. There's this couple called the Bixlers
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:21.520]  in upstate New York and skinny at least that are been running a foundry for decades. Ed Tufti's
[02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:29.040]  books, his original series, I think of four books were set in hot metal by the Bixlers. Because
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:36.080]  even though digital type existed Tufti did not like it. Right. Well, he wanted to use Bembo and
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:44.400]  Bembo was one of the typefaces that its translation to digital was I'm just stealing this all from
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:52.560]  Dean Allen's great, late write up of these great faces. But Bembo really was its digital
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:58.080]  translation was criminally bad. Because their versions now it was terrible at the time.
[02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:04.640]  Basically, it was done in a robotic fashion where here's the metal, let's take precise measurements
[02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:11.600]  will make a digital version that is exactly like this. And it when you use it, it came out way too
[02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:17.360]  spindly. I don't know what other adjectives it was too thin and spindly and fragile. Whereas Bembo
[02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:23.840]  is this sturdy, sturdy text type. And it's because what they should have been looking at is what does
[02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:29.680]  but what did the metal Bembo look like on paper? Not what did it look like? Well, not what did it
[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:35.440]  look like? It's actually a great case study for the way to do a digital translation. You know,
[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:40.320]  right where, where in a certain sense, what they did was more accurate, because they were
[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:47.040]  accurately modeling the shape of the letters on the metal. But in practice, it was it was a tragedy
[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:52.160]  because what actually came out of your laser printer when you use the digital version of Bembo
[02:59:52.160 --> 03:00:01.920]  was was not good. But in the meantime, Tufti has commissioned an ET Bembo, a digital version of
[03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:07.520]  Bembo that actually is good. That Yeah, right. Yeah. So he went from metal to his own version.
[03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:12.000]  But there was there was this era of the prototype era. And a lot of type was redrawn for prototype,
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:16.320]  which had its own parameters. So when they went to digital, they would take the large drawings
[03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:22.000]  for phototype and just scan those. This is the whole thing. The monotype, the Bertolt Volpe face,
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:26.800]  Albertus is the best known of his faces. Okay, yeah, right. Use the prisoner and a bunch of
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:32.480]  other places. The version of Albertus that monotype sold for 30 years is kind of terrible,
[03:00:32.480 --> 03:00:36.960]  because it was taken from prototype. And there's a younger designers guy, Toshio Megari,
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.800]  to become a friend. So as a result of these books, Toshio has become a friend of mine.
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:47.280]  Volpe's youngest son, Tobi, is a technology editor in Europe. And he and I are friends now.
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:51.760]  It's an amazing thing to have done that London project. And so Toshio
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:57.840]  reinterpreted and redrew these five different faces, including Albertus, so that they were
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:03.920]  actually designed for modern, you know, typesetting and printing. And they're just I mean, he went
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:13.040]  back to the original brass patterns used by monotype to cut the metal and then to Volpe's
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:19.840]  original hand drawings done for monotype for this. And so they're not just slavish to the original,
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:25.920]  but they're informed by Volpe's own hand and the interpretation. And anyway, so part of what I mean,
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.720]  this is part of the thing is I'm going to include little bits and pieces of that whole era. So like
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:36.160]  the pre-Hot Metal era, I'll include some letterpress examples, digital letterpress with
[03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:42.400]  some examples from Spiekermann to include. Rich Kegler, who runs P22 Type Foundry,
[03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:46.240]  he's got a bunch of stuff that we're going to get from him, from someone from the digital era.
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:51.840]  And he's offered, I'm going to include at least two films that are also in digital form,
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:56.720]  Making Faces about a metal type designer and Graphic Means, that's about the
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:01.280]  the prototype era. So yeah, anyway, I want to make something that's like really,
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:08.080]  you want to take everything out and hold it in your hand and look at it. And we'll see,
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:11.840]  we'll see. It's getting close, it's getting close, about two thirds funded as we talk with
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:15.360]  a week left. And that's how kickstarters go. Well, let's make it, let's make it work. And
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:23.200]  people can find out more at tinytypemuseum.com, right? Yes. Yeah, it will redirect to the
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:28.560]  Kickstarter campaign. And then after the campaign, it will have its own thing. But
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:32.880]  tinytypemuseum.com, let's make this, let's get this funded. I say you're going to hit,
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:38.240]  I think you're going to make it. As usual with yours, though, it's going to be right down to
[03:02:38.240 --> 03:02:46.000]  the wire. That's my trademark. I did a podcast crowdfunding, and it funded with 15 seconds to go
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:51.760]  last year. It was great. But the thing is, here's the deal. I've had so many amazing
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:56.560]  conversations with people, design educators and designers and letterpress people and people like
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:01.360]  my father, my mother was a typesetter for 50 years, it has been such a like,
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:06.240]  glorious emotional experience. I'll be happy when I can actually make the thing. But wow,
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:11.040]  and this is what's great. And you know this from your interest and love of design and type is that
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:14.960]  it's not just about the way something looks. There's this incredible emotional experience
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:19.200]  around it. And being part of that is always exciting to me. And whatever I can get back to it,
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:25.360]  I just am so happy to to step a little bit away from the digital side and back into that kind of
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:30.160]  or I should say from the non aesthetic side and into the digital design and analog design side.
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:36.080]  Well, I I'm glad you're doing it. And I can't wait to see that.
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:37.680]  Thank you very much.
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:44.560]  Let's wrap it up. Let me thank our sponsors for the week. Eero at eero.com slash the talk show
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:52.000]  Wi Fi that works molecule, the only air purifier that actually destroys pollutants there at
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:04:00.480]  molecule with a k.com. And code for them is talk show and Casper. Great mattresses,
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:07.120]  great sleep stuff 50 bucks off with code talk show. And tiny tight museum Glenn's Kickstarter,
[03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:15.120]  which is probably as you listen to this six days or less. Before it goes up. Let's make it happen.
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:18.800]  Glenn, thank you for the time. It's always a pleasure having you on the show. Our interests
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:21.600]  overlap and to a degree is almost frightening.
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:25.040]  I was gonna say is always like to talk to you about
[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:39.280]  baby edit old Mac apps and letterpress typesetting Bembo
