[00:00.000 --> 00:05.440]  It's good to have you here, Quinn Nelson. I feel like let's just start the show with me apologizing
[00:05.440 --> 00:11.600]  to you. I believe several years ago, you and I, when we first started interacting on the internet,
[00:11.600 --> 00:14.400]  we got off on the wrong foot. Do you remember the details of that?
[00:14.400 --> 00:20.000]  Oh, yeah. I remember. It was the day John Gruber sent his minions after me. Just kidding. No,
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.800]  I had published a video, I think, about why I didn't think that the iPhone XS was a
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.320]  worthwhile upgrade or something. I think you had quote tweeted my video saying,
[00:30.320 --> 00:36.640]  100 bucks says this guy buys the iPhone. Well, I made it my mission for 12 months
[00:37.200 --> 00:40.240]  to abstain from purchasing one so that I could prove you wrong.
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.800]  So did I pay you? Did I owe you 100 bucks?
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.800]  You did. I didn't bring it up. I think after a year, you said, hey,
[00:50.800 --> 00:58.560]  I think that I owe you 100 bucks. And I said, nah, just donate it to charity. I think we chose one
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.280]  and both donated it. Anyway, it worked out great. Yeah.
[01:01.280 --> 01:09.280]  Yeah. But I do. I owe you a sincere apology. No, I do. But you know what? This guy was rude. And
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.520]  the backstory, as I recall it, and again, at this point, my recollection might be a little fuzzy,
[01:15.520 --> 01:22.880]  but I saw the video. I sincerely thought I disagreed with you that it wasn't worth a
[01:22.880 --> 01:27.200]  purchase and thought you'd cave and buy. But I wasn't familiar with your work,
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.040]  so I didn't know your name. And I looked at your YouTube channel, and that's Snazzy Labs.
[01:33.040 --> 01:39.600]  And it would have taken me, what, 30 seconds to somehow find Quinn Nelson as the star of
[01:39.600 --> 01:49.200]  Snazzy Labs. But I didn't. This guy reads a lot better. Well, it worked out in the end,
[01:49.200 --> 01:54.560]  and I hope we can be pals. But you were right, and I was wrong. You didn't buy it.
[01:54.560 --> 02:00.320]  That's true. I didn't. And I moved on. Well, let's start with that though. Because
[02:02.320 --> 02:08.160]  I've become, in the years since, I am an enormous fan of your work on YouTube.
[02:08.160 --> 02:18.880]  Oh, well, thank you. I believe it's funny. I feel like everything is getting better
[02:20.400 --> 02:29.600]  as Twitter slowly breaks up. To me, Twitter is sort of collapsing like the ice sheafs down in
[02:29.600 --> 02:37.520]  Antarctica. It's not going all at once. It's going slowly. And I think that this new world
[02:37.520 --> 02:47.120]  of Mastodon and more diverse forums for people to spend their Twitter-like time on places other
[02:47.120 --> 02:53.120]  than Twitter, I feel like it's all for the good. But on the other hand, now that it's all sort of
[02:53.120 --> 02:58.400]  splintered, I forget where I saw stuff. Oh, me too. Totally.
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.000]  So that's my long way of saying, I think it's on your Mastodon handle. I guess I could look
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.760]  it up right now. But I try to be honest here on the podcast and go with what's in my head. But
[03:09.760 --> 03:13.840]  somewhere, I think it's on your Mastodon profile. You link to your YouTube channel,
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.000]  and the description just says, my life's work. Oh, yeah. That's on Mastodon.
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.840]  That stuck out to me. And again, I don't want to embarrass you here, but it shows in your videos
[03:27.840 --> 03:34.720]  that that's how serious you take your videos as works of art. It's your life.
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.240]  Thank you. Because that was a bit tongue in cheek. Because often I think producing YouTube videos or
[03:40.240 --> 03:46.240]  being a quote unquote YouTuber is dismissed by a lot of traditional journalism and a lot of times
[03:46.240 --> 03:53.280]  for good reason. I mean, there's a lot of YouTubers out there that are no good. But for everyone that
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.240]  does a terrible job, I think there's at least a few that do a pretty good one. And I hope to
[03:58.240 --> 04:07.280]  think that I'm in the latter half of those individuals. Well, it's a weird racket to be in.
[04:07.280 --> 04:20.640]  And it is hyper competitive. And it is, I think, a sort of generational divide. And I hope I don't
[04:20.640 --> 04:30.240]  know. I hope I'm humble enough. But I can kind of see it where I just turned 50. I think that
[04:30.240 --> 04:36.080]  for people who are, if we roughly define a generation as 20 years, people who are around
[04:36.080 --> 04:52.560]  30, YouTube is the primary indie media outlet. It's not blogging anymore. And what's happened
[04:52.560 --> 04:57.760]  with YouTube is what I expected to happen with blogging 20 years ago. When I started
[04:57.760 --> 05:08.160]  Daring Fireball, I expected by this time, 20 years hence, that almost, I just thought that the future
[05:08.160 --> 05:15.120]  of people who were talented at writing and had the draw to write, the compulsion, which in my opinion,
[05:15.120 --> 05:21.680]  you kind of need to have to do anything in the media. Otherwise, you burn out. I just thought
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.200]  that almost everybody doing it would be doing it on their own blogs under their own name
[05:27.200 --> 05:33.120]  by now. And it clearly did not turn out to be the case. I think there are fewer people blogging
[05:34.080 --> 05:42.880]  like I do independently. Whereas with video, to me, there's clearly far more people who are making
[05:42.880 --> 05:53.360]  a full-time career on YouTube as independent media outlets like Snazzy Labs, MKBHD, iJustine.
[05:53.360 --> 05:57.920]  If I sit here and list them, I mean, we'd use up the whole two hours of the show.
[05:57.920 --> 05:59.360]  That's right.
[05:59.360 --> 06:06.480]  But YouTube is the outlet for video that I thought blogging would be. And I'm not quite sure why that
[06:06.480 --> 06:11.120]  didn't work out for writing because there's still just as much writing going on. But it seems to me
[06:11.120 --> 06:17.760]  like people do it for outlets. They get a job working for such and such website and they do
[06:17.760 --> 06:24.640]  it. Whereas YouTube, there's far more people doing YouTube as a thriving career than there
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.280]  are people on traditional television. Sure. Sure.
[06:29.280 --> 06:31.440]  When did you know that that's what you wanted to do?
[06:32.960 --> 06:37.360]  I kind of fell into it. I think I started producing YouTube. I don't know that you could
[06:37.360 --> 06:42.320]  call it producing. I started recording YouTube videos when I was 15. So I've been doing this,
[06:42.320 --> 06:47.680]  I guess at the end of the year, I will have been making videos longer in my life than
[06:47.680 --> 06:54.480]  I haven't been making videos, which is wild. So I'm almost 30. I turned 30 this week.
[06:54.480 --> 06:57.200]  Oh, happy birthday.
[06:57.200 --> 07:05.280]  Oh, thank you. And I think that I am maybe biased a little bit into the older generation slightly
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.960]  of blogging and that kind of tech publication style because that's what I grew up with.
[07:10.960 --> 07:16.800]  I grew up reading during Fireball and listening to podcasts from a bunch of different networks
[07:16.800 --> 07:23.120]  years and years and years and years ago. And that in many ways fostered my love and interest in
[07:23.120 --> 07:30.240]  technology and eventually kind of compelled me to do stuff on my own. And when I was 15, I had
[07:30.800 --> 07:35.600]  no idea that it was certainly, certainly no idea it was going to become my career,
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.760]  but I didn't even think it was going to become a job. In fact,
[07:37.760 --> 07:42.880]  I don't think that I knew you could monetize videos on YouTube when I started making them.
[07:42.880 --> 07:46.880]  And it was just totally something that I wanted to do because I thought it was
[07:46.880 --> 07:52.320]  cool and fun and interesting. And I liked listening to podcasts and reading tech articles,
[07:52.320 --> 07:58.560]  but didn't have an outlet to do that. I wasn't sophisticated enough to set up my own CMS and
[07:58.560 --> 08:04.240]  publish my own site. There was no place where any sane place where a 15 year old was able to
[08:04.240 --> 08:08.560]  have the keyboard and write articles, right? So YouTube kind of became that outlet and that's
[08:09.200 --> 08:14.880]  very luckily, I guess, grown with me over time. It provided a good healthy job when I was in college.
[08:14.880 --> 08:21.200]  And then when I graduated, I decided to go full time and that was five years ago. And it doesn't
[08:21.200 --> 08:26.720]  look like it's going away anytime soon, but it is a lot different than kind of the self-publishing
[08:26.720 --> 08:34.320]  method that I wish in many ways was tenable for video because I think that being in control of
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.600]  your audience is really valuable. But I also think that platforms like YouTube have permitted
[08:39.600 --> 08:47.120]  a much greater number of people to find success because doing what you do, and I'm not trying to
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.320]  pat you on the back and say good job, but I think doing what you do is a lot harder because not only
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.880]  do you have to provide engaging and interesting content, but you've got to find that audience to
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.200]  begin with. And I don't really have to do that. YouTube just provides it to me as long as I make
[09:01.200 --> 09:08.400]  interesting stuff. I find that spooky though. It's terrifying. Right. I feel like you and I are,
[09:10.240 --> 09:18.160]  I do. I'm not an overly anxious person generally, but every once in a while I just sort of wake up
[09:18.160 --> 09:29.440]  and I just have that fear. Right. And it is, it's weird when you don't see your audience. Right.
[09:29.440 --> 09:35.760]  And live, I do my live once a year talk show with the audience and I get nervous as hell for that,
[09:35.760 --> 09:47.120]  but it's very, if I start thinking about it, even right now during the show, now all of a
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.000]  sudden I'm freaking myself out. I'm like, who are these people that are opening up their web browser
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.760]  and typing DA and it auto completes to Daring Fireball and they hit return and start reading
[09:57.760 --> 10:04.400]  my site and they keep coming back. I know they're out there, but you don't see them,
[10:05.120 --> 10:11.760]  but it is different. And I'm not sure that I would deal well with the stress of doing it on
[10:11.760 --> 10:20.880]  YouTube because like you say, people don't come to, they don't start typing S N a to go to snazzy
[10:20.880 --> 10:28.880]  labs. They type in YO to go to YouTube. And I get, when you come out with a new video,
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.080]  I get suggested because their algorithm is pretty good and they seem to know what I like.
[10:34.080 --> 10:43.040]  I, it doesn't seem like I miss your videos, but you, you're at the mercy of the algorithm, right?
[10:43.040 --> 10:47.840]  Yeah, you absolutely are. I guess you live and die by the sword, right? As long as you're doing
[10:47.840 --> 10:54.080]  what YouTube wants and expects, then you receive the reward and viewership, but it is spooky. I
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.640]  can, I can look in my dashboard. I don't know the number off the top of my head, but I think that
[10:58.640 --> 11:05.040]  the percentage of returning viewers I have is fewer than 40%. And I think the number that
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.600]  are actually subscribed that have gone and hit the button that says, yeah, I would like to see this.
[11:09.600 --> 11:16.400]  I think it hovers around 25%. So the vast majority of viewership that I receive are people that have
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.560]  a not subscribed to me, but B don't even know who I am. They watch one video and they go cool
[11:22.560 --> 11:29.680]  and they leave. And that's, that's really spooky because as soon as YouTube decides, ah,
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.800]  he's not that interesting or, or his metrics are no longer as strong as they used to be,
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.120]  then they just stop recommending the channel. And it's happened to people time and time and
[11:39.120 --> 11:47.200]  time again. And I, I like to think that I've been strategic enough to notice trends on YouTube and
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.080]  adapt my content to them, but I am at their mercy. And that's something that has terrified
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.280]  me from day one. And it's something that I, in the last couple of years have been more
[11:57.280 --> 12:04.640]  actively working towards avoiding. So that should YouTube go belly up or should I become unfavorable
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.480]  in the eyes of YouTube? I might have to let go part of my staff, but at least we still have
[12:11.200 --> 12:18.720]  some form of living. Yeah. I think that the fear YouTube itself clearly isn't going to go away.
[12:18.720 --> 12:25.600]  I think, but I think that the possibility is that what YouTube is morphs into something
[12:26.240 --> 12:34.720]  incompatible with the range of things that you can do and that you want to do. Right. Because
[12:35.280 --> 12:41.600]  one thing that sticks out to me about the YouTube professionals like you and MKBHD, I just,
[12:41.600 --> 12:50.240]  I just seen that I like is that you're clearly not catering just to the algorithm. Right.
[12:50.240 --> 12:56.240]  And you can see when you look over in the sidebar and it's like, I don't know who that is, but it's
[12:56.240 --> 13:04.080]  like just pure YouTube bait for lack of a better word. Right. You know, like I always say, it's
[13:04.080 --> 13:11.200]  like one of my repeated mantras that it's not just like, what are your top three priorities? The
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.560]  order of those priorities makes a profound difference. And obviously one of your priorities
[13:16.560 --> 13:22.080]  is to be popular on YouTube because it's your career, but it's very clear to me that you have
[13:22.080 --> 13:26.240]  a higher priority, which is that you only want to produce videos you're proud of.
[13:27.600 --> 13:33.360]  Well, I appreciate it. I certainly hope that that's what people perceive. I, there's a lot of,
[13:34.720 --> 13:40.160]  I don't want to bad mouth anyone. There's a lot of desire from, from other YouTubers to,
[13:40.160 --> 13:47.120]  to game or hack the system to, to produce content that is designed purely to be clicked on.
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.800]  And I don't want to say that that's not hard because I actually think that it is,
[13:51.520 --> 13:59.680]  but it's just soul sucking. So I, I frequently try to convince myself when a video doesn't
[13:59.680 --> 14:06.400]  perform to expectations or when we have a couple of months that are slow where I'm feeling down
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.880]  creatively that, Hey, you know what? You can look back and still be proud of this,
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.160]  this information and this content it's useful. There were people that learn things and I try
[14:16.160 --> 14:22.240]  to convince myself that if I was purely motivated by money and viewership, that I would be a lot
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.680]  more successful on YouTube than I am. Yeah, but it's just not something that I have any
[14:27.680 --> 14:33.440]  interest in making. So yeah, one thing you guys get, and I know from talking with Rene Ritchie
[14:33.440 --> 14:42.560]  is now he's at YouTube, but I'm familiar enough with how it works, but you guys get explicit
[14:43.920 --> 14:50.320]  details on which videos perform. I mean, absolutely. And that's one of those areas
[14:50.320 --> 14:56.720]  where what you do is so different from what I do, right? Like I don't find out, I never find out,
[14:56.720 --> 15:04.000]  I guess if I wanted to hook up analytics, I could kind of find out if a certain article gets shared
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.840]  more, but I don't, I don't look at that. Right. It's like, I, I kind of just look
[15:09.840 --> 15:16.480]  every once, once or twice a month, I'll look at the overall number of hits coming to the website,
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.400]  but it's like, I've turned off Google analytics a couple of years ago and I don't really get
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.680]  fine grain details. And even when I did, I didn't really look at them and it never really showed
[15:25.680 --> 15:34.080]  anything. Like I'm lucky that Daring Fireballs homepage is a destination. Like, and one thing
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.400]  that that's the one thing I look at is are people, do people still go to my homepage?
[15:38.400 --> 15:45.200]  Like, cause that's sort of in my mind, how people read the site, right? You guys though,
[15:45.760 --> 15:51.680]  you get like, Oh, I thought this video was, this is like one of my favorite videos I made this year.
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.840]  And it's like half the traffic of my average. Yeah. And not only that, but you can see
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.680]  how long people watched on average, where specifically in the video people decided to
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.720]  stop watching the demographics, where people are located, their age, their interests,
[16:08.720 --> 16:13.440]  other videos that they've been interested in. I mean, the amount of granularity is,
[16:13.440 --> 16:19.760]  is pretty insane. It's actually overwhelming. And there are, I think there's three stages.
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.000]  There's people that are on YouTube purely to attain viewership and create wealth
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.400]  that totally design their videos to perform that you have the middle section, which is people that
[16:32.400 --> 16:38.480]  are probably smarter than I am. That go, okay, we liked bits and pieces of this video at four
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.480]  minutes and 20 seconds, there was a drop. Let's analyze why this was, Oh, we decided to do a
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.240]  little bit of a montage and there was 15 minutes of silence. People don't like that. So let's,
[16:48.240 --> 16:55.280]  let's cut that out for the, I don't really look at analytics at all. I will. And what I don't
[16:55.280 --> 17:01.280]  want to imply is that I don't. Strategically create an and release content because I
[17:01.280 --> 17:07.120]  absolutely do. Because unfortunately I can't as much as I would like to release a video
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.400]  willy nilly about one of my weird unique interests, because it's just not going to
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.120]  perform on YouTube. So there's a lot of stuff that I just, I can't make videos about because
[17:17.120 --> 17:22.800]  not only will people not watch that video, but a video that doesn't perform well can impact
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.560]  future performance on the channel. But I don't get so into the nitty gritty
[17:28.560 --> 17:33.760]  that I let my videos be dictated by past analytical performance. Because I think once
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.600]  you start to do that, you lose the artistry and you lose the fun and you lose the love of,
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.640]  of just making interesting stuff. And it becomes more of a game of, of how do I beat the system?
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.760]  And, and there's a lot of people that like that, but I, I don't, I think it's terrible.
[17:49.760 --> 17:53.040]  And I don't think it's sustainable. I don't either.
[17:53.040 --> 17:57.440]  I think the people who play it that way tend to come and go and it's,
[17:57.440 --> 18:02.000]  it's always fresh faces and it just isn't sustainable.
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.320]  And some people will hit it big. I mean, they'll, they'll come in and they'll,
[18:06.320 --> 18:10.720]  they'll go like crazy for four or five years. They make millions of dollars in cash out.
[18:10.720 --> 18:17.040]  My strategy is make just enough to keep going and do it for your whole, for your whole life.
[18:17.040 --> 18:21.760]  I don't know who's smarter, but I think I'm certainly more passionate.
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.560]  But that's now we've come full circle though. And now you're speaking my language, right?
[18:26.560 --> 18:32.480]  Where it's like, I just got done doing taxes for the year and I've had the same account since I
[18:32.480 --> 18:37.680]  started and was making no money from the website. And I had to tell him, Hey, I'm starting this
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.000]  thing on the side. I guess hoping it will become a business and here we are. And I've
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.960]  sustained my family with it, but basically once it got to, Hey, this is a nice income for the
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.760]  family. I was like, okay, I'm done with that part of it. Now just concentrate on the work
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.920]  and good enough. All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[18:58.640 --> 19:04.000]  They are back and they are literally one of my favorite companies in the world. I am so happy
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.400]  to have them back as a sponsor. Backblaze. Backblaze offers unlimited computer backup
[19:10.400 --> 19:17.680]  for Macs, PCs, and businesses starts at just seven bucks a month. You back up your documents,
[19:17.680 --> 19:23.680]  your music, your photos, your videos, drawings, contracts, projects, all of your data, stuff that
[19:23.680 --> 19:30.640]  goes in, in Mac OS terms in your home. Directory, all of that, all of it, no matter how big it is,
[19:30.640 --> 19:36.320]  even if you've got terabytes of data, it all gets backed up to Backblaze for seven bucks a month.
[19:36.320 --> 19:42.000]  And you can access your backed up data from anywhere in the world using they've got apps
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  for your phone. So if you just want to get to a certain file, you could just go right into
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.400]  Backblaze app. They have a web app, so you can just get on a web browser anywhere from any machine
[19:52.400 --> 20:01.360]  and access your backup. If catastrophe strikes and your desktop machine goes belly up, bursts
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.160]  in the ceiling over your computer, dumps water all over it, ruins the whole thing,
[20:06.800 --> 20:10.080]  you need the whole thing. You don't just need a file. You need all of it.
[20:10.080 --> 20:14.640]  You can get restored by mail. They'll just put everything on a hard drive and ship it to you
[20:14.640 --> 20:20.560]  overnight. And when you get a hard drive restore like this, you send the drive back to them within
[20:20.560 --> 20:25.120]  30 days, you get a full refund for the drive. So you're not even paying for the drive that
[20:25.120 --> 20:29.040]  you don't need. They'll mail you the hard drive. You can restore all of your data,
[20:29.680 --> 20:34.000]  send the drive back to them. You get all your money back. And for an extra two bucks a month,
[20:34.960 --> 20:40.880]  you can increase your retention history to one year. So what does that mean? You pay two more
[20:40.880 --> 20:46.480]  dollars a month, two measly bucks. But that means if you delete something and six months later,
[20:46.480 --> 20:51.040]  you're like, ah, crap, I need that file back. They've got it. You could just go to backblaze,
[20:51.040 --> 20:57.200]  get it back. They have restored over 55 billion files for their customers.
[20:57.200 --> 21:03.760]  Go to where do you go to find out more? You get a free, full featured, no credit card required
[21:03.760 --> 21:13.120]  trial at backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball. That's backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball.
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.880]  Go there, check it out. I have been a paying customer for them for easily more than 10 years.
[21:18.880 --> 21:25.760]  Couldn't be happier. My thanks to Backblaze. So I really wanted you on the show recently.
[21:25.760 --> 21:31.920]  I've been meaning to ask you for a while, but your recent videos, it's like bing, bing. Oh,
[21:31.920 --> 21:36.240]  I would love to talk about that on my podcast. And then another video drops and I'm like,
[21:36.240 --> 21:39.440]  I want to talk about this. Well, thank you. That's a good thing, I guess.
[21:39.440 --> 21:46.320]  Oh, no, definitely really is. One of your recent videos was sort of a deep dive.
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.240]  Let's just start with this because WWDC is coming up in what, six weeks, something like that.
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.400]  The rumored at this point, I would say it's more than rumored Apple headset.
[21:59.680 --> 22:05.920]  Can you summarize? This is a tough ask, but can you summarize your video about the headset
[22:05.920 --> 22:11.200]  before we continue talking about it? Yeah, we mostly just talked about
[22:11.200 --> 22:15.680]  the rumored specifications. There's been so many rumors from so many people over
[22:15.680 --> 22:20.480]  years. This thing has been rumored, right? And so we tried to take everything that was out there and
[22:20.480 --> 22:28.480]  distill it into something that was intelligible, trackable. And then also I tried to explain what
[22:28.480 --> 22:34.000]  some of those rumors may suggest or may mean because there are several features of this
[22:34.000 --> 22:40.400]  headset that if Apple can pull them off would not just be a first for the industry, but
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.360]  game changer like features. Like, for example.
[22:48.480 --> 22:53.280]  So one of the biggest kind of headlining features that they're expected to provide,
[22:53.840 --> 22:59.520]  one of the major holdups with ushering AR and VR into,
[22:59.520 --> 23:05.200]  I should say, beyond gaming and very specific industrial applications is pixel density.
[23:05.760 --> 23:12.400]  In VR, they use the term pixels per degree rather than pixels per inch, because the PPI is
[23:12.400 --> 23:20.800]  obviously the measure of the pixels on a flat plane. Once you put lenses in that distort the
[23:20.800 --> 23:28.000]  shape of those displays, you have to change the metric by which that's kind of what you're
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.480]  metric by which that's kind of measured. The PPD that is kind of been established,
[23:34.480 --> 23:38.640]  just like the term retina that Steve Jobs used on stage, which I don't know how true that is.
[23:38.640 --> 23:46.000]  But the idea of once you hit this position, you can no longer distinguish greater pixel density
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.920]  is about, I should look my numbers up before I say them. I believe it was about 160 pixels
[23:51.920 --> 23:57.360]  per degree. Current VR headsets right now are about a quarter of that. So we're still very
[23:57.360 --> 24:03.680]  much in the phase of displays are getting more dense, they're getting more impressive.
[24:04.480 --> 24:07.360]  But you still clearly can tell that it's not real life.
[24:09.200 --> 24:16.240]  And if you focus on pixels, you can see them. The rumored Apple headset is alleged to have
[24:16.240 --> 24:23.760]  4000 pixels in each direction per eye. So they're two square displays, 4000 by 4000 per eye,
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.640]  which would give you an effective if you're to kind of translate in that into a 16 by
[24:28.640 --> 24:34.320]  nine understandable resolution to be an 8k display. Current headsets right now are a
[24:34.320 --> 24:40.720]  fraction of that. There are a few really niche, really expensive headsets that can push closer
[24:40.720 --> 24:46.720]  to what Apple's numbers are suggesting. But mass kind of consumer VR and AR headsets are barely
[24:46.720 --> 24:55.040]  pushing over 2000 by 2000 per eye. So quite literally, double the pixel density per eye.
[24:55.040 --> 25:02.480]  So 4x the number of pixels in a headset that's not running off of some insane
[25:03.120 --> 25:07.520]  desktop gaming computer. It's something that's allegedly supposed to be self-contained.
[25:08.080 --> 25:15.440]  And in order to make that even viable, they have to do a bunch of stuff that other manufacturers
[25:15.440 --> 25:20.000]  have started doing that works really, really well. I mean, the PlayStation VR does what they
[25:20.000 --> 25:28.080]  call eye tracking. I've used it. I'm not a gamer, but my son has a PS5 and he's got the headset,
[25:28.080 --> 25:34.400]  so I've used it and I know what you're talking about. Yeah, it's wild because they call it
[25:34.400 --> 25:41.680]  foveated rendering, right? So you can still make it look realistic by rendering stuff that's
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.480]  further away from where your eyeballs are focused less accurately. You save on your GPU and your
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.160]  compute and to the wearer, you don't even notice because you're not looking at it. Foveated
[25:52.160 --> 25:56.960]  rendering has been a thing in VR for a few years, but it's only worked typically in the center
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.200]  because that's where your eyes tend to look. But if you shift your eyeballs in your eye sockets
[26:01.200 --> 26:06.960]  without moving your head, that effect starts to diminish in quality. With the PlayStation VR,
[26:06.960 --> 26:12.960]  they use infrared iris trackers to look where your pupils are focused and then to redirect
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.400]  the foveated rendering circle to that area. The effect is remarkably convincing. When you have
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.680]  that set on, you can't even tell, but when you're... I don't know if you looked at the
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.840]  display when Jonah or someone else was using the headset, but it's wild because you can tell
[26:29.840 --> 26:35.440]  exactly where they're looking in the headset on the TV because it's the only part that looks sharp
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.280]  and everything else looks awful. But in the headset, you have no idea because you're not
[26:39.280 --> 26:47.680]  focused on it. It's pretty cool. Yeah. It's a fundamentally different way of approaching
[26:47.680 --> 26:55.200]  displays, right? So I'm talking to you right now in front of my studio display, which I love,
[26:55.200 --> 27:01.200]  absolutely adore this, I guess now exactly. Well, no, it didn't get to me till June, but
[27:01.200 --> 27:06.160]  a year old studio display. But a traditional display, and it's a perfect example of it,
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.200]  it's from corner to corner the same resolution. And it has to be, right? And I know this sounds
[27:13.200 --> 27:21.840]  like, duh, of course. And your TV is the same way. The far upper left corner of 32 by 32 pixels
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.920]  up there in the corner is exactly the same brightness, pixel density, et cetera, as the
[27:27.920 --> 27:33.120]  pixels right in the dead center of the display because the display has no idea where you're
[27:33.120 --> 27:46.480]  looking, right? Yep. Yep. And with VR, you could, at some point, if you had infinite
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.920]  graphical computing, you could render the whole thing at full resolution and full brightness.
[27:51.920 --> 27:59.920]  And if you have the battery and have the graphics to do it, sure, why not? It wouldn't hurt to
[27:59.920 --> 28:06.960]  render your peripheral vision at a higher resolution. But in the real world where this
[28:06.960 --> 28:12.560]  is pushing the limits of graphic cards that you could conceivably fit in something you're
[28:12.560 --> 28:19.840]  supposed to put on your head, and again, rumors, here we are spending a whole show talking about
[28:19.840 --> 28:25.360]  this thing that we could wait six weeks and find the details, but where's the fun in that?
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.520]  Right. But the rumors are that it gets only about two hours of battery life with sort of
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.920]  something that Gurman has described as roughly the size of a phone itself or Apple's-
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.640]  I think he said two iPhone 14 Pro Maxes stacked together. So pretty beefy.
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.200]  Yeah, pretty beefy. Some kind of battery pack that you would put in your pocket or put on your
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.280]  belt. I don't know what we're supposed to do with it. It seems a little awkward to me, but we'll see.
[28:51.280 --> 28:56.000]  But the battery's got to go somewhere. But even with an external battery, let's just say the
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.920]  rumor's true. You have to wear an iPhone-sized battery or two iPhone-sized batteries in your
[29:01.920 --> 29:07.040]  pocket and have a cable going to the headset, and you still only get two hours of battery life if
[29:07.040 --> 29:14.800]  that rumors are true. It would be a complete waste of that battery life and the graphics to render
[29:14.800 --> 29:22.800]  the full field of these 4,000 by 4,000 displays at full resolution. And it turns out that's how
[29:22.800 --> 29:28.400]  our eyes work. I'm intimately familiar with it. I've had retinal detachments in both eyes. I don't
[29:28.400 --> 29:34.160]  want to go into- But I've learned a lot about how our human vision works over the last 10 years,
[29:34.160 --> 29:41.680]  and it's exactly how human vision works. Your peripheral vision as a human being is so much
[29:41.680 --> 29:50.720]  worse than your brain has convinced you that you think it is. And because our eyes have seemingly,
[29:50.720 --> 29:57.680]  again, it's an illusion. Our eyes don't have zero latency. They have latency, but our brains have
[29:57.680 --> 30:02.080]  completely convinced us that they don't. And so everywhere you think you see in your peripheral
[30:02.080 --> 30:10.480]  vision, as soon as you shift your gaze over there, it's all just focused on the center of your retina,
[30:10.480 --> 30:15.840]  which is called, I should know, the macula, right? And effectively, that's what VR is doing. Your
[30:15.840 --> 30:22.560]  macula in the center of your retina is really the only thing that sees anything clearly. Everything
[30:22.560 --> 30:31.440]  else is sort of sketched out, really. It really is. That's how VR... And I think that's what Apple
[30:31.440 --> 30:37.360]  is going to do with this headset. I think it's fascinating. Yeah. I think it's the only way they
[30:37.360 --> 30:42.240]  can get away with using a display that's that high resolution and make effective use of it.
[30:42.240 --> 30:46.720]  It's just to render a very small portion of it at one-to-one, and then everything else,
[30:47.520 --> 30:53.280]  make it blockier and crappier because you won't really pay attention. But you can move your eyes
[30:53.280 --> 30:58.880]  and look in a new direction, and it'll update and re-render stuff faster or as fast as your
[30:58.880 --> 31:04.960]  eyes can track anyway that you won't even really believe it's happening. So that rumor, I think,
[31:04.960 --> 31:09.840]  is really interesting and really exciting. Additionally, because Apple... Again,
[31:09.840 --> 31:15.120]  this is all conjecture and rumorings, but Apple's rumored to have partnered with Sony
[31:15.120 --> 31:23.600]  to use Sony's OLED micro displays. And there's a bit of marketing hubbub surrounding the term
[31:23.600 --> 31:33.280]  micro OLED, because there's micro OLED, which is the idea that you put the pixels on the silicon
[31:33.280 --> 31:39.280]  substrate directly, which allows you to achieve a much higher pixel density and a much smaller
[31:39.280 --> 31:44.640]  scale. So that's micro OLED, and that'll be making its way into TVs in the future. There's already
[31:44.640 --> 31:52.000]  prototypes of it. But Sony has what they call OLED micro displays. And Sony's OLED micro displays
[31:52.000 --> 32:00.960]  are micro OLED, but they call them micro displays because they're physically really, really small.
[32:00.960 --> 32:06.240]  I mean, their largest micro display they sell right now, I think, is just under one square
[32:06.240 --> 32:13.520]  inch. So they're very, very tiny displays, but they're really impressive because they have
[32:13.520 --> 32:19.040]  those pixels directly on the silicon. And because they're OLED, they can make them pretty bright.
[32:19.040 --> 32:24.160]  They can make their pixel density really high. Their refresh rate is incredibly impressive.
[32:24.160 --> 32:31.360]  And the only thing at Cossia is an arm and a leg. And so there are rumors that Apple is working
[32:31.360 --> 32:39.120]  with Sony to create an OLED micro display for this headset, but it would be a technical triumph
[32:39.120 --> 32:45.680]  because all that Sony has been able to produce so far is about a one inch by one inch 1080p display.
[32:45.680 --> 32:52.240]  So if Apple is intending to go 4K per eye, that's quite literally four times the number of pixels
[32:52.240 --> 32:56.960]  in a display that physically will be larger than one square inch, I'm presuming, but not that much.
[32:57.520 --> 33:05.600]  And so, yeah, it'll be unbelievable. That's why these rumors that they almost sound too good to
[33:05.600 --> 33:11.440]  be true. But I also think that one of the reasons that Apple has held off for years and years and
[33:11.440 --> 33:19.200]  years of allegedly having been developing this for almost a decade that they needed to wait until it
[33:19.200 --> 33:25.200]  was convincingly ready to rumble. And that may be that point in time, but I still think that it
[33:25.200 --> 33:30.800]  may be too early. I don't know. Well, that leads into my next question about the displays. And I
[33:30.800 --> 33:42.880]  wonder, so in hindsight, it's funny to me what we're looking at 2007 to 2023. So this will be
[33:42.880 --> 33:49.840]  the 16th year of iPhones, that there were only three of them before the retina display, right?
[33:49.840 --> 33:55.680]  There was just the iPhone, the iPhone 3G, and then the 3GS, and then it went retina with the iPhone
[33:55.680 --> 34:03.920]  4. And what I find so humorous about that is that when the iPhone came out, it was at 163 pixels per
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.320]  inch. It was the highest, maybe not the highest density display in the world, but it was the
[34:08.320 --> 34:13.680]  highest density display in a consumer product, right? Certainly on a handheld. Right. It was a
[34:13.680 --> 34:22.240]  much nicer display. The Macs at the time were somewhere around like 100 to 120 pixels per
[34:22.240 --> 34:26.400]  inch, depending on which model or whether it's a laptop or a standalone display. But
[34:27.280 --> 34:34.560]  you got enough more pixels per inch where it just seemed amazing. Here's this thing in my pocket,
[34:34.560 --> 34:42.080]  and it has a better display than my big ass computer. And then only the fourth generation in,
[34:42.080 --> 34:47.280]  they were like double the pixels per square inch, which is actually a quadrupling of the total
[34:47.280 --> 34:54.640]  pixels that the thing has to drive. Sure. And it raised, and it was amazing. It was like,
[34:54.640 --> 35:02.720]  holy crap, I thought my iPhone 3GS, and I just remember being at the hands-on area. It was the
[35:02.720 --> 35:10.240]  last, the iPhone 4 was the last one that debuted at a WWDC. Also the last one where Steve Jobs was
[35:10.240 --> 35:17.120]  there. But it was June 2010. And I just remember very vividly that the hands-on area for the people
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.640]  in the press who were there was in the hallway outside the big keynote hall and on the upstairs
[35:22.640 --> 35:31.040]  of Moscone West. And everybody was doing the same thing. It was everybody had their personal iPhone
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.800]  3G or 3GS, whatever they had, and looking at it side by side with their demo units and being like,
[35:36.800 --> 35:45.600]  huh, my phone is garbage. Everybody. It's one thing to have Steve Jobs tell you on stage that
[35:45.600 --> 35:50.480]  it's four times the pixels in double resolution and you can't see the individual pixels. That's
[35:50.480 --> 35:54.400]  what we mean by retina. But when you were looking at it, it was like, holy cow.
[35:54.400 --> 36:01.360]  But, and then pretty quickly they moved the Mac there. The Mac couldn't move to retina
[36:01.360 --> 36:06.800]  displays with the snap of the finger like the iPhone could. And even still to this day,
[36:06.800 --> 36:11.520]  there are people out there, I'm sure there are people listening to us who have non-retina
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.160]  external display. You can't buy a MacBook without a retina display, but you can certainly hook up
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.920]  like a 4K display that's technically sub-retina. The Mac's a little different than the iPhone where
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.800]  the resolution is flexible. But where I'm going though is that effectively once the iPhone went
[36:28.800 --> 36:35.920]  retina, we got spoiled and everything had to be retina. And so what I'm curious about with the
[36:35.920 --> 36:43.440]  headset is if they had, is there some alternate world where they'd shipped the headset years ago
[36:43.440 --> 36:51.280]  and it was only 1080p and you could see pixels and we just had to wait four years to go to retina?
[36:51.280 --> 37:01.360]  Or is there something about the VR experience that demands retina display? You know, that
[37:02.320 --> 37:09.680]  being able to see pixels takes you out of it in a way that's inherent to the VR experience.
[37:10.320 --> 37:17.920]  Yeah, I think with early VR headsets, so 2016 you look at like the HTC Vive. One of the reasons why
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.720]  it was so pixelated or perceivably so was that it was an OLED display using a Pentile sub-pixel
[37:24.720 --> 37:30.960]  arrangement. And so you didn't really have a red, blue and green for every single pixel.
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.280]  And the spacing that they had in between the pixels as a result of having to use
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.640]  Fresnel lenses and basically magnify into these displays was something that they called the
[37:40.640 --> 37:46.160]  screen door effect. And it's quite a literal term where if you're looking through a screen door
[37:46.160 --> 37:50.880]  that's supposed to stop bugs and mosquitoes from coming in your home, you can still see out and
[37:50.880 --> 37:57.040]  through it. But there's kind of this like gray moir� kind of, it's like you're looking through
[37:57.040 --> 38:05.280]  a screen door and that translated into VR. And very quickly, in order to pursue higher refresh
[38:05.280 --> 38:10.960]  rates, which are important to decrease nausea, because when you move your head, you want the
[38:10.960 --> 38:17.600]  display to refresh at the rate that your eyeballs would expect the real world to. And to get rid of
[38:17.600 --> 38:23.600]  that screen door effect, most VR headsets move over to LCD. And so the Valve Index and a couple of
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.960]  still the highest end headsets on the market are high refresh LCD, but LCD comes with its own
[38:28.960 --> 38:33.520]  downsides, right? You can't get true blacks out of LCD. And when you're strapped into a pair of
[38:33.520 --> 38:40.800]  goggles where there's no outside light coming in, it's not very convincing to have your blacks be
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.560]  colored gray, because you do still have the ability to look beyond the field of view of
[38:46.560 --> 38:51.760]  the headset. So if you really move your eyeballs, you can see past the screen and it's just black,
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.640]  because that's the end of the display. And so when you have the true black of a non-display area,
[38:56.640 --> 39:01.760]  and then a very, very, very bright gray that's trying to simulate black because of an LCD,
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.440]  it's just not a very convincing effect, but it's better than having to deal with wanting to hurl
[39:07.440 --> 39:11.840]  because the display is too slow or making it look like you're looking through a screen door.
[39:13.840 --> 39:18.160]  Well, I'll just say on that point that I think that explains why Apple Watch has always been
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.680]  OLED. I don't think there was any chance possible that they were ever going to launch Apple Watch
[39:23.680 --> 39:30.560]  with an LCD display, because especially in the first couple of generations, the way that the
[39:30.560 --> 39:38.480]  black bezel around the display is indistinguishable from the black of most of the Apple Watch faces
[39:39.200 --> 39:43.760]  completely hides where the display is. And especially on the series one, two,
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.440]  or zero, one, two, and three, the screen was just a perfect rectangle with a sharp corner.
[39:49.440 --> 39:51.040]  And it was quite small.
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.840]  And you never saw it though. It was completely, it created the illusion that there was no display.
[39:57.840 --> 40:01.360]  And I kind of feel like you need that same effect with the goggles.
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.600]  Yeah, I think so too. It's not completely necessary, but it certainly helps with
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.400]  immersion. Where people, I think, get fixated, and this is where I'm really interested to see
[40:12.400 --> 40:19.360]  where Apple goes with this, is convincing a greater number of your senses to a greater
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.320]  effect that it's real life, right? The best VR experience I've ever had,
[40:24.320 --> 40:31.040]  and I've yet to go back and replicate it by any other newer headset, was clear back in 2018.
[40:31.040 --> 40:35.840]  There was this company called The Void. They've since gone under. But what they did,
[40:35.840 --> 40:40.560]  they were trying to work with amusement parks. They were in downtown Disney for a while.
[40:40.560 --> 40:45.040]  And I know about them because they're a company that was based not too far from where I'm at.
[40:45.040 --> 40:50.560]  And they would trick a greater quantity of your senses because they knew that putting a pair of
[40:50.560 --> 40:57.920]  goggles on wasn't convincing enough. So they would allow you to track your body in a warehouse.
[40:57.920 --> 41:04.320]  So rather than stand in this little five by five square, you would be in an enormous space and it
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.960]  would be able to see wherever you were going and it would translate that into the game that they
[41:08.960 --> 41:16.480]  had developed. And beyond that, they had trackable objects. So this was all in a black room, but one
[41:16.480 --> 41:24.000]  of the most kind of impressive, convincing things about this was that you put the goggles on and you
[41:24.000 --> 41:29.840]  were in this rain forest approaching the entrance to a cave. And as you walk towards the cave, you
[41:29.840 --> 41:34.560]  saw a torch that was on the wall. And there was a little prompt that said, grab the torch. I had
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.200]  gloves on and the gloves were tracked in VR. And as I went to grab the torch, it was just a little
[41:39.200 --> 41:45.760]  piece of wood shaped into the shape of a cone. But as I grabbed it, I saw my hand grab it,
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.200]  in virtual reality, and not only was I able to feel the torch, but they had a little bit of an
[41:51.200 --> 41:57.520]  infrared heater at the top of that piece of wood. And so there was heat coming off of the torch.
[41:57.520 --> 42:01.760]  And there were a bunch of other tricks they did too, where you'd approach a river and they had
[42:01.760 --> 42:07.600]  a fan that was turned on that was blowing steam at you or mist. And so it was kind of this effect of,
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.280]  oh, I'm close to the water. There's water splashing on my face. And it did a really good
[42:11.280 --> 42:18.400]  job at convincing you that this was real, even though it was a lot of cheap gimmicks to convince
[42:18.400 --> 42:23.760]  you that you were in the real world because the headset was kind of crappy. And so even if you
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.720]  have something that doesn't quite convincingly get you there, there are a lot of other things that
[42:28.720 --> 42:35.440]  they can do to make it seem more real. The Valve Index a few years ago added the Knuckles
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.680]  controllers. They use ultrasonic sensors and a couple of other, they're capacitive buttons,
[42:39.680 --> 42:45.120]  right? So you can rest your finger on the button without pushing it. And it shows that in the game.
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.800]  And it's just little stuff like that, where it can more convincingly distract you from the fact that
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.760]  your vision isn't quite what you get in the real world. And that's where I'm interested to see if
[42:55.760 --> 43:01.360]  Apple's hand tracking and some of the contextual and kind of environmental stuff that they can do.
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.880]  Sound is another big one. If they can do a bunch of these small things to distract you from the
[43:06.880 --> 43:12.800]  idea that yeah, even at 4k, this still isn't quite as good as human vision, but it doesn't matter.
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.320]  And I think that they will be able to pull it off if they can do even a remotely decent job.
[43:18.320 --> 43:25.440]  Because with most headsets nowadays, I think that it's kind of like you mentioned, where you your
[43:25.440 --> 43:29.200]  eyes fool your brain into thinking they're better than they are. It's the same thing with the
[43:29.200 --> 43:33.280]  headset. Once you've put a headset on for 15-20 minutes, you put it on at first you're like,
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.240]  Whoa, this is not really what real life looks like. But after 20 minutes, your brain just
[43:38.240 --> 43:44.640]  remaps what your vision is inside of the goggles. And so it really does become pretty convincing
[43:44.640 --> 43:51.280]  pretty quickly. I don't have tons of experience with VR, as I said, but one of the experiences I
[43:51.280 --> 44:02.720]  did have was a couple years ago, it was 95% sure when the iMac Pro came out. And they wanted to,
[44:02.720 --> 44:10.640]  it was at Apple's sort of semi secretive New York mansion that they don't want people posting
[44:10.640 --> 44:16.800]  pictures of etc. But I didn't have to go out to California, but it was in New York.
[44:16.800 --> 44:25.680]  And they had a bunch of rooms with different stations showing how great the iMac Pro is there.
[44:25.680 --> 44:33.600]  And the developer one was really interesting just because it was compiling an iPhone app,
[44:33.600 --> 44:40.320]  a big iPhone app with lots of source code and also running parallels or something,
[44:40.320 --> 44:47.280]  running an entire Windows VM. And in Windows, they were compiling a C++ app at the same time
[44:47.280 --> 44:55.280]  while exporting a 4K video. And the demo for the press was, come behind here and put your hand on
[44:55.280 --> 45:02.480]  it and feel how cool it is. And it's not making noise. The iMac Pro, it was Intel, but it presaged
[45:03.040 --> 45:08.080]  where Apple wanted to go with their own Silicon. We'll get to that later in the show. But they had
[45:08.080 --> 45:15.760]  a VR room and it was the HTC Vive, but hooked up I think to the iMac Pros. And they had a couple
[45:15.760 --> 45:20.400]  of demos they let us play. And like you said, I don't know, at least 20 minutes. When I took
[45:20.400 --> 45:29.520]  them off, I was so disoriented. But one of the weird parts of it was with the Vive. And
[45:29.520 --> 45:35.200]  there was sort of a Guitar Hero game that I was playing where it was music and things are coming
[45:35.200 --> 45:41.840]  at me and I'm slashing at these things. Yeah, I think that might've been it. But whatever it was,
[45:41.840 --> 45:47.040]  I didn't have legs. And it sounds funny, like we're saying this, and if anybody's out there
[45:47.040 --> 45:51.760]  and they've never really used a VR headset, it sounds funny to complain about the lack of legs,
[45:52.400 --> 45:59.760]  but it's really weird. Because you put it on and you're like, okay, instantly you're like,
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.640]  this is weird. I'm looking in a goggle and blah, blah, blah. And if it works within minutes,
[46:06.640 --> 46:14.480]  you are immersed to some degree or another. And once you're immersed, I don't have legs.
[46:14.480 --> 46:21.200]  It's so weird. And you do, but this is where I'm so interested to see what, as I've written about
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.120]  at length, what the hell does Apple think we're going to do with the headset? Because there's
[46:25.120 --> 46:30.800]  weird things like everybody always goes to the Star Trek holodeck, which was a great gimmick
[46:30.800 --> 46:37.120]  for the show. A fantastic gimmick, right? Where, oh my God, we've got to do 20 episodes of Star
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.600]  Trek a year. Where are we going to come up with these stories? Well, we could just send our
[46:41.600 --> 46:46.800]  beloved cast and crew to Victorian England for a Sherlock Holmes style episode, because we're
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.680]  going to put them in the holodeck. But you could walk around the holodeck. You actually,
[46:51.680 --> 46:58.720]  the gimmick, I mean, they always sort of ignored the fact that eventually they'd walk into the
[46:58.720 --> 47:05.200]  walls, right? Because it was like gymnasium size, but there are walls, but it's weird. You put on
[47:05.200 --> 47:13.600]  VR headset and you might want to play a game or something where you move, but you can't actually
[47:13.600 --> 47:19.760]  walk, right? Because you'd be like walking into your desk or walking, walking into people or
[47:19.760 --> 47:29.680]  something. It's very, I guess for games, it makes a lot more sense if it's a vehicle game where
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.080]  you're the pilot of a ship or driving a car, because then it makes sense that you're not
[47:34.080 --> 47:42.400]  actually moving your real human legs. Yeah. Although there are newer, I mean, newer headsets
[47:42.400 --> 47:48.800]  can track a lot really well. What was always weird about those early headsets is you actually were
[47:48.800 --> 47:54.880]  able to move around in a space and you could play a game. You lay down on the ground and your vision
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.280]  is going to go down to the floor in the game, but you look down and all you see is some weird
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.960]  floating hands that are disembodied from the rest of your and you're like, hold on. But more recent
[48:04.960 --> 48:11.760]  headsets, particularly with the meta quest pro, not only did they have hand tracking already that
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.400]  Apple is alleged to be implementing and they actually even have the same engagement mechanism.
[48:16.400 --> 48:23.680]  Gurman said that the, how Apple intends to have you interact with the UI is to take your thumb
[48:23.680 --> 48:29.440]  and your index finger and pinch together. And when you pinch that basically acts as a click. But
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.480]  Facebook has already had that exact implementation for a couple of years now. And it works actually
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.040]  pretty well. And you can track your fingers remarkably well in this, in the Facebook
[48:39.040 --> 48:44.000]  headsets. And they even have full body tracking now. So you can see your arms and you can see
[48:44.000 --> 48:51.360]  your legs in VR and it doesn't have the same, it can't perfectly emulate the mobility of your legs,
[48:51.360 --> 48:56.640]  but it does a convincing enough job that you're like, yeah, I'm there. And so that's where I'm
[48:56.640 --> 49:01.440]  really interested to see what Apple has planned for this headset, because the hardware is impressive
[49:01.440 --> 49:08.320]  as it sounds like they're going to be implementing. I think that the bar, they're already there. They
[49:08.320 --> 49:12.320]  could release the same headset that Facebook has out. They could release the same headset that
[49:12.320 --> 49:19.840]  Valve has out. And it would be sufficiently good to fool the senses. Where that convincing ends
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.800]  is once you enter the, and you said it yourself, what am I supposed to do with this?
[49:24.800 --> 49:30.560]  Because if you have a limited games catalog, or there's very few applications for where this might
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.840]  work, or it's just a display for your Mac, but instead of looking at the display on your Mac,
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.480]  now you're looking at a bigger display on your goggles. I don't know if that's a convincing
[49:40.480 --> 49:46.000]  enough reason to want to get and utilize the headset. And I think that developers,
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.160]  as always has been the case in Apple's product lineup, will come up with incredible ideas and
[49:52.160 --> 49:58.320]  applications for this headset. But I also think that Apple has to sell people from day one,
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.360]  because we've known this has been coming for years. And so they can't say,
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.240]  hey, this is really powerful. We don't really know what to do with it yet, but here you figure it
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.320]  out. They've got to have something that has to blow the mind. And based on, again, Gurman's
[50:12.320 --> 50:20.160]  latest rumors from power on that, they have dozens, he said, of experiences because they
[50:20.160 --> 50:25.680]  know that they can't release it with the shallow to empty catalog. There's gotta be a reason to
[50:25.680 --> 50:32.960]  own one from day one. Yeah. I kind of feel like that's the long story short of why did this
[50:32.960 --> 50:40.400]  product take so long to come out? It's been rumored longer than anything. Maybe if we
[50:40.400 --> 50:50.400]  make an exception for the car, but the car project by all accounts has never really coalesced around
[50:50.400 --> 50:58.160]  a, okay, this is it. Whereas this headset keeps changing. But there's a basic idea that it's going
[50:58.160 --> 51:06.480]  to be expensive. You put it on, it's not glasses, it's full on immersive VR. And then if you do see
[51:06.480 --> 51:12.720]  through to the real world for an AR experience, it'll be cameras shooting out, projecting the
[51:12.720 --> 51:18.960]  real world into the goggles in front of you. I think the biggest reason it's taken so long is
[51:19.680 --> 51:27.360]  building up the library of experiences. Right. And I hope, yeah, I hope too. I hope
[51:27.360 --> 51:36.160]  I really not. Oh yeah. But I do think it is sort of a, if you're looking for, and I guess
[51:37.760 --> 51:43.760]  maybe that's the trap I've fallen into is with my writing speculating, what would the use case
[51:43.760 --> 51:49.680]  I'm looking for like the heroic, this is the one thing you're going to want to spend all this money
[51:49.680 --> 51:54.400]  to get this thing for. And maybe that's the wrong way of thinking about it. Right. It's like,
[51:54.400 --> 52:01.440]  Hey, it does a dozen interesting things. And for you, maybe it's numbers five, seven,
[52:01.440 --> 52:07.120]  and nine out of the 12. And for me, it's two, four, and six. And these are the things I really
[52:07.120 --> 52:13.920]  want to do. And I guess that's true of like most Apple products, right? Everybody who uses a Mac
[52:13.920 --> 52:21.200]  does different things on it, right? You Quinn Nelson are keenly interested in the performance
[52:21.200 --> 52:28.080]  of exporting 4k or I don't know, do you shoot 8k? I mean, but high res, but high res video.
[52:29.360 --> 52:34.880]  And there's lots and lots of millions of Mac users out there who never export a video in their life,
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.560]  right? They might shoot video on their phone and all they do is sync it to their photo.
[52:40.560 --> 52:46.480]  So I guess that's the sort of thing, but I really, I still don't know. I don't know.
[52:46.480 --> 52:53.280]  It is interesting because it's, I think it's one of the rare exceptions where we,
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.800]  I guess it's not a rare exception because it's often that we know what the hardware
[52:56.800 --> 53:00.480]  is going to be before. We really know what the software is going to be because supply chain links
[53:00.480 --> 53:06.160]  are, are so much harder to kind of buckle down than, than internal to Apple. But it's really
[53:06.160 --> 53:13.600]  the first time that we don't really know anything about the way that it will be navigated from a
[53:13.600 --> 53:19.360]  user experience standpoint, how the UI is going to work, what APIs will be available. And so
[53:20.320 --> 53:26.240]  that makes it both really exciting and also really, I don't want to say terrifying, but
[53:27.280 --> 53:33.120]  I really hope they hit the mark. But, and this is where maybe the Apple apologist in me will
[53:33.120 --> 53:40.000]  come out. There's been, the wave has passed for money in VR. So if Apple was focused on
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.400]  market capitalization and getting something out that people were going to buy in mass,
[53:44.400 --> 53:50.880]  they would have released a headset three, four years ago, when that second generation of,
[53:50.880 --> 53:57.200]  of kind of PC VR headsets were coming out, but they didn't. And right now is not the time to
[53:57.200 --> 54:05.440]  release a VR headset. VR is dying pretty much everywhere. But the fact that Apple seems to be
[54:05.440 --> 54:10.400]  ready to do it doesn't make me think that it's a sunk cost fallacy because look at the car. They,
[54:10.400 --> 54:16.720]  they have no problem deferring stuff for years if it's not ready. So I think it is, but I just
[54:16.720 --> 54:21.360]  don't know what ready is because we have no context for what it's supposed to be because
[54:21.360 --> 54:26.880]  no one's done a good job with it yet. And that makes it really, really exciting to me anyway.
[54:26.880 --> 54:34.080]  Right. There's a fundamental, and like you said, there's, it sounds like Apple fandom to say,
[54:34.080 --> 54:42.960]  I just have faith that the people who have that decision-making authority, Jaws and Federighi and
[54:42.960 --> 54:52.320]  even up to Tim Cook, that there's, is this good enough? And if it's not, then don't release it.
[54:52.320 --> 54:58.160]  Right. And their Apple's not a struggling company. Right. So they're not under desperate pressure
[54:58.160 --> 55:05.680]  for that, but on the other hand, maybe, right. That's sort of the excitement is what if,
[55:05.680 --> 55:13.360]  what if, what if they are too insular and they've convinced themselves that this is a thing and they
[55:13.360 --> 55:20.880]  release it and it's not a thing. Right. Yeah. And by all accounts, it's not like the iPod
[55:20.880 --> 55:27.040]  or the watch, which was like, Hey, for the first generation, take a flyer and buy this thing.
[55:27.040 --> 55:34.480]  It's 400 bucks. Supposedly it's $3,000, even if that's off by a factor of two. Right. And it's
[55:34.480 --> 55:42.000]  a $1,500 headset, which would be impressive, an impressive win versus the rumors, but still,
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.760]  that's a lot of money. A $1,500 headset is a ton of money. It is. And there's no way it's going
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.480]  to be 1,500 bucks, at least not if it's shipping with the specs that are rumored. I mean,
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.520]  there's projections that even at the $3,000 expected sales price, it's going to be a loss
[55:57.520 --> 56:00.480]  leader. They're not going to make it. Not only will they break it, they're not even breaking
[56:00.480 --> 56:07.040]  even. Right. Every headset loses money. So that really even further convinces me that Apple
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.320]  thinks it's a big deal and they think it's the future and it might not be ready for the masses.
[56:12.320 --> 56:18.080]  Right. At $3,000, it's not going to become the next iPhone, but if it can lay the foundation
[56:18.080 --> 56:25.280]  for what will be in three or five or 10 years, then that's sweet. But they've got to hit it
[56:25.280 --> 56:28.640]  out of the park from day one. Otherwise everyone's going to go, yeah, well, I don't want a cheaper,
[56:28.640 --> 56:36.160]  crappier version of that. It's not even good. Yeah. The 1984 Macintosh costs $2,500. And so
[56:36.160 --> 56:43.360]  let me hear, let's do this. $2,500 inflation calculator. It's something, I think I did this
[56:43.360 --> 56:50.960]  recently. It's like $7,000 in today's money, something like that. Let's see here. Well,
[56:50.960 --> 56:55.440]  it's something like $7,000. So imagine if Apple came out with a new computer today and it was
[56:55.440 --> 57:02.000]  $7,000. That's the entry model. That's it. There's no way cheaper. People would say,
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.120]  oh my God, you're out of your mind. No one's going to buy a $7,000 computer. But that's what
[57:07.120 --> 57:16.160]  they hate. That's what the Macintosh costs in 1984. And it took a long time for computers to be
[57:16.160 --> 57:22.080]  of interest to the general population. I'm not saying that this headset is going to take
[57:22.080 --> 57:30.960]  10 years before it hits critical mass. I think things move faster today and it's only five.
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.840]  Right. Right. Take three. Yeah. Super exciting. All right. Let me take a break here and thank
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.360]  our next sponsor. It's our good friends at Trade Coffee. Trade Coffee. If you love drinking coffee
[57:41.360 --> 57:46.640]  every morning, and I do, you have to check out Trade Coffee. Trade makes it effortless to brew
[57:46.640 --> 57:52.320]  better coffee at home. They empower coffee lovers to discover better coffee because they deliver
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.920]  fresh coffee right to your door. If you've been getting your coffee from the grocery store and
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.080]  drinking the same coffee every day, you really need to try something better because coffee that
[58:02.080 --> 58:08.240]  sits on the shelf, it really is. I know it doesn't look like a produce, like fresh fruit, and it
[58:09.440 --> 58:15.600]  doesn't rot like an apple that just sits there. But coffee goes bad. Roasted coffee really does
[58:15.600 --> 58:20.880]  not have a long shelf life to really be the freshest it can be. And once you get used to
[58:20.880 --> 58:27.920]  freshly roasted coffee, you instantly taste the difference. And it's very difficult to go back to
[58:27.920 --> 58:34.800]  this black coffee that you get from a shelf. Trade Coffee works with... It's a subscription service,
[58:34.800 --> 58:39.360]  and you pick how often you want to get new coffees. After you get coffees,
[58:39.360 --> 58:46.320]  they come from local roasters all over the country. Over 55 roasters right here in the US,
[58:46.320 --> 58:52.480]  independent small roasters, offering over 450 different roasts. That's how many different types
[58:52.480 --> 58:58.400]  of coffee they have. You get your coffee, then a couple of days later, Trade sends you an email,
[58:58.400 --> 59:02.480]  and it says, hey, do you want to rate the coffee we just sent you last week? And you could give it
[59:02.480 --> 59:07.040]  a thumbs up, a thumbs like, ah, this isn't really for me. And then they use that information to
[59:07.040 --> 59:12.320]  dial in the sort of coffee you're more likely to like. And I'm telling you, it works. I've
[59:12.320 --> 59:17.600]  been subscribed, I think, for a full year at this point to Trade Coffee. And the coffee I get from
[59:17.600 --> 59:23.920]  that, I've always been happy with it, but it really is more the type of coffee John Gruber
[59:23.920 --> 59:29.440]  likes at this point when I get the Trade Coffee. It is so super easy and convenient. If you go on
[59:29.440 --> 59:34.240]  vacation, if you're going away, if you find out that whatever you picked for your frequency
[59:34.240 --> 59:40.640]  is too much or too little, it is easy to adjust or pause your subscription at any time. I can't
[59:40.640 --> 59:44.800]  say enough good things about it. I really like it. Upgrade your morning routine with better coffee.
[59:44.800 --> 59:50.320]  Right now, Trade is offering our viewers, our listeners of this show, a free bag of coffee
[59:50.320 --> 59:58.880]  with any subscription at www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show. That's www.drinktrade.com
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.280]  slash the talk show for a free bag of coffee with any subscription purchase,
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:09.040]  www.drinktrade.com slash the talk show. You a coffee drinker, Quinn?
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.640]  I'm not.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.960]  Yeah. You don't strike me as you. You've got like natural energy. Me, I need it. I need
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:22.560]  the caffeinated boost. Another of your recent episodes that I really liked and it felt,
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.680]  it was a little sad. You tied it in with Gordon Moore's passing. It was a little serendipitous.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.600]  I get the feeling you were working on a video about Apple Silicon and it just so happens that
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.320]  Gordon Moore happened to die. It's not trash. He lived a wonderful life, died a billionaire
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.680]  at age 91 in Hawaii surrounded by his family. I mean, we've all got to die at some point.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.520]  That seems like he went out on top.
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.120]  Good way to go. Yeah. Yeah. No, that video, not only did we start writing that video when
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:58.320]  Gordon Moore was still alive, but that was a video that had been scrapped and then salvaged
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.040]  and then scrapped again. I mean, I probably started that script eight months ago and just
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.760]  never got it in a spot where I was happy with it. And so I'd come back to it and then try to
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.240]  rework it and finally got it to a point where I thought it was worth releasing.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.680]  Fascinating insight because I do feel going back to when I first started talking to you about the
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:25.120]  art of being a professional video maker on YouTube is, and it's probably too for writing too. Like,
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  I aim to write articles that go down easy. My vision is you start reading something I
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.880]  wrote that's long and next thing you know, you're at the end. You can't help yourself.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:40.800]  And videos are sort of like that too, right? When you hit it, it looks effortless,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:49.440]  right? And it's counterintuitive. The better your video is, the less likely someone who enjoys it
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.680]  is to say, wow, you must have spent a ton of time on that. Because instead it feels like,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.640]  oh, you had some thoughts on Apple Silicon and read them in front of a camera.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.480]  Right. Right. Yeah.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:10.400]  Yeah. But I thought it was really good. I feel like one of the ongoing themes of the current
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:23.440]  moment this decade is Apple's shift to their own Silicon for the Mac. And I frequently,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.560]  it's because I love The Verge so much and Monica Chin is like their PC laptop reviewer.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:40.240]  And I don't want to single her out too often. But I do feel that for anybody who's trying to
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:48.800]  maintain cross-platform, not objectivity per se, but objectivity, but also just the overall
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.160]  keep your feet or keep some of your fingers on all sides of the industry and knowing the state
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:01.680]  of the art of PC hardware and Mac hardware. I feel like it's broken people's brains,
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:09.920]  how far ahead Apple Silicon is over the state of the art in the Intel or Intel and AMD x86 world.
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:16.880]  Yeah. And it's interesting because they're ahead in areas where I think people often
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.520]  don't realize or don't understand because the M series processors are objectively fast. I mean,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.880]  they're impressive pieces of Silicon, but they're not the fastest chips you can buy.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:35.600]  If you have the money, you can get a much faster Intel chip for not even just a desktop,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.200]  but for a laptop. The difference is that they draw incredible amounts of power.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.040]  They create incredible amounts of heat. And there are areas where the Apple Silicon chips,
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:54.240]  for reasons that we can get into, just frankly outperform chips that are designed for general
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:01.120]  purpose compute. The way the industry evolved up to this point, no single company ever had
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:10.160]  a fork like this where the performance metrics of the Silicon just are so totally different.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:16.240]  It really is like two universes at this point because in the Intel word, and I'm saying Intel
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:23.600]  just to mean x86, because x86 seems like more of a mouthful, but it's like you said, you can buy a
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:31.760]  faster computer, but it has the trade-offs that we spent 50 years or longer. Whenever you want
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:38.560]  to go back to the beginning of the semiconductor industry with Gordon Moore in the 1960s, faster
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:45.280]  means more power. More power means if it's battery operated, shorter battery life, and it means more
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:53.040]  heat, right? And if you want less heat and longer battery life, then you get a slower computer.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:00.080]  And these trade-offs were very well understood. And Apple Silicon really is the sort of,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.920]  you can have your cake and eat it too. And you get very good performance, excellent performance.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:14.240]  Excellent performance. And they run incredibly cool and they last laughably long. It's ridiculous
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:23.840]  how long my MacBook Pro lasts on battery. It makes me laugh. I still vividly remember
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:32.160]  how cool it was to be able to watch video on a laptop while flying on an airplane and not being
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.080]  at the liberty of the seat back, which may or may not even have an entertainment system. It's like,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.960]  I can watch my own movies. But a flight from Philadelphia to California used to,
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.120]  if you got like a half an hour before they let you take your laptop out and then you start watching
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.720]  and then you get close to landing and they're like, put everything under the seat or whatever,
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.000]  the battery would be dead if you were watching movies on a cross country flight. Now,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.240]  it's like your battery's fine. You could like get off the plane and sit down and do work.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:09.600]  It's for people who aren't, and I know it's, again, it's decades long that there are some
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.960]  people who just don't like Apple products. And for good reasons, perhaps that they just don't
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:22.480]  like the way Mac OS works. They prefer Windows or a big reason for people who are enthusiasts
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:30.080]  is gaming. The PC gaming industry literally does not include the Mac. We really do mean
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:42.080]  Windows PCs when we talk about PC gaming. But it just feels like there's a sort of denial
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.320]  about how far behind the Intel state of the art is silicon wise on these price per performance
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:55.280]  metrics. And that's where I think it's most important to kind of highlight because
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:04.080]  it's so perfectly Apple. I mean, for years, take the 2016 MacBook Pro. There were years
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.800]  where you and I and pretty much every other person was saying, these computers are too hot.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.520]  They don't have sufficient cooling. It's so bad and they get so hot that it starts to destroy
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:21.440]  the keyboard. That's not very good. And there's all these problems associated with trying to get
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.160]  rid of this heat. It's affecting the battery life. Please, Apple, just make thicker laptops.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.320]  It's not that big of a concession. It'll just make the experience better.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.480]  Meanwhile, they were rapidly working as fast as they could to say, no, no, no, no,
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.960]  that's not what you want. You just need a processor that draws one fifth the amount
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.800]  of power of what your current one does. And then it can be thin and then it can be light.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.800]  And you can still have all the battery and all the thermal headroom and everything that you
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:54.640]  could ever want. And that's why they've been so impressive. And then you consider the fact that
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:08:04.560]  Apple is, as we approach quite literally processes that are at an atomic level,
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.240]  we can't really make chips that much more dense. And that's why I talked about Gordon Moore,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.880]  this idea that every two years, the transistors doubled. That's not happening anymore because
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.960]  we're at three nanometers and rapidly shooting, you can't get smaller than an atom
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.800]  unless we get to the point where we're not even relying on silicon. And there's some new black
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.160]  Swan of a technology that comes out and says, yeah, everything you think you know about chip
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.120]  design, we're going to flip it on its head, but that doesn't seem to be happening.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:39.680]  So in the next few years, and it still might be 10 or 15 or 20 years, but in the next couple
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:49.120]  decades, we're stuck. And so it has to get to the point where the software defines what the hardware
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.840]  is going to be not the other way around, which is how it's been for decades where we can just say,
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.400]  yeah, whatever the software does, we can run it on this hardware, we can throw power at it,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.120]  and we can throw horsepower. And these general purpose cores are going to do that work.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.080]  Now, there was a time when that started to deviate, you look at GPUs
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:16.480]  that are now used for compute purposes, but there's becoming more and more sub processes,
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.080]  hardware blocks and coprocessors that are making their way into the server industry.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.200]  You've got AI accelerators, you've got FPGAs, you've got specialized ASIC hardware that is
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.800]  designed to do a task. And it does it really, really, really well. Apple's done that with
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.880]  Apple Silicon. They've got the neural engine, they've got an AI accelerator, they've got
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:45.920]  a coprocessor to handle image rasterization and sharpening, they've got... I'm blanking on all
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.480]  the stuff that they've got hardware accelerators for video, they've got that ProRes media engine,
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.480]  they've got an H.264 engine. And so that's not going to cover everyone's use cases.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:02.720]  But we showed in a video we did last year, that even though in benchmarks, an entry level,
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:11.440]  a $1,000 PC will still outperform a $1,000 M1 Mac Mini. Once you start doing something
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.800]  like exporting a video, the Mac Mini will crush it, even though from a benchmark standpoint,
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:23.360]  it should perform worse. And it's because that hardware from within Apple Silicon is utilizing
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:31.120]  specialized APIs to run on specific hardware in a particular way that's designed for a specific
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.560]  task. And I think that's where stuff is going to continue to go, and why Apple Silicon will
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:44.720]  continue to be king, at least in the mobile space. Where I'm curious is that this was supposed to
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:53.440]  scale to the Mac Pro. That once we don't care about power consumption, that doesn't matter how
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.880]  many watts we're drawing from the wall, we just want balls to the wall, fastest Mac we can make.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.880]  We haven't gotten that. And it seems that they're struggling at being able to pull that off. So it'll
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.480]  be interesting to see what that is when it comes. And that's exactly where I'm going with this,
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.160]  because it's in this run up to WWDC. I mean, clearly, we all expect the headset. And if the
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:21.600]  headset does not come, if WWDC's keynote comes and goes, and there's no mention of the headset,
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.240]  all any of us are going to be talking about at 12 noon Pacific, as Tim Cook says, thank you,
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.560]  and have a great week at WWDC. All we're going to be talking about is where the hell was the
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.440]  headset? Where's the headset, right? So let's just assume the headset is coming, right? And
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:44.400]  it's obviously going to be a flagship announcement, a huge chunk of the keynote. Software story,
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.560]  presumably, we'll see Mike Rockwell, their head of VR, he was on my show, I think 2018,
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:56.320]  which was a long time ago. Clearly, all of the AR stuff they've been working on with iOS
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.920]  over the years is moving. It's all setting the stage for a device that's AR first. It's not
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.680]  supposed to be what you do on a little five inch phone. But I do think we're so head... Again,
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.080]  we just spend an hour talking about the headset here on the show. But I think the Mac Pro is
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:18.960]  coming too, right? Because if not, again, if the WWDC in six weeks comes and goes, and there's no
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.640]  Mac Pro, where the hell is the Mac Pro, right? I mean...
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:32.240]  Yeah. Well, it's already a year behind, right? I mean, I saw an article the other day,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.120]  I think it was Mac Rumors that said, it's been 530 days since John Turness said,
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:39.440]  the Mac Pro's for another day.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.200]  Yeah. I can't believe it's that long. I guess so though, because it was...
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.240]  Well, yeah, it was...
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.680]  I think it was late 2021.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:53.280]  Right. But he said it as they debuted the Mac Studio. And at this point, I would say the Mac
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:13:03.280]  Studio is late, right? For an M2. And Garmin's reporting is... And I'm not sure on this front,
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:10.240]  whether Garmin is sourced or he's sort of put on his pundit hat, right? And I feel like that's
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:17.680]  where Garmin often falls short is where he's drawing conclusions, as opposed to just reporting
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.040]  what is incredibly well-placed sources, right? I mean, unprecedented sources.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:33.840]  But I'm curious your thoughts on... So the Garmin line is something to the effect that there was a...
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:39.200]  I don't know what adjective they would have put plans for. The way that the M1 Ultra is like
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.120]  four M1s put together. There'd be one with like eight or 16. I don't know.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.280]  The Jade 4C, I think the internal name was. Yeah.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.440]  And that that got scrapped or wasn't feasible, whatever, something, something happened.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.680]  And it's left them in a situation where the most technically advanced Mac Pro
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:10.240]  wouldn't be that much more technically capable than a M2 Mac Studio. And so therefore,
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.160]  the Mac Studio might skip a generation to let the Mac Pro have its year in the sun,
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.160]  for lack of a better analogy. That doesn't make sense to me.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.080]  No, I was going to say my question becomes why, because what's the point of the Mac Pro if it
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.520]  doesn't do anything that the studio can't? Right. It doesn't make sense to me that it
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:36.320]  even exists. Right. If you can put it into an adorable little Mac Studio sized case,
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:43.360]  why not? And I know the John Siracusa in me, anybody who's sensitive to noise,
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.760]  the Mac Studio, when pressed, makes noise that other...
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.800]  Because it's pushing the limits of Apple's Silicon. So one argument would be, well, yeah,
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.240]  the fact that it does make some audible noise, right? Our standard is no noise at all. That's
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.040]  where we are with Apple Silicon, right? So, yeah. So why not make it a little bigger?
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.320]  But to me, that just means make the Mac Studio a little bigger. And it is... I always say
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:23.040]  Cupertino-ology is... It's kind of my racket. This is what I do is sort of... But it's like
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.680]  when I was a kid and the Cold War was going on, they called it Kremlinology, right? Where
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.520]  there were experts in the US State Department or governments all around the world who read Pravda.
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.280]  And every single headline was technically a lie, but you could read between the lines and figure
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:46.240]  out the truth, right? So Apple doesn't lie, but they give clues. John Ternus saying that we've got
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.080]  one more thing to come, the Mac Pro, but that's a story for another day,
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.080]  why would he say that? That's so un-Apple-like, unless he knew it's coming. And even though,
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.160]  did he know at that time it was still over a year away or did something happen in the intern?
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:09.600]  I think it must have been the latter. So what we do know is that fabbing and bending silicon
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:16.000]  is extraordinarily hard, especially at the scale that Apple is doing it. And the chiplet is
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:25.760]  by design to try and reduce the error rate that you have by making a crazy, enormous chip, right?
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.720]  Because you're going to have failures. I mean, if you look at... They call it silicon binning,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:36.720]  that's why Intel processors are generally the same socket size and they have the same number
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.240]  of pins because an i5 processor was an i7. And that's why Intel processors are
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.040]  the same socket size and they have the same number of pins because an i5 processor
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.080]  was an i7 that didn't make the cut. And then they just disabled sectors of the CPU that
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.800]  didn't meet the expectations to make it an i7. That effectively is what Apple has done in the
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:04.720]  past. And it's what they're doing with the M1X versus M1 Pro. The M1 itself is a separate chip,
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.000]  but the Max and Pro, those are just bin chips. And so it's possible that the chiplet design is,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.200]  okay, let's take four M1 Maxes or M2 Maxes or whatever it's going to be at this point
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.400]  and glue them all together and then we'll just make a mega chip. It's possible that that didn't
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.600]  end up being as easy as they thought it was going to be. But it does seem strange. The only way I
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:32.640]  can envision a Mac Pro coming out without any additional hardware features, it's just an M2
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.560]  Max Studio, is if not only did they make it quieter, but they make it silent. If they were
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:45.280]  able to, and the TDP would allow for it, they could make a larger tower that is truly fanless.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.760]  Zero noise. It doesn't make any noise because there's nothing spinning. There's no moving
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:57.920]  parts at all. I could see that maybe being a pitch for, oh, look at us use this in recording studios
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.080]  and in server environments where noise is, you know, we care about that. But that also
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.400]  doesn't really seem like a pitch for a much more expensive larger computer that is effectively from
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:16.720]  a performance standpoint the same as what we already have. So I think the rumors have to be
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:24.160]  wrong because it just does not make sense. What I could see happening is that Apple wanted the M1
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:28.240]  Extreme or whatever they were going to call it, the Jade 4C to happen. They couldn't make it
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:35.040]  happen. And they said, okay, we've got to operate within the limitations of the Jade 2C that we've
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:41.520]  got within the M1 Ultra. But what else can we do to make this more performant? And I think there's
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:50.080]  two options. One is support standard off the shelf AMD GPUs. They're already doing it on the Intel
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:56.080]  Mac Pro, and they'd have to write all of the driver firmware and work with AMD to make that
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.920]  happen. But in theory, they could release a computer that fixes Apple Silicon's biggest
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:07.680]  limitation. And that's graphical performance. Option number two, which I can see them doing
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.520]  is, and this would be wild, but maybe, I don't know, is they'll never say this on stage,
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.360]  but they basically say something to the effect of, hey, so we couldn't glue these all together and
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.160]  put it in a single chip, but here you can buy the M1 Ultra and then you can buy accelerator.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.880]  You can put in another M1 Ultra, you can put in another M1 Max, and these are specialized
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.440]  sockets. And yeah, these, you can only buy them for us, but it's because it's a unique
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:37.760]  kind of device. And there will be limitations that come from doing that. One of the benefits
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.160]  and argument for Apple Silicon, putting everything in the same package is that everything's super
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:47.920]  close to each other. You don't have to deal with travel distances and memory sinking issues. It's
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.640]  just all right there. Maybe they can detune a couple of chips and then say, yeah, well,
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.720]  it's not as good as putting it under the same package. But if you need that extra headroom,
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:02.480]  you can sock it in a few extra M series chips into the machine to give yourself more compute
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:08.000]  or more GPU. Those are the only two scenarios in which I can see a Mac Pro existing that's
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.640]  different from what we would expect a Mac Pro to be, which is a larger, hotter, faster chip than
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:21.200]  what we've already seen. Because otherwise, why? Right. And that's where I am. I'm exactly aligned
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:27.520]  with you where I have no little birdies telling me anything about this. I kind of feel like
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:40.640]  experience says that because the Mac Pro is such a many orders of magnitude, lower unit sale device,
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:49.840]  it is a niche that Apple can therefore keep it secret and has in the past. When the current Mac
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.240]  Pro, the Intel one you can buy, nobody knew what it looked like before it came out.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:59.600]  And they can do that. Well, they announced it long before it released, right? So maybe
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.720]  the same scenario. Well, I think that might be true too, right? So if Gurman's like,
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:09.360]  hey, I don't even think they're going to talk about the Mac Pro at WWDC. That might be based
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.320]  on there's no supply chain ramp up right now to build it. But I think that for the same reason
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.480]  that they announced it, and I think like five, six months, like they said later this year,
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.840]  which often for Apple means the very end of the year. Get ready to do your review around December
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.200]  4th, right? But I could see that's what I think. But I think they have to show it if they've got
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:44.240]  a plan. And I just... Something like that where don't get... I think we shouldn't... And again,
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:48.480]  this isn't based on sources. This is my own speculation, but it's the only way it makes sense
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:54.800]  is that there's a very different Silicon story for the Mac Pro compared to everything else,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:02.080]  which is that everything isn't on one SOC, right? That's all the whole Apple Silicon
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.040]  story from that when they started making those chips for the phones
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  15 years ago has been... There's a system on a chip and that everything is there. And
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:20.640]  in... Before the M1 came out, integrated memory was a dirty word, right? The integrated memory
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.440]  meant it's a low cost device or a low power device with poor graphical performance.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.960]  Whereas with Apple Silicon, the shared memory, the fact that the GPU and the CPUs share the
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:38.080]  same memory is a huge performance win. But it also means though you can't... Like if you're
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:44.480]  Mac Pro use case is your aerospace engineer, there's a guy named Craig, I forget his last
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:50.560]  name, but he often reviews the new high-end Pro hardware. And he's the type of person who's doing
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:57.200]  CAD design for the wing of an airplane and running these extremely computationally expensive
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:05.600]  simulations to test an airplane design. That use case might be, I don't really need more CPU or GPU
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:14.720]  what I need is as much RAM as possible. I just wanna stick and I wanna spend $25,000 on RAM
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:21.360]  to stick in here. Everything is on a system on a chip design doesn't scale to that because
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:30.400]  where we are with the Mac studio, the highest performance Mac is the M1 Ultra in the Mac studio
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  where you keep adding GPUs and CPUs and neural engines and RAM, even if you only need the RAM
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.720]  or super common use case in today's world, perhaps the common use case of high-end,
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:53.760]  no budget, just throw as much money as you'll take from us at this is GPU performance, right?
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.160]  Again, I don't think Apple's going to do that and support AMD graphic cards just because
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:08.560]  culturally, I think Apple is against it. I don't think they like AMD. I think there have been
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.880]  reports for, I don't know, close to 20 years now that they just do not get along with their
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.720]  engineers. The driver support's always been a weird thing. I don't think they're gonna do it.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.960]  But if they did, you're like, hey, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:29.200]  You're like, hey, here's scenario one. It would be a crowd pleaser, right? Like the developers
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.360]  on the lawn out there and the live stream of the video on keynote day,
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.800]  they're gonna applaud for that because there's a lot of people who'd like to see that happen.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:45.200]  But I don't think it is. I think it's more likely that they've got this entirely
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:59.680]  up until now secret project to have for pros a way to modularly upgrade what you need,
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.680]  whether it's graphics or RAM or graphics and RAM or whatever.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.480]  I think and hope that's the case too, because if you look at who purchased the 2019 Mac Pro,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.160]  who are the pros to Apple? The overwhelming majority of people that I think were purchasing
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:24.080]  that machine were developers. And the Mac studio mostly resolves that problem that most developers
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.600]  had. So that narrows the already narrow market even further, right? One of the other reasons
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:35.040]  that people were critical of the cost of the Mac Pro when it came out, the 2019 one, was that it
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:41.760]  had eight full size PCI slots. That's very unusual. Most PC motherboards will have six,
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:47.760]  maybe seven, but only two or three of those are full size. Apple had eight. It was really weird.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:54.960]  But one of the reasons and they never referenced this publicly, but one of the major markets that
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:01.760]  uses a bunch of PCI add on cards is musicians and people in music because they have accelerators and
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:07.520]  there's a bunch of cards that are utilized by specific audio engineering software that's designed
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:14.080]  to work with cards. Now, many of them by force and by necessity have moved to Thunderbolt because
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:21.840]  Apple just didn't make a PCIe based Mac for years, right? From 2013 to 2019, they didn't have one.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.440]  So a lot of stuff started moving over, but much of it didn't. And the other kind of cascading
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:33.840]  effect of that is there's several DAWs, audio workstation apps designed for audio engineering,
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.560]  they kind of became abandoned while on the Mac because there was nowhere to do that. And then
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:45.040]  the 2019 Mac Pro came out and they were re-revived and now they're kind of focusing where possible
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.720]  on Apple Silicon. And so maybe potentially if there's nothing special about this new computer,
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:55.920]  it could be, okay, yeah, this is for people that need PC expansion, not graphics, but other things.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:02.720]  Not graphics, but other stuff. But that's a really narrow market. And so then the last people that
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:07.680]  are kind of left over are, yeah, the people that need all of that GPU compute and where this gets
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:13.680]  even more complicated, as I've talked in my research to a couple of people that are innately
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:21.200]  familiar with working on a Mac. And there's someone that I've worked at, they're a 3D graphics
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:26.720]  engineer. And then there's another developer downtown that does, they do game development
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.680]  and they're doing 3D model and asset creation on Macs because they like a Mac.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:38.000]  In both of those instances, one of them was still using pre, was it macOS Catalina?
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.080]  Pre Catalina machines, because those were the last machines that supported Nvidia graphics drivers.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:44.580]  Right.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.160]  So actually it might've been High Sierra, old, like four or five years old. And they were using
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.840]  old GPUs, but they're like, yeah, we just, Nvidia cards work better on the software we're using,
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.280]  and we don't want to move over to AMD cards. The other people had moved over to AMD cards
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:08.800]  on 2019 Mac pros, and then in some instances on eGPUs, but they said that we want to move to Apple
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:14.720]  Silicon, but the applications that we use are not even planning to move stuff over just because
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.360]  there's not the headroom that they need to be able to do all of this stuff graphically.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:24.240]  There's not enough compute. And so they're like, we're in this awkward no man's land where even
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:28.480]  if a machine does come out with this capability, it's going to take a couple of years probably
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.160]  to port these apps reliably over to Apple Silicon. We can't wait that long. We're already at the last
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:40.240]  thread and we might have to move. We might be forced to move to PCs until that can become a
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:45.760]  thing because Apple already took too long to do what we wanted them to do. And so they're in this
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.360]  really tough spot. And I agree that they can't just come out and say, here you go. It's what
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.800]  you've had, but bigger. There's got to be something that we're not understanding because otherwise,
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:03.040]  why do it at all? Yeah. So my bet would be that we're going to get a new Mac studio,
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.800]  and then they're going to say, and something, something, John Ternus, something, something,
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.440]  the Mac studio has been a terrific hit. Our developers love it. And here's, they'll have
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.760]  three different use cases and show these professionals doing it. And then they'll say,
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:24.960]  but, and they'll act like it was an all new idea to maybe have a Mac pro. Right. And they'll act
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.800]  like this is a genius idea. We're going to have a Mac pro for people who the Mac studio isn't even
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.320]  as great as it is. They need more. Right. And I think we're going to get it. And I think there
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.200]  will be some sort of expansion story. And I know that here too, for Mac Silicon or Apple Silicon,
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:51.760]  hasn't had any expansion story at all, other than Thunderbolt, but I just, just to wrap a bow on it,
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:30:02.240]  I don't think that Apple's late year Intel designs were of a different mindset than what they,
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.760]  they have now. Right. It's, it is a, it's a technical schism where it's an entirely
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.880]  different instruction set. The machines have entirely different performance to what
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:19.360]  characteristics, but philosophically, I don't think Apple shifted. I mentioned the Mac pro
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.440]  iMac pro, right. Which was a weird one off computer. There was only one iMac pro.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.800]  Did you have one? It seemed like it might be something that you would have. Yeah. You would
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:34.560]  have been right up your alley, but like I said, they, they were so proud of the thermal
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:41.040]  characteristics of the iMac pro and that philosophy clearly carries through to Apple Silicon.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:51.040]  Right. They late the last five years of Intel max were so much about modularity. They, they
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:58.240]  emphasize the word modular, modular, modular. So I really do think that will be the key to the Mac,
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:05.200]  the Mac pro with Apple Silicon is some sort of modular design. Now, if the graphic story
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:12.720]  is you can expand the graphics, but they're Apple graphics, that's going to be really interesting
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:17.360]  whether the industry supports it with their software. Like you said, with these,
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:23.920]  these pros, you know, who, who are literally sticking with years old versions of the, the OS
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:28.720]  so that they can use Nvidia graphics because that's what the software supports. So will the
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:35.840]  software industry embrace this? It's surely Apple's will right. Final cut and logic are going to take
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:41.200]  advantage of these. And if I'm right, that you can expand the Ram and the graphics without
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:50.080]  adding entire systems on a chip to the thing. I it's an open question, right? I mean, I don't
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:54.640]  know. I don't know, but I, that's where I think they're going. It will be interesting indeed.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.800]  Although I, I, my prediction is that they do come out with a Mac pro this year,
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.200]  but that they don't update the Mac studio. I think it'll become a every other generation
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:08.400]  type thing. Cause the market's so small that having successive releases, I think just probably
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.160]  doesn't make sense, especially from a binning standpoint. I think just the quantity of chips
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:17.360]  that will be able to do what Apple needs them to be is not that high. And so they'll just,
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.960]  yeah. Oh yeah. And the dev that wants a Mac studio two years and look how much faster.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.880]  That's the other thing they'll be able to do that they love to do is say it's 25%
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.680]  faster than the previous Mac studio. Right. So I could, that would be my second guess would be,
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:38.240]  there is no new empty that there is no M two series max studio, but they'll keep the max
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.320]  studio. I don't think the max studio is going anywhere. No, that's not a one-off that's a,
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:46.560]  that's a computer here to stay, but they'll just, but then they can breeze past it in the
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.560]  keynote and say, it's been a big hit. It's got these great performance characteristics,
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.360]  but now here's the Mac pro and it's so much faster in every way. Right. Knock on wood.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:59.120]  I really, I really do think that that's what we're going to see. All right. Let me take one
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.760]  last break here and thank our third and final sponsor of this episode. Our good friends at
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:12.240]  collide. That's K O L I D E. They have big news. If you're an Okta user, they can get your entire
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:20.240]  fleet of devices to 100% compliance. How if a device in your company, somebody's laptop isn't
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:25.600]  compliant, they can't log into your cloud apps until they've fixed the problem that has their
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:32.080]  machine out of compliance. It's that simple. They patch one of the major holes in zero trust
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:38.960]  architecture. That's device compliance without collide. It struggles to solve basic problems,
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.600]  like keeping everyone's operating system and their browser up to date with the latest software
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.560]  updates. Insecure devices are logging into your company's apps because there's nothing there to
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.800]  stop them. Collide is the only device trust solution that enforces compliance as part
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.960]  of authentication. And it's built to work seamlessly with Okta. The moment collides
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.920]  agent detects a problem, it alerts the user, gives them simple instructions, how to fix it.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:10.000]  And if they don't fix it within a set time, they're blocked from logging in. It's that
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.240]  simple. Collides method means fewer support tickets, less frustration, and most importantly,
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:24.240]  100% fleet compliance. Visit collide.com slash the talk show to learn more or book a demo.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.880]  That's K O L I D E collide.com slash the talk show.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:37.680]  So if we want to go afield here and stop talking about Apple for the last segment of the show,
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:46.720]  I wrote a little bit about Humain's demo of their, to me, slightly unusual demo that founder
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:53.920]  Imran Shoudary did at TED over the weekend last week. As far as I know, as you and I record,
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.480]  the TED video is still not available, even though there was some speculation it was going to come
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:08.000]  out on Monday. It didn't. There's like Ray Wong at inverse collected as much information that
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.800]  came out on Twitter. So there there's enough to get a sense of the demo, but not the product.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:18.560]  I'm curious your thoughts. What did you think? Be honest.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:24.800]  I thought it was a great demo. Nothing that they showed made me think, wow,
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:31.600]  I I'm going to ditch my smartphone for that. The idea of having a conversation with your
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:37.520]  shirt is not appealing to me in any way whatsoever when you could just do it quietly on a phone. Now,
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:45.360]  I do think that they're. Them tapping into AI and machine learning based stuff is,
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:52.800]  is pretty clever, but I'm not confident that they're going to be the ones to pull it off.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.840]  If that makes sense. I mean, they can make the hardware, but ultimately they're going to be
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:03.040]  using presumably chat GPT or someone else's engine to do all of the kind of natural language
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:07.600]  processing. And then at that point, they're effectively a hardware device that, you know,
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:12.800]  and then some of the stuff like the projector, like that's just gimmicky. It looks like a
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:18.800]  monochrome display. Someone sent me a message on Mastodon that made me laugh that said,
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.360]  wow, who would have figured that a hand was a worse screen than a screen. And it's just like,
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:30.960]  why? I mean, it's a very great demo, but it reminds me of like early 2000 slash early 2010s,
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:35.520]  like magic leap S kind of like, this is the future before anyone stops to think,
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.640]  but do we actually want that? I don't. There's the famous I think he said it,
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:47.600]  or he's attributed to him multiple times, Steve jobs saying that such and such is
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.960]  that's not a product that's technology. I know supposedly he said that to the Dropbox founders
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:37:02.160]  at some point in some alternate universe. Maybe I, you know, it's what's Apple's standard PR line
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.160]  when they acquire a company. And usually they acquire companies and they don't even want
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.880]  anybody to know, but if it does leak, they say Apple, Apple acquire smaller companies
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.480]  from time to time. And our policy is generally not to talk about why.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.600]  And that's not verbatim what they say, but whatever it is, it's like a copy and paste.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.360]  They have like a text expander snippet to send that out. There's some universe where Apple
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:33.520]  bought Dropbox, but obviously they didn't in hindsight. And at the end of his life,
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:40.400]  the last few keynotes Steve jobs did, I think it's, I have always thought that he repeated it,
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:48.880]  that sort of Apple exists at the intersection of the liberal arts and technology. And not to be too
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.280]  morbid, but time has passed and the book came out, which is wonderful, literally wonderful,
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:59.520]  make something wonderful. It's a little less sad to talk about, but I feel like it was his
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.320]  parting message to the world. And that's why he ended a couple of keynotes with it. But it does
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:11.200]  come down to the same idea that technology is not enough. You don't start with technology and then
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:17.040]  package it as a product. You have to start with a vision for the product and then figure out,
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:24.000]  oh, but we can't, this is our idea for how a phone would work, but we don't have a screen that does
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.560]  touch with zero latency. Well, let's make it right. We have this vision for a truly immersive
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.640]  headset, but if it's going to be immersive, we need graphics to do this. We need screens that
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.200]  don't exist. We need integrated sound to do spatial audio. There's a vision for this is what
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.640]  the experience is going to be like. I kind of feel, and again, I'm fascinated by Humain and I
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.040]  know that a lot of what I've written about them is snarky. When it made fun of the video, they
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:59.600]  came out with a couple of months ago, just because I don't want to see a video for the
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.760]  phone. They had a merch drop a week or two ago where they're selling sweatshirts and it's like,
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:13.840]  I want to see the product. But I'm not down. I would love it if they blow me away.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:28.720]  It's a very strange thing that post iPhone, there's very few stories about, here's these
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:36.160]  people who left Apple and made a new company or a new product. Tony Fidel is the biggest
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.200]  counter example I can think of where he founded Nest. I've got Nest thermostats here in the house
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:50.640]  and I like them, but they're thermostats. I've talked to Tony Fidel. He's a fascinating person
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:40:00.160]  and I wouldn't be surprised if he's got more products in him. He seems like a serial creator
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:08.240]  and he has an itch to make things, but where are the companies that have X Apple people who are
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:13.920]  making cool things? I know there's some X Apple people at Airbnb. I know that there are X Apple
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:21.680]  people at other companies, but again, nobody's made, I don't know, back in the 1.0 era of Apple,
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.560]  people who left Apple went on to found General Magic. And again, General Magic wasn't a hit
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:34.560]  product, but it presaged the handheld communicator idea. They just were ahead of their time.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:42.720]  And so Humane's story where the founders were X Apple and they've hired tons of X Apple people,
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.840]  I don't know how many people work at Humane and what percentage of them formerly worked at Apple,
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:55.520]  but it's a lot. And that to me says, interesting. But then I see this TED demo and I'm like,
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:05.280]  Yeah. And that's the problem too. I think because of what Apple is and because of how Apple's
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.920]  culture has been so carefully developed over decades, I think that
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.400]  not that they almost did themselves a disservice because I know people there. And I think that
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.160]  at least the ones I'm aware of are very talented people, but you almost set yourself up for failure
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:27.280]  by you're going to be the company of X Apple people. And then I was just confused by the
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.840]  whole, I know part of the TED talkie stuff that came out was like, kind of a leak, but not really.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.080]  And then they kind of publicly said, Oh yeah, look, and there's a TED talk. It just seems like
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:43.520]  the weirdest way to like a TED talk to talk about a new product segment in 2023 is bizarre.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:49.120]  Yeah. I mean, I, I think they, I made a joke. I said they should have talked to Carl pay
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.880]  because at least he knows how to drive hype over nothing. I don't know. The whole rollout strategy
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:59.520]  is bizarre. And so I, I'm reserving judgment because I'm like, well, we don't really know
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.760]  what this is yet, but based on what I've seen, I've been very unimpressed, maybe.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:14.240]  Yeah. And it, and it's just strange that there's no product name. He didn't take it out of his
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:21.440]  pocket. It's it seems after watching it numerous times, you know, that it's a bigger device than
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.320]  you might think. I think, you know, that there was custom tailoring on his jacket to hide most
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:31.840]  of the device. You can see it to look like it was about the size of a knife on five. I mean,
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.640]  it's pretty big looking. Yeah. Or like one of those like battery packs you can put on the back
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:42.800]  of an iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The magic, what do they call them? The max safe, whatever the,
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:51.760]  the magnetic one. And I've maybe I'm too hyper-focused on it, but it seems like they're
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:59.760]  the ones who were all in on the, you don't need your phone anymore. And like I, I quote tweeted
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.160]  Imran's tweet where, where he thought we deserve better when he had the comparison of the fans at
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.880]  the Lakers game where thousands of fans had their phones out in front of them so they could record
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:16.880]  the video. I don't see how this device gets past that. So even if it has an always on camera,
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:23.840]  which in itself is a problem. It's concerning. Right. Like I know we're a decade past Google
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:29.040]  Glass, but you know, it, it, people aren't comfortable with that and it's a battery issue
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.480]  and it's a privacy issue. But if you've got this thing on your chest, like a Star Trek communicator
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:42.320]  and you're at the Lakers game, you're not going to get a usable photo. Even if it hypothetically,
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:48.400]  if it's like, Hey, it's streams, it shoots video all day long and you've got your whole life.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:53.520]  And you can just say, Hey, what happened at four 20 PM and go back and look at the video.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.200]  You're not going to get a good image from your chest perspective when you're at the,
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.360]  if you want a photo from your seat at the Lakers game, you've got to hold a camera
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:07.120]  in front of you. There's no way around it. Yep. Your, your hand is seemingly a bad display.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.320]  Like it's just very strange to me. And, and the demo he got, the AI voice said to him,
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:19.280]  you've got one new email and Bethany sent you two photos. And I thought, well, that's a very
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:26.320]  strange message to demo. She sent you two photos. Well, literally if you don't have a display,
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:33.360]  how can you see the photos? Like if you've got a voicemail from Bethany, well then you could say,
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:38.080]  Whoa, play the voicemail. Or even if it's a text message, you could say, read, you know, as our
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:42.480]  internet communicators do now, they can read your text messages while you're out and about
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.400]  a photo. They can't really do much with what, what are they going to do?
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.760]  And there was a bunch of stuff like that, where you're like at, again, from 10,000 feet up,
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:54.640]  you're like, well, that's kind of cool. But then you think about it and you go,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:59.520]  but why? I mean, the example of him receiving a phone call from Bethany to his wife,
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.640]  like he holds his palm up and it says, Oh, call from Bethany.
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:07.920]  But the entire time he's interacting with the device via voice and it responds. And so
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.240]  why could it not just say, Hey, Bethany's calling. Why do you need to hold your hand up and go,
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:18.160]  Oh yes, Bethany. And then I don't know how you act on that. The demo they used of translation
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.960]  was one of those other ones where at first you're like, well, that's pretty cool. And then you think
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:29.680]  about it and go, well, wait a minute. Because in the demo, he, he pushes the button. He holds this
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.680]  button down on the device that it appears you need to hold it down for it to record your audio,
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.720]  or at least for you to prompt it. So he holds down this button and says a sentence and then let's go.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:45.520]  And the thing speaks back in French. And he says, that was my voice that has been stitched together
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:51.760]  speaking fluent French, but you're like, hold, hold on. Because at no point did he say translate
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:58.720]  this translated to French. It's clearly, I mean, I think Nilay Patel made the joke on the verge
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.280]  in the comment section saying this is one of the world's easiest demos to fake. It could just be
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:11.840]  an MP3 player. It's just kind of true where I understand the, the ideology of thinking
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.520]  that smartphones are endemic to society and they're ruining the way we interact with people.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.960]  And that may well be true, but part of the reason that they are so prevalent is because they're so
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:30.080]  useful. And so if you're planning on replacing it, you better bring something good. And I just
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:36.240]  don't know if anyone can pull that off much less what we've seen demonstrated, but you can't help
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:40.480]  be curious just because of who's made it up. And that's the other thing too, is if it were any
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.960]  other company, people would probably be like, oh, that's ridiculous. Like if a Chinese company came
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.440]  out with it, it wouldn't even get an article, but because it's a bunch of Apple people, we're all
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:57.440]  talking about it. So, yeah. And I get the one, again, go up to the 10,000 foot view overview,
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:06.880]  the idea of an AI first computing platform, it resonates with me that we're at this moment where
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:15.360]  AI is becoming real and breakthroughs have happened in literally in the last year.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.040]  Yeah, in months.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:24.960]  And we're doing it all on computers, computing devices, the cloud where this computation is
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:30.960]  happening to how we're consuming it and chatting and prompting the mid journey and whatever else
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.160]  we're doing. We're doing it on these computers that were designed before AI. Somebody is going
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.000]  to come up with an AI first computer. We don't know what it looks like. And it's like all of
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.480]  these breakthroughs in history had nobody knows what are we going to do. The iPod was effectively,
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:55.600]  the origin story was John Rubenstein was in Japan or somewhere in Asia.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:01.440]  And Toshiba had these small hard drives and they said, we've had like a breakthrough in how small
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:05.440]  we can make a hard drive. We don't know what to do with it though because they're more expensive
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:11.520]  because they're so small and laptop makers don't need them to be that small. And he comes back and
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.720]  says, what can we do with this amazing technology? And they come up with it. The bitmap display was
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.000]  where we got graphical user interface computing from. Nobody knew how that was going to look.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.120]  Somebody is going to come up with AI first devices, whether we call them computers or not,
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:33.280]  I don't know. But I just don't see a badge on my chest being it, right?
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:40.240]  Yeah. Maybe this is the MP man from 1997 that proceeded the iPod. I don't know.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:47.520]  And you mentioned earlier too, that having voice be the primary interface to it is
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.440]  more conspicuous, right? Like if you're out and if you're in your car by yourself,
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:59.360]  well then so what? But like when you're at the grocery store or you're on the sidewalk or you're
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:06.960]  at any of the a hundred at work anywhere, if you're always talking to it, it's weird, right?
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.400]  And you feel self-conscious about it. And you might be doing things you don't want other people
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:18.720]  to overhear, right? And if you have to speak it, I don't know. I'm just left scratching my head.
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.440]  I am too. I do think that it has the potential to normalize itself. I mean, I remember
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.120]  how hard AirPods were to get when they first came out. I got them the week they released
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.720]  and for months they just weren't available. And I remember wearing them around my university
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.800]  campus thinking I look like an idiot. And people would look over at me and they weren't like,
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:43.440]  oh, those are the cool new AirPods. They'd look at me like, what are those? And I saw
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.600]  one or two other people on campus that had them too. And I said, they look truly stupid.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.920]  And now we don't give a second thought to it, right? Because they're ubiquitous and they're
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:57.440]  great. And so maybe this becomes that, but talking in public is a much greater barrier than
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:03.360]  something you might wear. So I can see the idea of wearing a weird little futuristic gadget thing
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.080]  on your shirt, but having conversations in public with it, I don't know about that.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.480]  Well, and the thing I don't get about it is not having it be another satellite to your phone,
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:20.080]  right? And to me, to me, a lot of the stuff they're talking about at Humane with their thing
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.560]  again, which is, it's really weird that they demoed it and still didn't give it a name,
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:29.360]  but okay. They're unnamed Humane device. To me, a lot of the stuff they're talking about
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.760]  are things that we do with our Apple watches, right?
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:38.480]  Yeah. There's nothing that, yeah. And if Apple wanted to get more AI heavy on the watch,
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:45.280]  they could. Right. Like you can, I do it. I I'll sign off from my phone and leave my phone
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:52.000]  in the kitchen charging or something and sit down and watch TV with my wife. And, but I've got my
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.320]  Apple watch on. So if I do get an important text message, I can glance at my wrist and see it.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:02.000]  It just seems sort of like the watch solves the problem of having a small, less obtrusive,
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.960]  you're not staring at your phone all day device, but it works in conjunction with your phone.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.200]  So you don't want to stare at your hand. Come on, John.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.920]  Anything else? I guess that's, we could call it a show. I will thank our sponsors, our good
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.120]  friends. Let's see if I could do it off the top of my head. I suffer from podcast amnesia. We had
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:27.360]  collide KOL IDE, where you can get your fleet into compliance, trade coffee. That's trade. Let's see.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:34.320]  I don't remember the URL though. Trade coffee.com slash believe the talk show. That's where you can
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:40.880]  subscribe to get us a coffee subscription. And last but not least our good friends at back blaze.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:48.400]  Here I am cheating, looking at my notes online backup for your Mac or PC for seven bucks a month,
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:57.520]  go to back blaze.com slash daring fireball. And your channel Quinn is over at youtube.com
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:05.280]  your channel. Quinn is over at youtube.com slash snazzy, right? Yep. That's correct.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.640]  That's your channel on YouTube with your excellent, excellent videos that I'm a fan of.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:13.280]  And the people can find you on the mastadon. I just, I don't even give out my username,
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:18.000]  just search for a Quinn Nelson, right? Yeah. That's probably the easiest way to find me.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.680]  Yeah. I don't the whole at, at whatever the domain is too much. Yeah. But it works out.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:31.760]  I always come, I remember it must be 15 years ago, Jason freed at 37 signals observed that,
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:38.560]  Hey, we were going to buy, spend a fortune on a domain name. I think it was like backpack was
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:43.040]  their product and they couldn't get backpack.com and they were like, Oh, we were going to, and he
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:48.080]  was like, you know what? Nobody even uses, they just Google for backpack and know if it's backpack,
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.880]  I think it was like backpack.it.com was what they wound up with. And it was like, yeah,
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:57.600]  it doesn't matter. People just search. So search for Quinn Nelson Quinn. Thank you for your time.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:24.240]  Really? I'm so happy to have had you on the show. Well, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.
