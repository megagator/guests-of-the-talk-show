[00:00.000 --> 00:02.740]  Did you hear something just go ping?
[00:02.740 --> 00:03.580]  No.
[00:03.580 --> 00:04.400]  Good.
[00:04.400 --> 00:05.240]  All right.
[00:05.240 --> 00:08.980]  How's the new setup working?
[00:10.220 --> 00:11.060]  It's great.
[00:11.060 --> 00:12.560]  It comes with all these dials.
[00:14.220 --> 00:15.980]  See, that's my old setup.
[00:15.980 --> 00:19.660]  My old setup was just a mic and then add a USB
[00:19.660 --> 00:22.260]  and the USB goes in your computer and that is it.
[00:22.260 --> 00:23.540]  There's nothing else.
[00:26.660 --> 00:29.580]  Oh, do you have like a preamp?
[00:29.580 --> 00:31.260]  Yeah, this one has,
[00:34.220 --> 00:35.260]  here's the box right here.
[00:35.260 --> 00:40.260]  It's an Onyx blackjack premium two by two USB
[00:40.640 --> 00:43.100]  recording interface from Mackie.
[00:44.020 --> 00:46.920]  And it's got a bunch of these dials and stuff.
[00:46.920 --> 00:48.000]  Looks serious.
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.740]  I mean, it makes me feel very professional.
[00:49.740 --> 00:51.100]  It's a very nice piece of equipment
[00:51.100 --> 00:53.500]  but now I've got all these dials to turn.
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.700]  Marco told me how to set it up.
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.400]  He just sent me a picture and just said,
[00:57.400 --> 00:59.360]  just turn all the dials like this.
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.540]  Yeah, so I did that.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.320]  All right.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.280]  Man, that thing, wow.
[01:06.780 --> 01:07.620]  Really?
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.740]  You have the one that's on Amazon?
[01:09.740 --> 01:10.980]  Yeah.
[01:10.980 --> 01:11.820]  How many dials?
[01:11.820 --> 01:14.140]  Well, this one's six, like all of them.
[01:14.140 --> 01:15.820]  This one has all of them.
[01:15.820 --> 01:17.040]  No, this one is.
[01:18.300 --> 01:20.340]  The one I'm looking at has like 120 dials.
[01:20.340 --> 01:21.160]  No, no, no.
[01:21.160 --> 01:23.660]  This one has five dials, two inputs,
[01:23.660 --> 01:25.600]  something for the monitor and then.
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.600]  Okay, this looks like one of your bad interfaces of the day.
[01:33.460 --> 01:34.660]  Or the week or whatever.
[01:36.160 --> 01:38.700]  It looks like an Access database gone wrong.
[01:39.860 --> 01:42.300]  Are you sending it by Skype or are you sending it?
[01:43.840 --> 01:45.000]  Oh, I see it, I see it.
[01:48.140 --> 01:48.980]  Oh my God.
[01:50.320 --> 01:51.160]  Oh my God.
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.000]  If that had shown up, if I had just done what Marco said
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.660]  and this had shown up at my door, I would have just.
[02:00.140 --> 02:01.500]  It would have been very cinematic.
[02:01.500 --> 02:02.420]  It would have been one of those things
[02:02.420 --> 02:03.260]  where I would have opened,
[02:03.260 --> 02:05.580]  you know, you open the cardboard box from Amazon
[02:05.580 --> 02:07.540]  and then I would have seen this
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.460]  and then I would have just set the box down
[02:09.460 --> 02:11.820]  and I would have gotten my keys.
[02:11.820 --> 02:13.140]  Walked into the ocean.
[02:14.020 --> 02:16.420]  Just started driving.
[02:16.420 --> 02:18.660]  Just drive right to the Atlantic Coast.
[02:18.660 --> 02:22.260]  Okay, so you have the Onyx Blackjack two by two.
[02:22.260 --> 02:23.420]  Yeah.
[02:23.420 --> 02:26.740]  Oh God, if I got this, I'd just kill myself.
[02:26.740 --> 02:28.100]  That's more manageable.
[02:28.100 --> 02:28.940]  You know what though?
[02:28.940 --> 02:31.900]  To me, it looks like it might as well be this.
[02:34.100 --> 02:36.500]  Well, it's five more dials than you're used to having.
[02:37.660 --> 02:39.340]  It's five more dials than I can handle.
[02:39.340 --> 02:43.180]  It's five times as complicated as what you were using before.
[02:43.180 --> 02:47.140]  I don't know if it's because I'm getting older.
[02:48.340 --> 02:50.060]  I think maybe it's a little bit of column A,
[02:50.060 --> 02:51.260]  a little bit of column B.
[02:51.260 --> 02:53.620]  I don't think I've ever been very smart
[02:53.620 --> 02:55.600]  about dealing with complex interfaces.
[02:57.580 --> 03:00.020]  But you know, it's like with the Apple Music stuff,
[03:00.020 --> 03:04.100]  you know, and the iCloud photo library and stuff.
[03:04.100 --> 03:06.700]  I need it to be one dial.
[03:06.700 --> 03:09.240]  I like, you know, I like one dial.
[03:09.240 --> 03:10.460]  Right.
[03:10.460 --> 03:11.500]  So I don't know.
[03:11.500 --> 03:13.540]  But you say I sound good, so we'll take it.
[03:13.540 --> 03:14.980]  Yeah, yeah, no, I think so.
[03:14.980 --> 03:16.100]  What do I know?
[03:16.100 --> 03:18.260]  Yeah, you've got Cracker Jack ears, right?
[03:18.260 --> 03:23.260]  Right, I am not, no, I've actually been struggling.
[03:25.300 --> 03:29.820]  I bought a couple of Bluetooth headphones
[03:29.820 --> 03:31.560]  when I got the Apple Watch.
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.400]  Yeah.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.980]  And I was gonna like write up a thing about it,
[03:33.980 --> 03:35.780]  but I just, I don't even feel like I can do it
[03:35.780 --> 03:37.580]  because I don't, first of all,
[03:37.580 --> 03:40.340]  neither one of them is good, so.
[03:40.340 --> 03:41.180]  Which ones did you get?
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.260]  So I don't feel like I have a recommendation.
[03:42.260 --> 03:43.880]  I got cheap ones, I got really cheap ones.
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.180]  And I feel like I, and that's the other thing
[03:45.180 --> 03:46.980]  is I feel like I should try one that's like 100 bucks
[03:46.980 --> 03:51.060]  because I got ones that were like 30, and they're terrible.
[03:51.060 --> 03:54.940]  So it's like, so far that's the only advice I have
[03:54.940 --> 03:56.820]  is don't buy ones that are 30,
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.820]  which I don't feel like is great advice.
[03:58.820 --> 04:00.180]  Yeah, I don't know if you remember,
[04:00.180 --> 04:05.060]  I would, when Joanna Stern was on a few weeks ago,
[04:05.060 --> 04:06.340]  back in April, we were talking about it.
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.080]  We both bought the same ones, these Beats ones,
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.260]  which are overpriced.
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.100]  I mean.
[04:10.100 --> 04:12.380]  Yeah, right, that's what I've heard too,
[04:12.380 --> 04:14.300]  so I didn't wanna buy those.
[04:14.300 --> 04:17.380]  But do those work okay?
[04:17.380 --> 04:18.460]  Yeah, I think so.
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.460]  Well, the thing was is that we both were complaining
[04:20.460 --> 04:22.860]  about latency, and then it was a follow-up
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.940]  a week or two later, some kind listener of the show
[04:24.940 --> 04:27.940]  was like, dude, you gotta get the firmware update.
[04:27.940 --> 04:30.240]  And I'm like, firmware update for headphones?
[04:30.240 --> 04:31.220]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[04:31.220 --> 04:33.380]  But it was honest to God truth, you go to Beats Audio
[04:33.380 --> 04:34.940]  and you tell them you got the Beats,
[04:34.940 --> 04:38.340]  whatever they're called, Bluetooth,
[04:38.340 --> 04:40.660]  and then you get a download.
[04:40.660 --> 04:43.340]  And once I got the download and installed it,
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.660]  it really did, I wouldn't say it fixed the latency
[04:45.660 --> 04:48.900]  because I'm still, you know, I'm used to the zero latency
[04:48.900 --> 04:49.940]  of a wired headphone.
[04:49.940 --> 04:50.780]  Right.
[04:50.780 --> 04:54.300]  But it's, the latency after installing the software update
[04:54.300 --> 04:57.500]  on these Beats was like what you would expect
[04:57.500 --> 05:00.060]  from Bluetooth headphones, you know?
[05:00.060 --> 05:01.780]  There's like a fraction of a second latency,
[05:01.780 --> 05:03.700]  but it's reasonable.
[05:03.700 --> 05:04.540]  Yeah.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.220]  Well, one of these was skipping,
[05:09.300 --> 05:10.940]  and the other one, the other one was,
[05:10.940 --> 05:14.220]  and I wanted them for running, and the other one was rattling.
[05:14.220 --> 05:15.060]  So.
[05:16.860 --> 05:20.460]  Well, I do think, Marco tweeted the other day,
[05:20.460 --> 05:24.620]  asked if anybody running iOS 9 Beta is experiencing
[05:25.500 --> 05:29.540]  like some skips and fallouts with Bluetooth headphones.
[05:29.540 --> 05:31.340]  And I hadn't really thought about it,
[05:31.340 --> 05:33.640]  but I think I was, I think I am.
[05:33.640 --> 05:37.300]  And so it's like the beauty of you switching
[05:37.300 --> 05:40.740]  to Bluetooth headphones is that now you're susceptible
[05:40.740 --> 05:43.180]  to software bugs and regressions.
[05:43.180 --> 05:44.020]  Right.
[05:44.020 --> 05:45.820]  Like we've taken this, we've taken this.
[05:45.820 --> 05:46.980]  It's more complicated.
[05:46.980 --> 05:49.220]  We've taken this thing that worked perfectly
[05:49.220 --> 05:52.380]  since before we were born, right?
[05:52.380 --> 05:55.460]  Like 1970, whatever, when we were born,
[05:55.460 --> 05:58.380]  or you know, for you, 68, whatever the hell it is,
[05:58.380 --> 06:00.140]  you know, there were headphones, you plugged them in,
[06:00.140 --> 06:02.000]  and then you hear what you're supposed to hear,
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.180]  and it works.
[06:03.180 --> 06:04.000]  Right.
[06:04.000 --> 06:05.740]  Until you step on the headphones or something.
[06:05.740 --> 06:07.460]  And now we've replaced it with something
[06:07.460 --> 06:09.420]  that when you upgrade your operating system,
[06:09.420 --> 06:11.060]  maybe your headphones don't work so good.
[06:11.060 --> 06:12.460]  You need a firmware upgrade.
[06:12.460 --> 06:14.220]  Right, you need a firmware update.
[06:16.060 --> 06:18.600]  Yeah, you must have had speakers
[06:18.600 --> 06:19.960]  with that big jack, right?
[06:22.040 --> 06:22.880]  Yeah.
[06:22.880 --> 06:23.700]  Headphones, I mean.
[06:23.700 --> 06:25.780]  No, well, now I have a new pair that I'm wearing
[06:25.780 --> 06:28.780]  as we speak right now because...
[06:28.780 --> 06:30.500]  Oh, they probably, yeah, this thing
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.660]  has that big jack, doesn't it?
[06:31.660 --> 06:35.020]  Yeah, and so Marco said, Marco told me I had it,
[06:35.020 --> 06:36.700]  you know, he was like, you have an adapter for that.
[06:36.700 --> 06:38.260]  And I'm like, well, I'm sure I do,
[06:38.260 --> 06:40.820]  but God, you know, who the hell knows where it is?
[06:40.820 --> 06:42.620]  And he goes, well, then you should get new headphones too.
[06:42.620 --> 06:45.180]  So now I'm wearing a pair of Marco-approved headphones
[06:45.180 --> 06:46.000]  as well.
[06:48.540 --> 06:49.940]  Well, thanks to cleaning out my basement,
[06:49.940 --> 06:51.940]  I know exactly where my adapter is.
[06:53.300 --> 06:54.140]  Really?
[06:54.140 --> 06:55.500]  You organized that stuff.
[06:55.500 --> 06:56.420]  I saw it, yeah.
[06:56.420 --> 06:58.180]  It's one of those big coiled, you know,
[06:58.180 --> 07:02.500]  it's a long cable, and it's one of those springy cables too.
[07:02.500 --> 07:04.700]  So like, I could walk around.
[07:04.700 --> 07:06.660]  Because, you know, back in the day,
[07:06.660 --> 07:08.580]  you wanted to listen to music and walk around the room
[07:08.580 --> 07:11.380]  and do stuff, and boy, could I do that.
[07:11.380 --> 07:13.900]  That was Bluetooth headphones back then.
[07:13.900 --> 07:15.820]  It was a really, really long cable.
[07:17.340 --> 07:19.980]  Because you couldn't move your stereo,
[07:19.980 --> 07:21.740]  but you still needed to move around.
[07:21.740 --> 07:24.340]  And it wasn't like you could put it in your pocket.
[07:24.340 --> 07:25.180]  I mean, that was the, you know,
[07:25.180 --> 07:28.180]  I probably had that, I probably got that thing before,
[07:28.180 --> 07:30.900]  you know, I probably had headphones for that kind of jack
[07:30.900 --> 07:33.700]  before there was, before the Walkman came out.
[07:33.700 --> 07:35.980]  Yeah, yeah, nice big fat headphones.
[07:35.980 --> 07:38.300]  So anyway, yeah, rather than buy a $2 adapter,
[07:38.300 --> 07:40.900]  I bought a $200 pair of headphones.
[07:40.900 --> 07:45.900]  No, but in my defense, the headphones I had been wearing
[07:48.860 --> 07:52.700]  were, they still work, and so I can't say that they're,
[07:52.700 --> 07:54.900]  you know, somewhere my depression-era grandparents
[07:54.900 --> 07:57.540]  are coming out of the grave to kill me.
[07:57.540 --> 08:02.540]  But they still work, but they date back to like,
[08:02.860 --> 08:04.540]  when I was doing the show with Dan Benjamin.
[08:04.540 --> 08:07.700]  I mean, they're pretty old, and the leather on the,
[08:07.700 --> 08:09.860]  the thing that goes over your head is all peeling off.
[08:09.860 --> 08:10.940]  I guess it's not even leather,
[08:10.940 --> 08:13.540]  it's, you know, quote, unquote, leather.
[08:13.540 --> 08:15.260]  Yeah, that happened to me.
[08:15.260 --> 08:17.660]  Right, and so like, every time I record a show now,
[08:17.660 --> 08:19.340]  or until I got these new headphones.
[08:19.340 --> 08:20.860]  Little things are falling out of your hair.
[08:20.860 --> 08:22.120]  Well, when I was done with the show,
[08:22.120 --> 08:24.260]  the first thing I would do would be like to shake my,
[08:24.260 --> 08:27.180]  shake my hair and get all the flakes of leatherette out.
[08:29.340 --> 08:32.300]  So I thought, why not splurge and get a new set of headphones?
[08:32.300 --> 08:35.500]  You're worth it, you deserve it after,
[08:35.500 --> 08:37.460]  how many years of podcasting?
[08:37.460 --> 08:40.900]  Like a year, two years.
[08:40.900 --> 08:42.980]  Oh, well, this show, right?
[08:42.980 --> 08:44.140]  This version of the show.
[08:44.140 --> 08:47.220]  No, this show is up, gotta be up to three years now, right?
[08:47.220 --> 08:48.860]  Because this is episode 127.
[08:48.860 --> 08:50.580]  Yeah, sound as bad as that, yeah.
[08:50.580 --> 08:52.760]  Yeah, three years.
[08:52.760 --> 08:53.860]  Oh my God, we're old.
[08:57.060 --> 08:57.940]  Everything's old.
[08:59.560 --> 09:00.820]  So what else is going on?
[09:00.820 --> 09:05.380]  So do you have, well, you probably talked about music
[09:05.380 --> 09:07.460]  on like 20 other podcasts by now.
[09:07.460 --> 09:08.340]  Well, you know what though?
[09:08.340 --> 09:09.300]  We should talk about it though.
[09:09.300 --> 09:13.540]  I talked about it with Dalrymple and it was the day
[09:13.540 --> 09:18.540]  that Jim posted his, well, I lost 4,700 songs.
[09:18.860 --> 09:21.540]  And then the show went into editing.
[09:22.700 --> 09:23.700]  I think we were, I don't know when we were,
[09:23.700 --> 09:25.900]  but it wasn't gonna air for like four days.
[09:25.900 --> 09:28.500]  And in the meantime, you know, he got called into Apple
[09:28.500 --> 09:31.060]  and he wrote like a follow-up and he straightened it out.
[09:31.060 --> 09:33.180]  And so, you know, it was his call, but he, you know,
[09:33.180 --> 09:35.100]  he was like, I'm gonna take some of the music stuff out
[09:35.100 --> 09:36.500]  cause it's not relevant, you know.
[09:36.500 --> 09:38.940]  It's the danger of recording a podcast
[09:38.940 --> 09:40.780]  as opposed to live broadcasting.
[09:40.780 --> 09:43.260]  I thought it was funny, but he took some of that out.
[09:43.260 --> 09:44.540]  But we could, we should definitely talk about it
[09:44.540 --> 09:46.860]  cause I don't even know what the hell he took out, but.
[09:48.060 --> 09:50.740]  I mean, have you, what's your experience been like?
[09:50.740 --> 09:52.100]  Anything like his or?
[09:52.100 --> 09:53.700]  I have hardly done anything with it.
[09:53.700 --> 09:56.220]  That's the thing is that, yeah, we were on vacation
[09:56.220 --> 09:58.700]  when it first came out and I signed up for it.
[09:58.700 --> 10:00.740]  So who knows, maybe my music is gone.
[10:00.740 --> 10:02.580]  I don't know, I haven't looked, but.
[10:02.580 --> 10:07.580]  I signed up for it, you know,
[10:08.180 --> 10:10.380]  cause it's free for a couple of months
[10:10.380 --> 10:13.420]  and I wanted to try the radio stuff out,
[10:13.420 --> 10:14.900]  which is new to me.
[10:14.900 --> 10:16.780]  I mean, I'm, you know, I'm the old guy
[10:16.780 --> 10:19.180]  who'd never tried the streaming stuff before.
[10:19.180 --> 10:21.260]  I guess I've tried Spotify,
[10:22.260 --> 10:23.980]  but it didn't really stick for me.
[10:23.980 --> 10:28.980]  And I tried the radio, but it's, I don't know.
[10:29.300 --> 10:30.540]  I haven't really done anything.
[10:30.540 --> 10:32.180]  It seems like all my music is still there,
[10:32.180 --> 10:33.820]  but I am terribly confused though,
[10:33.820 --> 10:36.500]  because I'm another one of these people
[10:36.500 --> 10:38.820]  where I do pay for iTunes match.
[10:38.820 --> 10:42.540]  I do have thousands of songs that I ripped from CDs,
[10:43.860 --> 10:46.060]  but now I've got the Apple Music.
[10:46.060 --> 10:46.900]  Right.
[10:46.900 --> 10:48.420]  What about you?
[10:48.420 --> 10:51.380]  Yeah, I mean, but I, well, I didn't count my songs
[10:51.380 --> 10:53.620]  before I joined the service.
[10:53.620 --> 10:57.660]  So I have no, I have no way of knowing
[10:57.660 --> 10:59.460]  if anything's missing or not actually,
[10:59.460 --> 11:00.900]  as far as I can tell.
[11:00.900 --> 11:02.460]  I mean, other than going back and looking
[11:02.460 --> 11:05.220]  for specific songs, which I'm not gonna do.
[11:05.220 --> 11:08.580]  So I have not, I can't say that I've experienced
[11:08.580 --> 11:12.860]  any loss of things that I brought to the table.
[11:14.060 --> 11:17.980]  And the funny thing is about Jim's post was that I had,
[11:17.980 --> 11:19.660]  I mean, I had used it and kind of liked it.
[11:19.660 --> 11:23.660]  I mean, I liked listening to the curated playlists
[11:23.660 --> 11:25.700]  and I liked listening to the radio stuff.
[11:26.980 --> 11:30.260]  And then I kind of just forgot about it a little bit.
[11:30.260 --> 11:32.060]  And, because that's kind of the way
[11:32.060 --> 11:34.740]  I've been using streaming services anyway,
[11:34.740 --> 11:39.740]  is I have these playlists that I make of music that I own
[11:39.740 --> 11:41.700]  and I usually end up listening to those.
[11:41.700 --> 11:43.220]  And then when I get bored with those,
[11:43.220 --> 11:45.420]  I will go out and do discovery
[11:45.420 --> 11:48.100]  through some streaming service, basically.
[11:48.100 --> 11:50.380]  Just say, okay, here's some songs that I like,
[11:50.380 --> 11:52.460]  play me some other stuff that's like this stuff.
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.260]  And then usually what I do is I go out
[11:54.260 --> 11:55.500]  and I buy the stuff that I like,
[11:55.500 --> 11:58.340]  just cause I'm 110 years old.
[11:58.340 --> 12:01.460]  So I had kind of like, you know,
[12:01.460 --> 12:03.540]  I had gone into that other, that phase again,
[12:03.540 --> 12:05.500]  where I was just listening to things that I owned
[12:05.500 --> 12:07.700]  and then Jim's post reminded me,
[12:07.700 --> 12:09.220]  oh yeah, Apple Music is out there.
[12:09.220 --> 12:10.540]  And I went back and I tried it again.
[12:10.540 --> 12:13.860]  And I still, I mean, I agree that the interface
[12:13.860 --> 12:14.740]  is kind of confusing.
[12:14.740 --> 12:16.900]  Like I really don't quite understand the difference
[12:16.900 --> 12:18.460]  between some of the tabs,
[12:18.460 --> 12:23.300]  but I do like it for music discovery quite a bit.
[12:23.300 --> 12:25.220]  I think the playlists are good
[12:25.220 --> 12:29.860]  and I generally find something that I want to keep
[12:30.860 --> 12:32.580]  anytime that I start listening to it
[12:32.580 --> 12:34.900]  for any extended period of time.
[12:34.900 --> 12:37.060]  And then the other thing that I'd recently just tried,
[12:37.060 --> 12:38.780]  which I hadn't tried the time before,
[12:38.780 --> 12:42.540]  was picking a song and then telling it
[12:42.540 --> 12:44.220]  to make a channel off that song,
[12:44.220 --> 12:47.580]  which I think works really well.
[12:47.580 --> 12:51.020]  So as far as for using it for music discovery,
[12:51.020 --> 12:52.660]  I really kind of like it.
[12:52.660 --> 12:54.420]  And then the other thing that I like about it
[12:54.420 --> 12:56.900]  is because I do so many playlists,
[12:56.900 --> 13:00.180]  because I manage my playlists myself,
[13:00.180 --> 13:02.900]  it will sync those through the cloud now.
[13:02.900 --> 13:04.780]  So I don't have to sync back and forth
[13:04.780 --> 13:09.780]  between my phone and the Mac where my music is on
[13:09.780 --> 13:11.580]  to get the playlist on there.
[13:11.580 --> 13:14.500]  Yeah, see, I haven't done playlists in years.
[13:14.500 --> 13:15.340]  Really?
[13:15.340 --> 13:16.940]  No, I swear.
[13:16.940 --> 13:18.740]  You just, what do you do?
[13:18.740 --> 13:21.140]  You just pick songs that you want to listen to immediately?
[13:21.140 --> 13:23.660]  Yeah, I don't know, for the most part.
[13:23.660 --> 13:25.420]  I don't really listen to a lot of music
[13:25.420 --> 13:29.220]  is the realization that I have come to.
[13:29.220 --> 13:30.660]  It's not a service for you.
[13:33.100 --> 13:34.620]  I am really looking forward to it.
[13:34.620 --> 13:38.220]  I want to get it in my car somehow.
[13:38.220 --> 13:40.020]  Yeah, that would be nice.
[13:40.020 --> 13:41.900]  I need a new car, I guess.
[13:41.900 --> 13:42.740]  Do you use that?
[13:42.740 --> 13:46.980]  Yeah, because I have my phone in my car, I have it in my car.
[13:46.980 --> 13:49.380]  Yeah, well, I can put my phone in my car,
[13:49.380 --> 13:51.780]  but I can't really hook my phone up to my car.
[13:51.780 --> 13:54.700]  OK, well, you might just need a new stereo.
[13:54.700 --> 13:57.980]  Well, yeah, but again.
[13:57.980 --> 14:00.180]  You went out and bought a $200 pair of headphones,
[14:00.180 --> 14:04.380]  but you don't necessarily have to go out and buy a new car.
[14:04.380 --> 14:08.020]  Again, it would be a lot easier to just buy a new car that
[14:08.020 --> 14:10.580]  had a lightning jack.
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.140]  Honey, I need to get Apple Music in the car,
[14:14.140 --> 14:18.500]  so we're going to have to buy a new car.
[14:18.500 --> 14:22.100]  Here, sign this.
[14:22.100 --> 14:23.540]  Co-sign this lease with me.
[14:27.220 --> 14:29.860]  Co-sign?
[14:29.860 --> 14:31.700]  Oh, she's the only name on it?
[14:31.700 --> 14:40.020]  I'm putting the whole thing on her.
[14:40.020 --> 14:41.540]  I thought that the.
[14:44.260 --> 14:46.380]  So you got your license back is what you're saying.
[14:46.380 --> 14:46.900]  Oh, I did.
[14:46.900 --> 14:48.540]  I got that back a couple of years ago.
[14:48.540 --> 14:50.900]  OK.
[14:50.900 --> 14:55.500]  I think it's such an ambitious undertaking,
[14:55.500 --> 14:56.900]  the whole Apple Music thing.
[14:56.900 --> 15:03.900]  And I totally understand the one foot on the shore,
[15:03.900 --> 15:05.420]  one foot on the boat.
[15:05.420 --> 15:06.940]  It's kind of hard to make this shift
[15:06.940 --> 15:09.660]  from being a download-focused service
[15:09.660 --> 15:11.900]  that you don't want to just pull the plug on
[15:11.900 --> 15:13.940]  and that you still want to support.
[15:13.940 --> 15:16.140]  So if people do just want to buy albums,
[15:16.140 --> 15:20.580]  you can still do it to this new streaming thing.
[15:20.580 --> 15:23.860]  I totally realize how complex this is.
[15:23.860 --> 15:25.780]  And I agree with you that on the content side,
[15:25.780 --> 15:26.820]  I think they nailed it.
[15:26.820 --> 15:29.260]  I think from everything I've heard,
[15:29.260 --> 15:32.180]  people really like these stations, the ones that
[15:32.180 --> 15:33.660]  are human-curated.
[15:33.660 --> 15:34.660]  People really like.
[15:34.660 --> 15:36.100]  People even like Beats 1.
[15:36.100 --> 15:36.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[15:36.780 --> 15:39.220]  Which I can't bear.
[15:39.220 --> 15:41.580]  I mean, to me, that was the whole purpose
[15:41.580 --> 15:44.220]  of this digital music process was
[15:44.220 --> 15:46.020]  to get away from that kind of thing.
[15:46.020 --> 15:47.860]  I don't want to hear somebody talking.
[15:47.860 --> 15:51.580]  So it's not for me, but I'm kind of amazed that so many people
[15:51.580 --> 15:53.180]  seem to like it.
[15:53.180 --> 15:56.540]  Yeah, to me, I think it's sort of trying
[15:56.540 --> 16:00.100]  to be what MTV was in the 80s.
[16:00.100 --> 16:02.540]  Here's what everybody's listening to,
[16:02.540 --> 16:06.060]  where everybody is people who care about new music.
[16:06.060 --> 16:10.020]  But when we were in the 80s, there was just one MTV.
[16:10.020 --> 16:11.940]  That was it.
[16:11.940 --> 16:15.980]  And the top 10 countdown every day at 5 o'clock
[16:15.980 --> 16:18.580]  or whatever time it came on would play everything
[16:18.580 --> 16:25.260]  from Motley Crue to Madonna to Lionel Richie.
[16:25.260 --> 16:27.980]  It wasn't really segregated by genres.
[16:27.980 --> 16:30.820]  It was just here's popular music for everything
[16:30.820 --> 16:33.860]  from heavy metal to dance music or whatever
[16:33.860 --> 16:36.420]  you want to call it.
[16:36.420 --> 16:37.900]  And here's what's new.
[16:37.900 --> 16:39.780]  And I feel like that's sort of what they're
[16:39.780 --> 16:41.140]  trying to do with Beats 1.
[16:41.140 --> 16:43.540]  Yeah, that's what it seems like.
[16:43.540 --> 16:46.500]  But on the flip side, somebody has
[16:46.500 --> 16:49.500]  to make an app that presents all this.
[16:49.500 --> 16:53.020]  And I do think it's kind of complicated.
[16:53.020 --> 16:55.660]  And the other complaints that I've heard from some people,
[16:55.660 --> 16:58.420]  and maybe it's just the nature of the sort of people
[16:58.420 --> 17:04.020]  who like to read my stuff, that it's picky people.
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.460]  But the thing that seems to drive some people really crazy
[17:06.460 --> 17:09.700]  is that if you don't sign up for Apple Music
[17:09.700 --> 17:12.900]  and you're not even interested in it,
[17:12.900 --> 17:17.620]  the new music app is like there's
[17:17.620 --> 17:22.140]  tabs that just don't apply to you anymore.
[17:22.140 --> 17:24.820]  And the other thing I know that people have complained about
[17:24.820 --> 17:26.500]  is when you do sign up for Apple Music,
[17:26.500 --> 17:31.220]  it puts my music last in the tabs.
[17:31.220 --> 17:34.740]  And I thought that was sort of like a weird thing
[17:34.740 --> 17:35.620]  to complain about.
[17:35.620 --> 17:38.700]  It's sort of like is the rightmost tab
[17:38.700 --> 17:39.980]  the least important tab?
[17:39.980 --> 17:40.900]  I don't know.
[17:40.900 --> 17:43.260]  But I brought that up to my wife, and Amy agreed.
[17:43.260 --> 17:45.100]  She was like, oh, yeah, to me, she
[17:45.100 --> 17:47.060]  thought that implies that's the least
[17:47.060 --> 17:49.020]  important thing in the app.
[17:49.020 --> 17:52.820]  Whereas it might be, depending on the size of your music
[17:52.820 --> 17:56.820]  library, you might have like 40 or 50 gigabytes of music,
[17:56.820 --> 17:59.780]  and it's all stuffed into one tab in the lower right.
[17:59.780 --> 18:00.620]  Right.
[18:00.620 --> 18:03.580]  Yeah, I mean, the nice thing, one of the improvements
[18:03.580 --> 18:08.380]  that I found was going in, and you can turn off Connect.
[18:08.380 --> 18:10.420]  And what is it?
[18:10.420 --> 18:14.820]  It's like restrictions, I think.
[18:14.820 --> 18:18.260]  Because it's sort of like you don't want your kid.
[18:18.260 --> 18:19.860]  You want your kid to have the iPod Touch,
[18:19.860 --> 18:22.460]  but you don't want your kid to see like Musician's Swearing
[18:22.460 --> 18:23.380]  or something like that.
[18:23.380 --> 18:24.700]  I guess that's what that's for.
[18:24.700 --> 18:26.380]  But you can turn off Connect, and then
[18:26.380 --> 18:29.180]  when you turn off Connect, it puts the Playlist tab
[18:29.180 --> 18:32.460]  in the spot where Connect is.
[18:32.460 --> 18:33.380]  So that was kind of nice.
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.840]  That actually made it a lot better.
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.940]  Because since I use Playlist so much.
[18:40.460 --> 18:41.380]  And you don't really.
[18:41.380 --> 18:42.700]  Oh, man.
[18:42.700 --> 18:44.260]  You don't really connect that often.
[18:44.260 --> 18:46.020]  And I don't really connect that often.
[18:46.020 --> 18:47.060]  Right.
[18:47.060 --> 18:48.140]  I never leave the house.
[18:48.140 --> 18:50.740]  So why would I need Connect?
[18:50.740 --> 18:51.540]  I haven't really.
[18:51.540 --> 18:53.240]  That's one of the things I haven't really
[18:53.240 --> 18:54.580]  heard anybody follow up on.
[18:54.580 --> 18:57.500]  Is Connect working?
[18:57.500 --> 18:58.460]  Are people using it?
[18:58.460 --> 18:59.460]  Is it taking off?
[18:59.460 --> 19:01.020]  Is it really?
[19:01.020 --> 19:04.660]  Or is it ping all over again and nobody's using it?
[19:04.660 --> 19:07.540]  Or is it somewhere in between?
[19:07.540 --> 19:08.540]  Yeah.
[19:08.540 --> 19:10.540]  I haven't seen anybody even talk about it really.
[19:10.540 --> 19:13.580]  No, not since it came out.
[19:13.580 --> 19:19.900]  It seems like it's just kind of a blog for the artists in a way.
[19:19.900 --> 19:24.060]  I mean, they just seem to post where they are,
[19:24.060 --> 19:29.820]  post some pictures and maybe a little commentary.
[19:29.820 --> 19:33.780]  But I didn't find it very interesting or useful
[19:33.780 --> 19:36.380]  at this point anyway.
[19:36.380 --> 19:38.260]  And they had written something about saying
[19:38.260 --> 19:40.940]  that they were going to bring more to it later.
[19:40.940 --> 19:43.260]  But at this point, it was not really.
[19:43.260 --> 19:45.620]  It's just not the kind of thing that I'm interested in.
[19:45.620 --> 19:48.380]  Yeah.
[19:48.380 --> 19:51.140]  So are you an iTunes Match customer?
[19:51.140 --> 19:54.420]  No, I haven't been.
[19:54.420 --> 19:56.420]  So I don't know if that makes it better.
[19:56.420 --> 19:58.540]  Yeah, I feel like that's sort of the point.
[19:58.540 --> 20:00.180]  I feel like that's the problem.
[20:00.180 --> 20:02.020]  Or the perfect storm of the problem.
[20:02.020 --> 20:02.740]  I don't know.
[20:02.740 --> 20:04.860]  And it never worked that well.
[20:04.860 --> 20:05.780]  I don't know.
[20:05.780 --> 20:07.140]  I think I was telling, see, this is one of those things.
[20:07.140 --> 20:07.980]  I don't know if it got cut.
[20:07.980 --> 20:11.380]  But I'll just tell the story again, where Amy, where iTunes,
[20:11.380 --> 20:13.660]  I forget if you can even sign up for a family plan there.
[20:13.660 --> 20:19.780]  But Amy has, I don't know how many gigabytes of music.
[20:19.780 --> 20:23.500]  But she's got enough music where it's like her total,
[20:23.500 --> 20:24.220]  it's pretty big.
[20:24.220 --> 20:28.460]  And it's like she could never sync her whole library
[20:28.460 --> 20:30.260]  to her phone.
[20:30.260 --> 20:31.420]  Otherwise, it would fill up.
[20:31.420 --> 20:36.100]  So she got the 128 gigabyte iPhone.
[20:36.100 --> 20:40.300]  And now she can sync her whole library and have tons.
[20:40.300 --> 20:42.140]  It's one of those things where I think
[20:42.140 --> 20:44.940]  with a 64 gigabyte phone, combined
[20:44.940 --> 20:47.900]  with a photo library and stuff, it would be tight.
[20:47.900 --> 20:51.140]  And with 128, then she has plenty of room,
[20:51.140 --> 20:54.220]  including every single song she has in her iTunes library,
[20:54.220 --> 20:55.220]  which is what she wants.
[20:55.220 --> 20:57.900]  So that if she gets in the mood to listen to something,
[20:57.900 --> 21:00.580]  she can listen to it.
[21:00.580 --> 21:02.060]  And I don't know.
[21:02.060 --> 21:06.580]  She's had Jeffrey Zeldman luck with cloud services.
[21:06.580 --> 21:08.780]  It's like I would set her up, and it
[21:08.780 --> 21:10.660]  would say that she wants it all there.
[21:10.660 --> 21:12.280]  She doesn't want to have to stream it.
[21:12.280 --> 21:13.780]  She doesn't want the cloud icons.
[21:13.780 --> 21:15.400]  She wants all of her music on the phone,
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.100]  because she paid for the giant 128 gigabyte phone.
[21:19.100 --> 21:21.300]  And it looks like it's all there, and then it's there.
[21:21.300 --> 21:24.980]  And then a couple of months ago, she came back from the gym,
[21:24.980 --> 21:27.900]  and she's mad at me, not mad at Apple.
[21:27.900 --> 21:31.380]  She's mad at me, because all of her music is in the cloud.
[21:31.380 --> 21:32.760]  And I'm like, well, that can't be.
[21:32.760 --> 21:34.140]  And then I look at her music app,
[21:34.140 --> 21:37.940]  and every single song is in the cloud.
[21:37.940 --> 21:40.700]  And I can't explain it.
[21:40.700 --> 21:41.460]  I don't understand.
[21:41.460 --> 21:42.380]  So the way I fixed it.
[21:42.380 --> 21:44.100]  And that was before music?
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.460]  Yes, before Apple Music.
[21:45.460 --> 21:48.460]  So the way I fixed it for her is I just turned off
[21:48.460 --> 21:52.040]  iCloud match, iTunes match, whatever it's called,
[21:52.040 --> 21:54.960]  and just hooked her up by a USB cable to her Mac
[21:54.960 --> 21:58.100]  and just synced it the 2007 way.
[21:58.100 --> 22:01.300]  Just hooked her up to iTunes, said sync all of the music,
[22:01.300 --> 22:03.060]  all of her playlists.
[22:03.060 --> 22:05.180]  And I said, I fixed your iTunes cloud.
[22:05.180 --> 22:07.020]  And she said, thank you.
[22:07.020 --> 22:10.420]  And she went, and now she thinks that iTunes cloud
[22:10.420 --> 22:12.660]  works perfectly.
[22:12.660 --> 22:15.380]  Well, wasn't the whole thing with match
[22:15.380 --> 22:17.540]  that you would just sign up once,
[22:17.540 --> 22:20.820]  and it would match your previous catalog,
[22:20.820 --> 22:23.940]  and then basically give you rights to everything
[22:23.940 --> 22:26.940]  that you got from Napster or whatever?
[22:26.940 --> 22:31.300]  And then you just can cancel your subscription
[22:31.300 --> 22:32.660]  for the second year.
[22:32.660 --> 22:34.980]  You don't really need it unless you want it.
[22:34.980 --> 22:38.180]  So in her situation, she doesn't even want it in the cloud,
[22:38.180 --> 22:40.180]  so she wouldn't really, past that first year,
[22:40.180 --> 22:42.460]  have any need to have an iTunes match.
[22:42.460 --> 22:43.820]  Right, but there was supposed to be a way
[22:43.820 --> 22:46.360]  that you could just say, but I also want all my music
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.020]  on the device, you know?
[22:48.020 --> 22:48.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:48.860 --> 22:51.500]  I don't wanna have to pull it down by on-demand.
[22:51.500 --> 22:52.860]  But anyway, a long story short.
[22:52.860 --> 22:54.620]  And that is definitely currently the one thing
[22:54.620 --> 22:56.280]  that I find completely fiddly
[22:56.280 --> 22:58.460]  and I don't quite understand yet is,
[22:58.460 --> 23:00.820]  because I like having it all on the device too,
[23:00.820 --> 23:03.940]  partially because I have a Sonos and I wanna play,
[23:03.940 --> 23:05.260]  and I wanna play something on the Sonos
[23:05.260 --> 23:06.340]  that has to be on the device,
[23:06.340 --> 23:09.340]  at least until they get Apple Music,
[23:09.340 --> 23:11.860]  which they said that they're going to be doing.
[23:11.860 --> 23:13.940]  But if I wanna play something on the Sonos,
[23:13.940 --> 23:17.180]  it has to be on my phone.
[23:17.180 --> 23:18.140]  Right.
[23:18.140 --> 23:19.260]  I have to have something,
[23:19.260 --> 23:20.540]  I have to have it physically someplace
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.900]  in order to play it, obviously.
[23:21.900 --> 23:23.820]  I can't play it from Apple's cloud
[23:23.820 --> 23:26.240]  because Sonos doesn't know anything about Apple's cloud.
[23:26.240 --> 23:31.240]  So, and just trying to do that often befuddles me.
[23:31.240 --> 23:32.680]  But I think it's gotten a little bit easier
[23:32.680 --> 23:33.880]  with an update they recently did
[23:33.880 --> 23:35.880]  because I think, and maybe I just,
[23:35.880 --> 23:37.320]  it was there before and I just missed it,
[23:37.320 --> 23:40.720]  but now you can go into like a playlist
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.720]  and just say, make this entire playlist available offline.
[23:46.480 --> 23:48.320]  Yeah, I don't know.
[23:48.320 --> 23:50.560]  And it should download all the music.
[23:50.560 --> 23:53.200]  So my suggestion, my suggestion,
[23:53.200 --> 23:55.280]  and it was just a flippant offhand,
[23:55.280 --> 23:58.280]  and maybe I'm just waving my hands here
[23:58.280 --> 23:59.480]  and there's good reasons for it,
[23:59.480 --> 24:01.760]  but my suggestion that I tossed out there
[24:01.760 --> 24:04.880]  is why not make it an all new app?
[24:04.880 --> 24:06.600]  Just have an Apple Music app.
[24:06.600 --> 24:08.720]  And then if you sign up for Apple Music,
[24:08.720 --> 24:12.160]  you use the Apple Music app and it streams all the radio.
[24:12.160 --> 24:15.960]  And the thing I'm thinking, just loosely,
[24:15.960 --> 24:18.280]  maybe I'm being stupid somehow,
[24:18.280 --> 24:19.560]  maybe I'm overlooking something.
[24:19.560 --> 24:22.280]  And yes, if you have an iTunes library of songs
[24:22.280 --> 24:25.480]  that you already own, that app could just see those songs
[24:25.480 --> 24:26.320]  and show them to you,
[24:26.320 --> 24:28.560]  but it would never try to delete them.
[24:28.560 --> 24:29.680]  It would never try to delete them
[24:29.680 --> 24:31.880]  or do anything magic with them.
[24:33.240 --> 24:34.400]  And then you'd have two apps.
[24:34.400 --> 24:35.960]  And then if you don't want Apple Music,
[24:35.960 --> 24:38.160]  you could just keep using iTunes,
[24:38.160 --> 24:40.200]  which would play your music.
[24:40.200 --> 24:41.600]  And then iTunes could be iTunes.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.840]  And then Apple Music could be this app
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.840]  that much like the new Photos for Mac app
[24:49.040 --> 24:50.800]  is like a clean slate,
[24:50.800 --> 24:54.800]  both in terms of the interface it presents
[24:54.800 --> 24:58.920]  and in terms of the online syncing stuff
[24:58.920 --> 25:00.760]  that it's supposed to do.
[25:00.760 --> 25:03.560]  And there were a bunch of people, like reactions.
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.200]  A lot of the stuff I write often gets polarized reactions,
[25:07.200 --> 25:10.480]  but this was so completely polarized, it blew me away,
[25:10.480 --> 25:13.760]  where it seemed like half the people responding to that
[25:13.760 --> 25:15.880]  were like, yes, exactly.
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.460]  This is exactly what Apple should have done.
[25:17.460 --> 25:19.720]  And the other half were, you're an idiot.
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.200]  You're completely missing the fact that the entire...
[25:23.200 --> 25:24.320]  But here's what's funny.
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.840]  I kind of agree with both sides.
[25:25.840 --> 25:27.360]  Obviously I agree with the side that says,
[25:27.360 --> 25:28.840]  this sounds like an interesting idea.
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.140]  And the people who say I'm an idiot,
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.840]  which is like half the reaction,
[25:31.840 --> 25:33.960]  were saying the entire point of this
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.760]  is to have all of your music in one app.
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.160]  What was the slogan at WWC was one thought about music.
[25:42.600 --> 25:43.960]  And I see the appeal of that.
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.720]  But my response to that response, I guess,
[25:47.720 --> 25:50.600]  is one thought about music sounds good.
[25:50.600 --> 25:51.960]  It sounds like a good idea.
[25:51.960 --> 25:54.640]  But I'm saying that if you look at the actual software,
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.920]  especially iTunes on Mac, or I guess Windows,
[25:58.920 --> 26:00.320]  which is probably the same,
[26:03.120 --> 26:05.360]  it's more complicated now than it ever has been.
[26:05.360 --> 26:06.780]  And we've been complaining about
[26:06.780 --> 26:09.800]  how complicated it is for years,
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.200]  at least since the iPhone came out.
[26:13.680 --> 26:16.960]  Sometime around that era is when people started complaining
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.540]  that iTunes had too much on its shoulders.
[26:20.540 --> 26:23.140]  And now with Apple Music in there, too,
[26:23.140 --> 26:24.180]  it's more than ever.
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.740]  It's all of the store.
[26:25.740 --> 26:30.740]  It still has, you could still buy iOS apps in iTunes.
[26:31.180 --> 26:35.100]  So it's all the music store, the entire iOS app store,
[26:35.100 --> 26:36.560]  but not the Mac app store.
[26:38.340 --> 26:40.300]  All of your music that you own.
[26:40.300 --> 26:42.620]  And now it's got all of the Apple Music stuff
[26:42.620 --> 26:43.660]  that you subscribe to.
[26:43.660 --> 26:46.460]  To me, that's an awful lot that you're asking one app to do.
[26:46.460 --> 26:49.800]  Mm-hmm, it seems like, yeah.
[26:50.860 --> 26:55.860]  I mean, it does seem like it should be broken apart,
[26:56.460 --> 26:58.440]  and it's easy to say that,
[26:58.440 --> 27:01.780]  because we don't know any of the real reasons
[27:01.780 --> 27:04.020]  why it's actually one app, particularly.
[27:04.020 --> 27:04.860]  Right.
[27:04.860 --> 27:09.780]  But at this point, it's just completely unwieldy.
[27:09.780 --> 27:11.720]  Right, Marco mentioned it too in his post
[27:11.720 --> 27:14.860]  that it's easy to think of a lot of reasons
[27:14.860 --> 27:16.300]  why they didn't go that route,
[27:16.300 --> 27:17.820]  why they might have fully considered it
[27:17.820 --> 27:19.220]  and decided not to go that route.
[27:19.220 --> 27:21.140]  And I'm not saying they should have.
[27:21.140 --> 27:25.380]  I'm just tossing this as an idea of maybe they could have,
[27:25.380 --> 27:26.960]  and maybe things would be better.
[27:26.960 --> 27:29.620]  The one thought that occurs to me about it is
[27:31.100 --> 27:32.780]  it might have taken a lot longer.
[27:32.780 --> 27:35.780]  I mean, look how long photos for Mac took.
[27:35.780 --> 27:38.860]  It was announced at WWDC last year.
[27:38.860 --> 27:40.500]  And they even said when they announced it,
[27:40.500 --> 27:42.700]  it would be early 2015.
[27:42.700 --> 27:44.860]  I think they said early 2015.
[27:44.860 --> 27:48.700]  Or at least they said it's not coming soon.
[27:48.700 --> 27:50.100]  And it still didn't ship.
[27:50.100 --> 27:53.020]  It didn't come out of beta until April or May.
[27:53.020 --> 27:54.460]  I mean, it was very close to a year
[27:54.460 --> 27:57.260]  after they announced it at WWDC 2014
[27:57.260 --> 28:02.040]  before photos for Mac shipped not as a beta for Mac.
[28:03.380 --> 28:06.520]  It absolutely takes longer to start over,
[28:06.520 --> 28:09.420]  even if your goal is to have a simpler,
[28:09.420 --> 28:11.100]  less complicated interface.
[28:12.320 --> 28:13.980]  So maybe that's the main reason.
[28:13.980 --> 28:15.960]  I don't know, that it's always easier
[28:15.960 --> 28:17.820]  to just keep tacking on to iTunes
[28:17.820 --> 28:20.140]  than to take the time to start something new.
[28:24.060 --> 28:26.460]  Yeah, every once in a while you read one of these
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.940]  opinion pieces or someone says
[28:29.940 --> 28:31.300]  that Apple's the new Microsoft,
[28:31.300 --> 28:32.580]  which I think is ridiculous.
[28:32.580 --> 28:34.300]  But this is like one instance
[28:34.300 --> 28:37.400]  where I actually think it kind of does apply
[28:37.400 --> 28:40.120]  in that iTunes does seem like it's just become
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.340]  so overburdened with added features
[28:43.340 --> 28:47.640]  that it's like Office was back in the early 2000s.
[28:49.180 --> 28:51.540]  Well, it is, as a general rule,
[28:51.540 --> 28:54.220]  the idea that you just keep tacking into this one app
[28:54.220 --> 28:57.920]  is sort of the Microsoft, in loose, general terms,
[28:57.920 --> 29:00.140]  it's sort of a Microsoft way of doing things
[29:00.140 --> 29:02.660]  and not the Apple way of doing things.
[29:02.660 --> 29:06.340]  Yeah, and they've never gotten rid of anything.
[29:06.340 --> 29:07.180]  Right, I mean, and just comparing-
[29:07.180 --> 29:08.860]  And the Apple, it seems like,
[29:08.860 --> 29:11.700]  we used to go through this throughout the 2000s
[29:11.700 --> 29:13.660]  where iMovie and things like that
[29:13.660 --> 29:14.840]  where they would take something
[29:14.840 --> 29:17.340]  and then just blow it up and start all over again,
[29:17.340 --> 29:19.340]  and you'd lose things.
[29:20.300 --> 29:23.560]  But often you'd end up with a better app.
[29:24.560 --> 29:25.900]  And in this instance,
[29:25.900 --> 29:28.040]  they don't seem to be doing that at all.
[29:29.320 --> 29:34.320]  What about, do they still have podcasts in iTunes?
[29:35.120 --> 29:38.240]  I know on iOS, see, that's a perfect example, right?
[29:38.240 --> 29:40.580]  So on iOS, they, yeah.
[29:40.580 --> 29:44.860]  So in iOS, they created an entirely separate podcast app.
[29:44.860 --> 29:49.180]  And on the whole, it's what matters anyway,
[29:49.180 --> 29:51.740]  because I mean, I know from the stats from this show
[29:51.740 --> 29:55.180]  that most people listen to podcasts on their phone
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.380]  or some kind of mobile device, so it makes sense.
[29:58.380 --> 30:00.540]  But it's crazy that on the desktop,
[30:00.540 --> 30:04.980]  they still have podcasts in there too, right?
[30:04.980 --> 30:06.580]  And maybe that's another sign
[30:06.580 --> 30:08.820]  of the Mac as a second-class citizen to iOS
[30:08.820 --> 30:11.180]  that they don't make a standalone version of.
[30:11.180 --> 30:12.720]  Can you tell what the client is?
[30:12.720 --> 30:16.180]  Can you tell what the biggest usage by client is?
[30:16.180 --> 30:18.580]  Yeah. On the iOS?
[30:18.580 --> 30:20.600]  Is it the podcast's app or something else?
[30:20.600 --> 30:23.080]  Well, for me, it's Overcast.
[30:23.080 --> 30:24.420]  Yeah, okay.
[30:24.420 --> 30:27.020]  Right, there's a little bit of selection bias there.
[30:27.020 --> 30:28.220]  Yeah, without question.
[30:28.220 --> 30:32.620]  It's because Daring Fireball readers
[30:32.620 --> 30:35.020]  and listeners of this show are way more likely
[30:35.020 --> 30:39.220]  to even have heard of Overcast,
[30:39.220 --> 30:42.940]  let alone be smart enough to actually sign up for it.
[30:45.980 --> 30:48.180]  And somebody sent me, after I tweeted,
[30:48.180 --> 30:49.300]  I think I tweeted that?
[30:49.300 --> 30:54.300]  I tweeted the stats that I get from SoundCloud,
[30:57.020 --> 30:59.740]  which is where I host the audio for this.
[30:59.740 --> 31:01.660]  And they said that they're the producer
[31:01.660 --> 31:04.260]  on a general interest podcast.
[31:04.260 --> 31:05.220]  Seemed pretty popular.
[31:05.220 --> 31:10.220]  It's some 20 or 30,000 downloads per episode.
[31:12.920 --> 31:15.540]  And for them, Overcast was way down.
[31:15.540 --> 31:16.780]  I mean, it wasn't even close
[31:16.780 --> 31:20.420]  because it was even behind other iOS clients
[31:20.420 --> 31:22.420]  just because it hasn't been out as long.
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.500]  But I don't get it.
[31:26.500 --> 31:28.180]  I'm trying to look it up here.
[31:28.180 --> 31:29.680]  Where's the stats?
[31:29.680 --> 31:34.680]  It doesn't say podcasts for iOS.
[31:35.720 --> 31:38.520]  It's called, it's the background process
[31:38.520 --> 31:42.040]  that does the downloading.
[31:42.040 --> 31:42.880]  Oh, okay.
[31:44.120 --> 31:45.400]  So you probably can't tell
[31:45.400 --> 31:47.640]  if it's the difference between that.
[31:47.640 --> 31:49.280]  Apple Core Media.
[31:49.280 --> 31:51.400]  Yeah, if it's the difference between that
[31:51.400 --> 31:54.280]  and iTunes on a Mac.
[31:54.280 --> 31:56.560]  Well, no, you can tell by platform.
[31:56.560 --> 31:58.120]  No, but then it says,
[31:58.120 --> 32:02.760]  so here's my stats for the previous episode
[32:02.760 --> 32:05.360]  with Jason Snell, episode 126.
[32:08.920 --> 32:13.280]  So for the RSS version, which is just about everybody,
[32:13.280 --> 32:16.080]  Overcast is 29,000.
[32:16.080 --> 32:18.240]  Apple Core Media iPhone,
[32:18.240 --> 32:23.160]  which I take to mean the podcast app on iPhone,
[32:23.160 --> 32:25.300]  this is about 17,000.
[32:25.300 --> 32:28.160]  Then there's iTunes, which is 4,500.
[32:28.160 --> 32:30.100]  And I think that's iTunes on the Mac.
[32:31.180 --> 32:33.560]  Apple Core Media iPad.
[32:33.560 --> 32:34.400]  So it's interesting.
[32:34.400 --> 32:39.400]  I do get it broken out between iPhone and iPad is 2,700.
[32:39.400 --> 32:41.960]  Mozilla is 2,400.
[32:41.960 --> 32:43.480]  And I think Mozilla means,
[32:43.480 --> 32:44.920]  see, this is where I have to guess.
[32:44.920 --> 32:47.560]  I think it means anybody who listens in any browser,
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.400]  because you know how like every browser says
[32:49.400 --> 32:51.880]  that they're like Mozilla?
[32:51.880 --> 32:54.840]  Right, because there's no freaking way
[32:54.840 --> 32:56.120]  that Mozilla would come,
[32:56.120 --> 32:59.240]  the actual Mozilla would come in ahead of Safari.
[33:01.240 --> 33:05.000]  And then Downcast at a respectable 1,900.
[33:05.000 --> 33:06.920]  Pocket Casts at 1,700.
[33:06.920 --> 33:09.280]  Instacast, Castro.
[33:09.280 --> 33:12.400]  And then Way Down at 200.
[33:12.400 --> 33:15.040]  Poor old Apple Core Media for iPod.
[33:15.040 --> 33:16.840]  Yeah.
[33:16.840 --> 33:17.680]  Aw.
[33:20.440 --> 33:21.360]  Very sad.
[33:22.360 --> 33:24.320]  Not many, and I figured,
[33:24.320 --> 33:25.720]  I would have said a year ago,
[33:25.720 --> 33:27.700]  I would have joked that one of them was John Siracusa,
[33:27.700 --> 33:29.120]  but now he's got an iPhone.
[33:29.120 --> 33:29.960]  That's right.
[33:32.000 --> 33:33.480]  No, so I do have good stats like that.
[33:33.480 --> 33:34.440]  That's interesting.
[33:35.600 --> 33:38.800]  But to me, it's crazy that they still stick podcasts
[33:38.800 --> 33:40.440]  in the iTunes.
[33:41.560 --> 33:43.400]  I don't even know why.
[33:43.400 --> 33:44.760]  Yeah.
[33:44.760 --> 33:46.560]  And I wonder if some of it is just about,
[33:46.560 --> 33:48.960]  they feel like if they put it in a different app now
[33:48.960 --> 33:52.440]  that people are gonna not open the other app,
[33:52.440 --> 33:55.080]  particularly for like a new service like music.
[33:56.220 --> 33:58.920]  Well, and I guess it's so that there's,
[33:58.920 --> 33:59.880]  I mean, they're called,
[33:59.880 --> 34:02.380]  I even, did I tweet this or blog it?
[34:02.380 --> 34:03.220]  I always forget.
[34:03.220 --> 34:05.940]  But it's funny that we call them podcasts,
[34:05.940 --> 34:08.240]  but nobody listens on iPods anymore.
[34:08.240 --> 34:11.060]  Everybody listens on iPhones and stuff.
[34:11.060 --> 34:16.060]  But if you do listen to it on your iPod,
[34:16.260 --> 34:17.580]  and it's not an iPod touch,
[34:17.580 --> 34:19.980]  it's like an iPod iPod,
[34:19.980 --> 34:22.820]  then I guess you still need to sync it from iTunes.
[34:22.820 --> 34:24.360]  Right.
[34:24.360 --> 34:27.680]  So I guess I understand why they haven't taken it out
[34:27.680 --> 34:29.820]  for people who need to sync to an iPod,
[34:29.820 --> 34:31.740]  but for anybody who just wants to listen to it,
[34:31.740 --> 34:34.060]  I really think it ought to be a standalone app,
[34:34.060 --> 34:35.220]  even on the Mac,
[34:35.220 --> 34:38.860]  that works just like the iOS podcast app.
[34:38.860 --> 34:39.700]  Yeah.
[34:39.700 --> 34:41.520]  But what do I know?
[34:43.060 --> 34:43.900]  Huh.
[34:45.900 --> 34:47.260]  Maybe that's next.
[34:47.260 --> 34:48.100]  Yeah, I don't know.
[34:48.100 --> 34:49.060]  Keep hoping.
[34:49.060 --> 34:49.900]  Well.
[34:52.540 --> 34:56.260]  That and the app store for the Apple TV.
[34:58.940 --> 35:00.260]  Someday they'll come.
[35:02.020 --> 35:03.180]  All right, let me take a break
[35:03.180 --> 35:05.280]  and thank our first sponsor.
[35:05.280 --> 35:08.340]  It is our good friends at Casper.
[35:08.340 --> 35:12.120]  Casper makes an obsessively engineered mattress
[35:12.120 --> 35:14.580]  at a shockingly fair price.
[35:14.580 --> 35:17.960]  Just the right sync, just the right bounce.
[35:17.960 --> 35:20.640]  They don't give you all these different types of mattresses
[35:20.640 --> 35:21.480]  to choose from.
[35:21.480 --> 35:23.120]  They've got one type of technology.
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.420]  They combine latex foam and memory foam.
[35:26.420 --> 35:30.300]  They come together for one style of mattress,
[35:30.300 --> 35:32.500]  and you're gonna sleep great on this thing.
[35:33.420 --> 35:36.140]  Free delivery, painless returns,
[35:36.140 --> 35:39.940]  and their mattresses are made right here in the USA,
[35:39.940 --> 35:41.760]  right here in the USA.
[35:41.760 --> 35:42.600]  Here's the prices.
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.620]  If you know anything about shop,
[35:43.620 --> 35:45.260]  if you've shopped for a mattress
[35:45.260 --> 35:46.540]  anytime in your adult life,
[35:46.540 --> 35:51.060]  you know that there's no other word for it than a racket.
[35:51.060 --> 35:52.280]  It's an absolute racket.
[35:52.280 --> 35:55.460]  You go to like Mattress USA or something like that,
[35:55.460 --> 35:58.620]  and you shop the Sealy or whatever brand you want,
[35:58.620 --> 35:59.540]  and you write them down.
[35:59.540 --> 36:01.460]  You write down what they cost, what the model names are.
[36:01.460 --> 36:05.160]  You drive across town to Mattress King
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.980]  or whatever the hell the next store is called,
[36:06.980 --> 36:08.460]  and you look at the same brand,
[36:08.460 --> 36:09.980]  and you look at the mattresses.
[36:09.980 --> 36:11.660]  They all have different names,
[36:11.660 --> 36:12.780]  so there's no way to compare.
[36:12.780 --> 36:15.520]  They do this on purpose, so it really is.
[36:15.520 --> 36:18.060]  It's like a racket where each store gets their own
[36:18.060 --> 36:20.240]  model names from the same manufacturer
[36:20.240 --> 36:22.180]  so that you can't price compare,
[36:22.180 --> 36:24.220]  and all the prices are high anyway,
[36:24.220 --> 36:27.320]  and they've got 11 mattresses set up
[36:27.320 --> 36:30.620]  that you're supposed to lay on them in the retail store.
[36:30.620 --> 36:32.520]  Gross, number one, gross.
[36:32.520 --> 36:34.520]  That's how you get lice.
[36:36.520 --> 36:39.160]  It's probably a very good way to get lice.
[36:39.160 --> 36:41.080]  Here's the prices from Casper.
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.080]  500 bucks for two, or not for two, for twin size mattress,
[36:46.280 --> 36:48.680]  950 for a king size mattress,
[36:48.680 --> 36:51.800]  and then in between twin and king are all the price points
[36:51.800 --> 36:53.480]  in between 500 and 950.
[36:53.480 --> 36:57.260]  $950 for a premium king size mattress is crazy.
[36:57.260 --> 37:00.600]  You're never gonna beat that at retail mattress stores.
[37:00.600 --> 37:02.240]  It's an outstanding price point.
[37:02.240 --> 37:04.560]  For a great mattress.
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.500]  Here's the thing though, you don't get to try it beforehand.
[37:06.500 --> 37:09.160]  You don't even get to sit on it or anything like that.
[37:09.160 --> 37:11.380]  You gotta trust it, but here's the deal.
[37:11.380 --> 37:16.380]  They have guaranteed, I think it's like 40 days,
[37:17.240 --> 37:20.760]  I don't know, 100 days, 100 day guarantee.
[37:20.760 --> 37:21.960]  So you buy this thing.
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.760]  It shows up for free, and a vacuum packet
[37:25.760 --> 37:28.160]  in this crazy box that's like the size
[37:28.160 --> 37:31.720]  of a big dorm room refrigerator shows up.
[37:31.720 --> 37:32.920]  They give you a special tool.
[37:32.920 --> 37:34.880]  You take it up to the bedroom where you want it.
[37:34.880 --> 37:37.640]  You open this thing up, and it makes a really cool sound,
[37:37.640 --> 37:39.120]  and then it sucks up all the air,
[37:39.120 --> 37:41.420]  and then all of a sudden you've got a mattress.
[37:42.420 --> 37:45.320]  You've got 100 days from that point to sleep on this thing,
[37:45.320 --> 37:49.200]  and if you don't like it, you just go to their website.
[37:49.200 --> 37:51.400]  No hassle, they just go there.
[37:51.400 --> 37:53.000]  You say, I don't like this mattress.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.920]  Give me my money back, and then they take care.
[37:54.920 --> 37:57.600]  They send like a UPS guy to like get the mattress
[37:57.600 --> 37:59.840]  out of your house, and that's it, it's gone.
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.360]  That's how sure they are that you're gonna like it.
[38:02.360 --> 38:05.000]  I don't think anybody ever takes them up on it.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.540]  It's a great mattress.
[38:06.540 --> 38:07.880]  They sent me one last year.
[38:07.880 --> 38:10.040]  It's like brand new right now.
[38:12.080 --> 38:13.320]  So here's where you go to find out more.
[38:13.320 --> 38:14.520]  You're shopping for a mattress.
[38:14.520 --> 38:16.400]  You cannot beat these guys.
[38:16.400 --> 38:18.160]  The other cool thing, I don't know how many of you guys
[38:18.160 --> 38:20.560]  live in New York, but my understanding is that if you live
[38:20.560 --> 38:23.400]  in New York City, you can get this like same day,
[38:23.400 --> 38:26.180]  and they bring it, like a guy straps it to his back
[38:26.180 --> 38:29.280]  and brings it to your house on a bicycle.
[38:29.280 --> 38:32.720]  That's how crazy the boxes are that these things are.
[38:32.720 --> 38:34.620]  So it might be worth it to buy one of these
[38:34.620 --> 38:38.780]  just to see the guy show up with a mattress on his back.
[38:39.880 --> 38:40.720]  Here's the deal.
[38:40.720 --> 38:45.080]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show.
[38:45.080 --> 38:46.800]  It used to be caspersleep.com.
[38:46.800 --> 38:47.760]  They got a better domain.
[38:47.760 --> 38:48.600]  They upgraded it.
[38:48.600 --> 38:53.600]  It's casper.com, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash the talk show,
[38:54.240 --> 38:56.320]  and by using that code, the talk show.
[38:56.320 --> 38:57.680]  I think if you just go to the URL,
[38:57.680 --> 38:59.760]  the coupon's applied.
[38:59.760 --> 39:01.800]  Otherwise, just remember the coupon,
[39:01.800 --> 39:05.600]  the talk show, all one word, and you'll save 50 bucks.
[39:05.600 --> 39:07.000]  So they're already low prices.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  You'll save 50 bucks.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.380]  Terms and conditions apply.
[39:10.380 --> 39:12.300]  I don't know what the terms and conditions are,
[39:12.300 --> 39:14.980]  but it's a good deal, and I know a lot of listeners
[39:14.980 --> 39:16.560]  have taken them up on this, and I've gotten a lot
[39:16.560 --> 39:18.100]  of feedback from people who are like,
[39:18.100 --> 39:21.440]  it really did sound crazy to buy a mattress from a podcast,
[39:21.440 --> 39:23.380]  but I did, and it was great.
[39:23.380 --> 39:25.640]  So my thanks to Casper.
[39:25.640 --> 39:27.800]  One of the conditions is no lice.
[39:27.800 --> 39:28.620]  Yeah, no lice.
[39:28.620 --> 39:29.460]  That's funny.
[39:29.460 --> 39:33.960]  Nobody has ever laid on this mattress before.
[39:33.960 --> 39:35.060]  Guarantee lice-free.
[39:40.400 --> 39:42.040]  How about the, because this is the thing
[39:42.040 --> 39:44.900]  I wrote the other day, is just thinking about Apple Music
[39:44.900 --> 39:46.320]  and the problems people are having,
[39:46.320 --> 39:49.280]  and my problems, it seems to me like everything's working
[39:49.280 --> 39:51.000]  for me, it's just that I'm confused
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.520]  about how it's supposed to work.
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.520]  Compare and contrast with the new iCloud photo library,
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.680]  which I was more worried about,
[40:00.680 --> 40:03.060]  because I care much more about my photos
[40:03.060 --> 40:07.920]  than I do my music, and I have backups of everything,
[40:07.920 --> 40:10.800]  and I've got stuff, but I just, I don't know,
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.840]  I just worried that it wasn't gonna work.
[40:14.220 --> 40:16.920]  And I backed up my phone beforehand,
[40:16.920 --> 40:19.480]  so that if I turned on this thing,
[40:19.480 --> 40:22.440]  and it erased my photo library on my phone,
[40:22.440 --> 40:24.520]  I could just restore the phone to where I was
[40:24.520 --> 40:25.520]  before I turned it off.
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.320]  I did, I backed up my Mac, I backed up my phone,
[40:29.320 --> 40:32.480]  then I turned this thing on a couple weeks ago, whenever.
[40:33.780 --> 40:36.680]  And it, again, everybody's had the same sort
[40:36.680 --> 40:37.520]  of first reaction.
[40:37.520 --> 40:38.840]  If you have thousands of photos,
[40:38.840 --> 40:41.920]  I think I've got like 17 or 18,000 photos total
[40:43.780 --> 40:47.940]  from my old iPhoto library and what I took on the phone,
[40:49.300 --> 40:51.800]  it did take a while for them to sync initially.
[40:51.800 --> 40:54.400]  I don't know, a couple of days, something like that.
[40:55.560 --> 40:59.240]  And then, but lo and behold, maybe like a day or two,
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.040]  two days after I signed up for this thing
[41:01.040 --> 41:02.960]  and turned it on on all my devices,
[41:02.960 --> 41:05.080]  all of my devices have all my photos,
[41:05.080 --> 41:07.400]  and when I take a photo with my phone,
[41:08.260 --> 41:09.760]  by the time I go to my Mac,
[41:09.760 --> 41:11.200]  even if I'm just sitting here at my desk
[41:11.200 --> 41:13.280]  and I go to the Photos app, there it is.
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.840]  It's right there at the bottom of my, all your photos.
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.840]  It is, you know, and for people who say,
[41:22.360 --> 41:24.840]  Apple never gets cloud services right
[41:24.840 --> 41:27.360]  or something like this, I would say the Photos thing
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.300]  seems like an example where they did.
[41:31.860 --> 41:32.700]  Have you tried it?
[41:32.700 --> 41:33.920]  I have not.
[41:33.920 --> 41:36.160]  I'm actually fiddling with it right now.
[41:36.160 --> 41:41.160]  Just because I was afraid of that initial sync process
[41:41.280 --> 41:46.120]  taking so long, and also just the fact
[41:46.120 --> 41:47.320]  that I felt like I was gonna probably have
[41:47.320 --> 41:48.520]  to upgrade the storage space
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.160]  because I didn't think I was gonna,
[41:50.160 --> 41:51.560]  because I think my libraries,
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.840]  and that was the other thing I was trying to just figure out
[41:52.840 --> 41:56.260]  how big my library is, but that's always been my problem
[41:56.260 --> 41:57.840]  is that I just have too many pictures,
[41:57.840 --> 42:00.160]  and a lot of them are just crap and should be thrown away,
[42:00.160 --> 42:01.920]  but I don't wanna go through that process
[42:01.920 --> 42:04.720]  of going through every single thing
[42:04.720 --> 42:08.140]  and trying to figure out what should go and what should stay.
[42:08.140 --> 42:10.900]  So I have not done it yet,
[42:10.900 --> 42:12.920]  but it sounds like maybe I should.
[42:12.920 --> 42:16.840]  And I tweeted, I guess I blogged about it yesterday,
[42:16.840 --> 42:19.320]  and a couple people on Twitter,
[42:19.320 --> 42:21.600]  obviously it's not working for 100% of all people.
[42:21.600 --> 42:23.240]  There's some, I don't know.
[42:23.240 --> 42:25.440]  Does anything ever work for 100% of all people?
[42:25.440 --> 42:27.000]  I don't know, but it seems to me
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.400]  like there are a lot fewer people encountering problems
[42:29.400 --> 42:31.320]  with the iCloud Photo library
[42:31.320 --> 42:35.520]  than there are people encountering problems with the music.
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.000]  And conceptually, to me, it is very, very simple, right?
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.840]  It's all of your photos and all of your albums
[42:41.840 --> 42:42.960]  across all your devices.
[42:42.960 --> 42:45.060]  And if you have two options,
[42:45.060 --> 42:47.000]  download the originals to this device,
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.480]  whether it's a Mac or iOS thing,
[42:48.480 --> 42:51.160]  and that means you get the original image
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.400]  that was taken from the camera, or optimize.
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.160]  And this is, if there's something that's a little hand wavy,
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.560]  it's what does this optimize photo storage mean?
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.280]  Somehow it means you don't get,
[43:04.280 --> 43:06.920]  on this device, you don't get the full res versions.
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.920]  iCloud will resize them to make sense on your device.
[43:12.380 --> 43:14.700]  And so I guess you get smaller ones on your phone
[43:14.700 --> 43:16.240]  and bigger ones on your Mac.
[43:16.240 --> 43:18.700]  But on either case, if you turn on optimized storage,
[43:18.700 --> 43:21.880]  you're not going to get the original image.
[43:23.540 --> 43:25.600]  The complaint I've seen on Twitter from people
[43:25.600 --> 43:28.020]  is that even with optimized photo storage on,
[43:28.020 --> 43:29.940]  it still takes up too much space,
[43:29.940 --> 43:34.020]  that it's taking up 10 or 20 gigabytes on people's phones.
[43:34.020 --> 43:35.740]  And they don't have that much space,
[43:35.740 --> 43:38.520]  maybe because they bought a 16 gigabyte phone,
[43:38.520 --> 43:41.280]  or 32 or something like that.
[43:41.280 --> 43:42.700]  Which is a reasonable complaint,
[43:42.700 --> 43:45.580]  but then if you have, I guess the argument would be
[43:45.580 --> 43:48.900]  that if you have a space-constricted device,
[43:48.900 --> 43:52.020]  storing your entire photo library even optimized
[43:52.020 --> 43:53.880]  is not a good idea for that device.
[43:55.780 --> 43:57.260]  Because I don't know what the solution would be.
[43:57.260 --> 43:59.740]  I guess Apple could, in theory,
[43:59.740 --> 44:04.340]  store even tinier thumbnails or something.
[44:04.340 --> 44:05.860]  I'm not quite sure.
[44:06.740 --> 44:08.940]  Isn't that what the Google,
[44:08.940 --> 44:12.780]  I mean the Google service goes down real low, doesn't it?
[44:12.780 --> 44:15.780]  I guess because, and maybe that just is their
[44:15.780 --> 44:19.740]  web-based route showing, because something like Flickr
[44:19.740 --> 44:22.360]  or any kind of web-based photo storage service,
[44:22.360 --> 44:25.600]  there's the idea that it even could download all your photos
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.180]  doesn't even make sense, because there's no way to,
[44:28.180 --> 44:30.980]  you only get five megabytes of local storage
[44:30.980 --> 44:34.420]  or whatever the limit is for a website with local storage.
[44:34.420 --> 44:39.420]  Where is, is that stored in, yeah there it is.
[44:39.700 --> 44:40.640]  Oh no, that's not it.
[44:40.640 --> 44:42.660]  Oh there it is, okay yeah, so my library
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.640]  is like almost 50 gigs.
[44:46.260 --> 44:47.860]  Your iPhoto library?
[44:47.860 --> 44:49.360]  My photos library.
[44:51.180 --> 44:53.740]  Oh, because you have upgraded to photos.
[44:53.740 --> 44:55.500]  I've upgraded to photos, yes.
[44:55.500 --> 45:00.500]  How many, how many, how many, how many pictures is it?
[45:00.500 --> 45:04.160]  8,500, yeah, so I've got 16,500.
[45:04.160 --> 45:06.240]  The big things are probably the videos.
[45:06.240 --> 45:07.220]  Yeah, probably.
[45:10.140 --> 45:11.820]  Does it sync the videos too?
[45:11.820 --> 45:14.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they call it photos,
[45:14.640 --> 45:19.080]  but it's just like photos on your phone.
[45:19.080 --> 45:21.480]  It really means anything you shot with a camera.
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.520]  Yeah, I mean it would certainly be very nice to have,
[45:26.520 --> 45:29.880]  but I just, I don't feel like paying for an extra,
[45:29.880 --> 45:34.760]  an extra service, because that's not gonna fit.
[45:34.760 --> 45:36.720]  No, that is not gonna fit.
[45:36.720 --> 45:39.800]  Well, what are you, are you still on the free tier?
[45:39.800 --> 45:41.560]  Yeah, I'm still on the free tier, yeah.
[45:41.560 --> 45:43.780]  Yeah, that ain't gonna work,
[45:43.780 --> 45:46.060]  but that raises a good point though,
[45:46.060 --> 45:49.860]  that it's twofold would be, which was A,
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.360]  why is the free tier still just five gigabytes
[45:55.360 --> 45:58.180]  for this company with 200, again,
[45:58.180 --> 45:59.440]  and it seems like it always comes up
[45:59.440 --> 46:00.280]  when you're on the show.
[46:00.280 --> 46:02.040]  It's like, let's spend Tim Cook's money.
[46:02.040 --> 46:02.880]  Exactly.
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.740]  And so we'll put in our standard disclaimer here
[46:07.740 --> 46:10.200]  that we understand we're not trying to say we're know-it-alls
[46:10.200 --> 46:12.360]  and we know more than Apple how to spend money,
[46:12.360 --> 46:17.360]  but and that the way that you accumulate $200 billion
[46:17.360 --> 46:22.360]  in cash is by maybe not spending your money willy-nilly
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.300]  on every idea that two idiots on a podcast say
[46:25.300 --> 46:27.160]  that you should spend money on.
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.920]  I'm just saying it seems to me though,
[46:29.920 --> 46:33.880]  given what other companies with less money
[46:33.880 --> 46:37.080]  than Apple offer for free storage,
[46:38.360 --> 46:40.740]  it just seems to me like maybe Apple could be
[46:40.740 --> 46:42.760]  a little bit more competitive in that regard
[46:42.760 --> 46:44.520]  as to how big the free tier is
[46:44.520 --> 46:46.080]  and that it would be in their interest
[46:46.080 --> 46:49.460]  in terms of getting more people to use this,
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.980]  the photo syncing, which I think they've put a lot of work
[46:53.980 --> 46:55.800]  into and would like people to use.
[46:55.800 --> 46:56.800]  Right.
[46:56.800 --> 46:58.140]  And then the flip side would be
[46:58.140 --> 47:00.840]  the 16 gigabyte devices thing.
[47:02.200 --> 47:05.000]  Yeah, completely.
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.880]  Because even if, and this was like when I asked Phil Schiller
[47:09.880 --> 47:14.880]  on stage last month, part of his answer defending
[47:15.200 --> 47:17.560]  the 16 gigabyte devices is that more and more
[47:17.560 --> 47:19.800]  of people storage is cloud-based.
[47:19.800 --> 47:23.280]  But even if, as these people responding to me on Twitter
[47:23.280 --> 47:25.880]  are pointing out, even if you turn on optimized photo
[47:25.880 --> 47:29.260]  storage, if you have a lot of photos,
[47:29.260 --> 47:34.260]  it still consumes an awful lot of storage on your device,
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.200]  or at least awful lot if you have a 16 gigabyte device.
[47:39.940 --> 47:41.480]  Yeah, if you have a 16 gigabyte device,
[47:41.480 --> 47:43.580]  you basically don't have any room to spare.
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.000]  Yeah, it's really, it's just, it's,
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.600]  and I lived with a four gigabyte phone for two years.
[47:53.600 --> 47:54.640]  Well, I think it makes sense.
[47:54.640 --> 47:56.880]  This is one of the differences between the music and photos.
[47:56.880 --> 47:59.600]  If you just use the streaming for Apple Music,
[47:59.600 --> 48:02.600]  I guess that makes a lot of sense on a 16 gigabyte device,
[48:02.600 --> 48:04.680]  right, that you don't have anything stored locally
[48:04.680 --> 48:07.780]  or almost nothing, that it really is just cached,
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.600]  and you're listening to the Beats One radio station
[48:11.600 --> 48:12.840]  or something like that.
[48:12.840 --> 48:14.960]  That's fantastic, right, that you can listen
[48:14.960 --> 48:17.780]  to a wide variety of music, you can search for music,
[48:17.780 --> 48:21.280]  you can get the urge to listen to a certain artist,
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.160]  and as long as you've got the bandwidth,
[48:23.160 --> 48:28.080]  if you've got Wi-Fi or enough space on your cellular plan,
[48:28.080 --> 48:31.080]  you can just listen to it without worrying about the storage.
[48:32.280 --> 48:34.340]  But with the photos, even, again,
[48:34.340 --> 48:36.960]  there's just no way to participate in this
[48:36.960 --> 48:38.760]  if you have a lot of photos in your library
[48:38.760 --> 48:41.840]  without using some significant degree of local storage.
[48:41.840 --> 48:46.840]  And 16 gigabytes just is pretty brutally short for that.
[48:50.960 --> 48:52.800]  They don't really sell an eight gigabyte phone anymore,
[48:52.800 --> 48:53.640]  do they?
[48:54.960 --> 48:59.200]  Not new, but not top tier, but if you go
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.680]  and buy an iPhone 5C, it's only eight gigabytes.
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.760]  Is it still, is it?
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[49:06.180 --> 49:07.020]  Oh my God.
[49:07.020 --> 49:07.840]  Yeah, so.
[49:07.840 --> 49:08.880]  Yeah, they still do.
[49:08.880 --> 49:10.720]  Yeah, so for all my complaints about 16.
[49:10.720 --> 49:13.100]  They still sell, you know, I consider that selling it.
[49:13.100 --> 49:17.780]  I mean, you can buy it on lock for $450, but yeah.
[49:17.780 --> 49:18.620]  Yeah, if there's a buy now.
[49:18.620 --> 49:20.040]  Eight gigabyte phone.
[49:20.040 --> 49:25.040]  If there's a buy now button next to it on the website,
[49:25.160 --> 49:27.840]  I guess, yes, technically it is for sale.
[49:27.840 --> 49:28.680]  Yeah, right.
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.880]  But yeah, I think your only choice,
[49:32.880 --> 49:35.920]  yeah, your only choice if you buy a 5C today
[49:35.920 --> 49:37.500]  is to get an eight gigabyte.
[49:37.500 --> 49:39.080]  Right.
[49:39.080 --> 49:40.800]  And you know, it's just the way that it works.
[49:40.800 --> 49:43.160]  So if they don't move the baseline
[49:43.160 --> 49:47.840]  for the brand new top tier 6S and 6S Plus,
[49:47.840 --> 49:49.760]  which again, I'm just guessing
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.840]  that's what they're gonna do in September.
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.520]  If they don't move the baseline up to 32,
[49:54.520 --> 49:56.480]  then I don't know what they're gonna do.
[49:56.480 --> 49:57.640]  Are they gonna, you know,
[49:57.640 --> 49:59.260]  if they keep the storage tiers the same,
[49:59.260 --> 50:01.360]  it seems like all the storage tiers will be the same,
[50:01.360 --> 50:03.400]  and then the mid tier one is still gonna be
[50:03.400 --> 50:07.360]  only 16 gigabytes, and the low end one
[50:07.360 --> 50:08.960]  might still only be eight gigabytes,
[50:08.960 --> 50:10.160]  which seems crazy.
[50:10.160 --> 50:11.000]  Seems crazy.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.400]  That seems completely crazy.
[50:14.860 --> 50:17.320]  I mean, the good news is that they, you know,
[50:17.320 --> 50:20.240]  have done the work to make iOS 9
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.240]  require a lot less storage space initially to upgrade,
[50:26.720 --> 50:28.320]  which was definitely, I mean,
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.260]  they pretty much flat out said it was a problem
[50:30.260 --> 50:32.780]  at WWDC for iOS 8.
[50:34.220 --> 50:36.760]  But for a lot of this stuff, it really is.
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.400]  You couldn't even upgrade your phone.
[50:38.400 --> 50:40.520]  Right, and it's like, and it really,
[50:41.800 --> 50:43.880]  it really starts to,
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.680]  especially I think with the camera stuff,
[50:45.680 --> 50:47.880]  really starts to directly conflict,
[50:47.880 --> 50:49.440]  where it's like how can they brag
[50:49.440 --> 50:51.440]  about how nice the camera is
[50:51.440 --> 50:55.000]  and how high the quality is of the video.
[50:55.000 --> 50:56.840]  When you can store about four pictures.
[50:56.840 --> 50:57.680]  Right.
[51:00.960 --> 51:02.960]  You can take one panoramic photo.
[51:02.960 --> 51:07.760]  Yeah, burst mode, up to two images.
[51:10.680 --> 51:11.520]  Now I know we've talked,
[51:11.520 --> 51:12.680]  I think we've talked about this before,
[51:12.680 --> 51:15.860]  but would you go back to the four inch phone?
[51:17.760 --> 51:19.180]  That's a great question.
[51:22.240 --> 51:25.480]  I, in theory, I would.
[51:25.480 --> 51:28.680]  And in fact, I just spent almost a week
[51:28.680 --> 51:30.760]  using my four inch iPhone 5S
[51:30.760 --> 51:34.240]  because I put iOS 9 on it
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.840]  and I put my SIM card in it
[51:35.840 --> 51:37.680]  so I could actually try it.
[51:37.680 --> 51:41.000]  I've since gone and upgraded my regular iPhone 6
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.480]  to the latest iOS 9 beta
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.000]  because it's that, at least for me,
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.240]  if you go switch to the iOS 9 beta
[51:49.240 --> 51:51.800]  and your phone dies, don't complain to me.
[51:51.800 --> 51:53.040]  But for me at least,
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.480]  it seems at least as solid as iOS 8, so why not?
[51:57.480 --> 51:59.840]  And I really, really like the San Francisco font
[51:59.840 --> 52:01.960]  and it's good for testing and stuff.
[52:01.960 --> 52:04.200]  But I spent a week using it on my 5S
[52:04.200 --> 52:07.160]  before I took the plunge with my iPhone 6.
[52:08.360 --> 52:10.580]  And I really, really liked it.
[52:10.580 --> 52:12.880]  Really, really, I love the size.
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.640]  And I know that the screen is smaller
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.480]  and I'm rocketing towards needing reading glasses.
[52:20.760 --> 52:22.360]  So I appreciate the bigger screen size.
[52:22.360 --> 52:25.800]  But just as something to carry around, I would do it.
[52:26.660 --> 52:29.280]  But the big but is here's how I think
[52:29.280 --> 52:30.480]  they're gonna do the phones this year.
[52:30.480 --> 52:32.840]  And I don't even think it's that hard to predict.
[52:32.840 --> 52:35.800]  I think they'll come out with an iPhone 6S
[52:35.800 --> 52:38.600]  and an iPhone 6S Plus.
[52:38.600 --> 52:41.400]  And they will be exactly at the prices
[52:41.400 --> 52:45.240]  of the current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
[52:45.240 --> 52:49.040]  And it'll have a new A9 system on a chip
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.580]  instead of the A8 and it'll have a new camera in both.
[52:54.400 --> 52:56.880]  And I guess when people say the rumor
[52:56.880 --> 53:01.880]  is that there's gonna be a rose gold option,
[53:02.220 --> 53:03.860]  that makes sense to me.
[53:03.860 --> 53:07.840]  Just like when they first went to the iPhone 5S
[53:07.840 --> 53:09.640]  was when they added the gold.
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.200]  Just so there's something that looks like.
[53:11.200 --> 53:14.440]  Some different cosmetic change.
[53:14.440 --> 53:17.640]  That you can tell at a glance this is the new one.
[53:17.640 --> 53:19.560]  Who knows, maybe they'll even anodize
[53:19.560 --> 53:22.080]  the aluminum differently, go from space gray
[53:22.080 --> 53:25.040]  to space black or something like that on the black one.
[53:25.040 --> 53:27.740]  But just a color difference or something like that.
[53:29.240 --> 53:32.600]  Then I think one tier down they will have
[53:32.600 --> 53:36.000]  a new phone called the iPhone 6C.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.400]  Which would be, I think, four inches.
[53:40.480 --> 53:43.760]  Possibly all new colors compared to the 5C.
[53:43.760 --> 53:44.600]  I would think so.
[53:44.600 --> 53:46.520]  Well, probably the iPod colors.
[53:46.520 --> 53:48.160]  That's, yeah, exactly.
[53:48.160 --> 53:50.940]  Like instead of that sort of pastel-y palette,
[53:50.940 --> 53:53.440]  maybe more of like a bolder colors.
[53:53.440 --> 53:56.840]  Like the new iPods, yeah, exactly.
[53:56.840 --> 54:00.080]  Which is, I mean, and they come in silver and gold too.
[54:00.080 --> 54:02.040]  Yeah, well, but I don't think they would do that
[54:02.040 --> 54:02.880]  with plastic.
[54:02.880 --> 54:03.760]  You don't think they would do those with,
[54:03.760 --> 54:06.200]  oh yeah, because the iPods are not plastic.
[54:06.200 --> 54:07.360]  No, they're aluminum.
[54:07.360 --> 54:08.380]  Yeah, right.
[54:08.380 --> 54:10.840]  But I think colors like those colors.
[54:10.840 --> 54:14.400]  But I think it'll be the same type of plasticky case
[54:14.400 --> 54:17.940]  that the 5C has, just with new colors.
[54:17.940 --> 54:22.940]  A8, the camera from the iPhone 6.
[54:25.180 --> 54:26.680]  And because the case is thicker,
[54:26.680 --> 54:28.800]  it won't have the little nubbin sticking out.
[54:28.800 --> 54:30.020]  It'll sit flush.
[54:30.940 --> 54:34.740]  It'll be just like an iPhone 6 except a four inch screen
[54:34.740 --> 54:37.180]  and a plastic exterior.
[54:37.180 --> 54:39.560]  Which is a great phone, and I'd be very tempted by it.
[54:39.560 --> 54:43.940]  But I suspect I'll be an idiot and buy the bigger one
[54:43.940 --> 54:46.180]  because I want the camera, really.
[54:46.180 --> 54:48.580]  Even more than the faster system on a chip
[54:48.580 --> 54:50.760]  is I want the best camera possible.
[54:52.420 --> 54:53.580]  I think I might get it.
[54:54.440 --> 54:55.780]  I would be very tempted though.
[54:55.780 --> 55:00.060]  Yeah, I think I really just prefer that size.
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.520]  And I held one of those, a friend had one, the 5C.
[55:08.940 --> 55:10.220]  You know, I'd held them before,
[55:10.220 --> 55:14.140]  but I held it again recently, and I really liked it.
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.220]  It just felt really good.
[55:15.220 --> 55:17.420]  I mean, the plastic, even the plastic felt,
[55:17.420 --> 55:22.060]  it's a nice plastic, and the seams are well put together.
[55:22.060 --> 55:23.300]  It's a nice little phone,
[55:23.300 --> 55:26.060]  so I actually think I'm gonna go.
[55:26.060 --> 55:26.980]  I'm gonna go down.
[55:27.960 --> 55:28.800]  Yeah, I could see it.
[55:28.800 --> 55:30.120]  What do you have right now?
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.460]  A 6.
[55:31.460 --> 55:33.780]  Yeah, so it'd be a new phone.
[55:33.780 --> 55:37.860]  It's the same phone, just a smaller size in plastic.
[55:40.340 --> 55:42.180]  As long as I can get, because I have a 64,
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.120]  so that would be, I guess that would be a question,
[55:44.120 --> 55:46.020]  is if I could get a 64.
[55:46.020 --> 55:47.660]  Ooh, yeah, I wonder.
[55:49.800 --> 55:52.300]  Because I don't, well, actually, no, I think the.
[55:54.700 --> 55:56.540]  What do they sell now with the iPhone 5S?
[55:56.540 --> 55:58.600]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[55:58.600 --> 55:59.440]  16 and 32.
[55:59.440 --> 56:00.660]  16 and 32, right?
[56:00.660 --> 56:04.020]  Yeah, so what you need is you need Apple to up the minimum.
[56:04.020 --> 56:06.040]  Right, they would have to update the.
[56:06.040 --> 56:09.220]  If they go 32, 64, 128,
[56:09.220 --> 56:13.020]  then the two tiers for the mid-tier one would be 32 and 64.
[56:13.020 --> 56:14.740]  Yeah.
[56:14.740 --> 56:16.580]  I could see.
[56:16.580 --> 56:18.560]  Yeah, I could see them doing it, I really could.
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.820]  And then I think the, I guess,
[56:22.820 --> 56:27.120]  the 5S moves down to become the.
[56:27.120 --> 56:28.320]  That's weird, though.
[56:28.320 --> 56:30.100]  The free phone.
[56:30.100 --> 56:31.500]  That's a little weird.
[56:31.500 --> 56:34.660]  That's where, maybe they keep the 5C around,
[56:34.660 --> 56:36.700]  you know, and they have the 5C and the 6C.
[56:38.140 --> 56:39.620]  It is a little weird.
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.660]  That's the bottom part, yeah,
[56:40.660 --> 56:43.700]  the bottom part is what's confusing to me.
[56:43.700 --> 56:45.380]  What do they do down there?
[56:45.380 --> 56:47.840]  Because they have to have a free phone.
[56:47.840 --> 56:50.260]  Right, and I guess the reason it seems a little weird
[56:50.260 --> 56:54.460]  to have the 5S be the free one is without turning it on
[56:54.460 --> 56:56.300]  and without knowing what the specs are
[56:56.300 --> 56:58.380]  of the system on a chip or the camera,
[56:58.380 --> 57:00.740]  it just looks like it's the more premium device
[57:00.740 --> 57:03.860]  compared to the plastic 5C.
[57:03.860 --> 57:04.700]  Right.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.520]  So I don't know.
[57:05.520 --> 57:07.380]  Doesn't it seem like they could just do a 5S,
[57:07.380 --> 57:09.960]  I mean, 5S internals in plastic?
[57:09.960 --> 57:11.360]  Yeah, but what would they call it?
[57:11.360 --> 57:12.680]  They already have a 5C.
[57:13.660 --> 57:14.960]  5CS? 5CS.
[57:14.960 --> 57:15.800]  5CS.
[57:17.400 --> 57:18.240]  This is,
[57:19.660 --> 57:20.500]  this is,
[57:22.060 --> 57:25.000]  the Apple circa 1993 would have been done.
[57:26.620 --> 57:27.460]  Yeah, right.
[57:27.460 --> 57:28.460]  The Performa.
[57:28.460 --> 57:30.860]  The Performa, the iPhone Performa.
[57:30.860 --> 57:33.660]  The Performa 6400CD.
[57:34.580 --> 57:35.900]  Well, of course it's called the CD.
[57:35.900 --> 57:37.660]  It has a compact disc player.
[57:37.660 --> 57:40.780]  That's the one I have.
[57:40.780 --> 57:43.940]  The Performa 640i CD.
[57:46.420 --> 57:47.380]  It has a Wi-Fi.
[57:47.380 --> 57:49.380]  Of course we have to put an I in there.
[57:53.980 --> 57:55.300]  What do you, say, what do you think?
[57:55.300 --> 57:57.620]  Do you think you think you're gonna go smaller?
[57:57.620 --> 57:58.460]  I miss it.
[57:58.460 --> 58:00.060]  Well, if I can get 64, I think I will.
[58:00.060 --> 58:02.180]  If what we're describing is what it is,
[58:02.180 --> 58:06.000]  if it's basically iPhone 6 internals in a plastic case
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.100]  and the cases are not the current ones,
[58:10.100 --> 58:11.460]  the colors are not the current ones,
[58:11.460 --> 58:14.740]  they're the more like the current iPod ones
[58:14.740 --> 58:16.020]  than the current 5C,
[58:17.420 --> 58:20.440]  and I can get 64 gigs, I will probably go with the,
[58:22.000 --> 58:22.840]  what are we calling it?
[58:22.840 --> 58:24.460]  6S, 6C.
[58:24.460 --> 58:26.380]  6C, I think it'll be called the 6C.
[58:27.380 --> 58:30.260]  And I totally, I do, and having spent a week with it
[58:30.260 --> 58:32.660]  just now, and I've never done that before,
[58:32.660 --> 58:35.620]  like usually by nine months into the iPhone cycle,
[58:35.620 --> 58:36.980]  I can't go back to the old one,
[58:36.980 --> 58:38.320]  because it feels too slow.
[58:40.500 --> 58:43.380]  But the 5S, to me, totally holds up,
[58:43.380 --> 58:47.000]  and it feels a little bit slower than the 6, but not much.
[58:48.380 --> 58:49.620]  It's like a really good phone.
[58:49.620 --> 58:52.780]  The 5S is, to me, like probably the best phone
[58:52.780 --> 58:53.620]  they've ever made.
[58:53.620 --> 58:56.440]  Like it's held up past its prime
[58:56.440 --> 58:58.180]  better than any previous phone.
[58:58.180 --> 58:59.900]  And I miss that form factor.
[58:59.900 --> 59:02.020]  Right, and that phone, to me,
[59:02.020 --> 59:06.820]  was the pinnacle of iPhone technology.
[59:06.820 --> 59:09.180]  Yeah, just the way that the sides are flat
[59:09.180 --> 59:10.860]  and the size of it, it feels to me like
[59:10.860 --> 59:12.820]  I couldn't drop it if I wanted to.
[59:12.820 --> 59:14.840]  Like it just feels like undroppable,
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.540]  whereas the 6 just still feels like, you know, it's-
[59:19.540 --> 59:21.220]  It's a little, it's slippery.
[59:21.220 --> 59:23.060]  It's a bar of soap every time you take it out.
[59:23.060 --> 59:23.880]  Yeah.
[59:26.300 --> 59:28.380]  Well, they don't listen to us, so.
[59:28.380 --> 59:29.220]  Nope, never.
[59:29.220 --> 59:32.060]  No, they don't listen to you, but they don't listen to me.
[59:35.060 --> 59:38.940]  Let me do another sponsor, and it is our good friends.
[59:38.940 --> 59:40.460]  This, it is a coincidence.
[59:40.460 --> 59:42.500]  I don't set these sponsor schedules,
[59:42.500 --> 59:45.140]  but to me, it's the happy sort of coincidence
[59:45.140 --> 59:48.100]  that works out, you know.
[59:48.100 --> 59:50.180]  It just shows that we're living life, right, John?
[59:50.180 --> 59:53.860]  It's our friends at Hullo, H-U-L-L-O.
[59:53.860 --> 59:54.900]  They make, you know what they make?
[59:54.900 --> 59:56.820]  They make pillows.
[59:56.820 --> 59:57.820]  You've never tried it?
[59:57.820 --> 59:59.940]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat hull pillow?
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.660]  A buckwheat hull pillow.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.740]  It's been popular.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.020]  I may have.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.980]  It's popular.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.640]  It's been popular for centuries throughout Asia.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.740]  Yeah, yeah, so as a matter of fact, I have.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.300]  It's, you know, in very broad terms,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.540]  it is like, sort of like a beanbag pillow,
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.940]  but they're not, it's not beans.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.840]  It's buckwheat hulls.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.180]  Sounds crazy.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.340]  I know when I first heard about it,
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.960]  I thought, well, that sounds stupid, but it's not.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.800]  You get it.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.620]  It's also very heavy.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.460]  It's very heavy.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.460]  It's a pillow stuffed with these buckwheat hulls.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.460]  You know, you shake it.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.380]  It shakes like a beanbag.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.620]  Here's the thing.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.220]  It is, it makes it much more adjustable.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.900]  The pillow conforms perfectly to the shape of your head
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.980]  and your neck, and it really works
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.820]  no matter how you sleep.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.300]  Do you sleep flat on your back?
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.180]  Are you on your belly?
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.020]  Are you on your side?
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.960]  Doesn't matter.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.900]  The pillow, you know, just puff it up a little bit,
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.740]  and it fits perfectly.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.060]  Air, here's the big difference,
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.720]  one of the big differences, and I've noticed this.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.960]  The air flows freely through the buckwheat hulls fill.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.300]  The fill keeps it cool all night long.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.960]  Like, the pillow doesn't get hot
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.220]  because of your hot, sweaty, disgusting head,
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.180]  like a traditional Western-style pillow.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.320]  How do you adjust the thickness?
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.480]  What if it's, what if you think that the pillow,
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.780]  as it comes out of the box, is too thick?
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.620]  Easy.
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:28.020]  All you do, they just unzip it.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.460]  There's a cover, you take the cover off, you unzip it,
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.300]  and you just take some of the buckwheat hulls out,
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.620]  and then you have a thinner pillow.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.980]  Just take them out.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.100]  It couldn't be easier.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:41.020]  Here's another product that is made in the USA
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.260]  with quality construction, quality materials.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.320]  It's really, really nice.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.800]  Pre-shrunken and durable twill cotton case,
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.360]  a high-quality hidden zipper from Dunlap,
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720]  and the buckwheat hulls are grown and milled
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.740]  in North Dakota, good old USA.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.840]  It's a very environmentally-friendly and organic product.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.200]  There's no chemicals, no foams, no bird feathers,
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.200]  100% unbleached certified organic cotton on the outside,
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.180]  and it's the same type thing.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.260]  You get a deal of 60 days, buy this pillow,
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.440]  you got 60 nights, and if you're not satisfied,
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.980]  they'll give you a full refund, no questions asked.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.620]  They'll just take it right back.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.820]  Free shipping, fast, free shipping in the contiguous US,
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.620]  so you gotta be in the lower 48.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.780]  Sorry, Alaska, sorry, Hawaii,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:41.600]  and sorry to my listeners in Europe,
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.740]  but if you're in the 48 lower US states,
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.960]  free shipping, there you go.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.580]  So here's the prices, small size, 49 bucks.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.820]  You can save five bucks on each additional one you get.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:59.660]  Standard is 79, and then the king size pillow is 129.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.500]  Here's where you go.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.500]  You go to HulloPillow, H-U-L-L-O P-I-L-L-O-W,
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.500]  H-U-L-L-O, pillow.com, slash talk show,
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.940]  no the, just slash talk show,
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.600]  and 1% of all of their profits
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.460]  are contributed to The Nature Conservancy.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.580]  So you can, thanks to this show alone,
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.200]  you can totally redo the way you sleep.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.040]  Get a new mattress, get a new pillow.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.480]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.700]  And you go to that URL and it says, welcome daring fireballers.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:38.920]  There you go.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.760]  See that?
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.640]  There you go.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.080]  You're already buying a pillow.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.560]  I'm really considering it.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.960]  I used one in Japan, slept fine.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.260]  Yeah, it sounded crazy to me.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:56.060]  Apparently, again, I know it's part of the material
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.460]  they gave me, but from what I've gathered,
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.480]  it actually is very common in Asia.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.880]  Yeah, and that's the, I mean, the one thing
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.200]  that it does really well is like support your,
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.440]  like if you have got neck support problems,
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.960]  this is probably a really good solution
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.340]  because that, and that's what I spend,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.420]  I spend most of my day configuring my pillow
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.460]  for neck support for before I go to bed,
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.680]  because I'm old.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.160]  So something like this helps a lot.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.600]  I know it's one of those things where, you know,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.000]  let's face it, 100 years from now,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.800]  we're gonna look back at us,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.640]  and everybody's probably gonna be a vegetarian, you know?
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.920]  All the stuff we're doing.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.260]  Savages.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.720]  Well, I would just.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.960]  Or that like that grown, that meat grown in a lab.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.560]  Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for.
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.400]  I hope by the time I'm an old man,
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.720]  hopefully we'll be able to switch to that.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.960]  Because I was gonna say, isn't it,
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.080]  it is kind of disgusting to think about the fact
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.480]  that a lot of us have slept a lot of time
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.000]  in a sack full of plucked bird feathers.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.840]  Like if you don't call it a pillow
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.060]  and you just call it a sack full of plucked feathers.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.080]  It's.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.160]  It's a little weird.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.020]  Well, we're laughing because it's weird and gross,
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.880]  but if you step, you know, take a deep breath
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.160]  and think about it, it seems a little inhumane,
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.220]  I have to say.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.060]  And which I realize is.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.580]  Yeah, it's like there's like a naked goose
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.080]  walking around someplace.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.360]  Right, which is, you know.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.600]  This is cruel.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.760]  I know, which is a little bit, you know,
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.600]  hypocritical from someone who eats two or three
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.460]  steaks a week.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:31.460]  Like, I realize that somewhere there's a cow
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.060]  about to be slaughtered to be turned into a steak
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.660]  who is like, hey, if you wanna pluck my hair out.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.940]  I'd much prefer.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.280]  Right, well, let's make a deal.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.180]  Did you see that, the thing with that El Chapo guy
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.340]  down in Mexico?
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.300]  No.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.460]  You didn't see this, the drug guy who broke out of prison?
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.380]  Oh, I saw an oblique reference to that,
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.460]  so you fill me in on that.
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.980]  So, I forget his real name, but everybody just calls him
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.220]  El Chapo, he's a Mexican drug lord kingpin,
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.580]  sort of a, who was the guy who was the head
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.780]  of the Medellin Cartel back in the 80s,
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.500]  was real famous.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.780]  You know, he's a guy who's like hundreds and hundreds
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.020]  of millions of dollars in drug profits.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.660]  And, you know, a couple years ago, they caught him
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.900]  and they locked him up and he busted out of prison.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.020]  And he went on the lam.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:30.580]  And then, you know, the US got involved
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:34.180]  and last year they caught him again.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.860]  And apparently with, you know, what they said was,
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.860]  it's kind of an interesting story, Rita,
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.700]  is that the official story was that it was
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.300]  with some intelligence from the United States
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.780]  and then the Mexican, you know, their equivalent
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:50.460]  of the FBI busted the guy at like, what?
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.180]  A resort hotel somewhere in Mexico.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.060]  You know, like life on the lam was apparently
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.340]  really tough for this guy.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.900]  But there's reports now from other people
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.900]  that it wasn't even the Mexican special police,
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.900]  it was USDA agents wearing the Mexican
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.060]  and federal police uniforms just for the optics,
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.500]  you know, that they, you know, that it didn't look,
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.380]  it doesn't look good to people in Mexico
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.180]  if US, you know, law enforcement agents
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.620]  are running around Mexico.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.700]  But they arrested the guy and the US said,
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.740]  let us take this guy, extradite him,
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.860]  let us charge him in the US.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.260]  Come on, the guy busted out.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.020]  And as they were arresting him and they, you know,
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.740]  arraigned him, whatever they call it,
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.580]  the guy swore, he stood up and he said,
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.340]  you know, I'm gonna bust out again.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.580]  And the Mexican government said, no, you're not,
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.100]  not this time, we're putting you in a supermax prison,
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.100]  you know, it's unbreakable.
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:59.100]  And the other guy broke out again.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.140]  He broke, he busted right out.
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.340]  My joke was that they run the place like Arkham Asylum.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:05.900]  You're right.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.300]  But there's video in his room.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.060]  He was never in there in the first place.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.700]  So the story that they said the day after he broke out
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:15.300]  is that they, somebody, you know, sympathetic to his cause,
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.460]  some of the guys from his, you know, his cartel,
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.900]  they started making a building.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.820]  There was a building that was put up like a cinder block
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.140]  type, you know, very, very simple structure
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.220]  about a mile outside the prison.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.820]  And then inside this building, they dug a hole
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.340]  and they started digging,
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.740]  they dug a tunnel underneath the prison right into his cell.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.420]  And then they cut like a little 20 inch by 20 inch
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.180]  square hole in the shower.
[01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.860]  In the shower, that's what, yeah.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.060]  In his cell.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.500]  And so there's video footage.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.500]  His cell was under 24 hour, seven day a week surveillance,
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.340]  video surveillance.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.260]  So they have the footage.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.380]  He just, he's in there pacing for a couple of minutes.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.740]  And then he walks over to his bed
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.260]  and puts on a pair of shoes and he walks into the shower
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.780]  and he just disappears.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.300]  He just goes down all.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.740]  And apparently they're really good.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.140]  His cartel is sort of, has, you know,
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.380]  like mining level expertise digging these tunnels
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:14.780]  because apparently that's how they get
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.100]  a lot of the drugs into the United States,
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.660]  that they've got like a network of tunnels like this.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.620]  But you know, but it's a mile
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.140]  and a little, you know, hand dug tunnel.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.860]  But they had like a little track down there.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:31.700]  It's pretty cool.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.540]  They have pictures of it.
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.380]  You know, they've shown the media.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.660]  They rigged up like a dirt bike,
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.740]  like a little motorcycle onto a track.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.140]  So he didn't have to crawl the whole way.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:43.920]  And they had like lights down there too, you know.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.540]  But then he could just get on this little bike
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.780]  that's on a track and then it would,
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.700]  it just scooted him right out to this building
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:50.960]  and now he's gone.
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:54.900]  Yeah, lighted.
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.460]  It says lighted and ventilated tunnel nearly a mile long.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.580]  Yeah.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:03.620]  But now there's some controversy about it though
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.980]  because apparently they have not let anybody
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.040]  from the media, they've let people from the media
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.460]  down into the tunnel and they've let people into his cell
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.580]  and look at the hole that was dug
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.260]  and shine like a flashlight down there.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.300]  But nobody has verified that the tunnel
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.780]  goes all the way from this building right into his cell.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.780]  And there's the, so the conspiracy theory
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.580]  is that he didn't even have to do that.
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.620]  That part was faked so there'd be like
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.820]  some kind of cover story, but that.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.080]  For him getting out?
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.340]  But yeah, but that the corruption is so bad.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.900]  Oh, so somebody like just waltzed them out the front door?
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.860]  Yeah, that, you know, somebody, you know, decided,
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.700]  you know, and there's a couple of people who work
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.340]  in the prison who've been arrested already
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.500]  for, you know, not doing their jobs.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.820]  But that maybe they took it, you know,
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.100]  maybe he cut them a deal where it's like, you know,
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.020]  I'll send your family so much money, you know,
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.700]  you'll do a couple years, you know,
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.180]  you'll do five years or whatever,
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.620]  but I'll make it worth your while.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.840]  And they did, you know, and then they made this fake tunnel
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.380]  just to have a cover story.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.660]  I don't know.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:03.500]  Either way though.
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.660]  I know, I like the, I like the previous.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.260]  I like to think that they made the whole tunnel.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.900]  Yeah, I do too.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.140]  That's just, that's much more, that's much more romantic.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.500]  The other one is just disappointing.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.180]  That it's just simple corruption.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.620]  I don't mean to laugh.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:28.940]  I mean, it's, you know.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:31.220]  Yeah, it's not great that he's out, but.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.060]  Right.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.660]  I mean, you know, they didn't kill anybody on the way out,
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:37.500]  but he'll probably kill somebody.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.340]  Oh, and the other thing, this is the other part
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:45.340]  that makes it so amusing, is that he got into a,
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.940]  or either he or somebody with his official Twitter account
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.960]  got into a bit of a ruckus with Donald Trump.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780]  Have you heard this?
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.660]  What was I, asleep all week?
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.260]  Yeah, so I guess he busted out and Donald Trump,
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.460]  this fit right into Donald Trump's narrative
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:10.140]  that Mexico is not to be trusted
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.900]  and that there's sort of a criminal element
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:15.260]  running wild down there or whatever.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.180]  I don't know, Donald Trump shot his mouth off
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.660]  that if he were president,
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.340]  nobody would be breaking out of Mexico.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.340]  I did see that, I didn't understand it.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.840]  I didn't because I didn't know who El Chapo was.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.840]  But then after he shot his mouth off,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.240]  there was something like an unofficial Twitter account
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.840]  for El Chapo that tweeted at Donald Trump
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.380]  that he better shut his mouth and watch his back.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.520]  El Chapo's media intern fired back angrily.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.520]  That's gonna look interesting on a resume.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.640]  I was the social media manager for El Chapo.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.200]  I just like the idea that the guy busted out
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.000]  of a second, the most secure prison in all of Mexico
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.520]  for the second time with all this publicity
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.480]  and then he gets on Twitter and starts getting upset
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.680]  that Donald Trump is talking bad about him.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.640]  So anyway, if anybody out there is listening
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.300]  from El Chapo's crew.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.600]  We're highly respectful.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:38.760]  We are and hats off to you for escaping.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.600]  No insult implied.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.460]  We don't need any trouble.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.080]  El Chapo put, what does it say here?
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.760]  I just Googled this.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.400]  El Chapo puts $100 million bounty for Donald Trump dead.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.520]  Wow, that's from TMC.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.360]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.860]  Oh, yeah, only if it comes straight
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.680]  from El Chapo's Twitter account.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.880]  Can you trust it?
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.120]  I wonder if he has the check mark.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:16.120]  Yeah, verified El Chapo.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.840]  All right, what else is going on?
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.920]  Bit of follow up, bit of follow up with Jason Snell
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.880]  on the previous episode.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:34.640]  We had talked about the new Pebble Time smartwatch
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.480]  and I complained about my two big complaints
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.540]  about the one that I bought were that the screen,
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.000]  it was very, very low contrast.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.520]  I couldn't read it and the fonts are too small
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.520]  and that the vibration alert is way too strong and powerful.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.560]  So they came out, in the meantime,
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.980]  I guess they did listen to my show,
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:58.400]  they put out a software update
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.320]  that gives you a little bit of control over the screen
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.840]  and over the taptic response.
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.440]  And so I got some email from people who were like,
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.640]  holy cow, you just complained about this, they fixed it.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.040]  It doesn't really fix either of them, in my opinion.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.720]  The taptic thing may be a little bit,
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.080]  but it still is, taptic thing,
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.120]  it seems to me, I installed the update.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.680]  It does seem like turning that down
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.620]  lessens the feeling like I'm getting an electric shock
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.240]  when it vibrates on my wrist, but it's still loud.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.360]  I still can hear it.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.660]  And the brightness thing doesn't solve
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.120]  any of the problems at all,
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.200]  because the brightness is only when the backlight is on
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.320]  and it is brighter and that can help a little bit,
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.160]  but it doesn't help the contrast at all.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.560]  And it doesn't help at all with the lack of contrast
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.360]  when the backlight isn't on at all.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.440]  So I still have to give a thumbs down to the Pebble time.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  Pebble time. I'm assuming that the Pebble is in the,
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.160]  smartwatch market share numbers that came out.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.040]  I guess so, yeah, that's part of the news from this week,
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.320]  where the smartwatch.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.440]  It doesn't say specifically,
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.720]  it just says Apple, Samsung, and others.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.400]  And Pebble's, well, I don't know,
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.040]  I would think Pebble would be bigger than Samsung,
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.600]  but I really have no idea.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.600]  Yeah, I don't know about that.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.840]  Samsung might be ahead of Pebble,
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.680]  but Pebble's got it ranked somewhere on there.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:34.040]  I mean, they've sold, you know.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:37.240]  They only have three, Apple, Samsung, and others.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.280]  So this is strategy analytics.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.400]  Saying that Apple Watch captures 75% global
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.640]  smartwatch market share in Q2 2015.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.680]  Which doesn't, I mean, you know,
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.600]  that doesn't seem terribly surprising.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.280]  Even though nobody really knows how many they shipped.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.960]  No, nobody knows.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.800]  So.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.520]  So there.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.560]  But on the other hand-
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.440]  Thank you, no, you're wrong.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.260]  On the other hand,
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:11.800]  nobody knows how many Samsung has ever shipped,
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.720]  because Samsung stopped reporting all those numbers
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.200]  for everything, not just for watches,
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.800]  but for smartphones and stuff too, a while ago.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.240]  So, you know.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.080]  Yeah, and I was talking about this with Dan
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.080]  and Guy on our show, and,
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.080]  I just, we weren't, why does Apple,
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.120]  why is Apple the one that seems to report
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.920]  all this stuff and nobody else does?
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.440]  Yeah, it's always a little funny to me that Apple,
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.320]  which has long had the reputation
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]  as being the most secretive of companies,
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.960]  is the one that, you know, reveals the most about its sales
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960]  and stuff like that.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.560]  And now that they're not,
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.000]  they're still being held to a different standard.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.840]  Amazon doesn't even know how to put,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.520]  put a label on it in Access.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.280]  I like that people like-
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.520]  Will only report numbers.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.360]  Snell, when he was tweeting,
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.480]  or posting some of the results, you know,
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.560]  from all the companies that posted stuff,
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.960]  you know, in the last week or two,
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.840]  because in the interim, Apple has reported
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.840]  its quarterly results and a couple other companies did too.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.520]  He calls them Amazon charts.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.800]  So among the many charts he made
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.360]  for Apple's quarterly results is he made one
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.640]  for Apple Watch sales and it just has a bunch of quarters
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.480]  with nothing.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.440]  The line, the line going up.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.160]  Then a line going up and with no access.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.760]  Q3, up.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.160]  Sales are up from since before it went on sale.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.360]  Yeah, the first quarter was really the best, right?
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.960]  They just shoot straight up.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.080]  I mean, they're still.
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.680]  So what, I haven't really been paying attention.
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.400]  What has happened to Apple's stock price since then?
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.400]  I know overnight when they first released their results,
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.960]  their stock dropped something like 6% overnight.
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.240]  Yeah, it looks like it's still down.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.400]  Although it seems like it's returned a little bit.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.920]  Down from when though?
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.120]  Well, from before they reported the results.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:27.880]  Yeah.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.440]  So it's at 122 now.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.080]  Yeah, before they announced their results,
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.840]  it was up around like 130ish, 132.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.040]  It's still way up for the year.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.880]  Yeah.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.080]  But it's been sort of flat since about February.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.000]  I mean, going up and down,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.480]  but not really getting out of that same range.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.960]  Yeah.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.840]  Which, again, what am I?
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.760]  Am I a financial expert?
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.680]  But it seems to make sense to me
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.160]  that a large, very large, and predictable company
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.880]  should have a relatively stable stock.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.440]  Like, I don't know.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.040]  To me, it has been.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.480]  And I can laugh because I don't have my money in Apple.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880]  And I worry sometimes.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.920]  I was thinking about it the other day
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.320]  that I crack jokes about the volatility
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.680]  of Apple's stock price.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.400]  And it occurred to me that there's probably
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.440]  an awful lot of people who read Daring Fireball
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.760]  and listen to this show who it's not very funny at all.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.600]  Not very funny.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.600]  And again, and I don't think it's the knee-jerk,
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.160]  oh, well, they're fans of Apple,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.400]  so they put their money in Apple.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.520]  I think it's probably because they're smart people
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.040]  and it's been a very good buy for a long time.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.080]  And I think that a reasonable person
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.640]  could reasonably expect that their future remains bright.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.720]  So this has nothing to do with investing in a company
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.560]  because you're a fan.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.400]  I think it's smart.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.160]  And I think that when they reveal
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.080]  record-breaking quarterly results
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.200]  and the market cap drops $50 billion in after-hours trading,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.040]  it's not very funny at all.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.360]  Why are we laughing?
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.200]  I don't know.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.640]  I do think, in all seriousness, though,
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.800]  I think, and again, I'm not an expert.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.160]  I know that one of the strategic differences
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.480]  the company has made in this Tim Cook era
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.080]  from the Steve Jobs era is that they've gotten involved
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.480]  in the stock buybacks and the,
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.680]  what do you call it when they give money back
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.560]  to the shareholders?
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.400]  Dividends.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.040]  The dividends, I don't know, maybe not so much,
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.320]  but with the stock buybacks,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.720]  that it actually, it's a way to mitigate that
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.920]  because presumably, if Apple's smart,
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.960]  they waited until after they announced these results
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.160]  to do more of the stock.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.280]  Right, that if they are smart enough to foresee
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.600]  that the fact that there's so many people
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.880]  whose expectations were so high,
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.920]  that this was considered disappointing
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.600]  even though it broke records.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.080]  Well, I guess that's the nice thing
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.360]  about being an Apple investor currently
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.840]  is that even if the stock is flat,
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:24.360]  there are other things that make it an attractive buy.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.520]  Right, right.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.560]  You know, just sit there and hold it
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.600]  and you're gonna make more money
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.560]  than you would compared to interest rates.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.920]  Right, or spending it like I do.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.920]  But the five, I mean, look at the five-year.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.720]  It's pretty good.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.240]  It's got, you know, there was a big,
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.120]  there was kind of a run-up in 2012
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.620]  and then it came back down towards the end.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.820]  But since then, it's been climbing fairly steadily.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:02.160]  Yeah, if you smooth out 2012 to 2013,
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.120]  it still goes up, you know, but it's, you know,
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.000]  in the long run, it looks like clearly an anomaly.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.380]  Yeah.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:12.220]  Yeah, boy, if you look at the.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.800]  I mean, it seems like we got over the fear
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:19.720]  that Tim Cook was not, you know, not the man for the job.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:24.720]  Well, it's, but the run-up was under Tim Cook too
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.400]  because Jobs died at the end of 2011.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.240]  Yeah.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.380]  I think there was sort of, I think there was sort of a,
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.700]  I think there was a mania in 2012 where there was,
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:38.400]  holy shit, they didn't just shut the doors, right?
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.000]  They didn't just shut the doors.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.440]  It seems like the company is still, you know,
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.440]  employees are still showing up for work.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.720]  The lights are still on in Cupertino.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.720]  So there was like a mania and they ran it up
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.020]  and then there was the second half of the year,
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.320]  which is, boy, I had some of the best claim chowder
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:02.320]  of all time where the Apple board should fire Tim Cook.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.440]  Why is it taking so long for the Apple board
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.640]  to fire Tim Cook?
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.800]  Those are good times.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.800]  Good times.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.880]  I bet, again, I bet that was a great time to be Tim Cook.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.400]  Not that he was worried.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.240]  I'm sure he wasn't worried.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.560]  No, no, not at all.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.240]  I thought it was funny.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.380]  You know, Al Gore's on line two.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.380]  Tim, I've been reading it.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.360]  It sounds, I guess that's a little bit more
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.180]  like a Bill Clinton.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.320]  That's a little bit, but still pretty good.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.560]  Bill Clinton's on line three.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.000]  Bill Clinton's great for some reason,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.720]  Bill Clinton's on line three.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.560]  I've been reading Business Insider.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:47.560]  Ha, ha, ha Tim, I've been reading it.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.800]  Forbes.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.000]  Some bad Forbes says you shouldn't be seeing it anymore.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:57.840]  Is that true?
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:00.920]  Forbes contributor.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.100]  So the stock is doing well.
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.600]  The company is doing well.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.040]  They have a lot of money
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.000]  and we still have five gigabytes of iCloud storage.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, and eight gigabyte iPhone 5Cs.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.840]  All right, let me do another sponsor break.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.040]  And I'll roll this in,
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.680]  because actually it's a good segue.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.600]  Remind me I want to talk to you
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.720]  about the new Steve Jobs movie.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.960]  But our next sponsor is our good friends at Fracture.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:36.920]  You guys know Fracture.
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.000]  They are the company.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.240]  You send them, you sign up.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.080]  We don't even sign up.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.920]  We just go there.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:41.960]  You send them your photos.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.320]  Pick a favorite photo of yours.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:45.520]  Give it to them.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.380]  Pick a size.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.260]  They print it directly on pure glass.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.880]  Your photo right on the glass.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.200]  They package it up.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:54.040]  Comes right to you.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.900]  And in the package is everything you need.
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.000]  It's got a foam back.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.420]  You can just, if it's big,
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.720]  it's got everything you need to mount it on the wall.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.040]  They give you the screws you need
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.440]  for mounting it on a wall.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.160]  You want to prop it up on your mantle
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.560]  or on your desk or something like that.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.000]  They've got everything you need for that.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.360]  It's amazing packaging.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.680]  Amazing print quality.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:15.520]  But here's the thing.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.760]  It breaks you out of having everything digital
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.600]  and looking at your photos of your family,
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.940]  everything, places you've gone, stuff like that.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.700]  It breaks you out of only experiencing these things
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:30.360]  on screens, right?
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.400]  Your Mac, your iPhone, something like that.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.720]  It brings them into the analog world.
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.480]  And there's an emotional aspect to that
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.280]  that it's just hard to explain.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.680]  I'm trying to do it right here, but it's hard.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.520]  But it really does mean something, to me at least.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.460]  And I know that in my house,
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.720]  we like having the pictures printed out
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.520]  and it really makes a difference.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:57.140]  And there's no better way to do it than fracture.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.540]  Give your photos, this is what they say,
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:03.020]  give your photos the analog beauty they deserve.
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:08.020]  And it's amazing to me, given how good the iPhone camera is,
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.000]  how big you can print a photo
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.600]  that you've taken with your phone
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.960]  and still have it look good
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.160]  when it's hanging on a wall printed out.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.240]  In the back of my mind,
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:23.240]  I still think phone photo equals 640 by 480.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.720]  Don't print it very big
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:26.240]  or you're gonna see the pixels or whatever.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.240]  It's amazing what photos from an iPhone 5S or 6,
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:35.000]  what they can look like when you print them real big.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.760]  And Fracture does a great job of it.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.540]  So here's where you go.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.940]  Go to their website, fractureme.com.
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:47.200]  And the code for this show is daringfireball, all one word.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.960]  And if it's your first order,
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.680]  you save 15% by using that code.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.640]  So go to fractureme.com
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.560]  and remember the code daringfireball, you'll save some bucks.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.440]  So go print a photo, print a photo.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.240]  Trust me, you're gonna appreciate it.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:05.480]  I said on the last show,
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.640]  they've sponsored the last show too.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.480]  They sent me a nice picture complimentary
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.680]  just as part of our friendship,
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.880]  them sponsoring the show
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.700]  and me saying good things about them.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:16.520]  They sent me a print of me and Phil Schiller on stage.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.360]  Got it right here.
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.360]  Right here in my office as I speak.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.200]  Is he talking about me?
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.240]  Yeah, he did.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.200]  He was cracking jokes.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.400]  I like molds.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.480]  That should have been the title of the episode.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.300]  I like molds.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]  It's on my resume now.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.600]  It's on my resume.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:42.280]  He was mad that I cracked a molds joke.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.440]  As well he should be.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.360]  You can say what you want about iCloud.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.560]  Say what you want about 16.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.780]  You can say what you want about 16 gigabyte phones,
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.880]  but you start cracking jokes about molds.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.040]  Schiller's at your door.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  So have you seen this?
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.280]  There's a new documentary coming out about Steve Jobs.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.420]  Oh, the documentary?
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:07.260]  Yeah, that one.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.040]  That's the one you want to talk about, not the other one.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.560]  And it seems to me like they are...
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.740]  I mean, I guess it was done.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:15.400]  I don't even know why.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.800]  The independent movie business seems so complicated to me
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.160]  because they screened it at South by Southwest this year,
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  which was March, Alex Gibney.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.860]  I've seen some of his movies.
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.280]  I saw his Scientology movie, Going Clear,
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.160]  Scientology and the Prison of Belief,
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:39.160]  which was really highly regarded.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.600]  And I find Scientology fascinating.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.960]  It's just such a weird, crazy thing.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:51.440]  Like it's a religion, like a religious cult for rich celebrities.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.160]  Well, you're going to get letters.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.000]  Well, I don't know.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.920]  Talk about people coming to your door.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.400]  Come to my door.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.880]  You know, I used to get a lot of Scientology paraphernalia.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.200]  Did I ever tell you that?
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.040]  No.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.440]  Well, when I was growing up,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.180]  I read a lot of science fiction, a lot of science fiction.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:15.840]  I consumed it vociferously.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.240]  Was that the word?
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.960]  I read as much of it voraciously.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.360]  I read as much of it as I could get.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.940]  And at some point, I read some of the books
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:27.900]  by L. Ron Hubbard.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120]  I forget the series.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:30.960]  I don't know.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.280]  It was one of the, some crazy shit that he wrote late.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.120]  Yeah, it's the one that they made the stupid triple.
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.440]  No, I read that one too.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.680]  There was Battlefield Earth, which was one novel.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.940]  And then there was another one,
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:43.000]  which was like a series of 10 novels.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.960]  And I didn't think it was good.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.040]  And it was weird.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.620]  It seemed, I swear to God, I'm not making this up.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:52.740]  I'm not making this up.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.040]  It seemed weird to me.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.000]  And I was like 10th or 11th grade.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.160]  And it seemed weird to me that the bad guys
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.680]  in this space opera, it was something about aliens.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:05.340]  And most people on Earth don't know the aliens are there.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.560]  And then there's a good guy who's protecting Earth.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.240]  And there's bad guys from another planet
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.040]  who are trying to take over the Earth
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.200]  or something like that.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.480]  And the bad guys are psychiatrists.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.580]  Yeah, well, I thought that was a little weird.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.120]  Until you look into Scientology
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.200]  and then it suddenly becomes.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:32.200]  Right, but I guess I like mail ordered the books
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:33.120]  or something like that.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.160]  Well, then I started getting Scientology stuff in the mail.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.340]  And I did not ask for that.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.080]  And I didn't even know it was the same guy.
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.360]  Because you remember in the 80s,
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.840]  there used to be commercials for the Dianetics all the time.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.760]  Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.680]  With the volcanoes exploding and stuff like that.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.620]  And they sent me stuff like that.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.680]  And my dad, it wasn't like an intervention,
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:58.520]  but my dad was like,
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.160]  how come all this stuff is coming for you?
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.040]  And I was like, oh, well, I read this guy's
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:05.400]  like Star Wars type book.
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.440]  And I guess they signed me up for this.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.080]  He goes, well, don't, my dad.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.720]  I guess I'm in a cult now, I guess.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.400]  My dad's advice was don't get into this shit.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.560]  He was right.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.400]  Yeah.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:25.600]  But anyway, Gibney made a documentary about Scientology
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.760]  that was well-regarded and I enjoyed it,
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.360]  but I didn't think, I enjoyed it
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.260]  because I'm interested in the subject,
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:36.840]  but I thought it was a sort of a weird documentary.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.240]  But now he's made one about Steve Jobs.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.600]  Right, and this is the one that the Apple executives
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.800]  have objected to.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.800]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:50.560]  80Q, I think, was the one who tweeted about
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.320]  how it was mean-spirited or something like that.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.160]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.540]  Not the man that he knew.
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:58.320]  Yeah, and I guess he saw it at South by Southwest.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.160]  Yeah, I think so. I don't know.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.220]  I guess, I hope he saw it.
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.520]  I hope he's not saying it without having seen it.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.360]  Right.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.800]  And the preview looks great.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:11.000]  I'll put the trailer in the show notes.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.560]  Here I am copying and pasting it right now
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.240]  so I don't forget.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.400]  I think I've been doing a good job just as a meta note.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.120]  I do think I've been doing a better job lately
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.100]  of actually putting in the show notes
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.560]  everything that I claim to put in the show notes.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.600]  The trailer looks interesting and it makes it look
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:32.600]  like it's a fair and balanced look at the guy's life.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.760]  But the poster, to me, is a little worrisome.
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.920]  Did you see, have you seen the poster?
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.320]  No, I have not.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.280]  Let me see if I can find a link to the poster.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.280]  The poster is sort of a weird.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.560]  So this is Steve Jobs, the man in the machine.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.440]  Yes.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.580]  Not to be confused with the other popular movie, Ex Machina.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:58.580]  Also, that's Steve Jobs, in which Steve Jobs builds a robot.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.160]  Oh, man, where's the poster for this movie?
[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.180]  I don't know.
[01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:06.140]  Gotta find the poster.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.460]  Is it in the, oh, wow.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.180]  The one that's just his face?
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.180]  Yeah, it's like a weird Photoshop job
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.100]  because that's not what he, yeah, they're, you know,
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:19.580]  it's, they've sort of, yeah, definitely.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.220]  Because you can find the original image for that
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:25.100]  and it's like they've made him look sinister.
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.420]  I don't know how else to say it,
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.900]  but they've sort of sinister.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.500]  Well, yeah, it's like it's all,
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.500]  they made the background black instead of, right?
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.340]  Yeah.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.060]  It looks like he's in the shade, the shadows,
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.900]  instead of just standing in a room.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:40.620]  And they kind of gave him, like, devil eyes.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.100]  You know what I mean?
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.540]  Like they've, there's like a Photoshop filter.
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:46.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.240]  The eyes do look different, don't they?
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.080]  Yeah.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:54.080]  Well, he had, you know, very dark, he had very dark eyes.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.680]  So his eyes wouldn't, you know, you wouldn't be able to,
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:58.960]  it looks at, you know what I mean?
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.260]  Like, if you have dark brown or black eyes,
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:04.880]  you don't see the cornea, or not the cornea,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.320]  what's that called, the iris like that.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.900]  Right.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.040]  But it makes it look, you know,
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.360]  sort of like the, what happened to Anakin Skywalker
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.960]  when he went to the dark side.
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.560]  I don't know, so I'm a little worried.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.400]  I do think.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.600]  It's not talking about the prequels.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.040]  I am going to watch this movie, but I did not watch.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.380]  Have you ever watched the Ashton Kutcher one?
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.900]  I have not seen any of them.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.840]  I did not see the Ashton Kutcher one, because.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.140]  I didn't even see Pirates of Silicon Valley.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:36.360]  I just, I really don't have a lot of tolerance for these.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.120]  Like, I mean, I would rather read a factual account,
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.320]  and I guess this is, this will probably be more factual,
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:49.920]  but I don't know, yeah, I don't know.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.560]  So you're not going to go see this?
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.220]  I don't have plans to go see it.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.280]  Maybe it's too on point, I don't know.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:58.120]  It seems like,
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:02.840]  it seems like the thing that I would go see,
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.640]  so that's why I don't want to go see it.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.040]  No.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.480]  But it seems like they're beating,
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.340]  and you know, I give them more power to them,
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.860]  because I don't feel like this is a dirty trick,
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:15.640]  but the Aaron Sorkin movie is coming out in October.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.040]  This documentary is coming out in September,
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.920]  so it's a way to sort of,
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.240]  clearly the documentary is going to have less,
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.880]  you know, as an independent production,
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.760]  it's not going to have the marketing behind it
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.760]  that the Aaron Sorkin blockbuster stars studied,
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.120]  fictional, fictionalized, fictionalized?
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.080]  What do you call something like that?
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.200]  Based on a two-story book, you know,
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.320]  the thing is going to have.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.160]  So it'll come out beforehand, and you can kind of
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.800]  piggyback, you know, on the publicity.
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:46.960]  Yeah.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.080]  But I'm not quite sure how it was screened.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.480]  It's out by Southwest in March,
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.480]  and it isn't coming out until September.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.080]  I don't know if they, have they, you know.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.960]  I guess they show sort of a pre-release.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.200]  Yeah, was that like a rough cut,
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.040]  or is that just how long it takes?
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040]  Yeah, probably, yeah.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.360]  I don't know.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.240]  Anyway, Eddie Q called it mean-spirited,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.040]  but I don't know, maybe that doesn't mean that it's,
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.440]  you know, maybe that, I don't know.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.720]  I've liked the guy's previous films enough
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.960]  that I'm gonna give it a shot.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.080]  It seems like you could, you could kind of portray him.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.320]  In, you know, depending on what you want to show,
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:23.680]  you can portray him in many different ways.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.840]  Yeah, well, I will put it.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.600]  There's definitely, there's definitely some things
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.400]  about Steve Jobs that weren't great.
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.400]  I don't think anybody necessarily denies that,
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.400]  but, you know, if you chose to just show those things,
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.800]  though, it wouldn't necessarily be an accurate depiction.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:43.920]  Right.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.760]  So be curious.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.560]  You know, it sounds as though, you know,
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.360]  he's gotten some people who used to work for him
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:52.780]  to, you know, do interviews.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.920]  I'm interested to see how recently they worked for him.
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.760]  Like, is this all stuff from the 80s and 90s,
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.400]  or has anybody who's worked with him,
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.240]  you know, in the last 15 years, you know, opened up?
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.080]  Yeah, because he, you know,
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.680]  certainly changed over the years.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:11.620]  Yeah, but, you know.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:14.360]  Not that he was ever, like, laid back,
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.640]  but I think most of his,
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.800]  his worst screaming was probably during the 80s.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.360]  Uh, third story.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.200]  You don't think so?
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.020]  Okay, all right.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.600]  Well, no, no, I think you're right.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.560]  I think you're right that most of it and the worst.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.880]  I'm not saying he stopped, I'm just saying.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.800]  Right, but that there were still some good stories
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.340]  from recent years, you know, of, you know,
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.380]  yelling and screaming.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.160]  Okay.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.080]  Trying to think what else is going on.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.280]  Have you got anything else going on?
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.240]  You talk about Spectre.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:47.840]  You want to talk about Spectre?
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:50.360]  Oh, we should talk about that, but let me take a break.
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.640]  Take one last break and thank our final sponsor,
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640]  and then we'll talk about Spectre.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.160]  That's a good one to finish up.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.000]  It's our another.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.680]  That trailer, that trailer I've definitely seen.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.360]  It's our good friends at Igloo, Igloo Software.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.180]  These are the guys who make the intranet, intranet,
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:12.460]  that you will actually like.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.800]  Share news, organize your files, coordinate calendars,
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.240]  manage projects, all in one place.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.780]  Their latest upgrade, they call it Viking.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.360]  That's the name of the upgrade to the Igloo platform.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.120]  Revolves around documents and how you interact with them,
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.040]  how you share them, how you gather feedback on them,
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.140]  and how you make changes.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.440]  They've even added the ability to track who has read
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:44.200]  or downloaded documents to keep everybody on the same page.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.640]  It's effectively, it's like read receipts for email,
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.520]  but less annoying.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.480]  You only see them when you're logged in.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.560]  It's not like they're gonna, you know,
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.840]  chase you down and bug you with them.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.280]  But it just helps you track whether people on your team,
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:02.280]  people that you work with who have to read something
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.440]  have actually read it.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.040]  Very simple idea.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.840]  Now they've added it to the Igloo platform, really great.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.960]  If your company has a legacy intranet
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.440]  that looks like it was built in the 90s,
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.120]  that's because it probably was built in the 90s,
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.560]  you should give Igloo a try.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:24.680]  They've got a fantastic deal.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:29.680]  Up to 10 people can use Igloo free of charge indefinitely.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.640]  You just, if you've only got like, you know,
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.160]  seven people on your team, you just sign up for Igloo
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.280]  and you just use it and you don't have to pay anything.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.080]  If you've got a bigger team, if you've got a bigger company,
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.840]  you can start a trial, get 10 people to try it
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.080]  and see, you know, if it's as good as I'm telling you
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.000]  that it is, if it's as good as Igloo says that it is.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.960]  And only when you agree that it is,
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.400]  only when you say, wow, this is great.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.080]  You know, this can totally, you know,
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.460]  be the hub for our communications.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:02.200]  Then you can start paying and they've got fantastic rates
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.460]  for, you know, numbers of employees above 10.
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.960]  So sign up for a free trial.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:07.800]  Here's how you go.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.620]  Here's, you don't even need a discount
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:11.360]  because it's free for up to 10 people,
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.100]  but at least they'll know you came from the show
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:19.100]  if you use this URL, igloosoftware.com slash the talk show.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.420]  The talk show, igloosoftware.com slash the talk show.
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:24.260]  My thanks to Igloo.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.720]  They're a great service and longtime supporters of the show.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.600]  So Specter, new trailer for Specter came out last week.
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:37.740]  I have mixed feelings about it.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:38.580]  Well, yeah.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.660]  And are your mixed feelings simply
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:45.340]  because of what you wrote?
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.380]  Yes.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.300]  Okay.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.540]  Yeah.
[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:51.900]  So I didn't get, see, I didn't get what you're,
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:54.320]  what you're alluding to there.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:57.580]  So wait, where did you, where did you read?
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:00.100]  So chilling, where did it say chilling connection
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.980]  between Bond and his enemy?
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.300]  Oh, that's on their website.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:05.900]  If you go to 007.com.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.900]  Okay, so I think I saw it on YouTube or something.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.000]  Yeah.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.660]  So I will put this in the show notes.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:15.340]  I'm trying to remain as spoiler free as I can for this,
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:17.100]  although not quite to the degree I'm doing
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.180]  for the Star Wars movie.
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.060]  The Star Wars movie, I don't, I don't even,
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.820]  I didn't even watch the second trailer.
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.660]  Oh my God.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:26.980]  I swear to God, that's, I'm going like full on,
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:31.180]  like you say Star Wars and I just go, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:32.220]  My ears are covered.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.260]  I just don't want to know a goddamn thing.
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:40.940]  With the, with the Specter trailer,
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.460]  I did go there and I read it.
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:45.860]  And at Whiskus, our friend of the show, Dave Whiskus,
[01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:48.340]  vouched for me that this was not a,
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:50.900]  cause he's got no self control.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.580]  He has absolutely no self control whatsoever.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:58.180]  So if, if they, if they released a trailer
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:02.360]  called the spoiler trailer, here's the spoiler trailer.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.740]  It'll spoil everything.
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:05.940]  It'll tell you everything that's happening in the movie.
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.020]  Dave Whiskus would watch it and then regret it instantly.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:10.500]  But then he would watch it.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:13.780]  He vouched for me that the trailer, the second,
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.020]  the new trailer for Specter was not, not spoilery.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.220]  And I agree with his conclusion having seen it.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.440]  I don't feel like I know the plot of the movie really.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.740]  Other than, other than what the title alone tells you,
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  which is that, you know, all right, Specter's back, right?
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.020]  I was bothered though, by the, the insinuation that,
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.540]  that there's like some kind of boyhood connection
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.860]  between James Bond and Specter.
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:41.580]  Well, and this, maybe I'm wrong about that.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:42.420]  I don't know.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:44.500]  It does not say boyhood. No, no.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:47.780]  But it does say connection, but it does not say boyhood.
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:48.620]  Right.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.320]  But I don't know.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.900]  I got a bad feeling about it.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.740]  Like I,
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.400]  Well, indeed, I, yeah, I agree that if you're, if you're,
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.300]  your supposition is correct, then I,
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.700]  that does seem kind of lame.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.640]  So I'm hoping it's not that.
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.140]  The best, the best email I got from a reader saying,
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:12.780]  hey, I don't think we should, I got the, somebody wrote
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.360]  to me, I forget, I forget everybody who writes me email,
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.620]  but here's, here's what made me feel better about it.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.460]  This is my fear.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:19.540]  My fear is that,
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.540]  Christoph Waltz is Blofeld.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:26.620]  Now, so far, so good.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:27.620]  If they're not saying it,
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:29.380]  they're saying Christoph Waltz is in the film.
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.800]  They're saying that he's like the leader of Specter.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.940]  If his name is Blofeld, fantastic.
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.060]  But they haven't spoiled that.
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.040]  I don't know if it is or not.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.100]  Everybody is thinking maybe, that would be great.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.500]  My worry is that they're gonna say like James Bond
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.860]  and Blofeld are like long lost brothers
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.020]  or something like that.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:50.600]  You know, that there's some kind of like family relationship
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.780]  or something like that.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.820]  And somebody who reads Daring Fireball said, you know what,
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.020]  I was worried about that too, but then I thought about it
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.700]  and realized that there's no way, even,
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:59.420]  even if they had the idea to do that,
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:00.580]  they'd realize they couldn't
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:03.100]  because Austin Powers did that.
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:07.020]  And they would realize,
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.620]  they would realize that they've stepped
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:12.920]  into the realm of parody and goofiness
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:16.260]  because Austin Powers had already done that with Dr. Evil.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:21.820]  Well, so the worrisome aspect would be
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.820]  if the people making Specter haven't even seen Austin Powers.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.500]  Right, and like they're putting the finishing touches
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.640]  on the edit right now.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.460]  They're doing the color correction,
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:38.820]  you know, double checking the spelling and all the titles,
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:40.160]  you know, the credits, you know,
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.540]  make sure everybody's, you know,
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.140]  got their name spelled right in the credits
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:44.340]  and they're putting.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.180]  Some guy walks into the editing room.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.300]  Guys.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:52.660]  This is the plot to Austin Powers.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:54.700]  We gotta get Christoph Waltz back in here.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:59.500]  We're gonna change a couple scenes real fast.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.220]  We're gonna for November.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.660]  We're gonna have to rerecord some of these lines.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.540]  Well, the trailer itself I think looks great.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:13.260]  Yeah, it does look great.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:15.100]  It's, you know, it's got basically everything
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:18.460]  you wanna see in a James Bond trailer.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:21.440]  Yeah, I also, I like the idea
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.280]  that without any kind of single overarching plot
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.880]  that spanned all these films
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.660]  that they're tying together some of the characters
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:34.180]  from the entire Daniel Craig era.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.380]  Right, yeah.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.680]  You know, with Mr. White who's played by,
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.200]  here's his name, who's a real creepy looking guy,
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.940]  Jesper Christensen.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.940]  He was the bad guy pulling the strings in Casino Royale
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:49.840]  and then at the end of Casino Royale,
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:52.020]  James Bond shows up at his porch and.
[01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.420]  Shoots him in the leg.
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.940]  Right, and then it's, you know,
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.460]  the best part of Quantum of Solace
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:00.860]  is that it opens like immediately afterwards
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:03.580]  and he's got him in the trunk of his car,
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.640]  which is really cool.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.020]  It was a kind of a cool thing
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.900]  because they never really did that with the Bond movies.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.900]  You know, they never really.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:10.060]  Tied them together in any way.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:11.420]  Yeah. Really, yeah.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:14.540]  Yeah, I mean, they were all, for the most part,
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:15.940]  I mean, a couple of references here and there
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.780]  and then a couple of like dumb references
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:20.220]  like this never happened to the other guy.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:23.560]  Right, well, my favorite example of like the opposite
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.140]  of that and back in the day when Dan and I were,
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.900]  you know, reviewing all these movies,
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.380]  they used to recast.
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:33.620]  They just cast the same actor in totally different roles.
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:34.440]  Yeah.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.360]  And so in,
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:39.540]  you only live twice,
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.360]  which is the one where Bond goes to Japan.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.760]  Sean Connery film.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.540]  I guess his fifth one, After Thunderball.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.300]  And he meets like the MI6 agent.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.420]  He's like an old British, older British fellow
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:59.300]  who's been their station guy in Tokyo for a long time.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.460]  And then he gets,
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:05.900]  he's a very nice guy, but he says to James Bond,
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:06.820]  it's kind of a famous scene.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.400]  He's gonna make him a drink and he says,
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:14.140]  I'm gonna make you a vodka martini stirred, not shaken.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.260]  Right?
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.980]  And of course that's backwards,
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.980]  but Connery being a gentleman just says,
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:21.460]  sure, you know, good enough.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.180]  You know, don't make a fuss, don't make a scene.
[01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:24.660]  And then, you know, the poor guy before,
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:26.260]  I think before he could even finish the drink,
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:27.180]  he got stabbed.
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:30.140]  Well, anyway.
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:30.980]  It happens.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.460]  That same actor is the guy who plays Blofeld
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:38.460]  in Diamonds Are Forever two movies later.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:39.300]  Yeah.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:40.960]  So like two movies later.
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.860]  Back then, particularly like 60s, early 70s,
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.700]  the only way you would see the movie is if it came on TV.
[01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:50.000]  You know, the only way you'd see it again
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.420]  is if it came on TV.
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.260]  Right.
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:54.780]  So they have it like, you know, sure,
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:57.180]  we'll just use the same actor, why not?
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.540]  Right.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.220]  We like the guy, we know the guy.
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:03.000]  They didn't even put like makeup on him.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.940]  They didn't give him like a wig or anything.
[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:06.660]  He looked exactly the same,
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.540]  except that instead of wearing a kimono,
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:10.460]  he was wearing a, you know,
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:13.460]  whatever you call those suits that Blofeld wears.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.420]  Yeah, a Nero jacket, right?
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:17.760]  Yeah, exactly, a Nero jacket.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:22.160]  Now, you had posted sort of a,
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.840]  kind of a more like an Easter egg, right?
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.920]  From Casino Royale.
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:27.760]  Yeah.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:28.600]  Someone had pointed out.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:29.540]  Yeah.
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:32.640]  Which was the guy who tosses in the car keys
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.600]  in the parking lot, tells him to park the car
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.460]  and then he like rams it into somebody's car.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:42.180]  Looked like Blofeld.
[01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.560]  No, no, no, not Blofeld.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.640]  Oh no, like Goldfinger, Goldfinger, that's right.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:47.480]  Looked like Goldfinger.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.400]  And then the license plate was a sort of a,
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.080]  what do you call those things?
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.080]  The code for.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.120]  Hexadecimal color.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.080]  Hexadecimal, yeah, for like a goldish.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.480]  The license plate to me was stretching it
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.100]  because it's, I feel like if they were gonna do it
[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:08.940]  on the license plate,
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.580]  maybe it would have been more like the atomic number
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.280]  for gold or something like that.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:14.100]  Yeah.
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.460]  No, I mean it sincerely,
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:20.000]  I think the hex color was really stretching it.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.920]  And it's not quite, it's not really very goldish.
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.520]  But his car was gold.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.240]  It was a gold colored Lexus or something like that.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:33.080]  And he does, I mean it's like the exact same sweater.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.500]  To me it's like beyond coincidence.
[01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.320]  Like maybe they weren't actually saying,
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.520]  hey, this is Goldfinger.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.360]  Maybe they were just kind of goofing around
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.560]  and it's not really.
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.400]  Yeah, that's what it seemed like to me.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.240]  It's more like an Easter egg than it's a.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.160]  Well, yeah.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.480]  Just a funny thing to put in.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.800]  Like we have to have a guy who's gonna toss him the keys
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:55.480]  and we want him to,
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.920]  he's gonna be a jerk
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:02.100]  and purposefully back his car into a thing.
[01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.720]  So we're gonna make the guy a jerk
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.720]  who just sort of assumes that he's the valet.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.000]  And then once you go down that path
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.080]  of making the guy a jerk,
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.560]  why don't you make him Goldfinger?
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.840]  It's kind of a cool joke.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.600]  I saw another thing too.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.200]  I will put it in the show notes.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.060]  Somebody, I didn't tweet this yet though,
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:27.760]  but somebody found out, somebody figured out.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.040]  In one of the old Ian Fleming novels,
[01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:32.440]  I think it was on Her Majesty's Secret Service,
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:37.120]  which was widely regarded as one of the best books
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.080]  that he wrote and that's the one that
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:44.080]  George Lazenby, Lazenby played the role, is polarizing.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.600]  It's my least favorite of the classic Bond movies.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.840]  Some people love it though.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.360]  But anyway, in the novel,
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.840]  James Bond has to escape from somewhere
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.440]  and he doesn't have any weapons on him
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:05.440]  so he uses his Rolex as a quote unquote knuckle buster.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.400]  So it's like brass knuckles.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.480]  So he takes his Rolex off, puts it around his fist
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:16.480]  and uses the stainless steel Rolex to bust some jaws.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.480]  And then they even said, it was like in the novel,
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.440]  it was like, and then the next day he woke up
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.020]  and the first thing he did was go to a jeweler
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:26.920]  to get a new Rolex because it's the only,
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.880]  it's like somehow it's described as the only watch
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:32.340]  that you can trust to crack skulls with.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:36.920]  So somebody figured out by freeze framing
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:41.080]  in Casino Royale, at the very end of Casino Royale,
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:44.700]  in the fight scene in Venice while the building is sinking,
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.840]  at some point when James Bond is fighting those guys,
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.580]  there's a scene where it looks like he turns
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.280]  his left wrist upside down the way you would
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.960]  to take off your watch and then it cuts immediately.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.420]  But then if you look at all of the punches he throws
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.760]  in the next scene, so you can see that Daniel Craig
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.360]  has a watch around his arm.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.460]  It's very clear.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.080]  Yeah, very, very clear.
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:09.040]  And so the speculation is that, but there's also,
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.960]  and that's the one with the really, really prominent
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.560]  product placement where on the train,
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:18.040]  where he first meets Vesper Linde and she's,
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:22.400]  he's like, well you, and he says, I'm good at poker
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.640]  because I can read people and he reads her
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.040]  and then she tries to read him and she says,
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.480]  I bet you have a Rolex and he goes, Omega.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.840]  Which is super, super, not only is he wearing
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:36.440]  an Omega wristwatch, he says it and he says it
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.160]  as though it means that it's better than a Rolex.
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:42.160]  It's like the best product placement they could ever have.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.760]  The speculation, nobody knows this,
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.120]  but the speculation is maybe they were going
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:48.080]  to use it that way and the Omega people were like,
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:53.080]  we don't wanna see the watch getting smashed into somebody.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:54.960]  I think they're nuts though.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:57.120]  I think if the Omega people shut that down,
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:58.520]  they're out of their minds.
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:02.880]  I think that that's, it would've even doubled
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.520]  what was already the best watch product placement
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.080]  in Bond history.
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:10.840]  But it was a cool thing to me.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.700]  People, they'd pay, pretty like car companies,
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.840]  pay a tremendous amount to see those cars destroyed.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.440]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:25.400]  I mean, Mercedes was a big part of the Jurassic world.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.720]  Oh, I haven't seen it yet.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.080]  Mercedes, like Jeep type things everywhere, yeah.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.520]  And even one, there's one I thought was kind of egregious,
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:41.520]  but I like the movie, but the kids run off on their own.
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:46.320]  They escape, they're sort of the person watching them
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.160]  and they run off on their own
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.480]  and they're like, because they wanna have a good time
[01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.480]  and she's just like plodding them through the dumb stuff,
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.160]  the dumb parts of the park.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.080]  And so the older kid says,
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.040]  they go see something.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:00.840]  Oh, I guess they go see the giant like fish dinosaur thing.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:03.720]  And then the older kid says to the younger kid,
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:08.320]  let's go see something else really cool.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.880]  And then they cut immediately to a Mercedes.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.280]  Sitting there and then, and like somebody walks in,
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.580]  I mean, it's sort of a seamless thing,
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.640]  but it's like, I was just like, oh God,
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.600]  they clearly paid for that.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:23.520]  There's no way.
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.700]  But yeah, I mean, those things all get like crunched up
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:28.920]  and mangled of course.
[01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:32.240]  Yeah, it chewed up and pooped out by dinosaurs.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.080]  Yeah.
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.240]  So who knows, maybe it wasn't,
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.320]  maybe it was just cut out just for the sake
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:38.160]  of cutting it out.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:40.000]  Maybe it wasn't even at their request, who knows,
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.600]  but it was a nice, I swear to God,
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.860]  I will put a link in the show notes,
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.520]  but it's a nice homage to original
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.020]  Ian Fleming source material.
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:50.980]  Yeah.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:51.820]  Yeah.
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:55.840]  So, and it came about somehow the guy who wrote about it
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.800]  was on a movie blog and he got the tip from a collector
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.440]  who bought the original prop that Daniel Craig wore
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:05.480]  for those scenes.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.360]  And it was a replica of whatever Omega Seamaster
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:14.520]  he was wearing at the time, but with a steel band,
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:17.900]  but with a, it was the watch itself was like rubber.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:19.560]  And he bought that original prop.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.480]  And it drove people.
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.360]  It made him, he was like, I did, you know,
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.760]  somehow I guess he talked to somebody
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.320]  with the props department,
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.400]  but it didn't make any sense
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.040]  that they would even have that prop.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.180]  And then he like went back
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.920]  and like watched the movie real closely
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.980]  and like freeze framed and figured out, you know,
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:37.040]  where it was used.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.900]  How many, how many movies is he in for from here on?
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:46.740]  That's a good question.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:48.400]  I think he's in for at least,
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.040]  I think he's in for this one more.
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.760]  Yeah, I think it's one more.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.640]  I was trying to see if it was on his Wikipedia,
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.800]  but I don't see it.
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:56.360]  No, I think it's at least one more.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.240]  And that would bring him to five, right?
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:02.880]  Yeah.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:03.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:08.700]  Which is, you know, and would also bring him to,
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:10.680]  and you know, the,
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.960]  you don't want to run into the Roger Moore problem
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.320]  where you, even with Hollywood makeup,
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:17.600]  you look, you just look too old.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:18.440]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:23.340]  No, he's not that, he's not that old.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.180]  He's not that old.
[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.020]  No, he's in great shape.
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.760]  He's still in his forties, yeah.
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.600]  Yeah.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.000]  I mean, Roger Moore was like,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.920]  when was he like 83 when he filmed the next one?
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.360]  He was really old by the time,
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.720]  I mean like those action scenes were just.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.560]  Brutal.
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.080]  You'd see some guy struggling to move
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:42.420]  and then all of a sudden he's running like crazy.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.400]  I think that was when we had to,
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:48.480]  I think he had to like run up the stairs of the Eiffel Tower.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.880]  The Eiffel Tower, that's yeah, that's exactly, yeah.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:53.280]  And it really was like this,
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:55.280]  yeah, the stunt was just Roger Moore
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:57.160]  running up a flight of stairs.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:01.780]  Wiped him out.
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.880]  It was no good for like a week after that.
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.740]  To his credit, he was on the record
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.620]  is that he wanted to wrap it up
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:16.760]  after whichever one he made in like 1981
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:17.600]  or something like that.
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:20.200]  And they begged him.
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:21.040]  Put more money at him.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.480]  Yeah, and just, and he made two more.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.480]  He made two more than he wanted to make.
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:30.720]  Anyway, that feels like a show.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.620]  I don't have anything else on my list of topics
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:33.460]  to talk about.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:36.600]  John Moltz, I thank you for returning to the show.
[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.360]  Where can people get more Moltz?
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:43.720]  Well, at Moltz on Twitter or verynicewebsite.net.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:45.720]  And your podcast with.
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:50.720]  Yes, and I podcast with Dan Morin and usually Lex Friedman.
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:54.680]  The Rebound, reboundcast.net.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:57.080]  And what's the other one?
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:00.160]  Turning this car around with Lex and John Armstrong.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:03.040]  Yeah, that's a parenting podcast.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.840]  Yes, and business ideas.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.480]  And business ideas.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:11.960]  Yeah, Death Coaster.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:16.260]  Death Coaster is one of our babies.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.000]  The theme park built around a Death Coaster.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.880]  You should open up a restaurant.
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:27.520]  That's a good business for you.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.800]  Death Coaster restaurant?
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.480]  Yeah, yeah, combine the two.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:35.200]  There'll definitely be a restaurant in the theme park.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:41.240]  All right, thank you, John.
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.120]  My pleasure.
[01:59:42.120 --> 02:00:11.360]  All right, go pick up your kid.
