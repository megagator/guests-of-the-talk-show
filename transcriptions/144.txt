[00:00.000 --> 00:06.540]  I understand, you know, I realize that record-breaking profits alone does not mean anything. It's, you know, all about growth
[00:06.540 --> 00:12.720]  but it the most profitable quarter that any any corporation has ever had in the history of
[00:13.300 --> 00:14.780]  corporations and
[00:14.780 --> 00:16.780]  the stock dived
[00:17.300 --> 00:22.260]  And yes, I understand there are some reasons for that, but it's still there's some
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.340]  Hyperbole. Yeah
[00:25.540 --> 00:28.180]  Some hysteria I should say hysteria involved
[00:28.180 --> 00:29.860]  And
[00:29.860 --> 00:34.760]  then in the aftermath of it and you know, I don't know what to leak and what's not but you know trying to
[00:35.180 --> 00:41.240]  You know steer the narrative another way now that all the rumors come piling out of the woodwork, you know
[00:41.240 --> 00:43.240]  about the bright rosy future that
[00:44.180 --> 00:52.020]  Right the converse and very many varied interests of Apple. Yeah, right and one of them is that today it's all over the place
[00:52.020 --> 00:53.340]  I forget who started it
[00:53.340 --> 01:00.300]  But that Apple is has quietly put together like a 200 person and team working on on VR, right?
[01:00.820 --> 01:02.060]  and
[01:02.060 --> 01:04.420]  the part that makes me roll my eyes is
[01:05.460 --> 01:09.400]  Of course, they have people work a lot of people working on VR
[01:10.380 --> 01:16.980]  If the only thing that would be shocking what would be truly shocking and would be like to me cause for alarm would be if a
[01:16.980 --> 01:20.140]  Report came out that said nobody within Apple is working on VR
[01:20.140 --> 01:23.660]  Well, it has no plans for VR and it thinks VR is trash
[01:23.980 --> 01:28.140]  It's just one guy named Dave who works on the cinema display team
[01:32.460 --> 01:38.460]  Yeah, it's like one guy named Dave who's sort of jury-rigged something with it, you know those cardboard boxes
[01:39.980 --> 01:44.140]  That would be shocking the fact that they're they're looking at this is
[01:45.260 --> 01:47.700]  That this is treated as news really really
[01:47.700 --> 01:51.500]  Yeah, actually I think that was from the FT
[01:53.940 --> 01:55.540]  You know the
[01:55.540 --> 01:58.020]  the story itself was
[01:58.700 --> 02:00.740]  None, as you mentioned none too shocking
[02:00.740 --> 02:04.900]  I mean they what they got going on there is there's a bunch of people working on VR
[02:05.260 --> 02:11.580]  Apple takes it fairly seriously in terms of like hey, we should explore this and that's pretty standard
[02:11.580 --> 02:13.580]  It's far for the course any major
[02:13.580 --> 02:18.500]  big technological kind of you know invention or or or
[02:19.300 --> 02:26.060]  Infusion of new tech into an industry. You've got a bet a corporation as big as Apple doesn't matter what their philosophies are
[02:26.060 --> 02:30.380]  They're going to at least experiment with it and play with it and see if it fits within their milieu
[02:30.380 --> 02:33.980]  You know right in the way that you could have written the same thing about touchscreens
[02:34.300 --> 02:40.080]  Five six, maybe even ten years before the iPhone came out. Mm-hmm that they were you know
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.520]  Investigating it trying to see if they could you know, is there a product to be made out of this?
[02:44.680 --> 02:50.800]  Yeah, exactly and Tim Bradshaw had that report at the FT and Tim is usually pretty well sourced and stuff
[02:50.800 --> 02:53.360]  So I don't really doubt much in his report
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.920]  but you're right in the fact that it's like everybody treats it as like like, you know, a
[02:59.400 --> 03:04.340]  Holy Grail moment and it's like yeah. Yeah. Sure. I mean I can tell you that I think it was maybe
[03:04.340 --> 03:12.180]  three years ago that I first heard Apple was sort of like hiring a few people in like the the games
[03:12.540 --> 03:15.780]  Industry and graphics industries and sort of looking at VR
[03:16.420 --> 03:21.220]  Maybe maybe two years ago. And so I and I you know, nothing more than scuttlebutt
[03:21.220 --> 03:25.540]  so nothing really to report on and you know kudos attempt for like getting a bunch of
[03:26.780 --> 03:31.300]  Triangulations on that but I think it would be really silly to assume that they weren't working on it
[03:31.300 --> 03:37.100]  That would be the bigger thing. Yeah, and I'm not trying to say that Tim Bradshaw's original report is the one that is saying that
[03:37.100 --> 03:40.560]  It's a shocker, but it's just the the reaction though across the yeah
[03:41.060 --> 03:42.940]  the web to it as
[03:42.940 --> 03:46.020]  Wow, I thought Apple was done making new products
[03:47.700 --> 03:53.780]  Yes, but actually that does seem to be the assumption in a lot of these stories and you have to wonder it and not just
[03:53.780 --> 03:57.260]  VR but every time right like every time I was like a dual lens thing or
[03:57.260 --> 04:04.280]  Right a VR thing or whatever or car thing and it's like the assumption is always that you think the reader is stupid enough
[04:04.540 --> 04:08.980]  To believe that Apple was like done. That was it. You know, I mean for them
[04:10.140 --> 04:15.080]  Never they're never going to release anything different than the iPhone ever again, you know
[04:15.080 --> 04:15.660]  All right
[04:15.660 --> 04:17.500]  and the other part that gets me is the
[04:17.500 --> 04:22.540]  Undercurrent and nobody will quite come out and say it because if they came out and said it point-blank it would sound stupid
[04:22.540 --> 04:27.540]  but the way that they react though is when something like this comes out and it's a a
[04:28.340 --> 04:29.760]  I'm not gonna say pie in the sky
[04:29.760 --> 04:35.060]  But it's something that is almost certainly years in the future from being the actual product on the market
[04:35.060 --> 04:38.860]  It's exciting and a sign that maybe Apple's best days are ahead of it
[04:38.860 --> 04:45.180]  And then let's just say that like at some kind of VR driven thing comes out from Apple in
[04:45.180 --> 04:54.020]  in 2017 or 2018 and then it comes out and then it only sells like two million units in the first year and
[04:55.140 --> 05:00.460]  Only the quote-unquote only makes, you know, four or five billion dollars in revenue in the first year
[05:00.540 --> 05:03.540]  Well, then it is it's a dud. It's
[05:04.100 --> 05:08.300]  Not gonna move the needle. It's pointless. It's a failure and
[05:09.140 --> 05:13.980]  Let's move on to the next thing. You know that when it's a vague notion
[05:13.980 --> 05:21.700]  It's super exciting and then when it's an actual product it and and it isn't the biggest thing it since the iPhone
[05:21.700 --> 05:27.640]  Then it's it's no good and as you see that all week long in my opinion with the reaction people have had to the watch
[05:28.220 --> 05:30.560]  Right and and Apple's, you know quarterly
[05:31.300 --> 05:33.300]  finances, yeah, and you may
[05:33.660 --> 05:41.060]  It is more. I mean anytime you get something you get a concept that involves more gray and more complexities
[05:41.060 --> 05:46.780]  It's gonna be hard to either make it the narrative and it's gonna be hard to convince people to want to
[05:47.140 --> 05:51.860]  Buy into it because it's not as exciting right? It's it's more about nuance, you know
[05:51.860 --> 05:55.660]  It's talking to somebody about the difference between two different jazz singers
[05:55.660 --> 06:01.180]  Not the difference between rock and roll and R&B or rock and roll and classic or old music or whatever, you know
[06:01.180 --> 06:05.700]  There's more subtlety involved. So if you get into an area where Apple is a
[06:05.700 --> 06:11.580]  Company that's made up of a bunch of really solid smaller businesses and one massive business
[06:12.180 --> 06:18.960]  Nobody wants that they want Apple to have another blockbuster business like the iPhone to it replace the iPhone, right?
[06:18.960 --> 06:26.220]  You know, that's that's the narrative currently anyway, right and it's there's nothing that can be done to dismiss it. Mm-hmm
[06:26.740 --> 06:28.740]  I
[06:29.020 --> 06:31.840]  Am VR in particular is it's
[06:31.840 --> 06:39.000]  It's an interesting thing to think about from Apple's perspective or from someone who appreciates Apple's perspective because it could mean anything
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.640]  Right, right. Whereas like Apple is building a car. That's pretty specific
[06:43.640 --> 06:48.400]  It's we know what a car is, you know, it's a thing that you get and there's all sorts of well
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.640]  How are they gonna charge to the you know, assuming it's an electric?
[06:51.640 --> 06:55.280]  How are they gonna charge it and what kind of battery technology they have and there's all sorts of you know
[06:55.280 --> 06:59.440]  Details to be worked out but we still know cars whereas the idea of Apple getting involved with VR
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.800]  It really could be any or all of the various different things
[07:03.800 --> 07:09.840]  It could be something completely entertainment driven like an extension of Apple TV and it's for gaming and stuff like that
[07:10.640 --> 07:14.940]  And that's a lot of you know, I don't know what you saw at Sundance, but I'm guessing at Sundance in particular
[07:14.940 --> 07:17.240]  It's a lot of entertainment in some way
[07:18.080 --> 07:21.720]  Yeah, mostly mostly entertainment stuff. There's some documentary stuff and
[07:21.720 --> 07:28.240]  And a large large majority of it is is based around sort of three
[07:29.720 --> 07:37.260]  360 photography and not as much 3d environments yet. Although I did play in some 3d environments. There are some studios making
[07:38.240 --> 07:40.880]  Stories, you know telling stories in 3d environments
[07:41.280 --> 07:46.560]  Which is a whole nother thing the whole studio system or content creation system for VR
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.900]  But majority of it right now all film based entertainment based. Yeah
[07:50.900 --> 07:55.420]  Well, the other the thing that Apple could do that might be different than anything we've seen so far
[07:55.420 --> 07:58.380]  Is this could be something that is meant for you know?
[07:58.380 --> 08:04.580]  being like a display for the Mac and it could be a way to get like, you know, some sort of
[08:05.220 --> 08:07.220]  heretofore science fiction is
[08:07.580 --> 08:08.620]  style
[08:08.620 --> 08:13.340]  Super wide display that is right in front of you while you do your work. Mm-hmm
[08:14.540 --> 08:18.440]  Yeah, it could be I mean the VR so VR if you
[08:18.440 --> 08:23.920]  Want to think about what Apple is gonna do and and how Apple might use VR
[08:23.920 --> 08:29.860]  You have to sort of think about a VR in the macro for just a sec and the macro V VR
[08:30.440 --> 08:32.760]  right now the macro for VR right now is
[08:33.520 --> 08:41.040]  You have two diverging pathways you have the people that are really pushing the technology forward and doing the most advanced
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.960]  Craziest things you can think of and those are the VR headsets that are hooked up to a powerful computer
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.280]  You know, this is all the stories that came out about oculus like oh sure the oculus is 600 bucks
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.760]  But you have to have a $15 computer to run it, which is true
[08:54.760 --> 09:02.200]  And those are the that's like the gamer segment, you know gamers game games and pornography have always driven technology forward
[09:02.200 --> 09:04.200]  Right like the internet
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.080]  Computing power home video. Yeah home video exactly. A lot of those things have really been driven off of
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.060]  gamers and and
[09:13.060 --> 09:17.680]  Pornography and that's you know, it's neither here nor there. I'm not making any value judgments on either one of those
[09:17.680 --> 09:19.860]  I'm just saying that's the reality of it
[09:19.900 --> 09:25.020]  So when you look at VR do you look at pornography and gamers that is going to be driven?
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.520]  Usually probably at least the gaming segment by more powerful
[09:29.240 --> 09:36.520]  experiences driven by powerful computing devices a desktop computer essentially that is powering your you know
[09:37.040 --> 09:38.440]  big
[09:38.440 --> 09:45.200]  complex virtual experience whatever that may be whether it's a game or a communal world where a bunch of people live in it like a
[09:45.680 --> 09:47.680]  snow crash type thing
[09:47.720 --> 09:55.560]  Or whatever, that's all that branch. So that's really one school of thought one branch of exploration of VR. The other half is
[09:56.420 --> 10:00.200]  the Samsung gear VR right, which is a
[10:01.400 --> 10:06.100]  Headset that you snap a phone into and it becomes a VR headset, right?
[10:06.100 --> 10:12.360]  It's like a plastic shell and you know with a couple lenses in it not much beyond the cardboard the Google cardboard
[10:12.840 --> 10:14.160]  Except that it's not made out of cardboard
[10:14.160 --> 10:21.040]  It's made out of plastic and you snap your phone into it and it becomes a VR headset and that mobile mobile VR
[10:21.220 --> 10:24.580]  Experience is much more a mass-market product
[10:24.680 --> 10:30.100]  Like that's something you could like take on vacation and that your kid plays within the backseat or whatever, you know
[10:30.100 --> 10:37.540]  And that that kind of mass-market VR is the other branch and I feel that we won't really see
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.600]  anything from Apple
[10:39.600 --> 10:47.460]  That's consumer focused until those branches converge until we have a mobile platform. That is enough power to power
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.680]  Fairly robust VR experiences that you can do without wires
[10:53.380 --> 10:57.420]  Because I just don't see an Apple headset with a bunch of wires connected to a big computer
[10:57.420 --> 11:01.080]  That's just not that's not the kind of company they are anymore, you know
[11:01.880 --> 11:04.080]  Does it make sense? Yeah, I think it does make sense
[11:05.720 --> 11:08.240]  It's intriguing though to think about or I
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  wonder if the
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.900]  The route to get there without wires isn't necessarily it would still involve having I
[11:17.580 --> 11:21.200]  Can only assume the GPU in the headset
[11:21.200 --> 11:28.040]  It's just that waiting for like the you know, a 12 or a 13 system on a chip where there's this insane
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.960]  graphics processor on a you know, super low power low weight low heat
[11:33.560 --> 11:39.120]  Chip that it can also be sold at a very consumer II sort of price. Mm-hmm
[11:39.720 --> 11:45.320]  Yeah, and so the question is whether or not we see anything in between those two products from Apple, right? Right. Yeah
[11:45.320 --> 11:49.120]  so we're I mean, maybe they do release something where it is cabled and and
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.920]  You know shows off what it can do and it's like well, this is v1 and then you know v2 maybe oh look
[11:54.920 --> 11:56.240]  There's no cable anymore or whatever
[11:56.240 --> 11:56.880]  but I mean
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.360]  I think that the processor in in the iPad Pro if you can get that into a scenario where you have like a
[12:02.640 --> 12:09.880]  You know an 8 ounce battery or whatever that that fits in a headset and can power that for four or five hours or six hours
[12:09.880 --> 12:13.940]  I don't know that seems like a pretty powerful little utility, you know, yeah
[12:13.940 --> 12:19.700]  Yeah, I don't know. It's you know, is it entertainment? Is it work? I don't know. It could be both
[12:19.700 --> 12:23.740]  I don't know, but I you know, it's obviously a huge source of
[12:25.740 --> 12:32.260]  What-ifs, you know, right and I think I think a large portion of the VR industry is based off of what ifs at the moment
[12:32.260 --> 12:38.060]  Because not only is there there are not enough consumer endpoints. I mean the oculus just shipped
[12:38.060 --> 12:43.700]  It's it's sort of like retail unit and I mean not shipped but rather but open pre-orders for right
[12:43.700 --> 12:45.220]  They got you know thousands of pre-orders
[12:45.220 --> 12:51.340]  but until that hits there really is a very very very tiny amount of people that can even experiment with a
[12:51.660 --> 12:53.660]  decent VR headset and
[12:54.060 --> 13:00.100]  That I mean, there's a long way to go before there are enough consumer endpoints for Apple to even consider
[13:00.220 --> 13:02.700]  You know kind of releasing a product in that field
[13:02.700 --> 13:06.500]  I mean, everybody's got a wrist like everybody needs a phone, you know what I mean?
[13:06.500 --> 13:14.060]  like there's there's just not that need in the VR yet, but I
[13:16.340 --> 13:17.900]  Wonder I don't know I
[13:17.900 --> 13:23.060]  Feel like it's it's too hard to figure out what they're doing with it yet. But of course, they're working on it
[13:23.300 --> 13:26.420]  Mm-hmm could be interesting. It'd be funny if it was I
[13:27.420 --> 13:29.740]  occurred to me that would be funny if it was part of the
[13:30.620 --> 13:32.460]  part of the car
[13:32.460 --> 13:39.620]  Yeah, yeah, that would be interesting wouldn't it? And I mean that honestly augmented reality
[13:39.620 --> 13:44.760]  Which many people do lump in with virtual reality because it has some similar characteristics
[13:45.380 --> 13:48.320]  Is I think that's a given on the car
[13:48.320 --> 13:55.380]  I I can't see how Apple releases a quote-unquote car of the future according to Apple and doesn't include
[13:55.900 --> 14:00.100]  The ability to overlay information on your view, you know what I mean?
[14:00.100 --> 14:05.420]  I mean, there's car makers that have been doing versions of that for for almost a decade now or more
[14:05.860 --> 14:11.580]  With like your speed or like left turn right turn or even a traffic warning or whatever, you know
[14:11.580 --> 14:16.700]  a HUD like Mercedes does that BMW does that on some of their cars so imagine like a
[14:17.940 --> 14:24.580]  Live map display that shows you exactly which turns to make overlaid on the street itself, you know
[14:24.580 --> 14:27.420]  So it's not distracting it maps one to one with the street
[14:27.420 --> 14:32.500]  It's not something that you're looking at and then looking back at the street and then looking at your windshield in the back of the street
[14:32.500 --> 14:38.740]  You know, there's lots of really cool opportunities. I think if they would be crazy not to ship something like that together, you know
[14:39.100 --> 14:41.400]  Yeah, and it's exactly the sort of thing that Apple
[14:43.420 --> 14:46.460]  Gets right, you know, I I think that it's there
[14:46.460 --> 14:51.300]  I don't think there's any doubt whatsoever that that the future of turn-by-turn directions is
[14:51.300 --> 14:58.700]  In the actual view you get out of the car not mmm-hmm not secondary in the same way that
[14:59.180 --> 15:02.060]  part of the magic of the iPhone compared to
[15:02.620 --> 15:09.020]  The GUI computers that came before it was the direct manipulation that there you're not moving a pointer to click a button
[15:09.020 --> 15:13.180]  You're just clicking the button with your finger. Yeah, same point and and it there's
[15:13.700 --> 15:20.220]  It makes sense that that's better that it's but I think feel like the advantages of it aren't even in the way that it makes
[15:20.220 --> 15:25.580]  Sense they're in at like a lower level part of your brain that it's so much cognitively
[15:27.060 --> 15:31.420]  Unburdened because there's a level of abstraction that's gone same way that it'll be with
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.900]  Whether it's directions or whatever else you want
[15:34.900 --> 15:40.060]  like just show me you know show me restaurants that are open and they highlight in the actual field of view as
[15:40.380 --> 15:46.260]  You drive by them stuff like right or just a little indication that a place is open or closed at this at
[15:46.500 --> 15:48.500]  9 o'clock as you drive by
[15:48.500 --> 15:50.500]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, and
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.140]  One of the things I like to do when I think about
[15:54.020 --> 15:56.100]  Possibilities like this and this is really kind of silly
[15:56.100 --> 16:02.700]  It's just it's a dumb device, but I like to seriously think like could I imagine them announcing this on stage?
[16:02.980 --> 16:08.780]  Right, like could I'm how how would I see them pitching it? And yeah, this is not like it's not hyper original or anything
[16:08.780 --> 16:13.220]  But if you imagine somebody like, you know, Schiller on stage introducing the car
[16:13.220 --> 16:20.740]  And he goes, you know, and he's saying like look, you know, there are so many accidents caused by people looking down at their phones
[16:20.980 --> 16:27.440]  Texting and driving or look even just looking for directions even as if it's something that's allowed by the state or federal governments
[16:27.620 --> 16:31.940]  We still know it's not safe and yet we do it anyway because we have to we feel we have we need
[16:32.020 --> 16:39.300]  The directions or we need the information but now you don't have to you know now here's here's how we at
[16:39.300 --> 16:45.540]  Apple felt by working together with hardware and software manufacturers and everything working as one big unit
[16:45.540 --> 16:50.980]  Here's how it could improve your life blah blah blah, right? And it's just like if you imagine that it seems like an easy sell
[16:50.980 --> 16:56.240]  It's like yeah, I think it's all that you know, and yeah, it seems silly enough to think that that's a part of it
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.300]  Yeah
[16:57.300 --> 17:02.780]  Yeah, so I almost I I really do think and it comes to it's an old Steve Jobs line
[17:02.780 --> 17:06.100]  But that the whole argument about whether or not anything in particular
[17:06.100 --> 17:09.300]  I mean he famously he I think he said this to the Dropbox kids
[17:09.300 --> 17:12.820]  but you know, is this a technology or is it a product and
[17:13.940 --> 17:17.620]  You know the other thing he's he, you know repeated it many times. Is that you?
[17:18.180 --> 17:23.940]  the only way he knows to make a great product is to start with the idea for the product and then work backwards and
[17:23.940 --> 17:29.940]  Find the technology to make it realistic not to start with. Wow. We've got this amazing technology, right?
[17:29.980 --> 17:34.980]  Let's figure out a way to turn this into a product which is to me where
[17:34.980 --> 17:38.740]  And not to like put oculus rift down
[17:38.740 --> 17:40.740]  but to me oculus rift is that type of
[17:41.060 --> 17:47.900]  product at this at this point and I know they have great people working on it and I know you know it that they could
[17:48.420 --> 17:55.260]  Make that happen and it's the sort of thing where maybe the technology itself is so standalone that it's in this case like with the display
[17:55.260 --> 17:58.980]  Which is effectively what it is. It's just a display. Maybe you can make that work
[17:59.380 --> 18:04.620]  But with Apple it's never gonna be that way and I could see that that that the team that they have working
[18:04.620 --> 18:10.100]  Isn't even working on one specific thing, but you know three four or five different things. Mm-hmm
[18:10.100 --> 18:10.580]  well
[18:10.580 --> 18:16.100]  I mean think one of the reasons that oculus sold to Facebook and that Facebook bought them and that was a mutually agreeable thing between
[18:16.100 --> 18:21.860]  Them is that is they looked at it and they realized that oh shit. We're gonna have to spend a bunch of money
[18:22.700 --> 18:30.140]  Trying to get this platform essentially hardware platform up and running and out to people before we even
[18:30.700 --> 18:32.340]  Start creating things on it
[18:32.340 --> 18:34.900]  And so they they thought hmm well
[18:34.900 --> 18:41.600]  How can we remove the the worry about having to fund and a very expensive hardware manufacturing phase?
[18:42.420 --> 18:48.300]  And then move right into what we think will actually be the money which is the worlds
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.540]  right the things that you create on top of it because I talked to
[18:53.420 --> 18:59.300]  Brendan Arribae who's the CEO of oculus and he you know, he was a it was very
[18:59.300 --> 19:07.860]  Involved in gaming for some time. He was involved in like Sony's Sony bought it, but their PlayStation gaming streaming service and whatnot
[19:07.860 --> 19:12.940]  So he's not he's not a dummy. He knows that the the the services on tops on top of
[19:13.580 --> 19:16.460]  VR are where people are gonna make their money and
[19:17.020 --> 19:25.620]  In terms of oculus, they don't have to worry now about how are we gonna sell these things at a affordable price point?
[19:25.620 --> 19:30.380]  Because they even said that the oculus rips as they are they're selling a really close to cost, you know
[19:30.380 --> 19:32.380]  that for six hundred bucks or whatever and
[19:32.860 --> 19:38.600]  Instead they can get stuff out there and see what people build and then you know those social
[19:38.940 --> 19:42.580]  Experiences and games and whatever else that gets built on top of them
[19:42.620 --> 19:45.780]  That's what will actually take off and be a thing
[19:45.780 --> 19:49.620]  And so right now there's it doesn't make any sense for anybody to go
[19:49.620 --> 19:53.580]  Oh, let's get into hardware unless they're already in the business of
[19:53.580 --> 19:57.460]  manufacturing commodity hardware because that's what it is, you know
[19:57.460 --> 20:02.740]  It's gonna you should be able to buy a VR headset for 50 bucks and put it in your bag
[20:02.740 --> 20:06.100]  And you'll be able to buy better ones that do you know better stuff and whatnot
[20:06.300 --> 20:12.460]  But you should be able to buy one for 50 bucks shove it in your bag and have it hook up to your your mobile
[20:12.460 --> 20:14.460]  phone wirelessly and
[20:14.620 --> 20:19.020]  It'll be powered by the internal GPU and it'll transport you to whatever world you want
[20:19.700 --> 20:21.700]  mobile on a mobile basis and
[20:21.700 --> 20:27.820]  And until they're there and the content is there nobody's gonna make any money at it, you know, yeah
[20:29.320 --> 20:35.820]  Here's another rumor of the week or at least rumor of the day is is a story Bloomberg had today
[20:36.980 --> 20:38.820]  that
[20:38.820 --> 20:40.820]  Apple is working on wireless charging
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.460]  And I laugh again because
[20:46.460 --> 20:51.020]  Of course it's the dawn of time everybody's wanted to charge with the wires
[20:53.020 --> 20:56.140]  Of course they're working on wireless charging and you know
[20:56.140 --> 20:58.500]  I guess the news the news angle of it is that
[20:58.980 --> 21:04.260]  According to the story at Bloomberg that it might be ready as early as 2017, right?
[21:05.940 --> 21:10.660]  Which is a little weird because it doesn't really match up with the
[21:10.660 --> 21:16.460]  Tick-tock schedule of iPhones, you know that it seems more likely to me that
[21:17.260 --> 21:23.580]  If it doesn't happen this year in the iPhone 7 it's probably not gonna happen till 2018 and the iPhone 8
[21:24.860 --> 21:30.660]  On the assumption that this year's iPhone 7 will be followed by the iPhone 7s next year
[21:31.860 --> 21:36.740]  But maybe not, you know in a way that like things like touch ID appeared in an s year
[21:36.740 --> 21:40.540]  You know and that it may be the wireless charging wouldn't replace the lightning port
[21:40.540 --> 21:44.620]  It would be just something that it just magically happens when you connect a wire, you know
[21:44.780 --> 21:48.660]  something on the back of the phone, so it's possible that it could happen in an s year, but
[21:49.540 --> 21:50.980]  overall the
[21:50.980 --> 21:56.740]  Basic ID, you know, it's great. I hope it happens, but I just can't I think I just can't
[21:57.460 --> 22:02.100]  Can't make my head understand the excited reaction that people have to this
[22:02.100 --> 22:08.580]  To this report, you know what? I think it is and I mean, I think this is partially a construct construct of the media
[22:08.580 --> 22:13.700]  But it is something Apple has probably you know, I don't hesitate to use the word blame
[22:13.700 --> 22:18.220]  But they have responsibility for and that's that they do execute on things, right?
[22:18.220 --> 22:23.780]  So like there's been wireless charging Android phones for some time this Qi wireless standard or whatever is it's okay
[22:23.780 --> 22:27.300]  I have a couple Android phones that charge that way and it does work
[22:27.300 --> 22:32.700]  It works works fine, you know, you put it on the little pad and it charges and whatnot, but it's not really wireless
[22:32.700 --> 22:38.380]  You still have a pad with the wire attached and the only thing you're doing is you're just not physically plugging it in, right?
[22:38.380 --> 22:41.580]  Yeah, so the execution of wireless
[22:42.300 --> 22:48.620]  Charging in terms of oh I can stand near my charger and it when it charges or I can be you know
[22:48.620 --> 22:53.180]  Within 10 feet of the charger and my phone will charge it'll probably be much closer to the charger
[22:53.180 --> 22:59.180]  Then that in reality, but you know that that I think that execution thing is what gets people excited about Apple
[22:59.180 --> 23:02.900]  And it's where I can sort of forgive people for going. Yes. Finally Apple's gonna do it
[23:02.900 --> 23:09.700]  It's because they know that if Apple does it there's at least some I mean people bitch about the way that Apple executes on stuff a lot
[23:09.700 --> 23:16.700]  Right because they do claim a lot about their things they claim thing that things they do are really good and awesome
[23:16.700 --> 23:18.700]  And that's that's their fault
[23:18.700 --> 23:23.900]  I guess you'd call it but people just expect the level of execution out of them
[23:23.900 --> 23:29.940]  So when when they hear that Apple is gonna do X or Y they're like, oh, this is gonna probably be a really good X or Y
[23:29.940 --> 23:36.100]  Well, and it's also human nature. It's actually easier to criticize something. That's sort of in the uncanny valley between
[23:36.700 --> 23:40.980]  It's way definitely way better than a pile of shit, but it's not great
[23:40.980 --> 23:45.100]  Then it's really it's a lot easier to figure out exactly what you're doing
[23:45.100 --> 23:51.500]  Right, and right and when a product is really truly just a garbage product
[23:51.500 --> 23:56.100]  It's actually harder to say exactly what's wrong with it because it's you don't even know where to start. I
[23:57.700 --> 24:03.780]  Mean it's really true. I mean, I know it sounds over and and Apple at their worst usually is the
[24:04.420 --> 24:09.900]  Has a couple of glaring problems that stick out like sore throat thumbs not the this is like sore
[24:09.900 --> 24:17.700]  sore battery pack humps, right like the as an example of a product that I would consider total dog shit would be like the original
[24:19.300 --> 24:26.580]  HTC Android phone from 2008. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah the the one and the one yeah
[24:27.100 --> 24:30.100]  The Nexus one. Yeah, and it was wasn't it brown?
[24:31.300 --> 24:38.140]  No, maybe I'm confusing. They're brown and gray maybe yeah, I think it was the one that was the one that was the one
[24:38.140 --> 24:41.020]  They're browning gray. Maybe I don't they had a couple of colors
[24:41.020 --> 24:41.660]  but yeah
[24:41.660 --> 24:48.540]  but it was it really just the only way it made any sense at all is if you knew as a good designer that
[24:48.940 --> 24:54.340]  Android had started life and until like the iPhone was unveiled a year before it was sort of a Blackberry style
[24:54.580 --> 24:58.500]  operating system with an up-down left-right input method and
[25:00.460 --> 25:04.140]  Without a touchscreen and then they had this device that was like half and half
[25:04.140 --> 25:09.300]  Where all sorts of stuff like text editing all had to be done with up down left, right?
[25:09.500 --> 25:14.380]  Right and with no touch at all and then other things they tried to glom on
[25:14.380 --> 25:19.420]  It was it was so bad that it was hard to criticize. Yeah in that context. You'd be like, hey, this is pretty good
[25:22.620 --> 25:25.660]  Yeah, I do think and there's a daring fireball reader
[25:25.660 --> 25:26.660]  I forget who it is
[25:26.660 --> 25:30.660]  and I apologize if you listen to the show to who sent me a really great note that I really
[25:30.660 --> 25:37.180]  Appreciated that I was I think when I linked to something a few weeks ago that was quote-unquote using wireless charging
[25:37.820 --> 25:44.500]  Took me to task for it because it wasn't wireless at all. And as an example, so for example, Apple watch does not charge wirelessly
[25:45.420 --> 25:48.500]  You definitely need a wire and it needs to be in physical contact
[25:48.740 --> 25:53.980]  It's just charges. It is a magnetic adapter and if you actually look at Apple's
[25:54.420 --> 25:58.340]  Marketing for the Apple watch Apple never claims that Apple watch charges wirelessly
[25:58.340 --> 26:04.460]  Mm-hmm, like that's not wireless and and you know, for example, if you're networking work that way
[26:05.500 --> 26:08.140]  You would definitely not call it wireless networking
[26:08.140 --> 26:14.500]  Like if you to get on your Wi-Fi you had to magnetically connect your your MacBook to your router
[26:14.980 --> 26:22.380]  It might be better than plugging and unplugging in the an Ethernet adapter, you know magnetic would be better than that
[26:22.380 --> 26:28.020]  But it's definitely not wireless wireless is like Wi-Fi where if you're in the room, you've got the network
[26:28.020 --> 26:34.180]  Like and so if that is what Apple is working on for charging, that would be actually pretty amazing. Mm-hmm
[26:34.620 --> 26:42.180]  Yeah, and they there's a lot of this kind of loaded topic this whole wireless charging thing because there's a lot of arguments about the physics
[26:42.180 --> 26:43.100]  Right, right
[26:43.100 --> 26:47.820]  It's like there's a lot of people that say the physics of it just doesn't make sense because of the power loss
[26:48.140 --> 26:53.620]  over distance and then also there's some you know, some safe basic safety concerns as well because you're sending a
[26:53.620 --> 26:58.900]  a relatively high-powered radio signal to transmit this power
[26:59.540 --> 27:06.180]  This energy from your charging device to the phone, but there's a startup called you beam which is founded by this
[27:06.940 --> 27:11.340]  woman named Meredith parody and it's probably the poster child for
[27:12.300 --> 27:18.220]  a huge promise and like big big attention spike and everybody's thinking hey
[27:18.220 --> 27:22.420]  This is revolutionary if it actually ships this way and then also the cross
[27:22.420 --> 27:28.300]  The cross section of people who are like this is BS and how can this actually work?
[27:28.300 --> 27:33.580]  The physics don't work and whatnot, you know, and there's there's lots of question marks until they actually ship a product
[27:33.580 --> 27:39.500]  They're getting ready this year to ship a case that supposedly will charge this way wirelessly
[27:39.500 --> 27:45.420]  And so I think that'll be an interesting proof of concept if that ships and they are able to prove that it does then
[27:45.420 --> 27:49.140]  All of a sudden, you know, every manufacturers gonna have to have it built in
[27:49.140 --> 27:55.540]  Yeah, and you know, somebody will probably end up acquiring you beam or whatever and if Apple's working on it internally and they ship
[27:55.540 --> 28:01.780]  But you know sure as heck Samsung or somebody will try to acquire you beam so that they they can catch up on that front
[28:01.860 --> 28:06.740]  Yeah, there's you know, it does sound good too good to be true. I mean, but I I
[28:07.420 --> 28:08.660]  I
[28:08.660 --> 28:13.980]  Struggled with the later physics courses in college. So I I really don't want to pass judgment on
[28:13.980 --> 28:21.340]  Yeah, the basic layman's argument that you laid out that this is not physically possible or not within, you know, a reasonable
[28:21.740 --> 28:23.180]  degree of
[28:23.180 --> 28:24.420]  efficiency
[28:24.420 --> 28:30.020]  Makes sense to me. But on the other hand, you know, I don't know Wi-Fi it honestly still doesn't make much sense to me
[28:30.340 --> 28:34.060]  That it works. Yeah Wi-Fi there's like Ethernet
[28:34.060 --> 28:39.260]  I totally understand how Ethernet works and right and you know the whole idea that
[28:39.260 --> 28:43.620]  As many people as can get on a Wi-Fi network can get on a Wi-Fi network
[28:44.100 --> 28:49.380]  And that it all works and everybody gets the right packets. It's right still seems a little too good to be true to me
[28:49.380 --> 28:54.820]  So if they could make Wi-Fi work starting in the late 90s, I don't know maybe wireless charging, you know
[28:54.940 --> 28:59.020]  I'm not ruling it out. Yeah, it'll be like the gods must be crazy moment
[28:59.020 --> 29:02.580]  Like, you know, the soda can fall from the sky and everybody will just be like, oh my god
[29:02.580 --> 29:05.780]  Yeah, everything has to have this. I mean I I'm the same way
[29:05.780 --> 29:11.340]  I don't know, you know, I'm not Jack about the physics of it. I just talked to smart people and that's what they tell me
[29:11.820 --> 29:17.540]  So it'll be it'll be very very interesting to see what happens when and if it ships and it works
[29:17.900 --> 29:22.460]  because I think it'll be a that's probably gonna be a watershed moment for a lot of technology because
[29:22.940 --> 29:28.260]  Think about all the technologies that would work pretty great if you had a continuous source of power
[29:29.540 --> 29:31.540]  That was not attached by a wire
[29:31.540 --> 29:36.140]  And that and that battery, you know is not enough to support
[29:36.220 --> 29:39.220]  So it's just the beginning of a lot of really cool technologies
[29:39.220 --> 29:40.620]  If if that's the case
[29:40.620 --> 29:46.820]  There's like let's say you could stand within 20 feet of your car and it would charge every all your electronic devices
[29:47.060 --> 29:51.000]  You had on you, you know, yeah lots of interesting possibilities there
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.180]  So I'm excited about it, but cautiously optimistic is the the right phrase
[29:55.180 --> 29:59.940]  I think right. All you have to do is get in your car and your phone and
[29:59.940 --> 30:03.940]  And watch are already charging right, right? You didn't do anything
[30:03.940 --> 30:06.680]  You just got in and turn on the car and started going to work
[30:06.980 --> 30:13.460]  And you're thinking what do I want to listen to and maybe that's the only thing you're paying attention to because the car can drive itself
[30:14.340 --> 30:18.300]  And you're just trying to figure out what you how you want to entertain yourself on the way
[30:18.300 --> 30:24.060]  And I mean time you're without having to worry about it. You're watching phone or charging. It's a heck of a way
[30:24.060 --> 30:27.620]  it's an interesting it's also a very interesting way for Apple to get from the
[30:27.620 --> 30:30.460]  Hey one day of battery life kind of sucks for the watch
[30:31.100 --> 30:34.300]  to to a couple of days of battery life
[30:35.820 --> 30:40.940]  Without really changing the the basic nature of
[30:42.460 --> 30:50.340]  Batteries. Mm-hmm because it's really more about making it so much easier and convenient to sort of trickle charge throughout the day. Mm-hmm
[30:50.780 --> 30:55.840]  Yep, exactly a nice way to sidestep the whole cuz speaking of physics right now
[30:55.840 --> 31:01.300]  There are a couple of physics problems that are essentially preventing any progress in the battery department
[31:01.300 --> 31:05.300]  Like every company is spending millions or billions of dollars if they have them
[31:05.300 --> 31:11.060]  you know every big electronics company to try and figure out the battery issue right the problem of
[31:12.040 --> 31:14.720]  How the capacity and longevity of batteries?
[31:15.300 --> 31:21.980]  but nobody is really able to make any huge progress because there are some physics problems that I have not been solved yet and
[31:21.980 --> 31:28.480]  Everybody's trying to figure out what materials to use and like carbon nanotubes and you know all kinds of other
[31:30.040 --> 31:32.360]  Mechanics that try to make batteries better
[31:32.520 --> 31:37.280]  But the fact of the matter is is that there's not much you can do right now until somebody
[31:37.640 --> 31:41.800]  figures out that some crack or hole in the world is is
[31:42.080 --> 31:48.040]  There that wasn't there before and figures out how to either create a new material or put materials to work
[31:48.040 --> 31:53.940]  In a new way so it if you can charge it just like Apple's been doing with
[31:54.320 --> 31:57.120]  processor optimization and chip optimization for years
[31:57.160 --> 32:02.560]  They've essentially been sidestepping this thing, you know kind of by making their stuff more efficient
[32:03.080 --> 32:08.320]  It's a similar kind of thing. So maybe we can't break through batteries, but we can charge them constantly throughout the day
[32:08.320 --> 32:15.120]  Yeah, I do think I that's that's the main thing I take away from it that that's sort of a big goal for the next
[32:15.120 --> 32:16.620]  10 years
[32:16.620 --> 32:20.720]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at audible.com

[32:57.680 --> 33:02.720]  They're great audiobooks if you're listening to I think this is why they sponsor podcasts if you're listening to podcasts
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.800]  You know the advantage of having long-form
[33:05.800 --> 33:12.000]  Long-form spoken word audio content audiobooks are a great way to add to the
[33:12.680 --> 33:17.880]  Playlist the listening, you know what you have queued up for your commutes or your flights road trips
[33:18.880 --> 33:22.920]  I know for a fact just I without even doing any kind of research
[33:22.920 --> 33:27.240]  I know tons and tons and tons of you who are listening to my voice right now are doing it on your daily commute
[33:27.240 --> 33:32.180]  And I know from how often you email me about maybe trying to get more episodes of the talk show out than I do
[33:32.180 --> 33:36.260]  That you need more content. Well audiobooks are a great way to do that a
[33:37.260 --> 33:42.260]  Lot of them these days are actually read by the authors themselves. It brings an extra dimension to the text

[34:15.080 --> 34:17.080]  talk show
[34:17.840 --> 34:20.560]  Usually they ask for like a recommendation I'll give you a recommendation
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.620]  I'll tell you a book I just finished and they do have it on audiobook. It's Philip K Dix the man in the high tower
[34:26.620 --> 34:30.260]  Which is it's a book I've read
[34:30.260 --> 34:31.300]  I have like Philip K
[34:31.300 --> 34:36.100]  Dick is one of those guys who I've been a fan of since I was a teenager but never like finished reading everything he had
[34:36.100 --> 34:37.100]  written
[34:37.100 --> 34:42.380]  And I remember I had a friend in college who swore up and down that the the best Philip K
[34:42.380 --> 34:47.740]  Dick book ever written was the man in the high tower and it was like the high praise for that book that made me file
[34:47.740 --> 34:51.460]  It away. It's like sometimes I'm stupid like that and I there's books that I really want to read that
[34:52.140 --> 34:53.780]  If I'm really looking forward to it
[34:53.780 --> 34:56.620]  I save it and then you know, eventually I'm gonna die and
[34:57.700 --> 35:01.820]  books go on red the basic gist of the man in a high tower is what if
[35:03.180 --> 35:09.140]  What if the United States had never gotten involved with World War two and Germany and Japan had won and then carved up?
[35:10.060 --> 35:13.660]  More or less defenseless the United States that woke up too late to the threat
[35:14.300 --> 35:18.460]  takes place like in the early 60s and what pushed me to read it is that
[35:18.460 --> 35:26.420]  And I was about to say Netflix but it's Amazon came out with a TV series based on it and I wanted to read the book
[35:26.420 --> 35:29.100]  Before I watched the show and so I did and it was fantastic
[35:30.380 --> 35:35.060]  So if you want a recommendation, I would take get the get the audiobook for the man in the high tower
[35:36.460 --> 35:37.940]  Did you ever read that?
[35:37.940 --> 35:40.560]  No, I haven't read it. I know of it
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.740]  I've read other Philip K Dick stuff, but not that so I'll put that on my deathbed list. Yeah
[35:45.740 --> 35:49.740]  Then I watched episode one of the Amazon show and I didn't like it at all
[35:52.100 --> 35:58.900]  I don't know why but maybe I have to give it I'll give it another episode or two just to see but I I thought
[35:58.900 --> 36:01.940]  That it was it just wasn't what I?
[36:02.820 --> 36:04.820]  What I liked about the book
[36:05.580 --> 36:07.580]  But we'll see
[36:08.820 --> 36:10.820]  So what else what else is going on
[36:10.820 --> 36:12.700]  I
[36:12.700 --> 36:14.700]  Don't know
[36:15.380 --> 36:17.740]  What's going on right now, I mean I think that there's
[36:18.940 --> 36:24.440]  This little right now is sort of like a stretch of time where it's earnings report after earnings report
[36:24.440 --> 36:30.340]  you know all the q1 like everybody figures out how all the the big companies did in in q4 or
[36:31.500 --> 36:34.000]  fiscal q1 whatever you want to call it and then
[36:35.020 --> 36:38.460]  After this it starts like people start announcing stuff again, you know
[36:38.460 --> 36:41.900]  Yeah, they kind of want to get their wave off of how they did if they did good or whatever
[36:42.580 --> 36:45.540]  Facebook announced an enormous just an absolutely
[36:46.100 --> 36:47.940]  blockbuster quarter
[36:47.940 --> 36:49.940]  yeah, and everybody you know and
[36:50.980 --> 36:57.340]  Just everybody seems unanimous to agree that that was about as good as good as quarter as Facebook could have announced
[36:57.420 --> 37:02.100]  that in terms of any metric that they're that they're tracking revenue and profit and
[37:02.100 --> 37:09.900]  Active users whatever else that it's just great. Mm-hmm seems to be a very well-run company
[37:11.460 --> 37:16.340]  Yeah, I think so, I don't I don't think they I think they know what their core competencies are now
[37:17.020 --> 37:19.920]  And and are executing on those really well
[37:19.920 --> 37:25.900]  I think Facebook is one of those companies that like almost everything it did during 2015 just worked
[37:26.420 --> 37:30.460]  Like they I mean they had a few things here and there were apps like individual
[37:30.460 --> 37:36.000]  Spin-off apps that they released maybe didn't you know set the world on fire or anything, but they were still interesting experiments
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.180]  And it's just almost everything they tried to do. They did a really really good job with
[37:41.980 --> 37:44.060]  I mean, I think they had like up
[37:45.580 --> 37:48.620]  During I don't know if you saw but during like the the
[37:49.740 --> 37:55.900]  Problem in France the terrorist attack in France. They had this sort of safety check. Yeah feature
[37:55.900 --> 37:58.500]  They launched and that's indicative of something that only
[37:58.500 --> 38:05.420]  Makes sense for a platform on Facebook scale like you literally say hey is your family member?
[38:05.420 --> 38:11.460]  Okay, and of course they can check in on Facebook because of course they have an account, you know, I mean with there's
[38:12.340 --> 38:17.620]  1.59 billion people on Facebook every month. That's just every month, right?
[38:17.620 --> 38:20.500]  So maybe somebody has an account but doesn't go in check in every month
[38:20.740 --> 38:23.780]  It's in it's probably in the several billions that have an account
[38:24.020 --> 38:27.500]  So if you see that there's a terrorist attack and you go, you know
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.780]  I don't really log on on my Facebook, but I'm gonna go on there and see if anybody's okay
[38:30.780 --> 38:35.860]  You can see that safety check thing and see that your loved one or friend has checked in safe
[38:35.860 --> 38:41.420]  I mean, that's a pretty impressive thing to a roll out and and execute well
[38:41.620 --> 38:45.700]  But also the fact that they can even do it at all, but it's feasible for them to do
[38:45.700 --> 38:50.900]  So, you know it speaks to the how enormous that platform is and how well they've executed
[38:51.940 --> 38:57.220]  I think it's crazy though. And again, I don't want to make this an invest investor hour
[38:57.220 --> 38:59.220]  Yeah, yeah
[38:59.580 --> 39:03.780]  but I I like thinking about and especially I think you're right that the
[39:04.300 --> 39:07.100]  Holiday quarter both for especially for Apple
[39:07.100 --> 39:13.300]  But for everybody is sort of like the biggest one because it's sort of the referendum on the calendar year coming to a close
[39:13.860 --> 39:15.860]  I
[39:16.100 --> 39:20.820]  The fact that Facebook is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 109
[39:21.700 --> 39:23.700]  It's to me
[39:23.700 --> 39:25.700]  Again, I'm not an expert
[39:25.700 --> 39:30.660]  I it just says to me. Maybe people are a little too excited about Facebook and
[39:31.300 --> 39:34.340]  Where they're going, maybe not maybe not but it's
[39:35.060 --> 39:37.060]  That's a pretty high PE ratio
[39:37.900 --> 39:39.900]  mm-hmm
[39:40.220 --> 39:42.800]  Because I'm not quite sure if they've already got
[39:44.500 --> 39:47.100]  1.5 billion active users
[39:47.100 --> 39:52.780]  There's not there's not a lot of upside there in terms of how many more people they can get using
[39:52.780 --> 39:59.060]  Yeah, because their Delta is the amount of people that have access to the internet versus how many people are already on Facebook, right?
[39:59.060 --> 40:02.340]  That's their growth Delta, right? And it's that's not huge
[40:02.340 --> 40:09.020]  It's there but it's not all 8 billion, you know, all 8 billion people are not I'm not on Facebook. So
[40:09.820 --> 40:11.660]  there
[40:11.660 --> 40:13.920]  this is almost funny, but it's like
[40:15.140 --> 40:20.100]  it's almost if you could spool it out a little bit further it would get really dystopian because
[40:20.100 --> 40:22.100]  Facebook's
[40:22.220 --> 40:26.920]  Growth strategy currently is not get more people on Facebook
[40:26.940 --> 40:32.700]  It's get more people on the internet, right? Which is pretty crazy when you think about it because it's like
[40:33.860 --> 40:40.620]  Clone people or birth people that can use our product, right? That's essentially their their strategy
[40:40.620 --> 40:42.960]  It's like if you know Apple said oh well
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.220]  We're going to create breeding farms that breed people who can use buy more iPhones if they choose
[40:48.220 --> 40:55.380]  yeah, I've thought about this too that it's it's sort of like that and Google is in a similar situation where Google is is
[40:56.100 --> 40:59.940]  Similarly a part of their growth strategy is to get more people on the internet
[40:59.940 --> 41:01.940]  And that's why you see companies like Facebook and Google
[41:02.340 --> 41:09.580]  Launching these these programs like like Google had the one where they had internet wireless internet routers connected to balloons
[41:09.580 --> 41:15.300]  I think they still have it and I don't think they've stopped it but that they're gonna launch balloons around the world that you know
[41:15.300 --> 41:21.540]  Rain wireless networking down into areas that that that don't have good internet access
[41:23.260 --> 41:25.260]  And again, it's one of those things that you know
[41:25.260 --> 41:32.340]  Just sort of circle back to the magic of Wi-Fi that wireless solves that problem in a way that wired networking never would you know?
[41:32.340 --> 41:39.660]  And that trying to get people when when most of the Western world was first connected, you know in a communications network
[41:39.660 --> 41:41.660]  It was the phone network in the way that we did
[41:41.660 --> 41:48.340]  It was by literally stringing copper wire in and out of every room in every building in every house
[41:48.980 --> 41:50.020]  across
[41:50.020 --> 41:52.940]  Multiple continents which is not cost-effective
[41:52.940 --> 41:59.500]  You know like as much as it sounds like a science fiction idea to have these balloons floating over Africa that
[41:59.860 --> 42:05.740]  That give people wireless networking. It's it's actually just just look at the back of the envelope
[42:05.740 --> 42:08.980]  it's a lot seems a lot easier and a lot more financially feasible than
[42:08.980 --> 42:11.220]  stringing cable to everybody
[42:12.820 --> 42:18.300]  But again, it's in their own interest like you said really that it's getting more people on the internet
[42:18.300 --> 42:23.860]  This is the only way that they can grow and and the point I'm getting to is that this the strategy is sort of it's
[42:23.860 --> 42:27.140]  Sort of like the Catholic Church like you need to have a lot of babies
[42:29.220 --> 42:32.580]  Yeah, how do we spread the religion have six or more babies
[42:32.580 --> 42:39.060]  We need that we need you to have as many children as possible so that they can be Facebook and Google users 12 and 13 years
[42:39.060 --> 42:41.620]  Yeah, make some new Catholics. Yeah, right
[42:44.620 --> 42:46.020]  Man I don't know
[42:46.020 --> 42:46.380]  I mean
[42:46.380 --> 42:53.780]  I think that there's there's plenty of opportunity there for people to do interesting things with big big networks that are
[42:54.100 --> 42:58.460]  Really exciting but then you also the other side of it the other half of it is
[42:58.460 --> 43:05.820]  If Facebook is their conduit to the internet, right and so Facebook is not a nonprofit
[43:06.140 --> 43:08.140]  right, they're not a
[43:09.420 --> 43:14.740]  Entity that has no interests and it's not you know, that's not a fault of theirs that just is what it is, right?
[43:15.020 --> 43:18.380]  So there they have a definite desire
[43:18.860 --> 43:21.720]  To get people on the internet so that more people can use Facebook
[43:21.780 --> 43:25.300]  but those people that come on the internet are gonna come into an internet that is
[43:25.300 --> 43:28.340]  hosted and and absorbed by
[43:30.860 --> 43:32.860]  Facebook and I
[43:33.060 --> 43:37.020]  Gotta worry about that, you know, you got to think like man
[43:37.020 --> 43:40.500]  I wonder what how that could distort their view of the world
[43:40.500 --> 43:47.820]  I mean people already talk about Facebook's newsfeed and how it presents certain things or doesn't present other things to its users
[43:47.900 --> 43:53.400]  Which is a completely valid concern and you know, hey Facebook is probably trying to do its best to make more people use it
[43:53.400 --> 43:57.300]  And that's fine. But at the same time, you know, what's the deal?
[43:57.300 --> 44:01.220]  Like are we going to get a view of the world?
[44:02.180 --> 44:07.460]  The developing world is going to get a view of the larger world that it's connected to
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.220]  Through Facebook's lens and is that a good thing? Is it a bad thing? It's probably somewhere in between
[44:12.600 --> 44:15.460]  It's just a thing but it's sort of a creepy thing
[44:16.300 --> 44:18.300]  Yeah
[44:18.900 --> 44:22.940]  Here's a question I got from a during fireball reader, I'll just read I'm not gonna mention
[44:22.940 --> 44:26.340]  I think it's a reasonable question. I think it's the wrong way to think about it
[44:26.340 --> 44:30.820]  so I'm not gonna use his name because you know, but it's here's the question I got this is a
[44:31.960 --> 44:37.020]  Two days ago. Do you think Apple's decision not to get into the social space will turn out to be a mistake?
[44:37.340 --> 44:45.500]  Facebook stock is up 12% today. There are 1 billion iOS devices at the very least. Why not an Instagram competitor?
[44:45.500 --> 44:48.460]  They're already storing the photos. It seems like a no-brainer to me
[44:48.460 --> 44:54.660]  If nothing else they could slow down Facebook's growth a bit. Tim Cook didn't sound good yesterday. Can you only imagine the stress? He's under
[44:56.020 --> 45:00.380]  And here's what I wrote back real quickly, but I really I think it's true
[45:00.380 --> 45:04.380]  I think the worst thing Apple could do is chase after ideas just because they're profitable
[45:04.380 --> 45:07.180]  That's the sort of thinking that led Microsoft to stray
[45:08.900 --> 45:15.140]  To me this was Microsoft at in its heyday like circa the mid 1990s
[45:15.620 --> 45:16.660]  was
[45:16.660 --> 45:24.660]  They were making all this money and they had all this engineering talent and everything was that was happening was happening on Windows computers
[45:26.660 --> 45:33.540]  And that they would look at any idea that anybody came up with that gained any sort of traction whether it was financial or just
[45:33.900 --> 45:37.540]  Interests because you know like Netscape for example wasn't really making a lot of money
[45:37.540 --> 45:42.160]  But they were gaining tons of users and had all this attention and anybody who had anything
[45:42.160 --> 45:48.220]  Microsoft would look at and say well we got to get into that too, and then they they did and I feel like that's a
[45:48.220 --> 45:50.220]  terrible way to run a company
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.920]  Because it's it's
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.440]  And it's sort of to me
[45:54.440 --> 45:59.760]  It's the opposite of the way Apple is always has achieved the success that they've had which is to be very you know pick
[45:59.760 --> 46:03.460]  And choose the things where they can make a difference and where they they really want to be
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.920]  Like so it has Apple directly profited from the rise of social networking
[46:09.920 --> 46:11.940]  No, really
[46:11.940 --> 46:16.540]  I mean the only thing that they ever really tried was ping and what they did in our heart wasn't really in that that was
[46:16.540 --> 46:18.540]  Just a way to try to sell more music
[46:18.780 --> 46:22.540]  And but on the like sort of secondary level
[46:22.900 --> 46:29.020]  They've profited greatly because people have social networking is a huge reason why people want to carry
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.500]  Cellphones smartphones with them everywhere they go and take them out of their pocket whenever they have a few minutes
[46:34.500 --> 46:38.140]  It's the fact that people are doing
[46:38.540 --> 46:45.060]  So much on Facebook throughout the day on their phones and doing Instagram on their phones or doing Twitter from their phones
[46:45.740 --> 46:51.340]  That they care so much about their iPhone that Apple benefit. You know there is it's you know they don't get to
[46:52.560 --> 46:55.820]  You know their stock doesn't go up just because more people are using Facebook
[46:55.820 --> 47:00.660]  But at some level part of the iPhone success and therefore part of Apple success is
[47:00.660 --> 47:06.660]  The success of things and popularity and the way that everybody I mean just you know
[47:06.660 --> 47:11.560]  Regular normal people have taken to these networks like fish to water
[47:12.180 --> 47:14.000]  Mm-hmm
[47:14.000 --> 47:21.080]  Yeah, I think that there is an argument that if they are going to invest in anything like you took you
[47:21.100 --> 47:23.940]  Do you think about their statements their repeated statements that?
[47:24.660 --> 47:28.640]  It's important that they own their technology, right, right?
[47:28.640 --> 47:30.280]  to
[47:30.280 --> 47:33.080]  A degree owning your technology these days
[47:33.600 --> 47:36.560]  Doesn't just mean owning the bits of hardware that go into it
[47:36.560 --> 47:42.560]  It means of course the software stack too right and the software stack includes the underpinnings
[47:42.720 --> 47:49.240]  But also the things that run on it right so the things that run it are also the things that run on it so
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.080]  Apple goes hey, you know we made this great thing
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.360]  We're gonna get developers to build great apps or we're gonna encourage them to build great apps
[47:56.360 --> 48:01.240]  And they're gonna build amazing apps, and they have benefited significantly from that so then you have to go well
[48:01.720 --> 48:06.800]  At some point Apple's got to go these particular segments and categories of apps
[48:07.120 --> 48:14.800]  Are so popular and so important to the iPhone success like you know you look at the you can look at the battery indicator
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.280]  On your phone you know the new little thing in iOS that tells you how much battery each app is using
[48:21.280 --> 48:28.800]  And you can get a unless some app is acting naughty you get basically a cross section of what's important to you like which apps
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.840]  are important to you and which ones you use your phones for you your phone for and
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.440]  That kind of gives you the heads-up of like oh these are the things that are most important to me
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.200]  This is what this is how I use my iPhone, and so I'm sure Apple has all those statistics as well
[48:42.200 --> 48:48.080]  So they know exactly what people are using their phones for the most so then you have to say hmm
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.240]  I wonder if at some point. They go people use their phones 60% of the time for messaging
[48:53.540 --> 48:58.520]  You know why why are we not building iMessage out into a true messaging platform?
[48:58.520 --> 49:02.960]  You know and they have done some of that they have done a little bit of that, but then you go well
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.080]  Why isn't it a social network? You know why isn't iMessage a social network?
[49:06.080 --> 49:13.320]  I guarantee you top battery usage is probably Twitter and Facebook on many people's phones right or Twitter or Facebook or Twitter and Facebook
[49:13.320 --> 49:21.240]  And so yeah, I mean there's there's a definite definite thought process that you could see churning there where it's like yes
[49:21.240 --> 49:23.400]  We don't like to split our spread ourselves too thin
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.240]  But if we were going to take on a project wouldn't the things that people use their phone for?
[49:28.440 --> 49:32.460]  The most and second most be something that we might be interested in you know yeah
[49:32.860 --> 49:40.280]  My guess is that in the aggregate if you looked at everybody who's used an iPhone in the last month
[49:40.280 --> 49:42.280]  My
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.860]  Guess is Facebook would be in the top spot the most time more than any other app
[49:51.400 --> 49:58.200]  My guess from number two and three it's hard to say because I don't know like Facebook's the one where you just know that
[49:58.200 --> 50:00.200]  There's that many people using it
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.960]  Where Twitter would be I don't know I guess it's up there
[50:03.960 --> 50:05.960]  But I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even
[50:05.960 --> 50:11.440]  Close if it's not number two, and I'll guess I would guess the other app that for some people has got to be way up
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.440]  There is mail
[50:14.320 --> 50:17.760]  And obviously that brand brand who is an old person
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.440]  You know or a work person, but people you know
[50:21.880 --> 50:28.680]  For people whose jobs largely revolve around email or email is a primary part of it boy mail can really suck up
[50:28.760 --> 50:30.880]  the time on your phone mm-hmm
[50:31.880 --> 50:33.760]  Yeah, yeah
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.960]  You're I think you're right in that you're gonna get like a demographic slice like there's gonna be some things
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.400]  that certain people use a
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.720]  Significant amount and then other people don't like it might if I'm if I go into mine
[50:47.720 --> 50:49.880]  I'm gonna go in here. I'm just gonna look at mine
[50:53.320 --> 50:55.320]  So if I go to
[50:56.400 --> 50:58.400]  Where's this damn thing
[50:59.140 --> 51:01.140]  They keep moving around yeah
[51:01.140 --> 51:05.220]  Battery, it's first level, but it's in the third group battery
[51:06.340 --> 51:11.220]  Okay, so yeah if I can look at my top list here wait for it to refresh so it's phone
[51:12.900 --> 51:18.780]  Because I have a lot of conference calls that I actually have laughing because I literally did not expect it
[51:19.980 --> 51:22.780]  That's really funny so phone is my number one
[51:22.780 --> 51:28.800]  And I'm guessing that's because I just spend an enormous amount of time on the phone talking to people
[51:28.800 --> 51:32.080]  Either in meetings or sources and that sort of thing
[51:32.520 --> 51:35.980]  And I've also been doing a lot of work kind of doing some hiring right now
[51:35.980 --> 51:37.420]  So I've been talking to a lot of potential hires
[51:37.420 --> 51:41.460]  So I'll just chalk that up to abnormal because I don't think it's usually number one
[51:41.560 --> 51:49.280]  But then number two is Twitter number three is Instagram, which is owned by Facebook number four is mail then home and lock screen
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.560]  Messages slack Safari, and then it kind of dwindles down to below 1% for the rest of them
[51:55.560 --> 52:02.260]  Yeah, mine mine for the last 24 hours tweet bot is 65% mail 8% Safari 6%
[52:03.040 --> 52:08.600]  Messages 4% mm-hmm. I have a feeling we're kind of boring like I think a lot of people's would be snapchat
[52:08.840 --> 52:16.000]  Like I think snapchat would be up there. Here's here's my seven days. It's probably more accurate tweet bot 49% Safari
[52:16.600 --> 52:22.100]  21% mail 7% slack 3 messages 3 phone 3
[52:22.100 --> 52:25.060]  Yeah, I think I'll sort it dwindles off in there now
[52:25.060 --> 52:31.620]  my tweet bot is super high because I really that's really just the majority of what I do is I'm either reading the actual tweets or
[52:33.620 --> 52:39.220]  Especially now that they have this Safari view controller when I find a link to read I read it right there in
[52:40.260 --> 52:40.980]  tweet bot
[52:40.980 --> 52:47.460]  So it's really misleading like I think if you could separate my tweet bot when I'm actually reading tweets versus tweet bot when I'm reading
[52:47.460 --> 52:54.060]  a web view it would be very different like and it's not any kind of indication in my personal experience that tweet bot is a
[52:54.740 --> 53:00.540]  egregious battery user it's really that my it's just my by so far in a way the most used app on my phone
[53:02.700 --> 53:06.420]  Yeah, and I think that those you look at those opportunities and
[53:07.180 --> 53:13.300]  Apple probably looks at that data as well. And then they they go hey, you know, should we be in this particular area?
[53:13.980 --> 53:15.980]  and I think that
[53:15.980 --> 53:22.220]  Usually usually the decisions are probably made by can we 10x this right?
[53:22.220 --> 53:26.220]  And if they can't 10x it if they can't do something 10 times better
[53:26.420 --> 53:28.620]  Then they just leave it alone and be like well
[53:28.620 --> 53:34.460]  We're you know, we'll make the best platform we can for this particular use case and let somebody else build it
[53:35.100 --> 53:42.380]  Yeah, I thought to me is the sweet spot of where Apple's opportunities for future growth are or just maintaining them thing
[53:42.380 --> 53:47.940]  They have now is to make sure that the platform is the place where the next thing is going to be built as opposed to
[53:47.940 --> 53:49.940]  Trying to build that next thing themselves
[53:50.420 --> 53:53.060]  Right, and if you spend too much time trying to build the thing
[53:53.420 --> 53:58.580]  Then you end up sending a signal to people who could potentially build some random thing
[53:58.580 --> 54:05.100]  You haven't heard of right right that that is super successful like snapchat for instance or whatever, right?
[54:05.420 --> 54:10.780]  You kill that desire for them to innovate on your platform because you're sending them a signal like oh
[54:10.780 --> 54:14.620]  We're going to subsume you at some point or we think we can do this better
[54:14.740 --> 54:19.780]  So we're not going to offer you the best tools and that's always a danger with Apple because they do have native apps as well
[54:19.780 --> 54:23.460]  And native functionality and so they have to balance the needs
[54:24.100 --> 54:29.620]  their own needs versus the needs of the developer so that they're signaling properly that this is a
[54:30.300 --> 54:34.500]  hospital of hospitable environment for people that want to build new things and
[54:34.500 --> 54:40.620]  And yeah, that's important. It's important for any big platform. Which is why I think people were so kind of pissed at Facebook
[54:40.620 --> 54:46.580]  This week with the whole parse thing. So alright. Well, let's we should talk about that. I guess I don't know
[54:46.580 --> 54:52.900]  I don't know enough about it that the developer details of it, but more or less. Well, maybe you should explain it
[54:53.580 --> 54:59.260]  yeah, I mean, you know, I'm nobody's parse engineer either, but I do it basically is a
[54:59.260 --> 55:04.300]  a back-end service that allows people to spin up mobile apps and
[55:05.180 --> 55:11.520]  Utilize its services for the backside of the app all of the database handling and a variety of other things
[55:11.780 --> 55:19.020]  So they can build UI and concentrate on overall user experience without having to build all of the infrastructure themselves
[55:19.860 --> 55:25.320]  This was essentially a kind of a buy that Facebook made Facebook acquired them for I think like 38 million dollars or something
[55:25.320 --> 55:31.760]  a couple years ago and they acquired them at a time when their stock was kind of hurting they were hedging their bets because they
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.000]  Weren't doing well on mobile ads. They weren't converting. Well their users well to to
[55:37.780 --> 55:41.840]  Mobile ads or revenue to mobile ads which now by the way, they are like something 80%
[55:42.280 --> 55:44.780]  Right of the revenue comes from mobile ads, which is insane
[55:46.400 --> 55:53.680]  But they they were hedging bets and so they thought we need a service like Amazon has with AWS where we can be
[55:53.680 --> 55:55.680]  like the service provider
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.640]  For all of these other apps and if we don't if we don't end up being in a consumer
[56:02.160 --> 56:06.120]  Facing success with our revenue. We'll have this other source of revenue to back it up
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.320]  you know because they could see the writing on the wall finally that you know, everybody's going to mobile people want native and
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.360]  Their ads weren't converting. Well, so this was a sort of hedge thing for them
[56:16.120 --> 56:22.360]  And then I guess they figured I mean from what I've heard all they all they looked at was like
[56:22.360 --> 56:24.720]  Not a lot of people were using it they could do without it
[56:24.720 --> 56:25.800]  So they shut it down
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.440]  But it did send a lot of signals to people who develop on Facebook that if Facebook doesn't feel like they needed
[56:32.440 --> 56:35.920]  You know, it's going away and you're gonna be stuck in the lurch
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.080]  If a large portion of your app was built using this, you know tool that Facebook acquired or maintained
[56:42.740 --> 56:48.920]  Which is a danger I think right and the whole appeal of something like this is look you you know
[56:48.920 --> 56:53.120]  This way you can keep your team small focus on what it is your app actually does mostly
[56:53.120 --> 56:58.240]  You know think about the app itself as opposed to having to worry about the back end and all this back end engineering
[56:59.280 --> 57:01.060]  You'll get your thing built faster
[57:01.060 --> 57:06.920]  You'll be able to parlay off our expertise at keeping these back end services up and running with a very, you know
[57:07.320 --> 57:09.320]  high performance high reliability
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.880]  Mm-hmm, and then and all of a sudden now the one thing that I have seen a lot of people say about parts
[57:15.880 --> 57:22.360]  Is that okay? It sucks that Facebook is shutting it down, but that when Facebook shuts when it's something like this down
[57:22.360 --> 57:27.720]  They do it better than anybody else. And I think they've I think it's like a year from now when they're yeah one year
[57:28.240 --> 57:30.240]  Which you know?
[57:30.520 --> 57:36.080]  Isn't good news to anybody out there who wasn't you know whose plans for their app that is currently using it
[57:36.720 --> 57:41.660]  Didn't have any kind of allocation for let's spend seven months rewriting the back end
[57:41.660 --> 57:49.620]  In 2016 and now all of a sudden that's sort of they have to but it's a heck of a lot better than
[57:49.940 --> 57:55.820]  It's going away April 1st or something like that, which is how some of these things go down. Oh, yeah
[57:55.820 --> 58:00.820]  Yeah, like actually a lot of recently a lot of web services
[58:00.860 --> 58:06.100]  There's been a variety of them run by the Giants that have decided that they're no longer
[58:06.100 --> 58:10.860]  You know necessary and they're they're shut down within a couple of weeks and like, you know
[58:10.860 --> 58:13.740]  Really quickly and it's it makes people jumpy
[58:13.740 --> 58:19.140]  I mean, there's it makes developers that talk to really really really jumpy like why should we use any of this stuff?
[58:19.140 --> 58:22.040]  You know if if we don't know where it's gonna be
[58:22.180 --> 58:28.140]  so any I mean along with the long the roundabout route there was Facebook has to deal with very similar issues to Apple when it
[58:28.140 --> 58:29.380]  comes to
[58:29.380 --> 58:34.080]  Creating a hospitable environment because I think you're absolutely correct in that, you know
[58:34.080 --> 58:40.900]  a lot of apples continued success is based on them being hospitable to the next big thing and then their platform being
[58:41.620 --> 58:43.380]  welcoming and and
[58:43.380 --> 58:48.020]  You know people seeing as a desirable place to be and so far they're good there
[58:48.020 --> 58:54.580]  But you know, you can't you can't count on that being forever because that's when you end up in trouble and and end up
[58:54.580 --> 58:56.580]  End up slipping. Yeah
[58:57.940 --> 59:00.620]  What did you think of like I
[59:00.620 --> 59:06.700]  I thought that the Apple's whole earnings like the phone call especially was it was weird
[59:06.700 --> 59:13.660]  I thought because and it's because it was inevitably weird because I think Apple knew exactly how well the news and numbers they had
[59:13.660 --> 59:18.760]  We're going to play out which was not well, but on the other hand, they're not going to
[59:21.460 --> 59:27.460]  The spin on it is was a very tricky dance because they're not gonna sit there and apologize for having right the
[59:27.460 --> 59:32.340]  Most profit of the best quarter of any company ever right a record for themselves
[59:33.940 --> 59:35.540]  And
[59:35.540 --> 59:39.380]  the most profit of any company that anybody's ever had and
[59:40.660 --> 59:45.440]  Reasonably, you know part of the spin was the very very reasonable to me
[59:46.060 --> 59:48.620]  argument that a big part of the reason why it was
[59:49.140 --> 59:51.140]  almost flat year-over-year
[59:51.140 --> 59:58.720]  Was the currency exchange problems that they had around the world and that with the you know incredible
[59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.920]  Amount of sales they have now that there's you know
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.720]  Definitely not a u.s
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:09.480]  only company like they used to be in the old days that they sell tons throughout Europe and China is this huge growing market and
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.480]  Japan is a big market
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:17.120]  But that basically the dollar US dollar is so strong that they you know
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.300]  They've had to raise prices around the world just to try to keep even and that they lost somewhere around eight
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.080]  billion dollars in
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.080]  currency exchange for the quarter
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.440]  But it's you know, let's face it they're making excuses for
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.240]  You know that they're trying to put it in the best possible light the other thing that they came up with
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.280]  And it's interesting. I'm not saying that it's pointless
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.000]  I'm not saying it's an empty number
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.220]  But it's I'm curious about what do you think about it? Because I'm still not sure is they came up with this new number
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.920]  monthly active devices
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.400]  mm-hmm and that they said that
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.960]  You know that from the tracking that they can do of you know, when you opt into hey
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:06.320]  Will you allow Apple to you know, see you know what you're doing on your device that there they now estimate that there's 1 billion
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.800]  active devices
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.760]  iPhones iPads Macs, I guess watches get counted in that
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.520]  That's not a billion people it's clearly they're emphasizing
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.440]  You know that it's devices and that an awful lot of you know
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:28.720]  The company's success is the fact that there are people like like the people who listen to the show who have an iPhone and iPad
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.720]  And Mac or maybe two Macs
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.040]  So a billion devices is definitely not a billion people
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:43.160]  But it's an interesting number nonetheless compared to the number of people in the world, which is what like around seven billion. Mm-hmm
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.480]  Yeah, I don't know what to make of it either I mean, I think it's I
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.200]  think it's definitely a
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:57.960]  More accurate number than number of devices sold total or not more accurate but more interesting, right?
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:04.440]  because the number of devices sold does not include of course devices that have been put into a a
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.920]  Drawer and and you know ignored or whatever. So they're signaling that this is how many people this is your addressable market
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.640]  That's the signal right? So the signal to
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.200]  anybody in the Apple ecosystem and a signal to any investor is
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.320]  You know that wants to buy Apple stock or whatever is that this is their addressable market and that addressable market
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.320]  It has two sort of
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.320]  Components one
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.520]  accessory makers app developers anybody in the external
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.320]  ecosystem
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.000]  Can look at that and go. Oh, well, this is how many people we can hope to
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.440]  sell to directly and then the other aspect of it is is that Apple says is saying
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.600]  These this is how many people we can sell anything new we make to right?
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:03.760]  these are the people that are actively already using it that are have bought into the Apple way of doing things and
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.600]  are
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.680]  Willing to buy the things that we make
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:14.720]  And that is a growth signal and that's the kind of thing that they're trying to counteract is this feeling that
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:22.040]  Apple can't grow anymore, right that doesn't have any room to grow that and that is to me. That's exactly why they've
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.520]  Introduced this number. I mean part of it is that they hit the nice even 1 billion
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.800]  So it makes it like it's somewhat adds to the here's why we're gonna bring this up
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:39.300]  But if they track this every quarter, it's a way to show growth that takes into account
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:45.820]  The fact that people buy a lot of Apple's products and use them until they break
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.700]  Which to me is a large part of the why are the iPad numbers?
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.360]  lower than they were at the in its heyday and
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.080]  I really do and a lot of this is based on just the anecdotal evidence of what I see in the people in my extended
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.040]  Family doing with their iPads, which is using them until they break
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.100]  And that's when they go to buy another iPad because all of the things that they bought the iPad for
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.760]  You know, we can focus on all the new features like retina displays and touch ID
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.360]  And the pen the pencil for the iPad Pro or whatever
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:30.720]  Whereas everybody I know, you know bought it to do email and play candy crush and watch videos or us
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.580]  You know a lot of people, you know my age
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:39.440]  You know my generation who have kids to have it to give to kids to watch videos and stuff like that on
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.160]  But no matter which iPad you have it's it if it still is working
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:50.200]  It still does all of those things as good as it did when it started and I really feel like this monthly active device
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.200]  Thing is a number that can keep
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.640]  Should keep growing even in a quarter where the year-over-year
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.120]  number of iPhone sold is
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.400]  Not showing a lot of growth
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.280]  Right, right. Yeah, that makes sense because they can say look, you know, people are keeping them, but they're still using them
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.280]  You know, so even if we didn't sell quite as many there's still a ton of devices on our platform
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.840]  So when those do break we're gonna get those sales and that sort of thing
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:24.200]  So it's a recurring revenue versus a new revenue thing, but see that Wall Street is really obsessed with growth, right?
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.200]  They based them they base their
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.520]  stock
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:34.360]  Prices on future revenue not current, you know, like congrats you did amazing, but we don't care like that's their attitude, right?
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.660]  And it's like what could you do for me in the future? Not what have you done for me?
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.040]  Man, that's just the nature of the beast. You know, it's the way it works
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.160]  So I think that Apple is going to have a very interesting story to tell
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.800]  Because this this is one of those really funny
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.880]  I guess it depends on who you who you are whether it's funny or not
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.760]  but it's sort of funny in a really macabre way to me, but Apple actually
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.800]  looks less valuable to Wall Street because its products are built better and
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.080]  work better and
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:14.260]  Don't need to be replaced as much because they are still quite functional even even several generations down the line
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.240]  Whereas you know one one generation or two, you know an Android device is
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.560]  usually unless it's the really really well-built one is
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.760]  Disposable, you know and that's being generous
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.800]  So I think that it's it's a funny situation where it's like oh your company is not worth as much
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.480]  Because you build your products too well, and I find that really really amusing but I'm sure Apple doesn't find it as amusing
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.200]  No, I don't think so either and if you really think about it deeply
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.440]  It's it really is it's the conflict of short-term
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.720]  Interest which Wall Street infamously is focused on hyper focused on is what do you do?
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.960]  You know then just looking three months ahead at a time three months three months three months as opposed to looking
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.920]  You know at years or even decades of building loyal customer relationships
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.080]  Building
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.240]  iPhones that are reliable enough and wear and tear well enough
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:16.720]  That people can that maybe extend the two-year that cycle and maybe only buy every three or four years and have
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.440]  Reasonably good experiences right up until the end when they do it is
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.040]  Great for the customer relation between Apple and I and our customers where their customers thinking I'm getting great value for this
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.080]  Because look I bought this three or four years ago, and I'm now only replacing it now
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.720]  And it's not great if you're looking for her
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.760]  Record-breaking quarters after quarter. No, right
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:46.040]  Yeah, it's it's a sickest sucky situation to be in which is maybe why we're seeing these new metrics and seeing some dances
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.560]  with with those numbers, I mean the I was I was laughing cuz
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.140]  Before the I mean when the before the call when that because the the earnings drop
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:03.940]  Several minutes before the call about 30 minutes before the call usually and you'll get a you get some time to kind of pour over
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.020]  The numbers and you know publish whatever you want to about the basic numbers of the situation
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.140]  but during that space
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.060]  We noticed that somebody tweeted it at me and I can't remember who I apologize at this moment
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.260]  But they said it was the first time that they can remember seeing
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:24.020]  Supplemental materials attached to the report that were specifically about currency headwinds
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.900]  Yeah foreign exchange and problems and and that it I mean, it's true
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:34.060]  They've mentioned Forex for several years now as a major factor in why their profits haven't looked quite as good
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:42.220]  Because you know the right there essentially what they said is like $100 today or $80 $100 in 2014
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.320]  It's $85 today. So that's a significant portion, you know
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:50.000]  It's an enormous chunk of of money that just disappears a profit that disappears for them
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.880]  but I laugh because like they started the call and and
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:02.080]  Was less there's two sentences in and they mentioned currency headwinds as a factor. So it's a huge deal for them because
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.440]  those numbers those growth numbers are what they can base future growth on and
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.120]  People go. Yeah. Yeah, but it doesn't matter to Apple
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.440]  They have so much cash in a bank and blah blah blah and that is true like to to a large degree
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.680]  I mean Apple does not really care about what Wall Street values its stock at in general
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.960]  And that isn't really if the CEO's job is it's not to maximize the stock price
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.720]  although lots of people think that is it's not actually true and
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:40.000]  The thing the factor the big issue with that happening is not the immediate
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.520]  Oh apples in trouble with Wall Street, you know, Nina Nina
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:49.400]  It's Apple's hiring and retention of employees is largely based on stock
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.080]  Because Apple does not pay very well. I mean they pay well, I shouldn't say that that's unfair
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.520]  They pay fairly but they don't pay
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:05.120]  Exorbitant sum it's not commensurate, you know that Apple's average salary is not commensurate to Apple's corporate average
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:11.940]  Profits which are extraordinary Apple's profits are truly extraordinary. They are literally the most profitable company right now
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:14.760]  I mean who knows how long that'll last but at the moment
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:21.400]  They're the most profitable come from company in the world their average salary to engineers and regular talent is is not
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.720]  Correct, and so that compensation that additional compensation whatever you want to call it
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.080]  Has to come from the stock. So people they go. Hey, you know, here's a
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.560]  Very, you know nice maybe even better than average stock compensation
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:46.640]  Plan for you to offset the fact that we don't pay crazy Google engineer
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:51.520]  Rates, you know and that I think is it's gonna hurt them
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.960]  So that's why they care so much about this stuff and why they're trying to communicate so much to
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.320]  Besides the fact that yeah, of course, you want to have a good earnings report, you know
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.480]  They're not saying forget the stock who cares
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:07.620]  it's just that's the most important thing to them because Apple faces an enormous amount of competition against
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:13.740]  The I mean up until what was very recently an extremely favorable funding environment
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:19.420]  And it's still much better than it has been in years and years. So an engineer a talented one says hey
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:25.420]  Why don't I just become a technical founder of my own company and and build it or scale it to whatever and sell it?
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:30.620]  For millions or whatever the case why should I go work to Apple or go to work at Apple instead?
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.620]  well, why don't I just start my own company or
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:38.220]  Why don't I go to one of these companies that are offering just an insane retention or acquisition?
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.660]  Package for engineers because they absolutely must have engineers, you know
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:48.420]  It's one of the most competitive hiring environments in in the history of ever for engineers
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:56.180]  so that's gonna hurt their ability to hire and retain and that's that's I think the big reason they're trying to to
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:02.900]  communicate this these growth this growth potential to to Wall Street in such an aggressive way
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:08.340]  yeah, I definitely agree and it does I think I think that that is the the connection to
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.540]  Retention and a tension of existing talent and
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:21.220]  Attracting the new talent that they need. It's absolutely the way that the stock price most directly affects the way Apple is is
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500]  Managed in the short term
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:32.240]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's like the difference between you know, Apple employee buying a bicycle or a Porsche, you know
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.180]  That's what the difference is between
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.280]  The stock price a year ago and the stock price now, you know what I mean?
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.240]  So it's it's not it's pretty substantial and yeah, no, you know
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.380]  It's not like I'm saying everybody needs a sports car
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.820]  But it does when you when you look at it in the aggregate
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:52.620]  You're gonna you have a certain value as an engineer and that value is really high right now
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:58.020]  And so Apple's, you know got to got to play in that same field as everybody else
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:04.340]  It's either that or they start spending cash just flat-out cash on on hiring people and paying them a lot of a lot of money
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.340]  And that's never the way they've hired
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.800]  But it is a question about whether or not they may have to start. Yeah
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:17.380]  Yeah, and I wonder I feel like they're if they needed to to go that route they could
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.880]  and part
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.140]  part of the reason why is that they make high-margin
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.860]  relatively low-volume
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:32.900]  Products meaning low-volume even the iPhone which is the most successful product anybody's ever had in the whole industry
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.340]  It still is not famously
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:40.220]  I mean nobody really talks about anymore because it's everybody's sort of gotten it pounded through their heads that it doesn't really matter but
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:46.260]  Isn't the majority of smartphones, you know that Android as a whole and the aggregate outsells the iPhone
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:52.040]  Mm-hmm. It's just that each one is, you know, very high average selling price, etc
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:58.800]  Etc and that as so Apple it they they sell enough of them that the scale is there that they can pay
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.960]  You know, it's not quite that they need to hire engineers at a one-to-one ratio with the number of devices they sell
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.920]  Yeah, yeah, I mean right now they're so
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:16.720]  They actually I mean, you know, they have turnover like everybody else, but they're they're so packed right now
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.380]  Like I've heard all the buildings like to do a desk, you know stuff like that
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.160]  Like they're they're really like their amount of real estate
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.960]  They have a lot of people hired and packed in there, which is why they're building this new
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.640]  You know headquarters and they're already planning another big building
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:37.180]  Yeah, because it's just like they're growing they've grown like crazy on the back of iPhone growth, you know
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.000]  I think that they don't want to say it. They just don't I mean, it's just cuz it's
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.660]  Not embarrassing, but they don't want to put a negative spin on something like the new campus still isn't even finished
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.640]  They haven't had a grand opening yet and they want the grand opening to be like this great
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:56.180]  celebration of look at this beautiful building and all these great features, but I really do feel like the
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:01.940]  Fundamental truth is they underestimated vastly underestimated the size that the new headquarters should be
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:07.580]  Mm-hmm that they if they knew then what they know now
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:14.900]  Like if Tim Cook and could send back a message to his, you know at the point where they were committing to break ground
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.420]  You know, what was that around 2010?
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.460]  2011 whenever that was like when Steve Jobs was going still
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:25.620]  Going before like the Cupertino City Council and whatever
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:31.860]  If they could go back and just maybe like make some changes to the blueprints. They'd add a lot of space
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:37.940]  Because yeah, I know they probably double the size to be honest my basic
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:42.200]  I I what I've heard and I I wouldn't be surprised if it's changed
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.760]  Even since I've last talked to somebody about it, but basically they're not closing anything, you know
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.420]  they're opening this new campus and they plan to fill the whole thing up and
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:58.300]  all of the existing campus space that they have is going to continue being used that and just imagine how
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.900]  Imagine how crowded they must be at that point at this point
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.500]  Yeah, yeah, cuz all every and they've bought a bunch of real estate
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.860]  I mean almost all of you know, Cupertino
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:13.840]  it's like Apple now, but they they bought us so much space and if all of that is being used and all of the
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:19.700]  New capacity is being used. That's just you know, that's just steady, right?
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.980]  And obviously they're a growing company that has to hire. So yeah, they're gonna be they're gonna be hurting for space pretty quick. Yeah
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.700]  All right, let me take another break here and think our next sponsor and we come back
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.500]  I want to talk about another company that had a
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:38.160]  Probably the worst week than Apple in terms of what the earnings did to the stock and that's Amazon
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.580]  But I want to take a moment now and thank Warby Parker
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.020]  Warby Parker makes buying glasses online easy and risk-free
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:54.220]  Where do you go you go to Warby Parker comm slash the talk show and you can order your free?
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:17:00.980]  Home try-ons today. They have contemporary eyeglasses that are extremely affordable very fashionable
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:08.580]  If they make their glasses are inexpensive enough that you can definitely treat them like an accessory in terms of
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.020]  You can have multiple pairs. You don't have to think like I have one pair of glasses you can go and
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:20.220]  And their regular prescription glasses start at just $95 which includes the prescription lenses
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.540]  And they don't nickel-and-dime you on coatings and stuff like that
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:31.260]  You get really good lenses the lenses that you would want for just 95 bucks. They have a titanium collection. That's just
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:38.100]  149 or 145 including again including the prescription lenses and premium Japanese titanium
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:46.660]  Really nice French non-rocking screws really really good stuff. They also have non-prescription sunglasses so even if you don't need
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:53.580]  Prescription glasses if you just want to get a really nice pair of sunglasses you can go there for that too all of their glasses
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:18:00.820]  Conclude anti-reflective anti-glare coatings. They don't upsell you on those things you just get it for free excellent hard case
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:07.860]  I really do that the Warby Parker glasses cases are excellent really great a nice cleaning cloth all of that stuff

[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.580]  with the glasses
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:17.760]  Now buying glasses online sounds tricky because it seems like the sort of thing that's definitely sort of thing you want to try them
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:23.420]  On before you buy well they let you do that you go there you pick five up to five pairs of glasses that you want
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.140]  to evaluate and
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:28.940]  They send them to you free of charge, and it comes in like two or three days
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.940]  You get a box as all five of them laid out
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.780]  Try them on at home, and they've just got you know regular clear
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:39.380]  Non-prescription lenses, and I'm you just try them on look in the mirror. See how you look which ones you like
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.780]  And see if they're comfortable
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.760]  And you pick the one you want you send it back you go online and just say here's the one I want
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.660]  and
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.580]  Within I don't know it's like a week or so they arrived to you
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.140]  I just ordered a new pair myself about a week ago
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.540]  It took about a week from when I said here's the ones I want to where I got them
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:05.100]  Could not be easier everything and even the box to send them back comes with a label pre pre-printed
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.740]  You just close the box put a piece of tape on it and just stick the sticker
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:14.220]  They've already given it to you this to give it to the UPS or FedEx guy or whatever could not be easier

[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.380]  So my thanks to warby parker
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.300]  All right Amazon so Amazon I don't understand what happened to Amazon
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:39.940]  Because Amazon announced record-breaking revenue
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:46.380]  And I forget you know there are a couple places that track online stuff that estimated that over the holiday quarter Amazon did
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.300]  51% of all the online shopping at least in in America
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:58.380]  so they've actually reached the point where they've they've they take up an a majority of online shopping and
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.700]  Everybody I know
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.140]  Uses Amazon more than they've ever used it before
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:11.780]  We just buy ridiculous stuff from Amazon now right like we've we've got we you know everybody laugh, but we got those clickers
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.820]  hearing that the
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:19.820]  Gruber house we've got one now for the detergent so like when when we're doing laundry if you run low on detergent
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.420]  You just click your little button and mm-hmm and a couple days later some tide shows up
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.940]  and
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:33.220]  But because their profits were lower than I guess they guess the gist is okay their revenues up
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.340]  But their profits were lower than expected their stock took
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:40.940]  I mean like a bath like like a 10% just cut right off the top
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:46.420]  Mm-hmm I'm looking as we record. We're recording after the closing markets on Friday here
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:53.460]  Amazon for the day was down seven and a half percent on a day when the market as a whole was up
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.620]  about 2.5%
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:03.540]  So you know compared to the market they more or less lost 10% today, which is crazy because to me
[01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.100]  revenue going way way up and
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:12.440]  Profit missing the mark. That's the Amazon way like who are these people who were invested in Amazon who?
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.040]  Who haven't noticed that that's the way Amazon rolls?
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.680]  Yeah
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.480]  So here's my don't know I wonder if we've reached the point where maybe
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:30.760]  You know and I realize that arguments that the market is sensible. You know and has some kind of collective logic to it
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:34.680]  You know the mr. Market argument, but I just wonder if maybe we reach the point where mr.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:40.080]  Market is sick of waiting for Amazon to have consistent profits and that the Amazon doesn't need to be profitable
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.600]  Part of Amazon in its history is coming to a close
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.040]  Yeah
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.040]  Interesting one. I mean it's a that's been a major question for a while
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.680]  It's like it a is Amazon even capable of doing it like flipping some magical switch and becoming profitable
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.480]  And then B. When is the when do investors get tired of waiting right?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.540]  And the the you know, Jeff Bezos has always been very upfront about what they're doing
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:11.080]  Which is investing almost every penny back in the company and into growth and that is their plan
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.460]  They want to become the biggest at everything they do
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:20.200]  And investors have bought in right because he's he's charismatic and the company has done well and growth. It hasn't missed
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.400]  Those targets like it tends to to grow the way it grows
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:27.020]  And what on a very predictable?
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:32.080]  level for many many years, but I mean like if you look at like every quarter since
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.760]  like late 2014 the the
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:41.800]  Estimated earnings has been incorrect like the EPS earnings per share has been wrong
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:50.000]  slightly low actually every year whether it was a loss or gain because Amazon is actually they marked a loss in like q1 of
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.120]  2015 but
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.720]  EPS wise but they a negative EPS
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.520]  But investors have always sort of like underestimated and in like the holiday quarter
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.340]  They wildly like wildly overestimated like by like 50% how much?
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:10.720]  they thought Amazon was gonna make and it's I
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.880]  Don't know why maybe it's just like everybody got like hopped up on holiday juice and decided
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:21.520]  Oh Amazon is gonna just make so much money because it's Christmas and blah blah blah
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:27.520]  but that mean this, you know, I don't know they seem pretty upfront about their their plans so
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.760]  Whether people are tired of it or not tired of it
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:36.200]  I don't know if Amazon's gonna change that strategy a whole lot. I mean, I guess people could force them to
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.800]  By severely undervaluing their stock, but I don't know. I don't I don't I don't foresee that going anywhere
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.880]  It really seemed to me like an Apple like stock adjustment
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:51.840]  you know where in terms of it being what ought to be a very stable stock because they're
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.340]  Either huge or big company. They've been around for a while
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:00.580]  But be there there to me pretty easily understood
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:06.620]  This is Amazon and Apple and what they announced it maybe not be the best news you've ever heard
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:13.480]  But it shouldn't affect the stock at like 10% of the market cap and that and that type of volatility
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.460]  Like this is not
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:21.620]  Volley a volatile surprise that they've announced this should be you know, maybe a little bit down
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:28.300]  It just seems like it's it's almost it's almost shocking how volatile a stock can be even when the news that they're announcing
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.020]  To me isn't surprising in the least bit
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.780]  Mm-hmm
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:37.140]  yeah, and I think some of it could be that
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.740]  There is a there's a way that people are looking that analysts or or
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:49.860]  The people whose job it is to watch the market are looking at Amazon that's different now
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.800]  But I don't think that Amazon looks at itself differently, you know
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:59.060]  I don't you know, I think they're just they're as far as they're concerned. They're just staying the course
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.900]  There was you know, there's some interesting math
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:05.040]  I think Jason del Rey at Rico did this math and I thought it was a clever way of looking at it
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.500]  But he was saying that Amazon has at least 46 million prime members worldwide
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:16.340]  Yeah at this point and I thought that he did a little bit of press the digitization with Amazon's very very nebulous
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:20.700]  Numbers because he has hunts famous for never gave me exact numbers anything
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:28.280]  They don't absolutely have to by law, but he'd be kind of back of the napkin about 46 million at least 46 million prime members
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.540]  But it could be more
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:35.260]  And I think that that number is a really key indicator. It's a really really interesting indicator of Amazon's
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:41.440]  Philosophy which is if you are a member of Amazon your life is easier
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.400]  Right, like that's what they want people to buy into that's what they're selling
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.640]  They're not selling individual products or or services
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.240]  They're selling this idea that oh if you're a prime member
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:26:00.440]  The benefits that you get are so wide and varied that you'd be dumb not to you know, you'd just be stupid not to
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:08.200]  Right, and it's just one membership and you don't have to sign up for Amazon video and you don't have to sign up for Amazon
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.620]  books and
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:12.180]  Amazon
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:17.000]  Groceries you just sign up for Amazon Prime and you get all of this stuff and maybe you signed up for Amazon Prime
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.700]  primarily just to get as much free shipping as you can on
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.840]  Books and
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.500]  Miscellaneous physical things that you buy from Amazon and have shipped to your house
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.780]  So you don't have to go out to a store and buy it but that the ancillary of the benefit of hey
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.800]  all these different devices you've got like whatever brand phone it is in your pocket and
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.160]  most set-top boxes
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.960]  Like your TV or whatever just go over and just click on the Amazon thing now and sign in with the same ID and you're
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  Gonna have all of this stuff that you can just watch
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.440]  You just watch it for you know, just it's it's just there, you know and including original, you know programming
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:00.920]  I think it's a very compelling story and I really think that it's a remarkably
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:08.200]  Um self-aware company like I feel like Amazon it's starting from Jeff Bezos on down
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.480]  They know exactly who they are what they want to be doing and even you know
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.520]  They're missteps even the mistake, you know things they made that didn't really take off to me
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:23.860]  They were very reasonable tries, you know, like the the phone the fire phone. I totally reasonable thing for them to have tried
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.640]  I
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:31.800]  Would almost say sort of like with Facebook and some of the individual sub apps, you know little mini apps that they've made
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.480]  That didn't really take off but they were worthwhile experiments and that maybe there are things that they could learn
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.800]  That you know go into the Facebook dot app itself same way with Amazon in the fire phone
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.760]  Like the fact that that was a real a real disaster in terms of how successful it was
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.040]  I don't it's not like they put any any kind of effort into that that hurt them anywhere else
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:58.560]  And if it had taken off if they'd figured out a way to make it click that could have been a great idea
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.320]  Yeah, I remember I was at the finish the first Kindle
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.120]  Fire tablet announcement and it was like an airplane hangar in LA or something
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:19.240]  Or some event space on near an airport and I was I was sitting there and they were showing all these charts with no numbers
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.280]  On them bases bases charts, right bases charts
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:27.320]  Yeah, exactly and like, you know, oh this is Amazon was here and now it's here and you know
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.760]  A lot of really context-free stuff and I was kind of zoning out
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.800]  but I
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:36.100]  We kind of had an inkling that what they were going to announce and kind of the basic thing and I was and I was
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.360]  thinking to myself like if if they
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.880]  Do this, right? It's just
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.020]  like a single a single account with access to just
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:54.520]  Everything like everything you could possibly want in your life. I mean, that's that's really really powerful
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:54.800]  I mean
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.080]  This is what Apple has been trying to build
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.920]  piece by piece with iCloud and
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:04.400]  That just Amazon had a lot of the other stuff that Apple didn't they were just coming to the same place from opposite ends
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.720]  Of the spectrum and I thought that was a really valid thought to have you know
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.500]  A really valid effort to make as you mentioned to to kind of get there from their position
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:21.760]  whereas Apple's coming from a hardware maker and getting into the middle where it's hardware and cloud working together and
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.720]  Amazon's coming from the cloud side and doing the same thing
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.720]  because they both companies saw very well that that is the future of everything is that
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:37.620]  If you have a device that does not provide you access to everything that you need in your digital, you know
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.620]  Life on a server in the Midwest somewhere
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:47.240]  Then it's just an empty shell. It's a husk and as far as Amazon is concerned the
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:54.420]  The jelly filling is the important part and Apple as far as Apple's concern the doughnut is the important part, right?
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:30:00.300]  And so they they just have differing philosophies as to what the the mate the major-minor is
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.900]  But they're going to the same place a jelly filled doughnut, you know
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:10.220]  and I think that there's plenty to still explore there and I really like even I know like
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.620]  Amazon has scaled back their
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.780]  their labs a lot their hardware labs and and kind of
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:23.220]  Rejiggered and move things around and there's been a lot of I've talked a lot of people who have come out of there and said
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.380]  It was like they were trying to run like an amazing innovation lab like a Johnny
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:34.180]  I've designed studio but they were trying to run it with Amazon efficiencies like you pay for your own parking and like, you know stuff like
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.920]  That like crappy desks and whatnot, you know
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:44.860]  Your desk is made out of a door, right? Exactly. Exactly and like I you know, okay, whatever you're gonna everybody's got their own style
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:49.420]  But I just don't think that worked really well for that type of environment, you know, sometimes it matters
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:52.460]  You know how you feel about where you work not just what you're doing
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:57.980]  But regardless, I think that I would not be surprised for them to take another stab at that
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:02.380]  You know to kind of come at it again from a slightly different angle
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:07.100]  To say look this thing is just a portal in the Amazon
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:12.380]  The specs don't even matter because they were like really we're talking all kind of look at this, you know
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:16.820]  You're getting this for this they were high on the value right which is a very Amazon thing
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:22.280]  You're getting this processor and this RAM for this much money. It's just it's half the price of our competitors or whatever
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:28.100]  Right, and I just don't think that people care that much and I don't think it matters, you know
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:34.220]  It's just this is a thing that gets you all of your stuff. That's it. That's all that matters. I think that there's
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.800]  That Amazon's an erasing comparison to Apple too in terms of the Bezos charts
[01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:46.340]  And that for as secretive as Apple is about its future products and they are famously, you know
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:50.780]  The most secretive company in the industry when it comes to what they're working on or at least they try to be
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:57.140]  Historically, they're actually there what they what they've released and what they continue to release in their
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.100]  Quarterly financial statements is actually pretty open
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:05.980]  But that's what makes the fact that they set it in advance so that it wouldn't come as a surprise
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.100]  But that they're not going to release sales figures for Apple watch
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:17.340]  Different and I can't help but think that part of it is that they look at Amazon and the fact that Amazon doesn't really doesn't
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:23.340]  Break anything down. They just see here's our revenue. Here's our profit and they'll say where some things are up or whatever
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:25.340]  But they don't announce, you know
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.820]  Actual they don't put actual numbers on the charts. I
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:34.060]  Can't help but think that Apple's executive team looks at that and says boy. That would be nice. I
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.820]  Think it would be the amazing scenario for them to be like, I don't know we'd like we sold the most ever yeah
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:47.940]  That's the most ever the most they did with the watch. Yeah, that's exactly what they did with the watch
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.940]  They did we sold the most watches ever
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:55.800]  How many the most ever oh good great excellent they did a good job keep it up
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.820]  Yeah, I mean I think that they do get a hold of different standards I
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:09.040]  I think the Amazon sort of set themselves up for that but never ever ever entertaining the numbers thing
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:14.440]  But I also think that because of the expectations people have for Amazon growth aka
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.860]  Huge revenue growth but flatline profits, you know, I think somebody tweeted like
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.660]  Him or her was maybe Matthew Iglesias to be a chart from the Financial Times
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.760]  I think I saw it cuz it's only week. I say we tweeted it, but
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.840]  It's like he did Matthew the case. This is a I love this chart and it was just
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:39.960]  the the profits is a pink line that just dribbles along the bottom near zero like
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:46.100]  My zero and then the revenue is just like whoops straight up to a hundred, you know, right in the millions
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:52.520]  I guess but it's it's pretty crazy that they are able to get away with that, but it is about positioning
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.960]  All right. It's about setting yourself up and in this long-term story that
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.880]  Amazon feels and thinks of itself as a young company as a like we're just getting started
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.360]  We're like, we're just starting to get into like
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.800]  Our teen years, you know
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.400]  I mean like they're they're raring to go and this is just beginning and like all of that is is message externally internally and
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.120]  You know, it's sort of like the stay hungry thing, right? You know, we don't want to feel
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.160]  Complacent or whatever, but it also allows them to
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.600]  Maybe excuse is the wrong word
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:33.400]  But I'm gonna use it allows them to excuse that particular differential between their growth and profits by saying look we're in our growth face
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.640]  We don't yet serve every person on earth
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.440]  We're in our growth phase, you know
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:44.000]  and I think that that's a very very interesting thing for them to be able to get away with and it's
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.480]  100% unique in that the lexicon of tech companies out there
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.040]  Well said
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.760]  Let me take this break and and thank our third and final sponsor of the show. It's our good friends at Casper
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.800]  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:07.720]  That they sell for a fraction of the price of the mainstream competitors when you go into a regular mattress store
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:15.000]  The mattress industry has inherently forced customers into paying notoriously high markups for incredibly
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.200]  confusing lineups of mattresses
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:22.760]  they do all sorts of things that regular mattress companies do these things where if you go into mattress store a and you make a
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.160]  List of like the three mattresses from the company that you're interested in and then you go to another store to see if you can compare
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.480]  The prices the mattresses have different names, even though they're like the same thing as in another store
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.600]  They sell each one to each retailer with different names to purposefully make it hard to compare
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:42.520]  Really really just a rotten rotten practice and it's a real pain in the ass to buy a mattress
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:50.840]  Casper is trying to revolutionize the mattress industry by just doing it a completely direct and completely
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.240]  Non-confusing way so they sell direct number one that cuts the price of the mattress
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.980]  Dramatically because you buy it right from them. You don't go to a retailer and there's no
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.440]  Wholesale, you know markup or anything like that the quality
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.240]  Casper's mattresses provide
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.200]  resilience long-lasting support comfort and
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:18.880]  It's you don't have to choose from like a confusing array of what type of mattress you want. They've made one type of mattress
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:25.780]  It's a hybrid mattress that combines premium latex foam with memory foam and it gives you what they call just the right
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.980]  bounce just the right sink it's
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:33.860]  And and and in a way that you're never gonna be able to tell by just laying on a mattress in a retail store for
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.940]  30 seconds and saying I guess it feels good. This is a mattress that's been engineered to give you a great night's sleep
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:46.780]  Trust mattress experts right you normal people buy a mattress once every I don't know five years ten years something like that
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:50.700]  How are you gonna become an expert at buying a mattress if that's how often you try them out?
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.660]  These are engineers who they've like devoted their life. They've got, you know mattress engineers
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.820]  Casper let them just do it for you
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:05.000]  Regular mattresses often cost well over $1,500 Casper mattresses. Here's their prices
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:13.540]  $500 for a twin size 600 for a twin XL 750 for full 850 for Queen and just 950 bucks for a king-size mattress
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:19.740]  Now they definitely understand that buying a mattress online can have customers wondering how that's even possible
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:24.420]  number one because they build them out of these this this combination of
[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:32.460]  Latex foam and memory foam they can pack the mattress into what for a mattress is a remarkably small box. So shipping
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.940]  They don't ship mattress sized boxes
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.620]  They ship these little sort of dorm room refrigerator
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.940]  size boxes
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:43.460]  Shows up your at your house you put it in a room where you want it you open it up according the instructions and then
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.980]  It just sucks air in from your room and all of a sudden it goes from being this little box to being a mattress
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:53.800]  It's completely risk-free. So number one shipping is easy
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.300]  You don't have to worry about it. Number two. What if you don't actually like it?
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:01.440]  What if you listen to me and tell you that it's just the right sink just the right bounce and then you get this in
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.380]  Your bedroom and you're like this doesn't have the right sink doesn't have the right bounce. I don't like it
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.140]  They give you a hundred day period where if you don't like it
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:15.660]  They'll just take it away for free free return get all your money back. No questions asked
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:19.900]  No hard sell up to a hundred days you got that's over three months
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:26.340]  Where you can just sleep on it every night and decide whether you actually like it and whether it's actually as good a mattress
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:30.780]  As I'm telling you that it is I think in the when they first started sponsoring a show
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:36.580]  That was like a lower number like 60 days or something like that and they've upped it to a hundred days because that's how few
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:39.000]  People were sending back these mattresses. So
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:43.760]  Here's what you get. This is just win-win-win all around you get a great mattress
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.880]  You save tons of time versus going out and buying one in retail. It's way easier to have delivered
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.120]  And you have no risk
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:58.000]  So you get a great mattress at a great price and you save lots of time and you have no risk so you can't lose
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.120]  last but not least
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:04.040]  Casper mattresses are made in America right here in the United States
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:12.080]  so where do you go to find out more go to casper.com slash the talk show casper.com slash the talk show and
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.120]  Just by using that link you will get 50 bucks towards any mattress you purchase
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.480]  So you'll save money and I'll know you came from the show at casper.com slash the talk show
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.560]  Anything else you want to talk about before we talk about our bourbon collections
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.840]  You know one thing we didn't talk about with Amazon is the echo which I think is actually super
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.040]  important to them
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:43.120]  Maybe not, you know, like monetarily yet, but I think it's actually very very Amazon II
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.320]  Have you played with that thing at all? No, I haven't I cuz you had to sign up for it
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.540]  And I get on a list and I didn't feel like doing that and now I wish I had because I wish I had one
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean it's
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.880]  The the integrations are starting to really kick into gear now like you you know, if it works with it so you can tell
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:04.720]  Alexa which is the
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:10.520]  Assistant name if they've chosen these are all women. Why are they all women? They're all women in America. It's actually different
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:15.520]  It's actually a I'll have to find the link but it's actually interesting real thing. It's a cultural thing around the world
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.000]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, interesting. Yeah, I'll look at that. That sounds interesting
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.280]  Yeah, Sonia you tell her hey, you know turn off my lights
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.400]  Read me the news whatever like the news thing
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.000]  I think is even built into Amazon's thing
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.320]  but if the external external integrations are growing like you're just seeing a larger and our larger number of
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:41.160]  External apps or hardware supporting it so you can just basically, you know computer
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.160]  Read me the news or computer
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:45.760]  What temperature is it?
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.360]  you know things like that and I think that that's a pretty compelling use case and
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:56.320]  The hey Siri thing obviously in the iPhone is Apple's approach to that and then Amazon doesn't have
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.320]  Obviously, they don't have a fire phone in every home so they can't do that
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.520]  So they had to go this route and it's sort of like an ordering thing
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.620]  You can order of course stuff from Amazon with it
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:13.140]  And then you can ask it things just seems like a really really cool thing
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:19.360]  Obviously, there's tons of creep factor too, but it seems like a really cool thing. Yeah, and I wonder in a broad
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.800]  perspective whether or not you know and clearly that's
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:29.000]  That this sort of AI based interface, you know conversational AI, you know
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.280]  It's it's you know
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:37.040]  It's the how from 2001 really is that the end goal where you have a computer that is a fully function or seems like a fully
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040]  function at sentient sentient
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.760]  person that you can communicate with and that you don't have to think about
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:50.000]  structuring your commands in a certain syntax or knowing that you can only you can ask about sports and weather and
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.520]  News, but you can't really just you know
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.600]  Talk to it in a conversational way that to where you can where you can just talk to it the way you would talk
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  to a person
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:07.000]  That clearly that's the way a lot of this stuff is going I mean it's it Apple's doing it Google's doing it Amazon's doing it
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:16.160]  Mm-hmm. I wonder at a basic level if it's better to just have a device like Alexa where that's the only interface as
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:21.040]  Opposed to the way that Android phones are gaining these, you know
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:21.800]  Okay
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.240]  Google commands in the way that hey Siri is being added to I'm sorry for any if I said that off for anybody
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.360]  Every time we talk about this
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:32.960]  I'm surprised it didn't make my phone go off. My phone is right here next to me and it did not
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.840]  Just make a policy to say it in a weird voice be like and so when you activate your highest here
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.920]  When you say that say those magic words
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.640]  whether there's a limit to for a device that's fundamentally about a
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:51.720]  Home screen full of apps and you go and launch an app and then go back to the home screen and go to another app
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.240]  Which is a great
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:59.640]  It's you know, obviously been great for the last 10 years for the iPhone whether or not there's a limit to how how good?
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.720]  The Siri functions can be for a conversational interface for the phone on a device that's fundamentally app based
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.440]  Mm-hmm
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:15.640]  You are you talking about the silos of data? Well, yes silos of data and just whether or not it's it's never gonna be as good
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.920]  as it could be
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920]  just because it's
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:25.880]  It's just never it just never works out to glom and oh I see so constraints because of the constraints
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:31.640]  It's gonna be better because it has to be right. That's what I think. Yeah, maybe yeah. Yeah, maybe I mean
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.680]  I think that the Alexa thing is just the tip of the iceberg and you know, of course
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:42.200]  Hey Syrian, okay, Google do play into that too, but a lot of these functions are going to be
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.160]  Massively improved by the introduction and application of AI
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.640]  All right, and I think AI is very you know, it's kicking into high gear right now
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:55.680]  It's there's tons and tons of heat in the startup world about AI
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.800]  I'd like to refer to AI and I'm you know, forgive me
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.040]  Somebody else has probably said this more eloquently in the past
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.520]  I just haven't come across it but I I'd like to view it as a technology that is
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.160]  Additive like you pour AI into things and it makes those things better, right?
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:19.080]  Whereas opposed to some other technologies are displacing technologies. They supplant or replace older things, right?
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.160]  You don't still keep a calculator around and put AI in it
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.520]  You just use your phone your phone has a calculator in it
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:30.840]  But not that replaced your calculator or placed your camera. I replaced your whatever but AI
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.400]  When you it's a technology and when you do put it or and a discipline
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.400]  I guess you could call it but when you put it into things
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:43.680]  It makes those things better and better able to understand and better able to contextualize your wishes and desires
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.880]  So it improves their functionality
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:53.240]  so something like hey Siri with a fully functioning AI component not just like bits and bobs of AI theory applied to a
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:59.240]  Chatbot or applied to you know, finding information but like a real AI system
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.120]  I mean, I think that's pretty exciting and something like Alexa
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.720]  Allows you to take full advantage of that because it does say like look
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.120]  This is the only way you can use me man
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:12.880]  Like you just talk to me because I can I can handle it, you know, I can get you there from here
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:18.040]  and that that future seems very very compelling and if Amazon wants to be
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.080]  In control of your home and in control of the goods that in services that come in and out of your home
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:28.040]  Then I think that that's a great place for them to be is right on your countertop, right?
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.600]  Yeah
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:32.000]  Yeah, I don't do you have one. Do you have one at the house?
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.480]  No, I don't I'm talking about it a whole lot, but I don't have one
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.900]  I don't live literally it was just like I've seen other ones in use and you know kind of dinked around and it's just
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.880]  Seems really cool. I just haven't gotten around ordering one because
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.000]  We use it we have those Amazon Dash buttons like the ones you're talking about
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.280]  I'm like, I'm good with those like I walk by my cabinet
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.280]  I'm like, oh I need kitty litter and I just punch it, you know
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:46:00.080]  Jonas loves the Amazon Dash buttons. And so he likes it. Yeah, but it's and he's he's a really he's 12
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.680]  So he's he's you know, he's not super young and he's a relatively disciplined kid
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:10.120]  We've never really had problems with him, you know doing anything out of control or you know, like
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.440]  you know like trusting him like
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.920]  With something like that, but it's so appealing to him
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.280]  He really wants to press the button and then he's he's like, can I press it again? It's like no
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:23.280]  no, you can not like
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.380]  Like we do not need more baby wipes, right?
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:32.680]  It's like we'll let you do it once but like opening the door just a bit to let him click the button once it's
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:36.680]  Good because he wants he just wants to go click click click click click
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.520]  It's a very strange thing to watch, right?
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:45.120]  and I kind of understand the appeal of it because I kind of would like to too I would just like to see like
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.720]  37 cases of paper towels show up at our
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.360]  Right
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:56.040]  Right exactly like well, I guess we don't need to buy paper towels for like it would be if it would be a fun thing
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.040]  to have delivered
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:04.200]  Yeah, like well you gotta have that and a 50 gallon tub of lube so you have to clean it up with
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.480]  So sorry, any I digressed on that but I just thought that I think that's an interesting bit of their business
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.760]  Oh, I definitely agree and I and I you know, the other thing that it has is
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:21.160]  Okay, so they try we talked about that. They tried to make a phone and they didn't make a phone
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.720]  well, maybe the phone business is
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.560]  over in terms of these little
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:34.320]  Four to five inch pieces of touchscreen glass that go in our pocket and the answer is it's the iPhone and Android and that's right
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.640]  That's who's you know, those are the two that that want out
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.580]  What's the next thing the next thing but you know in terms of hey
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:46.840]  What about like ubiquitous computer that you just speak to that there is no winner in that yet
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.020]  and so that it's you know, that's open territory where they still have a chance to win whereas the
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.520]  Touchscreen interface that you know is on the piece of glass that you carry in your pocket. It's too late
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.040]  Yep, I think you might be right I had
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:08.760]  It's hard at this point to foresee anybody really chipping a major chunk out of that particular business
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:14.180]  But there are plenty of other businesses and plenty of other ways for people to interact with you know
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:18.040]  I'd like I said a data a data farm somewhere and in Idaho
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:24.480]  So there's no guarantee that the pocket computer is the only interface that we're ever going to have that
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:30.480]  That really has a enormous effect on the market. So I think the people's best efforts are placed elsewhere
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.000]  I linked to a couple pieces in the last few days one from Tom Warren at the verge and then
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.200]  A Paul throughout piece just done. Hey, I think Windows Phone might it might be time to just call it it, you know
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:47.380]  Call it. I you know, it's funny. I I feel like the piece I linked to it at the verge
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:50.620]  Maybe I was too flippant. I didn't want to come across as as
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.600]  Gloating or you know happy about it
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.160]  If anything I'm a little sad like and I kind of feel the same way about Windows Phone that I felt about web OS
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:04.240]  The the palm touchscreen thing which was that this is clearly nicely enough designed
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  that if yeah
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.480]  If market share were distributed
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.440]  Fairly on the basis of design quality it did. I don't know where the
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:19.440]  What number Windows Phone would have wound up with but it would have been a big enough number that it was a healthy platform
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.760]  Like maybe it still would have been third place
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.660]  But it it wouldn't have been you know would have been like third place with a different decent chunk of the pie
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:32.380]  And that's just not how it's just not you know, and that
[01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:40.660]  Famously, that's a you know, it led Wall Street collectively to say design doesn't matter because you know back when Apple was doing
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:43.260]  Very poorly in the late 90s mid to late 90s
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:44.060]  everybody would say well
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:50.020]  You know Apple stuff is way better designed than PCs and Microsoft software and the market would say well
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.020]  There's proof that design doesn't matter. I
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:58.080]  Would say what was actually proved is that design is not enough that it needs to be part of a compelling story and that
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.160]  it certainly doesn't hurt and it can help and it's
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.560]  Allowed Apple to sort of build this sustainable success story
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.520]  But it's just not enough and that to me is somebody who cares so much about design
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.760]  It's just sort of sad to see Windows Phone
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:21.240]  Not really take off because it's certainly a lot of original thinking and I you know, the times I've spent with the Windows Phone
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.580]  I've enjoyed it more way more than I have when I've tried an Android phone
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:27.780]  Other than the fact that there aren't any apps for it
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:34.340]  Right, right. The first-party stuff is pretty much all you enjoy because the third-party stuff is if it's there
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:38.460]  It's usually not built extremely well or never got the chance to be
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.640]  I always like the hardware. I mean, like I said the original
[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:49.980]  Lumia, I reviewed that thing the the original rounded corner model. What was that 850? I can't I believe you're right
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:55.420]  I'm gonna get the number wrong or probably but I just loved I'm it's just so like feels like a lozenge and
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:59.420]  Material that they use there's just warm in your hands. It looks really good. It was a luxurious
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:05.860]  Polycarbonate and I know that you can say that. Oh, you're just looking for a fancy word for plastic
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:12.460]  But it it just felt like because of the word plastic II as an adjective has a negative connotation
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:16.000]  It just isn't fair to call it plastic because it really felt like a high-quality material
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.900]  Yeah, and at the time all the iPhones were hard-edged
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:25.820]  And and that it provided a nice contrast and of course now the iPhones are back to feeling more organic
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.020]  Which I appreciate but I think it definitely
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:34.140]  It stood out and it was well designed and it was a beautiful piece of kit and I thought that their OS did
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:38.780]  Complement the you know, slightly bullnose touchscreen and everything that they did about it
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:42.780]  I thought it would compliment itself very well, but it goes to show as you mentioned
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:46.800]  It's you know execution at scale is not just about design
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.380]  You can't just be like this is a beautiful piece of thing because it you know, that doesn't always work
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.660]  I mean look at the DeLorean, you know, right? I
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:52:00.980]  yeah, I think and I really do think it's existed a lot longer than web OS did this is Windows Phone simply by the
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:03.100]  races of
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:09.100]  Microsoft's willingness to absorb losses quarter after quarter after quarter to try to get this thing off the ground, but
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:16.500]  It's getting to the point like the year-over-year sales of the Windows Phone for the holiday quarter. The drop was terrible
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.500]  I mean it was like a 40% drop which is
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:23.120]  For a platform that was already really struggling in terms of market share
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:27.200]  Yeah, one point one percent of the market is not going to cut it
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:27.900]  Yeah
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:31.020]  and even if you want to and I don't even know what you compare it to I mean
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:36.100]  I guess the best thing you compare it to would be maybe the max market share at the at its nadir
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:41.660]  You know circa I don't know 1999 2000 or so
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:48.100]  You know, which was maybe worldwide something like two percent two or three percent of the PC market
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:54.220]  But it was a different it wasn't just like that Apple had any any two to three percent of the market
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:58.100]  It wasn't like a random two to three percent, which I think would have been completely unsustainable
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.740]  it was the fact that they had very specific two to three percent like
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.980]  Largely in North America so that it wasn't spread out across the world
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:10.660]  They had certain industries like the design industry where their market share
[01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:14.020]  Was you know way into the double digits?
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:16.900]  and so it could sustain things like
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.580]  Graphic design apps and you know
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:22.260]  Then there's certain types of you know
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:28.740]  third-party apps that that Apple and the Mac always had an advantage over Windows for because the all the people who cared about having
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.700]  really good quality
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.700]  indie apps were all by
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.940]  Self-definition they were they were Mac users
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:40.860]  Whereas window Windows phones one to two percent of the market doesn't really have any kind of cohesion like that
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:44.500]  It's not a compelling target for anything in terms of software development
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:51.500]  Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep, exactly. You can't build it and they will come it's gotta go together. Yeah
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.860]  Last but not least only thing I ever talked about was this to talk about bourbon
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:00.300]  You do this thing excuse for this whole thing, right?
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:00.740]  Yeah
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:07.060]  You you're starting to annoy me though because you you'll do this thing where you'll get you'll like make a run and find some kind
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:09.580]  of amazing find to add to your liquor
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.020]  your your liquor cabinet at home and
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.060]  it's gotten to the point where like you
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.340]  You've got so much good stuff there that I'm sort of annoyed
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:26.740]  Well, I mean you're welcome to come over and drink it I mean you got to come to Fresno but
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:33.240]  People often but I bring it up because I get it on people to understand people know that I like to drink and people know
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:34.820]  you know
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:35.940]  the
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:41.900]  Sweet, you know the brown liquors that your Bourbons your rise or are the ones that are sort of up my alley and the ones
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:47.400]  I'm more interested in and I get so I get people asking for my advice and I often don't know how to answer like I
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:51.660]  Feel like I know more than most people and I have very strong opinions on it. But
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:56.060]  Mm-hmm, but to me it's a very hard to answer the hard question to answer
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.940]  Yeah, I did it is I get this thing when people come over
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.980]  You know people come over to the house and be like, you know, I'm like, hey, yeah
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:07.220]  Would you like a drink or something? You know, you know what soda or water or do you want to drink?
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:08.820]  And because I don't you know
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:14.720]  I like to force people to drink if they don't want to but when they come over and go oh no
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:21.260]  Yeah, sure. Well, I'll have anything. I don't care. Um, that's like the hardest for me when they don't I'm like well crap
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:25.620]  What do I give them? You know cuz you know, they're as we've spoken about this before
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:30.800]  But there's some like I'm a big bourbon fan. Like I like bourbon. I like whiskey too, but I like bourbon a lot
[01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:36.300]  And so there's some kinds of bourbon and whiskey that are extremely challenging to the palate
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:42.140]  Like they're very aggressive or they they're very high alcohol content and they can be appreciated for what they are
[01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:46.940]  But you can't just drop that on someone's like hitting them in the face with a hammer when they ask you for like a you
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:51.940]  Know a kiss it's like goodness. They're not gonna have a good time and they're not you know, they're gonna be like what'd you do?
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:53.940]  This to me. This is not very nice
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:57.340]  So you have to start them off with something that's simpler
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:03.940]  You know that less less complex and has just a couple of really simple notes that they can they can palette
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:07.740]  But then the instinct is to want to give them the good stuff because you're like, you're my guest, you know
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:09.500]  I want you to taste it's amazing
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:14.620]  You know thing but usually the quote unquote good stuff is firstly when it comes to
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:20.060]  Like bourbon and that kind of huge is it's like really aggressive, you know, really challenging
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:24.340]  And so you just got to kind of go like I'll start it off with this, you know
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:29.660]  And so I typically start them off with like, you know, Elijah Craig, which is a really solid
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:34.300]  I know you like that stuff too. Yeah, it's really solid bourbon and it tastes good
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:39.540]  It's easy to drink and you know, it feels good in the belly and it's nice little kind of warming up
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.020]  For the throat and everything
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:47.100]  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about. I have I don't even I looked before we started recording and I have two
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:49.620]  like special bottles of
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.980]  They're both actually rise or neither of them are bourbon's but I have two special like really hard to find
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:03.700]  Bottles in my collection right now. And actually I've never opened either of them. I have a Thomas H. Handy Sazerac straight rye whiskey
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.380]  Now that's 64 and this is I love it
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:13.700]  It's you can tell it's literally like really really small batch because it's just written on the label with a sharpie. It says 64
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:16.780]  64.2% alcohol by volume
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:23.220]  Which is what it was that improve that's how so it's like 128 proof, right?
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:26.300]  most bourbon's and rise are somewhere between
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:34.060]  45% right somewhere a little north or south of 45% alcohol by volume, right which is 90 proof
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:36.460]  and
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:40.940]  That's what most people would consider to be very very a very drinkable alcohol by volume
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.460]  Mm-hmm, and then I have
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.220]  From will it I have this will it?
[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:49.500]  XCF have you ever heard of this? It's
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:53.540]  Exploratory. Yeah. Yes. That's the ones that do like experimental one, right?
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:58.240]  Yeah, exploratory cask flavor and it's they even put like a version number on at 1.0
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:03.860]  I I a friend of I don't even know how the hell I ended up with this my friend of mine
[01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:08.540]  I was able to get it was I do want some and I was like, of course get me a bottle
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:14.140]  And I I don't even remember what I paid for it, but it was like enough that I blacked it out of my
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:20.740]  That's the key really when you're buying good booze, it's just you know, don't look at the damage you paid
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:26.460]  But I haven't opened either of them, but I'm saving them and back of my mind for like one, you know
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:29.540]  Good friends come over. That's that's the sort of that's the sort of
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:34.620]  Booze that you save for a special occasion, but then you run into exactly the problem that you're talking about
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:40.380]  Which is that most people you can't just pour them like a hundred and thirty no proof
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:44.780]  Thing and that they're going to enjoy it or appreciate it at all
[01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:47.620]  Right, they're gonna have a bad time for sure
[01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.340]  I mean, I think like one of the ones that I like to give people when they're like, yeah
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:56.660]  Let me try something more interesting that I may not have tried and you know
[01:58:56.660 --> 01:59:00.700]  That's maybe they have had bourbon there their whiskey drink or like they've had, you know
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:07.460]  The standard stuff or whatever and they're interested in something a little bit more out. There is normally I'll pour them some
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:10.000]  some Noah's Mill
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.660]  Which is a really respectable and kind of out of the way
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:16.780]  Bourbon that most people won't have had
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:24.620]  It's getting a little bit more popular these days. I think in the last couple of years they have they're you're able to find it
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.140]  more places
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:28.900]  It's a I think it's a blend
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:34.900]  I can't remember but it's like a bunch of different years ages between like four years and 20 years or something like that
[01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:38.580]  But it's pretty pretty decent and I think that's like a hundred and
[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:41.380]  114 proof or something like that
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:45.020]  I can't remember exactly but it's up there and it but it has like this
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:48.700]  This little bit of maple and I taste a little bit of vanilla in it
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:53.300]  So it's like very it has a little bit of sweetness to counteract that that real spicy
[01:59:53.300 --> 02:00:01.260]  Back of your throat, you know thing but that it's like an introduction to them like opens their mind because there is flavor there
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:07.340]  But there's also that spice that real like raspy spice that gets them wakes them up, you know
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.980]  opens up their nasal passages and you know
[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:15.780]  Constricts the throat for just a second as it goes down and you breathe out and all everything opens up, you know
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:17.340]  and you got to kind of
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:21.780]  prime the pump with something like that before you can move them into something like a Yamazaki or
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:23.460]  it or or
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:28.020]  You know something really high alcohol that also has a great amount of taste to it
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:32.060]  Like like a will it's pot still or something like that the will it so the I looked it up
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:34.100]  The XCF is only a hundred and three proof
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:39.740]  So it's actually I think it probably would be the one that would be better if I were to have somebody over and you know
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:47.360]  Let's open a bottle of some special stuff that people could could drink that and according to this the MSRP was 140 a bottle
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.360]  So that's probably about what I paid for
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.200]  Mmm, which is yeah, that's way more than I usually pay
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:58.480]  my my advice to the people who are sort of just wanting to get into it is I go back to
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.880]  I think I've mentioned this on the show you before but that there's a golf book
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:05.520]  I don't haven't played golf regularly in years
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.040]  But a guy named Harvey
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:11.640]  Peenik PEN Ick his little red book and he was like this old really old like he
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.680]  Coached golf until he was like 100 years old in Texas
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:20.480]  And he had this little notebook of advice and they turned it into a book and it's just it's just gold
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:22.520]  it is just such a great book and it's
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.960]  but one of his things was one of his piece of advice if you're learning to play golf is
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:34.200]  Master one club and it ought to be it ought to be like a 7-iron because it's an iron exactly right in the middle
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:39.680]  and that if you were going to let's just say on a dare if you were going to play an entire round of golf with just
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:46.200]  One club in a putter a 7-iron would be a pretty reasonable choice and that just go out there and just master that one club
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:48.200]  and when you go to the driving range just
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:51.480]  At least half the time don't even take the other clubs out of your trunk
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:57.120]  Just take your 7-iron and hit the whole bucket of balls with the 7-iron and get to know that one club in the middle
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:58.760]  of the range
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:05.080]  Better than all your other clubs combined and that fundamentally it's a great advice because you shouldn't have a different swing for a driver
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.800]  Than you do with a wedge. You should have like one swing that you adjust to the different lengths of clubs
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.600]  All right, and then you go from there and then if you're even having a bad day, you know
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.600]  You can at least hit a 7-iron
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.640]  And then you judge all these other clubs from there
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.220]  that's my advice for a lot of things in life and it's same thing for like if you wanted to get into
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.360]  whiskey and bourbon is find one that you really like and
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:32.920]  then just buy that one a couple times in a row and really get to know it and then
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:37.880]  Base your opinions on other things as you start to experiment from there, right?
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:42.960]  Yeah, if you find something that you really enjoy you're like, oh man, I like drinking this
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.400]  that's probably a good indicator of what your palate is, you know, and
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:52.400]  It's bourbon is one of those things that you know whiskey or even alcohol in general
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:58.800]  But bourbon and whiskey especially one of those things that are very much like wine in that somebody can tell you all day
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:03.280]  That something is the best thing that you've ever tasted or that you're going to taste or whatever
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:08.960]  But the moment you find something you like that's your palate. That's just you
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:12.020]  That's what you like and you can of course increase your
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:18.840]  appreciation of things over time by reading about them and understanding the flavors of it or understanding the history of it and even if you
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:22.160]  Don't necessarily want to drink it every day. You can appreciate something
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.740]  But if you are able to find something that you generally enjoy that tickles your pleasure centers
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:33.000]  That's your taste and that's okay. Like don't let anybody tell you that, you know
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:40.660]  You're what you're drinking is not, you know, enjoyable to you because if it's enjoyable it's enjoyable and that's why I love this whole
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.460]  resurgence in recent years of these craft
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:49.660]  Bourbon makers, right? There's lots of Bourbons under four years old now that are that are pretty drinkable
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:56.700]  And there's plenty under 10 or 15 that are amazing for not a whole lot of money
[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:01.300]  You know the very very affordable Bourbons like Old Weller for instance
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:05.420]  which is getting a little harder to find because it's made from the same mash as Pappy's but
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:11.500]  Old Weller either their their 12-year or their select or their antique
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:17.340]  The antique is a little spicier, but the Old Weller 12-year I think is really really delicious
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:21.700]  And it's just unassuming small unassuming bottle with a plastic cap and it runs
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:30.140]  thirty five dollars, I think something like that and it's just so so smooth and tasty and drinkable and like
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.300]  You know, it's enjoyable to drink
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:37.500]  it doesn't it has a little it'll open you up a little bit like any whiskey would but it doesn't just like
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:39.500]  you know hit you in the face and it just
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:44.460]  Really really enjoyable and yes, it's not like a top-shelf
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:46.980]  you know whiskey but
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:53.260]  That's not the point. You know, the point is does it make you feel amazing? Does it make you feel?
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:58.780]  Those the sensations of like warmth and sentimentality and all the stuff that you know
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:05:01.860]  A nice little glass will will bring you and I think that that's important
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:07.380]  yeah, am I the go-to the one that really was is like the seven iron of my
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.340]  palette is
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:11.900]  Just bullet bourbon. Mm-hmm
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:16.980]  And it makes a lot of sense. I didn't even know that like when I first I was like this this one
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:18.580]  And it you could drink it any way
[02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:22.020]  I would want to drink it if I want to drink it in an old-fashioned want to drink it
[02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:25.500]  Just you know neat want to just drink it in a glass with ice
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:31.460]  I like it every I like it every way but I like I know it and in hindsight what I've known
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:37.920]  But what I found out about bullet since then is that bullet is considered by many people to be a very rye heavy bourbon
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:44.960]  Mm-hmm, and if I'm not right, right a regular their orange label bourbon is is rye heavy
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.880]  And then now they make they have a green label rye
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:56.900]  But it explains why I like rye so much in general is that my favorite bourbon is a sort of rye heavy one
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:02.320]  But that's my advice to people is more than any specific list of
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:08.680]  Of bourbons that I could that we could give you to start with is just try some of the bigger label ones and find one
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:13.080]  That you're like there. I like that one better than the other ones that I've had and then just drink that one for a while
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:19.040]  Yeah, yeah exactly because if you don't have a baseline you'll never know, you know, if you're all over the map
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.840]  You'd be like, oh this tastes good. I guess this tastes good
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:22.920]  I don't know idea, you know
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.840]  But if you find something that you like and you're you lay those tracks then you can take detours
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:32.660]  You know left or right and and find out the things you like. Yeah, one of my favorites to another one
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:35.000]  My favorites is have we talked about this Eagle rare
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:43.520]  Yeah, I think so Merlin man turned me on to this a while ago and it's really I mean it's another one where it's super affordable
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.660]  I think in Pennsylvania, it's usually like $24
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:52.200]  Mm-hmm, and it comes in like that that big tall wine shaped glass
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:59.120]  That's just like the most generic shape booze glass, you know, or a bottle of the booze could ever be shipping
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:02.760]  It's just like a cylindrical round tall glass
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:09.700]  Like there's nothing special or you know, it's so generically shaped like the silhouette of the the glass
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:13.880]  24 bucks super reasonable price and it's
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:19.400]  You know if you were stranded on a desert island and all you had was a case of Eagle rare
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:25.560]  You'd be like, oh that's I got lucky. Yeah, I do have a bottle of it and I do like it a lot
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:33.240]  It's a little it's a little hotter than an Elijah Craig like 12-year which I like the alleged Elijah Craig 12-years my well whiskey
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.000]  That's kind of what I pour in my decanter and keep there to make an old-fashioned during the week
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:37.400]  You know
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:43.680]  It's not not a special occasion or whatever and it's just a little bit spicier than that and but it's still extremely tasty
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:45.680]  I agree with you on that
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.040]  I think that they're
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:53.580]  Good. Well people keep asking me if I've had the Elijah Craig 18 and I can't find it. Oh, right. Have you?
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.480]  Yes, I have a bottle. It's delicious. See you make me angry
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:07.040]  Look this the advantage of living where I live is that I've got this local liquor guy who runs a liquor store and he just
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:12.240]  Finds me everything that I asked for like I'll be like, hey, I'm really, you know thinking about this
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:15.440]  I tried this once and I really like it and if you could find me a bottle
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:21.200]  I really appreciate it and he just I like I don't know what back of what truck these things fall off of but he just
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:25.240]  He just show up on his shelf and it's just a little liquor store in you know
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:31.400]  I mean Fresno is not exactly a TV town, but it's like 500,000 people but most folks here. I'm gonna be honest
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.560]  They don't drink super high-end bourbon, you know, I mean there's probably you know
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:40.180]  A few hundred of us in town that maybe like this stuff or even care or know what it is
[02:08:40.180 --> 02:08:45.860]  So if you can convince somebody to stock it, then you're pretty much got free rein, you know
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:51.180]  Whereas in a bigger city like San Francisco or somebody someplace like that. Yeah, I mean, good luck, right?
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:56.340]  It's all raffled and you know all that stuff. So that's how I find some stuff. But yeah, so the 18 is
[02:08:56.860 --> 02:08:59.800]  It's good. It's really solid because it's just like
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:05.700]  It's just like a like a stuffy couch version of the Elijah Craig comfy chair
[02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:10.220]  You know like where you just fall into a little bit more. It's a little bit more aromatic
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.500]  Like it's more there's more scent to it
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:17.500]  It opens up a little bit and it also is a little teeny bit mellower and smoother
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:22.820]  Which is almost impossible, you know from the from the 12-year which is really good and that 12-year too
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:25.300]  Very affordable very affordable bourbon. That's
[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:32.240]  Anywhere you find it anywhere you find it out that mower, you know, whatever your local chain place is and that's probably about 25 bucks, right?
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:38.880]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly it like a Christmastime. You can find them on special for 20 bucks. Sometimes it's it's great
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  It's a really really good buy
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.280]  I like that a lot. Yeah very much compared comparable to
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:51.560]  Beer where you don't have to pay much at all for really really good stuff
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:55.360]  That's another thing that I really I personally enjoy greatly about
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:03.160]  I drink bourbon and rise that you'd really don't have to spend much at all to get seriously seriously good stuff
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:08.320]  so that would be my last bit of advice is really don't don't get fooled by the fact that for things like
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:13.360]  well, just to compare it to another whiskey that compared to like scotch like good scotch is
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:19.000]  Necessarily expensive and I don't know how much of that is just the shipping from
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:22.320]  Scotland and how much of it is
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:26.480]  Taxes and how much of it is just the way that the industry is set up to keep the prices high
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:34.240]  I don't know, but you you can get easily get three top-notch bottles of bourbon for the same price as one top-notch bottle of scotch
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.720]  Yeah easily easily and obviously you have to sort of like the you know
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:42.400]  the taste of rye and the kind of mash that whiskey is made out of but
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:50.680]  Bourbon's made out of but I just if you are interested in that kind of thing you can it's so affordable compared to
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:57.440]  Anything in the middle to high end or rare whiskeys. They're just they get so crazy so quick
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000]  Because they're just very limited capacity
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:06.000]  Most of the places don't make any more than X number of cases and haven't for decades, you know
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.400]  So there's just it's just a limitations thing. It's like they only make so many cases. That's all they're ever gonna make
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:17.680]  Good luck, you know and that like a lot of these bourbon distilleries, especially any of the Buffalo Trace
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:21.400]  Um bourbon so that they can distribute it through Buffalo Trace. They're
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:25.360]  Fairly high capacity but still pretty good quality
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.760]  Bourbons, so you do not have to spend a ton of money
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:33.880]  So I mean if and there's one too, like if you they've been marketing really really heavily lately
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.480]  But I actually I tried it recently just on a whim and I have to admit it was not bad at all
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:45.700]  Was is the larceny and if you've had larceny, I've seen I actually I can see the label in my head
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:47.700]  But I have not that's a Buffalo Trace
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:54.860]  I don't know who distributes it. That's a good question. Maybe I can find out but the larceny is it's like
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:12:00.600]  22 bucks at most places at the most and it is it's a Kentucky style bourbon
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.400]  It's not bad at all
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:08.000]  John Fitzgerald is is the distributor, but it's um
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:10.120]  It's pretty good
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.120]  I I mean
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:16.560]  You know like in I have to preface all of this talk that we've been having about bourbon like I don't know anything
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:19.840]  You know, this is just all I know is what I taste, you know
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:23.680]  and and a little bit that I try to absorb and talk to people about but I
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:28.120]  You know, it may be a mass-market thing, but it's pretty solid
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.400]  It's like one of those things like a two-buck Chuck where you're like, hey, this isn't that bad
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:39.600]  But it's like 92 proof. It's it's a wheat bourbon. We bourbons are generally smooth or wheated
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.220]  Excuse me, bourbons are generally smoother and kind of more forgiving and easier to drink
[02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:48.760]  Because it's like wheat instead of rye after corn
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:55.040]  right is like the majority is corn and then wheat instead of corn and then rye and that that
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.600]  Old weller that's also a weeded bourbon, but it's and most famous
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.600]  Most famously pappy van Winkle is a we did bourbon
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:12.500]  Correct. Yeah. Yeah pappies. Well a lot of the the legend around pappies is that it was one of the first like really
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:17.220]  Highly rated we did bourbons. All right, so you're saying larceny is we did
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.680]  Yes, it is a we did bourbon. It's like 18 to 20 bucks, I think
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:28.320]  and it's called johnny Fitzgerald larceny and it's you know a
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:33.240]  Very affordable. It's everywhere. It's a mass-market bourbon for sure
[02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:37.320]  so, you know if that turns you off that turns you off but as far as the taste I was
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:43.720]  You know, I thought it was pretty solid. Yeah. Well, it's good to know. Yeah, you make me angry
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.880]  Anything else before we cut it off
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.040]  No, I think I'm good. Yeah, I think it's time for an old-fashioned actually now to think about it. Yeah, it is
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:56.160]  Matthew Panzerino
