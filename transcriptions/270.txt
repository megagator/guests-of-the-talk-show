[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  Matt I I have wanted to have you on the show for a very long time. I'm really glad to be on this. Yeah
[00:10.520 --> 00:13.240]  There's a lot of politics on my agenda for this week
[00:13.920 --> 00:15.920]  so I thought I
[00:15.920 --> 00:21.360]  Thought who else who else but this would be the week to invite you on for the first time
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.600]  for people who don't know you because this is your first time on the show and you're
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.940]  your your your writing career is outside the the
[00:29.160 --> 00:35.440]  Apple sphere that that I tend to inhabit that listeners of this show might be most familiar with tell people a little about yourself
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.360]  I'm a political writer in Washington DC. I've been covering politics and economic policy here for
[00:43.040 --> 00:44.840]  Probably 16 years now
[00:44.840 --> 00:50.520]  But I'm also an Apple enthusiast a big fan of during fireball big fan of the talk show
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.920]  I have been feeling left out of the whole sort of Mac discourse because my my keyboard had been working fine
[00:57.080 --> 00:59.080]  But just yesterday suddenly
[00:59.480 --> 01:06.800]  It went wonky on me. So so now I could complain with everyone else about this butterfly keyboards and which keyboard which model
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.680]  So it's a MacBook Pro from 2017. Okay
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.360]  7 or 13 or
[01:13.360 --> 01:21.120]  15 15 15 inch so touch bar so literally the device that you could solve this problem by going out and buying a new
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.600]  $2,400 it's really it's enough to get you into the conspiracy theory
[01:25.600 --> 01:29.600]  so he was it was putting me in a bad mood and then Tim Cook goes and
[01:30.520 --> 01:34.360]  Does this weird photo up with Trump and it's now I'm done. Oh
[01:35.320 --> 01:36.920]  man, I
[01:36.920 --> 01:40.800]  Have a new before we get into the the other stuff
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.840]  I have a new Apple product that I can report it is in my hand right now
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.120]  I don't know if you saw this but Apple this week shipped a new product
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.800]  It is the iPhones smart battery case for the iPhone 11 generation
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.000]  Is it good?
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.040]  It is and here's the interesting thing. They added a feature
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.120]  So they've had these smart battery cases before you know
[02:02.120 --> 02:05.640]  And they've got the right sort of weird hump on the back and you fold them over and now
[02:05.880 --> 02:09.200]  You know clearly they need a new one for this new camera with a different cutout
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.480]  This one comes with a dedicated camera button
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.840]  Okay
[02:14.840 --> 02:18.520]  It is recessed as opposed to sticking out
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.200]  So, you know like on these silicone cases that Apple makes like they make
[02:23.080 --> 02:26.880]  Fake buttons for the volume rockers and the power button that stick out
[02:27.400 --> 02:32.560]  This is a button that is sort of it's where you would expect a camera button to be
[02:32.560 --> 02:39.640]  So it's on the same side as the power button, but down and it's recessed rather than sticking out
[02:40.360 --> 02:43.080]  And from at any point whether the phone is locked
[02:43.480 --> 02:48.680]  Unlocked whether you're using an app if you click the button it immediately jumps you to the camera app
[02:49.800 --> 02:53.280]  And and then when you're in the camera app, it works as a shutter
[02:54.480 --> 02:57.520]  That's a pretty good feature. It is an amazing feature
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.840]  It is an amazing feature. I am generally someone who doesn't use a case and when I do use a case I
[03:04.520 --> 03:07.240]  Want one that's very thin and light
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.760]  And I don't struggle to get through a day on a battery life with the iPhone 11 Pro
[03:14.760 --> 03:18.560]  So I don't really need a battery case, but I am infatuated with this button
[03:19.560 --> 03:22.680]  Adding buttons it shows there. There is a new philosophy
[03:22.680 --> 03:27.320]  Yeah, like it's a long time right since they've been like what we need is more buttons. I
[03:28.920 --> 03:31.800]  Want this button on the phone
[03:31.800 --> 03:35.960]  I want them to add this to the phone and not just put it on the smart battery case a
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.600]  hardware button on a phone I
[03:38.920 --> 03:40.920]  You know, I
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.920]  Realize they're never going to do that
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.320]  Yeah, yeah, it's really kind of a fun little thing and they have
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.000]  It's sort of like a little delay
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.040]  I mean, I don't know somebody could probably measure it with like a super high-speed camera
[03:56.040 --> 04:00.440]  But it's it's some fraction of a second like maybe I'm gonna guess
[04:01.400 --> 04:02.440]  to
[04:02.440 --> 04:04.440]  200 milliseconds so maybe like
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.800]  One-fifth of a second you have to press and hold the button before the camera app actually opens up
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.680]  Because it's clearly clearly to prevent app accidental
[04:16.680 --> 04:20.280]  Like if it's jostling around in your purse or bag or something like that. Yeah
[04:21.080 --> 04:27.080]  That it won't just suddenly turn the camera on and then burn your battery down or you know while the while it's it's not being used
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.720]  And it's just long enough that you can't quite just quick click and uh,
[04:32.680 --> 04:34.680]  This is my almost my entire review
[04:34.680 --> 04:37.720]  You can't just click it and let go and have the camera app open
[04:38.040 --> 04:41.320]  You have to click it and hold keep the finger on it for a fraction of a second
[04:41.320 --> 04:43.320]  But if you think of it as a button that works
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.920]  Not by clicking and letting go but by pressing to turn it on it is it feels very fast
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.040]  It launches the camera app almost instantly, but you can't just click it
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.760]  There you go
[04:54.760 --> 04:56.760]  Buttons, that's my entire
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.520]  And then they also saved american manufacturing thanks. Yeah
[05:06.680 --> 05:09.160]  It's amazing it is absolutely amazing
[05:09.160 --> 05:15.800]  It's amazing. It is. Absolutely amazing. Should we do we do we have to explain what actually happened here?
[05:16.040 --> 05:21.560]  Is that just thinking jokes? Well, I assume that people know but we should explain it. Uh
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.960]  I believe that the timeline on this i'm sure it was in the works for weeks behind the scenes
[05:27.960 --> 05:31.100]  But officially I first became aware this monday
[05:31.720 --> 05:35.960]  that the white house issued a statement it came from the white house and they said that the
[05:35.960 --> 05:42.060]  You know, president trump is going to tour apple's mac pro assembly plant in austin texas on wednesday
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.240]  Uh, and that was pretty much it
[05:45.480 --> 05:51.320]  There was no official word as to you know, who from who if anyone from apple would be there presumably, you know
[05:51.320 --> 05:55.960]  I didn't take a genius to think tim cook would probably have to be there. You know, you can't really do it
[05:56.440 --> 05:58.440]  It's the president
[05:58.520 --> 06:00.520]  um
[06:01.480 --> 06:03.480]  But that was very quick so I
[06:03.480 --> 06:05.720]  I am an ambitious
[06:06.520 --> 06:11.320]  reporter that I am instantly got in contact with apple to see if I could obtain a
[06:11.960 --> 06:14.440]  Media pass for this event, whatever it was
[06:15.720 --> 06:21.880]  And I would have if I had it I was ready to try to you know book a flight to austin tuesday and and be there
[06:22.120 --> 06:29.800]  Um did not did not happen. I was not there. Uh, and basically what apple told me was that all of the media
[06:29.800 --> 06:35.720]  Passes are going through the white house and that if they wanted to they could maybe give me a phone number or something. But
[06:36.280 --> 06:40.600]  That seemed like like explaining who I am and why why I should go
[06:41.800 --> 06:43.560]  Yeah
[06:43.560 --> 06:47.480]  Too much. Yeah, and you know, i've got other stuff going on in thanksgiving
[06:47.480 --> 06:48.920]  Since we I wasn't really looking forward to it
[06:48.920 --> 06:53.800]  But it just seems so momentous that I really wanted to be there and maybe see you know, see what I could yeah
[06:54.440 --> 06:58.280]  What I could do, but I didn't uh, but anyway it did happen
[06:58.280 --> 07:00.280]  It did happen
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.760]  Do you want to take it from here
[07:02.760 --> 07:04.760]  so it happened and then they uh
[07:05.480 --> 07:08.120]  They went on the tour. They shot a video
[07:08.760 --> 07:16.680]  Uh trump did a tweet. He said today I opened a major apple manufacturing plant in texas that will bring high-paying jobs back to america
[07:17.080 --> 07:24.520]  Today nancy pelosi closed congress because she doesn't care about american workers, right? That was the yeah the the crux of it
[07:24.520 --> 07:29.160]  Um, so nancy pelosi is obviously not closed congress. I I'm general
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.720]  That's not a thing that happens
[07:31.720 --> 07:35.960]  Yeah, and I was also under the impression that congress has actually been pretty busy this week
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.120]  Right, so they went on a a recess right at the at the end of the day on thursday
[07:42.360 --> 07:48.140]  They went on recess for the thanksgiving week. So the members can go back home see their family see their constituents
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.760]  Very normal. They were all weak. They were doing these impeachment hearings
[07:52.760 --> 07:56.200]  Uh talking about crimes, um, but most importantly
[07:57.160 --> 08:01.160]  They weren't opening a new factory. No like at all. That's just made up
[08:01.800 --> 08:03.560]  This factory has been there
[08:03.560 --> 08:05.560]  Since 2013, right?
[08:05.720 --> 08:07.160]  right
[08:07.160 --> 08:13.580]  The old mac pros. Yeah, the trash can not even an apple factory. Nope. It's a company called flex f-l-e-x
[08:13.580 --> 08:22.220]  Ex, um, one of my friends quipped in a private slack group that they must be pretty flexible because they probably haven't been making
[08:22.300 --> 08:24.620]  Many mac mac pros the last few years
[08:25.180 --> 08:29.180]  Yeah, I got to imagine that was not doing a ton of business
[08:31.020 --> 08:32.380]  And
[08:32.380 --> 08:33.820]  you know
[08:33.820 --> 08:40.700]  And and cook tim cookie was right there and uh, you know could have said something he could have maybe tweeted later
[08:40.700 --> 08:46.220]  like a little clarification, uh, but nothing, um, and it seems like you know,
[08:47.100 --> 08:49.100]  uh, he's he's happy to
[08:49.420 --> 08:51.420]  Be a part of of the trump show
[08:52.140 --> 08:54.140]  in a way that you know, I think
[08:54.780 --> 08:59.980]  I mean, it's going to rub some people the wrong way just because they don't like donald trump, but also, you know me you
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.180]  Journalists just like factually speaking. It's not what happened there. He didn't open a new apple manufacturer plant and also
[09:07.820 --> 09:08.940]  trump's
[09:08.940 --> 09:10.940]  trade policies almost
[09:11.580 --> 09:14.380]  Made it impossible to assemble the computers there
[09:15.820 --> 09:17.420]  Yes, and
[09:17.420 --> 09:19.820]  So it is a new assembly line
[09:20.380 --> 09:27.260]  Right, like it's not like you can suddenly go from making the trash can 2013 mac pro to these all together new
[09:27.740 --> 09:32.860]  Even if it was a subtle tweak it would need a new line, but it's a radical tweak
[09:32.860 --> 09:35.580]  So there is a new assembly line in the plant
[09:35.580 --> 09:42.620]  Uh, they apple is does have a campus in austin where they do other things, but not not manufacturing assembly
[09:42.780 --> 09:46.620]  It's right. It's like like tech support like white collar jobs. Um,
[09:47.020 --> 09:53.340]  Well, I mean and they're opening a second one. Yeah, that's like the real thing that's happening. They had one and now there's two
[09:55.180 --> 10:00.300]  Right, they're spending like a billion dollars to expand either expand the existing campus or open a new one
[10:00.300 --> 10:03.420]  It's hard, you know, whatever you it they're close enough to each other that
[10:03.420 --> 10:08.540]  You know, I don't know what you count as the same campus or not, but they are building a billion dollars worth of
[10:09.660 --> 10:17.820]  You know campus there and they will be hiring people to work there. Um, but it is not manufacturing jobs or not new ones and again
[10:19.580 --> 10:23.020]  All of that matters or at least it should matter to those of us right
[10:25.020 --> 10:31.580]  Who both try to report things truthfully and who value the truth in what they read about the world
[10:31.580 --> 10:38.780]  But uh, seeing this you could have seen this coming. I saw this coming a mile away that trump was going to claim that this was
[10:39.420 --> 10:44.700]  I'm, almost surprised. He didn't claim that they were on the cusp of assembling the mac pro in china until he swept in and
[10:45.420 --> 10:49.260]  And did this I it's an apple, you know has been playing this
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.060]  probably since 2016, I mean
[10:53.340 --> 10:56.940]  Well, I I don't know I forget the timeline on the mac pro but
[10:56.940 --> 11:03.900]  I guess it was 2017 when they had the the the special. Hey, we're going to do a new mac pro and here's the future pro mac hardware
[11:05.020 --> 11:08.940]  But it's they you know an apple is apple it's even trump aside
[11:09.420 --> 11:15.260]  They don't talk about things until they're ready to say it. So but it's and they don't like to explain their back thinking and so
[11:16.220 --> 11:23.180]  Whatever their plan b was for where to assemble these I think it's obvious plan a all along was that they would continue what they started
[11:23.180 --> 11:29.500]  In 2013 and assembled these very low quantity high-end mac pro computers
[11:30.620 --> 11:33.740]  In austin where they had started them in 20 that was their plan all along
[11:34.620 --> 11:41.260]  Right. Well, and it always seemed like the mac pro in texas thing was in part a political gesture
[11:41.500 --> 11:45.180]  Yes, they wanted to say they had a product that was made in the usa
[11:45.820 --> 11:50.380]  They don't sell that many mac pros. Uh, they are selling to a pricey and sensitive clientele
[11:50.380 --> 11:54.860]  I mean these things cost a ton of money, right? Yeah, uh, so they still won't tell you really
[11:55.180 --> 12:01.180]  They have like a starting price of five thousand dollars in a configuration. Almost nobody who needs a mac pro is going to be happy with
[12:02.060 --> 12:06.540]  Right. So if you have to further pad the margins, whatever it's it's not a big deal, right?
[12:06.540 --> 12:14.380]  And it lets them make the statement right and all their products the laptops the iphones the ipads that that move real volume
[12:14.620 --> 12:17.820]  And where it really makes a difference to them economically
[12:17.820 --> 12:24.380]  That's you know, there are parts of it are actually made in america, but yeah primary assembly is in asia
[12:25.020 --> 12:26.060]  and
[12:26.060 --> 12:28.060]  You know, so it's not
[12:28.060 --> 12:33.580]  It never seemed like they would have wanted to move it out of there and it's not totally unusual to sort of be
[12:33.900 --> 12:39.980]  Trying to make nice, uh with politicians to some extent, uh by having it here, but it's very
[12:41.180 --> 12:43.180]  It's very tied in to
[12:43.180 --> 12:48.620]  Actually needing to work with trump or curry favor with trump on some other policy questions
[12:48.780 --> 12:52.460]  Uh, because like even to get this plan off the the line
[12:53.100 --> 12:55.100]  they had to ask for
[12:55.500 --> 12:59.900]  waivers so that they could import the components because I I guess a lot of the
[13:00.700 --> 13:05.740]  The silicon and other stuff that's uh in the mac pro still comes from asia
[13:05.740 --> 13:10.220]  So, you know, they would have to pay tariffs on it. That'd make it even more expensive
[13:10.220 --> 13:16.300]  But trump gave them a bunch of waivers. So that's why they're doing it there. Um, and it's I mean
[13:16.300 --> 13:22.220]  It's it's backwards to say it's like a trump policy success, right? It's I think as I wrote
[13:23.740 --> 13:26.460]  I know I already I already can't quote myself
[13:27.180 --> 13:27.980]  but
[13:27.980 --> 13:34.140]  But the basic idea is that it it it opened not because of trump's trade policies, but despite
[13:34.140 --> 13:42.060]  Trump's trade policies and specifically needed exemptions from them. I mean they call them waivers but waivers are just another word for exemption, right?
[13:42.060 --> 13:46.140]  They're exempt from tariffs that they otherwise would have had to pay and of course
[13:46.780 --> 13:51.580]  All of these things, you know are made all around the world but stuff like ssd's and ram
[13:51.820 --> 13:56.300]  I think only comes from asia. I don't I don't think there's anywhere to source, you know
[13:56.300 --> 14:04.300]  Ddr4 ram from american-made manufacturer, of course, it's from all over the world. Um, right
[14:03.020 --> 14:08.860]  And so it would have been a lot more seamless in the hypothetical world where anybody else anybody
[14:08.860 --> 14:14.060]  Any other major character candidate had won the 2016 election not just hillary clinton
[14:14.780 --> 14:16.780]  or bernie sanders or
[14:18.060 --> 14:21.900]  I mean, I don't know who was second place in republicans probably ted cruz, you know
[14:21.900 --> 14:26.860]  I mean in the altar of john k sake none of them would have done this. None of them would have done this
[14:26.860 --> 14:31.820]  None, there would have been none of these tariffs and this they still might have had a dog and pony show
[14:32.460 --> 14:38.140]  About the new assembly line here in texas because like you said it is a politically
[14:38.860 --> 14:44.940]  Good move to be saying hey, you know, we're apple and everybody, you know, we're this big successful american company
[14:44.940 --> 14:48.140]  And we are putting jobs, you know blue-collar jobs in the world
[14:48.140 --> 14:54.220]  And we are putting jobs, you know blue-collar jobs right here in the united states and and on the on the on the the
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.860]  Before I leave that
[14:57.020 --> 15:01.580]  How politically positive that message is for mainstream america
[15:01.580 --> 15:07.820]  That was actually the subject of tim cook's first on-camera interview as ceo
[15:08.620 --> 15:12.060]  So steve jobs passed away and at the end of 2011
[15:13.500 --> 15:16.380]  And I forget what time it was but it was sometime in 2012
[15:16.380 --> 15:18.380]  Where tim cook appeared on?
[15:19.500 --> 15:21.500]  Whatever the evening
[15:21.580 --> 15:24.780]  60 minutes to show is that nbc has with brian williams
[15:26.540 --> 15:33.900]  And among among many other things that have changed since 2012 brian williams stature at nbc news has changed
[15:34.540 --> 15:38.780]  Although I still like him. I actually like him a lot and feel like he kind of got a bad rap over the whole
[15:39.580 --> 15:44.460]  Exaggerating some stories thing but but anyway in an interview with brian williams, it was sort of
[15:44.460 --> 15:49.020]  Like hey, why don't you make any of these computers here in the us and tim cook's answer is well
[15:49.020 --> 15:52.060]  We're going to change that you know, and it was a positive message
[15:52.700 --> 15:56.780]  You know, it wasn't untrue. I'm not saying it was bs, you know, it kind of
[15:57.500 --> 16:04.380]  You have to know I mean in mainstream america has no idea that the mac pro sells like one thousandth of as many
[16:05.180 --> 16:11.500]  Items as macbooks, which is what everybody really thinks of when they think of max and mac macbooks sell
[16:11.500 --> 16:13.500]  mac macbooks sell
[16:14.140 --> 16:18.300]  Like 120th what they sell iphones. I mean the numbers on iphones are ridiculous
[16:18.380 --> 16:19.020]  I mean
[16:19.020 --> 16:25.340]  But it is something it is a real thing and they're doing it and it was so positive that that was tim cook's first on you
[16:25.340 --> 16:26.460]  know
[16:26.460 --> 16:32.940]  Camera interview on national tv as the ceo, uh was to deliver that message. So it's definitely positive
[16:33.660 --> 16:37.980]  Right, right and you know, I mean this is not like the first time
[16:38.620 --> 16:40.620]  either that apple has sort of uh
[16:40.620 --> 16:48.060]  Partnered, I guess with with the trump administration around this stuff. There was this it was it was kind of smaller but back in
[16:49.340 --> 16:51.020]  last year
[16:51.020 --> 16:55.900]  early early 2008 they um sort of put out this press release saying that thanks to
[16:56.460 --> 17:03.820]  The tax cuts that had passed the previous december. They were going to contribute 350 billion dollars
[17:04.620 --> 17:08.940]  To the american economy and then you know, if you if you dig into it, it was like
[17:08.940 --> 17:11.660]  I mean apple's a big company right like they do a lot of stuff
[17:11.660 --> 17:18.620]  It's it's totally true that they you know, support people's incomes and jobs, but it had nothing to do with the tax bill
[17:19.180 --> 17:22.380]  Even just the timeline didn't make sense, right? I mean apple doesn't um
[17:23.900 --> 17:28.540]  A law doesn't pass in december and then by january apple has a whole new business plan, right?
[17:28.700 --> 17:31.900]  They work on these products on a years-long timeline
[17:32.460 --> 17:35.580]  But you know the trump administration this was their signature thing
[17:35.580 --> 17:40.060]  The tax bill really did give a large tax cut to apple shareholders
[17:40.060 --> 17:44.220]  Yeah, so i'm sure tim cupk was was very happy about that. It's it's good for the share price
[17:44.220 --> 17:47.500]  it's good for the dividends, uh, and then you know, they kind of
[17:48.300 --> 17:53.260]  Tried to make it out to be the the press release has a picture of like some guy with a huge
[17:53.820 --> 17:59.900]  Sheet metal, you know fabrication plant right trying to say apple is part of the american blue collar economy
[17:59.900 --> 18:05.660]  Uh, which you know, I mean it may or may not be to some extent but it's it's nothing to do with with donald trump
[18:05.980 --> 18:11.500]  Uh, except they do they do they do like the corporate tax cut. I I think they were the single biggest
[18:12.220 --> 18:13.260]  recipient
[18:13.260 --> 18:16.140]  Of tax cuts there. I mean just because it's such a large company
[18:16.140 --> 18:21.820]  Well, and it's it's specifically because apple was in a very unique situation where they had
[18:22.700 --> 18:26.140]  I think literally hundreds of hundreds of billions of dollars
[18:26.140 --> 18:29.100]  of hundreds of billions of dollars off
[18:29.820 --> 18:31.580]  outside the us
[18:31.580 --> 18:33.580]  because
[18:33.900 --> 18:36.300]  And there are you know, I don't want to argue the politics of it
[18:36.300 --> 18:39.980]  But our apple's argument was you know for years people have been saying well
[18:39.980 --> 18:44.540]  Why don't you just bring the money in the country and pay your damn taxes, right? There's there's a huge pay your damn
[18:44.620 --> 18:48.860]  Why don't you pay your damn taxes movement rightly? So, you know the news just came out last week that
[18:49.500 --> 18:54.700]  Amazon is going to paid apparently going to pay zero dollars in taxes on 11 billion dollars in profit
[18:54.700 --> 18:58.700]  Uh, you know, it's part of apple's argument was always they they did pay taxes, right?
[18:58.700 --> 19:03.420]  It's not you know, not all their taxes, right? But apple had this mountain of cash
[19:03.500 --> 19:06.940]  I think it was literally like 250 billion dollars in cash
[19:07.340 --> 19:07.740]  uh
[19:07.740 --> 19:13.260]  Just sitting in like a bank in ireland that they it's money that they had made selling products around the world
[19:13.500 --> 19:15.500]  and they just kept them in
[19:15.980 --> 19:18.480]  the bank accounts of international subsidiaries
[19:18.480 --> 19:25.200]  And thanks to the law that the trump passed, you know in 2016. I think it was one of the first things that
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.040]  That he and the republican congress did apple was able to move that money back in the country without paying taxes on it
[19:31.120 --> 19:34.720]  And that's right. Is that a tax cut? I would argue. Yes
[19:34.960 --> 19:40.080]  It is just not the type of tax cut you tend to think of you tend to I tend to think of tax cuts as applying
[19:40.800 --> 19:42.400]  to
[19:42.400 --> 19:47.360]  They pass the tax cut and then you start benefiting from it or if it's a tax increase you start paying it
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.360]  on
[19:49.520 --> 19:51.600]  Stuff that you do from that point forward, right?
[19:51.600 --> 19:57.200]  So they pass the tax cut and then apple saves money on their profits after the tax cut was paced
[19:57.360 --> 19:59.360]  This was a tax cut where they save money
[20:00.560 --> 20:05.440]  They save money on revenue that or profit that they generated for, you know, 10 to 20 years
[20:06.560 --> 20:11.380]  Yeah, I mean they I mean they did get that that huge windfall right because they had been essentially
[20:11.380 --> 20:18.020]  Keeping this money in their mostly irish subsidiary anticipating that some kind of discount repatriation would happen
[20:18.180 --> 20:20.820]  But they also did on a forward-looking basis. I mean they're
[20:21.620 --> 20:28.100]  You know investor reports say they're they're forward-looking effective tax rate will fall by about 10 percentage points
[20:28.820 --> 20:32.500]  Um, you know, I mean, that's that's a lot of coincidence, right? I mean, yeah
[20:32.500 --> 20:36.260]  I mean, this is the you know intention of the policy
[20:36.260 --> 20:40.660]  It's supposed to make american companies more attractive put more money into them
[20:40.660 --> 20:46.820]  Uh, but you know in general if you were trying to sort of um, think of a american company
[20:47.380 --> 20:53.540]  That uh, if its profit margins went up a little bit they could finally make something happen. You know, apple's not like the
[20:54.260 --> 21:00.100]  Example you would choose right? Uh, I I I enjoy their products. I I like my all my eye stuff
[21:00.660 --> 21:06.100]  But they have enjoyed very healthy margins on these things and they had more money than you know
[21:06.100 --> 21:09.620]  Than anybody knew what to do with and also I mean it always seems like apple's
[21:09.620 --> 21:12.020]  expansion, right their
[21:13.060 --> 21:19.620]  Their ability to take on new projects is not limited by financial resources. It's limited by a
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.500]  Corporate philosophy of focus. Yeah, right like like they could go make a speaker set but like, you know
[21:26.580 --> 21:29.700]  They didn't want to and then they make the home pot, right? It's like
[21:30.500 --> 21:34.420]  It's not really about money or taxes or or anything. It's about
[21:35.140 --> 21:38.820]  How they how they're structured they're they're by far and away
[21:38.820 --> 21:45.780]  Most biggest constraint is uh talent. They just don't have and band and then and then I would argue at the same point
[21:47.060 --> 21:49.060]  the bandwidth of
[21:49.300 --> 21:52.100]  upper management where there's only
[21:53.140 --> 21:55.140]  So many people who are truly
[21:55.380 --> 22:00.660]  You know running the company they can only they can only supervise so many product projects products
[22:00.660 --> 22:04.500]  Whatever you want to say they and money is not the problem. They if money were the problem man
[22:04.500 --> 22:06.500]  They they'd have they'd have everything by now
[22:06.500 --> 22:11.140]  That have a car they don't split stuff off right like like a lot of companies are just these kind of big
[22:11.540 --> 22:16.340]  Comcomerants and some guy will just run some unit off there with nothing to do with anybody else
[22:16.340 --> 22:23.140]  But apple's not like that. It's a very integrated management team right on a top level. They have a design department
[22:23.700 --> 22:29.940]  Right that handles everything and so as you say it means they only have bandwidth to do so much at once to take on
[22:29.940 --> 22:31.940]  So many new kinds of things
[22:31.940 --> 22:39.060]  Which is good. I mean, it's it's why they maintain, you know, a generally consistent high quality except for this fucking keyboard
[22:40.580 --> 22:45.380]  But you know, but it's why it's so striking. It's why people have been talking about it for years
[22:45.380 --> 22:48.660]  But anyway, you know, there's just no reason to think that that
[22:49.380 --> 22:51.380]  Apple's not a good political
[22:51.700 --> 22:55.380]  Case for this tax bill, but they were one of the biggest winners
[22:55.620 --> 22:59.540]  And they they really went all out to try to make make trump look good on it
[22:59.540 --> 23:05.140]  And then the bigger thing though is not the tariff waivers. They got to build them at pro
[23:05.380 --> 23:10.820]  But the tariff waivers they're asking for yeah for new tariffs that aren't going to come in
[23:11.540 --> 23:15.700]  Until december 15th, but in theory all this stuff
[23:16.580 --> 23:17.780]  airpods
[23:17.780 --> 23:18.900]  macbooks
[23:18.900 --> 23:20.820]  iphones ipads
[23:20.820 --> 23:27.220]  Probably even this battery case is all going to be hit with the the next round of tariffs on chinese
[23:27.220 --> 23:32.500]  next round of tariffs on chinese imports and that would be a disaster for apple
[23:33.300 --> 23:34.340]  it's
[23:34.340 --> 23:36.820]  and again, it's a little outside my realm, but
[23:37.460 --> 23:42.420]  I read ben thompson ben thompson had a great piece as stratechery, uh daily update
[23:42.740 --> 23:44.180]  uh
[23:44.180 --> 23:46.260]  My last few days have been it's been weird
[23:46.260 --> 23:50.280]  I forget if it was yesterday or the day before but I think it was yesterday and I think basically
[23:50.280 --> 23:57.720]  The analysts think that if the tariffs december 15th tariffs come in and apply to apple as they would right now
[23:57.960 --> 24:01.640]  without a waiver it would require them to raise the retail price of
[24:02.520 --> 24:07.480]  Their products by about five percent if they wanted to maintain the same profit margins
[24:08.760 --> 24:10.040]  I think it's very clear
[24:10.040 --> 24:14.840]  I think apple considers pricing to be such a strong part of the brand of its products
[24:15.160 --> 24:19.080]  That they would probably keep the prices the same and take the hit on the margin
[24:19.080 --> 24:21.720]  But one way or the other it's bad news because clearly
[24:23.080 --> 24:29.640]  You raise the price it's going to affect demand. I mean, that's literally like first day of economics 101
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.280]  and uh
[24:32.280 --> 24:33.320]  you
[24:33.320 --> 24:34.600]  People do not
[24:34.600 --> 24:36.600]  apple has conditioned investors
[24:37.160 --> 24:40.760]  To expect 38 percent profit margins
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.600]  Every quarter quarter after quarter. It's actually in my opinion rather uncanny
[24:46.600 --> 24:53.560]  How consistent their margins are. I don't think there's any funny business on that because of all the things that you
[24:54.440 --> 24:55.800]  fudge
[24:55.800 --> 24:58.120]  In financial statements the actually, you know
[24:58.120 --> 25:02.600]  The fluctuation of the profit margin is not one of them that i've never heard of anybody, you know
[25:02.600 --> 25:09.000]  Going to jail for an sec violation because they fudge the profit margins. I mean you fudge revenue or you fudge pro
[25:09.560 --> 25:10.600]  but
[25:10.600 --> 25:12.680]  37 and a half to 38
[25:12.680 --> 25:19.480]  And a half to 38 every single quarter after quarter after quarter and sometimes they'll even offer guidance and they'll say
[25:19.560 --> 25:21.880]  Ah, we might we might be down to 36 next quarter
[25:21.960 --> 25:28.680]  You guys be worried and then here the results come out 37.7 profit margin. It is unbelievably consistent
[25:28.920 --> 25:32.680]  But like you said with 37 profit margin across the board
[25:33.080 --> 25:37.320]  It's kind of hard to be sympathetic to them that they you know that they're on the razor's edge
[25:38.600 --> 25:40.360]  Yeah
[25:40.360 --> 25:43.960]  Well also, I mean this is why it's politically interesting, right?
[25:43.960 --> 25:46.760]  I mean this i had to go a little outside the talk show normal
[25:47.080 --> 25:50.520]  Ambit, right so it's like trump. He wants to do a trade war with china, right?
[25:50.840 --> 25:56.680]  so he's putting tariffs on all kinds of things and then he has to watch his domestic politics because
[25:57.080 --> 26:00.680]  Tariffs can raise prices for american consumers, right?
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.840]  And if you go to the store to buy christmas presents for your kids and everything suddenly costs 10 15 more
[26:06.840 --> 26:11.480]  Like you're gonna be pissed you're gonna you're gonna yell at donald trump. That's not gonna help him
[26:12.120 --> 26:18.760]  So if you think about it, probably like the best company to hit with these tariffs would be apple
[26:19.560 --> 26:22.600]  Because as you say apple has huge profit margins, right?
[26:22.920 --> 26:28.280]  So they can actually afford to just pay the tariff like they're not going to be happy about it
[26:28.280 --> 26:33.160]  But you know, they always talk in their in their earnings calls. I don't know. Do you do you get on the earnings calls?
[26:33.400 --> 26:34.520]  No
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.360]  Right. They there's always some section about exchange rate
[26:39.320 --> 26:40.920]  Yes, because this is a similar thing, right?
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.160]  So if the dollar gets weaker gets stronger compared to the euro
[26:45.560 --> 26:52.760]  Then they make less money selling uh selling the phones and stuff there. They normally don't adjust the prices year to year
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.720]  They have what they think is the right price for a flagship phone in in europe
[26:57.800 --> 27:01.640]  they have the right price for a macbook and they stick to it because
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.960]  I mean, I don't know, you know apple just doesn't do a lot of price shenanigans, right? There's no like
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.960]  Black friday sales usually at least not the major stuff. So their margins go up and down and
[27:12.680 --> 27:15.640]  They live with it right unless there's a huge change. Um
[27:16.280 --> 27:22.120]  So if they got the tariff like they would just pay the tariff and it would be a ton of money because they sell a
[27:22.280 --> 27:24.280]  ton of freaking phones, right?
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.280]  And if you were trump you might think okay, like that's a that's a trade war success story, right?
[27:30.280 --> 27:32.680]  Right. I am now telling apple
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.120]  Hey, look, if you want to get your margins back up, you need to find a way to make this stuff in america
[27:38.520 --> 27:40.840]  but what ben thompson pointed out was that
[27:41.880 --> 27:47.800]  You know tim cook has been sounding really confident. Yes that he's gonna get these waivers
[27:48.440 --> 27:50.200]  um and
[27:50.200 --> 27:54.040]  You have to imagine that that was in the mix for these
[27:54.040 --> 28:01.820]  These conversations here, uh, you never know. I mean, there's not the impeachment hearings, uh, but you know, how explicit was the quid pro quo?
[28:02.220 --> 28:09.020]  Who knew what what kind of little message were being sold but it really seems like that is the game here that you know
[28:09.420 --> 28:14.700]  Tim cook would really like waivers for the whole rest of the apple product line
[28:14.940 --> 28:19.340]  Trump is inclined to give them to him if apple can do him some favors
[28:19.980 --> 28:21.980]  Tim cook is a very hard
[28:21.980 --> 28:26.860]  Uh character to read I would be terrified to play poker against him
[28:26.940 --> 28:31.980]  Even if we set table even if we set the table stakes at a limit that i'm comfortable with
[28:31.980 --> 28:34.460]  you know putting aside that tim cook going all in would be
[28:35.420 --> 28:38.380]  A lot more than I can go all in for i'm just saying
[28:38.620 --> 28:42.300]  that if we were playing poker I would be terrified to play with him because I don't think
[28:42.620 --> 28:47.020]  You could get a read on him one way or the other the guy it really has a poker face
[28:47.580 --> 28:50.540]  Uh, and I want to i'll come back to that in a bit
[28:50.540 --> 28:52.060]  But in a way, you know in a way
[28:52.060 --> 28:57.980]  He's the opposite of steve jobs where steve jobs was very easy to read and really had had a very hard time
[28:58.940 --> 29:00.940]  hiding his true emotions
[29:03.340 --> 29:06.060]  Tim cook does and he also
[29:06.780 --> 29:09.580]  Is very careful. I I would say that that is
[29:10.220 --> 29:17.180]  You know by all accounts one of the first adjectives anybody would ever apply to him. He's a very careful
[29:17.180 --> 29:20.060]  cautious person he's chooses his words
[29:21.100 --> 29:23.100]  in public
[29:23.180 --> 29:25.340]  You can almost see him thinking about them
[29:25.340 --> 29:32.460]  They're very cautious and and they often come across as very anodyne if he wants them to be where there's just not much there there
[29:34.140 --> 29:40.140]  And again, it does like you said it comes down to some of the stuff with the quid pro quo stuff where you know and you
[29:40.140 --> 29:41.020]  know
[29:41.020 --> 29:43.820]  Trump is literally and his defenders literally want to say well
[29:43.820 --> 29:47.580]  He never actually said the words quid pro quo and never even heard of them before
[29:48.540 --> 29:54.460]  Uh, so therefore there couldn't have been a quid pro quo even though it's just it's just a word
[29:54.460 --> 29:57.420]  He asked for a thing in exchange for another thing, which is
[29:58.460 --> 30:00.460]  Quid pro quo. That's the meaning of it, right?
[30:02.460 --> 30:08.060]  So, yeah, I get that so I don't listen to the earnings calls, but I always read the transcripts afterwards
[30:08.060 --> 30:10.780]  That's my thing is I can't they go too slow for me. So I I
[30:10.780 --> 30:15.420]  Yeah, I just wait and the people who bang out the transcripts, uh, like jason snell
[30:15.980 --> 30:20.060]  They have them out so fast that I feel like I haven't even lost anything even if something really
[30:20.700 --> 30:26.140]  Important happened in it. I'm only like an hour behind right, but you read it you read his answer and it didn't
[30:26.860 --> 30:31.020]  It didn't seem like a like the most famous example people keep bringing it up
[30:31.020 --> 30:33.740]  But there's the famous example of like in a protection racket
[30:34.540 --> 30:37.260]  Uh, the local mob comes into your flower shop
[30:37.260 --> 30:41.740]  Uh, and so this is a real nice flower shop you got here, you know be ashamed if something happened to it, you know
[30:41.740 --> 30:43.740]  Maybe you want to maybe want to protect it
[30:44.780 --> 30:48.860]  Uh, they didn't say anything out. Yeah, right and then you know, you bust them you say we got a recording of it
[30:48.860 --> 30:51.740]  You're like, yeah, I just like going into shops and telling them how nice they are
[30:51.740 --> 30:55.740]  And I really would think it's a shame if something happened to it, right, but that's a threat. That's a you know
[30:56.620 --> 30:58.620]  Uh cook doesn't talk like that
[30:58.620 --> 31:03.740]  So like cook's confidence is easy to overlook but you really just look at it and as ben pointed out
[31:03.740 --> 31:07.340]  He really did seem to be saying yeah, don't worry about that
[31:08.300 --> 31:12.140]  right, I think we're gonna be okay on these waivers and
[31:13.180 --> 31:15.180]  You know
[31:16.060 --> 31:19.340]  You know, it seems like they delivered their end, uh, yep
[31:20.300 --> 31:22.220]  and you know, it's
[31:22.220 --> 31:24.620]  It's it's it's part of a bigger
[31:25.580 --> 31:31.180]  Problem I think for apple going forward given how invested they are in
[31:31.180 --> 31:35.340]  given how invested they are in manufacturing in china
[31:35.820 --> 31:40.860]  um, it leaves them vulnerable to this kind of stuff from trump, but also
[31:41.660 --> 31:43.660]  the the whole u.s. Chinese
[31:43.880 --> 31:50.220]  Relationship is is going downhill, uh for reasons that are that are bigger than trump, right? There's this constant
[31:51.180 --> 31:58.400]  Now a concern about this this chinese company huawei that makes I mean they make phones but they also make all this networking infrastructure
[31:58.400 --> 32:05.380]  Yeah, um a lot of it the democrats running for for president are not, you know, enthusiastic free traders
[32:06.080 --> 32:13.440]  And then of course the chinese themselves have been you know, making trouble with the the what was it that the taiwanese flag?
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.160]  Yeah, um this hong kong app
[32:17.040 --> 32:22.560]  You know all the tech companies deal with this in one way or another but you know facebook doesn't really operate
[32:22.560 --> 32:28.880]  In china and apple really operates in china like both on the sales and the production side
[32:29.280 --> 32:34.240]  Uh, and you know, I mean cook is not I guess he's not sweating this this round of tariffs
[32:34.320 --> 32:37.120]  But he's taking a lot of crap from people over it
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.760]  I think rightly so and you know
[32:39.760 --> 32:45.120]  You have to wonder uh how they're how they're thinking about this for the for the longer term because like trump may pass
[32:45.120 --> 32:50.480]  But I don't think you know us china tensions are going to and the the chinese government, you know
[32:50.480 --> 32:56.240]  This is like way outside my area, but they don't seem to be getting any nicer. No, they do not
[32:57.200 --> 33:02.660]  Right. Yeah, um, there was also and it's it's a side issue and maybe coincidental
[33:02.880 --> 33:05.760]  But did you see this a couple of months ago?
[33:06.480 --> 33:09.300]  There was a google-led team of researchers
[33:10.160 --> 33:14.080]  issued a report on a vulnerability in iphones and
[33:14.640 --> 33:16.080]  that
[33:16.080 --> 33:23.760]  it long story short they didn't name the country but it came out afterwards that it was the chinese government was using it to
[33:24.560 --> 33:28.740]  Using this exploit to target people with the in this huger situation
[33:30.240 --> 33:32.240]  In china where this is a group of people
[33:33.120 --> 33:37.120]  Who millions of people and they've got you know, china is putting them
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.500]  Into concentration camps. I mean, that's no exaggeration
[33:40.500 --> 33:46.500]  It it's really just awful. The new york times has done a bunch of reporting on it recently about the conditions in these camps
[33:47.460 --> 33:52.820]  Um and apple issued a press response to this google story
[33:55.140 --> 33:57.140]  Which was to me tone-deaf
[33:57.540 --> 34:05.140]  Because it really didn't express any sympathy to the huger people whom it was used against
[34:05.140 --> 34:10.580]  It was sort of well, it didn't happen in the u.s. It was only the hugers. I mean i'm paraphrasing here
[34:10.660 --> 34:17.460]  but the gist of it was it's only these hugers in china who were actually affected by it and we fixed it and
[34:17.940 --> 34:21.140]  Google conveniently didn't mention that it affected android phones, too
[34:22.020 --> 34:26.020]  And android phones are more popular in china than the iphone or something, you know something to that effect
[34:26.260 --> 34:31.140]  Yeah, I mean it was a good it was a good slap back at google. Yeah, like narrowly, right?
[34:31.140 --> 34:36.580]  Right, but but also apple is the company that's trying to sell us on privacy features. Yeah
[34:36.660 --> 34:40.740]  Yeah, I mean that's that's like their pitch and it's like a reasonable pitch
[34:41.300 --> 34:44.660]  But it means that you know showing applause in it, you know
[34:45.220 --> 34:51.380]  It means a lot and also as you say right, I mean, so this is the the Uyghur population. It's like 10 million people
[34:52.100 --> 34:57.620]  They're muslims. They speak a turkic language instead of a chinese language and
[34:57.620 --> 34:59.620]  And uh
[35:00.020 --> 35:05.300]  I mean if you if you read this stuff in the times and elsewhere, it's it's totally appalling
[35:05.300 --> 35:11.060]  I mean, they're trying to completely stamp out. Yeah this culture this this society and
[35:11.620 --> 35:14.660]  Yeah, I mean it's not in the united states. Um, but
[35:15.380 --> 35:17.380]  And and I don't know how much
[35:17.460 --> 35:21.780]  Apple or anyone outside of china could actually do about it
[35:21.780 --> 35:27.700]  But like any decent person I think would not want to be involved in any way
[35:27.860 --> 35:31.620]  Yeah, and this kind of crackdown if there's if there's anything at all you can do
[35:32.180 --> 35:35.620]  and so my my my point on this issue with the Uyghur thing and the
[35:35.860 --> 35:41.800]  Security vulnerability and this sort of callous or or maybe not callous, but just unsympathetic
[35:43.380 --> 35:48.580]  Public response is that if you're looking for signs that apple is going out of its way not to
[35:48.580 --> 35:52.100]  Even potentially anger chinese government officials
[35:52.740 --> 35:54.100]  You could
[35:54.100 --> 35:58.020]  Now maybe it just didn't occur to them and maybe they were really just pissed
[35:58.180 --> 36:04.100]  About the way that it looked like this exploit was only against iphones and not android and it happened to be a google
[36:04.500 --> 36:10.260]  Research team that issued the report and they I think that there was even I forget what the issue was the news of the day
[36:10.260 --> 36:14.020]  But google even had some bad some bad news that week about something
[36:14.020 --> 36:18.500]  And so isn't it convenient that they issued this report on ios security?
[36:19.460 --> 36:24.420]  Don't mention android and did it at a time that was seemingly convenient for google and the tech news cycle
[36:25.140 --> 36:28.600]  Yeah, not mentioning and putting in a very sympathetic
[36:29.540 --> 36:31.540]  uh stance on the Uyghurs
[36:31.780 --> 36:36.660]  You know it maybe it just didn't occur to them, but maybe it did and they thought well why why piss off china?
[36:36.660 --> 36:41.060]  You know that seems like something that's going to piss them off. It's besides beside the point we want to make
[36:41.060 --> 36:43.060]  Beside the point we want to make
[36:43.300 --> 36:48.120]  Again, wouldn't have helped wouldn't have gotten one person out of a concentration camp wouldn't have softened
[36:49.460 --> 36:53.380]  The chinese government's truly cruel stance towards this entire community
[36:54.260 --> 36:55.780]  of 10 million people
[36:55.780 --> 37:01.700]  But it still would have been I think the right thing to do in your your statement on this to apologize to the to these
[37:01.780 --> 37:03.780]  People who are truly going through something bad
[37:03.780 --> 37:10.580]  Yeah, and I mean I I also I mean I found this this flag thing kind of alarming right where this is
[37:10.580 --> 37:18.340]  They they took the taiwanese flag emoji out of the ios localization in hong kong. Yeah, uh, which is
[37:19.220 --> 37:23.700]  Hold that thought let's come back. Let's come back to this flag thing after I take a break here and thank our first sponsor
[37:23.700 --> 37:26.740]  Because that's a good point. I want to keep going on this but that's a good point that i'll remember
[37:27.140 --> 37:30.660]  I want to thank our first sponsor my good friends at hello pillow
[37:30.660 --> 37:33.300]  pillow h u l l o
[37:33.860 --> 37:37.300]  And then they spell pillow normally have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow?
[37:37.460 --> 37:41.620]  It is a totally different experience than the fluffy soft pillows that most of us
[37:42.260 --> 37:48.900]  Are used to it's similar to a beanbag very similar in my personal experience which allows you to adjust its shape and thickness
[37:49.140 --> 37:50.820]  It supports your head and neck
[37:50.820 --> 37:55.300]  Just how you want to unlike traditional squishy soft pillows, which collapse into the weight of your head
[37:55.300 --> 38:00.100]  Soft pillows allow your neck to fall into a downward bend adding on uncomfort
[38:01.380 --> 38:07.220]  Uncomfortable pressure to muscles nerves and discs. Hello. On the other hand a hello pillow stays cool and dry
[38:07.620 --> 38:09.860]  Compared to regular pillows filled with feathers or foam
[38:10.740 --> 38:13.540]  You don't have to flip it over them in the middle of the night to get the cool side
[38:14.100 --> 38:19.860]  The side you've been sleeping on stays the cool side all night long. It makes your pillow feel warm and humid without getting hot
[38:20.820 --> 38:23.700]  Buckwheat pillows just simply just tend to breathe better
[38:23.700 --> 38:29.540]  Uh, they sent me one years ago when they first sponsored the show my wife claimed it has never given it up since
[38:30.100 --> 38:36.020]  We now have hello pillows in every bed in the house. Uh, they my wife and son absolutely
[38:36.740 --> 38:41.060]  Love them love to come home from a vacation. We could stay somewhere with really nice hotel beds
[38:41.220 --> 38:43.940]  First thing they like when they come home is that they get back to a hello pillow
[38:44.340 --> 38:48.900]  Somebody tweeted about that once and a hello. Hello representative said, you know, you can take them on the road
[38:48.900 --> 38:50.900]  But they are actually kind of heavy
[38:50.900 --> 38:54.100]  It's actually the type of pillow that would be hard to pack. Uh,
[38:54.820 --> 38:56.500]  Really? It's a great product
[38:56.500 --> 39:00.900]  And if you're the type of person who uses two regular pillows or folds your pillow or something like that to pop it up
[39:01.140 --> 39:07.540]  A one hello pillow will do the trick for you and keep you propped up at the proper opening you can adjust them
[39:07.940 --> 39:09.380]  the obvious way
[39:09.380 --> 39:15.460]  Unzip it take a little out if you want a little flatter put some more buckwheat in there if you want it a little puffier
[39:16.100 --> 39:18.100]  it's really a natural way to sleep and
[39:18.100 --> 39:22.580]  On point for this episode of the show hello products are made in the usa
[39:23.300 --> 39:29.140]  With quality construction and materials certified organic cotton case is cut and sewn for durability
[39:29.140 --> 39:31.940]  And the buckwheat is grown and milled in the u.s
[39:32.980 --> 39:38.820]  So you can sleep on it for 60 nights. You have almost two months and the if you don't like it just send it back
[39:38.820 --> 39:42.280]  They'll give you a full refund. No questions asked go to hello pillow.com
[39:42.280 --> 39:50.280]  Talk show hello pillow h-u-l-l-o pillow dot com slash talk show and if you try more than one pillow
[39:50.920 --> 39:55.480]  You get a discount of up to 20 bucks per pillow depending on the size
[39:55.880 --> 40:01.260]  Fast free shipping on every order or two and one percent of profits are donated to the nature conservancy
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.520]  My thanks to hello pillow
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.360]  So the flag emoji thing tell so the basic story there is china is a
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.500]  So the basic story there is china is very sensitive
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.040]  To issues surrounding sovereignty. Uh
[40:18.840 --> 40:24.600]  And you know what we can touch on another uh mutual you're a much bigger nba fan than I am but the nba
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.280]  found itself in hot water on the same issue, but
[40:29.400 --> 40:36.360]  They're keenly aware of issues pertaining to sovereignty and it's partially what drives them to
[40:37.080 --> 40:39.080]  Have these campaigns like in tibet
[40:39.080 --> 40:45.800]  And with the hugers where they're saying, you know, you you are chinese. This is china, right?
[40:46.120 --> 40:48.120]  You know that sort of mindset
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.040]  um
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.040]  And they're very sensitive to this they they I think i'm going to get it wrong
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.280]  It's a shame because we were just talking about them, but I always forget what what taiwan's
[40:59.320 --> 41:04.600]  Other name republic of china. It's like right. I was going to guess that the republic of china. So the
[41:04.600 --> 41:13.800]  uh, the republic of china is taiwan and it's a democracy and it's it's it is not china, but china sort of
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Wants you to think it's china and
[41:17.640 --> 41:20.760]  they've done some weird things over the years like
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.200]  They they've insisted that airlines around the world
[41:24.840 --> 41:28.200]  List taiwan as the republic of china. Yeah
[41:28.200 --> 41:35.400]  I think they made them play in the olympics as chinese formosa or something some some other historic name for it
[41:35.400 --> 41:39.480]  Yeah, and now yeah, and so and so they have their own flag
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.200]  as one does right, but
[41:42.520 --> 41:50.600]  The apple mysteriously and apple has these flag emojis people probably seen it. You gotta scroll down there and it it went away
[41:51.560 --> 41:53.560]  In the hong kong
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.640]  Um in the hong kong localization, um, I guess it was never in the chinese one probably
[42:00.360 --> 42:01.160]  No
[42:01.160 --> 42:05.960]  No, probably not almost certainly not and that's like a it's a slap at taiwan. But also
[42:07.560 --> 42:11.320]  I I really don't know all the nuances of the hong kong protest situation
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.920]  but hong kong has a different legal situation in which people are supposed to have
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.560]  the kind of free speech rights that they had when it was part of the the british empire rather than
[42:21.560 --> 42:24.680]  uh, what what exists in china and
[42:25.400 --> 42:31.480]  What's particularly weird about this right is is apple just did it right you were you know, tim kok
[42:31.480 --> 42:36.680]  He says well china doesn't pressure us. Uh, you gotta figure china did pressure them, but
[42:37.400 --> 42:43.320]  Maybe china didn't pressure them and they're just trying to be nice go out of the way to censor taiwanese flags
[42:43.960 --> 42:46.600]  but and it was weird too because it happened in like
[42:46.600 --> 42:51.900]  One of the eight updates to ios 13. It wasn't like ios 13.0
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.600]  Came out and here's the major new version of ios 13 and now there's no more flag
[42:58.920 --> 43:01.240]  Uh, taiwanese flag emoji in hong kong
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.200]  It was just like a you know, like 13.1.1 or something like that came out
[43:06.200 --> 43:10.920]  And if you had your region set to hong kong, you couldn't type the the flag emoji
[43:10.920 --> 43:17.180]  The flag emoji, but also weird is they didn't remove the emoji. They removed it from the keyboard
[43:17.560 --> 43:19.960]  so you can type it but if you
[43:21.320 --> 43:24.680]  In the us version of or any of the other various
[43:25.300 --> 43:30.040]  Locals around the world where it remains on the keyboard if you send it to somebody in hong kong
[43:30.120 --> 43:34.280]  They will receive it and it will still display. It's just they can't type it back
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.000]  But they could cop they could copy and paste it back, you know, it's that
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.600]  that
[43:40.600 --> 43:44.120]  It's weird enough that some people speculated at first that it was a bug
[43:44.200 --> 43:50.280]  But it's one of those things where it's like well of all the countries in all the world where this bug could happen
[43:50.360 --> 43:54.860]  It seems oddly curious that it would be the one where it's actually politically
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.600]  Sensitive, you know, it's not like the moroccan flag vanishes in namibia and you're like, yeah
[44:01.640 --> 44:03.160]  Yeah
[44:03.160 --> 44:08.120]  All of a sudden, you know, the mexican flag is no longer available, but only if you're in ireland
[44:08.120 --> 44:11.400]  It's it was not like that. It was very specific
[44:12.040 --> 44:16.120]  But on and also there have been we've seen a whole bunch of bug fix
[44:16.680 --> 44:20.680]  Bug fixes to ios 13 come out it had this has not changed yet
[44:21.400 --> 44:23.640]  Um, I know firsthand from people
[44:24.920 --> 44:29.320]  Who have family in hong kong some readers of the site, you know who who've you know
[44:29.320 --> 44:33.400]  Texted me or emailed me or dme or something like that it people in hong kong are pissed about it
[44:33.400 --> 44:35.000]  They're pissed about a lot of things about china
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.440]  But they're pissed about this keyboard thing in particular because there's a lot of them who who are even from taiwan
[44:40.600 --> 44:43.560]  You know and that now they just live in hong kong. It's their country
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.240]  uh
[44:45.240 --> 44:49.160]  you know and if you think about it that way if you think that there was some sort of
[44:50.600 --> 44:54.920]  A political problem and it's almost hard to imagine it happening in the us, but if there was something
[44:55.560 --> 45:01.000]  Where you suspected that apple removed the ability to type the italian flag?
[45:01.000 --> 45:08.440]  In on your iphone that italian americans would be very angry about it, right and rightly
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.000]  So i'm not even saying yeah, you would think but if you just think about it that way if you think you know
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.640]  If you're trying to put your hands your your your feet in the shoes of someone in hong kong
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.920]  Think about like, you know, or if you are greek heritage or whatever your background is
[45:23.640 --> 45:25.640]  um
[45:25.640 --> 45:31.400]  You know, you might be upset especially if you still have a lot of feelings and pride about your your family's home country
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.720]  And so for a lot of people in hong kong it is taiwan and now they can't type the flag and it looks like apple
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.640]  is just
[45:37.640 --> 45:38.360]  You know
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.520]  Airing on nasaia certainly isn't what people in hong kong want if anybody's happy about it
[45:42.520 --> 45:45.960]  It's people in china, but they're not the ones who are affected by it because it's the people in hong kong
[45:46.040 --> 45:48.040]  Who have the hong kong region iphones?
[45:48.680 --> 45:52.040]  Yeah, and you know part of what's disturbing about you know
[45:52.040 --> 45:54.920]  this kind of thing is that you don't know where the
[45:55.640 --> 45:59.800]  The limit is right. I mean, it's it's a small thing, right, you know
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.920]  It's an emoji. It's it's a keyboard. It's a phone. It's it's one small city
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.800]  But you know if china calls them up one day and they say well, you know, taiwan is not
[46:10.200 --> 46:17.880]  Recognized as an independent country by the un in other official bodies. Uh, so we want you to take their flag off
[46:17.880 --> 46:25.880]  Emoji keyboards all around the world like what's apple gonna do right? Because you know, well, frankly like
[46:27.960 --> 46:35.000]  The ability to use a chinese a taiwanese flag emoji is not like a make or break feature for a typical consumer
[46:35.480 --> 46:41.880]  Around the world right? They they like ios. They like the phone. They like, uh, the cameras like they're they're really good
[46:41.880 --> 46:46.760]  It's the best way to take pictures of your kids, right? So are you gonna stop buying the phone?
[46:46.760 --> 46:53.560]  Because some random flag goes away and there's a lot of money at stake in the chinese market in the chinese production line
[46:54.120 --> 46:56.120]  But you also like to think
[46:56.920 --> 46:58.920]  That you know companies will um
[46:59.640 --> 47:03.880]  Stand up for like some kind of principle that you know people
[47:04.600 --> 47:07.880]  Even if china is going to do whatever they're going to do their government's going to do in the lane
[47:07.880 --> 47:09.880]  They control that you know, we here in america
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.800]  People and people in europe people in latin america that you know
[47:13.800 --> 47:20.360]  We live in societies with free speech and and that's what happened with the nba thing. Essentially is china reached
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.960]  Through its importance to the international basketball market to shut down
[47:26.600 --> 47:29.720]  You know discussion in in the united states, right?
[47:30.520 --> 47:36.200]  Yeah, and it was a sign of like I you know, I really think it's alarming I do is that
[47:37.320 --> 47:41.240]  You know like in the 90s with bill clinton and you know, it was
[47:41.240 --> 47:47.160]  That that's when the turnout, you know, the handover from british colonial rule to china was of hong kong
[47:48.840 --> 47:50.840]  It's when trade relations
[47:51.400 --> 47:56.840]  Deepened and we started treating them at least economically like, you know part of the club
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.720]  And the thinking was
[47:59.720 --> 48:06.440]  Once they get a taste of western liberal democracy through these economic things then it's going to help open up the country
[48:06.440 --> 48:13.000]  You know, it's in my opinion in hindsight clearly arrogant on our part that once you get a taste of our style
[48:13.640 --> 48:15.640]  You you won't go back
[48:15.640 --> 48:23.160]  Uh, whereas what's actually happened is that chinese-style censorship is exporting out of china more than
[48:24.200 --> 48:31.000]  Our freedom of speech is going in right like there's there's that whole nba situation was about saying that
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.080]  If you work in the mba, you can't say you support hong kongers that that's crazy
[48:37.960 --> 48:39.640]  That's really crazy
[48:39.640 --> 48:47.080]  And there was you know, there was tremendous optimism about the internet specifically right that china is going to want to be a wealthy modern
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.840]  Technologically advanced society so they're going to have to have the internet and on the internet, you know
[48:53.400 --> 48:58.360]  No one can control anything and uh, I don't know. I mean the internet is wonderful
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.560]  I love the internet i'm right there every day. It's it's it's my whole life. You and I have made careers on the internet
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.840]  Exactly. The internet is great. Um, and and
[49:07.640 --> 49:14.120]  But we've seen that that forecast for china in particular. It was really really really wrong
[49:14.440 --> 49:20.680]  And it was uh, very feasible to create a censored internet in china. Yeah, and they they are very
[49:21.400 --> 49:25.560]  Modern technologically advanced society, right? I mean, this is how we started so much
[49:25.560 --> 49:32.280]  Of modern digital life runs on chinese hardware and you know, they're they have not had
[49:32.840 --> 49:34.200]  that many
[49:34.200 --> 49:42.220]  Globally successful sort of software oriented companies, uh, but there is tik tok which is big now and at least domestically
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.040]  uh, you know
[49:44.040 --> 49:48.520]  We chat and whatever it's you know, it works fine
[49:48.520 --> 49:55.080]  uh, not on a political level or a free speech level or a human rights level, but the technology turns out to be
[49:55.400 --> 50:02.060]  Much more, you know agnostic. Uh, I think then then people wanted to believe and the business relationship
[50:02.760 --> 50:04.760]  Turns it around the other way
[50:04.760 --> 50:08.760]  Yeah, where we underestimated just how much
[50:09.960 --> 50:11.960]  Uh
[50:11.960 --> 50:15.960]  Western not just americans, but you know, western media, you know, uh,
[50:15.960 --> 50:19.960]  Western not just americans, but you know western business people will
[50:20.920 --> 50:22.360]  break with
[50:22.360 --> 50:24.200]  our society's
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.040]  Norms and standards for things like free speech in order to make a buck
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.200]  To be honest, right? I mean and the nba thing made that so crystal clear like again
[50:35.080 --> 50:38.360]  It's sort of like making a big deal out of emoji because you know, they're just emoji
[50:38.440 --> 50:44.040]  They're literally drawn in a humorous cartoonish style. You know, it seems like such a petty little thing
[50:44.040 --> 50:46.040]  although I think like as somebody is
[50:46.440 --> 50:49.020]  Mildly interested in linguistics. It's actually fascinating
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.720]  You know, uh the way people communicate with them, but that's a that's a whole nother podcast. Um, you know, it's basketball
[50:55.720 --> 50:57.560]  It's a sport, you know and and the whole
[50:58.200 --> 51:04.220]  Uh reason you know that that people who hate sports get annoyed at people who talk about sports is it's insignificant
[51:04.440 --> 51:11.240]  And to me part of the reason why I love sports is because it's insignificant and it's exciting. It's fun to watch something
[51:11.240 --> 51:15.400]  With very highly skilled people where the stakes don't matter like i'm like
[51:15.960 --> 51:20.760]  I'll get all terribly worked up about the yankees in the postseason and feel terrible that they got knocked out again
[51:20.920 --> 51:23.400]  But the truth is nobody died. Nobody's hurt
[51:23.720 --> 51:27.720]  you know, it's just a game the fact that it's just a game, you know is what drives it but
[51:28.520 --> 51:35.640]  Yeah, the nba controversy in china was such great a microcosm of the whole thing because it was all about the money and everybody said
[51:35.640 --> 51:40.280]  It was about about the money. You didn't have to read between the lines china said if you know if you guys if you guys
[51:40.280 --> 51:42.840]  If you guys don't apologize and fire this guy, we're going to take
[51:43.640 --> 51:46.760]  We're going to stop showing nba games in china and they met it
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.360]  And they immediately stopped the broadcast of a couple of preseason games that were meant to be broadcast there
[51:52.600 --> 51:59.420]  And the sneaker companies sell tons and you know, I guess billions of dollars billions of dollars of sneakers and jerseys
[52:00.120 --> 52:02.120]  for the top stars
[52:03.480 --> 52:05.480]  You know the the financial
[52:05.480 --> 52:12.140]  ramifications are just obvious and china waved them in front of the nba's eyes and said hey you want our money in this market you'll
[52:12.140 --> 52:15.580]  Do it and the nba I have to give it to the commissioner. What's his name?
[52:17.180 --> 52:23.340]  Who's the nba it's it's not david stern anymore. I know I can I can only remember david stern. Yeah
[52:23.900 --> 52:26.060]  He was commissioner for so long. Yeah
[52:27.340 --> 52:34.940]  Uh adam silver adam silver. I thought his response overall was great and he did stand up for free speech and he didn't insist
[52:34.940 --> 52:39.340]  You know, they stood up for the executive in houston and said we're not going to insist he'd be fired
[52:40.060 --> 52:43.180]  Uh, I think he handled the diplomacy of it very well
[52:43.820 --> 52:50.380]  By yeah by maintaining saying that the nba stands for free speech, you know, uh, I appreciate that
[52:50.380 --> 52:56.620]  I really think that he's it's just a it just shows that it's the best run of the major sport leagues and in the u.s
[52:57.420 --> 52:58.780]  um
[52:58.780 --> 53:04.780]  But it was so weird to see like nba players, you know refusing like if it was me man, I would again
[53:04.780 --> 53:08.380]  I don't have a 30 million dollar shoe contract to defend it
[53:08.380 --> 53:11.900]  maybe I would feel differently if I did right, but i'd like to think that I
[53:12.380 --> 53:16.860]  It would make me want to say I stand with hong kong even if I didn't even know what the hell was going on in
[53:16.860 --> 53:21.260]  Hong kong i'd be like I stand with hong kong, you know, and here I come to play my preseason game
[53:21.740 --> 53:25.100]  It was incredible. I mean a lot of the players high profile players were
[53:25.800 --> 53:33.020]  clearly clearly pissed not at china but uh at at this this rockets gm for
[53:33.020 --> 53:35.100]  making trouble for them and and that was
[53:35.900 --> 53:38.140]  You know, that's that's sad to see. Um, it's
[53:38.860 --> 53:46.620]  It's it's you know, and you see this a lot actually in the realm of movies where it's sort of accelerating from a few years ago
[53:46.620 --> 53:49.180]  you know skyfall came out and it has some
[53:50.060 --> 53:57.500]  There's some reference in there to someone being uh, you know deported to china and tortured and they put out a you know
[53:57.500 --> 54:04.940]  a chinese dub of it where one scene is cut and some of the language has changed but but otherwise the movie goes out
[54:05.260 --> 54:12.780]  But now the studios, you know, they work preemptively around what they anticipate chinese sensitivities to be
[54:12.780 --> 54:19.020]  So one of the ones I learned about is I don't know if you did you see the the doctor strange movie? Yes, I have
[54:19.740 --> 54:21.340]  Yeah
[54:21.340 --> 54:22.700]  Well, so, you know
[54:22.700 --> 54:30.460]  You know till the swittance character in that she's a that the the the the ancient one is a tibetan monk in the comic books
[54:30.780 --> 54:36.460]  And the filmmakers decided that a tibetan character would not be acceptable to china
[54:36.700 --> 54:41.500]  So they they just rewrote it and and the guy, you know, he gives some quotes somewhere and he's like well
[54:41.820 --> 54:48.240]  You know who wants to lose audience share in a big movie-going country because we decided to get political
[54:48.860 --> 54:50.860]  And you gotta ask yourself like well
[54:50.860 --> 54:54.780]  Okay, I mean, you know people don't want to make everything about politics, right?
[54:54.780 --> 54:59.740]  It's a comic book movie like fine. I get that but is having a character be tibetan
[55:00.140 --> 55:02.140]  like how political is that like
[55:02.380 --> 55:07.420]  They're just there are tibetan people, you know that chinese government doesn't like that, right?
[55:07.660 --> 55:13.100]  It's just true and you you can spin it that that comic book canon is
[55:14.060 --> 55:16.460]  all kind of loose anyway because
[55:16.460 --> 55:22.940]  You know, originally peter parker was a teenager in the 1960s, you know, so sorry and and you can do things like okay
[55:23.020 --> 55:28.060]  Aunt may was always really old like must have you know, always I just assume I don't even know the full backstory
[55:28.060 --> 55:33.260]  But I just always assumed it was this great aunt not his aunt, you know, she was clearly like grandmotherly aged
[55:34.700 --> 55:42.380]  And you can recast her as marissa tome and she's you know mid-40s or looks mid-40s at least and you know
[55:42.780 --> 55:44.460]  Not an old lady at all. That's fine
[55:44.460 --> 55:47.740]  That's fine. But did you know it that's different you're not thinking like hey
[55:47.980 --> 55:52.140]  They're just trying to avoid pissing off the people who hate old people, you know
[55:53.020 --> 55:57.900]  there's there's no there's no major market in the world where casting an
[55:58.760 --> 56:01.660]  78 year old woman in the role of aunt may is uh
[56:02.220 --> 56:07.100]  Offensive or politically dicey whereas casting, you know, having a tibetan monk might be
[56:07.740 --> 56:12.940]  And there's no people looking for it, right? I mean you can imagine people in the tibetan diaspora right who like
[56:12.940 --> 56:18.700]  Like I don't know right like no foreign army is going to come riding to their rescue, but to see
[56:19.340 --> 56:25.980]  A member of their culture represented in a prominent movie like that might that might feel nice, right?
[56:26.300 --> 56:29.580]  it might mean something to people to say like, you know, they're
[56:30.220 --> 56:36.380]  They had an impact on the world people know something about tibetan and the lamas and the monks and you know
[56:36.460 --> 56:40.380]  People do care about representation in these things and it's it's why I guess
[56:40.380 --> 56:44.860]  Marvel speculated that the chinese government would care preemptively got rid of it
[56:45.500 --> 56:52.220]  uh, but it's that's it's frightening and I think particularly technology industry companies which have gotten so
[56:53.340 --> 56:57.980]  They're so involved with how speech is transmitted nowadays, right?
[56:57.980 --> 57:03.740]  I mean whether you're talking about streaming services or original content or you know, how do we read things?
[57:03.740 --> 57:08.620]  How do we listen to things? How do we interfere? How do we interfere in elections in another country around the world?
[57:08.620 --> 57:11.980]  Right, right, right, right and you know, I mean
[57:13.260 --> 57:16.540]  I I don't know how to put this right. I mean I I I work for a
[57:17.420 --> 57:23.580]  Media company that tries to make money at you you try to make money in in your life your business
[57:23.660 --> 57:26.140]  But I do think that people in journalism
[57:27.020 --> 57:31.500]  Have always had you know a sense that like we we want to have businesses
[57:31.580 --> 57:37.340]  We like money same as everyone else but like we do want to stand for something, right?
[57:37.340 --> 57:42.780]  and there are things you wouldn't do just to go make a quick buck and I don't know that that's
[57:43.260 --> 57:48.380]  The culture of silicon valley. It's definitely not I think the culture of facebook
[57:48.860 --> 57:50.860]  Uh, but apple, you know
[57:51.420 --> 57:55.900]  Tim cook had this famous thing where he was like, I don't care about your bloody roi, right?
[57:55.980 --> 58:01.820]  He was talking about their accessibility features, right and I always took that to be a sincere thing, right?
[58:01.980 --> 58:05.980]  Going all the way back to steve jobs and like do you want to make sell sugar water?
[58:05.980 --> 58:12.060]  or do you want to change the world that not not that they're pure idealists, but that part of
[58:12.540 --> 58:15.020]  Getting people to go work there and work hard
[58:15.500 --> 58:21.580]  Is that you want to convince them that this is a company that's doing something with positive impact on the world, right?
[58:21.740 --> 58:25.740]  They're not just selling sugar water. Yeah, I thought that was an interesting moment
[58:25.740 --> 58:27.980]  That was at a shareholders meeting a couple of years back
[58:29.180 --> 58:32.220]  And I thought I and I wasn't there and I don't think they record them
[58:32.220 --> 58:38.620]  Yeah, so I only got it on transcript and by reporting but by all accounts cook got angry and and like I said, he doesn't
[58:39.260 --> 58:43.500]  His emotions don't show in public. So the fact that they did I take that as a sign of
[58:44.540 --> 58:48.300]  He he meant it so much that he actually lost his cool a bit, you know
[58:48.380 --> 58:55.420]  And for him to publicly use the word bloody, you know, it's that's not really colloquially, uh from his uh, Alabama
[58:56.140 --> 58:57.260]  roots
[58:57.260 --> 59:04.140]  Uh, I you can't help but think that he was that close as close as he's ever going to get to actually using an american curse
[59:04.220 --> 59:05.020]  word
[59:05.020 --> 59:10.620]  Sure on stage, you know, and I think he meant it. I really do think he meant it. I know and I know for a fact
[59:11.180 --> 59:13.020]  apple
[59:13.020 --> 59:17.820]  Has the best accessibility of any computing platforms and they keep making them better
[59:17.820 --> 59:22.220]  They got this voice control thing that just came out this year and it I i'm a proponent
[59:22.220 --> 59:29.100]  I've said this for years that the the thing about accessibility you have to understand is doing accessibility right actually helps
[59:29.500 --> 59:32.860]  almost all users if not all users like you don't have to be
[59:33.900 --> 59:36.220]  blind or have a serious vision impairment to
[59:36.780 --> 59:41.900]  To better use a computer where everything where there's accessibility features that help them
[59:41.900 --> 59:44.540]  you know all of a sudden you can have software that can read the screen because
[59:45.340 --> 59:46.380]  uh
[59:46.380 --> 59:49.660]  The accessibility features have to be able to read the screen etc, etc
[59:49.660 --> 59:54.460]  And you know, I won't go off on a long rant about it, but we're all we're all disabled at sometimes
[59:54.460 --> 59:59.980]  Like if you work as a bartender and it's a noisy place and your hands are full
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.060]  You know having accessibility features on your phone is a good thing
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:10.380]  You need them not because you're disabled but because you're handicapped by your environment, you know, it's right
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.220]  It's all there and I think cook meant it though, but I think apple does it and I know they don't measure it
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:21.260]  There is no the accessibility team and the time they spend putting into accessibility features is not measured in profit and loss
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.140]  And well, we made x amount of money by selling phones to people with hearing impairments. Uh,
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.700]  They don't do that. They really don't
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.700]  It's a core value, right? I mean they believe in making accessible products
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.820]  They believe that putting the time into accessibility will make them better and they also believe
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.820]  You know, I mean if you were to make a business case for it, you say look like this needs to be a company
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:49.260]  that people are excited about right and so we are going to do this the right way that
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.620]  To we want to make the best phone and being the best phone means it's a phone everyone can use, right?
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.100]  And and I think what you what you see
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.180]  Like with the flag emoji is like the lack of that
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:04.860]  Spirit, right? Even though it's a small thing
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:10.300]  But it's like you're not standing up there and saying well, we don't care about the bloody whatever it is, right?
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:17.180]  like we put flag emojis on our keyboards and we're just like we're just going to because you could always
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.940]  Once you get into a corner cutting mentality, you can always cut more corners, right?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.780]  And that's that's why he reacted that way at the shareholder meeting, right?
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:26.940]  Yeah
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.060]  You could have tried to put out a presentation defending it
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:36.400]  In economic and business terms because they wouldn't do something that didn't make sense. But part of the proposition
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.860]  Is that this is just important to them?
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:45.340]  They're going to do it all the time and they're not going to nickel and dime on each individual kind of kind of call
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:50.460]  And it looks like they are on speed and and again, it comes back to apple's profit margins
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:57.020]  It's like you can almost hear tim cook saying i'm delivering 38 profit margins to all of you every single quarter
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.620]  Every single quarter, what do you want more? It's not like we're skating by, you know on the skin of our teeth, you know
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.260]  Sure. Anyway, let me let to go back
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.900]  Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor

[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:37.820]  She co-founded clear bank with her partner andrew de suza after seeing how many companies were willing to part with precious equity in exchange
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.300]  For a bigger marketing budget clear bank believes that founders shouldn't give up a piece of their company
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:50.620]  To fund marketing and in inventory expenses clear bank makes equity free investments from ten thousand dollars

[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:06.300]  All right, that brings us back to trump and apple's showing dog and pony show, uh,
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.260]  wednesday
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:13.980]  Which the white house turned around by the end of the day in a campaign ad
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.980]  With a bombastic michael bay style score. I don't know how else to describe it
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:22.620]  I don't know. It's like a 30-second spot. Maybe it's long. I felt like
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:28.860]  10 minutes watching it. Uh, but it's you know, subtlety is not really that thing. Yeah, it's not
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:34.220]  There's a score and everything and it's you know, it was cut together to make it look as though
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:40.460]  Apple had just opened a factory everything that trump had said at the thing that wasn't true that apple had opened a factory
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.940]  thanks to donald trump and it was bringing jobs back and
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.100]  trump policy is good for apple and
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.940]  Tim cook is a trump supporter. Uh, I mean that's that's I don't think i'm exaggerating
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.260]  That's you know that what that's the message of the ad and I don't think any of those things are true
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.060]  And it's a terrible ad
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.460]  And it was entirely shot. It's not an apple-owned facility because I guess we mentioned it the
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:12.060]  It there's some company named flex that owns the that owns the the actual factory, but it's it is an apple
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:19.100]  Facility it's a facility that exists solely to make apple products and it was apple people who were in the video
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:26.240]  Number one, that's it. The whole thing is illegal because it wasn't put out by like the trump 2020
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.940]  Campaign it was put out by the white house and it is actually illegal for the white house or any other
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:39.260]  You know to to put you know, like you can't use can't say that the white house isn't supposed to be doing trump's
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:43.420]  Re-election work, but yeah, that's all they don't they don't really follow that law anymore
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.220]  But it used to be a thing. It used to be a major thing. It would have been shocking
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.980]  I mean just 10 15 years ago in the bush administration would have been shocking if a white house video
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:59.280]  Was a transparent reelection ad for george w bush. I mean it just would have been flabbergasting
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.160]  and it would have been the story of the day and and the heads would have rolled and the video would have been pulled and
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.040]  And now it's just you know
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.200]  spitting in the wind
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.760]  Yeah, but it's another thing
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.800]  uh, it's really
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.880]  To me a very low moment in apple's history. I I don't know how else to say it and I don't think i'm being
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720]  Hyperbolic when I say so
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:31.520]  And maybe yeah, you know, I I I have an open enough mind that honestly like if I could talk to tim cook
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.720]  off the record obviously and just
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.760]  You know have him pitch me on why this was worth it and maybe you know that this it's as cynical as it sounds
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080]  That the numbers were so bad
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:51.360]  If apple I had to pay these tariffs and he's fully aware of how bad this looks and nobody's nobody in this room
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:59.120]  He's fully aware of how bad this looks and nobody's nobody in the world is less happy about the way that that tour played out
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:06.000]  And i'm sure he predicted everything trump would say about it that he opened the factory and that it you know brought new jobs here
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.200]  That I knew everything he was going to say and I did it anyway
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.880]  And I would do it again because that's how important it is to apple
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:20.080]  And our customers that we'd be able to make these products without paying these tariffs. Maybe i'm willing to listen to it
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.560]  But even then that's still sad. It's i'm still sad about the state of affairs in the world, you know
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.040]  Yep
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.760]  And I can't I can't help but think that this is a little bit of it isn't quite so
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.560]  Magnanimous that it's a little bit more about greed, you know
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.480]  right
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.440]  Right. I mean, you know what what an extra tax
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.200]  It's lower margins if it goes down from 38 to 29 percent gross margins
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.320]  For a couple years until there's a new president would that would that be the end of the world and you know
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:55.120]  though you said this earlier, but the one thing you always hear from from people at apple is that the biggest
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.400]  Challenge that they have is with talent, right?
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.920]  That you know people who are good enough to work at apple are good enough to work at at lots of places
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:11.120]  They got you know, good marketable skills and in some ways apple's not like quite as cushy as some of the other tech companies
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.840]  Yeah, they don't they don't pay the most for the most. Yeah
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.120]  For whatever reason I don't I honestly don't know why
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.120]  um, but you know
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:24.640]  I do hope you know people who who work there will think about this and you know, what?
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.400]  Ability do you have to speak up, you know internally and think about your your values?
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.640]  I mean, this is an issue on not just at apple but at all the companies in the industry and if
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.440]  Having some sense of ethics is a competitive advantage in securing talent
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:48.720]  That would be a very good thing for america and for the world because it's a it's a really competitive marketplace, right?
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.880]  uh, but if people if people don't care
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.920]  What ends their work are put to you know, that's that's really bad
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.400]  You know, and this was like trump trump even said at this thing. He said oh, you know, you don't need to worry about tariffs
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.800]  Because you're building it here in america and we were saying before that's like the opposite. No, it's the opposite
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.600]  It's the opposite. What is it here? Here's the direct quote
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.520]  The nice part is he doesn't have to worry about tariffs when you build it here
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.120]  You don't have to worry about tariffs and that's not at all
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.920]  Right. That's not how the policy works
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:29.680]  Trump has all kinds of tariffs on intermediate goods and components and for some reason canadian aluminum has tariffs on it right now
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.960]  um, and it's like it's it's crazy and
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.160]  You know, you got the ceo standing right there with you and you know, you could be like, you know, mr
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.520]  President the reason I don't have to worry about tariffs is you gave us an exemption like which is great
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.040]  But it would have been even easier if we just hadn't done this, right?
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.360]  like, you know, I mean I I totally get it and tim cook is not going to
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.520]  Make a jerk out of the president. He's not gonna scream in his face. It's not going to be a setup
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.520]  He's not going to secretly have a
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840]  Cream pie and give him a pie in the face
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.040]  Uh, you know, but he could have I think he could have stood up and said something to that effect
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.920]  I think he could have you know, there are certain things he said that he could have clarified without saying
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.440]  You're wrong. Mr. President here. He could simply
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.480]  Say it the way it's actually true, you know, he could mention that we have been working
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.000]  We have been making mac pros here since 2013. He could say that
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.820]  We're talking friday afternoon about stuff that happened earlier this week and I know my colleagues at at bugs.com
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.440]  Where i'm right, uh colleagues at the verge a sister company of ours
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:42.080]  Um, and i'm sure other people around the internet, uh put inquiries in to apple's, you know, press team. We're like, hey
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.480]  What's the deal with this? Um
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.760]  And they had no response, right? They wouldn't even confirm in like a passive way like yes
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.660]  In fact, this is the same plant that we've had since 2015
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.640]  It's on apple. I mean, it's all true. So we didn't exactly need their confirmation
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:05.120]  But you know, that's a that's a middle ground that companies can take right when everyone writes the trump fact check story
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.400]  The next day apple could say on the record through a spokesperson rather than the ceo
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.800]  If they don't want to put tim cook in it be like, yeah, that was that was wrong
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.640]  But they didn't they were like no comment and I I will confirm that I myself contacted apple pr
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.980]  In addition to having asked if I could get a media pass. I actually asked afterwards
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:32.100]  Uh, hey my expectation is that this is the same plant where the previous generation mac pro has been made since 2013
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.980]  Can you and it's just a new assembly line at the same plant. Can you confirm that and I got no response?
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:44.260]  Right, and that's I mean like that's weird, right? I mean look companies companies sometimes don't respond to inquiries, but like your job
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:51.940]  In public relations is to provide accurate information to the media about what is happening when people ask them
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:56.340]  Normally if you'd come in if this had been two weeks ago, and you'd been like hey
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:03.620]  When did you guys open that plant in texas or hey, is this new campus? Is that where they're making the mac pros?
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.580]  They would have been like no, it's like a couple hours away
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.540]  But you know, we are proud to work in the united states
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.300]  You know, they give you some pitch, but they wouldn't be like, oh, I don't even know
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.940]  When do we build our buildings? Right? I mean they know
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:22.980]  And apple, you know famously it does tend to issue no comment on almost anything and and faint, you know, it's
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:28.420]  It's yeah, you know, bloomberg will come out with a report that there's a rumor that about the 2020 phone
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.060]  And then as part of their standard reporting process
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.220]  They will call or text or whatever and see if apple will comment and apple
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.500]  spokesperson will always decline to comment that they don't comment on rumors and speculation and I have
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.260]  I can't think of this thing off the top of my head, but often when I
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.500]  Do need or want clarification from apple it is on something
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:55.800]  Sensitive, you know and and there have been times over the years where i've gotten no response at all to certain questions
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.080]  But I understand it because i'm asking about
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.120]  Um, you know like the implications of a security bug or or something like that
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.160]  Yeah, I don't know, you know
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.600]  But where you can imagine where they would rather say nothing because they don't want to say anything
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.880]  And be wrong about it. Maybe they don't know right?
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.240]  How long has this plant been open in texas is not one of those questions
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:21.080]  this is it this is the the parallel between their their
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.920]  They're dancing with china and dancing with trump
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.880]  Is that things that shouldn't be?
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:33.720]  controversial like having a tibetan monk as a character in a superhero movie, uh or
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.420]  Just clarifying it. Yes. This is the same goddamn plant that's been open since 2013
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.840]  Here we are and it's controversial. It's right, you know and you
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.480]  You're right. It's it's very, you know, because i'm
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:54.040]  You know, I i'm not like a like a gadgets, uh, you know guy I I don't review products
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.440]  so i've never like tried to ask them like
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.440]  You know, what's what what are you going to do about about your next phone?
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.400]  And then and then they tell you no, uh, but you know what i've had to ask them about like tax stuff, you know
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:11.240]  Like any company like they've got their line. They've got their spin. But like if you want to know like
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.640]  Like what's the deal with blah blah blah, you know stuff that's in their records?
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.160]  And I just don't happen to know how to dig it up, but they just say it, you know, like it's fine
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:27.160]  It's company it's reporting and it's it's truly odd to go into full no comment mode
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:34.600]  Not to avoid some embarrassment to the company but to avoid an embarrassment to the president of the united states
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.480]  Yes, like that's weird. You don't you don't see companies do that
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:43.560]  Normally any industry right? It's because they didn't do anything wrong
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.760]  Right, and it's hard again
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.840]  It's I shouldn't even have to say this but it's this is the nature of trump being trump and it is not a left-right
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.920]  Divide it's not conservative liberal. I've been writing daring fireballs since
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.840]  2002
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:05.720]  so, you know, I I went through most of the whole bush administration and then all of the obama administration and it
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.280]  Just never would have come up as different
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.540]  different
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:12.440]  politically as bush and obama were
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.320]  Uh, it just never would have occurred to me that there'd be a moment where apple this apple stuff that I write about would involve
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.400]  the company avoiding comment to avoid embarrassing the president it just now I
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.760]  I couldn't have even imagined this scenario
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:33.080]  Yet here we are. I mean it shows how trump also inserts himself into every walk of life in a
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:39.240]  Aggravating way. I mean I I have been listening to the show for years, uh reading daring fireball for a long time
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.040]  i'm, really excited, uh to be on here, but it's also
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.120]  Strange, you know that um, we have gotten into a point where there is so much
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.800]  uh
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:55.800]  Politic politicking around apple wants to make a new high-end desktop computer
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.080]  Right, like that should be a pretty niche
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.660]  technology story that you know frankly like even most people who care a lot about computers don't
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.300]  Don't need this mac pro in their lives much less donald trump like meddling with with everything
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:19.340]  It's like it's depressing. I I like I like to listen to a show like this for a respite. Uh, yes, and I I almost feel that
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:26.940]  Into people's earphones feel like oh god more trems, but you know, no, yeah, and there's no way to avoid it this week
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.740]  Sorry, I mean i'm not even apologizing for the political nature of it
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.020]  I mean, it's a couple people pointed out on twitter like because they know
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:38.540]  my feelings on trump, but they're like has there ever been a cycle a news cycle that's more in the uh,
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.980]  center of the venn diagram of my interests and it's like
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.020]  Unfortunately, no, like you'd like to think that it's a story where it's like this is a story
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:53.020]  I love to write about and talk about because it's right in the middle. It's like the john gruber bullseye. This is great
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:58.220]  And unfortunately, there's you know, there's a flip side to the bullseye. There's this you have to write about this
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:03.020]  Because it's in the dead center of venn diagram of your interests, uh, but not in a good way
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.940]  Anyway, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor. Oh long time friends of the show squarespace
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:12.300]  Look squarespace is the all in one place
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.700]  To make your website everything from getting your domain name
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:22.860]  The design the templates the tweaking of the templates the posting updates like if you have a blog or something like that
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.940]  You do it all through squarespace
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.820]  I keep telling you guys when you uh
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.940]  When you listen to me talk about squarespace that you've you see squarespace sites every day and you don't even know it
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:39.100]  Because they don't have like a telltale look or a subset of templates and it's like, oh, that's clearly a squarespace site
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.780]  They're as unique as your brand is
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:50.620]  Is your website will reflect that I was just talking to some designers today. We're getting some stuff designed in the house
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:57.020]  Their company website guess what hosted by squarespace somehow it came up that I was going to do a podcast later today
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.500]  I don't know how it came up and we're talking about you know as an example of who sponsors the show
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500]  I didn't even know squarespace was sponsoring the show today
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:08.140]  But it seemed like a good guess and they said hey we make our website with squarespace and I asked them
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.940]  Well, let me tell you if you want to help me out. How's it go? How do you like it?
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.300]  They lost their web designer a couple months ago. Um
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.660]  It just you know, not lost like they hired them, but they you know
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:21.660]  They did busy and moved on and I think he moved across the country or something
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:28.940]  They keep updating the site themselves totally non-web designer people. They keep updating the site themselves. Absolutely. No problem
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.020]  You do not need to be a technical expert
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:35.180]  To use you don't need to be a technical expert in any way to use squarespace
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:36.940]  um
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.420]  So my thanks to them next time you need a website somebody, you know needs a website

[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.580]  And my guess is you won't even look to your second choice

[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.940]  At squarespace.com slash talk show and the offer code same as the url slug talk show
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:13.500]  Here's the thing. I thought of in my notes. I don't take extensive notes before the show as you might guess
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.620]  But it occurred to me
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:21.740]  Thinking about it. I as an apple observer. I have remained
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.780]  Over the last I guess it's eight years now
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.620]  Studiously
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:32.780]  Cautious and conservative about playing the
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:39.260]  This wouldn't have happened or would have happened differently if steve jobs if steve jobs were still around
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.220]  Because I don't think it's useful I think most of the
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:49.660]  Speculation along those lines was proven terribly wrong over the last few years, you know
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:55.020]  I mean, you know the gist of it was like circa 2013 apples going under because steve jobs is gone
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:59.660]  And they'll never make another new product and we'll soon forget about them. And that's obviously not true
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:06.540]  But it is very difficult for me to imagine steve jobs appearing alongside trump
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.420]  at that
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.340]  At that a thing on I don't even want to call it on wednesday
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.140]  like yeah
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.300]  I don't know
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:23.900]  What would have happened in the alternate world where steve jobs was still a ceo?
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.900]  And alive and healthy
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:31.740]  Uh and trump were president and this tariffs thing was going on. I can imagine jobs being cynical enough to
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:38.940]  To go along to some degree to get the tariffs right like that doesn't sound out, you know to get the
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:43.020]  Exemptions to the tariffs that doesn't sound out of character to me
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:48.940]  Um, if anything that seems like something he'd perhaps be more willing to do than tim cook. I could be wrong
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:55.260]  I could be completely wrong. I cannot imagine him standing there and doing it and putting on a suit and tie
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:00.380]  uh, I don't think he would have I don't think he would have participated in the
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:06.940]  Executive council whatever they called it technical council thing that trump. Yeah
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:11.980]  Uh, I mean remember and just think about how fast things have changed remember who was on the other side of
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.580]  Him at the time like on trump's left was tim cook and on his right was jeff bezos really hard to imagine
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.860]  jeff bezos appearing with trump today
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:25.420]  Given trump's relationship, you know stance on the washington post. Um
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:32.060]  Who knows maybe if in the world where steve jobs were still around and tim cook was still the coo
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:35.900]  It still would have been tim cook showing up in the way that
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:43.260]  Steve jobs even while ceo very rarely appeared on those quarterly analyst calls
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:50.620]  It was tim cook who handled it as you know his coo lieutenant because it just wasn't steve jobs's bag to talk
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.620]  The talk that analysts want to hear
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:22:00.780]  so maybe it would have been but that gets to your point about trump being so sensitive to perceived slights and how things play like
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.740]  I you know
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.700]  It seems you know jobs was
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:13.420]  Jobs was not the type to be as cagey as tim cook, right? I mean
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:17.260]  The like doing it but not saying anything
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:24.300]  And not not saying anything either way, right not not defending himself against his critics either right?
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.780]  I mean jobs. I mean a typical sort of founder
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:32.540]  Do you know a difference between a founder and an executive right? It's like steve jobs
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.340]  He he had a lot
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.340]  A lot to say, you know
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.340]  A lot of ego right like on display not just like a quiet, you know
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:49.740]  Doing the business kind of thing and it's it's it's hard to imagine him being sort of half in public view in this way
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:54.860]  Right there on camera, but not saying or doing anything, right if he was going to show up
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.580]  It would it would be to do something
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.220]  And it's hard to it's just hard to imagine it and again even the politics of it aside
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:06.780]  I just can't can't imagine that he could abide the nonsense, you know
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:11.100]  Like whether you've you know left or right on who you hope wins the next presidential election
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.980]  Although we know from his you know his we we know that steve jobs leaned left and and was you know
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:23.580]  Close advise, you know al gore is on the board of directors at apple for god's sake there and they're apparently he's apparently one
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.620]  Was one of the closest members of the board to steve jobs
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:34.940]  To steve jobs, um, I just can't it's just the optics of it. I just can't see it and letting trump blather on and
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:41.260]  You know, uh attract all the attention of the moment like, you know, tim cook is obviously willing to be
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:44.300]  The quiet person, you know, right what was the phrase?
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.420]  He he stood by silently
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:53.100]  Yeah, I mean could you jobs would not be the the second banana in any no relationship, right?
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:59.020]  Whereas that's that's how tim cook got to be tim cook right standing behind steve jobs a lot tim
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.980]  or steve jobs clearly had a it was a
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:09.500]  I don't know if I often get confused about the this seems like something that I should understand but I get I get confused by the
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.060]  difference between strategy and tactics
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:19.740]  But it was I think it was both a strategy and a tactic but steve jobs had a thing where if he came into a room
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.100]  He immediately asserted himself as steve fucking jobs
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:29.580]  And there's a famous story of the segue and I forget what it was called. I had a code name at the time
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:36.780]  But uh the guy who invented the segue had invited a whole bunch of big shots to to see it before it was publicly unveiled
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:39.980]  And it was you know, jeff bezos was there and I forget who else was there
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:43.900]  But steve jobs was one of the people who was there and steve job just comes in the room took a look at it
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.260]  and said this is garbage and had like three things right off the bat like
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:52.860]  Uh, there's another story, you know, this that's a room full of people, right and he just wanted to assert that he was steve
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.700]  But you know if you read the story about i'll try i'll try to remember to put it in the show notes his
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:02.540]  Criticism of it was actually spot on and his like your idea that people are going to ride around cities in this things
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:07.500]  You're you're you're an idiot. That's never going to happen because of x y and z and of course we live in a world today where
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:13.500]  Electronic scooters and things have become a much bigger turn so there was he was onto something but the segue itself
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:18.380]  Never really took off in that way. I think that all of them are in use in malls shopping malls and epcot center
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.180]  You know, I think everyone riding one is a uh, although I guess here in philly
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.260]  They do have tour groups that take them, but I don't see them very often anymore that that seemed to be
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:34.940]  They don't in dc down down by the national mall segue tours. But yeah, it's a it's a niche it never it never changed the world
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:39.740]  Yeah, well, he does he's a very smart guy about products. Yeah. The other story I remember was uh,
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:43.260]  Well, I did a whole bunch of them, but one time he met an executive from espn
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:49.260]  Or disney or something like that. Uh, it might have been like after the pics, you know sale of pixar to disney
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:54.460]  Uh, and he met a guy from espn and espn had just come out. It was you know, this is before the iphone
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.460]  This is like 2005 or six or something
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:02.700]  When things like what i'm about to say were totally normal espn had come out with a phone
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:10.300]  It was like an espn phone where you could if you got the espn phone you'd get like text messages with scores or something like that
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.300]  You know and it came free with the phone
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:17.820]  And the guy was like, oh, I can't wait to meet steve jobs and he's like, hey i'm so and so from espn
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.780]  And jobs just says your phone fucking sucks
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:27.420]  That's just like what he said. It's like how he introduces himself to the guy. He's not like hey nice to meet you by the way
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.180]  Let me tell you something
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:34.060]  He's not like hey nice to meet you by the way, let me tell you something that phone you guys mean kind of stinks
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:37.740]  He just goes your phone fucking sucks. It's like he just asserts dominance, right?
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.060]  It's hard to imagine him being in a room with trump where they're both
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:48.540]  You know, it just seems like it would enter an infinite loop of trying to you know assert dominance over each other
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.020]  Yeah
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:56.620]  Uh, I had I had this one. I had this observation. So tim cook. I think another adjective that you would describe
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:27:01.840]  Tim cook as is diplomatic and I think the way he handled this thing wednesday was very diplomatic
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.620]  his decision to remain silent in the face of
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.340]  false hoods about the
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:09.740]  factory and trump's, uh
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:13.580]  Bizarre rant at the end not bizarre if you follow trump
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:20.060]  But bizarre for the occasion rant about the phony fake news that we don't have it. We don't have a free press in the united states
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.620]  uh
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.620]  You know just nonsense it's
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:31.920]  It's he would you know diplomatically chose to remain silent. Nobody would really describe steve jobs as diplomatic
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.020]  I think he could be if he had a goal in mind
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:41.900]  Uh, and the other thing just an interesting just a flipping of the world, you know, uh cats chasing dogs
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:47.260]  Uh is that I would say of every previous president of the united states
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.900]  It was diplomatic because that's like a key skill
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.900]  both toward
[01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:58.620]  Getting elected and being president which are two different things very different things
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:01.660]  but in both cases
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:08.380]  Common sense diplomacy is part of the job and trump has just completely blown that up
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.540]  so now now we've got a ceo of apple who's
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.820]  a genuinely talented diplomat and a president
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.340]  so lacking in diplomacy diplomatic normal skills as to
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:21.340]  Bugger belief, right?
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.340]  Yeah, I mean it's
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:25.980]  It's it's completely
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.780]  You you can see how it it puts certain kinds of people in a odd
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:37.180]  Position right? I mean because you do have to deal with him. I mean any ceo of a big company
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:44.460]  Needs to needs to navigate in a world where the president of the united states, you know exists and and his opinions
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:51.900]  Makes sense and and normally normally you wouldn't normally you wouldn't have a president push the envelope like that
[01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:56.140]  You wouldn't put the ceo of a company in that kind of spot, right?
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:01.580]  But it is like it's it's a little bit I think of a dominance game for trump, right? Yes hook
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:04.140]  Cook back down, you know, he
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.900]  Nobody is actually fooled by this right at the end of the day
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:12.060]  Because there's a lot of reporting we we do have a free party
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.340]  there's a lot of reporting we we do have a free press but
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.860]  trump showed that in a kind of
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:23.340]  stupid pointless game of chicken tim cook was not
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.500]  Was was was willing to back down, you know, he wasn't going to say
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:28.940]  No, you're wrong. Mr
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:34.860]  President right and like you could imagine like would trump really like go to town with him on on tariffs over that?
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.620]  I don't know and and you know, it's it's good that jeff bezos has not
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:43.420]  You know curtailed the washington post in response to any number of
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:50.460]  Vituperative tweets from trump and even suggestions that he'll go after amazon on on policy grounds. Um
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:57.420]  You know, it's really important for the the world that you know, people have some kind of backbone because at the end of the day
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.460]  I mean
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:04.780]  They are vulnerable to pressure. But also these are you know, the most privileged and secure people in in the universe
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.980]  Um, and if they can't put themselves out there a little bit for
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.940]  Like basic truth, you know, it's not great
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.380]  trump, so can't imagine
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.260]  He's so convinced that bezos, I mean by all a point, you know
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.760]  You'd know it better than me being both a in the media and being in washington
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.220]  uh that
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.220]  uh by all accounts
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:32.620]  Bezos leadership or ownership I should say he doesn't really lead
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:39.980]  He's the owner of the washington post has truly it's truly hands-off editorially that there are no accounts at all of any kind of hey
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:45.900]  Let's take it easy on the stories about amazon and taxes, you know, let's take it easy on that. Nothing
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.500]  Nothing not and and if he tried it, there's no way
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:51.180]  that
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:55.660]  Anybody at the post would stand for it. I mean they would it would be out and it would be in the new york
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:01.820]  Times five minutes later, you know, it's hard to stop journalists from leaking. They right. They know a lot of other people at the right
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.420]  press, right, um
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:06.540]  And well and also even even if you thought right it's like well, okay
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.060]  Look, you should not rely on the washington post as your only source of information about the company amazon.com
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:13.660]  That's common sense
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:20.700]  but like the idea that jeff bezos is like directing their coverage of the trump administration right because of some
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:25.820]  cockamamie thing related to postal service rates like that's insane it is and
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:33.260]  But trump clearly can't imagine that if he owned the washington post not abusing his ownership
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:39.260]  To further his own agenda and punish his enemies real or perceived
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:44.300]  He so can't imagine not doing it that he just assumes bezos must be doing it
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:51.900]  And so therefore it must be driven by jeff bezos because what kind of what kind of a billionaire wouldn't wouldn't use his newspaper that way
[01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:58.380]  Right. I mean the idea that one thing you might do as a billionaire is actually just enjoy the ability to
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:04.220]  Be a little loose with your money and have people say nice things about you because you're the patron of a great newspaper
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:08.140]  It's like beyond his comprehension, right? Absolutely
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.660]  It's a sad world
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:16.380]  Uh, so now we've got a diplomatic CEO like I did just in the what-if scenarios
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.940]  It's like I just imagine going back to like the you know
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:22.620]  15 years ago, you know, uh 2004 and talking to
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:28.220]  Younger john gruber and saying I come from the future in 2019
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:33.180]  and the president of the united states and apple's ceo
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.580]  held a
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:40.540]  Joint press availability and one of them went off on a bizarre rant
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.980]  I would think oh my god. What did jobs do? What did jobs? Oh my god
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:51.420]  What what in the world did jobs did steve jobs say or or get hell-bent about?
[01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:56.620]  I never would have occurred to me in a million years that it would be the other way around and it would be the president
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.820]  Of the united states who went off on an impetuous rant
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.340]  Yep
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.500]  Oh I did did I mention that the new smart battery case has a dedicated camera button
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.740]  Oh
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.140]  Oh, there we go, this is this is the smart button
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.340]  Review episode that's that's what this one was about
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:24.860]  Oh to spend an entire podcast episode talking about this button. Uh, I have one
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:32.380]  I have a fourth and final sponsor to thank before we wrap up with the final segment. It's our friends at express vpn
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.620]  express vpn
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.620]  Is an easy to use so easy
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:44.860]  You put it on your iphone tap one button and all of a sudden your iphone is connected to a vpn protecting all of your network
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.060]  Traffic
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:51.180]  It couldn't be easier. You don't have to be an expert at all
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.660]  You don't really have to understand how vpns work
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.380]  But the basic idea is it's a virtual private network where everything?
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.500]  Into and out of your phone goes through the vpn. It's all encrypted
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:08.060]  But that means even when you go to a website that is not itself encrypted
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:14.860]  Your traffic is encrypted because it's all over the vpn so you could do things like use hotel wi-fi or coffee shop wi-fi
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.180]  Uh or the the goofy wi-fi on an airplane or something like that
[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:24.540]  uh and realize that all of your traffic is as secure as could be
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.140]  If you've ever used wi-fi at a hotel or shopping mall, you know what i'm talking about
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.420]  You're sending your data over an open network. There's no encryption at all
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:34.860]  Um express vpn is an award-winning app. It was
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:43.900]  Rated highly by sites like tech radar and cnet recommended as the number one vpn provider by tech radar in particular
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:48.620]  And they are a company that takes privacy and security very seriously
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.860]  It's what they're all about and they take it to the next level
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:57.180]  They've even invented a technology called trusted server to ensure that vpn servers run from ram
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:03.500]  With no data logs that are written to the server's hard drive even by accident tire thing runs in ram. Nothing's written to disk
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.300]  Really? It's a technology they invented
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:12.320]  If you want the best in online security and privacy protection head over to expressvpn.com

[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.940]  Have you seen the new tesla cyber truck yes, it looks uh
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:42.140]  It looks like a like like a rendering from old uh, like starfox yeah
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.860]  Super nintendo game. Um
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:49.600]  I don't know as soon as I saw it. It looked to me like a rough draft of a delorean
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:55.120]  And then I found out I actually found it. It is in fact made with stainless steel and that gives it some of that look
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.880]  But it has that wedge shape. I will say this. I don't love the design of it
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.240]  I really don't I don't hate it as much as some people seem to
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:09.040]  But I love that it's original and looks like nothing else. Like I think one of my knocks against tesla
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:17.040]  Is that I don't think they've done anything truly innovative in the exterior design of cars like
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.680]  I know a tesla model s when I see it
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:25.680]  But for the most part they just sort of look a lot like all the other sedans of the same size class
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:29.680]  And there's certain things that they do that. I think they're starting to look old-fashioned. I think
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.080]  Putting chrome around the window trim of the car. I i've never liked chrome on a on a car like that
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.240]  There's a lot of stuff that they've done over the years that just isn't that great and then when they do something original like put the
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.120]  The gull wings on their suv crossover thing. It's just stupid. Nobody wants that
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.120]  Uh, at least this cyber truck, which is the most ridiculous name too, which I kind of love
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.720]  I mean who uses cyber anymore except joe biden. That is the main thing cyber cyber truck. We're gonna
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:05.840]  The only other person the information superhighway the only other person I know who still uses word cyber is joe biden
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:12.160]  I mean, well, yeah, but look as somebody who is not at all in the market for a truck
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.760]  I'm excited to see uh, something weird-looking. Yeah road, you know, I I love it. It's a more entertaining universe
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  Yeah, I totally love it. Uh,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.880]  So apparently the demo went poorly where they were showing how incredibly he it
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.440]  You know elon is is obviously a little bit of an exaggerator in there, you know, he's a showman
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:37.760]  Sledgehammer against the door no damage and that the the glass he wanted to say it's bulletproof and then he caught himself and said almost
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.720]  Bulletproof, you know, which is because bulletproof has a very specific meaning it literally means
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.600]  But then they this seems bulletproof seems like a in that horseshoes and hand grenades category
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.400]  Yeah, the bullet goes through your window and you don't want to be like well bullet almost didn't make it
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.480]  Yeah, almost bulletproof
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.480]  So I think that's a really good point
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:03.280]  Yeah, almost bulletproof is you know, like almost pregnant, uh, but then they tossed like a steel marble onto the window
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:07.520]  I guess it was supposed to show that it won't crack and instead it shattered right in the demo
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:15.760]  He had great stage presence though. He he worked through it. Yeah, you know, it's uh, he's he's truly the greatest showman
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.240]  Current current tech leaders. Yeah, um
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.120]  But I also think that the show is going to be a little bit different than the show
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:30.720]  But I also feel like he keeps promising things that don't actually like happen. Yeah
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:37.600]  Totally like when were you supposed to like have a mars colony soon? Yeah, but maybe his optimism on that front
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.640]  Like i'm not a huge elon musk supporter, but i'm glad he's there. I am glad he's there
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.160]  I know some people, you know
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:44.480]  certainly
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.600]  I know there's there's people who listen to the show who are bigger fans of him than me
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:53.520]  I know that there's a subset of people who think that everything that ails apple is that they should somehow buy tesla
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.480]  So that he can be the ceo of the joint company, you know
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.040]  Like the way that they got steve jobs when they bought next and it is interesting, you know
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.240]  I bring this up because it is an interesting car and it just came out yesterday
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.960]  Um, but it fits with this description of tim cook being very cautious and of sort of
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.800]  Very different person than steve jobs. Whereas elon musk is the closest thing we have to a steve jobs like character
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.480]  You know no one and I can see why long time apple
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.280]  Fans would have the view that it would be better to somehow
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:34.000]  Make that merger happen. Like I I don't think it's true. It's like apple is a mature company now and it benefits from having
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.600]  Notwithstanding everything we've been saying about tim cook and trump it is appropriate for it to have a mature
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:46.080]  Ceo who runs a very complicated very large-scale business that needs to be
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.400]  That needs to be organized and disciplined and not promising things that
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:55.360]  come two days late or smashing windows on stage, but it was
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:02.960]  Exciting right apple was in some ways more it was more fun in some ways to be an apple fan when it was a
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  A little underdog company that had this headstrong ceo and was doing crazy stuff, right?
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.200]  Like we're gonna have blue computers. Whoa, right and now it's like
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.200]  you know
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:19.840]  I think the boring thing gets overstated sometimes but it's very competent and it's very mature
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.120]  We know there's going to be a new phone every year, right? So i'm not like holy shit. They've made a new phone
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.200]  Yeah, it's obvious
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.760]  Yeah, my favorite exam well now maybe not the best example
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.920]  But I know one example of that was iMessage where they were unveiling iMessage for the first time
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.720]  I forget what year it was but you know early on in the phone
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.600]  And apparently what happened is during the keynote rehearsals
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.640]  Jobs hit upon the idea. Well, let's open source this thing and yeah, so then you just said it
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.400]  Yeah, and people are like, well, we'll look into it
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.360]  I don't know if we can I don't know if we can do that and then he just said it
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.080]  He'd said it on stage that we're opening the whole thing
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:56.960]  It's you know
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.240]  We're sending it to the standard bodies and whatever and I know for a fact that people who worked on the iMessage team
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.800]  That was the first they heard about it and they were like, yeah
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.520]  And they're like we can't do that and they're thinking about the parts of the code that you know
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.720]  That you know, like can't be licensed can't be you know, literally not just legally couldn't be open source that there were patent protected things
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.480]  and they were like, uh
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.760]  What are we gonna do?
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:23.680]  And you know, it never happened. Right? Yeah, it never happened never happened. Yeah
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.080]  Yeah, that's not gonna happen with tim cook, right?
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:32.500]  That is never going to happen with tim cook where he's going to impetuously decide to open source a major technology
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.240]  You know 48 hours before a keynote and not tell the team or double check that it's even possible
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.840]  That this is not gonna happen and they and they hit their deadlines, right?
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.160]  I mean, that's like the you know, he's the logistics guy. He runs the company. It's big
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.120]  We don't have this like when is there going to be a new mac os?
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:55.120]  So we had what they had to delay it because they needed engineers to do the phone right at one point
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.960]  you know, and that's
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.960]  but it was from a
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.480]  Coverage perspective more more entertaining and tesla is a very fun company, right?
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.960]  Yeah, it's a really weird thing. They just like totally screwed up
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:15.280]  Product demonstration which is way more entertaining than having it go. Well, right, so right, you know good for them
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:15.760]  well
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:22.080]  and and apple used to have demos fail much more regularly in the steve jobs era because I think they were more aggressive about
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:27.120]  Them and I was just talking to I think joanna stern about it recently
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:30.560]  I think it was joanna when she was on and it was before her time
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:32.800]  in the
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.080]  apple media crowd, but there was this this demo
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.400]  Of an iphone where the wi-fi went out on stage and jobs
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:48.080]  Just didn't work and jobs came back and was like asking the media like he's like, you know why I my my people told me
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.320]  Why it's because there's 587 hot spots in this room right now. Shut them all down
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.640]  If you're out there and you see someone with it shut it down and it's like way off script, right?
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.680]  And it was kind of right scary to see angry steve jobs talking to and it was a wwdc
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.920]  So I think there was like four or five thousand people in the room
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.160]  It's like shut it down shut them all down
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.840]  And I meanwhile i'm in the press area and everybody still has the keyboards open
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.920]  Everybody's no nobody. No, I don't think one person did the media close their laptop because they're all you know
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.560]  Either taking notes or live vlogging. It just didn't happen. But you know now yeah
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.040]  It's been a long time since they've had a demo fail. I think the riskiest one that they've done in recent years
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:30.640]  Uh was the when they introduced the cellular apple watch. Do you remember this one?
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.640]  And they had the woman out
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:39.280]  Standing in it on a canoe in the middle of a lake with an ad like a super telephoto lens to to get her on camera
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:45.760]  And she took a call from jeff williams live during the keynote on her apple watch while she was in the middle of a lake
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.200]  Uh, but you gotta bet she'd been out on that lake like for a month
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:57.360]  Just calls every day. Yeah, she's she's living in the middle of the lake. Yeah people right? I mean, you know, it's very uh,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:04.640]  Very efficient. It just seemed like in addition to the possible possibility of a technology failure that there was the possibility of a balance failure
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.160]  And she falls into the lake, you know, it was bad weather. Yeah bad weather
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:12.640]  You can't be out there if there's lightning, you know, it's there was there wasn't but you we never know
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.960]  Like what was what was plan f uh, you know, maybe there was a dozen people on different lakes throughout america
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840]  scale, uh
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:28.160]  What about this vape app ban, did you see me right about that? Oh, yeah the vape so this is right so there
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:34.480]  This is I can tell i've become old because I didn't even know there were vape apps. No me neither
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:42.880]  This is like, oh, yeah, i'm totally I I always use my phone to to vape. Um, you know, this is like
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.920]  I think that like the app store the centralized control like I I believe
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.960]  What apple says mostly that like this is good. It's good for consumers. It's easier for everybody
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:02.240]  But then you get into these things like I hear such conflicting stuff about vaping, you know from different public health stakeholders
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.200]  American lung association seems to have one view
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:11.680]  But a lot of you know people people like count to another because it's it's just complicated calculus, right? Like does it?
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:17.600]  Displace harm by getting people to not smoke, you know traditional cigarettes
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:24.800]  Small, you know traditional cigarettes or does it get new generations of young people on it's like a really hard problem
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.720]  and not
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:27.760]  like
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:33.280]  Within apple's zone of expertise, right? Right. This is not what they do as a
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:39.200]  Institution but they're deciding and it's it's weird. I totally get the argument again
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.680]  I've tried to emphasize in my take on it that I feel like it's a very close call and it's I if you want me
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:51.920]  To always have a hundred percent black or a hundred percent white. Yes or no take on every single thing
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.280]  I am not the pundit to read or listen to
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:00.800]  I feel like this one is like a sports instant replay where it's like damn
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.560]  I don't know if he's in inbounds or out of bounds that is close and like
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.160]  Whichever way they come up with you kind of even if it was against what you wanted or what you squinted the tv and see
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:13.600]  I I just feel like you have to admit this is kind of a close call
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:19.040]  because it's so all over the map, you know that there's a reasonable source saying it's
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:26.720]  Way safer than smoking and then there's other reasonable sources saying that this is incredibly dangerous and unknown and that these
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.520]  mysterious 42 deaths are so
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.920]  mysterious that
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.560]  You know, we really don't even understand why these people are dead and that's terrible terrifying
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.000]  Isn't this actually what you would you want to have a government for right? Yes
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.400]  companies normally don't want to be regulated
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.320]  But in this case, I would think you would want to say to congress or the fda or something
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.760]  Be like look like a lot of people are yelling at me from both sides about this and like we don't care
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.640]  Right, like we we have no financial stake in this we legitimately just want to do the right thing
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.960]  But we want someone else to tell us
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.600]  But what that is, right? Yeah, this is
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:10.080]  We have an fda actually for for a reason right? Um, and they should make a decision
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.080]  They should make a decision
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.120]  Yeah, and it's like I get I get the argument that you know
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:20.720]  One political party is a little bit more pro-business and therefore a little wants in general wants
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:24.800]  Regulations eased and wants to minimize the number of them
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.480]  uh
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:30.000]  And that the other side maybe is a little more public policy
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:36.000]  Focused and is a little bit more prone to more and tighter regulations. I get that argument
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.160]  That's what the political process is supposed to
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.960]  Iron out and and you should you know in the long run
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.560]  Achieve a balance because if one side goes too far the other the public opinion should shift in the other party's favor
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:50.720]  That's the way it's supposed to work and but the fda in particular
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:58.560]  uh like along with the uh, like the national highway standards and stuff like that like making sure that you're
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:05.520]  Legally ensuring that you have the highest possible chance known to man of surviving a car accident
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:12.000]  Should not be a political issue that it's like a triumph of engineering the way that you know the accidents that people can survive today
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:13.760]  compared to
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.200]  Decades past and you know being able to buy
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.240]  meat and know that it's
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:28.160]  There's a very high likelihood that it's not infected with e.coli because it's inspected by federal regulators whose only interest is in certifying
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.520]  That yes, indeed this fruit and produce and meat is you know free of of contaminants
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.520]  Yeah, that's a good thing
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.600]  Right. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't know. I mean, it's just this is not
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.560]  You ever say like this is just not like apple's
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:50.180]  Wheelhouse right like correctly, you know, so I don't know it's it's a weird one and it's bizarrely
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:58.480]  Also a trump issue because weeks ago trump had latched on this and apparently at the behest of his wife and daughter
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.800]  had come out as in
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:07.440]  had come out as in as wanting to ban and I believe it was it is within the scope of the
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:10.080]  executive office's powers to issue
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:18.960]  The fda has this regulatory authority over tobacco and right it's a 2009 law so they could have banned it trump
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.960]  Said he was going to
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:28.420]  I guess because of milania's engagement with right, you know baron and his peers and then there was this intense
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:30.020]  This
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:36.660]  Frankly idiotic lobbying pushback which showed him like polling that like all these single issue vape voters
[01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:38.980]  Right supposedly out there and we're going to turn against him
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:44.500]  But like it's a I don't know. This is a technical issue. He has a reasonable fda
[01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:50.420]  chair, um that you some parts of the government are still being run by professionals and
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:54.500]  honestly, this is like you need to ask the
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:50:00.920]  Scientists and the public health people to take a take a look at it and trump's initial idea
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.520]  That the that the flavored ones, you know, really target a new market of teens
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:12.760]  I mean that sounded reasonable to me it does to me again. It's not it's not my like area but
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:20.760]  This really is what we have regulatory agencies for. Um, and this seemed strange for me for apple to jump the gun this way
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.920]  right, even though
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.920]  Taking the apps off like it's it's a reasonable
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.880]  idea, but also
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  It seemed it seemed odd to me that
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:37.160]  Nobody was quite pushing for it and it seems like the deaths are maybe related to like unreliable use
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:40.760]  Of the mechanisms and black market stuff. So it might be kind of productive and
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:46.120]  It's just like it's a hard question and I I don't know why they exactly felt they had to like dive into it
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:51.320]  Yeah, and it's far more controversial. We're not talking about where you and I aren't talking about vape
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.160]  At all, let alone apple's relation to it if apple hadn't done this, right?
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.920]  It just wasn't even on my radar
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.920]  like you said I honestly I didn't even know there were such things as vape apps and then
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.160]  you know
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:09.640]  Him like while I was writing my take on it. I didn't perceive that they were facing like a tidal wave of criticism. No
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.080]  No
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:13.720]  Although who knows? I mean, maybe they have I don't know parents in the
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:20.760]  Company who who care that my my kid's four. So fortunately he's not he's under the vaping demo quite yet
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:25.560]  Yeah, uh mine is 15 going on 16. So he's right there. I think my wife has said to him
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.360]  Like a thousand times if I ever catch you vaping you're dead
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.600]  Yeah, well we need we need his take he's he's the
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.960]  relevant expert no, but there was like a thing in the newsletter from the parents last year there was a scan, you know
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:45.480]  a couple of kids got caught vaping in the bathroom and it's a whole big thing and oh, there you go
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.800]  There you go. And so of course they are, you know
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.680]  It the numbers are crazy. Don't do it kids
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:52.840]  Well, the numbers are crazy
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.960]  I looked at these pew research numbers on their polling and you know again pew is pretty reputable and does you know
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.480]  Regarded as a good pollster that uh 2016
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:08.200]  It was like 13 of 12th graders in the us had reported vaping in the last 30 days and in 2018
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:13.720]  It was 27 percent. So going from 13 to 27 percent in two years is rather stunning
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.920]  I mean, that's that's it. And I think that's part of what made apple do this is that vaping is this
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.920]  Phenomenon, right it is and who knows where it's going
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:29.880]  Whereas the comparison to alcohol everybody knows what alcohol is and i'm betting that the numbers there's never been a two-year period
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:37.000]  Where the number of 12th graders who've consumed alcohol in the last 30 years has doubled or halved, you know, it fluctuates
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.280]  Yeah, you know
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:42.120]  You know marijuana is obviously getting more popular as it becomes legal in
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:47.400]  More places across the country and is therefore easier to obtain and our society has more of a hands-off
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:52.120]  Approach to it a decriminalization if not outright legalization, etc
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:59.480]  So of course that's going up but not doubling in two years, you know, and alcohol is, you know, rather steady and it's a known
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:04.600]  You know, it's around right it whereas vaping is this phenomenon and I feel like
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.520]  The phenomenal nature of it is partly what drove apple to say. Let's just
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:11.960]  Wash our hands of it for now at least until this settles down
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:14.200]  Yeah
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:17.480]  But I get I get the complaints I do and I get the argument that
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:23.480]  You know, we're all grown-ass adults and we should be able to make our own decision. It's about stuff. That's perfectly legal
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.040]  You know, nobody's argument gaping is illegal
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:32.120]  And that therefore who's apple to say that you know, none of us should be able to use these apps and stuff like that
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.600]  I totally get it. Yeah, I totally get why there's lots of there's lots of unhealthy stuff, you know, yeah
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:39.960]  Yeah for better
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  Like the news
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:47.480]  You know, it's like bad snacks and I don't know
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:55.240]  It's a weird one to me. I mean the whole vaping policy issue is like larger, but it's it's interesting where a company you know
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:00.520]  Feels the need to step in on something that isn't illegal. Yeah
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.800]  And the other thing that I think is really i'm very sensitive to it and hope that apple if they start walking this back
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:13.320]  To make some specific exemptions. I really hope that that the hardware control angle where your people use these apps
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:16.760]  Like the ones from pax who is apparently a top manufacturer
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:21.400]  You can use the app to actually control the temperature and whatever else and like verify
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.640]  You know, you said verify the that the pods or whatever you put in the thing. I don't know
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:31.640]  You put in the thing. I don't know but what you can verify that it's a legit pod containing legit vaping
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:39.160]  Source material and apparently a lot of the problems the health problems people have is with black market canisters or you know
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:47.560]  Anyway, there's no way for the company like that to to work around the lack of an app because like if you take away
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.760]  All of the porno apps you can just go to safari and get all of your pornography there
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  You know, you can ban if you're if you just want to know read reviews of vaping canisters
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:03.960]  You can just read them on the website on your phone. The lack of an app doesn't keep you from doing it
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.120]  whereas if you want to control your
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.920]  Your little vaping device. It has to be through the app. And so
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:16.360]  I feel like that makes a difference, you know in the hk maps live story from a few weeks ago again
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:20.120]  Tying multiple threads together here at the end of the show with apple and china
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.680]  One of the reasons I know i've talked to people at apple
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:25.640]  Off the record about it and they definitely you know
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.720]  One of the considerations that they took on this was that anybody with an iphone in hong kong could access their website
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:35.960]  And you can use the little feature to bookmark it as a app on your home screen
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.600]  The experience of doing that is almost in almost if not completely
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:48.360]  indistinguishable from the hk maps app that was in the app store because the hk maps app was really just a very thin wrapper around the
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.600]  Around the website and if anything
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:56.120]  They thought maybe that would have been a reason that it should have been rejected in the first place is because they actually have a long
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.640]  Standing rule that if your app is just a wrapper around the website
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:03.240]  It shouldn't be in the app store. You should just let people use the website
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.240]  Right, right. There's no there's no substitute for this. There's no there's no workaround. So it's a big idea, right?
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:16.040]  But there is any so anyway, I hope we'll see how that plays out that that about does it from my agenda for the show
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.080]  Yeah, uh, I we got on my my my air pods are yelling at me that they're running
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:26.600]  That's always that's always a good sign you've podcasted for a long time. There we go
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:33.720]  Uh, matthew iglesias you everybody can uh, see your work at vox.com where I believe you're like a co-founder
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:41.160]  You're you're a you know, if anything yeah, and you've been writing about my own podcast called the weeds the weeds, but it's not about weed
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:45.400]  No, it's about it's about public public policy weeds
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.880]  There's an entire one of the things I found in the app store in terms of like what's allowed and what's not allowed is
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.960]  There's an entire sub-genre of games where if you search for weed baron
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:00.120]  Where it's like your goal. It's like, you know, you run this it's iphone games
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.400]  I mean, it's a a category where you you are buying and selling marijuana and you know
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.800]  But they call it weed I guess to keep it legal
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:11.240]  Not not your podcast. The weeds is very different than the weed
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.960]  We're very very earnest
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.800]  Apologies. Yeah, vox.com at maddie. Iglesias on twitter. Yeah
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.800]  Yeah, can I tell you this? Can I just I want to say I can't let the show end without saying it that I
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:25.240]  I've been following your work forever. I mean a long long time
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:29.080]  I mean just I know that we've sort of came about came up at the same time
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:35.960]  In the early 2000s in the early days of blogging, you know, you were blogging at maddie iglesias.com I believe back in the day
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:42.920]  Yeah, there you go. It was, you know, one of my daily daily bookmarks top top three four sites of the time of the era
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:49.400]  Um ever since twitter though every time I see your twitter handle and I know your name. I know that you are matt
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.240]  You do you know what?
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:57.400]  I keep looking at your twitter handle and I for this is now for like 13 years and still to this day
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.400]  I look at it and I think maddie
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:02.920]  I wouldn't have i've from what I know of matt iglesias
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:07.320]  I would have never thought of him as a maddie. No, it was a huge
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.760]  Uh, you know, this is like one of these early questions and when I when I launched my twitter account
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.680]  Twitter wasn't a big thing. I didn't think it through I should have been matthew iglesias. Yeah
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.400]  or just iglesias or
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:26.680]  Yeah, right because I I don't have a ton of competition from my weirdly spelled boss name
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.920]  That's uh, that's the one thing I got going for me
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.960]  That's the one thing I got going for me gruber is surprisingly popular. It's the number one surname in austria
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.800]  So i'm often in a race
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:41.560]  I think there you go. I can usually get it on a us service and if it's international I lose out instantly
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:44.920]  So yeah, just don't don't don't don't go to the austrian internet, right?
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:53.080]  But anyway, not maddie iglesias matt iglesias on twitter also an excellent excellent twitter follow
[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:55.320]  Uh one of my favorites by far
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:59:00.040]  Uh, you're a you're a master both of the short form and the long form and uh, thank you so much
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.520]  Anyway, i'll have to have you back someday because this was a lot of fun
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:24.520]  Yeah, let's do it again. All right. All right. Thank you so much
