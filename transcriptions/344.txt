[00:00.000 --> 00:05.280]  Breaking news. Now, here's the danger of podcasting, because we've got a, you know,
[00:05.280 --> 00:16.240]  24 hour ideal turnaround on a podcast. And this Elon Musk Twitter thing is, is, is like,
[00:16.240 --> 00:24.000]  I just saw that that Apple signed Idris Elba to do a, did you see that? It's like a seven,
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.480]  it's going to be like a seven episode series about a transcontinental flight or transatlantic flight
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.400]  that gets hijacked, but it takes place in real time, you know? So like, so, so like,
[00:36.960 --> 00:39.760]  I know that's not new, but it's still, you know, it's Idris Elba. So I'm like, all right, that's
[00:39.760 --> 00:44.800]  great. Right. But it's, it's, it's like the old 24 gimmick or I forgot, I just linked to it,
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.680]  but there was a Johnny Depp movie in 1996 or something like that. There was, there are TV
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.200]  shows that did that too, like spy shows or something where it was supposed to be unfolding
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.280]  practically in real time. I think not 24, but like in the sixties anyway. Yeah. That's a,
[00:57.280 --> 01:01.760]  it's a great, that's a great idea because you know, you get the attention inherent in the
[01:01.760 --> 01:05.200]  premise and then they have to just tell a really good story inside that. All right. Now I gotta
[01:05.200 --> 01:11.600]  look it up. There was a Hitchcock movie that, that it took it even further. It was the premise was
[01:11.600 --> 01:18.720]  that it was yeah, rope. Exactly. And so tell people what the, the, the gimmick with rope
[01:18.720 --> 01:24.480]  wasn't just that it was real time, but continuous shots but they couldn't load, you know, they didn't
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.520]  have enough film in the cans in those days. So you'll notice throughout rope, there's people,
[01:29.520 --> 01:37.280]  the camera pans across the jacket back and then back in. So they shot every lengthy scene
[01:37.280 --> 01:42.960]  continue or continuously. So I think it's like five or seven, someone's going to correct us,
[01:43.680 --> 01:48.160]  separate shots, but all of them are continuous and they all pan across. You're like,
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.560]  boy, that's not that interesting of a someone's jacket back, but it's a, it's a, and it's a
[01:52.560 --> 01:58.640]  thrilling, terrifying, gripping movie. Cause it brings that immediacy of something like theater
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.880]  to the screen. I thought it was, it's amazing. Yeah. I, I there's one where it,
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.560]  the camera pans across a lamp and it makes no sense at all, but it's it. Once you understand
[02:08.560 --> 02:14.560]  that they could only put 10, it was like 10 minutes of film in a canister or nine minutes,
[02:14.560 --> 02:19.360]  something, something like nine or 10 minutes of film at 24 frames per second was the most you
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.160]  could put in a canister. It, you know, and that's the gimmick is that it's, it doesn't just take
[02:24.160 --> 02:32.560]  place in real time, but it simulates one 90 minute take. Anyway, I kind of feel like this Twitter,
[02:32.560 --> 02:40.320]  Elon Musk story is unfolding at that pace. And so anything we can say about it as we record
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.960]  on Monday morning is going to be hopelessly out of date by the time the podcast airs,
[02:46.960 --> 02:50.880]  who even knows, but it's true. It could be sold. It could be backed off. It could be,
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.920]  there's a tweet. I know this ironic. There's a tweet from Katie Mack, the astrophysicist,
[02:55.920 --> 03:01.040]  who's that terrific writer and terrific all round person. And she tweeted this morning. And I just
[03:01.040 --> 03:05.200]  think this summarizes everyone's feelings, including mine is I won't pretend to know how
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.760]  the Elon Musk acquisition of Twitter will turn out, but it's pretty striking that every comment
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.200]  I've seen from anyone whose opinion I respect has been expressing nothing but devastation,
[03:15.200 --> 03:20.640]  pessimism, and rage. I thought Katie got it. Well, Dr. Mack has it on top there.
[03:21.280 --> 03:27.200]  I have a bad feeling and I hope I'm wrong here. I'll just toss this out there. I have a very bad
[03:27.200 --> 03:34.800]  feeling that if this goes through and maybe even if it doesn't, that Twitter's going to have
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.560]  significant layoffs this week. They're very big. A friend of mine who works there just wrote to me,
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.560]  just like a sort of offhand, like, Hey, you know, this is how times change,
[03:44.560 --> 03:50.240]  but has a friend who used to work at it. Well, it just started and, and more or less said that
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.400]  the onboarding process, you know, and getting up to speed at the company was arduous compared to
[03:56.400 --> 04:01.280]  the rest of the places he'd worked in his career because it's such a big company. And my friend was
[04:01.280 --> 04:05.440]  like, wait a minute, you used to work at Apple. And he's like, and he was like, yeah, when I
[04:05.440 --> 04:12.080]  started at Apple and I think this was like 2006 or 2004 or somewhere around that era, he was like,
[04:12.080 --> 04:19.040]  Apple then was smaller than Twitter today. And it was just sort of a, like a light bulb moment of
[04:19.040 --> 04:23.680]  how big companies have gotten. Like, even if you don't think of it, Twitter obviously isn't
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.840]  a gigantic company because they're, they're being targeted to go private and you can't do that with
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.280]  a truly gigantic public company, but it is something and I just can't help but feel,
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.800]  and I do, I feel, I'm sure there are numerous people who work at Twitter who listen to the show,
[04:40.800 --> 04:46.320]  my sympathies go out for the tumult that, that, that everybody there is going through.
[04:46.320 --> 04:49.840]  Yeah. And you know, the engineering talent will leave and product managers, tons of,
[04:49.840 --> 04:54.960]  I mean, there's so much, what's the unemployment rate in California and in tech, it's, you know,
[04:54.960 --> 05:00.960]  probably 2% right now. So everybody who disagrees and there's been reports of some, you know,
[05:00.960 --> 05:05.840]  severe ideological disagreement, I am positive there are plenty of people, and rightly so,
[05:05.840 --> 05:11.840]  this is not criticizing people who like Elon Musk or, or appreciate the work he's done.
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.000]  I will be the first, I should be the first to acknowledge the work he has done in advancing
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.880]  civilization at the same time as he's the world's, you know, as the world's wealthiest person and
[05:20.880 --> 05:26.400]  world's biggest shitposter all in one. He's an incredible set of contradictions and he's
[05:26.400 --> 05:31.760]  both brilliant, but hasn't invented anything himself. He's really good at finding people
[05:31.760 --> 05:37.440]  and pushing them. He's kind of Steve Jobsian, but worse in his treatment of people. So it's very
[05:37.440 --> 05:43.120]  hard to defend how he gets to his goals, but on the other side, we wouldn't be anywhere near the
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.280]  electric car revolution we're in today if it weren't for him, because nobody else would be
[05:47.280 --> 05:52.640]  that shameless and horrible and whatever to get to this point. Anyway, but that said,
[05:52.640 --> 05:57.040]  I'm sure there's plenty of people inside Twitter who admire Musk and are like, this is great.
[05:57.040 --> 06:00.880]  There's a lot of stuff I don't like about Twitter. Twitter's really moribund, right? Like Jack had
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.920]  really vague goals and, you know, somebody, I mean, if you work there, you might be, this is
[06:05.920 --> 06:09.360]  great. Someone's going to come in. We're not going to be beholden to shareholders or the public
[06:09.360 --> 06:14.000]  market. They're going to shake stuff up. And anyway, I just cashed out my options and I got,
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.040]  you know, $5 million for working here for X years or whatever it might be. And they're going to be
[06:19.040 --> 06:22.720]  delighted with it, right? But other people, there'll be an exodus of people who don't like
[06:22.720 --> 06:27.920]  the change or who get cashed out in this deal and have no financial, you know, now they're like,
[06:27.920 --> 06:32.080]  well, why would I work for a private company where I don't agree with the goals entirely?
[06:32.080 --> 06:35.920]  I'm just going to go and start my foundation or go to work for another company where I'll probably
[06:35.920 --> 06:39.760]  make as much or more working at Twitter. So I think you're right. There'll be a big exodus
[06:39.760 --> 06:44.000]  and a couple, I bet, I mean, he's going to have a lot of debt to serve as Twitter will,
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.240]  and he personally, so he's going to have to search for, as we say, efficiencies.
[06:48.240 --> 06:53.120]  I'm not even passing judgment. I don't know if Twitter has a headcount that large, maybe it is
[06:53.120 --> 06:57.840]  too big. I don't know, but I can't figure out their finances. If you look at them at one point
[06:57.840 --> 07:02.880]  a few years ago, it said they were spending $800 million a year in R&D. And I was like, well, that's
[07:02.880 --> 07:07.760]  insane. But I don't think, I think it was how they characterize their work and they classified
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.600]  it that way, maybe for tax reasons, but they spend an awful lot of money for a company that
[07:13.600 --> 07:19.280]  maintains, you know, a simple text-based service with advertising and not to belittle the complexity
[07:19.280 --> 07:24.240]  of running something at scale. But it does seem like they spend a lot of money doing something
[07:24.240 --> 07:28.880]  that is at its heart requires a certain core efficiency and maybe they're not efficient in
[07:28.880 --> 07:35.760]  that role. I don't know. I don't know. Here's the thing I don't understand. And I hate to put you
[07:35.760 --> 07:41.840]  on the spot because if I don't understand it, I have no expectation that you do, but maybe you do
[07:41.840 --> 07:50.560]  because you, Glenn Fleischmann, seem to have a brain that soaks up esoteric information, right?
[07:50.560 --> 07:54.400]  This is right. Look, how did I win Jeopardy? Because I could tell you the cop, you know,
[07:54.400 --> 07:58.400]  where I frustrated Lex Friedman on a game show episode of the Incorporated of the Day because
[07:58.400 --> 08:03.200]  if you came in last in supplying your entries, if you had to answer a trivia question, I was last
[08:03.200 --> 08:09.600]  almost every time and I got almost 100% of the answers correct. There you go. So here's my
[08:09.600 --> 08:16.400]  question. Twitter is a publicly held company as we speak. As we speak. We check the clock. Yep,
[08:16.400 --> 08:23.360]  that's still true. All right. So, and I realized that there are laws surrounding how that the
[08:23.360 --> 08:30.000]  articles and corporation and, you know, you make files, you know, you have to comply with, I'm
[08:30.000 --> 08:39.840]  sure a phone book full of regulations just for the basics of being a publicly held company. But the
[08:39.840 --> 08:47.280]  basic idea though, is that there are thousands or millions of people out there who are the owners of
[08:47.280 --> 08:56.080]  Twitter because they own one or more shares. And so if you buy a share of Twitter for 50 bucks or
[08:56.080 --> 09:04.800]  whatever the cost is right now, then you own one out of X shares of Twitter where X is the number
[09:04.800 --> 09:14.880]  of shares of the company. I don't quite understand how Elon Musk and the board of Twitter are
[09:14.880 --> 09:25.760]  negotiating this sale. Like, so if the board says, okay, we'll do it 50 to 40, what's the price? Or
[09:25.760 --> 09:36.160]  54 or 20? Because 420 is Elon's favorite number. 54, 20. Okay, we'll do it. How does the board get
[09:36.160 --> 09:43.600]  to say that when all the other shareholders out there are like, I'm not selling my share. Like,
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.240]  what if you're a shareholder of Twitter and you're just like, I would like to hold on to it?
[09:48.240 --> 09:52.400]  Oh, you'd like the up scenario, right? Oh, no, I shouldn't say that. Is it an up? Yeah,
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.120]  it's where they're building all around the little house. And we had one of those actually in Seattle.
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.560]  There literally was an up house. There was a development. They were putting this huge thing
[10:00.560 --> 10:06.080]  and this little old lady refused to sell. And they built, it was the most wonderful thing. And then
[10:06.080 --> 10:10.640]  one of the construction workers befriended her, helped her in the last days, brought her food,
[10:10.640 --> 10:15.360]  like, not to convince her to sell. And then I think she left the house to him. Anyway,
[10:16.080 --> 10:19.760]  heartwarming story in the middle of SEC regulations, but it's not like that.
[10:19.760 --> 10:25.760]  You can't, you can withhold your shares. Like you don't, so a lot of stuff happens by majority,
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.320]  super majority or other voting rules. So you can't as an individual shareholder, unless you
[10:32.320 --> 10:35.920]  have a majority, you can't prevent a sale like this from happening. I mean,
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.200]  essentially they just send you money. They withdraw the shares from circulation in exchange
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.800]  for money. And that's kind of it. So I don't think, again, you're right. There's tons of
[10:46.800 --> 10:51.680]  regulations about it, I'm sure. But a lot of it has to do with what the board thinks they're doing
[10:51.680 --> 10:57.200]  that's in the best interest of shareholders. So if the board thinks that Elon Musk's offer,
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.280]  which a lot of people think is too low, by the way, because Twitter was trading high last year,
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.760]  and maybe they'll come up with an agreement for a higher amount, but I think he's maxing out his
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.040]  credit facilities and cash on hand and all the rest of it. But if they accept his offer,
[11:11.040 --> 11:14.480]  then I don't think they have to put it to a vote for the shareholders because they
[11:14.480 --> 11:20.160]  believe they're acting in the best interests and they can allow him to tender for the entire amount
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.480]  and then, whether he doesn't own, and then just say, this is the deal, we've approved it, and
[11:24.480 --> 11:27.040]  you're all going to get cash on this day and it'll just be converted.
[11:27.040 --> 11:31.760]  Yeah, so anyway, I guess long story short, what you're saying is that the way publicly held
[11:31.760 --> 11:39.920]  companies are structured is sort of an instance of representative democracy, where the board
[11:40.720 --> 11:47.600]  is the, you know, officially, nobody really thinks that, like when you buy stock,
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.360]  you don't really think like, now I get to vote for who's on the board, you know,
[11:51.360 --> 12:00.480]  in the way that you vote for your congressperson or for a candidate for president or the mayor of
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.680]  your town. You don't really think of that, but you do, you get to vote. There's an annual
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.760]  shareholders meeting and they reassert the board, but effectively, you as a shareholder are deferring
[12:11.760 --> 12:20.640]  your direct control over something like, should we allow billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.560]  and take it private? You're deferring that decision to the board.
[12:25.120 --> 12:29.440]  Yeah, that's, I think that's a really good way of thinking about it. It's representative democracy,
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.640]  is you have an opportunity as shareholders to vote board members in and out, to, depending on the
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.440]  board, to make changes in policy, to, you know, control some of the direction of the company,
[12:39.440 --> 12:44.240]  but traditionally, courts defer, if there's a lawsuit that arises, courts defer traditionally
[12:44.240 --> 12:50.400]  to a board as long as it's making what seemed to be good decisions. So Matt Levine, who I'm sure
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.360]  we might talk about again, who's great, his statement is everything is securities fraud,
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.720]  because you can always, you can always attempt a lawsuit as a shareholder, as an interested party,
[13:00.720 --> 13:05.200]  and say, oh, they didn't disclose this or they did this action and therefore they
[13:05.200 --> 13:09.520]  reduce the value of the stock. It's really hard when the stock value goes up or it's something
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.480]  that's considered widely a good deal and everything has been negotiated perfectly well with all the
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.800]  documentation. But that aside, it's, yeah, you have some, ostensibly, you know, the modern
[13:20.800 --> 13:25.840]  structure is that companies have two or more classes of shares. So when they go public,
[13:25.840 --> 13:31.280]  one class may be held by founders and early insiders and early investors that has, you know,
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.040]  10 times the voting rights per share as the other shares. So they're all worth the same as a share
[13:37.040 --> 13:41.760]  of the company. But that's, you know, Zuckerberg has, I think there's 60% insider control of
[13:41.760 --> 13:46.400]  Facebook, but there's also a voting share thing. Twitter does not have different classes. So there's
[13:46.400 --> 13:53.520]  nobody who can kind of exercise extra authority, but Tesla put in effect, this rule is a two-third
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.480]  majority requirement for certain kinds of changes, including removing the two-third majority.
[13:58.480 --> 14:06.240]  And it means that because of current ownership, 90% of non-Elon Musk and other close insiders
[14:06.240 --> 14:11.760]  would have to vote to make a change for that change to exceed, you know, a three-quarter or
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.400]  two-thirds majority to actually enact the change. Anyway, so there's all these rules that prevent
[14:16.400 --> 14:21.120]  shareholders from necessarily exercising the kind of direct relationship that they had,
[14:21.120 --> 14:26.000]  one person, one vote kind of relationship for majority response. But anyway, yeah, it's,
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.640]  I mean, it's a funny thing. It's like somebody comes along and says, I want to give you this
[14:28.640 --> 14:31.520]  much money. And the board says, do you really have that much money? And they say, yeah,
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.880]  here I've proven it. And the board says, yeah, it's a pretty good deal. And they take it. And
[14:34.880 --> 14:39.840]  that's kind of the whole discussion. I mean, if the board, if he had come along and offered $20
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.920]  a share, the stock might've plunged because people thought maybe that indicated Twitter was in a
[14:43.920 --> 14:48.640]  position of weakness, but instead the stock is trending towards the price that Musk offered,
[14:48.640 --> 14:52.480]  which means maybe that is the market price. And maybe this is the best deal Twitter could
[14:52.480 --> 14:59.040]  get at the moment. It's all very confusing to me. It's amazing how much coverage there's been of it
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.600]  for something where it's like guy has some amount of money, right? He's the richest person in the
[15:03.600 --> 15:08.080]  world, but so much of his money is tied up in stock. And then the aforementioned Matt Levine
[15:08.080 --> 15:13.040]  has had to write a lot about this. He has a free newsletter at Bloomberg that I read. I think it's
[15:13.040 --> 15:17.280]  possibly the only thing besides Daring Fireball that I read every day, and you don't update
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.640]  Daring Fireball every day. So I got to go somewhere, Jon. I got to go somewhere.
[15:20.640 --> 15:33.680]  JS. Matt Levine doesn't write every day either. He is extraordinarily prolific. Former Goldman Sachs
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.480]  partner, I don't know what you call people like that, but he stepped aside from actually being
[15:38.480 --> 15:46.000]  an investment banker to write about the industry and is just a natural born columnist. I don't know
[15:46.000 --> 15:46.880]  how else to say it.
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.680]  JS. Right. He just has an incredible, yeah, it's like those old style, was it Herb Kane or
[15:51.680 --> 15:55.760]  something like those old style newspaper columnist, except he's writing a hundred percent about
[15:55.760 --> 16:00.640]  finance. And I laugh and laugh as I read his columns because he has such a good sense of humor
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.600]  and there's stuff I, you know, I have good financial literacy, I think, and it is so much
[16:05.600 --> 16:09.680]  better having read his newsletter. And his point with the Twitter deal, he broke apart
[16:10.480 --> 16:16.000]  Musk's offer last week where he must kind of put up what specifically he was going to bring to the
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.000]  table, like which piles of cash. And Levine's response was kind of like, well, Twitter has
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.240]  about a billion dollars in cash flow or free cash flow right now. So a billion dollars would
[16:28.240 --> 16:31.840]  service all the debt that's going to be put on it as part of this deal because some of it is
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.640]  leveraged. It's going to be, Twitter has to actually take on debt for Musk to acquire it.
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.520]  And then Musk himself will probably have to pay about a billion dollars, you know, roughly to
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.000]  service his own debt. So to buy Twitter, it's going to cost, you know, $2 billion a year just to
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.600]  service that purchase. And Musk has said he wants to get rid of advertising and change the service.
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.040]  He'll probably make it less desirable for advertisers based on all the statements
[16:55.600 --> 17:00.080]  he's made. So, and then Musk is leveraging, I mean, this is the column he wrote last week,
[17:00.800 --> 17:07.040]  he's leveraging stock he owns in Tesla. So he already had made personal guarantees against a
[17:07.040 --> 17:11.920]  chunk of his stock ownership and this will tie up a chunk more and he hasn't exercised a bunch
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.560]  of options, but it would essentially, Musk would have to use what sounds like all of his available
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.080]  cash and a chunk of his remaining control of Tesla at its current price. So if something goes wrong
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.920]  with Tesla, if there's a blip and the price goes down, he will have to sell more and sell stock or
[17:27.920 --> 17:32.240]  exercise options. If there were a significant decline in Tesla shares, he could wind up losing
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.040]  control of Tesla and there could be other repercussions that would regard his private
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.960]  ownership of Twitter and the bank's loans and so forth. So he's putting himself in what feels like
[17:42.960 --> 17:50.000]  a very risky, highly leveraged position in order to shitpost freely. I don't think that's why he's
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.880]  doing it though, but who knows? Why do you think he's doing it? Why do you think he's doing it?
[17:52.880 --> 17:57.440]  Let's take a break and we'll come back to it. I'm going to thank our first sponsor. It is
[17:57.440 --> 18:04.320]  Mack Weldon. I am loaded up with Mack Weldon on my body as I read you this ad right now. It is
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.440]  no secret though that we all want to look our best this spring. Mack Weldon is the expert when it
[18:09.440 --> 18:15.120]  comes to essential clothing that's perfect for the cold or the warm. They have stuff that is great
[18:15.120 --> 18:20.640]  when it's hot. They have clothes that are great when it's cold and they have everything in between
[18:20.640 --> 18:26.720]  and whether you are looking to upgrade your sweats collection or you just need gear that stands up to
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.520]  the changing weather of spring, Mack Weldon has exactly what you're looking for. And if that's
[18:31.520 --> 18:37.280]  not convenient enough, let me tell you about their daily wear system. That is where all of the
[18:37.280 --> 18:43.360]  clothes work together for real. You could be headed to work, to the office. You could be going for a
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.960]  run. You could just be hanging out on the couch at home with your laptop. It doesn't matter. They've
[18:48.960 --> 18:55.840]  got clothes that will work together for you and it takes no effort. I have so much Mack Weldon
[18:55.840 --> 19:00.720]  clothing. It is ridiculous. And I know if you're listening to the show for a long time, you know
[19:00.720 --> 19:05.120]  they've sponsored the show for a long time. I wouldn't tell you this though. If it weren't true,
[19:05.120 --> 19:11.920]  their stuff is just ridiculously comfortable and it lasts forever. This is the one thing
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.280]  that I cannot emphasize enough because they've been sponsoring the show for years and I have no
[19:17.280 --> 19:24.240]  idea which of my Mack Weldon stuff is old from like years ago when I first learned about them
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.440]  and which is the stuff I bought like a couple months ago because it all holds up so well. You
[19:29.440 --> 19:34.400]  can buy like the same shirt and you realize, oh, I really like that shirt. I should get a couple
[19:34.400 --> 19:39.440]  more, maybe get some different colors. Two, three years later, it looks exactly like the ones you
[19:39.440 --> 19:45.680]  bought two, three years ago. It is absolutely crazy. Hoodies, underwear, socks, pants,
[19:46.560 --> 19:51.680]  everything that you could possibly want. Mack Weldon has them. They are absolutely terrific.
[19:51.680 --> 19:58.800]  Check out Mack Weldon for yourself. And by using this code, you are going to save 20% on your first
[19:58.800 --> 20:10.560]  order. Go to Mack, M-A-C-K Weldon, L-W-E-L-D-O-N, mackweldon.com slash the talk show pod. That's the

[20:19.040 --> 20:27.200]  the clothes. They've got great stuff for spring. Why? I don't know why he's buying Twitter, Glenn.
[20:28.320 --> 20:35.280]  I don't think though it's, I don't think. Glenn Do you think it's because he's mad that he can't
[20:35.280 --> 20:42.400]  do everything he wants? I mean, like everything he said publicly makes me think that he doesn't,
[20:42.400 --> 20:46.240]  you know, this is what a lot of, a lot of very entitled people and people grew up extremely
[20:46.240 --> 20:49.920]  wealthy as he did. They, and I went to school with a number of those people.
[20:49.920 --> 20:53.280]  Did he grow up wealthy? I actually don't know like his childhood.
[20:53.280 --> 20:58.240]  His family owns a gem mines in South Africa. So he started, he is not a plucky,
[20:58.240 --> 21:02.720]  started from nothing person. I mean, Steve Jobs, you know, grew up in a middle-class family. He
[21:02.720 --> 21:06.800]  certainly wasn't deprived, but he wasn't, family wasn't wealthy. Yeah. I mean, that's one of these
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.440]  origin story things like where you're, you have to poke at how much money somebody's family did when
[21:11.440 --> 21:14.000]  they said, well, I started with nothing. I had to go out and raise money. It's like, well,
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.040]  you raise money from your family. They give you a bunch of money. But so, but Musk, he seems to be
[21:19.040 --> 21:24.160]  somebody who doesn't want to have the word no sent to him. And his disputes with the SCC have largely
[21:24.160 --> 21:29.760]  to do in my opinion, with him wanting to be able to say anything he wants, regardless of whether
[21:29.760 --> 21:35.440]  he can back it up with facts or belief or just invent them and not have the SCC have any
[21:35.440 --> 21:41.360]  regulatory oversight over that because he thinks everything he does is good for good for his
[21:41.360 --> 21:47.200]  company. And the aforementioned Matt Levine, one of his arguments is that maybe what Musk does has
[21:47.200 --> 21:51.920]  been good and the SCC is kind of wrong at some level, even though it's right, but it's wrong
[21:51.920 --> 21:57.840]  because Tesla is an incredibly valuable company. And so what has Musk done that has devalued any
[21:57.840 --> 22:03.280]  of the enterprises? The answer is kind of none. So you have to look at it, is it like this school
[22:03.280 --> 22:08.000]  rules thing where it's like, well, we have to slap your hand because we don't want other people
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.600]  getting ideas, or is it, you know, adherence to the rules? Now, I know I think what he's
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.680]  done is sometimes could be construed under certain circumstances to be misleading. And the SCC has
[22:17.680 --> 22:22.720]  agreed with some of that. And sometimes he's even agreed to make changes to his behavior and then
[22:22.720 --> 22:29.200]  not changed it. And I think that kind of, it's like not wanting to have to stifle himself. It
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.520]  just seems like one of the big motivations. And maybe he thinks Twitter's actually undervalued,
[22:33.520 --> 22:36.240]  but then he says, I don't want to do business stuff with it.
[22:36.240 --> 22:39.040]  Jay Famiglietti I can't help but think, though, that he
[22:39.040 --> 22:47.680]  knows enough that it's too much money and too much of his own worth that he's not,
[22:49.680 --> 23:01.280]  the problem is, I think we as a species are not hooked up to deal with somebody who is both,
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.440]  who is consequential. He's a consequential person, right? And he does things. But we're not hooked
[23:07.440 --> 23:14.240]  up to deal with somebody who is consequential, who is a leader in some regards, right? He's
[23:14.240 --> 23:23.280]  obviously the leader of several companies, whose words aren't necessarily what he's actually
[23:23.280 --> 23:30.000]  thinking. And I hesitated over how to phrase that, because I'm not saying he's even a liar.
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.360]  It's just that there's a certain, and I think Elon Musk personifies it. I think even more,
[23:37.360 --> 23:43.040]  I think it's one of those ways that he is sort of Steve Jobs-like, you know, there's,
[23:43.680 --> 23:47.760]  you know, I've mentioned it on on my show before, I think I've mentioned it on Dithering
[23:48.400 --> 23:52.640]  with Ben Thompson, it, you know, you can definitely draw some connections. But
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.000]  at that level, everybody is so unique that it's hard to, you know, you could say, oh,
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.880]  they're also like Thomas Edison, and you can go back through history and find other people. But
[24:04.160 --> 24:10.240]  basically, you can't necessarily take him at his word, but I don't mean that he's a liar,
[24:10.240 --> 24:16.800]  it's that he says things to get a reaction, and that he thinks he's playing, and maybe he is,
[24:16.800 --> 24:23.440]  right? He's obviously very, very smart, extremely smart. And so maybe he is playing two moves ahead
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.840]  of everybody else. But so therefore, the things that he says, he, whatever his reasons are,
[24:29.840 --> 24:36.960]  they're not what he says. Whereas me, and I think you, and I think most people, it's like,
[24:36.960 --> 24:41.840]  whatever I'm actually thinking, that's the stupid words that are coming out of my mouth.
[24:41.840 --> 24:46.800]  Well, we have too much at stake, I think is the issue is relative, like, we don't have FU money,
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.200]  right? We have, and if we did, we have ethics and morals that would prevent us from
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.120]  shading the truth very far in even in extreme cases, let's, you know, gun to the head,
[24:57.120 --> 25:03.040]  maybe we'd say something, I don't know. But the Musk says things that are expedient to him,
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.640]  and sometimes very well calculated. So when he said, Tesla's going to go public at $420
[25:08.640 --> 25:13.040]  and 69 shares, I think, right, it was the joke. And, you know, he got the SEC, you know,
[25:13.040 --> 25:16.880]  trying to put enforcement action against him, I can't really exact what the exact outcome was
[25:16.880 --> 25:21.760]  of that. Again, he always gets his hands slapped. He's supposed to have his statements reviewed by
[25:21.760 --> 25:27.360]  lawyers of the company and blah, blah, blah. But what he claimed later is he said, I believed when
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.560]  I tweeted that, that we were prepared to do that. And we had, you know, this investment lined up
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.720]  from the Saudis. And, you know, apparently the deal was the Saudis said, yeah, we might do
[25:36.720 --> 25:41.120]  something with you. Not, you know, no, nothing in writing, nothing specific, no dollar amounts
[25:41.120 --> 25:46.960]  discussed. So Musk's argument about that is, I mean, or I think, let's say his internal thinking,
[25:46.960 --> 25:53.200]  if I can be so bold, is by stating it, he probably made the deal much more likely. So by saying,
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.480]  I have an offer, we're going to go private, this is the thing. The Saudis might have said,
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.400]  oh, he's really serious about it. Yep, let's throw up the term sheet and figure out financing,
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.400]  and he's got to do this. And how much can we push him now that he set a price? And it might've just
[26:04.400 --> 26:11.680]  happened. So some people want to cause reality to, or to change reality by making statements that
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.720]  they believe they can bring into reality by having put them forward, right? The trial balloon that
[26:16.720 --> 26:22.000]  becomes reality. And I think he is, he believes he is a master at that. And I think he is much
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.200]  more like a little boy who thinks he's clever about things like that. Yeah. And, but isn't that
[26:27.200 --> 26:36.560]  a little Steve Jobs-like, right? And it was sort of like, I mean, the biggest failure of Jobs's
[26:36.560 --> 26:43.360]  career clearly was Next while it was a standalone company. It never really took off. And it was a
[26:43.360 --> 26:51.360]  long bet that eventually did pay off famously when Apple acquired the company and let their
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.800]  executives come in and become the new executives of Apple and use their technology as the
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.440]  foundation for macOS 10, which became the foundation for iOS. And here we are today.
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.360]  But, but like, you listen to what Steve Jobs said about Next, you know, like back in the
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.760]  era when Steve Jobs was wearing a suit, you know, like he, he was sort of lost, right? It wasn't
[27:13.760 --> 27:20.560]  himself. And he was saying things and trying to bring it into reality just by saying it. And,
[27:20.560 --> 27:27.920]  and I see that with Elon Musk and that to me, maybe I'm being an optimist here, you know,
[27:27.920 --> 27:34.480]  in terms of what would Twitter, how, how would Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership and leadership
[27:34.480 --> 27:41.200]  be different than Twitter as it is today? I tend to think it won't be as different as some people
[27:41.200 --> 27:48.880]  fear, you know, cause I think he keeps emphasizing this free speech angle that, that it's the town,
[27:48.880 --> 27:57.040]  town square of the whole world. And it hasn't been run in a way that he deems sufficiently
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.280]  pro free speech. And people hear that and they let's face it. They immediately think of Donald
[28:05.280 --> 28:14.080]  Trump who got kicked off the platform while he was president and Trump like people. I mean,
[28:14.080 --> 28:22.080]  people are worried about racists and people who are hate filled people who are trying to
[28:22.080 --> 28:30.640]  antagonize and demean and hurt people who across the political spectrum, right? You, you name it,
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.520]  what you're worried about, you're worried. And people are worried that under Elon Musk,
[28:35.520 --> 28:41.840]  Twitter is going to open up to that. But I, I don't really see how that's all that feasible,
[28:41.840 --> 28:48.000]  right? Like even if he started making some dictums in that director, in that direction,
[28:48.720 --> 28:55.920]  it would go so bad so quickly that I'm not quite sure how it would maintain, right? Like,
[28:55.920 --> 29:03.120]  and, and if it really turns into a hellscape of right-wing hate or, or whatever people are
[29:03.120 --> 29:08.960]  worried about where, where it could go, it, it would sink the platform, right? I mean,
[29:08.960 --> 29:15.200]  that's sort of the reason that all of these Twitter wannabe sites that keep popping up,
[29:15.200 --> 29:18.240]  right? There's, I mean, how many are there?
[29:18.240 --> 29:20.880]  Parler, Gab, Truth Social.
[29:20.880 --> 29:26.000]  Getter, right? Which is really weird, right? Like, it's like, where, where'd you get that name?
[29:26.000 --> 29:26.800]  2007?
[29:27.840 --> 29:32.880]  They didn't put a, they didn't put a second E in it. I think you're, I think, right, so the problem
[29:32.880 --> 29:37.360]  is we can't imagine what Elon Musk would do with Twitter because he's floated so many proposals,
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.720]  many of them inane and, and absolutely would cause harm to the service and people on it.
[29:42.720 --> 29:48.960]  So if he were the king of Twitter tomorrow, does he just say, look at my old tweets and do all that
[29:48.960 --> 29:55.280]  stuff? Or does he take a more measured look? And, you know, I just had to look up the market cap of
[29:55.280 --> 29:59.360]  Tesla just for reference, right? And it's a trillion dollar company. So for everybody who
[29:59.360 --> 30:04.560]  thought, you know, I, I really thought Tesla was going to crash and burn because I thought
[30:04.560 --> 30:08.240]  they'd taken too many risks or over-leveraged. They couldn't produce the cars. And there's plenty
[30:08.240 --> 30:11.520]  people who have complaints about like build quality and software. Like there's a lot of
[30:11.520 --> 30:15.520]  things you can say about it, but it's still, they're selling a whole bunch of cars. They led
[30:15.520 --> 30:21.040]  the industry on it and they're worth a trillion dollars. So there's a market belief in two senses,
[30:21.040 --> 30:26.720]  like the market willing to buy those products and, and invest in the company based on what it
[30:26.720 --> 30:31.760]  thinks the future value will be. Same with SpaceX. Say SpaceX seemed like a little bit of a pipe
[30:31.760 --> 30:37.200]  dream and then they've done incredible things. And I'm not going to say Musk is in there, you know,
[30:37.760 --> 30:44.640]  doodling equations on a big chalkboard, but he certainly has, without his leadership, I don't
[30:44.640 --> 30:48.800]  know what would have happened because of his particular, you know, the jobs, like the demanding
[30:48.800 --> 30:54.000]  style and other things he does that may have made it happen. So, so you can't believe if you go in
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.040]  thinking, I mean, part of me says, John, we have to expect the worst and it's going to become a
[30:59.040 --> 31:02.880]  whole, it's already a hell hole because Twitter doesn't know what's bad about their service and
[31:02.880 --> 31:07.680]  what's good. They absolutely do not understand the current management. Jack Dorsey, they don't
[31:07.680 --> 31:12.880]  understand what is good about Twitter. What they think is good about Twitter is engagement and
[31:12.880 --> 31:19.280]  getting an amplification where I think what's good about Twitter is, is sort of community and trust.
[31:19.280 --> 31:25.040]  And so they, you know, you trust circles of people, you know, on Twitter and Twitter has
[31:25.040 --> 31:29.200]  never really done much to help with that besides the blue check mark, which isn't really a help,
[31:29.200 --> 31:32.800]  but they, you know, they measure it by, so the other newsletter I read every day is
[31:32.800 --> 31:39.680]  Ryan Broderick's Garbage Day, which is kind of like a concierge to all the churn that's happening.
[31:39.680 --> 31:43.840]  So I don't know what's going on with, with TikTok and Tumblr. Tumblr is kind of back. There's a lot
[31:43.840 --> 31:48.320]  of interesting stuff going on there. How YouTube algorithms work. And Ryan is a, was a Beatrice
[31:48.320 --> 31:53.520]  to Dante, right? He takes you into the hell of social media and kind of shows you what's going
[31:53.520 --> 31:56.320]  on. I'm actually, I'm sorry, Beatrice took you to heaven, but whatever. So I don't want to make
[31:56.320 --> 32:01.040]  my wrong classical references, but so Ryan Broderick has made the argument that Twitter
[32:01.040 --> 32:07.600]  is fundamentally a broken service like previous ones have because it's unable to prevent internet
[32:07.600 --> 32:13.200]  main figures of the day, like main characters. And the fact that somebody can become, can make,
[32:13.200 --> 32:21.120]  you know, an innocuous, maybe hairless, maybe irritating comment or threat of tweets. And then
[32:21.120 --> 32:26.320]  suddenly 10 million people are talking about that person for 24 hours straight. What, is there
[32:26.320 --> 32:32.320]  anything good or useful about that? And so he says, like previous services that broke, you can
[32:32.320 --> 32:37.440]  kind of tell the Twitter broke when the internet main character of the day thing started to become
[32:37.440 --> 32:43.280]  quite routine because it showed that the service was unable to prevent kind of targeting,
[32:43.280 --> 32:48.480]  harassment, amplification of things that didn't need to be amplified. And so could,
[32:48.480 --> 32:54.800]  so my question is in that, does Musk come in and make that worse? Does he say everyone who is
[32:54.800 --> 32:59.280]  banned for a particular reason as opposed to because of spam or scam or pornography or whatever,
[32:59.280 --> 33:03.280]  we're going to unban all those people on day one. So Trump is back and all these people on the
[33:03.280 --> 33:08.160]  right are back, but also all the trans activists who got banned because they said, I wish people
[33:08.160 --> 33:12.560]  who were not, you know, who were opposing us would die in a fire, which is a lot of people like that.
[33:12.560 --> 33:16.800]  So there's, there are people who have been what seemed like illegitimately banned who might be
[33:16.800 --> 33:21.440]  restored as well. Although one believes that's a smaller number, but still, so is that what's
[33:21.440 --> 33:26.080]  going to happen? Are they all in banned? And then does he start saying, well, we're not putting any
[33:26.080 --> 33:30.080]  restrictions on it. So you can't, you know, you can't, we're not going to use a trust and safety
[33:30.080 --> 33:34.400]  to prevent certain categories of tweets. We're removing the report tweet feature
[33:34.400 --> 33:40.800]  except for spam and you know, child pornography slash CSAM, things like that. Right. And if that
[33:40.800 --> 33:44.800]  happened, I think, you know, I think you're right. If he did that very quickly, it would
[33:44.800 --> 33:50.400]  descend into a morass of complete unusability. Like, forget whether you like the tone or not.
[33:50.400 --> 33:55.760]  I think it would just simply be unusable. And, and would he do that to Twitter? I don't think so,
[33:55.760 --> 34:00.000]  cause I don't think that's his end goal. Right. Cause he's not buying it for a song.
[34:00.560 --> 34:05.840]  Right. It's not like Twitter. Collaborating his own future. Yeah. It's, it's really,
[34:05.840 --> 34:12.080]  it's a lot of money. Right. And Twitter is in this and has been for most of its lifetime
[34:12.080 --> 34:18.320]  in like this weird, no, no person's land between massive success like Facebook. Right. Which has
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.560]  been the comparison because the eras have, have, have overlapped. So almost so completely.
[34:25.120 --> 34:34.800]  And in the same way that Apple in the nineties suffered very poorly in comparison to Microsoft,
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.960]  more so than Intel, but even, you know, that the two halves of the
[34:38.960 --> 34:47.840]  Wintel duopoly, Microsoft and Intel, Microsoft was the one that the investor world would look at and
[34:47.840 --> 34:55.280]  say, my God, they're printing money and they're doing it by licensing software. Therefore what
[34:55.280 --> 35:02.160]  Apple should do is licensed software. And, you know, and it was like, eventually they gave in,
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.480]  in, in a moment of weakness, they were like, fine, we'll do a clone thing. We'll license
[35:06.480 --> 35:13.680]  the Mac OS. And it turned out every bit as poorly as anybody could have, you know, predicted,
[35:14.240 --> 35:19.920]  but it was all because of that comparison. And I think what Microsoft in the nineties was to
[35:19.920 --> 35:27.840]  Twitter or was to Apple Facebook for the last 15 years or so has been to Twitter, which is sort of
[35:27.840 --> 35:35.200]  like the investors look at Facebook and maybe that this comparison stopped about two years ago
[35:35.200 --> 35:42.400]  when the whole world sort of woke up to Facebook being a problematic company. And people are no
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.160]  longer saying this company should be like Facebook. Like, like there's sort of a consensus that,
[35:48.160 --> 35:53.760]  Hey, nobody should be like Facebook. This company is sort of sketchy, but, but for about a 15 year
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.160]  stretch or 10, you know, a 10, 10 plus year stretch there, there was this, you know,
[35:58.160 --> 36:03.840]  Twitter should be more like Facebook and monetize like Facebook and track people like Facebook.
[36:03.840 --> 36:11.280]  And if, you know, and grow like Facebook and try to literally get every single person on the planet
[36:11.280 --> 36:17.040]  who could feasibly have access to a device that could access the service to be on the service,
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.280]  right. Which is the scale that's literally, I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous, but that's
[36:21.280 --> 36:28.400]  the scale Facebook operates on is that almost every person on the planet who could be using
[36:28.400 --> 36:35.840]  Facebook is using one or more Facebook services, including me, right. I've never signed up for
[36:35.840 --> 36:41.920]  Facebook proper, but I do use Instagram. I use WhatsApp now. It's, you know, it, it,
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.960]  it's diminishingly small how many people could be using it who aren't and Twitter isn't like that.
[36:46.960 --> 36:54.880]  Twitter doesn't have that kind of reach except they kind of do because people who watch TV,
[36:54.880 --> 37:02.640]  like you watch TV news and things people tweet. I'm sure as we're podcasting right now on CNBC,
[37:02.640 --> 37:07.760]  people are talking about what Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend about Twitter and about Bill
[37:07.760 --> 37:12.160]  Gates, which is bizarre. You know, Twitter for, for a lot of people,
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.080]  Twitter is the old, like Times Square, a little reader board thing, right? The little,
[37:16.080 --> 37:22.160]  the LEDs marker lights marching around Twitter is, you know, Donald Trump puts out telegrams,
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.120]  not telegrams of the service. It's as there is no other way to get, I mean,
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.960]  I think the unfettered access even to official statements sometimes was amazing. And then you
[37:32.960 --> 37:37.360]  have the weird examples of like Chinese authorities ridiculing people directly,
[37:37.360 --> 37:43.520]  countries and people on Twitter and Trump, you know, acting like a baby on Twitter, which was,
[37:43.520 --> 37:47.600]  you know, nothing would ever have allowed that to be seen before. So yeah, Twitter becomes a
[37:47.600 --> 37:52.480]  news story and there's, you know, the constant narrative is that people spend, media people
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.200]  spend too much time on Twitter, talking to people on Twitter and listening to people on Twitter.
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.960]  And they miss the story of all the people who don't engage on Twitter. And I suspect as with
[38:02.960 --> 38:08.720]  all everything, there's always the Clay Shirky's old power law curve essay, which is now 20 plus
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.880]  years old, which was about blogs and other stuff, you know, popularity and kind of the big head and
[38:12.880 --> 38:18.080]  the long tail and the kind of middle part and where there's people get some engagement or some
[38:18.080 --> 38:24.800]  involvement, but they are not enough to make a big move. And you look at Twitter and I think,
[38:25.440 --> 38:29.440]  I don't know, I've seen the numbers before, however many hundreds of millions of people have
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.200]  actively used it or have registered accounts. And it's a very tiny number of people tweet at all.
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.080]  And of those people, a very tiny number get any real engagement and then a very, very tiny number
[38:40.080 --> 38:46.400]  get substantial engagement. So it's kind of a weird set of nested thought and flogged megaphones.
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.040]  And so some people have megaphones inside megaphones inside megaphones and they sound
[38:51.040 --> 38:54.640]  really loud and others are like, Hey, I'm talking here. And nobody, nobody hears them, you know,
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.400]  kind of like old live journal blogs and versus, you know, blog that was something like, I don't
[38:58.400 --> 39:02.640]  know, Boing Boing it's day or so I feel, I think you're totally right. Is it Twitter's
[39:03.440 --> 39:08.960]  Twitter's a capability of being different than Facebook while still being a microblogging service
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.680]  has really not been exploited. I feel like nothing creative has happened to Twitter in a long time.
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.400]  They keep messing with threads. They changed the character count a while ago. I signed up for
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.880]  Twitter blue, which is what, three bucks a month? Because I thought I wanted to see what it was like
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.840]  and I wanted to encourage them in the experiment. And I will say, I think the primary feature I use
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.320]  is that you have 30 seconds to undo a tweet before it's sent and that's where I find my typos. So
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.360]  I'll do, Oh no, I'd be to type undo it, fix it and resend it. So, you know, even something as basic
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.000]  as an edit button, button, which requires a lot of philosophical thought that hasn't been rolled
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.240]  out. You know, I've had this example, John, I think this is the best example you could have.
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.200]  Your cat's gone missing. Do you post it on Twitter? No, because it's going to reach everybody
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.240]  in the world. So why isn't there geographical, you know, geo-bounding on Twitter? Why aren't there
[39:58.240 --> 40:03.120]  ways to set up discussion groups on Twitter that use the Twitter interface? Why can't you have
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.000]  something that's almost Slack-like, like a private Twitter inside Twitter that you paid for as a
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.840]  company or as a small organization? You can, and why do it there? Because you're building on the
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.640]  identity system that they have, which is tremendous. Yeah, exactly. I mean, why is sign in with
[40:18.640 --> 40:22.560]  Twitter, sign in with Facebook, sign in with Apple? Why are those useful? It's because,
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.840]  and Google too, obviously, it's because a federated identity is an extremely useful thing to
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.280]  leverage. And so Slack and all the other systems have single sign-on and federated identity tools
[40:33.280 --> 40:38.640]  as well. And Twitter could be the place we go to. I mean, like here, I'm writing their marketing
[40:38.640 --> 40:43.760]  for them. Twitter could be the place you go to, to have all the kinds of casual discussions you
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.280]  need. Because Slack is often overkill. Discord can kind of, it's a great tool. I'm in like,
[40:50.240 --> 40:56.160]  I pay for a podcast supporter of two podcasts. I pay them monthly because I like them so much.
[40:56.160 --> 41:01.760]  And I'm in discords for both of them. And neither podcast is super popular. I mean,
[41:01.760 --> 41:05.120]  they're listened to by a reasonable number of people, but they're not, you know,
[41:05.120 --> 41:10.720]  not talk show audience. I will be very frank, much more than that. And the discords are so busy,
[41:10.720 --> 41:16.000]  I would have to devote myself full time to each of those to keep up. So there's all these communities.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.880]  Twitter could have figured out a way, not to build Discord, not to rebuild Slack,
[41:20.880 --> 41:25.600]  but to create a sense where you could have micro communities that are controlled.
[41:25.600 --> 41:30.960]  I mean, this is what, I'm blanking on his name, micro.blog. That's what, yeah, he's great. And
[41:30.960 --> 41:35.040]  that's a great service, you know, and our good friend, Jean McDonald is involved in that too,
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.560]  a long time Mac world person, world of Mac, rather.
[41:38.560 --> 41:45.120]  It gets to Kevin Kelly's thousand true fans thesis, you know, that if you can build whatever
[41:45.120 --> 41:52.400]  it is you're doing, if you can get a thousand true fans and get them to pay you some reasonable
[41:52.400 --> 41:58.960]  amount, because they just love your work, a thousand fans who just love the thing that you do
[42:00.720 --> 42:03.840]  could be something you could build an artistic life upon.
[42:03.840 --> 42:08.720]  Right. So why not be able to build that on top of Twitter? Why not have Patreon or Kickstarter?
[42:08.720 --> 42:14.240]  Again, not all the features, but there's aspects of it. And Twitter talked about doing like a way
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.480]  you could pay people for tweets, but that's not the right model. Then they bought Revu,
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.120]  that mailing list software, which they're allowing you to use for free now. And I guess it was kind
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.000]  of a competition with tiny letter. It's a little, it's sub stack like in some ways, but it isn't
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.160]  integrated in the sense, like, I feel like, you know, we could, we could pitch business models
[42:32.160 --> 42:37.440]  for Twitter all day and Elan won't listen to us. But, you know, just the fact that you and I can
[42:37.440 --> 42:43.520]  riff for five minutes and come up with business ideas that would make, or function ideas that
[42:43.520 --> 42:47.760]  make perfect sense, don't change Twitter's fundamental nature and would extend it and
[42:47.760 --> 42:52.160]  prove it makes me feel that there is an incredible, and again, given the staff size, the amount of
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.520]  money they spend on development, it feels like there's a dearth of imagination there, or there's
[42:57.520 --> 43:03.040]  a fear of management and maybe it does need a change. And one of the arguments that came out
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.480]  after Musk made his initial vague offer was that maybe another bigger company will come along,
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.320]  not Facebook, but somebody else and buy them and kind of, you know, help the management transition
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.520]  out with golden parachutes and put in people who are really gonna, you know, make this a bigger
[43:19.520 --> 43:26.640]  service that's more useful and less horrible. Yeah, but I think that that's part of the current
[43:26.640 --> 43:32.000]  political moment we're in, where who is that company, right? Like you even backtracked,
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.360]  you even backtracked right there and said, not Facebook, right? Because...
[43:35.360 --> 43:38.480]  Well, I think antitrust, they couldn't do it, but still, I don't want Facebook.
[43:38.480 --> 43:42.720]  Right, but they, yeah, so you could look at it two ways in terms of, oh my God,
[43:42.720 --> 43:50.880]  I don't even want to contemplate the idea, right? As like a human being, but then as a detached
[43:50.880 --> 43:57.040]  observer, there's no way it would pass regulatory muster. Honestly, it probably wouldn't even if
[43:57.040 --> 44:05.920]  Trump were in office, like even a Trump administration might not be able to muster the
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.600]  will to say, sure, sure, Facebook can buy them. The EU would never allow it, you know, they would
[44:11.600 --> 44:16.960]  fight tooth and nail. But then that raises the question, who would it be? Apple? Apple
[44:16.960 --> 44:21.040]  certainly has the money, but definitely is off-brand. There's no, there's no...
[44:23.200 --> 44:26.560]  Apple's working on Ping behind the, come on, Ping's gonna make a comeback.
[44:26.560 --> 44:33.280]  Let me just toss this out there. Maybe, maybe the only reasonable answer is Microsoft,
[44:33.280 --> 44:41.840]  because Microsoft does acquire, seemingly, you know, they bought LinkedIn, which is sort of
[44:41.840 --> 44:48.480]  under the radar in terms of, you know, how wide, how widely it's used, and it's just not, nobody
[44:48.480 --> 44:53.920]  posts controversial stuff on LinkedIn. Did you see the crazy thing Elon Musk posted on LinkedIn? No,
[44:54.560 --> 44:56.480]  nobody has ever said those words before.
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.480]  Jon, I'm going to ask you, here's a pop quiz. How much do you think Microsoft is worth today?
[45:02.480 --> 45:08.000]  And like, order of magnitude? Like, what's their market cap? They gotta be like, what,
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.560]  like close to two trillion? Yeah, good. Wow. I thought they were a trillion dollar company.
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.760]  And I looked the other day, I'm like, Oh my God, they execute. So I think Microsoft is the answer,
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.360]  right? Because nobody else is big enough to absorb Twitter and have infrastructure. And I think
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.640]  Microsoft has not ruined a lot of companies lately. The last numbers of acquisitions it's
[45:28.640 --> 45:32.960]  done have not seemed to been, you know, in the past Microsoft, it felt like they were almost
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.280]  doing it punitively. They would acquire a company within a few years, they would write down the value
[45:37.280 --> 45:41.840]  and nothing would be left of it. Like there was an ad company, it was Avenue something here in,
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.080]  I can't remember the name of it, Avenue A in Seattle. And they bought for $7 billion. They
[45:46.080 --> 45:49.600]  just would buy companies and then they disappear. And now you have things like, I don't know what,
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.640]  like GitHub and LinkedIn and other, they've bought a bunch of stuff that I forget is even owned by
[45:54.640 --> 45:59.840]  Microsoft because it continues to be run in what seems to be an effective and ongoing way.
[45:59.840 --> 46:06.480]  Yeah. And the Blizzard Activision thing makes you think like that they know how to step in
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.040]  when a company is troubled, distressed asset for lack of a better term.
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.720]  Well, an asset in distress, but yeah, no, I think you're right. Cause you know, Amazon, it's not,
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.360]  it is not aligned with Amazon's interest to do it. It's a distraction, but for Microsoft,
[46:21.360 --> 46:25.600]  it could be an extension. It's like, well, we have teams and we have Twitter and we have business
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.360]  Twitter. Now, I mean, a lot of people don't like what Microsoft did with Skype, but I think Skype
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.320]  needed to change also. So, you know, there's somewhere, there's some universe of that,
[46:34.320 --> 46:38.080]  that could work even though, you know, how many would help promote Bing? I'm not sure.
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.640]  There's something weird about Twitter before we leave the topic. There is something weird that I
[46:42.640 --> 46:46.800]  don't think we're going to be able to put our finger on it. Cause I think, I think it's sort
[46:46.800 --> 46:54.560]  of ineffable, but there's something weird about the fact that Twitter is conceptually so simple
[46:54.560 --> 47:01.040]  that you could in theory, you know, like if you, if you got a time traveler from
[47:01.760 --> 47:08.400]  1990 and tried to explain to this person who who's been gone for 30 years, you know,
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.120]  what Twitter is, you could explain it to them fairly quickly in a way that you wouldn't be
[47:13.120 --> 47:18.480]  able to explain Facebook quickly. I mean, even to somebody like me, who's not a time traveler,
[47:18.480 --> 47:24.400]  it's hard to explain what Facebook itself is, right? It's, it's actually very conceptually
[47:24.400 --> 47:29.840]  broad and has dozens and dozens of features, but the idea that you get to make a post,
[47:29.840 --> 47:36.080]  you have an identity and you pick a name and the namespace is controlled by the company.
[47:36.080 --> 47:43.920]  And that's important. So there's only one Glen F there's only one Gruber on Twitter. That's it.
[47:43.920 --> 47:48.960]  And you, you get a box, you can type characters, you get up to 280 characters,
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.840]  and then you hit a button and it goes out as a microblog post, right? You can explain that.
[47:55.840 --> 48:01.280]  It's very hard for me though, to, to really try to understand why
[48:01.280 --> 48:10.480]  Twitter is uniquely successful. And none of the would be Twitter clones have ever gained
[48:10.480 --> 48:17.440]  any traction whatsoever. It's sort of like some kind of forcing function. I don't even know what
[48:17.440 --> 48:26.560]  you call it, where once you get a certain gravity of users, that's it, it's all over and nobody else
[48:26.560 --> 48:34.480]  can possibly compete. Even though as a concept, it's actually one of the easiest things to clone
[48:34.480 --> 48:38.560]  in tech that I've ever seen. Yeah, it's, it's, I mean, I think here's what you tell somebody
[48:38.560 --> 48:45.520]  in the 1980s, you'd say it's a giant BBS, right? And then in the 1990s, it'd be, it's a giant IRC.
[48:45.520 --> 48:49.280]  Right. And everybody's like, oh, and it's like, well, how do you manage it? It's like, well,
[48:49.280 --> 48:52.640]  you can do some filtering and, and yeah, and then blah, blah, blah. They'd be like, oh, okay. All
[48:52.640 --> 48:55.520]  right. There's like a, you know, graph and you don't get it. You don't have to see every message
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.200]  that you don't have to see every message, you know? So that's the entire explanation. Like,
[48:59.200 --> 49:04.000]  you know, and it's kind of like Slack started, Slack was like, you know, it's like a sophisticated
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.720]  IRC also in Twitter's like one step further. I totally agree with you. It just feels like
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.720]  something, something is broken fundamentally and how Twitter
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.320]  envisions what its purpose is. And that gets reflected in code because I don't feel like
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.520]  it's ever reached its potential. And part of that is good in that they've exercised restraint. So
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.000]  they didn't become Facebook. They didn't become a different service. They're true to their origins,
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.400]  a short message service that you post and people can see it. But I think they never,
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.040]  I think they didn't step up to, it took them a long time to believe that trust and safety
[49:37.040 --> 49:43.440]  meant anything beyond keeping, you know, child sexualized the images of, of, you know, so forth.
[49:43.440 --> 49:44.400]  What's that called? CSAM.
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.040]  CSAM, right. It's an abbreviation. It used to be called child pornography.
[49:47.040 --> 49:49.200]  The most obvious stuff that you have, you know.
[49:49.200 --> 49:51.840]  Legal requirement. You have to do something about that.
[49:51.840 --> 49:55.920]  Well, but also common sense, right? Like even if there weren't a legal requirement,
[49:55.920 --> 50:01.120]  even if they were incorporated in some countries, just basic human decency.
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.240]  But they were started at a time when there was no, there wasn't a perception that you had to start
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.360]  with dealing with abuse from day one. And I think that was always naive because anyone who'd run any
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.240]  kind of moderated anything in the past or unfettered anything knows that if you don't
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.480]  deal with abuse from day one, the service becomes unusable. And that's, you know,
[50:20.480 --> 50:24.000]  that's the fear that people have that Musk will do is he'll turn off some of the trust and safety
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.680]  features and, and then it will become very quickly unusable, like old, like Friendster or something.
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.160]  And I, but I, so I don't think Twitter ever figured out that. So, you know, a lot of times they keep
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.280]  on, whenever they announce a new feature and sometimes it's a good one, people will say,
[50:37.280 --> 50:41.680]  that's great. Now do something about the Nazis. And when your service, when your best users,
[50:41.680 --> 50:46.560]  the people are most engaged with it, call the service a hell hole and say, you need to take
[50:46.560 --> 50:50.960]  care of your Nazi problem. It feels like you haven't done your job, even though your job is
[50:50.960 --> 50:56.160]  very hard and it's not, it doesn't just mean you hire 5,000 trust and safety people. It feels like
[50:56.160 --> 51:01.520]  there is, as I go back to the amplification problem, like I feel like Instagram, the reason
[51:01.520 --> 51:06.640]  I stay on Instagram and maybe this is yours as well is Instagram solved the social graph problem
[51:06.640 --> 51:12.320]  for me. So it shows me a reasonable number of things. It's enough to keep me interested. And
[51:12.320 --> 51:17.760]  it's from people I want to see them from. And excuse me, they've been trying to add in certain
[51:17.760 --> 51:22.480]  ways for people to push stuff at you and they put in more ads and so forth. But Instagram remains
[51:22.480 --> 51:28.480]  mostly useful to me for the purpose, which is I want to see pictures of babies, dogs, cats, art,
[51:28.480 --> 51:34.480]  letterpress, and my friends. And so it is great in a way that Facebook is not and in a way that
[51:34.480 --> 51:39.920]  Twitter is not. So, but they had to exercise incredible restraint in Instagram to not try
[51:39.920 --> 51:45.120]  to constantly blow up the social graph and bring in other crap. And even the non-chronological
[51:45.120 --> 51:48.960]  reordering, it's been years and people are really mad about that. And they're apparently going to
[51:48.960 --> 51:54.080]  bring back chronological ordering. So what did Instagram do right that Twitter did wrong? And I
[51:54.080 --> 51:59.200]  think it's Instagram got this, didn't feel they needed to scale for engagement, that they could
[51:59.200 --> 52:03.600]  actually make enough advertising money and have enough features that would keep people coming to
[52:03.600 --> 52:08.240]  use it without having to throw a lot of stuff at people they didn't want to see, especially from
[52:08.240 --> 52:12.480]  people they didn't want to hear from. I kind of feel like you're making a backdoor argument that
[52:12.480 --> 52:17.200]  maybe Facebook should have bought Twitter 15 years ago. Yeah, but then they would have, you know,
[52:17.200 --> 52:21.680]  what they would have done though is they would have, I mean, it's kind of, Facebook is insidious
[52:21.680 --> 52:25.520]  at needing to, I mean, it is, it is weird to me how many changes they've made to Instagram
[52:25.520 --> 52:29.520]  and yet have not ruined it. And I think that is, there's probably been a lot of resistance
[52:30.240 --> 52:35.120]  to keeping it, you know, if the people at Instagram were as wholeheartedly for the same
[52:35.120 --> 52:39.360]  kinds of things, the management of Facebook was, I don't think Instagram would be useful anymore.
[52:40.720 --> 52:44.960]  All right, let's take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at

[54:45.360 --> 54:52.320]  hellofresh.com slash talk show 16, promo code talk show 16, and get started with HelloFresh.
[54:54.160 --> 54:58.320]  Glenn, you wrote a book. Again, again.
[54:59.520 --> 55:02.640]  I've got 10 active books that take control right now.
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.800]  I can't help it. It's a disease. Yeah. So people really hate USB-C, John.
[55:08.800 --> 55:14.960]  I think that's the fundamental thing. And so over at Macworlds, I write the Mac 911 column,
[55:14.960 --> 55:19.600]  and the most popular question I get just about the first one is about photos and why it doesn't
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.240]  work right. Usually something to do with photos. And the second one is often about cables. Like,
[55:24.240 --> 55:29.840]  why can't I plug these two things in or I have this cable and it looks right and I plug it in
[55:29.840 --> 55:35.040]  and either nothing happens or I'm getting, you know, like incredibly low data rates or I have
[55:35.040 --> 55:39.360]  this old monitor and I can't figure out what to plug it in and I don't want to throw away my
[55:39.360 --> 55:44.880]  beautiful Apple Cinema Display. It has a dual DVI connector. Can I plug it into Thunderbolt
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.360]  3 or 4? So I wrote a book. I wrote a book. Take Control of Untangling Connections.
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.120]  And it's basically the answers. It's like the explanation to answers for everything to do with
[55:55.120 --> 56:00.320]  cables and ports. And it's the book that you wish you didn't have to write because it's not,
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.240]  I try not to make it all like technical standards, but it's just, it's a lot of
[56:04.240 --> 56:10.000]  the stuff where things should just work and they do in the right circumstances. When they don't,
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.640]  you're left with almost no information about what to do next.
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.760]  It's sort of like the way that the computer industry has gone. I know you and I have joked
[56:17.760 --> 56:22.320]  about this on, at least on Twitter, but it always comes back to Scuzzy, right?
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.640]  Yeah, we were just, we have a great conversation recently and I found old photos and then John
[56:28.640 --> 56:32.880]  Moltz, friend of the show, friend of your show, John Moltz has an excellent Terminator t-shirt
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.160]  that you can buy that's really beautiful. But yeah, I hadn't thought about it for years. And
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.960]  then I can't remember where it came up. Maybe you were talking about it. I was like, Oh yeah,
[56:38.960 --> 56:43.120]  Scuzzy. And I'm like, Oh yeah, I remember the numbers. You had to put the number in. And
[56:43.120 --> 56:46.960]  then do you remember, I don't, did you use a 2FX? I can't remember.
[56:46.960 --> 56:49.120]  No, I never did.
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.160]  So the 2FX, I think it was Jean-Louis Gasset's brainchild. I have to believe, maybe I'm wrong,
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.800]  but every, I had to run a hundred of them when I was running the tactical side of the
[56:58.800 --> 57:03.280]  Codex Center for Creative Imaging in the early nineties, they had bought a hundred 2FXs because
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.000]  John Scully was involved and it was a whole thing. And so we had a, you know, a building full of them
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.200]  to teach classes and the 2FX, everything was different. It had different parody memory. It
[57:13.200 --> 57:16.960]  had different, gosh, a different card, the card slot standards were the same. There was something
[57:16.960 --> 57:22.160]  to do with that, but it was more powerful, but it also had a variant Scuzzy version.
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.280]  So you had to use, you'll remember this, there was a gray Scuzzy Terminator for regular backs.
[57:27.280 --> 57:33.120]  Oh no. A black Scuzzy Terminator for 2FXs. And if you didn't put the black one on the end,
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.960]  or have a compatible chain, it just wouldn't terminate correctly. So yeah, I mean, it's,
[57:36.960 --> 57:39.680]  you know, this stuff isn't new, but that was particularly hilarious.
[57:39.680 --> 57:45.680]  For those who don't, for those who are too young or just have faulty memories, the 2FX,
[57:45.680 --> 57:48.160]  I think came out in 1989, maybe 1990.
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.000]  That sounds right. Very close, yeah.
[57:50.000 --> 57:57.680]  But it was Apple's foray into the, what we used to call workstations, where it was, it was not
[57:57.680 --> 58:04.800]  consumer priced at all. I think in like today's dollars, 2FX was like $20,000 or more than 20.
[58:04.800 --> 58:14.080]  I think we paid really without memory, like $6,000 in 1991 each, something like that. So yeah,
[58:14.080 --> 58:16.240]  without the memory and without drive storage.
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.160]  Right. It was a veritable fortune. And, you know, there was a market for stuff like that. And
[58:22.160 --> 58:27.760]  in hindsight, it makes sense because you look at how fast an actual 2FX was by today's standards,
[58:27.760 --> 58:34.240]  and it's, you know, less powerful than your watch as a computer. And you could see, well, yeah,
[58:34.240 --> 58:40.000]  so obviously somebody needed all that power, right? Like you'd be using a 2FX and you'd run
[58:40.000 --> 58:47.040]  like a Gaussian blur in Photoshop, and you'd be like, this is amazing. It only took a minute.
[58:47.040 --> 58:51.120]  Yeah. Well, it was like the difference if 2FX versus like some of the previous
[58:51.120 --> 58:55.600]  Macintosh 2 models had the same kind of effect of like the M1 versus the previous Intel.
[58:55.600 --> 58:56.000]  Right.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.480]  And so, you know, you'd be like, holy cow, can that really be that fast? And the M1 is
[59:01.360 --> 59:05.520]  ridiculous. But in those days, you would have exactly the thing, well, this took five minutes.
[59:05.520 --> 59:10.400]  Oh, I ran it on the 2FX. I had my graphics accelerator card in or whatever, a coprocessor
[59:10.400 --> 59:14.560]  card, and one of the six cards allowed, something like that. And it was one minute,
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.480]  and you'd be like, this is going to shave days off my year of work.
[59:18.480 --> 59:23.760]  But basically the way I think that the industry has gone in broad strokes is that in the old days,
[59:23.760 --> 59:29.840]  in the 80s, when the PC era was new, there were all sorts of different ports on the back of
[59:29.840 --> 59:35.600]  whether you had a Mac or a PC, all sorts of different ports. And if if a cable plugged
[59:35.600 --> 59:43.760]  into the port, it probably was fine, right? Like, that's really good. And that is sort of why we
[59:43.760 --> 59:52.000]  remember SCSI. Because SCSI wasn't like that. It's like, well, no, it's you'd still need you'd need
[59:52.000 --> 59:56.560]  like a terminator, because the idea with SCSI for people, again, people don't remember, but you
[59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.920]  could, you'd have one SCSI port on the back of your Mac, and then you could plug a SCSI device
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.560]  into it. But then you could also daisy chain another device and plug that into, you know,
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.720]  like, so if you had like two hard drives, you could plug hard drive A into your Mac and plug
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.160]  hard drive B into hard drive A. And if it all worked, it was, you know, you didn't lose
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.680]  performance. It was just as fast as if they were plugged in directly, but you could. But then at
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.960]  the end of the chain, you had to have a terminator. Unless you had a fancy, later there were those
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.520]  fancy devices that could self terminate. Yep, I remember that. That was so that was so exciting.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.120]  You have to find your terminator. Yeah. And then, you know, then you take then you got to the
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.480]  compatibility issue is I think SCSI, I want to say SCSI one was that standard connector, but
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.960]  then SCSI two, SCSI three was really different. It was smaller. Yeah, it was kind of vicious and
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.600]  had these really sharp little points on it. And the cables were really expensive. But yeah,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.040]  there would be like, I think there are probably seven different ports on the back of the Mac,
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:06.240]  you'd have like ADB, and you'd have serial for local talk, eventually SCSI, which looked a lot
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.200]  like ADB, serial and ADB kind of look the same. And you'd have to like kind of double check the
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.280]  cable. Oh, you didn't break the pins. If you pushed in, you might bend some pins in the
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.080]  round cable. Yeah. And so I mean, that's, it was funny. I was I thought in the book, I was like,
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.320]  I'll go back 20 years, because people have generations of equipment. And I'll say what
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.880]  are the major standards. And what's interesting is, excuse me, what's interesting is that that
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:36.800]  by, if you go back to say, 2001, 2002, you really have USB, and then FireWire, and then Thunderbolt,
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.240]  and then Thunderbolt totally, you know, it's almost erases FireWire fairly quickly. But it's,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.640]  I didn't realize that it went back that far. I was thinking we had a lot of different standards
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.280]  still in play. And on the PC side, there were definitely more, but even a DisplayPort,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.640]  and HDMI start to emerge in the, you know, less than 20 years ago, but not by much. So all of our
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.160]  modern standards, as much as we may feel like there are too many definitely have long roots,
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.240]  and a lot of it's still compatible. So you can, you know, when I when the first USB-C equipped
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.480]  Mac, the 2015 12 inch MacBook, which was the only one that lacked Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.280]  3 came out the next year with the new MacBook Pros, but the I owned a 12 inch MacBook,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.640]  I really liked it, actually, it's the one with the first one with the keyboard everyone hated,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.760]  and I know mine always worked, and I kind of liked it, but it only did USB 3 over USB-C,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:34.080]  but it could do DisplayPort, alt mode, and some other things. And that model, you know,
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.360]  you would be searching like crazy to find adapters, because it was, you know, companies in China were
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.160]  making them, there were a few major firms making them. And I get email from people saying I have,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:49.120]  you know, an example, I have a dual DVI display that works perfectly fine, and I'd like to plug
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:54.000]  it into this, can I? And then readers would say, Oh, I figured a way to do it. I got a
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.000]  dual DVI adapter that goes into DisplayPort, and then a DisplayPort this into that, and then a
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.560]  DisplayPort Mini to USB-C, and they'd have three or sometimes I think four cables, and they could
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.720]  run their monitor. And I thought, what a testament to the tunneling capability of DisplayPort,
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.840]  which is amazing. It was going, I got to say, I thought one case literally was four adapters,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.040]  and it would pass through and work fine. No flickers, no weirdness. Maybe they had to
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.440]  plug it in after booting their Mac or something, and that was it.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.520]  So at this point, as a user, you're effectively writing a little miniature computer program
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.760]  using hardware dongles.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.560]  Oh, that is great. Yeah, that's exactly it. It's like those old, I mean, you can buy those today,
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.520]  those electronics kits that you fit pieces together to make a circuit.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  It's like, if you plug this into that, and you buy this one adapter that only this one company
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.880]  makes, but they're a great company that's been around forever, and you buy this thing,
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.840]  and then you plug that into that, then you can plug it in, and you can use your old display.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.320]  And yeah, and most of the displays that are still functioning and worth using use Mini DisplayLink,
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.360]  I'm sorry, Mini DisplayPort, or which there are many adapters now, so that's good. And
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.480]  there's docks that have Mini DisplayPort. Those have seemingly faded out, the Thunderbolt 3 docks,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.120]  Mini DisplayPort, and USB 3-only USB-C docks, because there's just, you know,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.120]  no one's making Mini DisplayPort-based monitors anymore that have special ones with hard-wired
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.720]  cables like Apple did. But you could get, you know, you can get docks and plug those in and
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.400]  do it directly instead of having to use the three adapters. But that was kind of the generation that
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.440]  remained, and then everything newer, if you've got a DisplayPort, like a regular full-size DisplayPort
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:43.600]  or HDMI port on the back of your monitor, then you can plug it in either directly or with an adapter,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.960]  and that just became easy. I mean, I think the real reason, there's actually this big issue,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.400]  which I found in researching the book, is that DisplayPort is up to 2.1, version 2.1,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:59.120]  but USB-C and Thunderbolt both incorporate, or USB, I should say, yeah, USB-C as a standard,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:05.040]  even though it's a connector, it incorporates alt modes that include one for HDMI and DisplayPort,
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.240]  and then Thunderbolt 3 and 4 also include that as kind of an alt mode that you can run this,
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.760]  or I think it's more of a standard part of the spec, not as an alt mode. Anyway, when you're
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:22.000]  using an adapter for a device that doesn't have direct support, like the new from last year,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.400]  MacBook Pros with HDMI connectors built in, or a Mac Mini with the latest of those,
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.720]  when you're using an adapter for USB-C, then the latest standard it can use is DisplayPort,
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:36.640]  I think it's either 1.4 or 1.4A, and that limits maximum display size. So it supports 4K,
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:42.800]  and Apple's done some interesting tricks, so you can get up to 6K over USB-C or Thunderbolt,
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:48.080]  but that is a big limitation, because those standards, the Thunderbolt 4 is out and USB 4
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.120]  is out, and USB-C is kind of, you know, it's constantly evolving, but standard with very
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:59.920]  minor changes, and those don't offer direct 8K support, which some people want. So that
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.320]  becomes an issue of, do you buy a video card, there's not that many 8K displays out yet,
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.600]  how many people want an 8K display, but it's a limiting factor because of kind of this mismatch
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  in embedded display standards in our most popular communications formats.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:23.200]  It's sort of like complaining, isn't it sort of like complaining that, ah, politicians, I hate
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:30.880]  them, right? I hate Congress. Like, it's sort of always been that way, right? That's one thing
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:38.800]  about being in middle age now, where I've gained some wisdom, and it's like, oh, it wasn't like
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.560]  a new thing, like everybody acts like it's a new thing, and you hate today's Congress in unique
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.280]  ways because of today's Congress, and the reason you're not going to like Congress 15 years from
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:54.000]  now will be entirely different. It might be a different party in control, there'll be different
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.360]  issues of the day, different personalities, but it's like, fundamentally, politics is hard
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:06.160]  and ugly, and there's no way around it, and it's, you know, famously, democracy is the worst system
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.040]  of government except for all the other ones that have been tried. And that's sort of like when
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:19.120]  you're connecting devices from one to another. It always sucked. It always has sucked. Today is not
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:28.800]  uniquely sucky, and there are all sorts of nice things about the USBC port world that are better
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.080]  than the old days. You'd certainly, you know, certainly the fact that you just plug things in,
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:38.240]  you don't have to screw clamps in and stuff like that, and there's no pins to be bent, you know,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.080]  it, ports have gotten better. But I'll just tell you, like, I just remember the one real eye opener,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.160]  and it was only, I don't know, like two or three years ago, but it was probably like at the tail
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:54.720]  end of the Intel Mac era, and I got, Apple came out with a new MacBook, whatever, and I got one
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:02.560]  to review, and I was like, well, let me set this one up as a clone of my daily use MacBook Pro,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.880]  so that I'll have all my software on it, and I thought I hooked it up correctly and ran
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.600]  migration assistant, and everything was plugged into power, and I was like, I'll just let this
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.280]  go for a bit, and came back like two hours later, and it was like 1% finished. I was like,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.920]  and I was like, what? This is bananas. What's going on? And it was because I used the wrong cable.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.680]  Yeah, yeah. I'll say, I don't know if Apple added this, but I was helping my wife migrate from a
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:35.200]  2014, I'm losing track, 2018 MacBook Pro that she'd bought after her previous computer died
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.880]  abruptly, so it was just before the M1s were out she wanted, so she, within a year with a 16-inch,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.720]  she has a little bit of low vision, so when the 16-inch MacBook Pro came out, she's like,
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.720]  she's the early rejecter in the household, I'm the early adopter, she's like, I don't need that,
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:52.000]  we'll get that later, no, don't install that, and she's always right, I'm sure.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.040]  But she likes the 16 because she can make everything bigger.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.440]  It makes everything bigger, and it's an incredible machine, so when it came out,
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.040]  she said, get me that, I want that now, and I said, done, I'm going to buy, you know,
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.680]  so my, she and my 14-year-old, or 15-year-old now, has a 14-inch MacBook Pro. I have the
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.400]  oldest technology in the house, you know how embarrassing that is?
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.280]  Yeah, yep, yep.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.320]  Yeah, so they let me look at them occasionally. So I was migrating my wife's machine, so from
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.720]  an Intel model a few years old, I think we'd already upgraded it to Monterey, to her new
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.600]  computer, or maybe it hadn't been updated, anyway, so migration system comes up, and I carefully,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.480]  because I've learned this lesson like you have, I find a Thunderbolt 3 cable I have, I'm like,
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.920]  all right, so it's three on both ends, there's lightning bolts, it's from, I don't know,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.960]  other worlds computing, or some, Belkin, or somebody I trust.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.000]  It feels, it feels slightly too thick, like.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.080]  Yeah, yeah, the head ends are maybe too long, because it might be, it's an active cable,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.920]  I don't know, so I plugged the two in, and I don't remember seeing this in migration
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:52.240]  assistant before, maybe it was a more info button, and I clicked it, and I took a screen
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.920]  caption of, used it in articles since, and it's like, here are your three things we've
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:59.920]  tested, and it was like, Wi-Fi, I was at a Bluetooth, I don't know what the third one
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.920]  was, like this method, or Ethernet, you can get, you know, one megabyte per second, or
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.280]  whatever units it was using, Wi-Fi, you can get three, it's like, you're connected by
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.360]  Thunderbolt, it's like a hundred, I was like, oh, okay, I'll just, I'll use the one, so
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.920]  I think it literally took, whatever the data rate was, I think it took like 35 minutes
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.360]  to transfer 300 gigabytes.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.480]  Which is crazy.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.040]  Yeah, and I was like, well, this is, but it told me, so it would have taken 10 times as
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:27.680]  long, and the second best method, and I thought maybe they should expose that, and actually
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.600]  walking through it, it was kind of like, you should probably use, I think they more strongly
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.000]  emphasized, like connect your computer to another computer with the appropriate cable
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.400]  for best performance or something, but they don't, you know, that's the frustrating
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.560]  part, I got email from someone to the Macworld address last year sometime, who said, look,
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.120]  I'm sitting here with a pile of cables, and they're all USB-C, and I don't know which
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.680]  did which, and you know, when you buy a cable, do you buy it and then get out your, I don't
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.520]  know, your marking pen, or your label, like, some people do, I think Adam Inks is now
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.200]  flagging his cables because it became too ridiculous, and I should be, but you look
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.200]  at the cable ends, and you're thinking, well, I live in a modern, sane world, the cable
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:09.920]  ends will tell me what's going on, and I have Thunderbolt 3 cables that are totally
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.080]  unmarked, they only have the manufacturer's name stamped into them, and John, I have this,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.400]  I have this, like, it's not a Letterman thing, but it's like the top three worst USB-C,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.760]  like the most untrustworthy USB-C cables, which is, so here, the worst I think is Apple's
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:36.400]  USB-C charging cable. You've encountered this, right? So it only passes data at USB-2 speeds,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.440]  it does not do Thunderbolt, it does not do USB-3, it's a 480 megabit per second cable,
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.560]  but it has up to 100 watts worth of charging capability.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.080]  But it's super thin.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:51.280]  It's super thin, yeah, it's super thin, because it doesn't have, I don't think they
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.200]  had to leave out wires, but I think the spec they're able to use, so that's the one
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.640]  that shipped with the 12-inch MacBook that I had in 2015, Apple still ships with some
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.960]  models, they're gradually shifting to a Thunderbolt 4 USB-4 style cable, though, so the
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:13.440]  modern ones, if you get one that doesn't have MagSafe 3 to USB-C, I believe it has most
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.240]  of the, most models, I think the other MacBook Pro has a better cable, so that's one,
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.840]  and it's almost unidentifiable, because the ends are typically, I don't think Apple
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.800]  marks the ends on it.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.120]  Of course.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.960]  The second is the US, if you have a Thunderbolt 3 cable, that's an active cable, so it has
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.960]  this big plug-ins, it has extra circuitry to go over about a half a meter, or what is
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.120]  it, like 20 inches or something, if you have a long, active Thunderbolt 3 cable, if you
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.120]  plug it in on one end or both ends to a USB-3 only device or controller, it only passes
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.360]  data at USB-2 speeds, and so I get, I hear people all the time, like, I plugged in my
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.160]  cable, and I'm not getting, you know, five gigabits per second, or 20, or 10, or whatever
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.360]  they expect from it, and I'm like, look at the cable carefully, you know, is there a
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.800]  three, or is there a lightning bolt and it's unmarked, and that's almost always the thing,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.440]  it's an active Thunderbolt 3 cable, and I think it was three or four years ago, Mac
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.600]  Rumors or somebody, 9to5Mac, wrote a piece about it, saying that they had discovered
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.800]  this problem, and it's in the spec, sort of, like, it's not illegitimate, but it's
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.040]  incredibly frustrating, and you could wind up with all these cables around like that,
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:21.840]  so, I don't know.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.880]  We've documented, we've documented it, so it's not a bug.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.240]  Yeah, it's not, exactly, it's you have to know that you have the right cable, and
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.760]  there's one other, since I've more, I've written about this, there's one other, which
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:42.800]  is, there's a cable that it's USB, it's USB 3.1 or 3.2 only, so if you plug it between,
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.240]  so it has USB-C connectors on both ends, but if you plug it between two Thunderbolt
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.960]  devices, you don't get 40 gigabits per second, you only get 10 or 5, the other thing is,
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.640]  if you're in that scenario, so the cable you might have used, it might have been a
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:03.680]  USB 3 only cable, I think that's, you plug it between two, yeah, if you plug it between
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:10.080]  two Macs, it won't connect at all, because Thunderbolt has a special peer-to-peer mode
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.400]  that allows 10 gigabit per second communication, I didn't even know about this before researching
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.120]  the book, it's a specific mode, and you can daisy chain it, so you can plug Mac into Mac
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:26.080]  into Mac, using your, if you have free Thunderbolt ports on it, so a USB 3 only cable will not
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.960]  be able to invoke that mode, because the Thunderbolt devices can't handshake over it,
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.160]  so you're like, you can have any of these three cables, and some of them might be marked
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:40.480]  like the USB 3 only one might have USB-C symbols, or USB symbols on the ends, but the others
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.600]  might have nothing or a lightning bolt, and you're expected to sort it out, and I think
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.000]  those three wind up being the ones that people encounter, you know, a lot, those are the
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.040]  ones I hear about the most.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.080]  I have one of those is what I ran into, for sure, and I guess it raises a philosophical
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:05.760]  question, which is, is it better that it will still fall back to a 20 times slower speed,
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:09.440]  right, like, I think like 10 gigabit compared to 480?
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:15.920]  480 megabit is about a factor of 20, and you really could, you know, like that's not like
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.960]  theoretical, like you really would get 20 times the speed if you had the right cable.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.200]  Is it better that it falls back to 120th the speed, or would it be better if it didn't
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.000]  work at all?
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.080]  Like, in my case, when I was trying to transfer the old Mac to a new Mac to review it, it
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.720]  would have been better if it had just barked at me right away, and just said, hey, this
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.000]  is not the right cable.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.480]  You know, you should actually, if you need to, you should actually go to the Apple store
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:50.000]  and spend 100 bucks on a new cable, because it would be well worth it if you don't, if
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.760]  you can't find it in your jumble of cables, you should just go buy one.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.280]  It's that much slower.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.000]  I wish I would have gotten the notice, because I had to wait.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.480]  It was like, oh, sure, this will work, and we'll give an estimate, and the initial
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.320]  estimate, I never trust it, right?
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.560]  Those estimates are, they always, you know, if like, when I, you know, sanity checked
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.840]  by just looking at the screen and saw that the migration assistant was proceeding, and
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.080]  it was like, oh, this is going to take two days.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.320]  I was like, oh, I'm sure it'll catch up soon, you know, and no, literally, it meant
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.440]  it was going to take two days.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.160]  It's, this is a complaint people have.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.440]  I got a lot of, I wrote a piece last year for Tidbits called US Befuddled, which I know
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:35.040]  you link to, and got a lot, we got a lot of comments and feedback on a lot of good insight
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.360]  from people who are a little more technical than I am, who, who gave me some nuance about
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.400]  a few of the issues to do with like power over USB-C and some of the standards issues.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.360]  So I feel like I developed a better understanding of some of the stuff that doesn't work and
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.600]  why, but the, one of the things that came out of that is everybody felt like they're,
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.960]  they felt like everybody was asking, why can't you just get a cable tester?
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.800]  And you could, they're expensive and they're used in the industry, but you know, when you
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.280]  plug in both ends into something that says this, you know, does this kind of e-tagging
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.640]  and this kind of whatever, and it's a, it can run at these standards, but really there's
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.440]  a problem.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.960]  Like there's a, you know, you can plug it into a Mac and into another device and then
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.720]  use system information and it will tell you what connection was negotiated, but it won't
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.640]  tell you what connection it can't negotiate.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.160]  So in your case, it can't say, Hey, I can't negotiate.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.560]  Or what it could do, what Apple could do though, I think is it could offer you an interesting
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.640]  pop-up and maybe you'd be able to disable it.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.680]  When you plugged in to any USB-C port, if you plugged into a peripheral that wasn't
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:42.800]  a, a keyboard or a scanner or something that doesn't need, I weirdly, I have my first
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.840]  scanner that I've owned in like 20 years because we live in the future.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.280]  I need a flatbed scanner again.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.600]  And so if you had something that didn't require a gigabits per second and Apple could
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.120]  recognize that it could even have, you know, there's, there's tags that come across even
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.320]  with older equipment and say, Hey, this connection is only operating at USB 2.0 or 480
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.280]  megabits per second.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.240]  The device is capable.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.920]  It's likely capable of faster rates.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:09.200]  You may need a Thunderbolt three or four cable or USB four cable or whatever it wants to
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.600]  say to obtain the fastest speed.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.400]  Okay.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.000]  And I don't think that would be unwelcome because it's very rare that you want a four,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.640]  you know, if you plug in USB 2.0 or you're only getting USB 2.0 speeds, what are the
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.320]  circumstances in which you want that?
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.520]  It's, it's really going to be input devices, like limited input devices.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.880]  Yeah. And Apple's made this worse a little bit.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.680]  I guess with USB-C connectors, they're too small.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.320]  You can't see it, but like when the USB-A connector was the, the female port of, of
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:48.160]  choice on PCs, USB-C or USB three went to these blue ones, you know, they'd use blue
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.800]  plastic and it was like, okay, this is how you can tell which of your ports is a USB
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.320]  three if it's blue.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.040]  And then you could use a faster peripheral and blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.720]  And Apple of course did not go along with that because they don't want blue.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.360]  You know, it's, it was too ugly.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.960]  But the industry gave up on it, by the way.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.240]  I don't blame Apple for this.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.360]  I, you know, I, I'm sympathetic to their point of view that they don't want to, you
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:19.280]  know, the, the, the sanctity of the design actually is worth that much, but it only made
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.400]  things more confusing.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.280]  Yeah.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:21.920]  It's yeah.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.520]  I mean, color coding would be great in a certain way, but it's also like, you almost
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.040]  want a light, you almost want a little LED on the cable.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.960]  And you could do that with, I mean, you're saying that the two effects, like our watch
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.000]  is more powerful now.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.560]  I think some cable ends on Thunderbolt might be more powerful than computers from the 1990s
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.520]  because some of them have to have, I mean, the active Thunderbolt cables particularly
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.680]  have to have a lot of little signaling stuff in there and they could conceivably light
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:51.280]  up with an LED that indicates, you know, it could be yellow for 480 or whatever they want.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.640]  There could be a little bit of a light and a little multi-color LED or a couple elements.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.640]  And that would be incredible.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.960]  I would guess that most people don't need that.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:06.400]  And, you know, really where this comes into play is if you're attaching an SSD and you're,
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.000]  you know, you're sort of figuring out how to get the best performance.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.760]  And like recently I actually, I had an iMac that died last year, unfortunately, it's
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.920]  suddenly and was out of warranty.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.680]  And the motherboard replacement was going to be $800 for a 2017 iMac.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:19.840]  Right.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.480]  I said, no, thank you.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.080]  And this is with an independent repair spot.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.160]  They're like, no one's selling used that board.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.840]  So I'm like, I'll get my, I'll get an M1 Mac Mini.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.440]  And I had already transitioned to using an external one terabyte, it was an NVMe style
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.640]  Thunderbolt 3 enclosure SSD.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.320]  And so that had dramatically improved my iMac from its Fusion drive.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.120]  And I was able to move that over to the Mac, the M1 Mac Mini with some effort because the
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.920]  block for the drive formatting, the file system changes between the M1 and the Intel issues.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.720]  But that worked great.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.240]  And now that's what I use my Mac Mini.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.160]  I bought a 250 gigabyte drive for the Mac Mini.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.960]  I got the cheapest 16 gigabyte Mac Mini.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.560]  Cause I'm like, I already have a terabyte drive, but I had, didn't, it doesn't store
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.440]  my photos library.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:08.160]  So several months ago I thought, you know, I'll get a SATA based SSD.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.920]  They don't run super fast.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.880]  It only has a USB 3 interface, but I don't need a, you know, I don't know, what is it?
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.080]  Two, 3000 megabits per second.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.840]  Or for my, forgetting the number, I think it's like three or three gigabytes per second
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:27.120]  data transfer for my photos library, like 500 megabytes per second is fine.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.040]  And it costs a third as much.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.280]  So, you know, I was doing that interface arbitrage.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.600]  I was like, Oh, I can get an SSD that's a terabyte, but I don't have to spend another,
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.880]  you know, X hundreds of dollars.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.800]  I'll spend a hundred something dollars.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.080]  And it was great, but it had that whole, I had like our, which cable do I have enough
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:42.480]  ports?
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:49.840]  I've got an OWC thunderbolt three slash four hub so I can plug in more, you know, like
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.960]  I've got so many things.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.120]  I've got a USB two hub over on one side with 10 things plugged into it.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.240]  It's kind of a spaghetti here.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.440]  This is why you wrote the book.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.720]  I wrote the book.
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:21:59.600]  I wrote the book pain point.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.920]  What take control, take control of untangling connections.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:10.720]  It is a take control books.com slash untangling guaranteed a hundred percent guaranteed.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.080]  It will be in the show notes.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:16.560]  So you'll you're a tap away, but I'm telling you, if you're listening to this and you're
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.840]  like, yeah, this is confusing.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.800]  I don't even understand.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.840]  I forget half the stuff they've mentioned in the last 20 minutes.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.400]  Get the book.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.800]  It's a people really.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.040]  Yeah.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.400]  It's you know, my goal in life, I don't, I can't cure cancer.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.480]  I cannot prevent war, but I can write how to books that I hope prevent some frustration.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:34.960]  That's my goal.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.920]  You can explain things.
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.760]  Let me take one final break here and thank our third sponsor.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.960]  I love this company.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.240]  I, my whole business is runs on Linode.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:51.600]  You can go to linode.com slash the talk show and see for yourself why Linode has been voted
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.920]  the top infrastructure as a service provider by both G2 and trust radius.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.960]  They, they're, they're award-winning support, which is offered 24 hours a day, seven days
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.680]  a week, 365 days a year.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.320]  You need support on Easter Sunday.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.120]  You could get it.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.040]  You'd need it on July 4th.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.080]  You can get it.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.360]  Maybe you should take the, take the day off, but you know, something goes wrong.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:21.040]  You know, somebody's on call, but you can always get help from Linode and the ease of
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:28.480]  use set up everything from going through their interface to get stuff set up as easy as possible.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.840]  Just click, click, click, or you want to set everything else, set everything up from source
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.040]  code and compile stuff.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.320]  You can do it that way too.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.360]  Whatever, however technical you want to be, you could do it.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:46.560]  They have the best price to performance value for all compute and instances, including GPUs,
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.160]  block storage, Kubernetes, their bare, bare metal release.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.600]  It's all great.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:57.360]  They make cloud computing fast, simple, and affordable, allowing you to focus on your
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.560]  projects, not on your infrastructure.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.760]  Visit linode.com slash the talk show.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:12.160]  You can create a free account using your Google or GitHub user IDs, or just sign up using
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.120]  your email address.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.240]  If that's what you want to do.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:19.200]  And by visiting that address linode.com slash the talk show, you get a hundred bucks in
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.400]  credit, a hundred bucks.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.800]  My thanks to Linode for sponsoring the show and for hosting during Fireball.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.680]  Can I pipe in on Linode for just one second?
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.000]  Yeah, they host everything.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.120]  All my servers are on Linode.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:36.000]  They've saved me vast amounts of money and they've been so reliable, such good communicators.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.880]  I would like to thank them, even though I, you know, they're not a sponsor of me personally.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.520]  I think they're great.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.400]  They've been invaluable.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.840]  If you can, as long as you're saying good things about them, you can pipe right in.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.480]  They're really great.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.720]  Home stretch.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.600]  I don't want to spend a lot of time on this because I feel like it could be a whole show
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.320]  into itself.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:57.120]  But last week, Tim Cook gave a speech to, I think he was in Washington, DC, and it was
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.720]  more or less an anti side loading speech.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.960]  And not just this is why we don't have side loading on iOS, but sort of let's face it.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:11.520]  I mean, he's addressing it, you know, that there are regulatory rumblings in the US and
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:20.640]  the EU that are heading towards mandating side loading in some form for iOS.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.200]  And it's clearly all about iOS because Android already has it.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.760]  It's mobile phones that people are talking about.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.520]  I mean, the PC platforms of Mac and Windows and certainly Linux, you can install anything
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.320]  you want.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:44.160]  And what struck me is is a sort of little boy who cried wolf effect of the response
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.680]  to Cook's speech.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.040]  I saw a couple of comments, but here's one Sam Biddle, who's currently at the intercept.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.440]  He's I think he used to be a gizmodo for years.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.840]  He tweeted, just read his tweet.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.400]  I too, a link to Tim Cook's speech or like an article about his speech and his whole
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.840]  tweet said, I, too, believe that anything that will cost me money is a dire national
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.720]  security threat.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:16.080]  Right, because, you know, because part of part of the side loading argument is, you
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:23.440]  know, if if users are able to install software from anyone, they some users will do it and
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.040]  some of that software will be written for nefarious purposes.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.920]  And again, I don't want to argue about the merits of whether iOS should allow sideloading
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.960]  voluntarily, sort of like Android, where you, you know, go through a couple of serious,
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:41.840]  you know, like or like the way that you have to do it on Mac to boot without safe mode
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:45.040]  on so that you can do things, something like that.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.280]  But I even you can still invoke I mean, I know this is this is becoming increasingly
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:54.160]  hidden feature, but the the gatekeeper feature in Mac OS, which, by the way, I love Apple
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.920]  has never labeled it gatekeeper.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.360]  It discusses it by certain terms in its documentation.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.080]  If you go to look for that feature in Mac OS, it doesn't exist.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.000]  But in the privacy and security preference pane, you know, there's the option only
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.040]  load only install apps from the Mac App Store or the App Store or allow apps from, you
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.160]  know, certified or whatever developers.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.760]  And they used to have a third option was allow any app to allow unsold, unsigned or whatever
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.320]  apps.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.800]  And they removed the third option.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.880]  But you can still right click an app in the finder, select open.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.400]  It's the only way that it will prompt you.
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.440]  And I think you get, I was documenting this for another take control book.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.120]  I think you get an extra prompt now.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.960]  I think there's two prompts to run unsigned software.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.240]  And there's still some software I use that's unsigned, which is ridiculous.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.800]  But, you know, I do I try to vet it and make sure signatures haven't changed and so forth.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.280]  I mean, ridiculous that it feels like there's some developers who are they don't even want
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:53.120]  to spend $100 a year, which they could easily raise even for free software.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:53.920]  Someone would pay for it.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.040]  They don't have to pay for it, or they're already raising money for development.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.600]  And I feel like the trustworthy trustworthiness angle there should be important enough to
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:01.920]  do it.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.000]  But so you have those three options right in the Mac and the Mac App Store or other
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.560]  apps and it you know, that's a user selected choice slightly hidden.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.060]  Yeah.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.520]  If you I'm going to backtrack a little if you search for Gatekeeper in system preferences,
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.600]  it does highlight the security.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.800]  Oh, it doesn't.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.640]  Yeah, it doesn't name that.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.960]  No, but it's somebody tagged it, you know, with the keyword.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.440]  But it's also it's like X protect, which does not exist, except in Apple's documentation.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.400]  You can't do anything with it.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.440]  So they don't mention it anyway.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.800]  But it's a good piece of technology.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:41.920]  But I, I think, long story short, I think that what Apple is saying, if you and I think
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.600]  this is one of those cases where you can take their, they're sort of the opposite of Elon
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:54.960]  Musk, where what they say you can take them at their word, they are fighting mandatory
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.320]  sideloading tooth and nail with with all of their rhetorical vigor.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.640]  You know, they sent Craig Federighi over to I think it was Portugal a couple months ago.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.040]  And now Tim Cook is in Washington, DC.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:15.680]  They're their most senior executives are talking about this in straightforward terms.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:23.680]  They're not fighting regulatory changes on App Store pricing as hard.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:28.960]  Obviously, they would like to just be they would like to just leave things the way they
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:35.920]  are, where it's there's no laws in place that say, you know, if 30% of the App Store
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.240]  fees go to the platform owner, you know, there's there's no laws saying that that's
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:40.640]  illegal.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.960]  And they would like to keep that in place.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:46.880]  And I think they very much enjoyed the money they make from it.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.240]  It is it has grown to a significant sum of money over the life of the App Store.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:58.800]  And whenever it comes to money, you know, it's it's there's a you know, it's duh, it's
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:29:59.760]  about the money, right?
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.520]  The money argument is about the money.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:08.080]  But I feel like what they're running into is they feel much stronger.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:15.200]  They would like to have the control that the App Store brings them, even if a law were
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:23.920]  passed at the snap of a finger to say, all App Store revenue from anything vaguely resembling
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.000]  an App Store worldwide is taxed at 100%.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.760]  So if you charge 30%, the government takes the 30%.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.280]  If you drop the fee to 8020, they'll take the 20.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.920]  And you keep so you cannot profit from App Stores just just just for the sake of argument.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.640]  Sure, sure.
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:47.360]  I think Apple would still be fighting sideloading it with the exact same vim and vigor that
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.840]  they are because they they want that control.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.000]  It's not just about the money.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.400]  But because because the money is there, and most people and most companies, it would be
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:03.120]  about the money that there's a sort of a natural cynicism.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:10.080]  But I think it's incorrect that Apple is only fighting sideloading regulations because
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:10.880]  of the money.
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.640]  And I think that that that they have no one to blame but themselves.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.920]  I am in full agreement with you.
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.640]  I think you have to tease apart Apple's motivations.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.960]  But I, I think that's exactly right.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.280]  I think if money were an issue, they would still be fighting this on principle.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.720]  But money is an issue.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:33.840]  And they it is so you could say 100% of the reason is privacy and security.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.680]  But also 30% of the reason, let's make it 130% just make it turn up to 11 is is there's
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:40.720]  a money aspect to it.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:46.240]  Because if I think if Apple hadn't fought so hard for its 30%, and if it hadn't played,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:50.160]  I don't want to say so many games if it hadn't been, you know, so rigid.
[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.960]  And at some point, they could have said, you know, 30%, it turns out, we can run this efficiently
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.240]  and make a good business for everybody.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.200]  And we've learned so much.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.560]  And now it's 22%.
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.400]  And if you've been a developer, you know, below this level, and you blah, blah, blah,
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.080]  it's going to be 13% or something.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:08.240]  I mean, if they'd done that three years ago, I think they would have avoided a world of
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.880]  pain, and it would have cost them some money.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:15.520]  But I think it also would have produced more developer interest, because we know there
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.880]  are developers who don't like the deal, and they, you know, don't put as much effort in,
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.280]  or they take their apps out of the App Store, and they reserve the income, even if it means
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.320]  a potentially lower income for themselves, that 30% is a big hit.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.120]  And there's plenty of developers who now qualify for the, what's it, $1 million or less annual,
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.120]  who are benefiting from that at the lower rate, although there's a lot of complexities
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:37.840]  about that.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.560]  But I think if Apple hadn't taken a hard line on that, and just pushed back so hard, if
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.800]  it had been doing a better job in app review, if it had been listening to developers better
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.400]  for many years, and really not been doing this arbitrary stuff, I mean, we saw the latest
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.920]  one just came out this last few days, where if your app is more than a couple years old
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.800]  and hasn't been updated, Apple has sent out notifications.
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.720]  It might be the 70% of the apps in the App Store, and some people who have perfectly
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.080]  good apps that are still working and have not needed functionality changes are very
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.120]  upset about that.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.400]  So you have these communications that occur without cooperation.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.720]  So they have poisoned the pool a little bit, or they've, you know, they've made that
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:23.360]  they've made that pool murky by not engaging in the kind of cooperative financial exchange
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:29.920]  that might have given people the desire to assume goodwill on their part.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.120]  So, and you know, absolutely, I'm sure some small component of this, and I think I agree
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:40.080]  with you, I mean, I definitely agree with you that I 100% am concerned about the privacy
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.800]  and security issue of sideloading.
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.280]  I don't believe in Apple.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:48.720]  I mean, Apple released that white paper last year that I found very tendentious.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.880]  It had a lot of arguments that didn't make sense when inspected, it felt like it was
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:58.960]  a marketing document, as opposed to one that was informed enough by technical reasons.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:04.080]  I think Apple is clever enough to create a sideloading process that requires enough hoops
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.040]  to go through that it would dramatically reduce the interest in most people in using it.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:14.560]  And the people who did use it would be protected to a fairly large extent, and only a small
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:20.320]  number of people would wind up disabling safeguards and installing malware that would overcome
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.640]  Apple's internal safeguards.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:25.680]  So I don't, I think they overstate the problem.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.800]  I think they could, I think they have to make it an existential issue.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:32.720]  If we allow sideloading, then it's going to be entirely unfettered and everything will
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.040]  suck and our platform will be destroyed.
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.680]  Instead of saying, we could produce a mediated version of this that is vastly more secure
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.920]  than Androids, and they could phase it in.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.240]  They could phase it in with requiring developer certification like they do with the Mac App
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.080]  Store, not allowing anything.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.040]  And also, again, they could have, you know, they can safeguard the users by, they could
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.240]  introduce additional sandboxing that's required.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.360]  Maybe there's multiple layers of plastic baggies you have to nest to run this app or
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.760]  something, or the app can't access all sorts of entitlements that apps that have been signed
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.480]  and certified are.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.520]  Chuck Liddell I really do think that it's not all about
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.000]  the money.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:10.720]  But...
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.480]  Dave Asprey No, it definitely, it's some...
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.040]  Chuck Liddell But...
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.240]  Dave Asprey The money is a factor, right?
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:16.560]  Chuck Liddell But the fact that if you're only looking
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.600]  at the money and how much of the money that goes through the App Store Apple has sought
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:30.320]  to take since its inception, you're not unreasonable at thinking, well, it is all about the money,
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:30.560]  right?
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.880]  Like, I do think that's incorrect, but I don't think it's an unreasonable assumption.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.240]  I don't think, and it's because Apple has never done anything.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.000]  You could, and I know, all right, I say they haven't done anything.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.160]  They have the small developer program for $1 million and under, and they switch to $85.15
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.400]  for subscription revenue after a year.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:58.720]  And so they've made some small concessions, but not as much as they, they haven't invested
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:08.160]  as much of their potential App Store revenue into fostering goodwill as is necessary.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.520]  That's the investment.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:14.560]  The investment is give up more of the share of the money that flows through apps that
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.400]  go through the App Store and consider it an investment in both developer goodwill and
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:27.120]  user goodwill and goodwill worldwide, even amongst people who aren't even Apple customers,
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.400]  but might be influential politicians or government regulators and can say, this company is not
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:39.280]  just keeping a stranglehold on the platform software solely to extract the maximum amount
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.320]  of revenue as they can.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.680]  Apple could have done, right, there's so many things they could have done.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:49.040]  And so it's reasonable for some people to say, I'm not giving Apple any benefit of the
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:49.600]  doubt.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.680]  So I assume it's entirely about money because I don't trust them on these other topics
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.600]  because they haven't exercised enough discretion in what they could do.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.120]  But I would also say, I think it depends on your level of technical sophistication.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.560]  So if you're an ordinary politician, let's say, who is not trained in technology, or
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.520]  if, you know, it could be a normal person who's not like us, not us people who are weirdo
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.680]  geeks, and we have studied this stuff and we have some concern and we get, even if we're
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.800]  not system level programmers, kernel level programmers, we get the issues.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.760]  We've read a thousand exploit reports.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.920]  The Ronan Farrow piece I wanted to highlight from The New Yorker last week in which he
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:31.520]  talks about, I mean, my God, NSO group, let him hang out in their offices for, my God,
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.640]  insane, these people.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:40.160]  But what comes out of that is he did an extremely good job of explaining some very deep exploits
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.000]  and how that works.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.680]  You know, where do you get the foot in the door?
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.880]  Where do you get that lever that allows you to put the crowbar in and crack open messages
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.960]  and bypass Blastor, you know, Apple's sandboxing thing.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.720]  So I think if you don't dig at that level, you'd say, look, Android exists.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:59.360]  It's the most popular platform in the world.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.320]  It's widely adopted.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.240]  There's all this diversity and sideloading about.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.760]  So what's the problem?
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.080]  What is Apple, what case is Apple making?
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.120]  Okay, maybe they have a privacy case, you might say, in that circumstance.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.720]  I don't buy their security argument.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.160]  I think that's a smokescreen, this person, punitive person might say.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.640]  The privacy thing, well, they already have all these privacy rules.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.680]  They can protect all the data.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.200]  They won't let apps gain it.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.560]  So it has to be all about money.
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.240]  They just, the people I think can discount the incredible level of vulnerability that
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.600]  Android is at.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.760]  There's so, you know, there's probably a billion vulnerable Android devices in the
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:38.000]  world and there's the vulnerability of iOS and iPadOS is only these brief windows in
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.880]  which there are zero days out there and only for very small numbers of people typically.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.080]  And I don't think people fully understand that.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.000]  I think we're going to need some kind of hack that, like, somebody produces one that
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.160]  disables 50% of Android phones.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.520]  And it's not infeasible that could happen based on the age and lack of updatability
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.360]  of so many Android devices on the market.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.680]  Right, except that the people who are talented enough to do it don't do pranks like that.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:04.720]  No, you're right.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.960]  They exploit it for nefarious purposes, which is to keep these things as under wraps as
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.720]  possible for as long as possible.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.200]  Yeah, this is something I had this discussion with someone last year.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.200]  We'd be better off with smarter teenagers who just want to prank the world and brick
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.080]  a billion iPhones or Android phones, whatever.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.280]  This is the thing like the NSO group and these other groups that are, you know, alleged to,
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.880]  well, they even claim they can break into all these different devices and kind of hijack
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.400]  them for what they claim are legitimate government purposes.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:38.800]  But the thing that I think is at one level, we are the safest as users who are not being
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.920]  targeted by governments.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:44.880]  There's a small number of people in relative terms who governments want to and other, you
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.080]  know, criminals and so forth, want to actively surveil.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.920]  And those people are at high risk.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.640]  But it's weird because the value of those exploits is so high in the, you know, you
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.080]  could sell them for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars or they're being developed
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.360]  by these private companies.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.760]  The rest of us are generally fairly secure because nobody wants to hack us.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.960]  They want to make a million dollars.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.560]  They don't need a hack of billion phones.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.080]  Right, it's so true, right?
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.840]  They're never going to do well, I say never, but it's very unlikely that they're going
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:20.080]  to do, like, unleash a mass attack against the entire billion-person iOS user base when
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.440]  Russia might do it, but not a kid in their bedroom.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:24.960]  Well, anyway, thank you, Glenn.
