[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Tough act to follow a
[00:02.820 --> 00:06.000]  Little bit. I'd like to thank Phil for warming up the crowd for me
[00:08.100 --> 00:10.320]  Also a very different vibe it's
[00:11.100 --> 00:17.940]  The live show atmosphere is so great and it it when it worked and it I think it worked pretty well last week
[00:17.940 --> 00:21.160]  It's pretty good feeling. I can't even imagine doing that every week though
[00:22.420 --> 00:24.260]  No, it's a different show
[00:24.260 --> 00:26.380]  It's yeah, it's great. But I mean, I
[00:26.380 --> 00:31.540]  I know you get nervous before a big interview, but you know, I'm not gonna be that hard to just you know
[00:31.540 --> 00:33.540]  I'll go easy on you
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.600]  That was pretty good though
[00:36.140 --> 00:39.260]  He's great. Yeah, you know what? He was way more candid than I thought it was gonna be
[00:39.260 --> 00:41.500]  I I don't think he would have done it
[00:41.500 --> 00:45.100]  Otherwise, you know, I mean like and I feel like that is that's the like
[00:45.100 --> 00:50.100]  I think that's the thing that people were most surprised by the other thing that I think people were surprised by was how clear it
[00:50.100 --> 00:54.380]  Was that he reads our stuff, you know, like his familiarity with Marco's
[00:54.380 --> 01:00.620]  Complaints and a couple of other things too, but it a couple people like the the the most common comments
[01:00.620 --> 01:07.620]  I got afterwards were Wow, that's a side of Phil Schiller. I've never seen before he was very, you know, he just was casual and
[01:08.260 --> 01:11.440]  Combined with Wow, he obviously, you know pays attention to us
[01:12.820 --> 01:19.100]  Yeah, well most too. I mean we've known for years that he's been meeting multi stuff, but it was nice of him to give a shout
[01:19.100 --> 01:20.820]  out to
[01:20.820 --> 01:26.040]  To you, you know to your level guests. It's very good. It was a fun time at the show, too
[01:27.740 --> 01:29.740]  Yeah, it was great
[01:30.300 --> 01:34.720]  But you know what good job and I told you in person but I'm sure everybody listening to this is thinking it
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.900]  You did not screw up. So get on here and you nailed him quite a bit not nailed him
[01:40.900 --> 01:42.900]  But you know what? I mean like you held his feet to the fire
[01:44.060 --> 01:50.380]  Yeah a little bit without being a jerk that was the dance, you know is how do I ask the you know questions that everybody
[01:50.380 --> 01:53.140]  In the room kind of wants me to ask and there's other ones that I miss too
[01:53.140 --> 01:57.980]  I mean we could and I had to it's like I had to decide what not to ask because you know an hour is
[01:58.820 --> 02:02.680]  A it was a little bit longer than I think that I told them that he'd be on stage
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.340]  I'd said like maybe like 45 50 minutes and I think he was on stage for like
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.860]  56 minutes or something like that, which was not a complaint. He thought it went well
[02:09.860 --> 02:11.860]  It was all smiles all around backstage
[02:11.860 --> 02:15.380]  But the other thing too is I feel like just the atmosphere of a live room
[02:15.380 --> 02:18.200]  You can't do it like we do on these, you know Skype
[02:18.200 --> 02:21.920]  Shows you can't go more more than in 60 minutes
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.920]  yeah, there's something about Skype that just lets you go off into the weeds and
[02:26.940 --> 02:31.000]  Whatever like take a break gather your senses and just not make sense a little bit
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.680]  But no, it's very direct
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.100]  Right, like we could have gone in like one that one thing like people have sent like oh, I wish I all you know
[02:37.200 --> 02:42.640]  That was a great interview, but I wish you would have you know talked about blank and the one that's very common is the App Store
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.720]  But I had one of the reasons I didn't is there was nothing really new about it
[02:47.720 --> 02:51.440]  And I kind of wanted to focus a little bit more on you know current event
[02:51.440 --> 02:54.400]  And the other thing too is I feel like once you open that can of worms
[02:54.400 --> 02:57.040]  That's a root, you know, that's hard to do in just a couple minutes
[02:59.040 --> 03:01.040]  It's a very complicated
[03:01.160 --> 03:03.940]  Thing I mean, but both the App Store distribution models
[03:04.840 --> 03:08.680]  What adapting existing business models to work on the App Store?
[03:09.600 --> 03:11.160]  provisioning
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.880]  Like the code signing nightmares. Oh, yeah and a big one too, especially and I don't know
[03:15.880 --> 03:22.120]  I actually don't know I suspect that my audience and the audience that was in the you know in the room for the live show
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.040]  It's skewed a little bit more towards Mac developers than the overall
[03:27.760 --> 03:33.560]  Apple developer community in general, but it's certainly of interest to me is the whole sandboxing
[03:34.200 --> 03:40.080]  Situation with the Mac and I kind of we can kind of get into that was you and I talked about some of the stuff
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.960]  Today, I kind of wonder whether the what are they calling this rootless thing?
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.600]  System integrity, right? I kind of hope that that might be a way of backing away from sandboxing
[03:51.720 --> 03:57.980]  Could be could be get there. Um, but I do think that I mean you only had an hour. Well, you had less on paper
[03:58.720 --> 03:59.760]  I
[03:59.760 --> 04:03.960]  agreed that Mac app store would or even any app store would have been a kind of worms and
[04:05.120 --> 04:08.920]  Frankly, he just couldn't answer anything. Yeah, I that's part of it
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.080]  Like I know I mean, I know he's the boss of the app stores, but I mean he's not gonna make
[04:13.800 --> 04:15.800]  promises on stage to you
[04:16.000 --> 04:18.000]  Like that, that's you know
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.080]  As forthcoming as he was with other stuff. He didn't say anything that was
[04:24.080 --> 04:27.000]  Counter to you know, he's very very good at its job
[04:27.400 --> 04:31.920]  He didn't say anything that was counted to the messaging about one thing that people asked throughout the week
[04:31.920 --> 04:37.020]  And so, you know, I love it. I do love WWDC and it's it is weird and different like I went to the
[04:37.020 --> 04:41.420]  The beer bash go to the beer bash this year. You probably didn't
[04:41.980 --> 04:47.700]  but I went and Dalrymple was there and I always go one of the and I'm always on the fences to whether to go Amy was
[04:47.700 --> 04:51.980]  with me out there all week as you know, and I always feel a little bad going to the beer bash because
[04:53.620 --> 04:55.620]  Actually, I did
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.980]  I knew you weren't there because that's who I left her with
[04:59.980 --> 05:02.780]  I left her with you now that I think about it
[05:02.780 --> 05:08.820]  But I go because it used to be in years past that that was the place where I would run into some people from Apple
[05:08.820 --> 05:10.820]  That I know who I hadn't seen
[05:10.820 --> 05:13.860]  throughout the week if you want to bump into somebody from Apple and
[05:14.180 --> 05:19.660]  Whether we end up talking about anything interesting or not, even if it's you know, just shooting the shit
[05:19.820 --> 05:23.500]  It's a good place to run into them and it's funny. That's what I thought about
[05:23.500 --> 05:27.460]  That's why I went and it turned out that it was really sort of the opposite
[05:27.460 --> 05:33.860]  It was people coming up to me who wanted to you know, say hi and thank me and etcetera etcetera. So you big shot
[05:33.860 --> 05:38.400]  That's what I know. Not really and I think the reason that it really it was it it was
[05:40.020 --> 05:41.940]  It was so
[05:41.940 --> 05:45.260]  Like one person after the other is that I was walking around with Dalrymple
[05:47.140 --> 05:49.580]  That's a rather distinctive figure a
[05:49.580 --> 05:56.820]  Little bit a little bit less less of one. Yeah, definitely. He looks great. He's lost some weight and he looks bad
[05:56.820 --> 05:58.820]  It looks looks younger. I
[05:59.180 --> 06:02.060]  Mean, yeah, exactly. I mean he always looked formidable
[06:02.700 --> 06:04.960]  Now he just looks like he will definitely mess you up
[06:05.660 --> 06:09.980]  And somehow I swear to God it's like he you know, but you want to talk about who's influential
[06:09.980 --> 06:12.880]  They only had three beers available at the beer bash and one of them was Heineken
[06:12.880 --> 06:20.560]  I was like did they I was like did they ask you or did they just do it in advance? He goes there. They're nobody
[06:23.440 --> 06:27.160]  So I went to his beard bad right party and I
[06:27.840 --> 06:33.280]  Ordered a Stella notice. Yeah, Stella. I didn't want to touch the Heineken just yeah, you're worried
[06:33.280 --> 06:36.440]  That's gonna I didn't well, I didn't know which way right like either
[06:36.440 --> 06:41.320]  I'm drinking his beer and he's gonna be pissed or I'm not drinking a Heineken and he's gonna be pissed
[06:41.320 --> 06:43.320]  That's uh, yeah
[06:47.200 --> 06:51.480]  Anyway we ought to get to it because we have a lot to cover and the whole idea the basic idea that I have for
[06:51.480 --> 06:52.920]  this episode is
[06:52.920 --> 06:54.680]  to cover
[06:54.680 --> 07:01.380]  More or less loosely the State of the Union stuff platforms. What do they call that session platforms platforms State of the Union?
[07:01.640 --> 07:04.620]  Platform State of the Union. Yeah, they used to break it up into like three
[07:04.620 --> 07:11.400]  I think and then right which is you know, the basic structure of Monday at WWDC is sort of remained unchanged
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.800]  Since forever, which is in the morning
[07:13.800 --> 07:20.420]  There's the main keynote and that's the one that the press gets led into and that's the one people line up all night for
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.600]  That's the one that anything that's written
[07:23.600 --> 07:29.000]  You know on my real TV or newspapers the next day all the news from there is what what comes out of it
[07:29.640 --> 07:32.920]  then they clear the room people go and have lunch and
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.920]  I
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.960]  Think around 2 30 is when it starts. It's a bit later. You have like a good two hours for lunch
[07:40.920 --> 07:42.920]  everybody but then at that point it's
[07:43.720 --> 07:49.360]  Real developer badges only you get to come in and then they have it's more or less a second keynote
[07:49.360 --> 07:51.480]  But it's truly for developers
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.760]  I mean like I was saying, you know, she was very good at its job
[07:56.760 --> 08:01.880]  And I believe he constrained all of his our answers to what was actually in the keynote
[08:01.880 --> 08:06.800]  Yeah, rather than the rest of the stuff and they've been getting a little bit loosey-goosey with the NDA stuff
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.200]  So I'm not really yeah, I don't think that that's I don't even think that that's I don't think there is stuff
[08:11.200 --> 08:14.140]  I don't think there is an NDA anymore because my Apple TV
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  there's a WWDC app and you can just I don't think I put my
[08:19.040 --> 08:23.800]  ADC so yeah, I've been watching that too and I wasn't sure if because the the login that I've got
[08:24.320 --> 08:28.280]  Has an Apple ID account like I wasn't sure if maybe it was cleared for
[08:28.280 --> 08:33.840]  Yeah, and they've been doing some stuff to combine the Apple IDs, but it's not the same Apple idea
[08:33.840 --> 08:35.360]  I usually sign in for a DC stuff
[08:35.360 --> 08:40.760]  I'm pretty sure that that stuff is just not they don't they don't really have an NDA anymore. I think they well
[08:40.760 --> 08:42.680]  I think they you know what? I'm
[08:42.680 --> 08:46.280]  Let's gamble my career, but it's not like I'm keeping my head down
[08:47.360 --> 08:51.600]  I'm pretty sure that this stuff is I just don't think that they're crazy about stuff like that anymore
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.880]  I don't know and it shouldn't be because I mean
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.320]  the
[08:56.320 --> 08:58.320]  pretty much everything they say is
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.320]  What you don't want to do is say what people say to you in private or in the labs or something, right?
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.840]  Because that's like oh, yeah, this is broken. Here's a workaround and you know, we can't talk about the future stuff
[09:10.840 --> 09:13.320]  But it gets a little bit more on the negative side
[09:13.400 --> 09:18.200]  But in a lot of ways WWDC especially because they sell out every year
[09:18.920 --> 09:23.340]  I don't want to call it. It's not a marketing or advertising thing, but it's
[09:23.340 --> 09:26.540]  It's one of the very few times it's a
[09:27.580 --> 09:33.700]  Year, if not the only time a year that Apple actually gets to speak to developers and in a way limiting that
[09:34.340 --> 09:36.340]  It's kind of productive
[09:37.140 --> 09:42.500]  Because it's not like Google doesn't know what the hell was said in every ad like WWDC session
[09:42.500 --> 09:45.780]  yeah, I think it's actually I think it's sort of this shift towards a
[09:46.460 --> 09:50.940]  More open Apple PR department and I'm not gonna put pin it all on Katie cotton
[09:50.940 --> 09:55.060]  But it you know, it ties in with her leaving
[09:55.060 --> 09:58.580]  I mean it started before well, you know a year or two ago
[09:58.580 --> 10:02.500]  I think when they lightened up on the NDA a little bit and she was still there
[10:02.500 --> 10:06.940]  Yeah, but it's definitely the shift that they're making and I think it was always about
[10:07.460 --> 10:11.060]  PR optics it was that they don't want people saying
[10:11.700 --> 10:17.200]  Anything in public about the beta version of OS they've shown until they've released the OS
[10:17.200 --> 10:23.280]  but now you know, they've even you know, there was there was obviously like an embargo on Monday morning where they seeded a bunch of
[10:23.280 --> 10:25.040]  people from the press with
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.280]  Yeah, that was a lot, you know, the the current developer beta of
[10:30.800 --> 10:33.200]  OS 10 el capitan
[10:34.120 --> 10:38.080]  And let them write about it. I mean and it's you know, I think they emphasized of all in fact
[10:38.080 --> 10:40.920]  I know because they gave me the same copy too. I
[10:40.920 --> 10:47.520]  I didn't write anything. I didn't know ties. I told them I was like there's an absolutely zero percent chance that
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.080]  I'm gonna be ready to write anything to publish anything by Monday, but they're like well take it anyway
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.600]  But I think they wanted you know, they wanted the people to know that it just emphasized that this is a preview
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.860]  It's a beta this you know, you're reviewing the ideas of what we're doing. Not the current state that they're in
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.800]  Right, and I just think in the past they just wanted the opposite. They did not want anybody writing about them
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.400]  Well, I think they're slowly growing into
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.200]  Like a comfort zone that they did not have in back in like the late night
[11:17.200 --> 11:19.640]  Yeah, like they were really on their heels for a while
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.840]  And so, you know, you can understand it backs to the wall being defensive kind of thing
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.680]  But you know, I'm too different
[11:27.680 --> 11:29.580]  Yeah, and I think I know and I you know
[11:29.580 --> 11:32.440]  I think Steve Jobs too was also a lot less
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.560]  Very willing to have people writing about stuff before it came out and you know and and the whole idea that stuff can change
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.560]  You know he want, you know
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.760]  I just feel like if something changes something that they announced last week ends up not shipping in the fall
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.840]  You know people are gonna call it out, but I don't think that he's gonna you know
[11:51.840 --> 11:54.520]  I think he was more crazy about stuff like that than Apple is now
[11:55.240 --> 11:58.920]  Yeah, well, I mean that's made clear in that becoming Steve Jobs
[11:58.920 --> 12:05.200]  Yeah, which please everybody read rather than the Isaacson biography. Well, we'd both right
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.560]  It's they're both worth reading. But if you're only gonna read one reading that one first
[12:09.320 --> 12:11.320]  Yeah, cuz I mean he's
[12:11.400 --> 12:15.620]  Even met these guys. I'm gonna blank on his name, but with the author of to whose
[12:16.600 --> 12:19.400]  Experiences it because there's two of them, but they'd they'd
[12:21.840 --> 12:23.840]  Forget it
[12:23.840 --> 12:28.480]  Anyway, yeah, oops, I got my show notes. Yeah
[12:31.320 --> 12:35.640]  There's there's parts of that story where he basically just Steve Jobs calls him up and
[12:36.440 --> 12:42.760]  Just yells at him for saying bad stuff about Apple and but they're friends like their kids hang out together and all that. So
[12:43.400 --> 12:45.400]  Brent is slender
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.240]  Okay
[12:47.240 --> 12:50.960]  But so yeah, I think a lot of that came from Steve and even if you were a pal
[12:50.960 --> 12:56.480]  I don't think he'd be shut it. Yeah, but so yeah times are changing Apple is
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.840]  the hugest of companies at this point, so
[13:01.240 --> 13:07.300]  You know, you never want to be punching down right? So I think I think there's more open attitude
[13:08.400 --> 13:10.400]  benefits
[13:10.640 --> 13:15.960]  But anyway, I who better to have on and I want to talk about some of this developer level news and try to put it
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.320]  in
[13:17.320 --> 13:24.280]  What would you call it layman's terms of what exactly Apple has done and there's a lot like you you've put together a pretty nice
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.440]  Outline, which is a lot more preparation than I usually do for the show and just looking at it. It's like man
[13:29.680 --> 13:31.680]  Well, I did have a tough act to follow
[13:33.080 --> 13:35.080]  There really is though
[13:35.160 --> 13:38.600]  The other takeaway I had from and watching the State of the Union
[13:38.600 --> 13:46.120]  It is that I I feel like Apple is really starting to get better at being a big company and
[13:46.840 --> 13:53.560]  It's and clearly a lot of this stuff has been delegated and it's a lot less is going through one person
[13:53.560 --> 13:55.240]  even like someone like
[13:56.240 --> 14:00.760]  Craig Federighi who obviously is in charge of the engineering teams in charge of
[14:01.480 --> 14:03.720]  both os 10 and iOS
[14:04.280 --> 14:06.280]  Clearly the man has a lot of responsibilities
[14:06.280 --> 14:09.400]  But there's a lot of stuff that's being delegated. I think clearly
[14:10.120 --> 14:13.720]  Because it's more stuff is being done year over year than before
[14:15.720 --> 14:19.720]  Seems that way certainly appears that way from the on stage presence
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.360]  That could have been a conscious decision to kind of bring more people on stage
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.440]  I mean, you'd probably know this more than I remember
[14:28.440 --> 14:34.280]  But it seemed to me that there was like a cast of five people that ran Apple for like ten years there
[14:34.280 --> 14:37.320]  Between 2001 to like let's say 2012
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.160]  They had like maybe five people on stage with a couple of
[14:41.160 --> 14:43.720]  Are you talking about the regular keynote or the State of the Union?
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.720]  Yeah, the regular keynote. Yeah, not the State of the Union. State of the Union was much broader
[14:48.760 --> 14:50.760]  always
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.640]  But this year they seem to broaden both the keynote and the State of the Union and a lot of the sessions
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.280]  Well, we mentioned I mentioned it with with the Schiller last week where you know, they've broken
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.920]  This streak where there weren't any women in the regular keynote now there have been women in the State of the Union
[15:06.920 --> 15:10.120]  I believe for a while and as a lot of people have brought up
[15:10.760 --> 15:14.120]  For years and years. I in fact as long as I've been going to WWDC
[15:14.120 --> 15:20.760]  This isn't even a new thing in the regular sessions. There have always been plenty of them that were presented
[15:21.720 --> 15:28.360]  By women either as the primary presenter or as one of the secondary presenters who comes up just to demo a certain thing
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.880]  simply because it there've always as long as I've
[15:32.840 --> 15:36.360]  known anybody at the company, there've always been a ton of talented women in
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.320]  You know in the engineering ranks and that's who presents at WWDC if you're you know, if there's a new API
[15:44.040 --> 15:45.240]  for
[15:45.240 --> 15:51.000]  Watch complications whoever worked on the watch complications part of the API does the presenting
[15:52.600 --> 15:54.600]  Yeah, did you know there's
[15:54.600 --> 15:58.520]  and I like that you brought that up with Schiller early on and and and I
[15:59.400 --> 16:04.440]  Felt he addressed it. Well, because I mean you said finally and he said well I could start which you know
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.880]  I totally believe in but there's a lot of really talented women developers. Yeah
[16:09.880 --> 16:17.160]  Oh, and and the thing is you're right like part of your job if you're at Apple at that level is to be able to present
[16:18.040 --> 16:20.040]  And they will spend the time with you and train you
[16:20.040 --> 16:26.200]  If you need it, but you know when it's your stuff and you're the you're responsible for it
[16:26.200 --> 16:31.720]  You expect it to get up and talk about it either internally which can also be really harrowing or you know
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.000]  In this case externally and the one thing I know that they're not gonna do in that and Schiller's answer last we emphasize it
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.640]  It's it's people. It's still people who are responsible for this
[16:39.640 --> 16:44.440]  So part of you know, the real thing isn't hey, we need to pick more women to be in the morning keynote
[16:44.440 --> 16:47.080]  It's we need to make sure that we're doing the right thing
[16:47.080 --> 16:53.000]  For women to be in the morning keynote. It's we need to make sure that the talented women in the company are getting promoted
[16:53.560 --> 16:56.220]  When they should be to be to have these areas of responsibility
[16:57.880 --> 17:03.160]  And combined with that I think it's what you mentioned before is that they've just in general
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.020]  broadened the number of people
[17:06.520 --> 17:09.080]  Regardless of whether they're men or women whether you know
[17:09.240 --> 17:15.880]  Whatever skin color they have just that there's more than just the top three or four people will get to present stuff in the keynote
[17:15.880 --> 17:18.920]  and yeah, I mean I do think the I
[17:19.960 --> 17:25.120]  Forget what that page is, but you know the senior presidents on that page. I mean, that's you know, predominantly white
[17:26.080 --> 17:27.960]  older men
[17:27.960 --> 17:30.120]  And that's you know, that's not great
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.940]  But it's also the truth and it's a sad reflection on the state of the industry as it is evolved
[17:35.840 --> 17:41.920]  Not that these people aren't awesome and created a chose but you know to mean like the there is certainly a lag time between
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.600]  Successful women getting up
[17:45.440 --> 17:51.280]  Well, and it's it's slowly happening and then and it's really nice to see them taking it seriously
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.880]  I don't feel the pain lip service to it because I know that there's a lot of women in
[17:58.760 --> 18:03.840]  See which position and there have been some you know, there it is changing in the right direction
[18:03.840 --> 18:06.880]  So Lisa Jackson is now she's not a senior vice president
[18:06.880 --> 18:09.900]  She's vice president, but she's in charge of their environmental stuff
[18:09.900 --> 18:15.700]  And their human resources chief is a woman. I you know, I've never met her but her name is Denise Denise Smith
[18:16.660 --> 18:18.540]  She's a black woman
[18:18.540 --> 18:23.060]  Lisa Jackson is a black woman or a woman of color over whatever the right terminology is
[18:23.060 --> 18:25.980]  But you know clearly adds to the diversity of that page
[18:26.180 --> 18:31.900]  the one thing that I so many people at readers and listeners of the show have have speculated on ever since
[18:32.460 --> 18:38.060]  she joined the company was that Angela aren'ts was going to become a major part of the keynotes and I
[18:38.060 --> 18:44.940]  Well, exactly, I think the real I think what some people thought was hey Apple only lets the SVPs speak on
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.500]  Keynotes
[18:46.500 --> 18:52.940]  She's the first non white guy in this in the SVPs, you know, the senior vice president
[18:52.940 --> 19:00.100]  So obviously she's going to speak whereas the way it works is she's only gonna get to speak if there's something about retail that is
[19:00.100 --> 19:01.100]  worth
[19:01.100 --> 19:06.140]  Putting in a keynote like if they do something if there's like a major new redesign of the retail stores
[19:06.140 --> 19:11.220]  And it's worth hey, you know, let's spend 10 minutes of this keynote explaining this
[19:11.740 --> 19:17.260]  Major new initiative we're taking with our retail stores, then she'll get to do it because that's her that's her domain
[19:17.260 --> 19:19.580]  But she they're not gonna bring her up to talk about
[19:22.220 --> 19:24.220]  The sales figures and we do
[19:25.260 --> 19:27.980]  Or something completely unrelated like
[19:29.180 --> 19:34.300]  Apple pay right? They weren't gonna have heard. Yeah. Well, no they had to yeah, they had the woman it was right
[19:34.300 --> 19:38.220]  Apple baby, right Apple Vegas because that's her domain right and and really what it is
[19:38.220 --> 19:43.740]  Is that like and it's like what Schiller said last week. It's so Jennifer Bailey. She's a vice president of the company
[19:43.740 --> 19:46.940]  She's not on that page, but she's a vice president and she's in charge of Apple pay
[19:48.380 --> 19:52.860]  She's a badass. She's been around for a long. Yeah. Yeah, definitely has been around for a long time
[19:52.860 --> 19:57.740]  And then Susan Prescott was the other woman on stage in the keynote and she's a vice president in the apps division
[19:57.980 --> 20:01.980]  So she's high up and she's definitely in charge of you know, she did the news thing
[20:01.980 --> 20:04.460]  So she's you know
[20:04.460 --> 20:09.500]  The the you know, the chief of that I guess you know, she the whole news thing is under her
[20:09.500 --> 20:11.500]  So it made sense for her to do the demo
[20:11.900 --> 20:17.260]  But it was only because they're expanding to like other lower levels of the company that they can do stuff like that
[20:17.260 --> 20:19.260]  Which I think is great
[20:19.260 --> 20:25.500]  Yeah, and you know Apple has had historical, you know, Ellen Hancock was a chief technical officer
[20:26.060 --> 20:29.420]  When they bought next but that's but but holding Ellen
[20:29.420 --> 20:33.820]  I know that yeah holding Ellen Hancock up as hey, there have been women in keynotes
[20:33.820 --> 20:37.900]  It's a bit of it was a bit of a stretch and it was wearing thin. Oh, no, I don't mean to do that
[20:37.900 --> 20:44.620]  I just I just mean that you know to have in the past being women in high levels, you know, sea level executives
[20:44.620 --> 20:49.020]  Yeah, and obviously they're not doing enough. Well, it's not that they're not doing that but I mean
[20:51.420 --> 20:54.300]  This kind of systemic change takes time
[20:54.300 --> 21:01.820]  Right, like you and I think just cherry-picking people to be either appear on the keynote is is is wrong and they're not doing that
[21:01.820 --> 21:03.820]  they're they are
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.740]  They're building up a
[21:07.820 --> 21:13.580]  good stable of like really effective speakers and and and I'm really happy that they're kind of
[21:15.420 --> 21:16.860]  Broadening
[21:16.860 --> 21:20.380]  More than like the four to five sort of caricatures that we used to see
[21:20.380 --> 21:23.980]  Like Shiller used that, you know, he used to jump off a roof
[21:24.860 --> 21:32.220]  With a Wi-Fi thing, right? Like they're and you know, these were caricatures and they're seems like they're expanding a little bit beyond that
[21:33.420 --> 21:35.420]  And that's I think that's good for
[21:35.980 --> 21:39.420]  This Apple and good. Good. I still I think Shiller will go down as well
[21:39.420 --> 21:45.340]  He certainly to this day the only he might end up being the only person ever who performed an actual stunt
[21:45.340 --> 21:52.620]  Live break, you know, yeah, exactly. I mean Google is still trying to catch up when they did that thing with the GoPros jumping out of plane
[21:52.620 --> 21:54.620]  Onto the top. Yeah, I remember that
[21:55.180 --> 21:59.580]  Yeah, guess what? Well, you know when you strap your VP or senior VP of marketing
[22:01.100 --> 22:03.420]  I'm into a plane then we can talk
[22:04.140 --> 22:10.780]  Let me take also, you know what it's funny because for years he see a Shiller came across as the because you played it that way
[22:10.780 --> 22:17.820]  He is well, but it was me. Yeah, definitely like I knew that anecdotally but just your conversation with him
[22:17.820 --> 22:24.380]  He's he's he's no dummy. No, absolutely not. No, and he's very very quick and you can you know
[22:24.380 --> 22:29.500]  There were a couple of things like he knew I was gonna bring up but there are a couple other things I didn't and I as I
[22:29.500 --> 22:31.500]  Was asking the covering
[22:34.140 --> 22:38.140]  There's like five people in that room that really are like, you know, I don't know what they're talking about
[22:38.140 --> 22:41.500]  There was like five people in that room that really got that
[22:41.820 --> 22:46.940]  I saw some tweets afterwards the people who the people who really got that joke really loved it. They felt like yeah
[22:47.340 --> 22:52.540]  Maybe that put a and he handled it. Well, he just laughed and he gave like a shrug like all right, you got me there
[22:53.420 --> 22:58.860]  Yeah, exactly. But that might be it might be a good example of the last time that apples, you know that that
[22:59.420 --> 23:04.380]  That apple pulled the carpet out from anybody, you know in terms of that general discussion of hey
[23:04.380 --> 23:09.340]  We give hints and if you follow our hints, you know, your job will be easier going forward
[23:09.500 --> 23:11.900]  Yeah, and he's totally right and you know
[23:11.900 --> 23:17.300]  That's kind of the exception that proves the rule because the year before they'd been encouraging it and then they were like, yeah
[23:17.300 --> 23:19.300]  no, we're not gonna do that, so
[23:19.500 --> 23:21.500]  that kind of sucked but
[23:22.340 --> 23:27.100]  He said is their track record was pretty good. He didn't even say they were banning a thousand
[23:27.100 --> 23:32.940]  Did I get that right a thousand a thousand would be the best. Yes. It's 100% Okay. He didn't even say that
[23:32.940 --> 23:36.300]  He said that you know, it's pretty good and it is pretty good
[23:37.340 --> 23:41.140]  So, you know, all right. Let me take a break. Thank you. Thank our first
[23:41.900 --> 23:45.040]  We actually haven't talked about anything, but we will
[23:46.220 --> 23:51.340]  Our first sponsor is our good friends at Harry's you guys know Harry's they make
[23:52.220 --> 23:54.220]  really high quality shaving products
[23:55.700 --> 23:59.940]  They've got little kits they here's the deal you go to Harry's calm and
[23:59.940 --> 24:04.900]  You can buy it to get started. You can get a kit. It starts. It's just like 15 bucks
[24:04.900 --> 24:07.960]  You get a razor blade you get a cup a couple of blades
[24:08.780 --> 24:15.980]  Some shaving cream really really high-end stuff. It's so nice. It's so much better made better designed
[24:16.380 --> 24:22.460]  Then then the stuff from Gillette or Schick or whatever the hell other mainstream brands there are I just noticed
[24:22.460 --> 24:26.780]  I've got so that the one they have they've they've got one called the Truman set. It's got this orange
[24:26.780 --> 24:31.060]  Like a plastic handle the one I have and it's from years now
[24:31.060 --> 24:32.940]  I mean if anybody's been listening to the show now
[24:32.940 --> 24:37.860]  You know how long Harry's has been an occasional sponsor of the show and when they got started
[24:37.860 --> 24:41.540]  They sent me this the Winston kit and I still have that. It's got a metal handle
[24:41.540 --> 24:46.120]  That's 25 bucks a little bit more expensive because it's made of metal. I was actually looking at mine the other day now
[24:46.120 --> 24:48.120]  I've had it at least two years. I was looking at it
[24:48.740 --> 24:54.140]  And I usually shave in the shower and I it always drops it falls in the tub all the time
[24:54.140 --> 24:57.020]  I was looking at it. It looks brand new
[24:57.020 --> 25:02.460]  Like it looks like I could put it back in the box and sell it back to somebody as mint condition
[25:02.460 --> 25:04.780]  This stuff is really really made to last
[25:07.140 --> 25:13.100]  Really well designed just sort of a classic look and they really take this stuff seriously they
[25:13.980 --> 25:17.780]  The blades they were buying them from some company in Germany
[25:17.780 --> 25:23.100]  They're German made blades and they like them so much that they just bought the whole factory and their make that's it
[25:23.100 --> 25:27.020]  They make their own blade. So they're not like just putting the Harry's brand on
[25:27.620 --> 25:28.940]  You know
[25:28.940 --> 25:34.740]  White label razor blades that they buy from anybody in the commodity market. They make the Rome blades. They're really good
[25:35.380 --> 25:40.380]  And the whole point that reason they can they can sell this stuff so much cheaper is that they're cutting out the middleman
[25:40.620 --> 25:42.700]  They make this stuff they package it
[25:42.700 --> 25:47.860]  They put it in really cool boxes you buy it and then they just ship it right to you free of charge free shipping on
[25:47.860 --> 25:48.980]  everything
[25:48.980 --> 25:55.140]  so there's no markup that you get by going through distributors and distributors selling it to drugstores and
[25:55.380 --> 26:01.940]  the drugstore is putting their markup on it and then the drugstores because there's people shoplift stuff like razor blades all the time putting it
[26:01.940 --> 26:05.580]  Behind those stupid glass cabinets with a lock and then you got to find an employee
[26:05.860 --> 26:08.800]  None of that you just go to Harry's calm you order it
[26:09.420 --> 26:11.740]  15 bucks will get you everything you need to get started
[26:11.740 --> 26:18.780]  And then once you find out that the stuff is just as good as I've been telling you you can order and stuff like new blades
[26:19.260 --> 26:26.100]  That they're under two bucks a pop if you get them in quantity way less than then the big brands are
[26:26.440 --> 26:31.220]  Even when you buy them at places like Amazon if you get like a Gillette or whatever other brand like that
[26:31.260 --> 26:36.060]  So you pay less you got a better product and it could not be more convenient
[26:36.060 --> 26:41.660]  So great stuff if you have any reason to buy any kind of shaving stuff go check them out
[26:41.660 --> 26:43.660]  here's where you go you go to Harry's calm and
[26:46.180 --> 26:52.760]  Use the code talk show no the just talk show and on your first order you'll save five bucks
[26:54.100 --> 26:59.060]  Fantastic deal. So go there check them out Harry's calm and the code is just plain talk show
[27:00.860 --> 27:05.220]  No joke, I use the Molotov they they sponsored a show too and I
[27:05.220 --> 27:09.420]  I got hooked and I do use it. So use debug. I
[27:10.460 --> 27:12.820]  Don't because don't because I don't actually think that
[27:13.620 --> 27:18.540]  The talk show you could try debug. No, I think Harry's is one of the ones but but I swear to God
[27:18.540 --> 27:23.700]  I do use it. Like I'm actually a fan. Yeah, I I probably wouldn't have followed up
[27:23.700 --> 27:26.020]  but they you know, they sponsored us so they give us like
[27:26.860 --> 27:32.380]  the the shaving creams and the the aftershave and the razor and the blades and
[27:32.380 --> 27:34.500]  And you know now he's yeah
[27:34.500 --> 27:38.940]  and they've been doing a thing to also like sort of like Apple does where they come out with the first thing and
[27:38.980 --> 27:44.460]  Then they slowly iterate over time where they've slowly added a few new things like they started out
[27:44.460 --> 27:46.460]  I think they only had a shaving cream
[27:47.100 --> 27:52.900]  And then they had a phone they had one and not the other and I think they added the gel is the second thing
[27:52.900 --> 27:56.260]  Cuz a lot of people prefer a gel now you get our choice when you buy any kit
[27:56.260 --> 28:00.260]  You can choose between shaving cream shaving gel, whichever one you prefer. They've got both
[28:00.260 --> 28:01.700]  all
[28:01.700 --> 28:03.540]  sorts of other stuff and now they've got an
[28:03.540 --> 28:07.460]  They had if you listen to me a few weeks ago, if you were smart you bought it for your father's day
[28:07.460 --> 28:09.620]  They had a father's day kit, but they're already sold out of it
[28:10.460 --> 28:12.140]  Might be a little too late now anyway
[28:12.140 --> 28:15.980]  Since it was not coming out until two days before anyway, if you were smart two weeks ago
[28:15.980 --> 28:17.980]  You would have listened to me and bought that
[28:18.180 --> 28:20.780]  Yeah, that's a good gift. You know what my
[28:20.780 --> 28:29.180]  My lady friend's dad wants a gun cleaning kit and a knife. Yeah, so, you know, I'm gonna treat her, right?
[28:32.580 --> 28:36.100]  That guy seems like she's like a retired CIA guy or something
[28:36.540 --> 28:41.180]  I'm scared to death of this guy. I hope he's not asking for that stuff because of you
[28:44.500 --> 28:47.960]  All right, let's talk about some of this technical stuff from the
[28:47.960 --> 28:50.880]  the WWDC and it really is a lot
[28:52.160 --> 28:54.160]  Do you want to go in the order of your?
[28:54.320 --> 28:58.920]  Your outline. Well, I mean because we segue from the Schiller. So yeah. Yeah
[28:58.920 --> 29:03.580]  Yeah, so the first thing that you have in the list and I think it's a good topic is the app thinning
[29:04.360 --> 29:10.920]  and I think that I think that ties into the whole idea that from Federighi in the morning keynote about how they
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.360]  Significantly cut down on what's going to be the over-the-air size of or I don't know
[29:17.360 --> 29:24.800]  But the over-the-air size but the minimum required open storage on your device to get started with the up update to iOS 9
[29:24.800 --> 29:27.000]  I think it's got to be really yeah, I
[29:27.720 --> 29:30.400]  Think so. I think it was it six to seven
[29:31.200 --> 29:35.080]  You needed like four gigabytes free four gigs down to like one point
[29:35.080 --> 29:40.720]  so I think there's probably two things are a app thinning which will describe in good detail in a moment and
[29:41.320 --> 29:43.480]  probably that new fancy-pants
[29:44.520 --> 29:46.520]  comps I
[29:46.520 --> 29:50.720]  Confession algorithm they mentioned it's probably a combination thing
[29:50.720 --> 29:56.720]  I wonder too if they're doing some of the resource stuff over, you know, like oh, we're definitely sorry
[29:56.720 --> 29:58.720]  Yeah, when it's so app thinning is
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  three things basically
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  and
[30:04.280 --> 30:07.620]  It is on-demand resources which are
[30:09.720 --> 30:14.160]  If the example that they give is a game where if you
[30:14.160 --> 30:15.640]  You
[30:15.640 --> 30:20.240]  You're not going to get to level 10 if you just start playing the game until a little bit
[30:20.240 --> 30:23.700]  So you can have resources that are included in your application
[30:23.700 --> 30:28.280]  But are not actually downloaded from the App Store until you start to need to use them
[30:29.520 --> 30:33.920]  So that's big so you downloads can be small, but you can actually have a big
[30:34.680 --> 30:36.680]  application in general
[30:37.000 --> 30:40.080]  It used to be like I remember back in
[30:40.080 --> 30:46.240]  In 2008-2009 when we were shipping tap tap revenge stuff we
[30:47.920 --> 30:55.120]  Sweated getting the app down to the size where it would be okay to download over cellular
[30:55.560 --> 30:58.720]  And I forget what it was at that time 10 megabytes something like that
[30:59.440 --> 31:02.960]  And we had like a lot of graphics and audio files, which you know
[31:03.960 --> 31:05.960]  mp3s add up
[31:05.960 --> 31:12.240]  So, you know, I think now the direct download size is limited
[31:12.240 --> 31:15.240]  I forget what it's limited to and it's kind of a moving target
[31:15.240 --> 31:20.600]  But the total download size with these on-demand resources is about 20. Yeah, and it's definitely an issue
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.640]  I write I see it a lot. I don't download a lot of games myself, but Jonas does and it's
[31:26.560 --> 31:28.560]  it's always like
[31:28.680 --> 31:30.680]  You know sitting on a whoopee cushion
[31:30.680 --> 31:36.480]  Emotionally when it's like hey, can I get this new app and you know, we say yes, but we're out, you know
[31:36.480 --> 31:43.800]  Who knows, you know, we're out and about we're not in the house and it's like want want over the over the cellular download limit
[31:43.800 --> 31:49.000]  And so it's definitely a big deal and you know, that was a huge engineering challenge for us
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.240]  Like we we sweated that because you need the impulse button for those kind of pop. Yeah, you know, because I mean, I mean
[31:55.240 --> 31:59.800]  I mean doing Jonas remember that when you go sometimes and sometimes not right and
[31:59.800 --> 32:05.400]  And even if it's even if most of the time you still remembered to get the same game when you're back on Wi-Fi
[32:05.720 --> 32:07.720]  You're gonna lose some some number of
[32:08.360 --> 32:14.480]  Downloads that you would have gotten otherwise. Yeah, and that's a definitely a big deal. So I think it's a huge win for
[32:15.240 --> 32:17.080]  game developers
[32:17.080 --> 32:19.120]  yeah, so I mean this does go to the
[32:21.080 --> 32:24.160]  Shields remark on the 16 gigabyte which was kind of an unanswered
[32:24.160 --> 32:31.440]  Little well, but at the same time they're backing that up with a bunch of this technology that that they've put into
[32:31.960 --> 32:36.160]  iOS 9 in order to try to make that I mean he I
[32:36.680 --> 32:40.560]  Don't I don't want to say waffle, but he was vague in the hand wavy about
[32:41.160 --> 32:43.160]  Well, we're doing more things with the cloud
[32:44.640 --> 32:46.400]  But
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.160]  You know the the technology that they've actually been adding
[32:50.160 --> 32:57.680]  supports that supports the fact that they were sports the argument that they really do want to make 16 gigabytes of value and
[32:59.200 --> 33:01.480]  not a value and viable
[33:03.160 --> 33:04.440]  Footprint
[33:04.440 --> 33:10.960]  Well, and like my argument was I'm guessing most people listening to this episode probably listen to that episode
[33:10.960 --> 33:12.960]  I mean that episode pretty good numbers
[33:12.960 --> 33:18.920]  I hope so. Stop listening to me. But my argument my framing was that Apple
[33:19.440 --> 33:26.360]  for a year ever since Steve came back has done this good better best three-way framing of a product line and that to me with
[33:26.360 --> 33:27.720]  the 64 6
[33:27.720 --> 33:35.180]  16 64 128 split it's a little bit more like ok better best like it's hard for me to justify calling 16 good
[33:35.440 --> 33:42.720]  And you know, he he made the best case he could I think that 16 is pretty good and and and depending on your needs
[33:42.720 --> 33:49.160]  that if you're gonna shoot a lot of video then no you want to upgrade but if you are buying devices for a
[33:49.680 --> 33:52.680]  Enterprise type employee type thing that you don't need that
[33:53.040 --> 33:59.000]  Yeah, and but you know that you can store stuff like with photo even with video you can use iCloud
[33:59.600 --> 34:01.600]  photo storage and
[34:01.600 --> 34:07.880]  Not keep all of your video on your device and still have access to it on the fly when you need it by downloading it
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.200]  When you need it
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.740]  Yeah, I mean if your company's buying a thousand of these and giving them out to employees, it's for emailing
[34:14.560 --> 34:16.800]  doing calendar and messages and that kind of stuff and
[34:17.880 --> 34:21.040]  It's you know, maybe 60 gigs is fine for that
[34:21.560 --> 34:25.400]  Also, I'd like I did I mean not to get too meta but the way you frame that question was good
[34:26.200 --> 34:28.200]  because you I mean you kind of
[34:28.840 --> 34:32.640]  You bracketed off good better best and then
[34:33.320 --> 34:36.400]  Then showed that it wasn't actually that good. So
[34:36.400 --> 34:38.400]  and on the other hand
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.680]  You know, they are making
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.760]  They're investing a lot of software effort in order to make these lower
[34:47.840 --> 34:49.560]  capacity phones
[34:49.560 --> 34:54.040]  The other thing I got so I got a lot of feedback on that question from people and some people were like wow
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.080]  You did a great like what you just said you did a great job framing that in a way that you know
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.540]  You asked a tough question, but you did it in a respectful way where you weren't
[35:02.320 --> 35:04.360]  Being you know, it wasn't confrontational
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.160]  confrontational other people were like
[35:07.960 --> 35:15.120]  You didn't you should have followed up on that after his answer and pressed him on it further or other people who made
[35:15.120 --> 35:16.760]  What is a good point?
[35:16.760 --> 35:23.080]  Was that I'm it's like my own personal perspective on this where I'm really only interested in the current generation devices
[35:23.280 --> 35:26.960]  I didn't even mention the fact that they're still selling 8 gigabyte devices
[35:27.160 --> 35:32.940]  Like if you buy the iPhone 5c, which is the one that's I think currently free with contract
[35:32.940 --> 35:36.500]  You only get 8 gigabytes of storage, which is really low
[35:36.660 --> 35:39.620]  But I do think like you said like with this whole app thinning thing
[35:39.620 --> 35:44.500]  They're not it's not like they're selling them and engineering has software engineering has left them behind
[35:44.700 --> 35:48.100]  like I think more than ever they're really focused on
[35:48.820 --> 35:54.820]  making sure that the entire array of these iOS devices that they're selling are are
[35:56.180 --> 36:01.120]  Moderately useful to you know, pretty pretty good devices going forward. Yeah
[36:01.120 --> 36:03.120]  my other I mean
[36:04.280 --> 36:05.720]  This is
[36:05.720 --> 36:12.600]  pretty much I'm substantiated but my understanding is that the the RAM chips that they use in the 16 gigabyte
[36:14.040 --> 36:22.080]  They don't come in 32. Yeah, so they need to find a different supplier like things get like there's complicated stuff there that
[36:22.960 --> 36:29.120]  Yeah, that's that's something I think we there's like there's some basic we heard this from the same person last week
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  But you know sort of off the record. Yeah
[36:31.760 --> 36:39.160]  but that it's a little bit more complicated than just the product marketing implications of the the way that it if
[36:39.360 --> 36:42.720]  16 to 64 to 128 is the split boy
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.000]  there's an awful lot of people who are if they were on the fence might have gone with the look if it was
[36:47.160 --> 36:50.560]  32 at the low end would have bought that 32 but instead by the
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.360]  Hundred dollars spend the extra hundred dollars to get the 64 clearly that's part of it
[36:56.360 --> 37:02.720]  but that we heard that there's a technical reason and it was that that it sounds crazy because I know that if the if the
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.780]  32-gigabyte chip chips did exist. It wouldn't be it's not a hundred dollar expense to Apple
[37:07.780 --> 37:11.240]  It's a couple of bucks at the most but that but that there what?
[37:12.400 --> 37:14.440]  Something very very specific about these chips
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.320]  But that the 32 ones actually weren't there and that if they wanted to have them in the quantities
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.480]  they needed 16 was actually, you know, there was actually like a
[37:23.560 --> 37:25.560]  What would you call it an operational?
[37:25.560 --> 37:32.480]  Advantage to 16 64 128, right? Yeah. So, you know, I mean, you know that I
[37:34.080 --> 37:37.600]  Can't it's not like I've spoken to the guy that actually buys all of this stuff
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.880]  But you know, I that seems plausible to me and it's also not something feels gonna say
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.280]  But on the other hand, they're trying to make it work. So really are all of this software technologies
[37:48.960 --> 37:51.600]  Yeah, and a lot of it. There's an awful lot of things
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.160]  It's gonna keep coming up because if we even get to Swift and stuff like that, but boy
[37:55.160 --> 37:57.400]  the whole and you know
[37:57.400 --> 38:01.160]  and and one of the things that Schiller said last week and I do think we're starting to see is is that a lot of
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.760]  these things are years in the making and
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.760]  Some of it many years maybe close to a decade. I mean, when did Apple first?
[38:09.960 --> 38:17.800]  Bring Chris Latner and hire him and sort of adopt LLVM as as their official, you know compiler technology going forward
[38:17.800 --> 38:22.120]  Oh, I should know this off the top of my head it may not
[38:22.520 --> 38:29.440]  It's probably close to less than I'm close to tenure close to but I think less like I think 10 years is on the outside
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.560]  because he wrote a brilliant paper and he got LLVM going basically because
[38:38.160 --> 38:42.040]  GCC stank and that's not a I
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.320]  I don't know if there's a lot of open source students that listen to this and they're going to get all bent out of shape
[38:47.320 --> 38:51.240]  about GCC, but it was great for its time really hard to
[38:52.040 --> 38:57.200]  Sort of make the advancements that are that we're saying with the LLVM
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.040]  The I mean the FreeBSD is adopted it
[39:02.040 --> 39:06.800]  I think there's some some work for Linux, but I I can never keep track of all of that
[39:06.800 --> 39:13.120]  I'm here from Wikipedia Wikipedia that reports that Apple hired him in 2005. So ten years
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.800]  Okay, and obviously they've been reaping rewards from that big and small
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.560]  every year step-by-step
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.760]  But oh, yeah
[39:21.760 --> 39:23.840]  It's changed the development tool
[39:23.840 --> 39:31.280]  but it's really starting to the the the way that that's it's not just like the first couple of years of
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.920]  Advantages of switching from GSC to LLVM. We're really about
[39:35.920 --> 39:42.600]  developers were the only people who saw those advantages and now we're starting to see this trickle out into
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.880]  user facing features things that would not have been possible with GCC, I believe like
[39:49.600 --> 39:51.600]  abscising Oh
[39:52.880 --> 39:55.600]  Don't you think you think I'm wrong? No, you're totally wrong
[40:00.040 --> 40:01.920]  Just
[40:01.920 --> 40:08.240]  Just to double down on on latinard latinard is like a snowball rolling downhill and it's like exponential impact
[40:08.880 --> 40:10.880]  He's doing a great job
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.600]  We'll get to Swift eventually, but he's killing it. So abscising is
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.440]  Back in the next days before Apple even bought them
[40:22.120 --> 40:28.240]  They had what was called fat binaries which are what we call universal binaries, which basically had
[40:28.880 --> 40:30.880]  code segments for each of the different
[40:30.880 --> 40:37.000]  Chip architectures that the application is going on. So, you know power PC or Intel or HP or
[40:37.720 --> 40:39.920]  Sun spark stations that kind of thing
[40:40.920 --> 40:42.920]  The idea is that there's a tiny
[40:43.920 --> 40:47.560]  sort of table of contents at the beginning of the file and then you
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.680]  Jump to the correct page and start and start reading the same book in in your own language
[40:55.680 --> 41:00.680]  And one book would help like four or five different versions
[41:01.480 --> 41:06.200]  Of the text each translated as appropriate for the architecture that you were running on
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.320]  And those were called fat binaries that that became universal apps
[41:12.080 --> 41:17.160]  On the Mac with Intel and power PC and now 32 and 64 bit ARM
[41:17.840 --> 41:24.920]  and one of the things that would happen on old next machines was that people would run a
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.600]  a command line which I believe still exists called lipo and
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.440]  What lipo would do would go into one of the executable files and strip out the architectures that?
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.280]  Weren't native to where you're gonna run the app and that would save you some space and back in those days
[41:42.280 --> 41:45.240]  There wasn't a lot of space so that that would be something that you know
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  people would like to do
[41:48.520 --> 41:52.800]  App slicing is very similar except that it happens on the App Store level
[41:52.800 --> 41:54.400]  Now
[41:54.400 --> 41:56.400]  When you download an app
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  on iOS 9 using app slicing
[42:00.240 --> 42:05.360]  Only the code that is appropriate for the device that you're downloading it for will be downloaded
[42:05.560 --> 42:12.520]  So you won't have extraneous code for 32 bit ARM 64 bit ARM and what have you
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.360]  Further and this is probably the biggest win is that resources will be culled that aren't appropriate
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.960]  So if you have like an iPhone 6
[42:24.360 --> 42:32.040]  You will only download the at 2x instead of the 3x resources that should be included for the 6 plus
[42:32.960 --> 42:34.960]  right, so
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.200]  It will only it will be the minimum
[42:37.840 --> 42:40.800]  Footprint it will be only exactly what the application needs
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  and that
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.480]  will you know that that will be have huge gains in terms of the application download size and the footprint on the
[42:51.720 --> 42:53.720]  Device itself. Yeah
[42:55.080 --> 42:58.400]  And it's yeah, it seems like that's going to be a big deal and it happened
[42:58.400 --> 43:05.680]  So you submit as a developer you submit one app with everything all of your resources your 32-bit your 64-bit
[43:05.680 --> 43:12.520]  We compiled output you submit that to the App Store and then the App Store takes care of
[43:13.160 --> 43:14.840]  serving the
[43:14.840 --> 43:19.920]  Sliced up. Here's the here's here's only what you need version to the customers
[43:20.800 --> 43:22.800]  Right. Yeah
[43:22.880 --> 43:26.600]  Which is great and it's one of the benefits of having an app
[43:26.920 --> 43:33.840]  You get to slice and dice as you need to and download the appropriate right and so it's another way that apps can a it
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.120]  Just saves everything. Anyway, it's less energy less networking
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.520]  It's you know a little bit, you know a little it's good for everybody to say everything's gonna be faster
[43:42.520 --> 43:45.280]  But it's another way that apps can get under the cellular limit, too
[43:47.080 --> 43:48.800]  No, definitely
[43:48.800 --> 43:54.720]  Yeah on demand was is a big one and app slicing will also help a lot. Yeah, especially with the
[43:56.160 --> 44:01.160]  There's so many devices now with so many requirements and resources are getting kind of blown out
[44:01.160 --> 44:03.040]  Um
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.040]  It's gonna help a lot. It's gonna
[44:05.320 --> 44:11.080]  Make it so that every app that you download is saying in terms of you
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.320]  Yeah, because one of the other one of the other things that's interesting to me about iOS 9
[44:14.320 --> 44:18.200]  I'm not surprised because they're still selling the a5 with
[44:19.040 --> 44:23.200]  The the the entry model non retina iPad mini
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.640]  And since they're still selling it that makes sense that they're still supporting it with iOS 9
[44:28.640 --> 44:35.280]  But you know, presumably they're gonna have new iPads and new iPhones later this year
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.840]  So it's only going to be adding to the number of devices
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.720]  so now we're going all the way from a non retina 1x stuff like the
[44:45.240 --> 44:48.080]  But like I said the entry-level iPad mini the
[44:49.280 --> 44:52.400]  iPad touch is iPod touch is still being sold
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.180]  Those are a5 devices that are or I guess the iPod touch is retina, but you know
[44:58.180 --> 45:03.920]  They're still non retina device being sold still being supported all the way up to 3x devices like the 6 plus
[45:05.800 --> 45:07.920]  Yeah, yeah and the you know
[45:09.920 --> 45:16.000]  Again this kind of backs up what she was saying with trying to make you know that that's a big investment
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.880]  You know, did they put a lot of work into making that work or happen? So
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.320]  You know, it's not just lip service and trying to fob it off as some like the marketing guys being like no
[45:26.320 --> 45:31.880]  No, it's great. They're they're trying to tell another thing they announced and I think this is the first time is that
[45:32.720 --> 45:38.400]  And this is it's a real struggle for developers if they're if you're doing something that really presses the limits of the device
[45:38.880 --> 45:40.880]  think high-end game
[45:40.880 --> 45:46.240]  High-end game think something like pixelmator for iOS
[45:47.360 --> 45:53.120]  You're really really stretching the limits if you want to both take advantage of the latest
[45:53.680 --> 45:58.200]  Hardware and the fastest graphics stuff that's that's on like the current state-of-the-art
[45:58.880 --> 46:02.680]  iPhone and iPad and yet still be able to even launch on
[46:03.440 --> 46:05.440]  the a5 based ones
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.760]  So well, they still have to write the same code well
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.420]  but the one thing that you mean vaps well that the other thing that they announced this was in the morning keynote with with
[46:14.880 --> 46:21.400]  Craig where they announced that you if it's up to you as the developer, but you can submit an app now for iOS that
[46:22.240 --> 46:23.440]  requires
[46:23.440 --> 46:25.440]  64-bit
[46:25.800 --> 46:30.960]  Yeah, oh that yeah, that's huge and effectively that means the
[46:30.960 --> 46:38.280]  a7 or later because the a7 with the iPhone 5s was the first 64-bit
[46:39.280 --> 46:41.280]  Yeah, they're very rarely
[46:41.940 --> 46:43.360]  Given us
[46:43.360 --> 46:45.240]  for like a better word
[46:45.240 --> 46:48.260]  Break points in terms of what can and can't be supported
[46:49.320 --> 46:54.440]  Generally, they want if an OS level supports it they want third parties to support it
[46:56.520 --> 46:58.520]  This is one of the few that
[46:58.520 --> 47:00.000]  And
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.520]  You know, they added this in order to exactly like support stuff like high-end graphic stuff or high-end games
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.320]  Because you know like a lot of these things the older architectures just can't handle it and you can't
[47:16.120 --> 47:22.960]  The development burden of supporting these older systems is going to outweigh any benefit that you have to them and
[47:23.240 --> 47:25.320]  Yet in the App Store, there's no way to
[47:25.320 --> 47:32.160]  Indicate that well, there is but it's terrible. Like I guess you've seen it. I'm sure as you see like in the app description
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.680]  It'll it'll say hey if you if you're not using
[47:37.520 --> 47:42.760]  You know a7 or above or something like that. They'll say don't download this game
[47:44.880 --> 47:46.880]  Yeah
[47:46.920 --> 47:52.320]  Yeah, I'm I mean to express that in a manner such that the App Store can
[47:52.320 --> 47:55.040]  and nobody wants to cheat their customers
[47:55.800 --> 47:58.040]  Well, I mean some people do well
[47:58.040 --> 48:04.440]  you know the majority of people are good actors and nobody wants them to download something that they can't possibly run and yet there was
[48:04.440 --> 48:06.000]  no programmatic or
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.840]  There was no way to express that this game requires a certain level of hardware in order to be even remotely fun
[48:13.440 --> 48:18.380]  So they've added that which isn't which is nice because I mean in the old days people were switching on like
[48:18.380 --> 48:22.980]  Can this app shoot video? Yeah, like does it have a camera?
[48:22.980 --> 48:27.700]  like there was some weird stuff that happened to coincide with like faster processors and
[48:28.180 --> 48:34.020]  So they claimed that they needed some certain part of GP. Yeah, like a video camera. Yeah video is a good
[48:34.660 --> 48:40.820]  GPS whatever it was. Yeah, it was like well, we know that this device is faster and
[48:41.740 --> 48:43.840]  It also has this other thing
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.920]  So we're going to peg it on the other thing in order to trick the App Store into not limiting who can buy it
[48:50.600 --> 48:53.240]  That's a crummy experience all around
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.280]  Because you're lying to Apple you lying to the customers and you you know, it's just bad
[48:58.360 --> 49:04.520]  Let's come back and talk about bitcode. But let me do another sponsor read and but remind me if I forget
[49:05.720 --> 49:11.320]  Want to do let me remember that where we'll pick this up is talking about bitcode. I
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.800]  want to tell you about our good friends at igloo igloo is
[49:16.280 --> 49:23.920]  The internet you will actually like you can share news organize files coordinate calendars manage projects
[49:24.760 --> 49:32.320]  And more all in one place. It's a place. It's an online intranet for your team your organization your business
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.780]  Whatever you want to call it your group where you can do all this stuff in one place
[49:37.780 --> 49:45.860]  And you can do it on every device. It's all web-based. It works great. Everything looks great on phones tablets
[49:46.580 --> 49:47.940]  desktops
[49:47.940 --> 49:51.180]  Big displays small displays anything you want. It's gonna look great
[49:51.820 --> 49:59.100]  Their latest upgrade they call it Viking. That's like the you know, like the El Capitan version number of their stuff
[49:59.100 --> 50:01.100]  They give them names like that
[50:01.900 --> 50:03.700]  Viking revolves around
[50:03.700 --> 50:10.620]  Documents and how you interact with them gather feedback and make changes they've even had the ability to track who has read
[50:10.780 --> 50:13.140]  critical information to keep everyone on the same page
[50:13.780 --> 50:19.140]  So it's like read receipts in your email or read receipts on iMessage something like that
[50:19.540 --> 50:22.700]  But it's a lot more like iMessage than emails because it's not annoying
[50:22.700 --> 50:30.020]  It's just this little indication of who's read what and that helps you track whether key colleagues have read and acknowledged
[50:30.020 --> 50:36.540]  Policies or legal agreements or something like that and if you don't need that then you don't need to you don't need to worry about
[50:36.540 --> 50:38.420]  it, but if you do
[50:38.420 --> 50:42.980]  It's a major upgrade to igloo that maybe was keeping you from using it before so that's great
[50:42.980 --> 50:48.220]  If your company or your team has a legacy intranet that looks like it was built in the 90s
[50:48.220 --> 50:52.900]  It's probably because it was built in the 90s and you should give igloo a try
[50:53.060 --> 50:55.460]  Here's where you go to find out more go to
[50:56.220 --> 50:58.220]  igloosoftware.com

[51:04.540 --> 51:06.860]  format for ten people or fewer
[51:07.560 --> 51:10.900]  You could just use it in for as long as you want free of charge
[51:11.020 --> 51:11.700]  That's it
[51:11.700 --> 51:14.780]  And so if you've got a team that's fewer than ten people igloo is free

[51:30.040 --> 51:33.440]  dot-com slash the talk show for sponsoring the show
[51:33.960 --> 51:39.860]  All right. What were we the Canadians the Canadians? They might as well be like, I don't know. Maybe they are I think they are
[51:40.520 --> 51:43.140]  They're very nice. So I suspect that they are
[51:45.080 --> 51:47.720]  Every time I interact with them, they're very very nice people
[51:48.280 --> 51:51.640]  They got a big Canadian. It's the only it's the only explanation
[51:51.640 --> 51:53.760]  Oh, that's right bitcode
[51:53.920 --> 51:54.560]  All right
[51:54.560 --> 52:00.360]  explain bit so and because I think that this this seems to me like something that even in the in the State of the Union was
[52:00.360 --> 52:03.080]  Sort of they went through this very very quickly
[52:03.480 --> 52:08.480]  Yeah, yeah, so they talked about it. They kind of skimmed over it
[52:09.960 --> 52:11.480]  This session
[52:11.480 --> 52:12.640]  explanation
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.840]  Originally mentioned it and then they expunged it like they updated the explanation in the WWC app
[52:17.840 --> 52:24.520]  At to remove mention of bitcode and it wasn't really spoken about much publicly after that
[52:25.880 --> 52:27.520]  but
[52:27.520 --> 52:30.760]  my impression from what they said on stage was that
[52:31.760 --> 52:34.720]  bit code was effectively a marketing term for
[52:37.480 --> 52:39.920]  It's gonna get this is gonna get nerdy but
[52:40.320 --> 52:46.060]  byte code like like sort of the Java way of like you can pile things down to it to a byte code where
[52:46.060 --> 52:52.180]  You can redeploy the same code across different platforms, right? Like in in a traditional
[52:52.820 --> 52:55.420]  Compiler you compile to a specific
[52:56.500 --> 52:59.380]  processor instruction set so if you were on
[53:00.400 --> 53:04.220]  You know an x86 chip your compiler generates
[53:04.900 --> 53:10.520]  x86 machine code that is directly it's the native language of the CPU
[53:10.520 --> 53:17.320]  It's a byte code and Java is probably the most famous example of this a Java compiler
[53:17.640 --> 53:20.080]  compiles to byte code and the byte code is
[53:21.120 --> 53:25.120]  It's low level, but it's the same byte code can run on
[53:25.960 --> 53:27.960]  it's say
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  Intel or power PC
[53:31.240 --> 53:33.880]  Right because it's interpreted by a virtual
[53:35.080 --> 53:36.680]  Right you
[53:36.680 --> 53:41.800]  You which is the runtime is the you know, when people ask you to install Java
[53:42.200 --> 53:47.040]  That's what they mean right that they need you to install the Java runtime so that they can interpret this code
[53:47.480 --> 53:50.520]  So my understanding from what they've said briefly
[53:51.880 --> 53:56.960]  was that your code would be compiled down into a Java like byte code and
[53:57.960 --> 53:59.440]  then
[53:59.440 --> 54:01.160]  recompiled by Apple
[54:01.160 --> 54:07.360]  With their latest compiler technology to target whatever the new devices they felt like um
[54:08.280 --> 54:13.920]  so this would enable stuff like like the CPU CPU on the watch to change or
[54:15.480 --> 54:21.520]  Like an iPad with an Intel processor because it would be dynamically recompiled when you tried to download it
[54:21.520 --> 54:29.560]  Um, that's not the case it did sound like I have to say that sounded like what they said when I saw the
[54:31.040 --> 54:37.680]  Well, that's what they said and I freaked out. I was like that because you know, I ship software
[54:37.680 --> 54:41.480]  I don't want my name attached to software that I haven't been able to test
[54:42.440 --> 54:44.440]  So that was kind of a big
[54:44.880 --> 54:46.880]  That was troublesome
[54:46.880 --> 54:50.800]  Um, what actually happens is that
[54:52.960 --> 54:56.440]  LLVM compiles your code down to bitcode
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.840]  Which is what they call it and I know it's confusing just bytes and bits and whatever
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.440]  But the bitcode that LLVM
[55:06.920 --> 55:08.920]  Emits is
[55:08.920 --> 55:16.480]  Very much targeted to the processor that you planted the point on and the only changes that
[55:17.520 --> 55:19.520]  Apple is going to make in this process are
[55:21.040 --> 55:26.600]  Quote provably correct and that gets hard to sort of explain
[55:29.840 --> 55:33.120]  If I'm doing something in the loop and at the beginning of the loop
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.700]  If I have to do something a hundred times and every time I have to write down
[55:37.700 --> 55:42.340]  five different things that never change and memorize them
[55:43.140 --> 55:44.940]  and
[55:44.940 --> 55:46.940]  Then go through the loop, you know
[55:46.940 --> 55:51.520]  Do all of the tasks I have to do and then do it again and then I have to write them all down again
[55:51.860 --> 55:59.260]  One optimization would be to well, why don't you just write them down once and use them every time through the loop now?
[56:00.460 --> 56:05.500]  Modern compilers can do that for you. They can reorder your code in order
[56:05.500 --> 56:07.500]  to achieve
[56:07.660 --> 56:11.540]  Like efficiencies in this way and then to compile your code faster
[56:11.920 --> 56:15.880]  Not to cry if those five things are that and you're saying in this case
[56:16.180 --> 56:20.260]  Those five things are exactly the same and have to be exactly the same
[56:20.260 --> 56:24.480]  You can prove that they'll be exactly the same all hundred times through the loop
[56:25.660 --> 56:29.660]  Well, okay. So there's two things. There's there's yes, there's that which is
[56:29.660 --> 56:36.020]  The basically that the optimization level of rebutting code it'll pull those out and we'll put them on
[56:36.820 --> 56:40.540]  top now the problem with that comes from is that if
[56:41.820 --> 56:47.540]  Okay, here are the stages I'm gonna ask you your name. I'm gonna ask you your you know
[56:47.660 --> 56:53.420]  Your family name and then I am going to write them down on a piece of paper. I'm gonna pass it to somebody else
[56:53.420 --> 56:55.420]  That's my iteration. Okay. Oh
[56:55.420 --> 57:02.300]  I'm gonna and I'll probably add a number to how many times I've done it so that each iteration is a little bit different now
[57:03.420 --> 57:09.800]  Ask you your name ask you your family name. I write them down. I'm doing that over and over and over now
[57:10.860 --> 57:12.860]  one day
[57:12.940 --> 57:15.820]  You're like, you know what John is a shitty name
[57:16.820 --> 57:19.680]  I'm gonna call myself guy because that's an awesome name
[57:19.680 --> 57:27.840]  And so now when I when I go through the loop, I've asked you your name and it's now guy Gruber and
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.800]  So the output you're making me feel weird
[57:32.720 --> 57:39.120]  Yeah, I know. That's a it's right. I'm trying to know in advanced compiler optimizations. No, there's a pretty good so
[57:40.200 --> 57:41.640]  so
[57:41.640 --> 57:43.880]  if you took those two
[57:43.880 --> 57:49.000]  Steps like asking you your name and your last name and took them out of the loop
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.440]  Most of the time you'd be totally correct, but there's a weird edge case word
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.520]  By analyzing the code. You can't necessarily tell that you're likely that you may change your name at some point
[58:01.320 --> 58:04.480]  Right, so that breaks code
[58:05.240 --> 58:06.640]  and
[58:06.640 --> 58:09.160]  that's the kind of optimization that happens with like
[58:09.160 --> 58:16.440]  O3 or O2 like that you set a flag about how much you want the code to be optimized
[58:16.560 --> 58:18.560]  When you compile these things
[58:18.600 --> 58:22.220]  Debug has no optimization so you can step through and see exactly what's happening
[58:22.520 --> 58:28.500]  at higher and higher levels of optimization the compiler gets smarter and smarter about doing this kind of thing, but
[58:30.040 --> 58:32.040]  The compiler is not always
[58:33.280 --> 58:36.160]  able to reason fully about your code and
[58:36.160 --> 58:38.160]  And
[58:38.360 --> 58:41.520]  Therefore can introduce some some bugs
[58:42.880 --> 58:46.680]  So that's why I was concerned you're saying with big code that cannot happen
[58:48.280 --> 58:49.520]  So
[58:49.520 --> 58:56.220]  Bitcode they're different there. They have already done that entire stage of trying to be smart and and moving
[58:56.960 --> 58:59.240]  You know rewriting the code in order to achieve
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.380]  Algorithmic and they've done that on your machine you'd the machine underneath your desk as a developer
[59:04.380 --> 59:11.560]  And so what what what you've gotten from Xcode on your machine you can test to your satisfaction
[59:13.280 --> 59:20.480]  Exactly, yeah now what bit code will allow Apple to do and I'm going to come up with a
[59:21.960 --> 59:25.240]  Similarly stupid example, um is that
[59:25.240 --> 59:32.800]  If you have I don't know like some operation is common like a multiplier operation
[59:34.520 --> 59:36.520]  Maybe there's a fast way to do it
[59:38.040 --> 59:43.480]  Like if you're only multiplying powers of well powers of two on a GPU on a CPU
[59:43.480 --> 59:46.020]  but if you're only multiplying powers of
[59:46.800 --> 59:51.640]  Ten like so it's ten and a hundred and all that all you have to do is add a bunch of zeros, right?
[59:51.640 --> 59:55.680]  Like what logically that's how you learn to do math. Um
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.080]  There can be a very fast way to do multiplication
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.480]  That this compiler can take advantage of
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.040]  Because it's it's being introduced as a new
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.680]  Called an intrinsic function like it's a new capability of the CPU
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.460]  Now a multiply is a multiply it doesn't matter if it happens fast or slow
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:24.220]  It's the same multiply the same order of operations applied like everything is fine
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:31.520]  whether they take a shortcut or they do the full-on multiply is you know is
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.480]  Something that is basically decision based on it that the CPU has to make
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:45.840]  And so Apple is basically reserving the right to change your code a little bit in order to better take advantage of these
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.720]  minute
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.720]  optimization right and so it's not as
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:56.320]  Has widely been speculated a way to future proof compiled code
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  for as yet
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800]  altogether new processors
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.800]  That's my understanding. Yeah, this would be as hard to target retarget to a new processor as taking assembly and
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.000]  targeting it to my processor and under the hood
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.320]  And so this article that was on this is getting way. No, but there's a widely cited article written by
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.840]  I don't even know who it is like this
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.560]  He goes here some here she goes by the name inertial lemon, and I don't know who this is
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.160]  but that this inertial lemon wrote an article that was sort of I
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.240]  Think we're saying that they're probably wrong that it's it's a good article. I recommend reading it
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320]  It's where I started with
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.200]  Until I spoke to people that that hadn't right and it's a little bit more magic
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.080]  Then then they can probably get away with and maybe even like from your perspective as a developer more magic
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.980]  Then you would be comfortable them trying to get away with
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.840]  well, so
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.680]  Ms. Lemon, I'm gonna I'm already forgetting last inertial name inertial lemon. I
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.360]  That's where I started I thought I was
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.400]  Yeah, they seem excited about the possibilities and it is it's exciting that you could retarget an application to a different platform
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.760]  on the other hand if somebody retargets my code to a different platform and
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.760]  I don't get to approve it
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.780]  And it's shipped under my name. I am gonna feel very uncomfortable with that now
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:35.740]  It turns out that's not what they're doing. They're they're they're doing small optimizations that can have
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:42.460]  Probably pretty small benefits, but in under certain certain conditions
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.580]  They're certainly worth doing so I'm you know, I'm excited about that
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.980]  What next so
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.380]  And this was cool to me and just as somebody who you know
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:02.780]  Majored in computer science used to think about computer science. It's like a purely computer sciency type thing is Apple unveiled a new
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:12.920]  Compression algorithm they're calling L Z F s e almost surprised me because Apple usually comes up with some kind of name for everything
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.180]  Yeah, but this is some hardcore yeah, and it's a replacement for
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.300]  well, I sort of a drop-in replacement for
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:28.540]  What was z lib or whatever but that it's it they've got different
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:34.260]  I mean, I don't know replacement is a weird thing like is alternative. It's an alternative. That's right. Yeah alternative
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.340]  Yeah, cuz they should like speed versus compression factor
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.840]  And it's way faster than z lib
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.060]  remembering the talk correctly and
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.180]  Compresses better too, right? So yeah, and
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.980]  And but the only thing that they didn't unveil about this
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:58.020]  They didn't say anything about it being open-sourced and I'm guessing that they probably will but they just didn't want to say anything right now
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.220]  Because they're not they're not ready. But who knows?
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.300]  Well, like you said I think this is like serious comp side nerd
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:10.580]  Territory. Yeah, if they don't open and so I said that I there's gonna be a paper on it like you
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.700]  Yeah, it just seems to me like even if they've you know, I
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.420]  Can't see why they wouldn't open source it
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.100]  I mean the only thing I can think of is if there's some part of it that they've patented but
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.220]  even so it's like to me it would be better for Apple if they
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.780]  It would be more in Apple's interest to have this as widely used as possible
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.980]  Assuming everything they say about it is as good that it has the tight compression that you want
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.540]  But it's like three times faster than z lib or whatever
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.700]  They would but you you can patent something and still describe the other right?
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:47.100]  Like that's kind of the kind of the point right you can even uh, like gif existed like that for I
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.500]  mean
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:55.260]  You'd know better than I would like for 20 years seems like before the patent expired
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:55.540]  Yeah
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:01.700]  The problem with gif the unisys owned the patent on gif and it was like that they didn't enforce it
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.780]  They had a patent on it didn't enforce it then the web. Yeah, they did the submarine, right?
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.740]  And it was like all of a sudden on the web. Everybody was using it and then somebody at unisys realized
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.940]  Hey, we own a patent on this and then you know
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:19.460]  Everybody sort of yeah, it was specifically if I remember correctly the LZW. Yeah, I I think
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.980]  Very much in the family of things that we're talking right
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:27.160]  I think what they could do at Apple could do or some anybody could do and I think other people have done is you can
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.420]  Patent it and say this is an Apple patent, but then they can they can bestow that patent
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.820]  You know, they can say this is open to the world and you know and Lee
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:40.980]  Yeah, once you have the patent is that you're the boss, but they could like like you can license it free right in it
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.620]  You did it legally binding you determine the licensing terms. So, you know
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:53.460]  If the terms are everybody can use it then everybody can use it that's fine, but I don't see that this is not a
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:59.440]  This is not a major benefit to Apple. This is not gonna it'd be more of a better anymore iPhones
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.900]  This is gonna sell zero more
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.740]  Right, it would be more of a benefit to Apple if everybody else started using it even you know
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.220]  So like Google servers were using it
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:16.180]  Amazon servers were using it or other, you know startups, you know people with web services could deploy it anywhere from anywhere
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500]  so that iPhones
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:26.580]  Receiving these you know this stuff over the air could take advantage of this and have tighter compression and you know less CPU intensive
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:36.260]  Decompression of the compressed up and one and one thing they pointed out was that a lot of the compression algorithms that we use today
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:41.260]  Would develop 20 30 years ago and CPUs looked very different back, right?
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:46.400]  So creating a modern one that takes full advantage of you know modern
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.380]  Instruction sets and the ability to work on a lot of data with
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:56.940]  Man we're getting into the nerd weeds on this one, but
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:04.060]  There's methods to work with a lot of data with very few instructions and the CPU can just optimize that. Yeah
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.560]  Well, I yeah, we don't have to say much more about it
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.660]  But I do say I still think it's an interesting thing to be coming out of I'm not surprised
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:13.960]  But it's it's an interesting just pure computer science when to come out of Apple
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:18.220]  Yeah, one thing I did want to mention about this is what I mentioned to you while we were
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.260]  Kind of chatting about this before the show. I
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:28.820]  See FaceTime as the open source exception rather than they're really pretty good about releasing stuff that they said they're gonna be
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.140]  Oh, yeah
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:36.060]  But if people remember that though the famous one day when they held FaceTime and and Steve Jobs said and it's gonna be open
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:39.620]  You know an industry standard we're gonna you know, we're gonna tomorrow morning
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.140]  We're gonna send this to all the industry standard, you know
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:47.740]  The standard committees and blah blah blah and so whenever Apple says anything's gonna be open people are like, yeah
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:52.260]  I'll still hold my breath on FaceTime, but FaceTime is definitely the exception, you know
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.620]  yeah, and I've said this before but
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.980]  I'll say it on your show. I
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:04.260]  Went out to a party with the FaceTime guys the day it was announced and they had no idea
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:11.060]  They were like what the fuck happened there. We don't know and I've since heard from people that would know
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.780]  that
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.780]  Steve asked somebody
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:22.340]  Can we open sources and they just came back with sure and they didn't really check with the team
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.460]  Like whoever gave the answer wasn't mentioned. Yeah
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.260]  like the manager and the entire team was sitting in the audience and they're like
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:34.680]  When they heard they was gonna be open source, they they were as shocked as we were probably more so
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:42.220]  So anyway, yeah and plus in the interim everybody but it's not that's not some kind of weird Machiavellian thing
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:48.340]  That's just a complete fuck-up through lack of a better expression and it's sort of you know, it's
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.660]  you know, you got to take the good with the bad with Steve Jobs where he can be impetuous and impulsive and
[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.860]  Sometimes that works to your advantage and sometimes it doesn't
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:01.660]  Right. I get the impression that it was just like sure Steve
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:08.380]  and they had all sorts of other problems with that too where they had like a patent lawsuit and and there was a time I
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.620]  might be
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.980]  Yada yada yada in some of stuff in the middle, but some of this there were problems, you know from when FaceTime
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.740]  debuted to where we are today where because of a patent lawsuit they had to unroll some stuff and
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.900]  It made it let work less
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:23.160]  well
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:28.660]  and there were some you know drop calls and stuff like that it got worse for a while before it got better because they had
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.660]  To take out some stuff because of a patent lawsuit
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.420]  obviously
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:37.740]  That would have been a problem if they'd opened if they had just just quote unquote open source the original thing anyway
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.060]  Yeah, you don't just decide to open-source something like that there's
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:46.780]  Technical and legal reasons that you know, that's not me. All right, so next big topic
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:52.380]  We've got watch kit 2.0 which is seriously a major major major difference
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:59.340]  So watch kit as we know it with what they unveiled last November what every single watch app in the App Store today is
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:03.100]  is code that runs on your phone and
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.140]  Projects a UI on to the watch
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:12.060]  And watch kit 2.0 as promised by Jeff Williams a month or so ago
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.060]  Is native native native code that can run on on the watch?
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:27.020]  1.0 still works, which is nice and might be good for some uses, you know, I asked yeah
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:31.740]  Schiller about that last week and there might be some apps that don't even need to run natively if they run natively
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:36.940]  If they really do just need occasional status updates, why even bother with it?
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:44.900]  So I do think that watch kit was sort of the that was the big thing right like we've got a whole new platform
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.060]  Yeah, I think so. Um
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.460]  What I was surprised about
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:59.420]  Um was just exactly how much access we got to it because we get we all
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.900]  expected apps, right, um
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.100]  But we get a lot more we get complications notifications glances and apps I
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.140]  Really did not think that
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:14.380]  We as third-party developers would be afforded
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:21.180]  Access to the complications machinery. I always expected that we would be eventually but I thought that would be a next year thing
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:28.220]  Well eventually sure but as I get I know it's called watch kid 2.0
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:31.480]  But I'm whatever I'm gonna call it like a first release of native
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:36.160]  Yeah, and Apple would never use a version number like this but more or less like what we had
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:40.860]  With the current, you know watch kit is sort of like watch kit 0.1
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:44.980]  I'm surprised that they called it watch cam still
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.740]  It seems like watch kit could have been that weird bluetooth thing and then I
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.220]  don't know watch SDK could have been I
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.660]  Don't know but here's the interesting thing
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:05.380]  You still need to have an iPhone app in order to have a watch app. You cannot sell watch apps directly
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.660]  They need to be a complement to your iPhone app
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:13.280]  And what that means is, you know probably lost to the muddy
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:18.660]  Vegas or app approval like can you just have a screen that comes up and say hey check your watch
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.840]  probably not
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.280]  But what watch get 2.0 is is
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.240]  Remarkably robust and
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.800]  forward-looking
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:40.060]  especially compared to how we saw at the launch of yeah, I one of my go-to moves during
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.320]  WWDC is when I run into somebody I haven't seen him at all. Somebody I know it's just asked him, you know, and
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.360]  Especially this week. I just had last week. I had you know while I was there
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360]  I had more meetings and stuff outside
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.480]  Moscone than usual almost every day. I had something going on and I really I didn't make it to any sessions at all
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.000]  All week long so I was woefully under informed even compared to usual
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.280]  So I just asked people like tell me something cool you learned this week and you know
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.520]  What's your take and I kept hearing over and over from people that who were surprised who were like?
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.080]  I knew they were gonna that they said we're gonna get native watch apps. I can't believe how
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:21.420]  How much they've exposed to watch apps already, you know, even knowing that we're gonna have something quote-unquote native running on the app
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.680]  People are you know developers are very surprised at how much there is
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.960]  I'm shocked
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.720]  You know not to
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.140]  Whatever not not to be too nice to you
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:41.400]  But I did like that you brought up the watch kid 1.0 period to to fill
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:47.080]  I'm calling him fill his days to peed on you to give me all these compliments, isn't it?
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.180]  Yeah, it really is
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.260]  I mean usually have me on the show and I like you want me to be addicted you that's like
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:56.260]  like like when we disagree with something you want me to it's I
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.740]  I
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.580]  You did a good job. I texted Dalrymple today
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:05.980]  We were I forget what we were texting about but I told him that it killed me to admit publicly how good he looks
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:11.740]  It was painful thing I've written on Daring Fireball all year
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:19.180]  I don't want to mess with him now. Uh, you know what we gotta buy him along with beer
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:25.980]  And so here's an interesting thing. So complications. Everybody is excited that there's a really good complications API
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:32.020]  and that third-party apps can add complications to all these faces it is a
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.860]  Fascinating design challenge. I was talking to the guys
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.460]  my friends who work at MLB comm and they do the MLB app and
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:45.260]  They were like they heard about this they were they were just like us
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.980]  They were surprised that they were gonna get it and then they immediately started plotting what they were gonna do and for most of these
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:57.540]  Complications you're so limited in space and how much size it's like like their first thought was that you could pick a favorite team
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.860]  And then you'd have a complication that while the game is going on would show you the score
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:08.380]  But they for most of the sizes of complications they there's I don't maybe they figured it out by now
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.780]  But at least last week they still hadn't figured out how to do it because you can't use color
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.140]  because the colors come from the
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.660]  The settings yeah
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.300]  So you can't like say the Yankees are blue and the Phillies are red and indicate it with dots that way or something like that
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:31.420]  You have to it has to be without using color to indicate that and there's so little space that you you know
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:37.280]  It's it's really it's gonna be a great design challenge in terms of like constraints being you know
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.200]  Forcing you to be super creative
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.600]  Yeah, I agree, um just as a
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160]  bit of backstory, I
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.680]  Know you bring up the MLB guys a lot, but it's not just yours love for baseball. Those guys do an amazing job
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.880]  Like we've had lunch. Well, I mean I've joined you for lunch a couple of
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.560]  You don't even know the rules of baseball and you have a I don't know the rules
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.440]  You have a good time guys are talking to those guys awesome to talk to they are amazing to talk to like it's like they
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:16.040]  Are very very smart guys and they all love baseball and they're not jackasses when I'm like
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.360]  So do you swing the bat this way?
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Batting a thousand is that that's a hundred percent, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.560]  But they are killing it in terms of technology
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:37.520]  Like you're killing it. I think I'm correct in that their back end is the one that's powering a bunch of other
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.120]  Yeah, their video back end does all of the WWE stuff
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.560]  And the HBO now they're not doing HBO go HBO go is still the old HBO back end
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.200]  The new stuff is yeah, and I think I think the new stuff is probably more popular
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.800]  Yeah, and I mean just wrap your head around that MLB is a major
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:07.400]  Technology, that's crazy. Well think about this like they deserve it because those guys are smart right and last year with HBO go
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:14.640]  when Game of Thrones the you know last year's season of Game of Thrones came out their servers crapped out and they had to say
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.640]  stuff like
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.320]  We know it's Sunday night and there's a new episode of Game of Thrones if you want to watch it on game on HBO go
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.320]  Why don't you wait a day or two?
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.360]  And there was none of that this year with the HBO now
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.360]  And it's like one of those things people just you know
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.840]  when when your online stuff fails everybody talks about it and when it works perfectly everybody just
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.280]  assumes that it was supposed to be but they the
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.920]  MLB
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.360]  Com back to HBO now stuff with Game of Thrones just just worked and everybody if you wanted to watch yeah
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360]  No, you could watch Sunday night
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.840]  Yeah, anyway, I just wanted to step out a bit there and sing their praises because those guys are not dummies
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.840]  but you know
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.680]  Complications on the watch seemed perfect for that. I don't get I can't even tell you how many times I've been hanging out with you
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.680]  and you like
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.920]  Just dodge the conversation. Check out what's going on with the game
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:17.640]  That'd be great. And the way complications work is pretty cool in that you provide a timeline, right?
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.960]  obviously, that's not gonna work for a game because you can't predict the future but
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.920]  for you know
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:31.640]  Stuff like weather or upcoming events you can provide a timeline and then when you start dying the digital crown
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.640]  You get to see into the future
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.920]  I
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.720]  Haven't tried the beta because I don't want to put on my regular watch
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.960]  and you still have your
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:47.460]  You know the review, you know watch I thought about that I do I was getting ready to send it back
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:52.200]  And now I'm wondering whether maybe I should keep it a couple weeks so I can put 2.0 on it
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.440]  Yeah, but to know really that's going in the garbage and that they're gonna incinerate that thing because I wore it
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.320]  Yeah, probably they don't want that
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.480]  Plastic gloves is gonna put that in the ziplock bag and it's going I think like a lot of people while I was watching the
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.480]  keynote and they said okay and now we've got this timeline interface for
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:18.100]  Complications and you spin the digital crown that go forward or backward in time and it'll show you you know
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.100]  Like so if you have the temperature
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.840]  obviously, they're not gonna be able to show you the future temperature, but you can go back in time and
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.820]  See the previous temperature or the joke that they made that the stock
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.060]  You know, right this talk
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:35.500]  It does not go into the future but you can go into the past and see the stock moving throughout the day as the hours
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:40.940]  You know a change on your on your hand. I like I'm sure a lot of people I immediately thought well
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.660]  What the hell happens now when I spin the crown on my watch and I went and spun the crown and of course nothing happens
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:51.940]  Well, it depends on the astronomy and I believe the Sun. Yeah the solar one
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:54.340]  So the one yeah
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:58.380]  You can do that. You can spin the thing and it shows you what happens
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:01.780]  But that those are two faces where you don't get to customize the complications
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:08.460]  Right, and it makes me wonder maybe because that might be why you didn't get to customize the complications
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.900]  because
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.900]  they didn't want to have
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.740]  That hadn't yeah, so it makes me wonder whether in the you know
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.160]  2.0 what maybe they'll add some minor complications to like the solar face because
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.220]  Those will update too as you spin the crown
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.540]  Well, we'll have to ask your friend. Yeah, we'll have to see but I thought that was pretty cool
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:39.260]  And I think that's pretty cool use and in hindsight, it seems pretty obvious that that was going to come to everything
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.020]  I feel like I should have been able to predict that because why else is that?
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.740]  You know, why should spinning the crown be a no op?
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.300]  Yeah, I also had a dummy moment. There was like well, of course
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.900]  Well, I mean they killed it I think that's a great
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:03.220]  Just seeing what you when your next UI UI when your next calendar appointment is is amazing
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:12.380]  And not only that there's the tactile field of is it coming soon in that you move the digital crown very little
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.860]  or is it a while where you have to
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.220]  spin it a bit, you know, I mean there there's a
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.260]  It's like scrolling to the top of the page
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:28.480]  This is like scrolling a couple lines up. You have a note in here. It says foreground discouraged background preferred. What does that mean? Oh
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.760]  This is something transit to me
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160]  When we were doing like a debug
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.600]  WWDC to recap
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:48.240]  Originally on the phone you could not do anything in the background
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:54.760]  When your app was not on screen you were dead to the world you weren't running you were expected to launch quickly and
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.640]  Get back to what you were doing
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:01.200]  but you weren't running and then when the user hit the home button to go to another app you had like a
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:08.080]  Second or two or that CPU would let you clean up and then once that time was over you were you're cut off whether you
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.640]  Were done cleaning. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the OS says okay, you're done and it it
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:20.440]  one of the things I love about iOS is that it is not a fate to just kill processes like
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:26.920]  It'll tell you you've got to clean up and they'll kill you right. Where is the the classic Unix mindset?
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:32.680]  The true Unix mindset is to go to extraordinary lengths to keep all processes running
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.600]  like the whole system can be out of RAM and
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.240]  It'll it'll start scrolling
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:46.680]  And going to using the disk and swapping memory out to this to extraordinary lengths to the to the length where it'll really slow
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.320]  Everything to a crawl but technically everything is still running and iOS
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.400]  it'll spend like half an hour trying to figure this out how to get some swap space for you, but
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.760]  The Mac does that now if you try running low on disk space bad things will happen
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.680]  But iOS no, I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think it's a bad thing
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:11.640]  But iOS no, they'll just kill you. Right, so I you know
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:17.800]  And so you're saying that the or Drance's observation is that the watch is different where it actually prefers that you do stuff in the background
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:24.200]  well in the it's not that it processes are necessarily running in the background, but in the you
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.040]  Schedule a bunch of complication
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.880]  events
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.120]  Provide them to the API and then go away
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.000]  So as you're turning that dial your process is not involved in
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.960]  Telling the watch what comes next
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.560]  If you've given it 20 or 50 or 100 events in advance
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.000]  When the when the time travel dial when the digital crown is is turned
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.800]  Your application will never be woken up
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.080]  All of the information that is required to present that
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:11.200]  Your data on screen has already been given to the app and it won't bother you
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:16.560]  So in a way it's more like you provide data and
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.200]  Times to the to the watch and it decides what to do with them
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.640]  Rather than the phone which originally had a very unique
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.120]  sort of interaction model
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.840]  Does that make sense I'm sure Matt can explain it better
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.760]  I do think so. I know what you mean though
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:44.720]  It's like you're supposed to to keep your complication going you just schedule like and you know, it obviously it could be abused
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.960]  Well, I mean so here's the difference is like
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.800]  you and I trying to schedule the show and
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.080]  You keep asking me like hey
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:01.520]  You're free now. Hey free now. Hey free now if you or I'm like look these are the blocks of time
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.520]  I'm not free and this is when I am free
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:09.280]  And you can go away and work with that information work it around your schedule and then come back with like well, okay
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.280]  here's a
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.800]  Here's the time it works for both of us. Yeah, right like the
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.600]  That's kind of what the complications on the watch are doing in that you provide them with a timeline of events and data
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.720]  Rather than the watch asking you persistently
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:31.760]  So you as as the application asking the application persistently to provide new information
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:39.680]  It asks the application up front for a list of events and and time and there's this new
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.640]  They call it a high priority notification
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.560]  Where if it comes into your phone and you mark it as high priority
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.800]  It'll go to the watch right away. And I was thinking that's perfect for something like a sports app like the mlb app
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.280]  With scores like if you say I want to have scores on my watch, you know for the yankees
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.800]  It can be it seems to me like it can be really smart and it knows well the game hasn't even started yet
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.560]  The game doesn't start till seven o'clock at night
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:10.000]  So we'll just all you need to know is that there's a game starting at seven o'clock and then the complication can just say
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.600]  Something, you know, so you know, it's not a game. It's not a game
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.440]  The complication can just say something, you know, 705 pm
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.640]  Miami marlins, that's who the yankees are playing tonight
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.400]  um, and then once the game starts they can just wait for the
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.860]  Every time the score changes send a high priority notification
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.040]  And then the watch would be up to date pretty much as soon as the notification hits your iphone
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.200]  And it doesn't need to pull on a regular basis
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:41.280]  It can just wait for this, you know for their a you know, the watch or the phone app to get those notifications
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.360]  That'll only happen when the score changes
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.840]  Right, and so two things here first, uh
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:53.120]  notifications no longer need to be entirely presented to the user they can just go to the
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.840]  right
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.880]  second
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.140]  I love that. You think that a yankees score change is a high priority notification
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.600]  Well, this is another where see this is where it pays to be a fan of uh soccer
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.680]  Corner because then you only have to get one note. You only have to get one notification per game since they all end one zero
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.880]  That's true. I can't argue with that
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:22.320]  Okay, let's get man. Uh icloud kid. I cloud web services. That's kind of pretty surprising to me
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.360]  So the gist of the gist of that seems to be I didn't see the session
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.000]  but I only saw the the highlight of it, uh in the the
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.560]  state of the union but that now they're going to have a set of api so that a web app can use icloud for
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.920]  uh
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.680]  user id and pretty much get the same data out of it that uh
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.480]  that the native apps can
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.280]  Yeah, that is kind of remarkable, um
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.360]  Again, I haven't looked into it that much because web stuff is not my forte. Uh
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.180]  It seemed from this the slide and what they said that you could use it for authentication
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:07.060]  Would you guys at cube branch have used it for desperate login? Uh, because I know and I don't probably
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.660]  I mean it would have ruled us think i'm blowing anything because we kind of
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.500]  That's if i'm not wrong that came up in like the beta glass motor and you considered twitter and facebook
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:22.340]  And the reason we turn those is that cool to say it because no you can say that we thought about it
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.300]  I think I don't know if i've talked about this publicly or not, but there's nothing secret about it
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:28.100]  We definitely thought about it because we didn't want to write our own uh,
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:34.500]  authentication system because it's every moment that we that we spent writing an authentication system was a moment
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.980]  We weren't writing cool features that were specific to vesper
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:41.540]  But the problem we found when we asked friends and family normal people
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:50.100]  And not not like people who are developers and know hey, yeah writing your own authentication system is a pain in the ass
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:56.500]  Is that a lot of normal people really hate signing in with twitter or facebook because they don't know
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:02.020]  what's going on with twitter or facebook because like let's say they they just want to use a notes app and they think
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:08.340]  And I think reasonably so they think hey, I don't want to use my facebook because I don't want my facebook getting
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:12.260]  Messed up with these notes. I don't want facebook posting something from my notes
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.740]  I don't want I just want to keep them separate people
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:21.060]  Don't really understand where one thing blurs with another but they they know if they never even sign in to this
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:25.700]  Notes app with facebook then they can never get intertwined
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:30.260]  Right and people are just uncomfortable that people don't like doing it people like having
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:35.540]  I know it sounds like it sounds counterintuitive because everybody knows it's a problem to have
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:40.180]  75 different user accounts that you're active using and you have you know
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:45.460]  You're supposed to use a different password with each one and so developers think oh i'll solve this
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:50.500]  We'll just use you know facebook as your login and then you can just use the account you already know
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:57.060]  But the truth is that people are uncomfortable with that because they don't want facebook getting mixed up with these other services
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.700]  You know what i've never signed in with the facebook to anything. I still don't have a facebook account
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.020]  Yeah
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:11.060]  But I know I do just for the sake of like I worry about it when I use twitter to sign into something else
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:13.780]  Though because i've I don't think i've ever gotten burned by this
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:19.060]  but I know there are stupid things where you can like sign in with twitter and you're not really paying attention and then
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:25.140]  They automatically tweet to your account. Uh, i'm using blah blah blah and you know, there's a oh
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:31.300]  I've had that happen, you know hated it. I had to apologize like publicly like oh it was uh
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:37.700]  Act on it. Yeah, maybe and I think I I think and I think the only reason I avoided that was that I was
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:43.220]  Late to it and I had a bunch of friends who got burned by it. And so I knew not to yeah, yeah
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:48.500]  Yeah, but by and large i'd rather sign in with my twitter account. I mean
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:55.540]  I very rarely use facebook but in theory that's got a lot of personal information on me
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.780]  twitter is
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.280]  like
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.500]  99%
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:02.500]  Me being a jackass in public
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:07.540]  Like I realized that everything I put into twitter is pretty much going to be public
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:09.780]  uh
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.860]  Dms, I expect to be private. But I mean honestly if that
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.660]  Failed, it wouldn't be that bad
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.300]  um
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:20.980]  But
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:26.340]  If your app required a facebook login, I'd probably I mean that'd do it because it's you but I would be
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.980]  reticent to do it if I
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:33.940]  Because I have no idea what that would mean. So even as a developer, I don't know. I have no idea and
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:39.060]  I don't know if that can change in the future either, right? So well anyway, I
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:42.660]  I we might have been a lot more likely to use iCloud than
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:46.900]  anything else and we even thought about ways to use iCloud in a way that you know
[01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:51.300]  The even if we weren't using iCloud for the data just using it as
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:54.740]  Authentication having a token or something like that and there's ways you could do that
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.340]  I think having the web service api
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.900]  It certainly makes it more interesting and more likely that we would have used it or that we might in the future or something
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:02.420]  like that
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.420]  Yeah, I think that's a good step. Uh
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.940]  Do you want to just start tearing? Yeah, we can start but let me take a break
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.500]  I have two more sponsors to thanks. So let me get let me knock one out and here's our it's our good friends at
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:20.340]  Hover now, you got you know, hover hover is yeah, I just I I just bought a domain for them three days ago. Well
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:23.460]  Good for you
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:25.760]  Hover
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.900]  Coobersocks.com
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.540]  That's the best way to register and manage
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:35.940]  Domain names in the world. They take all the hassle and confusion out of registering and managing your domain names
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:38.420]  They give you easy to use tools to manage them
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:44.340]  Uh, and you don't need to be like a dns expert to do it. Anyone can do it. They explain everything
[01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:50.100]  Uh, and you'll be really comfortable figuring out yourself. Their support team is always ready if you need a hand
[01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:57.220]  Takes five minutes from from finding the domain name, uh finding, you know, they have tools
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.340]  So if the one you want is taken they make really smart suggestions about how you can fill it in with you know
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:08.920]  Get maybe use a different top-level domain maybe tweak the actual domain you're wanting slightly to get one that's available
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:15.220]  If you've ever registered domain names somewhere else hover is like the difference between night and day
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:20.900]  Most other domain name registrars it's like going into the bad part of town and you feel like you got to keep your hand on
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:27.620]  Your wallet, uh, you got to look, you know for checkboxes where they're automatically upgrading you to stuff. You have to opt out of stuff
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.180]  um, they they
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:33.620]  Charge you more they seem like they're charging you these great prices
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:36.920]  But if you want something like privacy for your personal information
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:42.980]  Uh on the domain name registration, you have to pay extra all of that you get that for free with hover
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:46.100]  It's all built in and they have the most amazing thing
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:52.100]  I still think it still sounds too good to be true, but it's not is they call it valet transfer service. It's free
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:59.220]  It's built into the to the price of being a hover customer. So you've got domain names. You've already registered from years ago
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.220]  Uh at other
[01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:03.220]  At other registrars you sign up for hover
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:08.660]  You see for yourself that yes, this is the place. This is the best place for domain names that i've seen
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.060]  You think I wish all my old domains were here
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:14.260]  Well use their free valet transfer service you get in contact with them
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:17.940]  You give them the information to go to your old registrars wherever you have the domains
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:25.860]  Uh, and they go and move them all to hover for you. They just go through all the hassles and uh,
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.180]  As as our friend merlin man has said in his reads for hover on on shows
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.740]  A lot of these other registrars they purposefully make it pretty hard to to move your domains
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.700]  It's sort of like calling up to cancel your cable service
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:44.580]  They don't they and hover knows all the tricks. They know everything they need to do to get that working
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:53.700]  So great interface great management tools great tools for registering new domains and free valet transfer service
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:59.700]  What more do you need to hear? Uh, here's the deal. They have a special code just for listeners of the show you get ten percent
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:01.300]  off
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:04.420]  Your first purchase go to hover.com and here's the code now they do
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.820]  per episode
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:12.020]  Codes so their code for today's show this show is el capitan
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.620]  All one word close it up. No space el capitan
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:22.420]  And uh, they'll know you came from this episode of the show and you'll save money doing it. So my thanks to hover
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.420]  Thanks to hover
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.500]  great sponsor
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.820]  Yeah, they're good also
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:34.900]  Please use that code because that means that they'll know that you like me more than phil sheller
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:40.020]  And that'll mean a lot. Oh, man. What else do we have to tear through here?
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:44.660]  Uh swift is swift too. We got it. We got man. We're like halfway down this right?
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.300]  but yeah swift 2 uh
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.900]  Uh, I don't know do you want to set the stage for this one?
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:58.340]  I think swift is doing great. I think the fact that it's as popular as it is one year in is fantastic
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:03.940]  But almost nobody is using it yet as like their main language. It's just it's not reason
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:11.380]  It's not it's not it's not that's not a failure. It's just it's the side effect of apple releasing it as early as they did to get feedback
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:16.100]  I agree, uh, I think if apple were a different company this would be
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:23.380]  What they're now calling swift 1.0 would have been swift 0.x and swift 2 would have been swift 1.0
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:29.460]  Because I really think that they've turned but the difference is is that what you know this year swift
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.820]  They're calling it 2.0. Call it the real 1.0 if you want to
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.580]  Is informed by a year's worth of feedback from actual developers?
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:44.660]  And yes, I mean when swift 1 came out when swift first came out there were some bananas stuff there
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.260]  You could mutate arrays in ways that would make
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:52.100]  No sense according to the to what you would expect from swift
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:59.460]  like if you copied array b into array a and then changed something in main
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:03.860]  In array b, it would also be changed inside array a
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:11.540]  Probably lost like 20 million of your listeners there, but basically it would be like if you know
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:20.340]  Spooky action at a distance like you would you would you would change one thing in one place and it would affect something in some other place
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.100]  And that makes it really hard to reason about how programs work
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.180]  They fix that they've been improving the syntax and
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:33.380]  With 2.0. I really think that they've kind of turned a corner and I think it's definitely worth
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.780]  considering
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.500]  Adopting for for new code. Yeah, the big one
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:45.700]  A big addition this isn't this isn't something they had to like revisit. It's something that they really didn't even talk about until
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.620]  Until now is error handling
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:51.940]  Right
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:53.940]  So I think that's a really good point
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:59.540]  Is error handling right? And it looks good to me
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.420]  I mean, but my perspective on this is certainly a layman's perspective at this point, but it looks good to me
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.420]  In terms, you know, it's what are they calling it? Try catch. It's
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:16.420]  Well, yeah, it's do try and then catch but and you know what you being too humble
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.540]  Playgrounds have marked. I know it's pretty cool
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:25.300]  Yeah, good on you, man. That's yeah. No, I know you're laughing. But no, it's I'm blown away by that
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:31.700]  I never really thought that anything I wrote would would make it into Apple's developer tools. Oh, I'm sure not if your code is no
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.700]  No, no, definitely not
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.500]  But the ideas are which is yeah, well, that's bad. The ideas were the best part
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:44.020]  Yeah, so error handling you create a block and then you
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:48.020]  API's that can
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:56.020]  They're calling it throw that can return an error or throw an error in Swift language
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:05.380]  You put try in front of them and then you can basically catch those errors and process them accordingly
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:12.820]  I'm trying to come up with it with a way to describe this but it's almost like if
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:18.820]  every every time you tried something if something went wrong you would
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.580]  Not follow the rest of the steps in the recipe instead you would just go to
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:32.180]  The the case where you clean everything up and you you wipe down the kitchen and you just say like that didn't work
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:37.220]  Um, so they've made kind of a pretty nice way I think of handling
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:42.180]  Yeah, and some of it and I think I forget i'm stealing this from somebody when we were out there last week
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:46.740]  But somebody when we were I don't know hanging out at drinking in the park 55 or something
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:51.540]  Somebody mentioned that some of this stuff is not really for the compiler
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.660]  Some of it is like the syntax is really for the programmer to know. Hey
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:00.980]  You know llvm can figure out could could figure out some of this without the syntax
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:03.620]  But the syntax is there so that when you're reading the code
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:06.900]  You the programmer are like, oh this could throw an error
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:12.260]  I totally agree. Um, I might not get to the next line like it's it's you know, here's this
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:15.540]  Here's this method called to open the document
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:21.700]  I might not get to the next line because I I can see right here that this might throw an error and the error might
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:25.700]  Be well, the document isn't even there anymore or something, you know, you don't even know but it's gonna you know
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:31.220]  The flow is going to change and then here's where it's going to go if it throws an error and I can see where my you
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:34.820]  Know, you know, what are the what do I do if something unexpected happens?
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.820]  Exactly
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:44.100]  Let's take you up open document example, um
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.300]  The compiler knows that open document
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.100]  May
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.100]  Return with an error may throw an error
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:56.020]  You don't need to put try in front of it to appease the compiler
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.980]  you could just say open document and
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:03.700]  The compiler would be totally happy being like oh that failed so i'm going to go down here
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.460]  but by
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.620]  requiring the use of the keyword try
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:15.140]  You are forcing the programmer to reason about the way that the code flow may change
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.780]  So
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:25.460]  A lot I I do one of the things that concerns me about swift is that uh,
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:30.580]  There's a lot of ornamentation decoration that is in order to appease the compiler
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.700]  Or to present the compiler with better options
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:41.220]  In order to produce faster code rather than uh, preferring more readable code
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.140]  That said this this try construct, uh, I I think
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:50.900]  it favors the uh, favors the programmer and
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.620]  More so favors the person that comes back and tries to understand that code, right?
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:59.620]  Maybe you didn't six months maybe or maybe you didn't write it in the first place or
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:04.660]  For me personally any any code i've ever written six months later. It's I might as well have been written by somebody else
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.620]  Yeah, well you've read a lot of edgics. So
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:14.020]  That's awful. Well, that's what comments are for. That's that to me is where yeah, and you know to be fair
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.140]  You've you've i've seen some of it and you've commented very well
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:22.740]  that's to me is the secret to to me the secret to programming it was to when I when the breakthrough for me was to
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:27.220]  Realize that comments aren't for other people comments are for yourself in a few months. Yeah
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:31.700]  Yeah, explain to my future self exactly what the hell you were thinking when you wrote this, right?
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.060]  Yeah, the zen of programming is realize that you're not that smart
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:40.820]  just you know realize that you're the dummy that you're looking down on right now and just
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.340]  Become comfortable. All right metal on the mac
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.980]  Metal on the mac, uh, very cool. Um, so
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.020]  Metal was introduced last year on ios
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.620]  It had the advantage that um
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:59.780]  The gpu and cpu were integrated on the same chip and they shared the same memory
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:05.620]  On the mac, that's not the case like the mac pro has a distinct
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.660]  Discrete graphics cards, uh ati i'm gonna forget the part number but
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:20.820]  Some mac pros have that too. They've got the integrated graphics and then they can like ramp up to to having discrete
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:28.260]  gpu's kick in um, so metal on the mac brings a very low level approach to graphics programming
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:33.700]  From ios to the mac, um
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.380]  Directx 12 has been doing this ati's mantle
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.220]  Api has been doing this
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:47.780]  I think in the time in the big picture. I feel like there's a couple of factors
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:52.980]  I think one of them is that apple it it they're they're custom silicon teams, you know, call it all
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:58.580]  You know bob mansfeld stuff, but they're doing amazing graphics stuff on ios on the mac
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.260]  They're still doing you know, they're using ati and what nvidia
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:09.780]  Graphics cards that could shift at some point right like they could start doing their own graphics chips for the mac
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.700]  maybe
[01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:12.740]  but
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.860]  Laying the ground. Yeah for the mac. Yeah. Yeah laying the ground
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.980]  Work now with metal would make that sort of transition
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.820]  A couple of years from now a lot easier if in the few, you know
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.940]  If in a couple of years all anything graphic intensive of mac is assumed to be written to metal
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:31.860]  So there's a hardware angle here
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:33.860]  I
[01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:35.860]  Yeah, all right. I could be wrong
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:40.260]  No, you know i'm often wrong i'm over my head on this the other
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:46.420]  The other thing and I i've i'm not no I made the mistake last week could be right but but here's the thing with opengl
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.420]  It runs on everything
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:54.900]  Uh opengl ran on os2 windows 16 windows 32 sgi
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.420]  It's
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:03.700]  Opengl if you want that kind of cross-platform thing opengl is the way you do it. Um
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.900]  interfaces like metal
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.180]  metal and directx 12 are
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:16.100]  A new way of reasoning about the gpu originally the gpu used to be about
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:22.660]  You would submit some triangles you would set some state in order to you know, like
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:27.720]  This is the color you're going to draw. This is the texture you're going to map onto these triangles
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.660]  And then you would put them on the screen
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.660]  These days the gpu has got
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:38.340]  These days the gpu has got so fast and so
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:44.260]  Capable of just tearing through huge amounts of data
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:49.940]  That the best way to address it is not in this piecemeal fashion, but rather to
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.580]  basically write out a command stream, um
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.460]  and a command stream is
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:57.380]  uh
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:04.660]  I'm sure maybe the more technical people in your audience will disagree with me, but it's effectively a program. Uh,
[01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.460]  there's no loops or if statements but but it's like
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:14.020]  It's it's a recipe of how to draw a scene and you feed that to the gpu and then the gpu will just tear through
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:16.340]  It and and produce the output. Um
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:19.380]  and the interesting thing is that
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:23.220]  stuff like opengl was targeted at
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:26.180]  rendering 3d scenes
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.580]  It's you know gl is graphics language. It's the open graphics language, um
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.900]  direct x 3d similarly all about that, um
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.420]  Metal
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:44.420]  Is about leveraging the capabilities of this off-board super parallel
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:48.420]  Compute device
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:53.460]  It happens that it's really good at rendering pixels and transforming 3d stuff
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.460]  but
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:02.100]  The math required to do 3d and to to shade the pixels and to make everything look pretty
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:06.500]  Is also the math that can be applied in any number of different ways
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:09.140]  It may not be graphics related at all
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.420]  It may not be graphics related. So open so metal
[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.460]  uh
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:19.620]  Does what opengl does and it also does what opencl does
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:24.180]  Um, like our friend chris lisio does a lot of stuff in opencl with with capo
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:30.100]  I know gus miller with acorn does a lot of stuff in on the mac with the
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:32.900]  with opencl, um
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.620]  metal presents the device as
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:44.900]  A massively parallel independent compute device it gets down to the fact that ultimately you could describe
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:52.180]  You could describe computers in general as machines that do math really fast and in in recent years
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:59.940]  It's the gpu's not the cpu's that have gotten faster and faster and faster at that and that there's I actually
[01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:02.740]  so so the cpu's are good at um
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.100]  I guess the
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:10.420]  They're better at switching on conditions
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:15.880]  Like if you've done this then that if this then like they have a lower latency
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:20.340]  The gpu's are like the most data you can throw at them
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:27.380]  And just have them crunch on it in the same way without changing any of the logic, uh, the faster they go
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:30.660]  um and optimizing for the two
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.740]  Is is different not not in terms of the programmer but in terms of the
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:41.380]  The the cpu needs to be responsive and will latency the gpu
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:48.420]  Uh needs to basically I mean you give it play the stake and it's it's done in like two seconds
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.580]  And it's not I made the mistake last week with shiller about
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:55.540]  Emphasizing gaming and it's great for games, but it's definitely not and one of the mistake one of the reasons
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:59.300]  I made the mistake is I hadn't seen the state of the union yet and then the state of the union
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:04.420]  I thought this was great. I thought they were a it was good two good demos, but I thought it was really cool to see adobe
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:10.500]  On stage, you know, they had a guy from adobe on stage, right? They showed this crazy complicated
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:13.620]  Illustrator
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:16.500]  document where you could zoom in live whereas
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:20.980]  Prior to and this is a version that's not shipping yet because it's based on metal. It's on the mac
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:27.940]  And you could zoom into this crazy detail and with metal they could do it in real time and instead of typing a new number
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:33.380]  In the zoom box and then waiting a second for it to re-render at that resolution. You just zoom in on the fly
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:39.460]  And and then they showed video effects and after effects that previously rendered like, you know, a really slow frame rate now
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:45.460]  They're rendering in real time. It's it's a you know, all sorts of things already rendered in real time and after effects
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:51.460]  But this was a totally plausible demo of something somebody might be doing that's gone from you know
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:57.540]  You kind of get like a preview to now it goes in real time. So it's a big win for graphics professionals, too
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  I totally
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:05.700]  Um, and so there was a time there where adobe was, you know flash
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:07.540]  not great
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.340]  uh
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:14.500]  But adobe has been a long time friend of apples going back to like the first laser printer the laser writer. Uh
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:22.020]  And you know, I mean, oh, yeah ken what's his name the watch guy? Oh, I know what you mean ken
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:28.180]  And forget his name I know you can forget his name
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:29.620]  Can't forget his name. Yeah
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:34.900]  I'm, not sure if that's how you pronounce it in the original irish. But yeah, um
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:40.420]  He wrote a piece being like yeah flashes forever whenever he came back, uh
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:46.340]  Adobe and apple have had a very very tight relationship for a long time
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:52.740]  And say what you will about adobe from I don't know what like 98 to
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:59.940]  Are you thinking of ken fairy kind of thing? No, ken fair is awesome some other guy some other ken. Yeah, he was on equity
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.900]  He did eight nine. I don't even want to talk. He's utterly okay
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.660]  Um
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:11.860]  But yeah apple and adobe have had a lot
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:18.420]  long relationship and i'm so happy to see them back on stage because they should be they should be hanging out like the
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:20.420]  The
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.540]  There's problems with adobe stuff but the notion that
[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.180]  I like that. They're the the the creativity and apple that they told. Yeah
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:33.140]  I like that the relationship between adobe and apple is on the upswing
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:37.140]  Like I feel like it bottomed out and instead of continuing to deteriorate
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:43.060]  It's obviously on the upswing and it's cool that they're working with adobe well in advance, you know, certainly well
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:47.460]  You know clearly if they've got the demos already working adobe didn't have to wait until
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:49.220]  um
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.420]  wwdc to find out about metal and it even ties in with my carbon 64 joke last week because
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:52:02.660]  Whatever year that was 2006 2007 when the bottom dropped out on carbon 64 where the year before
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:06.180]  Carbon was going to 64 bits and then the next year it was like guess what?
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.940]  No, uh, I know for a fact that adobe found out about it when it was
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:17.480]  When it was announced at wwdc, which is really probably the the nadir the bottoming out of the adobe apple relationship
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.460]  Well thoughts on flash might have been
[01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:28.820]  I but I think feel like that was that that was a that's a specific team at adobe whereas the carbon 64 thing I think
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.140]  Hit closer to
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:36.500]  To home, but maybe that's just my bias towards being you know, being a longtime fan of their creative tools
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.500]  Creative tools
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:42.420]  Yeah, right, but neither of them neither of them helped
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:47.620]  All right. Let me take one last break here and thank our do our last sponsor read
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:49.780]  and
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.720]  Shockingly surprisingly. It's uh our good friends at squarespace
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:00.260]  longtime supporters of podcasts in general, but certainly a longtime supporter of this show, uh, you guys know
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:05.620]  Squarespace simple powerful beautiful websites. It's a way to build your own website
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:12.660]  And instead of rolling it all from the ground up and getting a web hosting account and writing code and figuring out and installing
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:13.700]  Software and stuff like that
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:20.180]  It's a platform where you start with a website that works and you have templates to choose from and you can
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:25.540]  Customize these things through drag and drop right in your browser what you see really is what you get
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.780]  You don't have to go into a special editing mode
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:32.180]  You're just logged in and you want to add something to the sidebar. You just add it to the sidebar
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:36.660]  You can see what it looks like if you don't like it. You can move it to a different column or something like that
[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:43.300]  All of these templates they're all responsive so you don't have to do anything right out of the box your website already looks great
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:45.300]  on iPhones and other smartphones
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:50.660]  Right out of the box. You've got commerce. So if you want to set up a store, you don't have to install anything
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.700]  You don't have to upgrade your plan. That's just something that you get right there. So you want to set up a store?
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:54:00.180]  You want to do something like that right there in Squarespace. You want to set up a podcast?
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:04.740]  They've already got tools for that where you just upload you, you know, they've got an audio player
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:09.140]  It rolls out your feed so that your podcast already has a feed everything like that
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:16.180]  All built in right from the start you can get a trial with no credit card required
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:22.900]  You just go there sign up start using it you get 30 days and you don't pay until your trial is up
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:24.900]  Until your trial is up
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:29.780]  And here's a new thing they have right now. I know you guys have heard me talk about Squarespace before this is brand new

[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:17.220]  All right, we got to cut through the rest of this real quick. There's a you can see why Apple's Keynote went long
[01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:23.940]  Yeah a little bit you know what I I thought it was like, yeah, nothing major happened. So, all right
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:26.740]  What do we know because what do we know about the low power mode?
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:29.700]  Oh
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:34.740]  This is for iPhone. Okay. So here's the thing. Uh, I believe when you get to
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:39.300]  20% they prompt you and so do you want to enter low power mode?
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:47.860]  Do you want to enter low power mode? Uh, I if I'm not mistaken Android phones do this already?
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:56.980]  I don't know. Uh, what I was curious about was why does the and this is kind of weird but
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:00.740]  I would
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.300]  Be curious to know how a phone felt if it just slowly got
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.740]  Uh less responsive as the power went down
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:16.980]  Here's what I know about low power so far. I know that it it turns off like the highest energy, uh highest performance
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:23.220]  Parts of the CPU so like an app that might be able to kick the the CPU into a higher gear
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:26.260]  It no longer does that so it'll slow some things down like that
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:30.100]  Uh, it turns off background downloads for some apps
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:34.740]  Uh, so it won't unnecessarily do things on hit the network in the background until you need it
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:39.700]  Like it might switch your email from push to pull. So it'll only check email when you go there
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:44.980]  And it turns out this is one of the things when he said like when when Craig Federighi said
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:48.180]  That it pulls some levers and gears that you didn't even think were there
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:52.740]  And one of those is that it turns off some of the animations in the UI
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:59.380]  So that things are just does less and it looks less cool little cool things get turned off
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:03.940]  But that they can really stretch out the amount of time you get on that last 20% of the battery
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:08.420]  So here's I think it's good. I think that's a good feature. Uh
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:19.060]  I'm just curious about like, uh, how about when it gets below 33% you just start throttling all of this back automatically
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.860]  In the if you don't have a lot of power
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:29.460]  Your device is tired. It's not going to be animating all the time or it's not going to be downloading that much and
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.100]  I think that's understandable to a user
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:40.020]  Is that crazy to think of yeah, like you were I see from your notes that you're calling it anthropomorphic
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:45.300]  But yeah, like your iPhone's tired and so it's slowed down, you know, like when you run out of energy that seems natural to me
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:50.020]  Yeah, like as we run out of energy on this show we start making less and less sense
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:52.420]  People who are listening totally understand
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:56.900]  Right, so i'm curious. I mean, I don't even know if that was
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:01.940]  Yeah, I don't know really it's just a funny thing. It's sort of like we were saying about um,
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.300]  the the ios turning the
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:08.100]  unix model of app
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:14.100]  Lifespan on its head where unix keeps processes alive until the process decides it wants to be dead
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:20.500]  Or it wants to exit. Uh, it is sort of similar to that where it's like the way computers have always worked is to always
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:24.100]  Run as fast as you can at all times and then all of a sudden you're out of energy
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.100]  You know if you're running on a battery, well, that's it
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:32.900]  We have to go whereas it's kind of interesting to think of of a of a machine that gets tired
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:38.020]  And does less so that it can stay awake to some, you know be useful in some way longer
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:43.380]  I think so, but on the other hand, I mean
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:48.500]  I mean if jonas is playing a game don't you want like
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:53.300]  Wouldn't he be pissed I guess I don't know if all of a sudden he's dropping frame rates this kid
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.980]  I'll tell you what. There's one way to get this kid fired up. It's to drop below 60
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:02.740]  Well, you're definitely the daddy so you could work on that
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.860]  Oh, man, we're never going to cover all this stuff. What about the uh, I got a dog
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:13.860]  What do you call when joanna stern was on we had a dog pooping so oh I love that
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:20.420]  She's never gonna more for her. You're never gonna be she tracks me up like crazy having a dog poop mid-show is
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:25.860]  I would say the two two high it's hard to two highlights of the year so far number two
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:28.580]  having fun
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:34.660]  It's hard to two highlights of the year so far number two, uh having phil schiller as a guest and then number one
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:40.100]  Was having joanna stern's dog poop mid-show and even phil schiller can't beat that
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:46.660]  Yeah, uh, don't make me top that because yeah, we don't we don't you you still want to know where that's gonna go
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:53.140]  What about the uh deep linking into apps? There's this cool thing and i've got ios 9
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:59.940]  Running on my old 5s and i'm just starting to notice it but like and part of it like one example is like that
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:03.460]  Safari is now available as a view controller within your app
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:08.260]  So like and the example that already works is if you click a link in mail
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:16.020]  Instead of switching to safari you get a slide over panel that is safari and so your bookmarks are there
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:21.300]  It's it's not just a web view. It's safari. It's a safari view, but then you get this new
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:24.980]  Like back button up in the menu or not the menu bar the saddest bar
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:28.900]  And then when you're done you just tap that and you're right back to where you were
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:36.900]  Uh, I think that's and it's and it's a safari view controller is brilliant
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:46.580]  Uh, you know, it's not technically that far off from what we saw with extensions and presenting applications within other contexts
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:48.820]  but
[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:52.740]  But man, does that ever resolve a lot of problems?
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:56.980]  Like I mean what
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:02.980]  I can't even you know what I don't remember what happens in vespa if you clip it, uh, we have our own built-in web view
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.220]  That yeah, you know what love to get rid of frankly, right?
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:10.020]  Right. I would love to get rid. Why would you want to write that?
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:15.220]  Well, because it was better than switching it to safari every time if you just wanted to type the link and then not
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:20.020]  I not totally and you know, I don't want to speak for brent, but uh
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:28.100]  Pretty sure he did not. No, he definitely didn't right yet. Another web view. Yeah. No, nobody does really so I think that that's
[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:32.900]  One of the things that fallouts in this is we're going to see a lot of apps this year switch from their built-in web
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:37.140]  Views to just relying on this once they can or or you know
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:41.140]  They'll keep it around but only for the people who haven't upgraded to ios 9 yet
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:46.180]  Right, but you know down the road they can just get rid of it and thank god it should because
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.820]  And I like the solution so far
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:56.100]  Of having that back button up in the status menu which solves the problem that the the hardware back button on android
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:02:00.100]  Tries to solve but which I always find just confuses the hell out of me
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:08.180]  Yeah, because the big difference is that with this ios one it tells you exactly where you're going back to it says back to mail
[02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:14.980]  Right, and it'll say that for any app that invokes that yeah and it's open like there's just and their example is obviously that
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:20.040]  You know twitter got invited to early access to this and so that you can have a twitter.com
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:21.860]  Slash
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:24.180]  You know gte slash tweet id
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:30.660]  Url and instead of opening it as a web view twitter can claim that domain and then open it right in the twitter app
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.620]  And it's again, it's like a view controller
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:38.820]  So it's not switching you to the app. It's just showing you a twitter view temporarily and then you can hit back
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:40.820]  And you're right back to reading your email
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:46.500]  So one big change is that uh, they are not
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:52.100]  Happy with http and they want to move over to http for everything
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:57.060]  For everything, uh, in fact if you use their higher level
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:03:00.100]  Apis, they're not going to be able to do that
[02:03:00.100 --> 02:03:03.940]  In fact, if you use their higher level apis, uh
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.600]  Http connections will basically be rejected
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:12.980]  um, so we had to you know, we got a cert and
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:18.900]  for h and distilled, uh, and we were doing just benign stuff like asking for
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.820]  Like a list of tutorial text, you know, like nothing bad
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.580]  um
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:26.420]  But whatever
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:32.180]  They're not wrong. So we moved over to http. Um, you can have exceptions
[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:36.740]  like if you're reading like, you know, like you said before like a twitter client or uh,
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:42.740]  Marcos overcast or like another podcasting app you're going to need to connect to domains that
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:44.660]  uh
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:49.060]  Are not under your control and you cannot assume that they have um,
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:52.180]  a security certificate
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:54.180]  So
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:57.780]  That said, uh, that's a bit of a weird
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:00.020]  kind of change
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:02.020]  Because things just keep
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:08.260]  Breaking in weird places, but I do think it's a skate to where the puck is going to be type of change like it
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:12.260]  Yeah, I totally it's you can smell it coming that pretty soon
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:18.340]  Just playing http is going to be considered gross like the way ftp is compared to sftp or something like that
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:23.300]  Even though it's not as personal, you know, and i've got during fireball set up now to do http
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.700]  s for I think I think everything works, but um
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:33.220]  But I still don't link to that by default and I think I probably should and I think it's like the old time
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:38.340]  90s web developer in me who thinks well that's slow and if it isn't actually asking for
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:43.220]  Personal information of any sort you shouldn't you know, there's no reason to do that
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:49.800]  Whereas I think in the modern day, I think any modern web server can serve htps like that's the least of your problems performance-wise
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:56.180]  Yeah, I mean even for static content like we I mean these days we do full disk
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.180]  encryption
[02:04:58.180 --> 02:05:02.820]  Like every block you read and write is getting encrypted on the way in and out and it's effectively free
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:04.980]  uh
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:06.340]  I wouldn't worry about
[02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:13.140]  Https i'm going to start doing that because you know what I want to get your bullshit not somebody's some third parties bullshit
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:18.020]  uh, another thing just small little thing, but one thing I noticed was that
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:23.080]  The way that all the groundwork apple has laid for accessibility
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:30.020]  And and and the primary reason for that is to help people who need it people with low vision
[02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.220]  accessibility features for that, uh, you know
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:37.620]  Uh, whatever whatever the the the problems you might have that you need accessibility
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:43.460]  That's the primary reason to do it, but all sorts of good things are falling out with that. So like xcode has a new
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:45.620]  UI
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:49.220]  Debugging features where you can debug the user interface of your app
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:54.500]  Not just the logic of the app and it's all built on top of the accessibility features
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:06:01.860]  So it's two good things that come out of the same thing you make your act accessible and then xcode can debug the user interface
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:03.860]  The user interface
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.900]  So i'm so glad you brought this up because uh
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:13.540]  Whatever we skipped over like in the in the order of the notes that we've got we we skipped over it, uh
[02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:19.300]  Accessibility is almost a misnomer. Um
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:24.280]  The way that you set up accessibility is basically to present your application
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:27.540]  um
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:31.620]  In such a way that is open to alternative interfaces, uh
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:37.220]  The primary interface is obviously uikit or appkit on the mac. Um
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:43.400]  But accessibility presents your interface in a way that it can be understood
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:48.020]  By people who are uh have
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:54.420]  Site impediments or uh, no other um
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.280]  Um
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.200]  disabilities people with like
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:02.360]  Motor disabilities challenges or yeah, they you write motors disabilities
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:07.000]  Like there's a lot of that too. It exposes what the the application's intent
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:10.280]  rather than the visual interface which
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:17.400]  You know, we all pay a lot of attention to mostly because uh, I believe like the the majority of us are
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:22.840]  Uh have some like a fair degree of visual acumen
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.360]  um
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:28.680]  But apple's really gone another way on this and you know what they don't make money on this
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:30.920]  There's no way
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:35.240]  No, and and you know, it's one of those things that tim cook has said they don't do it for the roi
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.680]  But good things come out of it though, right like this
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.400]  I totally agree. Yeah, I am like
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.680]  I
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.680]  You know, uh, you know our friend
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.320]  Doug russell is a huge proponent of this kind of stuff. Uh,
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:56.760]  I love it. First of all, the accessibility api it makes you consider
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.840]  What your application is about more than
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:08.120]  Laying out buttons or laying out, you know sliders and table views and all that accessibility makes you reason about
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.760]  How you're exposing your data model
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.160]  And I think for that reason alone. It's it's worth considering
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:18.200]  um, the other thing that I really and
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  And
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:27.240]  Just as an aside, uh, apparently the the heller keller helen keller achievement award was
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.760]  Uh awarded to voice over this year
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:36.520]  I didn't see that but I i'm way too good. Yeah, it's on loop inside. It's like yeah
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:41.560]  uh, but the other thing that I that I found fascinating was um
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:48.200]  Ios has gone hard on adapting, uh, right to left. Yeah, that's the other big thing. I noticed and I'd noted
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:50.200]  It's like if you set up
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.880]  your
[02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.600]  If you do this if you set up your layouts the way apple wants you to for like
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:08:59.880]  Your view controllers and for going into your hierarchy
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:01.720]  it it
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:08.680]  It sounds unbelievable to me, but it's like it it just works and so like for people using right to left languages
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.160]  Like hebrew hebrew and arabic are obviously the the two big ones that at least I know of
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:17.960]  Your whole app can go right to left
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.960]  Right and and right which is great and I don't even know what proportion of the world
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:29.560]  I mean, so it's arabic and he the the big ones to them aware of yeah that same here
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:35.400]  But it's like it's mind-blowing to me and and and uh, I for I forget how you pronounce her last name
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:42.200]  But it was sarah radhi radhi radhi radhi. Yeah, who did the demo and it was like mind-blowing because it's like here's an app
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:49.800]  where it starts on the right and the back button is top right and you go further into the hierarchy by going to the left and
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:51.000]  It all
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.200]  You know, I hate you know, sounds too good to be true, but all just works
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:57.720]  but yeah, they did not fund that in like the uh,
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:00.600]  the pagination view where
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.840]  I guess the best example is the home screen the one that she used right is like
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.880]  Rather than going left to right to advance through pages you go right to left
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:18.120]  That's brilliant and that's a little like a lot of work and um
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:20.920]  I'm not
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:22.920]  I don't know. I haven't timed it out, but
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:30.040]  Her time on stage at the state of the union was certainly comparable to uh, josh and eliza's. Yeah
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:39.400]  And this was for something like eliza and josh did watch kit which everybody is like rabid for her and
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:43.720]  Savarati did
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:49.160]  Accessibility and user well, so she didn't do accessibility user interface layer from right to left
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.800]  And they made they they really hammered it home and I
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:58.200]  It's one of the remarkable remarkable things about apple is that they
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:07.320]  I I really think it's these kind of things that make me believe that they
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:12.200]  Um are being honest when they say that they
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:15.320]  Hold these things dear to them. Yeah
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:19.640]  Is that the amount of minutes that they gave this talk?
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.920]  The the fact that they even bothered developing it
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:25.320]  Why would you?
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:27.640]  There's no reason i'm sure that there's enough
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.000]  Bullshit phones out there or bullshit devices that don't bother to do the right to left thing
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.760]  But it's better and so yeah, it's funny because you don't I I don't think of it
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.880]  As in somebody who literally owns a phone
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:47.000]  I don't think of it as a somebody who literally only speaks one language english
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:50.920]  But I don't think about the fact I like if I think about it
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:53.000]  I realize it makes sense, but on a day-to-day basis
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.800]  I don't think about the fact that the way that the hierarchies work like just column view in the finder
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:02.920]  Or you know, which which is an old nextism that goes back to the 80s this sort of column view
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:09.880]  Which really really set the stage for the brilliant. It's the ipod. That's the future. I mean, it's it the iphone
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:14.680]  At the but that column, but the reason we go left to right with that is because our language is left to right
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.720]  And that's how we go our eyes go left to right and that for right to left
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:22.360]  Languages it would make more sense for
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:26.120]  The the hierarchy of the interface to go right to left as well
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.080]  And yeah and programmatically
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.960]  It's honestly not that
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.280]  Difficult. I mean the other thing that they've you got to bend your mind a little bit, but
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:39.800]  It's just yeah, the other thing I got out of that it part of it
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.720]  Is that it's the right thing to do and like you said they didn't have to because i'm sure that people
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:51.160]  Who who run their iphones in arabic are used to the fact that they're reading the words right to left
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.960]  But they're navigating the interface left to right that they're just used to that like yeah, i'm left-handed
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.560]  I've adapted to it to to a world that is right-handed
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:05.560]  And i'm sure that people that read right to left naturally just like well screw it
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.280]  Well screw it my phone works this way and that's fine
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:13.880]  But there's another there's another aspect of this that does have a practical upside for apple and that's the fact that they're making it
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.280]  They keep adding features to add
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:19.640]  Translations to your app in other languages, right?
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:24.840]  uh as as easy as possible and as powerful as possible and they even emphasize now that only
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.000]  I might get the number wrong, but somewhere around 30 of app downloads are in the united states right now
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:33.080]  And i'm not quite sure they didn't do it by language
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:40.840]  But if it only 30 of app downloads are in the united states and a huge portion of them just just two countries alone china and japan
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:45.960]  together account for over 50 of app downloads, so
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.320]  If you want to you're you're leaving off a majority of the ios
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:56.120]  User base if you don't have chinese and japanese translations of your app
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.440]  And obviously like you and I we you know, I can't translate
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:04.520]  Vesper into chinese and you can't just translate napkin into japanese
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:10.360]  But there are services that we can commission to do these translations for us. Here's a list of english strings
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:13.000]  Please give us you know, the japanese and chinese equivalents
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:18.920]  Um apple is bending over backwards, I think to make that possible and that's so that you don't have you know
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:25.240]  Chinese users don't have to only use apps written by chinese developers that they can get apps that are written, you know
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:30.360]  From anybody anywhere in the world that just takes the step of getting a translator to translate the ui
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:38.680]  Yeah, I totally agree. Um, I didn't I didn't count them before the show because I wasn't sure if we'd need it but uh,
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  i'm gonna guess it was
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:45.720]  Minimum two at least three or four sessions that addressed. Uh,
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Internationalization
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:51.800]  Like they they're not kidding about this
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:57.480]  Like they they're not kidding about this. I I I don't think we're done hearing about I think that's I think that's going to be
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:00.300]  like a constant theme henceforth in wwdc
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.480]  And it should be because you know
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:10.600]  The world is a big place and pretending that the the us is the only place that matters is
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  It's the only place that matters the most though
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:20.680]  Well, it's the only place that matters historically and that you can work out deals no seriously, um, you know
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.320]  I'm canadian. I I we're not going to get news
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  we didn't even get to that but
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:32.440]  Well, because you know, I mean there's a lot of uh, we have some restrictions on canadian content and
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.400]  Quebec is predominantly francophone. So there's that hurdle
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:44.040]  Um, we know people who've worked in the iBooks side of things that have had difficulty
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.400]  Landing deals with canada just because of that kind of thing. So I understand it. Um,
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.760]  Just to bring it back to making fun of you
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.560]  How funny was it when they ran daring fireball on the news thing
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.640]  I it was very funny and I was writing a new book
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:08.520]  I it was very funny and I was writing a note at the time. So what happened was whenever
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.680]  We said susan prescott was unveiling news and she was saying, you know
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.040]  In addition to like the new york times and wired magazine and all these big brands
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:21.880]  She was like you could also read your favorite blogs like daring fireball and I was like heads down writing notes in my notebook
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:23.880]  and I was like wait, I
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:28.360]  And I look up the only thing and I had no idea the thing that made me mad about it
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.640]  My first thought was wow, that's incredible. I cannot believe that just happened
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:36.120]  And my second thought is I wish that they had told me in advance because I would have I would have given them a much
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:41.000]  Better graphic for the logo like they made my logo. They also opted you in with
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:46.040]  Like don't worry he'll be in he'll be yeah, and I was like, I guess i'm signing up
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.840]  Uh, we don't have time to talk about this apparently they had to change it because your grade looks shitty
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:57.320]  Yeah, the color. I didn't mind that they changed the color because it doesn't look good projected what I don't like
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:02.520]  What I don't like it's like what I didn't like is that they made this circle with the star in it as big as could
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:07.480]  Possibly fit in the space. Whereas it should have been small and my example all week long as i've been
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:13.880]  Complaining about this incredibly great publicity that they give me is that if you look at the back of your iphone
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:16.520]  How big is the apple on the back of the iphone? It's small
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.960]  Well, that's how small the daring fireball logo should have been in the overall rectangle that they give you
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:25.720]  On the news site, whereas they made it like as big as it could possibly be to fit
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:31.880]  It but that's a small you know what i've gone this entire show thing saying like nice things about you
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:39.320]  You know what when they show my logo in a they could make it whatever fucking size in the keynote, okay
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.120]  Yeah
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.080]  All right, fair enough. All right, I gotta go. This has been a great time. I'm done with it
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:50.200]  Anyway, really appreciate let me thank our sponsors, uh harry's
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:51.640]  uh

[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:08.520]  Uh, and you know, you're okay on twitter and uh your uh app napkin is at uh,
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.680]  You could just google it eight, but it's at uh age. How do you spell the domain name?
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:19.320]  h dash and dash distill.com or napkn dot
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:25.560]  And uh, whatever just type it in just type type it in your favorite search engine just type
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:31.560]  Napkin and you'll find it a great great app for the mac that I use all the time. So, uh, check it out
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.120]  Uh, and i'll talk to you soon
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:40.440]  Nap. Can that's it? Wait, is it really easy to remember easy to remember anyway, wait, wait
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.800]  I should nap
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:51.800]  N-a-p dot k-n-a-p dot k-n. Well, this is that's super exciting. That's a great. Uh, that's a great domain name
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:19:13.800]  You know what Schiller did not have to put up with it a little bit
