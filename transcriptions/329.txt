[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  David, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:01.680 --> 00:03.520]  Happy Thanksgiving to you.
[00:03.520 --> 00:06.480]  So you are currently in the UK.
[00:06.480 --> 00:09.400]  What is it like as an American
[00:09.400 --> 00:12.420]  living in the UK for Thanksgiving?
[00:13.960 --> 00:17.600]  It is quiet, I think is probably the best word for it.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.200]  It's a weird week where I'm just like
[00:20.200 --> 00:22.040]  normally doing work stuff, everything's great.
[00:22.040 --> 00:25.000]  And then everything's gotten quiet, there's no news.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.200]  Everyone's like quiet on social media.
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.100]  Everything seems to sort of be shutting down,
[00:29.100 --> 00:30.840]  but everything's like totally normal life here.
[00:30.840 --> 00:34.000]  And here it's a funny thing too
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.960]  where I go to the grocery store
[00:35.960 --> 00:39.720]  and they're like, turkeys are coming December 17th.
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.400]  It's like, what?
[00:41.400 --> 00:43.700]  It's like, because turkey's the big Christmas thing here
[00:43.700 --> 00:45.320]  rather than the Thanksgiving thing.
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.720]  And so it's just, it's been a bit of an adjustment
[00:47.720 --> 00:49.740]  and we'll still have some Thanksgiving here.
[00:49.740 --> 00:52.080]  You know, I'm having a, but it's a different event
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.480]  where we're having Thanksgiving on Saturday
[00:54.480 --> 00:57.560]  because that's convenient because no one has time off work.
[00:57.560 --> 01:00.080]  And so it's like, we're doing a little
[01:00.080 --> 01:02.000]  Thanksgiving gathering on Saturday instead.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.600]  But yeah, it's different, but still nice.
[01:08.120 --> 01:11.360]  It's funny because, you know, Christmas is Christmas
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.920]  and I know it's a religious holiday technically,
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.800]  but it's sort of evolved into a sort of secular Santa Claus
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.380]  as well and it's the same, right?
[01:20.380 --> 01:23.620]  Like everybody, even Canada, even the weirdos in Canada
[01:23.620 --> 01:26.620]  celebrate Christmas on Christmas.
[01:26.620 --> 01:29.800]  But Thanksgiving is such a uniquely US holiday.
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.240]  It's always a bit strange thinking about
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.580]  what it's like to be outside the US.
[01:34.580 --> 01:35.800]  And it's such a big deal.
[01:35.800 --> 01:39.200]  It's like number one travel, holiday in the US,
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.960]  et cetera, et cetera.
[01:40.960 --> 01:42.280]  Anyway, glad to hear it.
[01:42.280 --> 01:44.280]  So you were able to obtain a turkey
[01:44.280 --> 01:46.920]  even though the turkeys are all slated for Christmas?
[01:46.920 --> 01:49.180]  Yes, there's only one store we found
[01:49.180 --> 01:50.600]  that had turkeys this early.
[01:50.600 --> 01:53.400]  But we were able to find one, we were able to acquire one.
[01:53.400 --> 01:56.960]  And so we will be able to have a turkey for Thanksgiving.
[01:56.960 --> 01:58.500]  Well, that is good to hear.
[01:58.500 --> 01:59.340]  There's a lot going on.
[01:59.340 --> 02:00.480]  You know, breaking news,
[02:00.480 --> 02:02.600]  literally right before we started recording,
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.040]  did you see this, that Apple is suing NSO Group,
[02:06.040 --> 02:08.000]  the Israeli spyware firm.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.160]  We don't have a lot of details,
[02:09.160 --> 02:11.240]  but the thing that struck me,
[02:11.240 --> 02:12.840]  and I stole it from my friend Nat
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.560]  who emailed me about it or texted me about it,
[02:15.560 --> 02:18.040]  but the grounds for the lawsuit is
[02:18.040 --> 02:20.040]  some organization did an investigation
[02:20.040 --> 02:22.640]  into NSO Group's Pegasus spyware.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.900]  And then in their investigation,
[02:24.900 --> 02:28.680]  revealed apparently heretofore unknown to Apple,
[02:28.680 --> 02:31.560]  proof of how, or examples of how Pegasus worked.
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.560]  And I guess they got to examine a phone
[02:33.560 --> 02:35.140]  that was infected or something like that,
[02:35.140 --> 02:36.200]  and Apple got to study it.
[02:36.200 --> 02:38.680]  And one of the things that Apple figured out
[02:38.680 --> 02:42.100]  was that NSO Group, in the course of making the software,
[02:42.100 --> 02:47.100]  had created a hundred or hundreds of fake Apple IDs
[02:47.820 --> 02:49.480]  to make this work.
[02:49.480 --> 02:51.960]  And that's against the terms of service
[02:51.960 --> 02:53.720]  of the developer agreement.
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.460]  And it says in the developer agreement
[02:58.460 --> 03:00.100]  that if you break these rules,
[03:00.100 --> 03:02.480]  it'll be governed by the laws of Northern California
[03:02.480 --> 03:04.440]  or California, and that's how they're able
[03:04.440 --> 03:06.880]  to bring this federal suit against them.
[03:06.880 --> 03:10.640]  And my quip was that it's like shades
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.000]  of nailing Al Capone for tax evasion,
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.160]  creating fake Apple IDs.
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.760]  That's the thing that got them.
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.080]  But go Apple, go, I say.
[03:21.080 --> 03:24.940]  I'm not a fan of the NSO Group and their business model.
[03:24.940 --> 03:27.240]  I mean, the thing that strikes me about this article,
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.440]  just reading it quickly though,
[03:28.440 --> 03:31.240]  is the sense of you so often in public,
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.860]  Apple executives are very buttoned down,
[03:33.860 --> 03:36.080]  straightforward, very professional.
[03:36.080 --> 03:38.800]  And like the quote the New York Times has
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.800]  from, it's Ivan Krstic.
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.040]  It's like, this is Apple saying,
[03:44.040 --> 03:45.960]  if you do this, if you weaponize our software
[03:45.960 --> 03:48.240]  against innocent users, researchers, dissidents,
[03:48.240 --> 03:51.920]  activists, and journalists, Apple will give you no quarter.
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.560]  Like they're not messing around.
[03:53.560 --> 03:56.520]  Like that is, like in a public, you know,
[03:56.520 --> 03:59.360]  on the record to the New York Times statement,
[03:59.360 --> 04:00.920]  if they're making that, you know,
[04:00.920 --> 04:04.480]  sort of speaking that strongly,
[04:04.480 --> 04:06.800]  clearly this is, you know, they mean business.
[04:06.800 --> 04:08.120]  They're going to do whatever they can
[04:08.120 --> 04:10.600]  to shut things like this down.
[04:10.600 --> 04:12.360]  Tell us what you really think, Ivan.
[04:12.360 --> 04:14.760]  Yeah, it's like, give you no quarter.
[04:14.760 --> 04:17.520]  It's like, that's some strong words.
[04:17.520 --> 04:19.720]  You know, it reminds me of the one time
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.600]  I was doing my live show and I believe it came up,
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.280]  I think it was when Phil Schiller was the guest or a guest.
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.200]  And I asked about what they thought about leaks
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.280]  and man, did it get serious quick.
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.080]  Like they really, really hate leaks.
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.400]  And it was a good moment in the show.
[04:41.400 --> 04:43.800]  I'm glad I was like, man, I'm glad I asked, that was great.
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.080]  But it was also sort of like, oh, this isn't funny anymore.
[04:47.080 --> 04:49.640]  Yeah, I was going to say, and I think it speaks to,
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.320]  there are things that Apple can be flexible on
[04:51.320 --> 04:52.960]  and there are things that I think that internally
[04:52.960 --> 04:54.240]  that they're not flexible.
[04:54.240 --> 04:55.920]  And it's like, and the reason I think,
[04:55.920 --> 04:58.040]  if I remember that talk show episode correctly,
[04:58.040 --> 05:00.840]  it's like the thing that I think where it struck a chord
[05:00.840 --> 05:03.680]  is that it isn't that leaks hurt Apple
[05:03.680 --> 05:04.760]  from a business perspective.
[05:04.760 --> 05:06.320]  I don't think that was the impression I got,
[05:06.320 --> 05:08.640]  is that they get really frustrated
[05:08.640 --> 05:11.640]  because leaks hurt the efforts of the people
[05:11.640 --> 05:14.520]  working inside of Apple to make something
[05:14.520 --> 05:17.440]  that can have a special moment in the sun.
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.440]  When it's, if it appears out, it's surprised,
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.480]  they can tell the story of that feature
[05:23.480 --> 05:26.880]  in a way that does its due.
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.440]  That it isn't, that people have expected this to happen
[05:29.440 --> 05:33.440]  or they got a sort of a leak that only has half the story.
[05:33.440 --> 05:35.240]  And so people have built up in their mind,
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.320]  like with the Apple Watch and people wanted a different,
[05:38.320 --> 05:41.100]  you know, a different case shape and that didn't happen.
[05:41.100 --> 05:42.600]  And then it's a disappointment.
[05:42.600 --> 05:45.360]  And the fact that that like is hurtful to the people
[05:45.360 --> 05:49.740]  who have been working on this for years at a time,
[05:49.740 --> 05:51.760]  and then it's kind of, it's robbing them
[05:51.760 --> 05:53.880]  of that sense of accomplishment.
[05:53.880 --> 05:55.680]  And it's like, this feels very much, it's,
[05:55.680 --> 05:57.720]  it isn't necessarily, I mean, I'm sure Apple doesn't like
[05:57.720 --> 05:59.960]  that people are hacking into this,
[05:59.960 --> 06:03.160]  but Apple doesn't like the impact this is having
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.080]  on users, researchers, dissidents, activists,
[06:06.080 --> 06:09.240]  and journalists, but that is at a personal level,
[06:09.240 --> 06:12.300]  rather than just like a business, dollars and cents,
[06:12.300 --> 06:14.640]  how this shows up on their profit and loss.
[06:14.640 --> 06:18.600]  Like they don't want their software to be used
[06:18.600 --> 06:21.280]  in a way that has this harm in the world.
[06:21.280 --> 06:23.720]  Clearly it struck a nerve in a way that is different
[06:23.720 --> 06:25.720]  than even you think about Apple's,
[06:25.720 --> 06:27.280]  the way they talk about the Epic suit,
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.600]  or they talk about, you know, where it's like,
[06:28.600 --> 06:30.160]  someone sued them and took them to court
[06:30.160 --> 06:31.400]  and did a whole big thing.
[06:31.400 --> 06:33.400]  And it's like, but it's still, it's like,
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.560]  that's a business transaction.
[06:34.560 --> 06:36.760]  That is something that they can, it's not personal.
[06:36.760 --> 06:37.760]  That's just business.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.820]  Whereas this feels much more personal.
[06:39.820 --> 06:42.220]  Yeah, I don't think they have warm feelings towards
[06:42.220 --> 06:45.920]  Tim Sweeney or Epic, but I also don't think
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.840]  that they're like furiously angry
[06:47.840 --> 06:50.920]  and they're not going to tell Epic that we're,
[06:50.920 --> 06:55.920]  if you try to screw with our in-app purchases,
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.560]  we will give you no quarter.
[06:57.560 --> 06:58.400]  No.
[06:58.400 --> 06:59.560]  It's not going that way.
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.360]  Another recent news story from last week.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.200]  Did you see this?
[07:05.200 --> 07:07.240]  This was a story by,
[07:07.240 --> 07:08.840]  I hope I'm pronouncing his surname correctly,
[07:08.840 --> 07:13.400]  John Coatsire at Forbes with the headline,
[07:13.400 --> 07:16.560]  Apple quietly buying ads via Google
[07:16.560 --> 07:18.440]  for high value subscription apps
[07:18.440 --> 07:21.020]  to capture app publisher revenue.
[07:21.020 --> 07:23.700]  This came out either a week ago today
[07:23.700 --> 07:25.400]  or a week ago yesterday.
[07:25.400 --> 07:29.000]  And it was the kerfuffle of the day.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.360]  The general consensus seemed to be that,
[07:31.360 --> 07:34.200]  that this was outrageous and scandalous
[07:34.200 --> 07:37.200]  and that Apple was ripping off subscription app developers
[07:37.200 --> 07:38.800]  by buying Google ads for their things.
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.920]  I think that this is nonsense.
[07:40.920 --> 07:43.200]  To me, I haven't written about it on Daring Fireball yet.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.040]  I've been meaning to,
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.720]  but I thought maybe I should let it cool down.
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.820]  I should at least link to it and give my quick thoughts,
[07:48.820 --> 07:51.200]  but it's also a good podcast topic.
[07:51.200 --> 07:54.000]  But my working draft headline for writing about it
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.340]  is store-caught selling services.
[07:58.340 --> 08:01.120]  It has the rights to sell.
[08:01.120 --> 08:03.400]  Yeah, it's like they put someone's software
[08:03.400 --> 08:05.200]  in an end cap at the grocery store
[08:05.200 --> 08:08.200]  and people are saying, oh, wow, wow, what do you think?
[08:08.200 --> 08:10.600]  You can't put their cereal on that end cap.
[08:10.600 --> 08:13.000]  No, that's got to stay on the shelf where it belongs.
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.200]  I don't understand why people think this is outrageous
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.500]  other than that it's presented as outrageous.
[08:21.500 --> 08:24.040]  You know, like the headline itself
[08:24.040 --> 08:27.680]  sort of implies shadiness.
[08:27.680 --> 08:30.320]  I often flag the word finally.
[08:30.320 --> 08:32.560]  I have like, you know, years long running gag
[08:32.560 --> 08:34.840]  on Daring Fireball where somebody will say,
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.680]  you know, like let's say Safari 15.0 comes out
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.760]  and it breaks scrolling on certain websites.
[08:42.760 --> 08:47.120]  And then a month later, 15.0.1 comes out and fixes the bug.
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.680]  And somebody is going to run a headline,
[08:48.680 --> 08:52.360]  Apple finally fixes scrolling bug in Safari 15, right?
[08:52.360 --> 08:53.560]  And it's like, it was a month.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.000]  You know, what are you talking about?
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.260]  But that's just good fun.
[08:56.260 --> 09:00.120]  But another like word that I feel like is a red flag
[09:00.120 --> 09:02.440]  in a headline is quietly.
[09:02.440 --> 09:03.980]  Apple quietly buying.
[09:03.980 --> 09:05.800]  Number one, it implies they're doing something
[09:05.800 --> 09:09.160]  they want to hide or that they think is shifty or shady
[09:09.160 --> 09:10.280]  or don't want to admit to.
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.160]  But what would it be?
[09:11.160 --> 09:14.520]  What's the non-quiet way of buying Google ads?
[09:14.520 --> 09:16.200]  I don't know.
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.160]  Yeah, it's like what is loudly buying ads look like?
[09:19.160 --> 09:21.080]  When they hit the buy button, they shout.
[09:21.080 --> 09:21.920]  I don't know.
[09:21.920 --> 09:24.720]  Apple is ostentatiously buying Google ads.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.200]  Like should they have written a post
[09:26.200 --> 09:29.120]  on the Apple newsroom site that says
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.560]  Apple is now buying Google ads for the following terms?
[09:32.560 --> 09:35.040]  Should that have been a news article?
[09:35.040 --> 09:35.880]  I mean, and number one,
[09:35.880 --> 09:38.120]  they would have had to run it five years ago
[09:38.120 --> 09:40.280]  because one of the other aspects of this
[09:40.280 --> 09:42.960]  is that Apple's been doing it for five years.
[09:42.960 --> 09:44.080]  Yeah.
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.080]  And it's, then they're doing what they talk about doing.
[09:48.080 --> 09:48.920]  That's the reality.
[09:48.920 --> 09:51.300]  Like so much of the discussion around the App Store
[09:51.300 --> 09:56.300]  and around why Apple feels justified in their 30% cut
[09:56.320 --> 09:58.320]  or whatever cut they get in the App Store
[09:58.320 --> 10:01.640]  is that they do marketing on developers' behalf.
[10:01.640 --> 10:05.220]  That is something that is fundamental to the relationship.
[10:05.220 --> 10:07.040]  They aren't just a payment processor.
[10:07.040 --> 10:11.720]  They are doing marketing and that's a big part of the deal.
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.600]  And it's like this is just Apple doing that
[10:13.600 --> 10:16.440]  in a more outside the App Store way,
[10:16.440 --> 10:20.780]  but Apple shows app icons during keynotes
[10:20.780 --> 10:24.040]  or they'll, on Apple.com, if you go to the iPhone page,
[10:24.040 --> 10:25.480]  go to the Apple Watch page,
[10:25.480 --> 10:27.180]  they'll talk about third-party apps.
[10:27.180 --> 10:30.520]  And that's just marketing and it's outside the App Store
[10:30.520 --> 10:32.200]  and that's part of the deal here.
[10:32.200 --> 10:34.680]  And it seems to be slightly surprising.
[10:34.680 --> 10:36.800]  It almost feels generous that they're actually
[10:36.800 --> 10:40.560]  spending marketing dollars on developers' behalf
[10:40.560 --> 10:42.960]  and you could spin it in a way that they're trying
[10:42.960 --> 10:46.040]  to capture that subscription revenue
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.980]  by getting people to sign up inside the app
[10:47.980 --> 10:51.200]  rather than signing up on the publisher's website.
[10:51.200 --> 10:54.740]  But it's like in order for Apple to get money from this,
[10:54.740 --> 10:57.140]  the publisher is getting the 70%.
[10:57.140 --> 11:00.300]  So it's not like they're coming out behind
[11:00.300 --> 11:02.660]  as a result of this situation.
[11:02.660 --> 11:05.920]  It seems like only upside and if Apple wants to buy ads
[11:05.920 --> 11:08.920]  for my apps, they can take this as my full
[11:08.920 --> 11:10.640]  and clear permission for them to do that
[11:10.640 --> 11:13.900]  whenever they feel so justified to quietly do that.
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.800]  The implication is if Apple weren't buying these,
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.280]  I'll just mention HBO Max,
[11:19.280 --> 11:21.380]  because I tested that one and I think they mentioned it
[11:21.380 --> 11:23.380]  in the article, but like on an iPhone,
[11:23.380 --> 11:26.640]  when you search for HBO Max, there's a chance,
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.320]  in Google, there's a chance that you're one
[11:29.320 --> 11:31.960]  of the top results will be an ad from Apple
[11:31.960 --> 11:34.360]  that says App Store and it goes
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.080]  to like an apps.apple.com slash HBO Max URL
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.320]  and you go to the App Store and if you tap the link
[11:43.320 --> 11:46.920]  and you either download HBO Max or open it
[11:46.920 --> 11:49.900]  if you already have it and why you were Googling
[11:49.900 --> 11:53.120]  for HBO Max and click the ad in that case, I don't know,
[11:53.120 --> 11:55.640]  but then you get the ad, you sign up in the app
[11:55.640 --> 12:00.040]  and then you sign up via your App Store account
[12:00.040 --> 12:02.620]  and then Apple for the first year gets 30%
[12:02.620 --> 12:05.260]  and then after a year, it's 15%
[12:05.260 --> 12:09.300]  and this poor little small independent developer
[12:09.300 --> 12:14.300]  called AT&T just picking on the little guys Apple is
[12:14.960 --> 12:19.680]  only gets 70 and 85% and I guess the implication
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.120]  of the people who think this is scandalous
[12:22.120 --> 12:25.200]  is that if Apple weren't paying for these ads
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.360]  and you search for HBO Max, even if you have an iPhone,
[12:28.360 --> 12:33.000]  that you would go to the actual hbomax.com site
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.400]  or whatever their domain name is and sign up on the web
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.980]  and then AT&T would get 100% of your money
[12:40.980 --> 12:45.020]  minus credit card fees and that every single person
[12:45.020 --> 12:48.480]  who taps the Apple ad and goes through the app
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.200]  and pays through Apple would have otherwise given all
[12:52.200 --> 12:56.080]  of their money to HBO, which I don't think is true at all.
[12:56.080 --> 12:59.720]  Like, it's, I don't think it, it reminds me
[12:59.720 --> 13:01.640]  of like the argument about software piracy
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.720]  from back in the day, there was like an organization
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.420]  called the Software Publishers of America or somebody
[13:07.420 --> 13:10.840]  and they would publish these press releases every year
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.160]  about like the outrageous cost of piracy
[13:14.160 --> 13:18.180]  and that it's costing the industry some absurdly high number
[13:18.180 --> 13:21.160]  of billions of dollars a year because they would just,
[13:21.160 --> 13:23.680]  they would just act as though every single pirated piece
[13:23.680 --> 13:26.960]  of software out there, if not for piracy,
[13:26.960 --> 13:29.960]  would have been paid for at the full retail price,
[13:29.960 --> 13:31.080]  which isn't true.
[13:31.080 --> 13:33.640]  Like when I was in college and I was pirating Photoshop,
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.640]  it wasn't because otherwise I would have spent $500
[13:38.960 --> 13:41.880]  to buy a copy from Adobe, I didn't have $500,
[13:41.880 --> 13:44.120]  I was in college, it was pirated or nothing.
[13:44.120 --> 13:47.720]  I think that the idea that if Apple weren't buying
[13:47.720 --> 13:50.480]  these ads, every single one of these would be a conversion
[13:50.480 --> 13:53.840]  to AT&T at the full price on the web is ridiculous.
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.440]  And it also discounts the fact, it sort of acts
[13:57.440 --> 14:00.440]  as though the user doesn't know the difference either, right?
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.440]  Like there's no dark pattern here where Apple is masquerading
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.200]  as the HBO Max website, right?
[14:09.200 --> 14:11.880]  Like nobody is confused when they tap that ad
[14:11.880 --> 14:15.840]  and they go to the App Store on their phone or iPad,
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.280]  no one's confused about what has just happened.
[14:18.280 --> 14:21.320]  The article would make more sense with its slant
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.640]  if Apple had somehow set up a bunch of shady websites
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.560]  that look like the HBO Max or Hulu or Disney Plus
[14:29.560 --> 14:32.800]  or whatever other keywords or services they're buying for
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.280]  and set up these websites and like was tricking people
[14:36.280 --> 14:38.400]  into signing up for a thing where they get a cut
[14:38.400 --> 14:40.540]  where there's no trickery here at all.
[14:41.680 --> 14:43.280]  Yeah, and it's in that context too,
[14:43.280 --> 14:46.920]  it's like right below the ad is presumably a link
[14:46.920 --> 14:49.800]  to HBOMax.com and they have two options.
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.040]  They can go to the App Store or they can go to the website,
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.000]  both shown on their screen and they're choosing
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.280]  the App Store, like that's a choice they're making
[14:57.280 --> 15:00.240]  consciously and Apple is just informing them
[15:00.240 --> 15:01.640]  that that's an option for this.
[15:01.640 --> 15:05.360]  It's not like by doing this Apple is making it
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.800]  so that it is impossible to find HBOMax.com.
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.600]  It's still right there in the next item down
[15:12.600 --> 15:13.900]  on the Google search results.
[15:13.900 --> 15:18.600]  So it seems a bit sort of a made up controversy.
[15:18.600 --> 15:20.880]  The article at Forbes doesn't say who complained,
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.600]  it just says developers with subscriptions have complained.
[15:24.600 --> 15:26.080]  Let's just say it's HBO Max.
[15:26.080 --> 15:27.500]  I don't know if they're the ones who complained
[15:27.500 --> 15:30.680]  to Forbes or not, but I'll throw anybody owned by AT&T
[15:30.680 --> 15:32.240]  under the bus, they can take it.
[15:32.240 --> 15:35.620]  But let's just say that HBO Max doesn't wanna give any money
[15:35.620 --> 15:38.320]  to Apple for in-app subscriptions.
[15:38.320 --> 15:41.200]  Well then do what Netflix did and take the in-app
[15:41.200 --> 15:43.680]  subscriptions out of your app, right?
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.120]  Like nobody is signing up for Netflix through these web ads
[15:47.120 --> 15:50.000]  for the word Netflix because Netflix stopped taking signups
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.520]  in app years ago because they didn't wanna give Apple
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.720]  the money, you know, the option's right there.
[15:54.720 --> 15:57.360]  Yeah, this is a choice, I got it.
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.120]  It's like you said, it's like an end cap at the supermarket.
[16:01.120 --> 16:03.560]  Like if they're having like a sale on Coca-Cola
[16:03.560 --> 16:05.980]  at the supermarket for Thanksgiving, right?
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.880]  Drink all the Coke you want at Thanksgiving.
[16:07.880 --> 16:11.280]  It's like Coca-Cola can't be mad that the supermarket
[16:11.280 --> 16:14.320]  is advertising Coca-Cola, you're the one who's selling
[16:14.320 --> 16:15.920]  your product through the supermarket.
[16:15.920 --> 16:17.800]  If you don't want them to, then sell, you know,
[16:17.800 --> 16:20.640]  switch to a direct marketing model and sell it all
[16:20.640 --> 16:23.600]  from Atlanta, you know, shipped to your house.
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.400]  Your apps are subscription-based, or at least the ones
[16:27.400 --> 16:30.360]  that are paid, and maybe you're not the best example
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.840]  because your subscriptions are only in-app subscriptions.
[16:34.840 --> 16:37.440]  Like you can't go to the Widgetsmith website
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.520]  and sign up on the web, it's all in-app.
[16:40.520 --> 16:43.800]  But if it were, hypothetically, if you could sign up
[16:43.800 --> 16:47.160]  for Widgetsmith or Pedometer++ on your website,
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.240]  would you mind if Apple advertised the apps?
[16:51.240 --> 16:53.160]  Hell, I mean, I think I would be thrilled.
[16:53.160 --> 16:54.940]  Like, I mean, because from my perspective,
[16:54.940 --> 16:58.000]  like the hardest part of what I do
[16:58.000 --> 16:59.640]  isn't necessarily the making of the app,
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.180]  it's the finding the customer.
[17:01.180 --> 17:04.020]  And if Apple wants to spend money finding customers
[17:04.020 --> 17:07.220]  for my apps, like, I understand that in this context,
[17:07.220 --> 17:09.120]  it's like if they search for Widgetsmith,
[17:09.120 --> 17:11.560]  getting them in the app store and having them convert,
[17:11.560 --> 17:13.760]  like, that's the end result, that's the goal.
[17:13.760 --> 17:15.920]  And if they, clearly, if Apple is spending money
[17:15.920 --> 17:18.120]  on something like this, and has been doing it for years,
[17:18.120 --> 17:20.640]  it works, that people are going into the app
[17:20.640 --> 17:22.560]  and then converting into customers.
[17:22.560 --> 17:25.080]  And so that's kind of the whole,
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.360]  that's the whole game, is to get people
[17:27.360 --> 17:28.560]  and to make them subscribers.
[17:28.560 --> 17:30.000]  And while they're subscribers, great,
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.320]  people are giving you money.
[17:31.320 --> 17:32.640]  And I'm like-
[17:32.640 --> 17:34.240]  Apple, I don't know if you've heard,
[17:34.240 --> 17:36.160]  Apple is really good at getting people
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.680]  to give them money for products and services?
[17:38.680 --> 17:39.520]  Yeah.
[17:39.520 --> 17:42.400]  And so to have them working on your side
[17:42.400 --> 17:45.240]  under the terms you agreed to.
[17:45.240 --> 17:46.060]  Yeah.
[17:46.060 --> 17:46.900]  You know what I mean?
[17:46.900 --> 17:49.080]  It's not like there's somebody at Hulu
[17:49.080 --> 17:52.920]  who's like, what, we're giving 30% to Apple?
[17:52.920 --> 17:53.760]  You know?
[17:53.760 --> 17:54.600]  Yeah.
[17:54.600 --> 17:57.000]  I could not believe that this was a scandal,
[17:57.000 --> 17:58.500]  but there it is.
[17:58.500 --> 18:00.640]  Let me take a break, thank our first sponsor.
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.340]  Previously, sponsor on the show,
[18:02.340 --> 18:03.520]  hasn't been here for a while,
[18:03.520 --> 18:06.280]  happy to have them back, love their product,
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.200]  it's Hullo Pillow, H-U-L-L-O.
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.040]  Hullo Pillow, they make buckwheat pillows.
[18:14.040 --> 18:16.640]  Now, either you've, you've probably not tried one,
[18:16.640 --> 18:17.800]  if you're in America, this is,
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.120]  they're long, long popular in other countries
[18:21.120 --> 18:22.940]  around the world, like in Asia.
[18:22.940 --> 18:25.900]  They are totally different than the fluffy soft pillows
[18:25.900 --> 18:27.520]  most of us are used to.
[18:27.520 --> 18:30.600]  Hullo pillows are buckwheat filled,
[18:30.600 --> 18:34.240]  sort of, best thought of as sort of like a bean bag.
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.460]  It's a lot heavier.
[18:35.460 --> 18:36.520]  You can feel it in there,
[18:36.520 --> 18:38.640]  it's almost like a pillow full of something
[18:38.640 --> 18:39.960]  that from the outside feels like,
[18:39.960 --> 18:42.280]  maybe like coffee beans or something like that.
[18:42.280 --> 18:45.000]  But they're buckwheat, much, much heavier,
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.200]  very, very different.
[18:46.200 --> 18:48.340]  Why would you wanna do that instead of a soft pillow
[18:48.340 --> 18:49.180]  like you're used to?
[18:49.180 --> 18:51.760]  Because they support your head and neck,
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.520]  unlike traditional squishy soft pillows.
[18:53.520 --> 18:55.500]  If you're the sort of person who likes to use two pillows
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.760]  or even three pillows to get your head propped up,
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.720]  one Hullo pillow will probably do the trick.
[19:00.720 --> 19:03.200]  It'll stay firm all through the night.
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.920]  They also stay cool and dry compared to pillows
[19:05.920 --> 19:07.720]  filled with feathers or foam.
[19:07.720 --> 19:11.360]  A buckwheat pillow will stay cool all night long.
[19:11.360 --> 19:13.180]  So like the whole thing, like middle of the night,
[19:13.180 --> 19:14.840]  you wake up and you flip your pillow around
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.860]  to get a cool side.
[19:15.860 --> 19:18.560]  You don't have to do that with a Hullo pillow.
[19:18.560 --> 19:20.120]  People love this pillow.
[19:20.120 --> 19:23.680]  My wife and son both absolutely swear by it.
[19:23.680 --> 19:25.740]  My wife, even though it's a heavy pillow,
[19:25.740 --> 19:28.620]  has even thought about taking it with us when we travel,
[19:28.620 --> 19:30.320]  packing it into a suitcase,
[19:30.320 --> 19:32.840]  because she loves it so much, both of them.
[19:32.840 --> 19:34.920]  When we come back from any trip, staying in a hotel,
[19:34.920 --> 19:37.900]  the first thing they love and mention it every time
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.640]  is they cannot wait to get back to their bed,
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.200]  sleep on their Hullo pillow.
[19:41.200 --> 19:43.000]  Years ago, when they first sponsored the show,
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.320]  they sent us one free.
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.640]  We have bought multiple pillows since.
[19:46.640 --> 19:48.840]  When I told my wife they were sponsoring this episode,
[19:48.840 --> 19:51.620]  she thinks we've bought five, at least five since.
[19:51.620 --> 19:53.880]  All of the old ones are still as good as new.
[19:53.880 --> 19:57.040]  They last forever, but we've put them in our guest room.
[19:57.040 --> 19:59.600]  My son has them, my wife swears by it,
[19:59.600 --> 20:02.480]  but we've turned friends and family members onto them too,
[20:02.480 --> 20:03.900]  and that's why we have them in our guest room,
[20:03.900 --> 20:05.400]  because when people stay over,
[20:05.400 --> 20:08.360]  we know people now that we've sold on Hullo pillows,
[20:08.360 --> 20:09.800]  and now we have them in our guest room
[20:09.800 --> 20:11.680]  so they can enjoy them there too.
[20:11.680 --> 20:12.920]  Just a great product.
[20:12.920 --> 20:13.760]  And here's the deal,
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.900]  they have a sleep on it for 60 nights deal.
[20:15.900 --> 20:18.660]  60 nights, and if Hullo isn't for you,
[20:18.660 --> 20:19.700]  just ship it back to them,
[20:19.700 --> 20:22.220]  and they will give you a full refund, no questions asked.
[20:22.220 --> 20:27.220]  Go to Hullo, H-U-L-L-O, hullopillow.com slash the talk show.
[20:27.760 --> 20:31.400]  And using that link, if you try more than one pillow,
[20:31.400 --> 20:35.300]  get two of them, you can get a discount up to $20 per pillow,
[20:35.300 --> 20:37.320]  depending on the size that you order.
[20:37.320 --> 20:39.060]  Fast, free shipping on every order,
[20:39.060 --> 20:41.120]  and 1% of all of their profits
[20:41.120 --> 20:43.580]  are donated to The Nature Conservancy.
[20:43.580 --> 20:44.980]  So give the gift a better sleep.
[20:44.980 --> 20:47.460]  It's a great gift idea for the holidays,
[20:47.460 --> 20:49.760]  a totally unique idea,
[20:49.760 --> 20:54.760]  and you can get them at hullopillow.com slash the talk show.
[20:57.220 --> 21:00.120]  I wanted to talk to you about Apple Watch.
[21:00.120 --> 21:05.040]  I feel like Apple Watch of the Apple's software platforms
[21:05.040 --> 21:08.200]  is probably the one I talk about the least on the show.
[21:08.200 --> 21:11.400]  Maybe it's proportional to screen size, I don't know.
[21:11.400 --> 21:13.600]  But I've been thinking about Apple Watch a lot,
[21:13.600 --> 21:15.160]  and you had a blog post this week
[21:15.160 --> 21:16.420]  that really made me think, you know what,
[21:16.420 --> 21:19.940]  I should see if David is available to be on the show.
[21:19.940 --> 21:21.460]  Tell me about your blog post.
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.480]  Sure.
[21:22.480 --> 21:24.880]  So, I mean, yeah, I love the Apple Watch.
[21:24.880 --> 21:27.760]  I think it's not necessarily the biggest part
[21:27.760 --> 21:29.760]  of my business, but it's probably the biggest part
[21:29.760 --> 21:32.080]  of my interest as a developer.
[21:32.080 --> 21:33.120]  Like, I just enjoy it.
[21:33.120 --> 21:36.920]  I think it's a really challenging but capable platform.
[21:36.920 --> 21:39.200]  And so it's something that I'm sort of always
[21:40.120 --> 21:41.920]  trying to make sure that I'm taking
[21:41.920 --> 21:43.800]  as best advantage of it as I can.
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.420]  And so the blog post you're writing about is,
[21:45.420 --> 21:49.160]  I just got back from a three-day,
[21:49.160 --> 21:50.820]  went to Scotland, did a lot of hiking,
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.460]  did a lot of camping.
[21:52.460 --> 21:54.420]  There, they would refer to it as wild camping,
[21:54.420 --> 21:56.640]  which I think is an excellent turn of phrase
[21:56.640 --> 21:58.880]  for just sleeping out in the wilderness.
[21:58.880 --> 22:00.440]  But it's like, I'm not backpacking at all.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.340]  I'm a wild camping.
[22:02.340 --> 22:03.280]  I like it.
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.960]  Yeah, it's like, that's what they call it.
[22:04.960 --> 22:06.800]  And so I was on the Scottish Highlands,
[22:06.800 --> 22:08.360]  and I've done this kind of trip before,
[22:08.360 --> 22:11.000]  where I'd go out into the wilderness
[22:11.000 --> 22:11.960]  and hike for a few days.
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.520]  And up until this point, I've never really felt good
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.040]  about bringing an Apple Watch with me,
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.180]  that I'll bring an Apple Watch for day trips,
[22:20.180 --> 22:22.700]  for, you know, like I'm going on a day hike,
[22:22.700 --> 22:23.880]  or from staying in a hotel,
[22:23.880 --> 22:25.960]  and I can charge it up at night.
[22:25.960 --> 22:27.480]  But if I'm going on a trip like this,
[22:27.480 --> 22:30.280]  you know, I'm taking whatever I'm gonna bring with me,
[22:30.280 --> 22:32.280]  you know, on my back, and I'm just heading out.
[22:32.280 --> 22:34.040]  In this case, I was gone for, you know, three days,
[22:34.040 --> 22:37.000]  about 45 miles of just open country.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.080]  During that time, I have to charge my devices,
[22:40.080 --> 22:41.520]  my electronics that I bring with me,
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.680]  just with the, you know, the battery that I bring.
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.000]  I bring like a 20,000 milliamp hour USB battery pack.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.440]  And what's always been tricky with the Apple Watch
[22:50.440 --> 22:51.600]  is I like wearing it.
[22:51.600 --> 22:53.840]  I like that it's so integrated into the way
[22:53.840 --> 22:55.480]  that I track my health and fitness.
[22:55.480 --> 22:56.920]  It can show up in the activity app.
[22:56.920 --> 22:58.200]  It can count my steps in a way
[22:58.200 --> 23:00.500]  that it will appear correctly in Podometer++.
[23:00.500 --> 23:03.240]  It does all the things that I wanna do,
[23:03.240 --> 23:04.620]  but it was always a bit complicated
[23:04.620 --> 23:08.040]  because the Apple Watch just wouldn't give me
[23:08.040 --> 23:10.920]  enough battery life to sort of justify its space
[23:10.920 --> 23:15.320]  in that, you know, in the battery capacity that I bring,
[23:15.320 --> 23:17.240]  you know, because it's competing against things like,
[23:17.240 --> 23:19.320]  and my iPhone, which I might need to use
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.920]  to make an emergency phone call,
[23:20.920 --> 23:23.320]  or I have a satellite emergency beacon
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.720]  that I have to keep charged for the same reason
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.420]  that if I'm from like out in the wilderness
[23:27.420 --> 23:29.540]  and I need to, you know, call for help,
[23:29.540 --> 23:30.920]  those things need to be charged.
[23:30.920 --> 23:33.720]  And so for the Apple Watch to get to that point,
[23:33.720 --> 23:35.200]  it was always a bit tricky,
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.960]  but I wanna have something on my wrist.
[23:37.960 --> 23:40.300]  I like tracking, like having, you know,
[23:40.300 --> 23:43.780]  the GPS track of where I am and being able to know where,
[23:43.780 --> 23:45.260]  you know, it's like where I've been.
[23:45.260 --> 23:48.820]  And so previously I've had to sort of go down the road
[23:48.820 --> 23:50.760]  of what are called adventure watches.
[23:50.760 --> 23:53.380]  Garmin makes several, Suunto is another big company,
[23:53.380 --> 23:56.040]  and the ones that I have are from a company called Coros,
[23:56.040 --> 23:59.680]  which they make these watches that have kind of
[23:59.680 --> 24:04.140]  low resolution displays, but very large battery lives.
[24:04.140 --> 24:07.800]  And, you know, ostensibly you can wear them for trips
[24:07.800 --> 24:09.560]  that would last, you know, probably weeks
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.880]  and be able to do the whole thing on one charge
[24:11.880 --> 24:14.080]  rather than, you know, in my mind,
[24:14.080 --> 24:15.120]  previously with an Apple Watch,
[24:15.120 --> 24:17.760]  it's like I would burn through the entire battery
[24:17.760 --> 24:18.600]  in a single day.
[24:18.600 --> 24:20.520]  And that just makes it really hard
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.800]  if you're going for multi-day trips
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.560]  to have to just keep going, you know,
[24:23.560 --> 24:26.040]  all the way up with charging an Apple Watch, and so.
[24:26.040 --> 24:29.680]  Something more akin to what we've pre-smartwatch
[24:29.680 --> 24:32.280]  thought of as the battery life of a digital watch,
[24:32.280 --> 24:35.280]  even if it is doing some fitness and activity
[24:35.280 --> 24:37.760]  and GPS tracking, but something where you don't,
[24:37.760 --> 24:41.200]  you know, it's almost literally a no-brainer
[24:41.200 --> 24:44.240]  that you just leave without worrying that your watch
[24:44.240 --> 24:46.240]  is gonna run out of battery on the trip.
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:47.400 --> 24:49.760]  It becomes, in some ways it's almost,
[24:49.760 --> 24:51.600]  in my use with these kind of adventure watches,
[24:51.600 --> 24:53.760]  it's the weird difference where sometimes
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.720]  you have to be careful that you don't forget
[24:55.720 --> 24:57.240]  that it needs to be charged.
[24:57.240 --> 24:59.400]  And it can go, it's like with a Kindle or something,
[24:59.400 --> 25:01.600]  where sometimes you can just keep using it
[25:01.600 --> 25:03.040]  and you get to a place that you're like,
[25:03.040 --> 25:05.240]  ah, you just forget that it needs to be charged
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.880]  because you're going weeks in between
[25:07.880 --> 25:08.940]  to sort of charging intervals,
[25:08.940 --> 25:11.020]  which is definitely not an Apple Watch experience.
[25:11.020 --> 25:14.080]  You know, Apple is very big on their all-day battery life,
[25:14.080 --> 25:16.920]  but all-day battery life, you know,
[25:16.920 --> 25:20.560]  traditionally is meant to get 18 hours if you're lucky.
[25:20.560 --> 25:22.340]  And certainly in older Apple Watches,
[25:22.340 --> 25:24.280]  when I've gone on hiking trips with them,
[25:24.280 --> 25:27.420]  you know, when once you're doing a hiking workout,
[25:27.420 --> 25:30.840]  tracking GPS, so it's doing heart rate sampling,
[25:30.840 --> 25:33.240]  you know, continuously tracking your GPS position
[25:33.240 --> 25:35.320]  the whole time, like it would very quickly
[25:36.840 --> 25:38.180]  burn through your Apple Watch.
[25:38.180 --> 25:41.960]  But with the advent of the 45 millimeter Series 7
[25:41.960 --> 25:45.200]  that I sort of got this fall, it got me wondering
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.200]  because the screen on that watch is so bright.
[25:50.200 --> 25:53.200]  All the time, you know, the always-on versus
[25:53.200 --> 25:56.200]  the regular full display are almost identical
[25:56.200 --> 25:58.560]  in a lot of contexts, other than for things like
[25:58.560 --> 26:00.640]  seeing the second hand ticking across.
[26:00.640 --> 26:02.940]  You know, half the time I can't even tell
[26:02.940 --> 26:05.080]  if it's down or up, which made me think,
[26:05.080 --> 26:07.720]  well, if it's that bright all the time,
[26:07.720 --> 26:09.320]  if I can turn that off, so in my case,
[26:09.320 --> 26:10.820]  I just put it on theater mode,
[26:10.820 --> 26:12.800]  which does a pretty good job.
[26:12.800 --> 26:15.320]  It essentially means that the screen doesn't light up at all
[26:15.320 --> 26:16.400]  unless you tap on it.
[26:16.400 --> 26:18.040]  You know, I'm not just turning off the always-on
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.880]  where it would do it with wrist raises.
[26:19.880 --> 26:22.140]  It's just like, it's completely off.
[26:22.140 --> 26:25.200]  Otherwise, if I do that and I put on airplane mode,
[26:25.200 --> 26:26.840]  what kind of battery life could I get?
[26:26.840 --> 26:28.760]  And I was shocked that, you know,
[26:28.760 --> 26:31.780]  I went on this trip, hiked for three days,
[26:31.780 --> 26:34.160]  and like the first day I was out,
[26:34.160 --> 26:37.960]  I hiked for, you know, did 16 miles of hiking
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.340]  over about a six hour period,
[26:39.340 --> 26:43.620]  and it had only used 27% of my battery, which was great.
[26:43.620 --> 26:45.760]  So essentially it changes it from, you know,
[26:45.760 --> 26:48.520]  a all-day battery life to essentially probably like
[26:48.520 --> 26:52.080]  a three-day battery life in this mode with a big,
[26:52.080 --> 26:53.460]  you know, obviously the 45 millimeters,
[26:53.460 --> 26:55.600]  the biggest Apple watch, but still, like,
[26:55.600 --> 26:59.240]  it changed the dynamic for me where it made it clear
[26:59.240 --> 27:03.420]  that this device has huge amounts of potential battery life,
[27:03.420 --> 27:05.400]  and Apple is just choosing right now
[27:05.400 --> 27:07.280]  in normal day-to-day mode,
[27:07.280 --> 27:08.840]  they're choosing to spend that
[27:08.840 --> 27:11.520]  on making the always-on display super bright,
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.080]  but the capacity is there, and if I change my watch
[27:15.080 --> 27:16.960]  and essentially configure it in a few ways to say,
[27:16.960 --> 27:19.760]  hey, what really matters to me right now is battery life,
[27:19.760 --> 27:22.560]  not having a bright screen all the time,
[27:22.560 --> 27:24.960]  or having notifications, or all the things
[27:24.960 --> 27:26.880]  that would normally be jumping up all the time.
[27:26.880 --> 27:28.760]  I care about battery life.
[27:28.760 --> 27:30.300]  Like, it can last a very long time,
[27:30.300 --> 27:32.640]  and it means that I don't need to use an adventure watch.
[27:32.640 --> 27:35.120]  I can just use my Apple watch that I love and I know,
[27:35.120 --> 27:36.920]  and I can write apps for, and I can, you know,
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.080]  if there's a need I have, I can totally solve it.
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.760]  You even wrote a custom app for this wild camping trip.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.000]  Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, it's like in the UK,
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.680]  there's a certain type of map called an Ordnance Survey Map,
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.240]  which is like the gold standard of mapping in the UK,
[27:53.240 --> 27:54.640]  and as far as I know,
[27:54.640 --> 27:58.800]  there is no wrist-mounted version of that map.
[27:58.800 --> 28:01.120]  You can get it on an iPhone or paper maps,
[28:01.120 --> 28:02.760]  but you can't get it on a wrist, and so it's like,
[28:02.760 --> 28:03.840]  well, it's an Apple watch.
[28:03.840 --> 28:05.880]  It's a fully capable programmable computer.
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.440]  I could just write an app that took Ordnance Survey Maps
[28:09.440 --> 28:12.840]  and integrated it with GPS, and I can have live on my wrist
[28:12.840 --> 28:15.520]  an Ordnance Survey Map with GPS and a compass,
[28:15.520 --> 28:18.520]  and, you know, made my navigation super simple,
[28:18.520 --> 28:20.160]  because if I want to know where I am,
[28:20.160 --> 28:22.280]  am I on track, am I come up to a junction,
[28:22.280 --> 28:24.360]  which way should I go, I just raise my wrist,
[28:24.360 --> 28:27.160]  tap on the screen, and there's a map right there
[28:27.160 --> 28:29.480]  exactly centered to precisely where I am,
[28:29.480 --> 28:32.320]  and it's like, I just can't do that on a Coros
[28:32.320 --> 28:34.240]  or a Garmin or anything, and they have some maps,
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.400]  but they don't have these kind of maps,
[28:35.400 --> 28:37.040]  and they're not going to have them on a gorgeous,
[28:37.040 --> 28:40.560]  you know, like edge-to-edge, full-color 60-hertz display
[28:40.560 --> 28:43.880]  that I can pinch to zoom and swipe around with my finger
[28:43.880 --> 28:44.720]  in quite the same way.
[28:44.720 --> 28:46.600]  You've got a screenshot of the app,
[28:46.600 --> 28:50.080]  and I swear, I know it's a long-running joke
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.840]  that I say something will be in the show notes,
[28:51.840 --> 28:53.760]  but I swear it's already in the show notes.
[28:53.760 --> 28:55.600]  It already is, but your blog post is there,
[28:55.600 --> 28:58.040]  people can look at it and see it.
[28:58.040 --> 29:01.600]  I did not know, I don't know why,
[29:01.600 --> 29:04.480]  I guess I should have known, I'm like GPS ignorant.
[29:05.920 --> 29:08.520]  I did not know that when you put something
[29:08.520 --> 29:12.320]  in airplane mode that GPS still can work, or does work.
[29:12.320 --> 29:16.960]  I don't know why, I just thought that would go off.
[29:16.960 --> 29:19.840]  And I guess it's like, in my mind,
[29:19.840 --> 29:23.720]  I still think of GPS as some kind of battery hog technology.
[29:23.720 --> 29:24.560]  Sure.
[29:24.560 --> 29:25.760]  And I guess it's not.
[29:26.720 --> 29:30.520]  Yeah, I mean, I think it works in airplane mode
[29:30.520 --> 29:32.960]  because it's entirely passive, it's just listening.
[29:32.960 --> 29:35.680]  It's not sending data up to the satellites
[29:35.680 --> 29:38.280]  that are doing the geolocation,
[29:38.280 --> 29:41.960]  and so it's able to be on in airplane mode.
[29:41.960 --> 29:44.040]  And airplane mode is primarily just about
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.520]  what your phone is sending.
[29:45.520 --> 29:49.120]  And so it turns off wifi, it turns off cellular.
[29:49.120 --> 29:50.880]  You can optionally have it turn off Bluetooth.
[29:50.880 --> 29:52.040]  In this case, I just left it on
[29:52.040 --> 29:54.520]  because Bluetooth is so low energy these days.
[29:54.520 --> 29:55.760]  But yeah, it is kind of a funny thing,
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.120]  and I wasn't sure at first,
[29:57.120 --> 29:58.920]  but it's like I turned it on in airplane mode
[29:58.920 --> 30:00.400]  on my phone and on my watch,
[30:00.400 --> 30:02.640]  and then went for a hike and it tracked it,
[30:02.640 --> 30:04.640]  and I was like, okay, well, I guess GPS works
[30:04.640 --> 30:07.160]  because it's just listening rather than having
[30:07.160 --> 30:09.400]  to do any transmission.
[30:09.400 --> 30:11.320]  The other thing I wouldn't have thought of
[30:11.320 --> 30:15.200]  is using theater mode to do this battery saving.
[30:15.200 --> 30:18.280]  I would have just thought go to settings,
[30:18.280 --> 30:20.680]  display and brightness, and on the watch,
[30:20.680 --> 30:23.200]  you can turn off always on mode.
[30:23.200 --> 30:27.360]  And then the difference is if you go to settings
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.600]  and turn off always on, the watch face
[30:29.600 --> 30:32.040]  will still light up on wrist rays.
[30:32.040 --> 30:35.120]  And with theater mode, you actually have to tap the screen
[30:35.120 --> 30:38.800]  or move the crown or something to see the display.
[30:38.800 --> 30:41.200]  And I could see why in your scenario,
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.920]  wild camping and hiking, you might wanna do that
[30:43.920 --> 30:46.080]  because I would imagine while you're hiking,
[30:46.080 --> 30:49.800]  the watch might light up with a fake wrist raise
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.040]  just because you're maneuvering around a tricky part
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.800]  in the path or something like that.
[30:55.800 --> 30:58.160]  Yeah, and clearly Apple's algorithms
[30:58.160 --> 31:00.720]  and heuristics are tuned to make it
[31:00.720 --> 31:03.560]  so that every time I raise my wrist, it lights up.
[31:03.560 --> 31:05.980]  That they wanna make absolutely sure
[31:05.980 --> 31:09.160]  that every single time you do that, that happens.
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.840]  And so they've tuned it so that that's 100%
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.880]  and then there's gonna be a few false negatives
[31:13.880 --> 31:16.080]  or false positives where it's lighting up
[31:16.080 --> 31:19.560]  when my wrist isn't actually being intended to be looked at.
[31:19.560 --> 31:23.040]  And in my case, it's like I will take that trade off
[31:23.040 --> 31:26.280]  and turn it around where I'm happy to be very intentional
[31:26.280 --> 31:27.640]  that I wanna check my distance,
[31:27.640 --> 31:29.360]  I wanna check where I am on the map,
[31:29.360 --> 31:31.120]  I wanna do those things consciously
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.520]  because having the battery life on my watch
[31:33.520 --> 31:36.080]  last that much longer is way more important to me
[31:36.080 --> 31:39.200]  than the ergonomic benefit of only having
[31:39.200 --> 31:41.160]  to slightly raise my wrist.
[31:41.160 --> 31:42.600]  Especially honestly, because I'm hiking
[31:42.600 --> 31:44.600]  with hiking poles and stuff, I have things in my hand.
[31:44.600 --> 31:46.920]  So it's kind of, I don't actually necessarily turn my wrist
[31:46.920 --> 31:49.080]  in quite the same exaggerated fashion
[31:49.080 --> 31:51.840]  because I'll hit something with my hiking poles.
[31:51.840 --> 31:53.600]  So it makes a lot more sense for me
[31:53.600 --> 31:57.280]  to just tap the screen whenever I wanna check things.
[32:00.200 --> 32:02.880]  And I guess I'm surprised that you got
[32:02.880 --> 32:04.340]  as much battery life as you did.
[32:04.340 --> 32:06.400]  And I guess I shouldn't be, because we know
[32:06.400 --> 32:08.080]  that battery life has gotten better
[32:08.080 --> 32:09.680]  on the Apple Watch steadily.
[32:11.180 --> 32:14.080]  I mean, the Series Zero original Apple Watch
[32:14.080 --> 32:16.560]  is probably about as close as we could get
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.800]  to the Apple version of a minimal viable product.
[32:22.300 --> 32:27.300]  It's hard to imagine that if it were slower
[32:27.520 --> 32:30.760]  or had even slightly worse battery life
[32:30.760 --> 32:33.200]  that they could have brought it to market when they did.
[32:33.200 --> 32:35.120]  It was very slow.
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.280]  Everything you did on it was very slow,
[32:37.280 --> 32:41.020]  especially communication from the phone to the watch.
[32:41.020 --> 32:43.280]  Even so, with all of the concessions
[32:43.280 --> 32:46.040]  they made to battery life, like having the display go off
[32:46.040 --> 32:49.200]  when you're not looking at it, and using OLED screens
[32:49.200 --> 32:51.400]  with black background watch faces
[32:51.400 --> 32:54.600]  that are as low power as possible on OLED,
[32:54.600 --> 32:58.460]  all of those tricks, it still barely made it through a day,
[32:58.460 --> 33:01.600]  especially if you did even a single workout.
[33:01.600 --> 33:04.880]  And doing a workout would noticeably drain the battery
[33:04.880 --> 33:06.920]  because it would be monitoring your heartbeat
[33:06.920 --> 33:11.920]  more frequently and whatever other type of detection
[33:12.200 --> 33:14.260]  it's doing, like trying to detect distance
[33:14.260 --> 33:17.200]  while you walk or jog or something like that.
[33:17.200 --> 33:19.280]  Slowly and steadily, every single year,
[33:19.280 --> 33:21.000]  it's gotten faster and faster,
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.840]  and to the point now where I don't really feel
[33:23.840 --> 33:26.440]  like anything feels slow on Apple Watch.
[33:26.440 --> 33:30.220]  Sometimes I still, and I'm sure you see this as a developer,
[33:30.220 --> 33:33.040]  I still sometimes run into a thing where it's like
[33:33.040 --> 33:34.680]  I just restarted it or something,
[33:34.680 --> 33:39.680]  and one of my complications just is not getting information.
[33:40.760 --> 33:42.560]  And it's like, I don't know what to do here.
[33:42.560 --> 33:45.040]  I've opened the app on my phone, I've opened it on a watch,
[33:45.040 --> 33:46.400]  and then all of a sudden it'll start working.
[33:46.400 --> 33:47.600]  And it's like, I don't know what that is.
[33:47.600 --> 33:48.980]  But for the most part, though,
[33:48.980 --> 33:50.660]  things that should be fast are fast,
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.400]  and battery life has gotten better.
[33:52.400 --> 33:55.040]  But you can just tell that internally,
[33:55.040 --> 33:57.800]  Apple, for all of their devices,
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.280]  and of course every company would do this,
[33:59.280 --> 34:02.480]  but you figure, here's how much battery we have,
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.480]  and then you effectively make a budget.
[34:04.480 --> 34:06.080]  What do we want to spend it on?
[34:06.080 --> 34:10.720]  And Apple has sort of kept one full day of battery life
[34:10.720 --> 34:14.200]  as their North Star, and then they've sort of
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.680]  filled in that day by doing more.
[34:17.680 --> 34:19.920]  Okay, we'll leave the screen on all the time,
[34:19.920 --> 34:21.200]  even when you're not looking at it,
[34:21.200 --> 34:24.200]  but it'll be really dim with the Series 5.
[34:24.200 --> 34:27.360]  And then in Series 6, we'll make that always-on mode
[34:27.360 --> 34:29.640]  a little brighter, and now with Series 7,
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.320]  it's really quite bright.
[34:31.320 --> 34:34.640]  Yeah, I mean, for many watch faces,
[34:34.640 --> 34:38.140]  I can't tell the difference between the wrist down
[34:38.140 --> 34:40.020]  and the wrist up version, other than the second hand.
[34:40.020 --> 34:41.860]  Like, if you don't look at it closely,
[34:41.860 --> 34:43.360]  you just wouldn't know.
[34:43.360 --> 34:46.000]  And clearly, that's using a lot of energy,
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.380]  but I mean, the nature of, there are some things
[34:48.380 --> 34:50.360]  that you can do to optimize, like to your point,
[34:50.360 --> 34:53.600]  they can make it faster, but the energy it takes
[34:53.600 --> 34:57.040]  to shoot light out of the screen is kind of a fixed thing.
[34:57.040 --> 34:59.120]  And so if they've gotten to a point that they can
[34:59.120 --> 35:02.880]  send those photons out of the screen on a continuous basis
[35:02.880 --> 35:05.040]  throughout the entire time that the watch is on,
[35:05.040 --> 35:06.600]  it's like, clearly they have a good amount
[35:06.600 --> 35:09.200]  of budget available, and it's like, in this context,
[35:09.200 --> 35:12.680]  I make different choices about how to spend that budget.
[35:12.680 --> 35:14.880]  The watch is capable of kind of being adaptable
[35:14.880 --> 35:15.700]  between the two.
[35:15.700 --> 35:17.160]  It's like, in day-to-day use, I think Apple made
[35:17.160 --> 35:20.720]  the absolutely right choice that the Series 7 watch
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.240]  is, in my use, feels really different, even to a 6,
[35:25.240 --> 35:27.440]  where it's bright to a point that it feels like
[35:27.440 --> 35:30.160]  the screen is always on, like actually always on,
[35:30.160 --> 35:33.120]  not there's these two modes, and when you jump
[35:33.120 --> 35:36.280]  between them, the watch face shrinks and grows,
[35:36.280 --> 35:38.600]  and it's these two distinct things.
[35:38.600 --> 35:40.920]  It feels much more like those two distinctions
[35:40.920 --> 35:43.360]  are kind of separate now, and it's much more,
[35:43.360 --> 35:45.760]  it's just always on, and it's great,
[35:45.760 --> 35:47.520]  but in a context where you don't want it,
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.280]  that budget is available, and you can spend it
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.920]  doing all kinds of other things.
[35:50.920 --> 35:53.080]  I wasn't gonna buy a new watch this year.
[35:53.080 --> 35:56.320]  I had, my previous purchase was a Series 5
[35:56.320 --> 35:58.440]  from two years ago, which I bought specifically
[35:58.440 --> 36:00.980]  for always-on mode, because it had been something
[36:00.980 --> 36:04.720]  I had complained about in my reviews of the Series 0,
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.440]  the Series 2, Series 3, Series 4, and so I felt like
[36:08.440 --> 36:10.520]  once they shipped one with it, well, I better buy one,
[36:10.520 --> 36:12.840]  because I've been complaining about it for four years,
[36:12.840 --> 36:16.340]  and did not regret it, but still thought it was fine.
[36:16.340 --> 36:18.400]  Series 6 last year, it certainly didn't tempt me
[36:18.400 --> 36:20.840]  for a one-year over a one-year update,
[36:20.840 --> 36:22.800]  just because it was a little brighter,
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.140]  but here's where the danger of being a,
[36:26.140 --> 36:28.280]  it's such a privilege, and I love doing it,
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.320]  but getting to review these products all the time,
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.760]  it's like having worn a Series 7 that I had no intention
[36:35.760 --> 36:38.920]  of buying for a couple of weeks, I was like, I need this,
[36:38.920 --> 36:41.760]  because the battery life was so much better,
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.280]  and the always-on glanceable, don't even have to raise
[36:45.280 --> 36:47.080]  my wrist, I can easily see what time it is,
[36:47.080 --> 36:50.040]  was so much better, including outdoors,
[36:50.040 --> 36:52.400]  that when I went back to my personal Series 5,
[36:52.400 --> 36:57.400]  it felt like somebody came in and depleted my battery.
[36:58.200 --> 37:01.840]  It's like, aw, you poor thing, I liked you so much
[37:01.840 --> 37:04.700]  before I spent a couple of weeks with a Series 7.
[37:06.200 --> 37:07.780]  The one thing that's weird to me,
[37:07.780 --> 37:09.500]  and I don't know why they do it,
[37:09.500 --> 37:11.100]  I don't think it's every watch face,
[37:11.100 --> 37:13.780]  but my favorite watch face is utility,
[37:13.780 --> 37:17.580]  and utility does it, is when it goes to always-on mode,
[37:17.580 --> 37:22.240]  it shrinks just a little, like maybe like 5%.
[37:22.240 --> 37:24.160]  And then when you raise your wrist,
[37:24.160 --> 37:26.520]  it doesn't just get brighter, it grows,
[37:26.520 --> 37:29.360]  and the complications bounce a little.
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.160]  So like on utility, you can have a text complication
[37:33.160 --> 37:36.600]  at the bottom that wraps around the watch face part,
[37:36.600 --> 37:39.200]  and that text part shrinks and grows,
[37:39.200 --> 37:41.120]  and it has a nice little animation,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.120]  like ease in, ease out type thing.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.560]  But it's the thing that makes the always-on transition
[37:49.560 --> 37:52.000]  more noticeable than if they just made it brighter.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.680]  It's so bright, it's almost like it made more sense
[37:54.680 --> 37:58.360]  for Series 5 when there was a much more distinct difference
[37:58.360 --> 38:01.080]  in brightness, and now it feels almost like
[38:01.080 --> 38:02.620]  they're drawing attention to a thing
[38:02.620 --> 38:04.680]  that shouldn't have attention drawn to it.
[38:04.680 --> 38:08.880]  Yeah, it drives me crazy, and it's something that,
[38:08.880 --> 38:11.100]  I really wish they would just stop doing that
[38:11.100 --> 38:13.680]  on the Series 7, it was one of the first things I noticed
[38:13.680 --> 38:17.040]  when I got the watch that it made sense on the Series 5
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.040]  where they really were distinct states,
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.160]  and on many of the faces, Apple was making
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.480]  meaningful changes to it, like they would hollow out
[38:26.480 --> 38:29.480]  parts of the UI, or they would do things to save power,
[38:29.480 --> 38:31.740]  but if you're in a place where the two
[38:31.740 --> 38:33.920]  are essentially identical, and it's not really
[38:33.920 --> 38:36.300]  anything changing except this having the second hand
[38:36.300 --> 38:39.380]  sort of fade in and out, it feels, yeah,
[38:39.380 --> 38:40.760]  it feels kind of pointless to do,
[38:40.760 --> 38:42.660]  and I hope at some point that goes away,
[38:42.660 --> 38:45.100]  or it's an option that happens, or something,
[38:45.100 --> 38:47.560]  but it definitely bothers me too,
[38:47.560 --> 38:49.600]  that on a lot of these faces, it doesn't have to work
[38:49.600 --> 38:52.760]  that way, and especially I see this in WatchOS 8,
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.660]  Apple added the ability for third party apps
[38:54.660 --> 38:56.540]  to integrate with the always on display,
[38:56.540 --> 38:59.600]  and in my own apps, I can experiment with what it's like
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.160]  between making the UI change dramatically between the two,
[39:03.160 --> 39:05.680]  and I found on a Series 7, the best thing to do
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.120]  is to make as few changes as possible,
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.160]  and it makes it feel like the watch is just
[39:10.160 --> 39:13.000]  sort of always ready for you, and it feels
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.160]  way more responsive and capable as a result.
[39:15.160 --> 39:17.840]  I like one of the changes, and it makes sense,
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.640]  but let's say you have a solid color background,
[39:22.640 --> 39:25.560]  like there's a watch face called color,
[39:25.560 --> 39:28.960]  and your entire watch face from round corner
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.080]  to round corner is blue, when it goes to always on,
[39:32.080 --> 39:34.320]  that goes to black for power saving reasons
[39:34.320 --> 39:36.840]  because black is low power, that makes sense,
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.960]  but if you already have one of the more typical
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.520]  or probably more common watch faces with a black background,
[39:43.520 --> 39:45.760]  it doesn't really make sense to worry about that
[39:45.760 --> 39:47.320]  at this point, in my opinion.
[39:47.320 --> 39:48.680]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.600]  The other thing, and while we're talking about the corners,
[39:52.600 --> 39:55.820]  and it occurred to me to want to talk about Apple Watch
[39:55.820 --> 39:58.380]  this week on the show is just,
[39:59.520 --> 40:01.120]  my mother-in-law was asking me for tips
[40:01.120 --> 40:04.860]  she's buying somebody else a gift, an Apple Watch gift,
[40:04.860 --> 40:08.680]  and wanted my advice on which one to get,
[40:08.680 --> 40:11.800]  and she was leaning towards the Series 3
[40:11.800 --> 40:14.260]  because there was some kind of promotion she saw somewhere
[40:14.260 --> 40:15.980]  where it was only 150 bucks,
[40:15.980 --> 40:17.400]  but that's too good to be true,
[40:17.400 --> 40:19.520]  and when she actually clicked through,
[40:19.520 --> 40:22.640]  it was actually $195,
[40:22.640 --> 40:25.520]  which is only $5 less than Apple's retail price
[40:25.520 --> 40:26.660]  for the Series 3,
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.920]  and I talked her into buying this person
[40:31.920 --> 40:36.800]  at the Apple Watch SE, which is $280.
[40:36.800 --> 40:40.480]  Everybody complained after the keynote in September,
[40:40.480 --> 40:42.640]  everybody's de-jerk reaction was,
[40:42.640 --> 40:44.640]  ah, still the Series 3?
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.520]  Two months later, it's even more annoying to me
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.040]  because I see the problems that a typical non-expert,
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.280]  somebody who doesn't have John Gruber as their son-in-law
[40:57.280 --> 41:00.800]  to ask for advice, that they might buy one,
[41:00.800 --> 41:04.400]  and percentage-wise, going from 200 to 280
[41:04.400 --> 41:05.880]  is pretty significant, right?
[41:05.880 --> 41:09.840]  I mean, that's a 40% increase in price.
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.120]  So I get it, right?
[41:11.120 --> 41:13.560]  And it's easy for me to spend other people's money
[41:13.560 --> 41:15.340]  and tell my mother-in-law to spend it,
[41:15.340 --> 41:18.040]  but once I explained to her some of the differences
[41:18.040 --> 41:20.480]  and that it just was gonna have way more of a future
[41:20.480 --> 41:22.760]  ahead of it and significantly better battery life,
[41:22.760 --> 41:24.520]  she was like, okay, that's worth it.
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.520]  But as a developer, somebody who writes watch complications
[41:29.600 --> 41:32.580]  and even custom apps for the Apple Watch,
[41:32.580 --> 41:34.800]  I'll bet your custom app does not support Series 3.
[41:34.800 --> 41:37.640]  Tell me the frustrations you have as a developer
[41:37.640 --> 41:42.640]  still supporting Series 3 and knowing that the kick
[41:42.840 --> 41:45.040]  in the pants in September, two months ago,
[41:45.040 --> 41:48.600]  if they said Series 3 is still the base model,
[41:48.600 --> 41:50.480]  then it's not just that they're gonna sell it
[41:50.480 --> 41:52.440]  for the next year, but they're gonna support it
[41:52.440 --> 41:54.560]  for a couple of years after that.
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.440]  Yes, I mean, I think that's the part of it
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.440]  that it doesn't change necessarily right now
[42:01.440 --> 42:02.260]  what I would do.
[42:02.260 --> 42:04.700]  I mean, it's frustrating, and I really don't like supporting
[42:04.700 --> 42:06.120]  a Series 3 Apple Watch
[42:06.120 --> 42:08.240]  because the screen is totally different, it's tiny,
[42:08.240 --> 42:10.960]  the device is slower, but really, yeah,
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.400]  that even if they stop selling it, say, next fall,
[42:15.400 --> 42:18.540]  that it goes away, it probably is gonna be something
[42:18.540 --> 42:22.160]  that watchOS supports for at least another year after that,
[42:22.160 --> 42:23.040]  and that's optimistic.
[42:23.040 --> 42:24.880]  Realistically, I think it's gonna be another two years
[42:24.880 --> 42:28.400]  after that, and it's continuing to sell well.
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.580]  Users of Pedometer++, which is probably the best case
[42:31.580 --> 42:33.040]  for judging this kind of thing,
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.920]  is about 20% of Apple Watch users are on a Series 3.
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.320]  That's a meaningful percentage,
[42:39.320 --> 42:41.760]  and it's not getting very much smaller over time.
[42:41.760 --> 42:44.160]  I think what really frustrates me about the Apple Watch,
[42:44.160 --> 42:45.960]  Series 3 sticking around, is there's parts
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.560]  of the development part that I don't like,
[42:47.560 --> 42:50.440]  that obviously it's annoying, it's a different thing.
[42:50.440 --> 42:54.360]  I can make better apps on the modern rounded corner,
[42:54.360 --> 42:57.760]  sort of edge-to-edge screens that are more capable.
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.800]  I can do a lot more with that, and that's exciting to me,
[42:59.800 --> 43:01.880]  and it's annoying that when I do a design,
[43:01.880 --> 43:03.440]  essentially I have to come up with two designs,
[43:03.440 --> 43:06.080]  one for the Series 3 and one for everything else.
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.200]  It annoys me what the impression the Series 3 gives people
[43:10.200 --> 43:11.720]  of what an Apple Watch can be,
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.840]  because an Apple Watch, I think, is a great device
[43:14.840 --> 43:17.640]  that can do so many things, it can be so many,
[43:17.640 --> 43:19.520]  do you take lots of different roles,
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.560]  that it can be something that is just a notification hub
[43:23.560 --> 43:24.720]  if you're super connected,
[43:24.720 --> 43:26.240]  it can be a health management thing,
[43:26.240 --> 43:28.560]  it can be something that's trying to,
[43:28.560 --> 43:30.680]  I love that both of my parents wear an Apple Watch
[43:30.680 --> 43:34.400]  that has fall detection on it, that makes me feel good,
[43:34.400 --> 43:36.640]  and that's kind of important,
[43:36.640 --> 43:39.240]  but a Series 3 doesn't have a lot of that stuff,
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.440]  it doesn't have the ECG,
[43:41.440 --> 43:43.240]  it doesn't have blood oxygen sensor,
[43:43.240 --> 43:46.360]  I'm not sure it can do fall detection, actually,
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.200]  and so often I feel like Apple does this great trick
[43:51.200 --> 43:53.480]  in the app, since you go into the Apple Store
[43:53.480 --> 43:55.440]  and there's a good, better, best,
[43:55.440 --> 43:57.600]  and that works really well because you're always coming out
[43:57.600 --> 44:00.720]  with something good, at least.
[44:00.720 --> 44:02.560]  I feel like the current structure in the Apple Store
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.080]  is it's like, it's kind of bad, alright, and excellent,
[44:07.080 --> 44:09.480]  and that doesn't feel as good,
[44:09.480 --> 44:12.440]  that I think if your first Apple Watch was a Series 3,
[44:12.440 --> 44:14.360]  it's souring you a little bit to it,
[44:14.360 --> 44:16.400]  and obviously the Series 3 was great at its time,
[44:16.400 --> 44:19.200]  that it's like, I'm judging it
[44:19.200 --> 44:20.840]  because I know what's possible,
[44:20.840 --> 44:22.680]  not necessarily on its own.
[44:22.680 --> 44:27.400]  If the Series 7 or the SE or the 4 or 5 didn't exist,
[44:27.400 --> 44:29.560]  then the Series 3 was a good product,
[44:29.560 --> 44:31.640]  and that would have had different expectations
[44:31.640 --> 44:34.240]  for what your Apple Watch life could be,
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.000]  and so it's kind of just a frustrating thing
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  that it's gonna be there and it's gonna be used
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.400]  by a lot of people for a long time,
[44:41.400 --> 44:45.560]  and obviously it's easy for me to say,
[44:45.560 --> 44:46.880]  oh, they should have just gotten rid of it
[44:46.880 --> 44:49.160]  and dropped it down, but it's like,
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.520]  I think in my ideal world, we would be in a place
[44:51.520 --> 44:53.760]  where all of the Apple Watches would have always on now,
[44:53.760 --> 44:55.600]  that it would be, the three for sale
[44:55.600 --> 44:57.760]  would be the Series 7, 6, and 5,
[44:57.760 --> 44:59.520]  like, you can't make a wrong choice there.
[44:59.520 --> 45:01.320]  You would just sort of be trading off
[45:01.320 --> 45:02.400]  on what sensors you have,
[45:02.400 --> 45:04.600]  or if you want an edge-to-edge screen,
[45:04.600 --> 45:05.720]  and that would be great,
[45:05.720 --> 45:07.960]  and that's sort of what we have on the iPhone side,
[45:07.960 --> 45:09.480]  but it's just, it really frustrates me
[45:09.480 --> 45:12.360]  that that's not what we have for the Apple Watch.
[45:12.360 --> 45:13.840]  It feels like there's a little bit
[45:13.840 --> 45:18.560]  of product marketing spite in the limitations of the SE,
[45:18.560 --> 45:23.560]  because the SE is sort of based on the Series 5,
[45:23.560 --> 45:28.560]  the Series 5, but it's like a Series 5 spec-wise,
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.680]  minus certain features, right?
[45:31.680 --> 45:33.720]  Minus the always on screen,
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.680]  minus the EKG, ECG, whatever the initials are for that.
[45:41.280 --> 45:43.040]  Whereas with the iPhone,
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.400]  when they've come out with SE models both times,
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.360]  it was a better version of the thing that it was based on.
[45:50.360 --> 45:54.720]  So the original SE was based on the 5S form factor,
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.760]  but it was a faster 5S,
[45:56.760 --> 46:00.440]  and the current iPhone SE is based on,
[46:02.160 --> 46:04.760]  I guess, an iPhone 8.
[46:04.760 --> 46:05.600]  Is that right?
[46:05.600 --> 46:06.440]  Yes, I think so.
[46:06.440 --> 46:07.440]  It's like an iPhone 8
[46:07.440 --> 46:10.000]  with last year's A-series system on a chip.
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.680]  So it's like an iPhone 8, but faster,
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.560]  whereas it's not that the SE Watch is slower.
[46:16.560 --> 46:17.680]  It's the same speed,
[46:17.680 --> 46:20.240]  but it is missing some pretty cool features,
[46:20.240 --> 46:22.040]  and so it's bad enough
[46:22.040 --> 46:24.200]  that it's that far behind the state of the art
[46:24.200 --> 46:26.920]  with no always on and no ECG
[46:27.880 --> 46:30.480]  if that were the base model at 199,
[46:30.480 --> 46:33.120]  let alone that there's the Series 3.
[46:33.120 --> 46:36.160]  In general, I mean, people get frustrated
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.360]  with, Android phone makers have been notorious.
[46:39.360 --> 46:40.800]  I think they've gotten better about it,
[46:40.800 --> 46:43.840]  but everybody who's followed tech for the last decade
[46:43.840 --> 46:47.400]  of the smartphone era knows that Android phones
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.800]  tend not to get OS updates as many years into the future
[46:51.800 --> 46:53.800]  as some people would like,
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.640]  and Apple has done an increasingly better job of that,
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.080]  of keeping older devices running great.
[47:01.080 --> 47:02.720]  There used to be a reputation
[47:02.720 --> 47:05.240]  that if you had like a four or five-year-old iPhone
[47:05.240 --> 47:07.200]  and updated the OS, sure, they'll give it to you,
[47:07.200 --> 47:08.480]  but everything runs real slow
[47:08.480 --> 47:11.320]  because they didn't really test it well or something.
[47:11.320 --> 47:13.200]  There was something to that.
[47:13.200 --> 47:16.160]  Whereas for some benchmarks for a post,
[47:16.160 --> 47:17.920]  I actually still haven't gotten around
[47:17.920 --> 47:18.760]  to publishing last week.
[47:18.760 --> 47:21.680]  I actually charged up a bunch of my older iPhones,
[47:22.720 --> 47:26.640]  and I upgraded my iPhone 10 to iOS 15.
[47:26.640 --> 47:28.000]  It runs great.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.400]  There's absolutely no hiccups.
[47:29.400 --> 47:31.480]  It's actually really great.
[47:31.480 --> 47:34.960]  My son had been using an iPhone 10 until recently.
[47:34.960 --> 47:38.280]  We got him this year's new one, and he had no complaints,
[47:38.280 --> 47:42.040]  and it was his years-old iPhone 10
[47:42.040 --> 47:44.360]  running the latest OS was running great.
[47:44.360 --> 47:45.680]  We praise Apple for that,
[47:45.680 --> 47:46.800]  and I think they deserve it,
[47:46.800 --> 47:48.040]  and I think they do a better job
[47:48.040 --> 47:50.280]  than any of their competition.
[47:50.280 --> 47:51.720]  But on the other hand, the flip side
[47:51.720 --> 47:54.520]  is that sinking feeling of, well,
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.080]  that means if they're selling the iPhone,
[47:56.080 --> 47:57.280]  the Series 3 right now,
[47:57.280 --> 48:00.520]  it's gonna be around for two or three years to come at least.
[48:00.520 --> 48:01.800]  Yeah.
[48:01.800 --> 48:04.040]  Yeah, and it's just disheartening.
[48:04.040 --> 48:06.720]  And the other thing that Apple doesn't do
[48:06.720 --> 48:08.760]  is, like you said, at their best,
[48:08.760 --> 48:11.960]  and Steve Jobs would say it,
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.480]  it was explicit on the slides in many of the older keynotes,
[48:15.480 --> 48:16.800]  good, better, best,
[48:16.800 --> 48:19.920]  and that the worst thing you'll come out with is good.
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.840]  It's really hard to say that the Series 3 is good.
[48:22.840 --> 48:24.320]  I mean, people might enjoy it,
[48:24.320 --> 48:27.440]  but not knowing what they could be enjoying, right?
[48:27.440 --> 48:29.760]  In the same way that when the Series 3 was brand new,
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.840]  everybody was like, oh, man, this is so much better
[48:31.840 --> 48:34.800]  than the first two generations of Apple Watch.
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.080]  Yeah.
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.840]  And the other thing, too, is Apple doesn't give you,
[48:39.840 --> 48:42.360]  I mean, there's so many Apple stores now,
[48:42.360 --> 48:43.640]  and so many people work there,
[48:43.640 --> 48:45.720]  that maybe somebody's got a horror story
[48:45.720 --> 48:47.880]  of getting a bad Apple employee
[48:47.880 --> 48:49.720]  who upsold them on something,
[48:49.720 --> 48:51.520]  but in my experience,
[48:51.520 --> 48:54.960]  Apple never badmouths any of their products, you know?
[48:54.960 --> 48:56.000]  So they're not going to,
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.800]  if you come in there and really seem hell-bent
[48:57.800 --> 49:00.760]  on spending only $199 on a Series 3,
[49:00.760 --> 49:03.600]  they'll be happy to tell you what you would get
[49:03.600 --> 49:07.280]  and tell you what the features are in the Apple Watch SE
[49:07.280 --> 49:08.600]  that are better and might be,
[49:08.600 --> 49:10.800]  you might think are worth 80 bucks,
[49:10.800 --> 49:13.720]  but they're not going to talk you out of the Series 3.
[49:13.720 --> 49:14.560]  Yeah.
[49:14.560 --> 49:16.600]  Which in general is good, you know,
[49:16.600 --> 49:20.320]  that if you really want like a $999 MacBook Air,
[49:20.320 --> 49:21.560]  which is a great computer,
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.760]  and you really don't need more RAM
[49:24.760 --> 49:26.480]  or more than the default storage,
[49:26.480 --> 49:27.880]  they'll just happily sell it to you,
[49:27.880 --> 49:30.520]  and you might be very happy,
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.640]  you should probably be very happy with it.
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.520]  Whereas the Series 3, hmm, feels a little,
[49:36.520 --> 49:39.040]  and again, I'm sure there's a complicated backstory.
[49:39.040 --> 49:41.600]  Who knows if COVID made it worse, you know,
[49:41.600 --> 49:43.480]  and maybe there was a plan for the SE
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.440]  to move further down the pipeline to $199,
[49:48.520 --> 49:50.720]  but it's like the one sour note
[49:50.720 --> 49:53.160]  in the whole current Apple Watch lineup.
[49:54.240 --> 49:55.080]  Yeah.
[49:55.080 --> 49:55.920]  All right, let me take a break here.
[49:55.920 --> 49:57.480]  Thank our next sponsor.
[49:57.480 --> 49:59.760]  It's another repeat sponsor from way back.
[49:59.760 --> 50:02.000]  Love this company, Hover.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.040]  Hover is the best domain registrar in the world.
[50:06.040 --> 50:08.600]  It's a great jumping off point for a ton of entrepreneurs
[50:08.600 --> 50:09.600]  starting a new business,
[50:09.600 --> 50:11.840]  but also for hobbyists and enthusiasts,
[50:11.840 --> 50:14.160]  somebody is just making a website for themselves
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.040]  or for a gag or for an app or whatever you're doing.
[50:18.040 --> 50:20.920]  If you need a website, you need a domain name,
[50:20.920 --> 50:23.560]  and Hover is a great place to get started.
[50:23.560 --> 50:27.240]  They offer over 300 domain name extensions
[50:27.240 --> 50:29.120]  to choose from when building your brand online.
[50:29.120 --> 50:31.040]  I remember when there were like five,
[50:31.040 --> 50:32.760]  and two of them you couldn't even register
[50:32.760 --> 50:35.440]  because like.edu was only for accredited schools
[50:35.440 --> 50:38.520]  and.mil was for the military.
[50:38.520 --> 50:43.000]  300 top level domain extensions at Hover.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.200]  So no matter what you want to build,
[50:44.200 --> 50:45.560]  there's a domain name waiting for it.
[50:45.560 --> 50:47.640]  You'll find excellent tech support,
[50:47.640 --> 50:49.880]  willing to answer any questions you might have.
[50:49.880 --> 50:51.920]  Their support team doesn't upsell you.
[50:51.920 --> 50:54.280]  They only work hard to help you get online.
[50:54.280 --> 50:58.040]  And so stuff like, who is privacy protection?
[50:58.040 --> 50:59.280]  You don't have to pay extra for that.
[50:59.280 --> 51:00.680]  That's all just included.
[51:00.680 --> 51:02.320]  They want you to have the good experience.
[51:02.320 --> 51:03.400]  They want it to be private.
[51:03.400 --> 51:05.280]  They don't upsell you on those things.
[51:05.280 --> 51:07.560]  And they just have a great user interface.
[51:07.560 --> 51:09.920]  It's really just a terrific way.
[51:09.920 --> 51:14.040]  So you type foo.com and that's not available,
[51:14.040 --> 51:17.080]  but their suggestions for what is available,
[51:17.080 --> 51:21.200]  maybe with the same root word on the left side of the dot,
[51:21.200 --> 51:23.280]  but a different top level domain
[51:23.280 --> 51:26.440]  or something else you can do to get that word
[51:26.440 --> 51:28.240]  and put some other word in front of it.
[51:28.240 --> 51:30.760]  It's just really, really intelligent, the suggestions.
[51:30.760 --> 51:32.440]  It's not like the sort of thing
[51:32.440 --> 51:34.400]  where they just put a random number
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.960]  after the word you want and expect that,
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.960]  foo2536758.com might be a fine domain name for you.
[51:42.960 --> 51:46.200]  Forget it, no, they have a great interface for this,
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.040]  great tech support.
[51:48.040 --> 51:50.880]  Here's where you go, hover.com, H-O-V-E-R,
[51:50.880 --> 51:53.520]  hover.com slash talk show.
[51:53.520 --> 51:56.520]  And use that domain, you get 10% with that referral link
[51:56.520 --> 51:58.440]  on all new purchases.
[51:58.440 --> 52:00.040]  They will even help you, their tech support.
[52:00.040 --> 52:02.040]  If you've got domains at a registrar
[52:02.040 --> 52:05.120]  who you're not happy with, Hover will help you.
[52:05.120 --> 52:07.280]  Hold your hand every step of the way
[52:07.280 --> 52:09.000]  to transfer them over to Hover.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.880]  You'll be so much happier for it.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.640]  Once again, hover.com slash talk show.
[52:15.200 --> 52:18.480]  So before we leave your wild camping trip and post,
[52:18.480 --> 52:21.400]  I wanna say the thing that caught my eye first
[52:21.400 --> 52:24.080]  when I read the blog post were there's two photographs
[52:24.080 --> 52:26.440]  that illustrate it of the Scottish Highlands,
[52:26.440 --> 52:29.280]  and they are absolutely gorgeous.
[52:29.280 --> 52:30.960]  Did you take them with the iPhone?
[52:30.960 --> 52:33.960]  Yeah, yeah, those are just with the 13 Pro
[52:33.960 --> 52:34.840]  that I have with me.
[52:34.840 --> 52:37.640]  The first one, both of them reminded me
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.640]  of there's an iconic scene in the James Bond movie Skyfall
[52:41.640 --> 52:45.320]  where Bond and M are driving through Scotland
[52:45.320 --> 52:48.720]  to his ancestral home, and he stops the car
[52:48.720 --> 52:52.680]  so he can pose, and it's moody and dark and glum
[52:52.680 --> 52:53.640]  and very Scotland-like.
[52:53.640 --> 52:56.640]  But your photos make Scotland look sunny and warm,
[52:56.640 --> 53:00.560]  even though it looks like it's a very similar area.
[53:00.560 --> 53:04.560]  Yeah, well, amusingly, so the first picture in the post
[53:04.560 --> 53:08.600]  is actually the backside of exactly the same valley
[53:08.600 --> 53:12.320]  that James Bond is in, in that scene in Skyfall
[53:12.320 --> 53:15.800]  that when I was doing my research for this particular trip,
[53:15.800 --> 53:17.160]  I kept seeing on Google Maps,
[53:17.160 --> 53:19.360]  there would be the point of interest marker.
[53:19.360 --> 53:22.400]  It would be like the James Bond Skyfall spot,
[53:22.400 --> 53:24.760]  and people would presumably be going to pose
[53:24.760 --> 53:28.400]  by their own cars, looking pensive like James Bond.
[53:28.400 --> 53:30.240]  So yeah, so it was exactly where I was,
[53:30.240 --> 53:34.840]  and I will say, though, those two pictures
[53:34.840 --> 53:36.720]  maybe give a slightly rosier impression
[53:36.720 --> 53:40.360]  of what Scotland is like in November than is the reality,
[53:40.360 --> 53:43.080]  that these are the moments when there was beautiful,
[53:43.080 --> 53:45.000]  gorgeous light breaking through the clouds.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.080]  And like that first picture, it's lovely, it looks sunny,
[53:48.080 --> 53:49.960]  and then a couple of hours later,
[53:49.960 --> 53:52.840]  I was forced to break camp and move down into the valley
[53:52.840 --> 53:56.600]  because I had howling winds and icy rain.
[53:56.600 --> 54:00.840]  So Scotland definitely does have that moodiness,
[54:00.840 --> 54:02.160]  but if you give it a chance,
[54:02.160 --> 54:05.040]  it can have some gorgeous moments too.
[54:05.040 --> 54:07.320]  It has its moments, as you're trying to say.
[54:08.600 --> 54:09.440]  Absolutely beautiful.
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.280]  I was just watching Skyfall last week, actually,
[54:12.280 --> 54:14.480]  after I posted a blog post
[54:14.480 --> 54:16.600]  about the cinematography of Skyfall and Spectre,
[54:16.600 --> 54:19.040]  and of course it made me want to watch them again.
[54:19.960 --> 54:22.160]  And it's funny, when you have movies
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.160]  that you've watched a million times over the years,
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.720]  could be like Back to the Future or Raiders of the Lost Ark
[54:28.720 --> 54:29.880]  or any of your favorites.
[54:29.880 --> 54:32.400]  And for me, of course, everybody knows I'm a big Bond fan,
[54:32.400 --> 54:34.600]  so I've watched all of them many times,
[54:34.600 --> 54:35.740]  including the newish ones.
[54:35.740 --> 54:38.900]  But it's funny, the more familiar you are,
[54:38.900 --> 54:41.600]  you start to have funny thoughts and notice weird things
[54:41.600 --> 54:43.440]  that just didn't strike you
[54:43.440 --> 54:45.040]  like the first or second time you watched it.
[54:45.040 --> 54:47.500]  And that scene where Bond, again,
[54:47.500 --> 54:49.520]  pensive is the exact right adjective,
[54:49.520 --> 54:53.280]  stops the car, gets out, and it just looks pensive and moody
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.280]  while Scotland looks pensive and moody
[54:56.280 --> 54:58.940]  and foreboding and gloomy.
[54:58.940 --> 55:01.280]  It occurred to me, why did he stop the car and get out?
[55:01.280 --> 55:02.480]  Yeah.
[55:02.480 --> 55:03.680]  Except...
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.800]  What's he doing?
[55:04.800 --> 55:06.160]  Except to pose.
[55:07.240 --> 55:09.080]  Yeah, no, he was just taking out his iPhone
[55:09.080 --> 55:10.360]  to take a quick snap,
[55:10.360 --> 55:11.400]  because it was just, you know,
[55:11.400 --> 55:14.160]  the light happened to look good at that moment.
[55:14.160 --> 55:16.440]  Right, imagine how different that scene would play
[55:16.440 --> 55:17.960]  if Bond got out of the car
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.560]  and took his phone out to take a picture.
[55:21.560 --> 55:25.040]  Yeah, instead of being all moody and foreboding
[55:25.040 --> 55:27.640]  and setting this tone, it would just be goofy.
[55:27.640 --> 55:29.120]  And then the other idea that I had
[55:29.120 --> 55:31.800]  that made me laugh to myself
[55:31.800 --> 55:33.640]  as I watched the movie by myself
[55:33.640 --> 55:35.760]  was how funny it would be if the scene started
[55:35.760 --> 55:37.240]  with Bond pulling up a zipper
[55:37.240 --> 55:39.840]  because he had to get out to take a leak.
[55:39.840 --> 55:41.600]  That seems like something Roger Moore would do,
[55:41.600 --> 55:44.680]  like the side of Daniel Craig, Bond,
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.760]  but yeah, I could totally see the comedy moment of that.
[55:48.880 --> 55:51.040]  It would not be a very Bondian moment,
[55:51.040 --> 55:51.920]  but it would have been.
[55:51.920 --> 55:53.880]  It made me laugh imagining it,
[55:53.880 --> 55:55.240]  because then it would at least explain
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.600]  why he stopped the car.
[55:56.600 --> 55:57.440]  Yeah.
[55:59.680 --> 56:01.240]  Anyway, good job with the photos.
[56:01.240 --> 56:03.080]  The Scotland Board of Tourism,
[56:03.080 --> 56:05.680]  I'm sure, has a check in the mail to you.
[56:05.680 --> 56:06.520]  Sure, yeah, I know.
[56:06.520 --> 56:11.520]  It's a place worth surviving the bad weather, too,
[56:12.040 --> 56:14.080]  to get the gorgeous moments, for sure.
[56:15.360 --> 56:17.680]  There are worse things to do, sensibly.
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.480]  I mean, I didn't do this for my work,
[56:19.480 --> 56:21.080]  but vaguely for my work,
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.720]  going and hiking around in the Scottish mountains
[56:23.720 --> 56:26.600]  to test out Apple Watch battery life performance.
[56:26.600 --> 56:29.040]  There are worse things to spend a week doing.
[56:30.520 --> 56:31.960]  Let me just take another break here
[56:31.960 --> 56:33.600]  and thank our third and final sponsor,
[56:33.600 --> 56:36.240]  and then we can head down the homestretch of the show,
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.320]  and it's our good friends at Memberful.
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.040]  Memberful allows you, a creative person with an audience,
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.880]  to monetize your audience with memberships.
[56:46.880 --> 56:49.840]  Memberful allows you to build a sustainable, recurring
[56:49.840 --> 56:52.440]  revenue, and it is the easiest way
[56:52.440 --> 56:54.240]  to sell memberships to your audience,
[56:54.240 --> 56:56.880]  and it is used by some of the biggest creators on the web,
[56:56.880 --> 56:59.120]  and they have everything you need
[56:59.120 --> 57:00.600]  to run a membership program,
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.520]  including custom branding, gift subscriptions,
[57:03.520 --> 57:06.880]  Apple Pay support, free trials, and tons more.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.480]  Maybe you do a podcast and you wanna have
[57:08.480 --> 57:11.080]  a special episodes just for members,
[57:11.080 --> 57:12.560]  or maybe you do something else
[57:12.560 --> 57:15.040]  but wanna have a members-only podcast,
[57:15.040 --> 57:16.120]  and you think, well, that would be something
[57:16.120 --> 57:17.960]  people would pay for, but then you start thinking,
[57:17.960 --> 57:19.800]  how do I do that, how do I even set that up
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.520]  so that only the members get access to the podcast?
[57:23.520 --> 57:26.480]  Guess what, Memberful has it, it's a built-in feature,
[57:26.480 --> 57:27.760]  so you don't have to worry about
[57:27.760 --> 57:30.480]  how to make it work technically, just use Memberful.
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.120]  They have a world-class support team
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.040]  ready to help you simplify your memberships
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.280]  and grow your revenue.
[57:35.280 --> 57:39.320]  They are on your side, because Memberful only makes money
[57:39.320 --> 57:42.280]  when you, a Memberful creator,
[57:42.280 --> 57:45.280]  get people to sign up for your memberships.
[57:45.280 --> 57:46.880]  People sign up for your memberships,
[57:46.880 --> 57:50.160]  you get recurring revenue and Memberful wins
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.040]  by taking their tiny little slice of the money.
[57:54.040 --> 57:57.960]  You can get started for free with no credit card required,
[57:57.960 --> 57:59.680]  kick the tires, try it out,
[57:59.680 --> 58:01.480]  see everything they have to offer.
[58:01.480 --> 58:02.920]  It's just a terrific service.
[58:02.920 --> 58:04.360]  I use it, you probably use it,
[58:04.360 --> 58:05.960]  anybody listening to this show,
[58:05.960 --> 58:07.080]  whether you know it or not,
[58:07.080 --> 58:09.360]  because they don't put their brand in front of your brand,
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.320]  like Six Colors, Jason Snell's site uses Memberful.
[58:12.320 --> 58:13.200]  You may not even know it,
[58:13.200 --> 58:15.880]  you might be a subscriber to Six Colors
[58:15.880 --> 58:20.720]  or many of the fine podcasts with our friends at Relay.fm.
[58:20.720 --> 58:22.760]  They use Memberful, you may not know it.
[58:22.760 --> 58:25.640]  You just feel like you're signing up for Relay.fm
[58:25.640 --> 58:27.800]  and they stay behind the scenes.
[58:27.800 --> 58:29.080]  It's just a great service.
[58:29.080 --> 58:30.880]  You're probably already subscribed to some.
[58:30.880 --> 58:32.680]  If you have an audience you'd like to monetize,
[58:32.680 --> 58:34.960]  check them out, I recommend it.
[58:34.960 --> 58:38.200]  I'm a happy subscriber to many, many Memberful sites.
[58:38.200 --> 58:43.200]  Go to memberful, M-E-M-B-E-R, memberful, F-U-L,.com,
[58:43.320 --> 58:45.160]  slash talk show today,
[58:45.160 --> 58:46.320]  and they'll know you came from the show.
[58:46.320 --> 58:51.320]  Once again, that's memberful.com slash talk show.
[58:53.240 --> 58:56.240]  Is it safe to say is WidgetSmith is your top app?
[58:57.320 --> 58:59.680]  I think it is my top app,
[58:59.680 --> 59:04.680]  perhaps by a factor of 100 or something along those factors.
[59:05.320 --> 59:07.920]  It is probably the most successful thing
[59:07.920 --> 59:10.280]  I will probably ever make in my entire career.
[59:10.280 --> 59:13.680]  You were on the show last September,
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.160]  and at the time iOS 14 had just shipped
[59:18.160 --> 59:22.640]  and WidgetSmith blew up,
[59:22.640 --> 59:25.960]  because this is what we now call widgets,
[59:25.960 --> 59:28.080]  and there have been all sorts of things over this,
[59:28.080 --> 59:32.520]  but today's Apple world definition of a widget
[59:32.520 --> 59:34.680]  debuted last year with iOS 14.
[59:34.680 --> 59:35.800]  You came on the show.
[59:35.800 --> 59:36.960]  It was a dizzying time.
[59:36.960 --> 59:38.400]  I almost feel bad in hindsight.
[59:38.400 --> 59:41.000]  I feel like maybe you still had,
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.400]  you had emergency bug fixes to squeeze out.
[59:43.400 --> 59:44.840]  Maybe you shouldn't have come on the show,
[59:44.840 --> 59:47.400]  and you certainly didn't need the publicity at the moment.
[59:47.400 --> 59:48.240]  No.
[59:50.320 --> 59:51.840]  One year later, what are your thoughts
[59:51.840 --> 59:55.400]  on the state of widgets in Apple's ecosystem
[59:55.400 --> 59:59.760]  and where WidgetSmith is thriving?
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.200]  Yeah, so it's interesting.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.440]  So thinking back to a year ago
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.080]  when widgets were at its highest 14,
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.360]  and I think in a way that surprised everybody probably,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.240]  really took off and really was a marquee feature
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:20.240]  that got the attention, not just of the techy people
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.360]  or the Apple fanboys or whatever.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.520]  It was just across the board.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.080]  Everybody was excited about widgets,
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.960]  and they took off, and they took off in ways
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.840]  that I don't think, and I certainly didn't expect,
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.080]  but the way WidgetSmith has developed
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.640]  and what it has been coming to use for
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.880]  is just wildly different than what I ever would have thought.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.160]  I was making something that I thought
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.560]  was this very power usury, very finicky kind of tool
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.000]  that lets you display all kinds of fancy weather graphs
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.240]  and astronomical projections and things,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.840]  and it's like, in fact, what most people really cared about
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.400]  is putting photos of people who are meaningful to them
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.440]  or things that are meaningful to them on their home screens.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.680]  And by a huge margin,
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.480]  the number one widget type in WidgetSmith
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.120]  is just the single one-photo widget
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.040]  that people would just want to choose a picture,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.960]  it's a favorite photo for whatever reason,
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.240]  and they want to put it on their home screen,
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.440]  and they want to look at it regularly.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.480]  And I don't think I ever would have predicted
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.720]  that I would have ended up being
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.640]  a digital picture frame maker, and that's my career,
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.600]  and that is what the vast majority of my revenue
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.040]  and my business is coming from is from helping people
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.840]  show digital pictures on their home screen.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:42.240]  And I'm kind of in awe that it's still going,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.200]  that a year on, it's still doing really well,
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.960]  lots of people are still finding it.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.600]  And I think the feature,
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.160]  and I think what it has taught me about it
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.600]  is it's like widgets, and specifically photo widgets
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.120]  and that kind of thing is fascinating
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.280]  for how it lends itself to word-of-mouth marketing
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.360]  and experiencing growth in that way,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.080]  because it's a very straightforward,
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.120]  easy-to-communicate thing that if someone sees on my phone
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.880]  that I have a picture of my daughter,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.160]  and they're like, huh, I want to do that,
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.200]  I didn't know you could do that,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.700]  and even a year on, I still constantly am hearing
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.040]  from people who are like, I didn't know
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.560]  I could do widgets on my home screen,
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.520]  that you would think in some ways, oh wow,
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.760]  everyone knows, but it's like, no,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.700]  there's billions of, there's a billion active iPhones
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:32.480]  in the world, and yeah, there are not a billion people
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.440]  who probably know about widgets,
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.360]  and so it's this fascinating kind of experience
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.280]  where people continue to care about it,
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.960]  and it's just, it's so obvious and straightforward
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.440]  that people want it, that you want to be able to show
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.040]  people, you know, you want to put on your phone
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.800]  things that mean something to you,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.160]  that your home screen, you know,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.660]  it's like people like putting the wallpaper pictures
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.240]  on the lock screen of, you know, pictures that they do,
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.880]  or just pictures in general, are always so meaningful,
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.560]  and that's turned out to be what, you know,
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.760]  it's like WidgetSmith is about, or widgets in general,
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.980]  and I wouldn't have predicted that,
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:07.280]  I don't think Apple would have predicted that,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.640]  I mean, it's, but it's been, you know,
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.040]  quite a ride as a result.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.500]  It resonates, I wrote about this recently,
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.660]  I think when I was writing, doing my review
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.960]  of the Series 7, I know people who work at,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.060]  on WatchOS at Apple, and sometimes when friends leave
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.520]  and go to other parts of Apple,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.040]  they're a little bit more willing,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.840]  a few years down the road, to tell war stories,
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.760]  but like famously, Apple, WatchOS does not support
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.680]  custom watch faces, so like a third-party developer
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.140]  doesn't get to design the whole face,
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:39.120]  you get, you can design complications
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.740]  that go in Apple's faces, and it almost seems like
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.240]  we're enough years into this where people
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.760]  have stopped complaining about it,
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.120]  or at least I don't see it anymore,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.600]  even though it used to be a major complaint,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.480]  because I think people have gotten accustomed to the idea,
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.800]  okay, yeah, they're gonna design all the watch faces,
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.960]  and part of that is about battery life, of course,
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.680]  from the early years, but I think a bigger part
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.000]  is battery life aside, that they don't wanna trust
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.600]  third-party developers to have this always-running
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.960]  thing on the watch, is the branding,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.200]  that it's just, it really, it's a way that Apple,
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.040]  as different as an Apple Watch is from a traditional watch,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.140]  even pre-Apple Watch digital watches,
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.840]  but certainly from, you know, like mechanical watches,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.320]  or just regular analog quartz watches,
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.080]  but one way that Apple sees the Apple Watch
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.600]  very similar to traditional watchmakers,
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.920]  especially the premium brands, is that they consider
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.520]  the watch face part of the Apple Watch brand,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.420]  and in the same way that you could tell,
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.600]  I can tell a Rolex is a Rolex before I get close enough
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.820]  to read the word Rolex, all of their watches,
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.080]  they have very, you know, some of them have lots of diamonds
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:45.080]  and mother of pearls surface on the dial,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.600]  some of them are just plain black and silver,
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.360]  but they all look Rolex-y.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.400]  Omegas all look like Omega watches,
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.940]  and Omega has sort of a broader brand,
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.280]  and it ranges more from sporty to dressy,
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.440]  but still, I can tell there's just an aesthetic, you know?
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.920]  It's James Bond movies look like James Bond movies
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.840]  and sound like them, and Omega watches look like Omega,
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:15.520]  and all Apple Watch faces look like Apple Watch faces.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.080]  The exception to that, right from the get-go,
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.520]  with the original, was the photos watch face,
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.080]  because you can put anything there,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.800]  and it also defeated the idea that, like we mentioned,
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.840]  I think earlier in the show, where the,
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.680]  with series three and series two in the original,
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.320]  with those sharp corners on the rectangular screen,
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.960]  by using black backgrounds on all the other watch faces,
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.600]  and the way that OLED blacks are true inky blacks,
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.680]  you couldn't see the corners of the display
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.360]  where it turned into the bezel,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.560]  and it created this very nice illusion
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.880]  that the whole front face of the Apple Watch
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.720]  was the display, even though it very much wasn't,
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.560]  but then you'd use the photo watch face
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.200]  and put a photo of your kid or your dog on,
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.040]  and all of a sudden, it was just a perfect rectangle,
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.600]  and you could see just how chunky
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.640]  the bezels were surrounding it,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.600]  and it didn't have any Apple branding,
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.120]  and maybe it's not even a very flattering picture
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.560]  of your dog.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.880]  Yeah, but why did they ship it?
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.080]  Because they knew how many people
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.680]  would set their desktop picture on their Mac
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.440]  or their wallpaper on their phone
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.840]  to pictures of their pets or their kids
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.440]  or their parents or their loved ones
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.360]  or a family vacation or something like that,
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.880]  and that's what so many people love to do,
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.000]  and they just knew that Johnny Ive's perceived,
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.320]  you know, I don't know for a fact that it was Johnny Ive,
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.520]  but let's just say Johnny Ive really wasn't
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.080]  all that happy about the photo's face
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.680]  because he kind of wanted every Apple watch face
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.920]  to be Apple design team approved.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.480]  Well, photos is the exception
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.040]  because people love putting photos on devices,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.120]  but the funny thing about doing it
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.280]  like on the iPhone with the wallpaper, everybody,
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.440]  I mean, number one, I'm sure thousands of people
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.680]  listening to this show actually have pictures
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.160]  of their kids or their wives or their husbands
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.160]  on their wallpaper or on their phone,
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.240]  but everybody else knows somebody who does, right?
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.840]  You cannot go to Thanksgiving this year
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.360]  and look at everybody's phones and not find
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.760]  that probably at least half of them
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.960]  have like family members of their wallpaper,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.180]  but the funny thing about doing that
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.720]  is that they're behind your icons,
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.720]  so you put like, you get like this great picture
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.020]  of your daughter and you put her on your phone,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:31.860]  and then what do you do?
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.880]  You cover it up with icons.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.120]  It's sort of, in a way, it's like sort of insulting,
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.000]  so the picture frame as a widget is like the opposite.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.840]  It's the inverse.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.160]  It's a way of making that picture prominent,
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.640]  and it's above the wallpaper.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.920]  Yeah, and it's clearly, it resonates.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.760]  It is scratching an itch that people clearly had,
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.440]  that they wanna elevate it from the back of their icons
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.520]  to be a peer of their icons,
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.920]  and they can show it and they can see it,
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.560]  and I think what's interesting is
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.760]  Apple always does a great job in their own photos widget.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.800]  They're doing these crazy machine learning models
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.640]  to identify the photos that they think would look good
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.440]  and would make you happy and are doing some really
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.200]  clever things there, and I thought,
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.640]  when iOS 14 launched, they only had one photo widget,
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.780]  and it was their, sort of essentially their memories widget
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:24.580]  that's doing this kind of clever surfacing of photos
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.820]  from your entire photo library,
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.920]  and I expected what they would do is, at some point,
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.960]  you see like, in iOS 15, there was gonna be
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.140]  more photo widgets that they would have, say,
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:35.720]  the ability to, in the Photos app,
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.480]  where right now, if you hit share,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.320]  one of the options is set as wallpaper.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.960]  I expected, at some point, to be like,
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.080]  set as widget, and it didn't happen,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.840]  and I'm certainly not sad about that.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:49.600]  I'm certainly, I'm very glad that that has not happened yet,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.460]  and maybe in iOS 16, it'll come,
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.920]  and it'll Sherlock me a bit,
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.600]  but the reality is, and the more I thought about it,
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.680]  the more I can slightly see where
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.680]  apps like Widgetsmith let Apple do things
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.600]  in their Apple-y way without the need to add that feature,
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.720]  because their widgets are always gonna show
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.760]  beautiful pictures that, it's like,
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.040]  it's a bit of a joke that during the keynotes and things,
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.000]  like the pictures and all their screenshots
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.480]  are just these amazing families
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.440]  having these gorgeous trips to amazing places,
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.240]  and it's always, everyone's happy and everything's perfect.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.080]  And-
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.920]  And perfectly lit.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.840]  Yeah, perfectly lit.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.060]  Everything's exactly how you would expect,
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.320]  and the reality is, in my experience of a year of using,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.880]  I use my own widgets, but I also use Apple's Photos widget
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:40.320]  because it is exceptionally good
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.500]  at picking out really beautiful pictures from my library
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.680]  and surfacing things in a way that
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.320]  I don't think I would feel like,
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.960]  I'm not sure I'd want to go digging around
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.400]  in people's photos enough to do that kind of analysis,
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.820]  even if I thought I could do it,
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.280]  but I'd never be able to do it as well as Apple can,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.600]  but it means that they're leaving up the opportunity
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.000]  for, for me, for if someone wants a picture
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.360]  that isn't that perfect, perfectly lit,
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.280]  gorgeous, amazing photo that's the exact one
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.960]  where everyone is smiling and everything,
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.760]  like, there could be other reasons why a photo is important,
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.260]  that maybe it's slightly out of focus
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.240]  and slightly off lighting, and it's not the best,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.840]  but it's a moment that really means something to you,
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.960]  and there's no way for the ML model to say,
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.520]  oh, this is a meaningful moment.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.420]  They can just say, oh, it's slightly out of focus
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:30.600]  and kind of dark, but, you know, in WidgetSmith,
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.360]  they can grab that picture and they can elevate it,
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.840]  but in Apple's one, they can continue to show
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.780]  that all of their widgets are gonna show beautiful pictures,
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:39.440]  and it's amazing, and I love it,
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.580]  and I think it's reminded me of moments
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.320]  and pulled things out of my library
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.420]  that I had not necessarily forgotten,
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:50.080]  but I was delighted to be reminded of.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.040]  They're two different things,
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.120]  and I kind of like that both of them are possible,
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.680]  and they let you sort of customize your phone
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.480]  in a different way, that one of them,
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.880]  you're choosing something that's meaningful to you
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.480]  for reasons that are personal,
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.560]  and, you know, Apple's widget is choosing photos
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.160]  that are probably meaningful to you in a different way
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.760]  for a different set of metrics.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.880]  I am constantly amazed by the Memories widget
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.520]  and how good its pics are.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.400]  Like, the batting average for ones
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.640]  that I consider good photos is astonishing,
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.160]  and it also surprises me as a longtime user
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.080]  of Apple's photos, so I've, you know,
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.260]  my son is 17, he's a senior in high school,
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:30.000]  and so I've got photos of him 17 years,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.640]  and I've been favoriting ones all of his life,
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.160]  but they're not just picking ones
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.160]  that I have tapped the heart button for over the years,
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.760]  and it constantly surprises me where I'll see one
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.320]  and think, oh, my God, this is so cute,
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.520]  I gotta send it to my wife, and I send him to him, too,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.640]  I send him to our group chat,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.300]  and he's a good sport about it,
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.000]  and every once in a while, he, you know,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.360]  he actually seems to enjoy it.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.160]  I'll see, like, one of his favorite toys
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.380]  from toddlerhood and remember it and talk about it,
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.040]  but I'll go back, I'll tap through the widget and go
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.000]  and expect that it already has the heart.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.600]  I'm like, well, of course I favorited that one,
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.520]  and it surprises me how often I didn't,
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.760]  because at the time, I just thought,
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.120]  well, I won't delete that one, that's a keeper,
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.320]  but that was all I thought of it,
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.600]  and now 15, 16, 14 years later,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.760]  it's, like, making my heart melt.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.500]  Yeah, and there's no, and there's,
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.080]  it's amazing that that's something that their model can do
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.840]  because it's not relying on you to favorite something
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.640]  is gonna be dependent on your mood
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.320]  and what you're thinking about, your time and things,
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.960]  whereas their model can just,
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.060]  for whatever dark witchcraft they've come up with
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.160]  to do this, they've worked out how to define
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.720]  what a good picture is, and they can find them,
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.240]  and then they can show them to you.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.600]  I very rarely have seen a, you know,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.200]  had a picture just get surfaced there that I'm like,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.060]  why is that one there?
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.960]  Like, that's weird, you know, but, and it's great,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.240]  and I think it's this fascinating tension that lets them,
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.680]  you know, it's like, it's something that is special
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.280]  to their widgets that I don't think, you know,
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.480]  having spent a year working on photo widgets
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.800]  and that being, like, a meaningful amount of my life,
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.640]  I don't think anybody could make a photo widget
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.880]  as good as Apple's photo widget, and that's fine.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.600]  The funny thing is, though, if you,
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.700]  if you just, like, take them as a spec,
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.040]  like, let's make a product spec
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.840]  for the Apple Memories photo widget,
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.600]  and let's make a spec for Widgetsmith's
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.800]  just-pick-a-picture-and-pick-a-frame photo widget.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.120]  The description, and again, I'm not saying, you know,
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.100]  like, part of what makes Widgetsmith so popular
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.580]  is that you take a simple idea
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.480]  and make an exquisitely good customizable UI around it.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.240]  So I'm not saying that what you did was easy,
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.760]  but it's very easy to describe, right?
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.240]  You pick a favorite photo, pick a size, pick a frame,
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.120]  and now you have a widget of that,
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.320]  a permanent frame of that photo are on your home screen.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.800]  The Apple feature is like, okay,
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.560]  figure out a machine-learning model
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.020]  to find very pleasing photos.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.140]  Do it in a completely private way,
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.320]  because if it weren't private, it would be a disaster
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.640]  and a publicity disaster and just a bad idea overall.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.540]  Do it privately, do it in a way that doesn't, like,
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:20.160]  burn the phone's battery down, analyzing all these photos.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.760]  Create custom silicon to run machine learning
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.800]  very efficiently and in parallel.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.780]  It's like this massive billion dollar,
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.820]  it's literally banked on, like, billions of dollars
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:39.440]  in research and development into machine learning.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.680]  And sometimes what people want
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.080]  is the simplest thing possible.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.640]  No, I just love this one picture of my dog,
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.800]  and I'd really like to see it
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.560]  on my second home screen every day.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.060]  So there's a certain beauty to that,
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.880]  that both of those things are valuable
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.680]  and are both impacting people in positive ways.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.480]  Apple's thing, like you said, it's billions of dollars
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.200]  in terms of the infrastructure behind it, and mine is not.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.020]  But they're both impactful, and they're both things
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:11.120]  that make people's phones mean more to them.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.840]  The thing that I love hearing in feedback
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.920]  and just picking up from customers
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.800]  with Widgetsmith is how enduring,
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.280]  in a way that is something that most of the software
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.360]  that I've written, it's people like using it, it's nice,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.520]  it can be enjoyable, easy to use,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.100]  well-designed, pretty, et cetera,
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.100]  but it doesn't have that same sense of emotional connection
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.040]  that people being able to be reminded of someone
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.760]  that they care about throughout the day,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.440]  every time they pick up their phone, it's right there,
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.640]  is just a different kind of thing.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.800]  And it's amazing how, yeah, from things so simple
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.680]  as just pick a picture and put it in a widget
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.080]  to this deep, complicated model, they can both exist,
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.980]  and they can both be beautiful in their own way.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.480]  I joke, but I'm a dedicated user
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.040]  of your sleep++ sleep tracker for Apple Watch,
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.080]  which I know you know, Merlin Mann turned me on to,
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.920]  I think two years ago, I think I've been doing this
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.600]  for two years, and it's like, I don't have sleep problems.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.840]  I sleep like a rock 99 days out of 100,
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.920]  and I've purposely created a life where I just,
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.360]  I don't have to wake up at a certain time.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.200]  I just sleep till I wake up, and then I'm ready to go,
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.640]  but I can't stop looking at it.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.560]  I just love the reports, and I love to see like, huh,
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.240]  if you sleep 10 hours two nights in a row, you really do.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.480]  You just wake up after eight hours the third day
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.920]  because you're like fully rested, like full tank.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.800]  I will tell you this, though, I love the app sleep++.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.660]  It's a great sleep tracker, very simple, really like it,
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.280]  does not give me any emotional, the feels, right?
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.640]  Like it does not warm my heart,
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.960]  doesn't bring tears to my eyes.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.860]  I don't think, oh, I should take a screenshot of this one
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.200]  and send that one to the family.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.040]  No.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:51.960]  Yeah.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:52.800]  No.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.640]  No, it's a different kind of thing,
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.900]  and like they both have their place in our life,
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.720]  but I think a year on, I feel very fortunate
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.640]  to have sort of stumbled my way into something
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.360]  that hits that resonance with people and is really cool
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.840]  and is be able to, yeah, like enhance people.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.880]  It's a different kind of like,
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.460]  I guess Apple always likes to talk about
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.600]  the intersection of technology and the liberal arts, right?
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.360]  It's that kind of, where these things stop being
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.680]  just about algorithms or about visual design or graphics
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.700]  and it can become something that's more human
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.160]  and more humane, like it's kind of cool.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.720]  And I don't think that's, when widgets were announced
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.280]  at, you know, WWDC 2020, that was,
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.760]  I don't think what anyone had in mind.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.600]  No.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.440]  That's the kind of connection
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.060]  that people would be having with their computers
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.960]  and they'd be reminded of these wonderful things
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.800]  in their life.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.720]  Apple knows, I mean, and they'll tell you.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.760]  I mean, it's, you know, there's however many,
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.880]  hundreds of thousands of apps in the app store,
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.680]  maybe there's a million apps, I don't know what it is,
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.360]  but you know, hundreds of thousands of apps,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.560]  all over, you know, all sorts of ideas,
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.520]  almost all of them things Apple never would have built itself
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.280]  or wouldn't want to build itself.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.680]  They know people come up with ideas that they don't have
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.840]  and that you're not gonna, shouldn't be part of the stock
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.440]  iPhone or iPad or even Mac experience.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.000]  But I sort of feel they still present features
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.080]  in an Apple-like way.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.360]  And the Apple-like way is, does it make sense
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.240]  to have a widget for this app?
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.720]  Like notes app?
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.400]  Oh, sure, you know, you could show like, you know,
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.120]  your three most recent notes and then tap one
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.720]  to jump right into it.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.640]  Does it have photos?
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.160]  Oh, of course there should be a photos.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.960]  But then they're like, we could do,
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.120]  we could do like a clever machine learning thing.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.800]  But then that's it, that's the photos widget.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.160]  And so like that sort of simplified mindset is like,
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.480]  if it makes sense for an app to have a widget,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.560]  in Apple's mind, it's like, think of one good widget, right?
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.400]  I wonder how much they thought in advance.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.520]  Surely it occurred to them that something like WidgetSmith
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.820]  would be possible, you know, a widget construction kit.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.080]  But it also, it's like I often say like,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:04.040]  the path to success as an indie app in the Apple,
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.880]  anybody could get Sherlock on a feature or something
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.800]  like you even said, like, if it's possible,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.100]  iOS 16 could add a, the same way that you can set a picture
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.760]  as your wallpaper, you could set it as a widget.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.680]  You can get Sherlocked, but like the, on a feature,
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.360]  but like the best way to approach it is to think like,
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.400]  what can I do that would be appealing to enough people
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.700]  that they would pay for it,
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.140]  but also isn't something Apple would do, right?
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.000]  Fantastical is a great example,
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  where Fantastical is a great calendar app,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.400]  and it does some things and has some levels of customization
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.960]  that just would not make sense for Apple
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.240]  to add to the built-in calendar app, right?
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.820]  It's tough, you know, and there's a bunch of popular,
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.720]  very popular third-party email clients.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.320]  The operating system ships with a very good email client,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.280]  but it's, you know, email's a funny thing
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.460]  and people like to do it funny ways,
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.800]  and you can make a lot of people happy with an email app
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:02.180]  that doesn't work like Apple Mail at all, right?
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.940]  Yeah, and I think it's, oh, I run into this sometimes
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.140]  when I start to think about the scale
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:11.360]  that Apple's solution has to work at,
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.800]  that it's easy sometimes for me as a developer
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.320]  to think about the size of my user base,
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.480]  and I mean, before WidgetSmith, especially,
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.160]  but it's like my user bases were mentioned,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.320]  you know, measured in, you know,
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.360]  it's like tens of thousands of people is a successful app,
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.020]  and to remember that Apple is solving their problems,
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.000]  and coming up with the solutions for their thing
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.040]  that need to sort of scale to a billion users,
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.860]  and it's just a different mentality,
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.620]  where I'm like, well, why don't they just add an option?
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.740]  Why don't they just do a thing?
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.400]  It's like, well, that has to make sense
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.360]  for everybody who has an iPhone,
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.000]  and the scale of that is a totally different kind of,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.320]  you know, sort of problem than solution that if they,
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.880]  you know, you and I could be like on the,
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.040]  always on watch face, it's like, why isn't there an option
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.560]  so that the utility face doesn't shrink and grow?
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.960]  It's like, we can say, why isn't there an option?
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.040]  It's like, well, if there is an option,
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.240]  then every single Apple Watch is gonna have that option,
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.480]  and it needs to work in every circumstance for everyone,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480]  and it needs to be communicated,
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.240]  and it's like the scale and complexity of that
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.940]  is so different, and so I think there is
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:14.840]  a tremendous opportunity in filling in those gaps.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.160]  It isn't that Apple couldn't,
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.880]  it is that Apple is actively and consciously
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.720]  and intelligently choosing not to fill that gap.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.120]  And it's the sort of thing, too,
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.560]  where it's like, if they made it an option,
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.540]  most people, I'm sure, haven't noticed that that happens.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.440]  There's probably thousands of people listening to this show
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.240]  who are like, what, that scales?
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.740]  And now they're like listening to the show,
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.520]  and they're looking at their Apple Watch or setting,
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.880]  like, I don't even use utility,
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.400]  and they quick set up a utility,
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.920]  and now they're like, huh, how about that?
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.600]  It does do that, right?
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.000]  But if they made it an option,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.440]  and people didn't even know what it did,
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.520]  they'd be like, I don't understand.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.520]  I'll keep flipping the switch.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.560]  I don't see any difference.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.520]  Apple, with its institutional resistance
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.120]  to making options, right?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.900]  Like, they're just generally resistant
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:57.080]  to making things an option.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:57.920]  We'll design it.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.520]  Designing is making decisions.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.720]  We'll do it for you.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.620]  Even with that mindset,
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.120]  look at how big the settings app is, right?
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.360]  That's what you get.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.320]  The settings app in iOS 15,
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.280]  or system preferences on the Mac,
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.080]  that's what you get when you have a company culture
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.040]  that's resistant to making settings.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.720]  Like, imagine if they were listening
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.000]  to idiot podcasters like me
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.480]  and make a setting for every one of my pet peeves.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.720]  It would be a nightmare.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.080]  The settings app would be as thick as a phone book.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.140]  Yeah, and it wouldn't be better,
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:31.840]  and it would lose what make sample products great.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.800]  It's like they're amazing for the general case,
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.520]  and that's what makes them great.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.440]  I know, we talked about this last year when you were on too,
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.440]  but I just love the way that it's still a thing
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.680]  where people are using custom widgets,
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:46.980]  like from WidgetSmith,
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.440]  and the trick with shortcuts
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.000]  where you can make a simple shortcut that just opens an app,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.160]  and then you can assign that app a custom icon,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.160]  and so you could rebrand all your 10 favorite apps
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.560]  with, and there's these icon packs you can download
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.960]  and put them in your photo library
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.480]  and then pick them to be the icons,
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.460]  and then you can get a themed black and white icon set.
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.500]  My son has done this.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.020]  Without me prompting him, it's not like,
[01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:19.520]  oh, go do this, I would like to talk about it
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520]  or write about it.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.680]  He did it on his own where he figured out,
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.160]  his phone was a mess.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.640]  Most people's, all the apps he had downloaded
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.500]  over the years were just spewed across home screens
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.060]  in no particular order,
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:34.320]  figured out the app library, loved it,
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.080]  put all of his apps in the app library,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.760]  and then has one home screen with his favorite apps,
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.680]  but they all have custom icons now,
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.740]  and I love that he did that
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:45.200]  because that's the sort of crap I used to do with my Mac
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.360]  when I was his age.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.400]  When I found out you could paste a custom icon
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.720]  on top of an app, it was like, this is amazing.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.940]  I can customize all of these icons that I don't like.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.680]  Yeah.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.160]  And I think it's lovely, too,
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.360]  insofar as it makes anyone a designer,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.340]  and it makes anybody, like,
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.260]  you don't need to be a designer with Photoshop
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.960]  and Illustrator and do all this kind of stuff,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.120]  that you can be designing something
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.400]  and coming up with an aesthetic or a look
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.800]  or be making choices in a way that is very much your own
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.200]  and is very much creative and artistic,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.800]  but isn't something that needs to be super heavy-handed,
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.100]  that it could just be choosing an icon pack
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.800]  and then, unfortunately, it's like sitting down
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.920]  for a couple of hours and messing around with shortcuts
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.660]  because they don't make it easy, but they make it possible,
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.840]  and it's like, it's a choice you made
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.920]  and it makes your phone your phone.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.580]  Like, in WidgetSmith, I always think it's amazing
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.520]  when you think about, you know,
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.000]  I let you choose between, I think it's about 12 fonts,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.140]  and even without getting into, like,
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.520]  the crazy custom colors,
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.640]  you could, like, there's like 36 built-in colors,
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.920]  and it's like, you can choose the foreground color,
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.740]  the background color, and the border color,
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.380]  and you multiply all those numbers together,
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.000]  and the reality is there is probably someone
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.400]  who has chosen almost every combination of those things,
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.200]  and it makes, they've made a choice
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.840]  that's artistic and creative
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.800]  and in some ways kind of unique to them,
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.920]  and that's, like, there's a certain,
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.040]  just kind of fun about that,
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.720]  and a whimsy to being able to design something
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.620]  on a device that you use all the time.
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:14.940]  Wow, that's well said.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.460]  And it just, I really do think it fosters that mentality,
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.340]  and for some people, that's the most they're gonna do,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.700]  it's the closest they're gonna get to being a UI designer,
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:25.300]  but for others, it's like their gateway
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:28.140]  to becoming a UI designer or a developer.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.900]  It's like, just look at the outside of people's phones.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.780]  Like, you could walk through the airport
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.620]  and try to observe every single phone
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.460]  you see people pecking away on,
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.940]  which is probably most people,
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:41.180]  and you may not see the same case twice, right?
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.940]  Like, people pick, you know, there's no accounting for taste.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:48.020]  There's everything from bedazzled, bejeweled things
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.580]  to, you know, leather things made out
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.260]  that look like an old baseball mitt or something like that.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:55.100]  People love expressing themselves like that
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.660]  on the outside of the phone.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:59.980]  Of course, a lot of people are gonna enjoy customizing
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.980]  the actual inside of their phone, meaning the software.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.860]  Yeah, and whatever, they can take so many different views,
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:07.780]  but even if it is just putting a photos widget
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.700]  on their home screen and seeing a picture
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.300]  of someone they care about, like, that's a customization
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.380]  that can mean a lot to them, just as much as the choice
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.260]  of what case they put on the outside.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.700]  Right, like, yeah, and you compared it, you know,
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.140]  that you're a digital picture frame maker.
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:24.300]  If Apple sold an actual picture frame, they would have one.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.620]  It would be, or maybe they'd have two sizes, right?
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.380]  But it would be one look, and it would have one frame.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.020]  Probably if it were Apple, it'd probably be like a fracture
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.220]  where it doesn't even have a frame, but there'd be one.
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.060]  They'd pick it.
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.660]  And now go to Target and go to the picture frame
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.020]  aisle, there's like a whole aisle of picture frames
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.740]  that people like to choose from, and they don't stock ones
[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.660]  that don't sell, so everybody's buying all of these
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.100]  picture frames that are from goofy to serious
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:53.620]  to old-fashioned to modern to, you know, you name it,
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:55.340]  Halloween-themed or Christmas-themed.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.860]  I guess that's a good place to wrap up.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:58.820]  What can we promote?
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.420]  So we've talked about WidgetSmith.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:03.860]  There's also WatchSmith, which is like WidgetSmith.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.580]  Is this a good, I mean, there's a fair way to put it.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:08.180]  It's like WatchSmith, but for creating your own content
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.620]  and creating your own custom complications for Apple Watch.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:11.460]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.660]  It's a very fun app with a very, very clever UI.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:17.740]  Even if you're not interested in making custom
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:21.780]  complications, you should go to the WatchSmith page
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:24.020]  and watch David's walkthrough video.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.420]  It's sort of like, here's how it works.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:29.540]  Because you can do things that sound very complicated.
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.340]  Like, let's say, like your example is,
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.380]  what if you wanna have a complication that shows you
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.340]  the weather, but only in the morning?
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:38.940]  So like, from like six to nine a.m., it shows you the weather
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:41.020]  and then after that, shows you the date.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.460]  You think, whoa, that seems like something,
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.300]  you know, like setting up a mail roll.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.820]  You have to, no, it's great.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.340]  You have like a little, it's like a little 24-hour dial.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.860]  You just drag around the outside,
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.620]  the hours that you want it.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:54.660]  It's super, super fun, very clever user interface.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.900]  This is why, you know, your apps are popular.
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.280]  Take a simple idea, take it to the extreme.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.060]  What else did we mention?
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.740]  Sleep++, my sleep tracker of choice,
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:07.860]  and pedometer++, which is, take a guess what it does.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.100]  I won't spoil it.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:12.360]  Sure, we'll just leave that as an exercise to the audience.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.140]  Also, under the radar with our friend,
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.540]  what's his name, Marco Arment.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.740]  Yeah, every other week talking about
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.140]  the trials and travails of being
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.500]  an independent iOS developer.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.860]  That's relay.fm slash radar.
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.700]  Yeah, see what I mean?
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.100]  That's what I said about our friends at relay.fm.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:30.940]  Yeah.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:31.760]  You're one of them.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.600]  I am.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.500]  Let me also thank our sponsors.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.260]  I will go in reverse order.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.420]  Let's see if I can remember them in reverse order.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.220]  Memberful, where you can monetize
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.320]  your audience with memberships.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.740]  Hover, where you can register the best,
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.240]  honestly, just the best domain name
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.340]  registrar on the planet.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.700]  And last but not least, HelloPillow.
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.860]  Just a radically different pillow
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.960]  than you might be used to, but my God,
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.260]  the people who love them love them to death.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.080]  So my thanks to HelloPillow.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.480]  Anything else before we say goodbye,
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.780]  other than now, once again,
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.620]  Thank you for having me, yeah.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:04.820]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:31.660]  Happy Thanksgiving.
