[00:00.000 --> 00:03.720]  Well, John, it's as I like to call it, iPhone gate season.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Yeah, we haven't had a good one in a while.
[00:06.160 --> 00:07.800]  What was the best iPhone gate?
[00:07.800 --> 00:09.520]  It might have. Was it? Oh, antenna.
[00:09.520 --> 00:11.320]  Oh, antenna. Antennagate.
[00:11.320 --> 00:12.640]  Yeah, I forgot. That's the king.
[00:12.640 --> 00:15.040]  That's the king of all gates. Yeah.
[00:15.040 --> 00:18.040]  Yeah, because I mean, they literally had us fly out.
[00:18.280 --> 00:20.120]  That was it.
[00:20.120 --> 00:25.040]  When the PR response is, can you come to California by tomorrow morning?
[00:25.040 --> 00:29.920]  Yes, it's a bad gate.
[00:29.920 --> 00:31.480]  Was it that fast? Was it?
[00:31.480 --> 00:36.360]  Yeah, and it rapidly, as I recall and I don't.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.240]  Well, it's a podcast, so I guess I can be quoted.
[00:40.240 --> 00:44.680]  Yeah, really? As I recall, it was like around Wednesday
[00:44.960 --> 00:48.200]  and somebody at Apple PR called me
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.800]  and sort of gave me their like preliminary.
[00:53.320 --> 00:54.440]  Well, let's just say spin.
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.640]  Like we've looked into this.
[00:55.640 --> 00:58.760]  There's an issue with the attenuation when your skin and blah, blah, blah.
[00:59.440 --> 01:01.800]  And they were like, we might be having a thing.
[01:01.800 --> 01:03.520]  Keep your schedule open. We'll let you know.
[01:03.520 --> 01:06.000]  And then it was like by Thursday.
[01:06.200 --> 01:08.640]  And I think the press conference was a Friday morning.
[01:08.640 --> 01:11.320]  And they were like, I think we're going to have an event tomorrow morning.
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.520]  And I was like, oh, and I quick looked for flights.
[01:15.960 --> 01:18.680]  As I recall, even it wasn't even a middle row seat.
[01:18.680 --> 01:22.200]  It was sort of a like I got like an exit or aisle seat.
[01:22.200 --> 01:26.840]  And next, like 90 minutes later, I'm at the airport flying out to California.
[01:26.840 --> 01:27.600]  But it was worth it.
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.080]  It was the most extraordinary press event I've ever been at.
[01:31.640 --> 01:34.160]  Also, it was the one where I got I think it was the first time.
[01:34.680 --> 01:37.800]  Well, they they don't really take questions and answers anymore.
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.360]  And if you'll recall, at the end of it, it was Jobs and.
[01:44.840 --> 01:47.960]  Oh, I want to say Phil Schiller and Tim Cook,
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.080]  but maybe Bill Schiller for sure, but but maybe Big Bob was out there
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.120]  to it might have been all four.
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.320]  What was Bob's last that Mansfield, Bob Mansfield, I think it might have been.
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.720]  And Tim Cook maybe was the guy who wasn't there.
[02:01.720 --> 02:06.280]  Maybe it was Bob Mansfield and Jobs and Schiller, but maybe Cook.
[02:06.320 --> 02:09.000]  But what I remember was it was in the old
[02:09.840 --> 02:12.960]  I say the old town hall, but they know they still use that.
[02:12.960 --> 02:14.880]  They just don't really use it for outside media.
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.680]  Like I know there were Apple employees who watched the iPhone event there
[02:19.680 --> 02:22.960]  because there's still tons of Apple employees who work at Infinite Loop.
[02:22.960 --> 02:24.600]  I mean, it's still
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.200]  the old campus is still completely full because they've increased their headcount.
[02:28.960 --> 02:30.600]  They talked about the attenuation.
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.920]  They showed their video of people squeezing other phones.
[02:34.960 --> 02:35.760]  Yeah, right.
[02:35.760 --> 02:39.680]  And watching the bars go down and they announced
[02:39.680 --> 02:42.800]  that they were going to give away their bumpers for free
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.880]  with everybody who bought an iPhone four just in case you needed it.
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.160]  And I think I'm looking at they use a YouTube video of it.
[02:50.160 --> 02:53.840]  And that's I'm trying to see who if it shows who else is there.
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.160]  It's mostly just Jobs on stage.
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.600]  Yeah. And then at the end was the Q&A, and I think they had some stools out.
[03:00.160 --> 03:02.720]  Yeah. And I don't think this video has that part of it.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.240]  No, well, maybe not.
[03:04.240 --> 03:05.680]  Yeah, but it's it's a half an hour.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.240]  I mean, it's Jobs talking for like a half an hour about this problem.
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.560]  Yeah. Yeah. And but they when they ask questions, I raised my hand.
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.160]  And because I was thinking like, well, does this thing with the free bumpers
[03:16.160 --> 03:18.720]  mean they're implying you're supposed to use a bumper?
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.960]  And so I asked, do any of you guys use a case or a bumper with your iPhones?
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.760]  And they all had them in their pockets and took them out and they were all uncased.
[03:27.760 --> 03:30.400]  And it was a nice little laugh in the audience.
[03:30.400 --> 03:32.880]  And they were like, no, we don't there's you don't need to use a case.
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.440]  We don't use cases. These are our personal iPhones.
[03:36.080 --> 03:38.320]  And then they stopped taking questions for 20 years.
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.040]  I don't know why.
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.720]  And I think the pandemic helped them, right?
[03:44.720 --> 03:47.200]  I mean, yeah, that that was happening before that anyway.
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.000]  But like the fact that they switched to videos now, they just have a captive audience.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  That's not. Yeah, but, you know, that was a good one.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.400]  But that's a weird one, too, because the other thing, too.
[03:58.400 --> 04:00.560]  And I would at least there was a real problem.
[04:00.560 --> 04:06.960]  Yes, it really was a problem where if you did hold the iPhone for the wrong way, you
[04:06.960 --> 04:09.200]  could lose the signal.
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.960]  So if you were at four bars, you'd be fine because you'd go down to two bars.
[04:12.960 --> 04:16.480]  But if you were already at like one or two bars, you might lose your signal completely.
[04:16.480 --> 04:17.680]  And I remember trying that.
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.160]  I mean, I remember testing it in my hand and going, yeah, I can see it happen.
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.240]  Yeah, well, but the thing that's so funny about it is some people remember it as being
[04:26.240 --> 04:28.960]  a real issue that it was like a dud iPhone or whatever.
[04:28.960 --> 04:37.680]  But the iPhone 4 was the longest selling new iPhone ever because it was the last one that
[04:37.680 --> 04:46.080]  shipped in June and the iPhone 4S was the first one that shifted to the September timeframe.
[04:46.080 --> 04:50.800]  So it was the new iPhone for longer than 12 months.
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.680]  It was, I don't know, more like 15, 16 months.
[04:53.680 --> 04:53.920]  Yeah.
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.560]  And it took a while.
[04:54.560 --> 04:57.280]  I mean, I remember it taking a while to get mine, too.
[04:57.280 --> 04:58.400]  I don't remember exactly how long.
[04:58.400 --> 04:59.760]  I think it was at least a month, though.
[04:59.760 --> 05:06.240]  I mean, I ordered it fairly early on and just could not get one for now for weeks.
[05:06.240 --> 05:12.160]  And I think it was also, was it also the phone that the white one took over a year to come
[05:12.160 --> 05:12.640]  out or?
[05:12.640 --> 05:13.520]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.000]  Right.
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.280]  They didn't have the white one initially.
[05:15.280 --> 05:15.600]  Yeah.
[05:15.600 --> 05:15.840]  Right.
[05:15.840 --> 05:18.320]  Because the white 3GSs were no big deal.
[05:18.320 --> 05:18.880]  Right.
[05:18.880 --> 05:19.600]  Or in 3G.
[05:20.400 --> 05:20.640]  Right.
[05:20.640 --> 05:24.080]  But the white iPhone 4 was actually the bigger scandal.
[05:24.080 --> 05:25.440]  Again, the weirder thing.
[05:26.080 --> 05:27.600]  There should have been the bigger scandal.
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.800]  Just didn't get the publicity.
[05:28.800 --> 05:34.320]  But anyway, that was a big enough deal that Steve Jobs had to call short of vacation to
[05:34.320 --> 05:36.480]  Hawaii.
[05:36.480 --> 05:37.600]  That was really something.
[05:37.600 --> 05:39.360]  Ben Gate, I guess, was second.
[05:39.360 --> 05:40.960]  That was the iPhone 6.
[05:40.960 --> 05:49.120]  And again, a somewhat legitimate issue, right, that if you supplied sufficient force, you
[05:49.120 --> 05:55.920]  could bend an iPhone, a reasonable strength human being could bend an iPhone 6.
[05:55.920 --> 06:02.960]  And if you keep it in a very tight butt pants pocket, you might sit on it and bend it.
[06:02.960 --> 06:04.480]  That was a big one.
[06:04.480 --> 06:11.360]  Anyway, this year is so far, at least, is Heatgate iPhone 15 overheating gate.
[06:12.560 --> 06:14.160]  Have you been following along?
[06:14.160 --> 06:15.200]  I've been following it.
[06:15.200 --> 06:18.400]  I don't have an iPhone 15 of any flavor.
[06:18.400 --> 06:22.560]  I'm still loving my 13 mini, so I'm not there yet.
[06:22.560 --> 06:25.760]  Well, we can just record that snippet of the show.
[06:25.760 --> 06:30.240]  And then next year, you'll still say, I'm still enjoying my 13 mini.
[06:30.240 --> 06:34.240]  And then two years from now, you'll be on the show, you're still enjoying your 13 mini.
[06:34.240 --> 06:37.680]  When I bought it, I was like, I might have this for four years again, because I had the
[06:37.680 --> 06:42.000]  original SE for four years, because they didn't come out with the mini for a long time.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.640]  So I think it's going to happen again.
[06:44.640 --> 06:48.400]  See, this is where the media misses the real scandal.
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.280]  The real scandal is doing away with the mini form factor.
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.960]  That's my thing, but nobody listened.
[06:54.960 --> 06:56.800]  Certainly nobody had Apple anyway.
[06:56.800 --> 06:57.680]  I wish.
[06:57.680 --> 06:59.760]  I wrote this in my review.
[06:59.760 --> 07:06.480]  I think that my hypothetical ideal iPhone, if I could just go into the lab and Lego kit
[07:06.480 --> 07:12.480]  up my own custom iPhone would be the mini size with the pro specs.
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.320]  And now that, especially now that they're made of titanium, which I really enjoy with
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.760]  the pro finish.
[07:17.760 --> 07:23.440]  And if, if that means for space reasons, they could only put two cameras in and it would
[07:23.440 --> 07:25.840]  be the regular camera and the ultra wide.
[07:25.840 --> 07:29.520]  And I would not even have a three X camera, let alone in five X.
[07:29.520 --> 07:29.920]  Yeah.
[07:29.920 --> 07:30.880]  So be it.
[07:30.880 --> 07:32.720]  That would be my ideal iPhone.
[07:33.440 --> 07:36.320]  Alas, that iPhone does not exist.
[07:36.320 --> 07:42.800]  But anyway, I I've been using iPhone 15 review units and now my own personal one I started
[07:42.800 --> 07:52.720]  using last weekend, which is a regular size iPhone 15 pro I've seen no overheating issues
[07:52.720 --> 07:53.200]  at all.
[07:53.200 --> 08:00.000]  If anything, in my personal experience, it's been less than some years.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.480]  And the one thing it, this happens all the time.
[08:02.480 --> 08:04.720]  Apple's has a support document about it.
[08:04.720 --> 08:10.160]  Whenever the press see, I've read like three articles so far where Apple's statement reiterates
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.120]  this fact.
[08:11.120 --> 08:14.960]  When you set up a new iPhone or I guess like restore, even if you just have an old one
[08:14.960 --> 08:19.760]  and do a complete restore, like the first two days, it does a lot of stuff in the background,
[08:19.760 --> 08:26.400]  like cameras or photos, library syncing, I guess it does a lot of the on device processing.
[08:26.400 --> 08:34.400]  So the upside of Apple's approach to machine learning is they do all of this stuff on device,
[08:34.400 --> 08:40.400]  which is more private or completely private, assuming there's no bugs where the stuff leaks
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.920]  to the cloud or something like that.
[08:41.920 --> 08:44.400]  But it's a more private way of doing it.
[08:44.400 --> 08:48.080]  It's distributed computationally around the world.
[08:48.080 --> 08:50.320]  You're not at the mercy of their servers.
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.560]  But the downside of it is at some point, your phone needs to do the on device processing.
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.760]  So a new phone where it's looking at the library and doing, I don't know, new facial analysis,
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.560]  looking at your photos for family and now pets and everything, all of that.
[09:06.560 --> 09:10.960]  But we've known this for years that after you set up a new iPhone or restore one, the
[09:10.960 --> 09:17.040]  first two days, it might get warm or might have definitely might have lower battery life
[09:17.040 --> 09:22.720]  than you normally get the other 360 days of the year until the new iPhones come out again.
[09:23.360 --> 09:24.960]  So I think that's a factor.
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.120]  But I would say personally, I experienced even less of that this year.
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.320]  That sort of, hey, it's I just set up this phone yesterday.
[09:32.320 --> 09:33.680]  Really feels warm.
[09:33.680 --> 09:35.520]  No, I didn't feel it.
[09:35.520 --> 09:40.720]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of I guess that Resident Evil game is coming out soon.
[09:40.720 --> 09:47.680]  And so people are like, well, they're touting this as a major gaming device, then is that
[09:47.680 --> 09:54.560]  going to be an issue when you're trying to play premium games on this unit?
[09:54.560 --> 09:55.200]  Right.
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.240]  Which I don't know.
[09:56.240 --> 10:02.560]  I have to admit my personally testing repertoire does not involve AAA games.
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.280]  Mine doesn't either.
[10:04.400 --> 10:08.960]  But if that's the case, but the other thing that strikes me about this is there's a lot
[10:08.960 --> 10:11.040]  of news coverage about it.
[10:11.040 --> 10:13.840]  And in fact, Apple PR is, in fact, emailing people.
[10:13.840 --> 10:15.840]  There's a story at Forbes.
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.320]  I forget.
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.080]  I think his name's Dan Phelan.
[10:18.080 --> 10:19.440]  I already wrote it.
[10:19.440 --> 10:25.680]  But there's a statement Apple has put out about the overheating that they and they've
[10:25.680 --> 10:28.560]  found some sort of bug in Iowa 17.
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.240]  They've identified at least three popular apps, including Instagram, which I've heard
[10:34.240 --> 10:42.400]  of it's Instagram, Uber and Asphalt nine are the three apps that they've thrown under the
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.360]  maybe fairly thrown under the bus.
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.560]  But there's also I saw a YouTube from a guy.
[10:48.560 --> 10:49.520]  I forget his name.
[10:51.600 --> 10:52.320]  Let me see here.
[10:52.320 --> 10:53.680]  I'll put it in the show notes.
[10:53.680 --> 10:57.760]  But as a guy, it's so confusing sometimes with the YouTubers.
[10:59.600 --> 11:02.720]  His name is iPhone Do iPhone Do.
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.800]  I don't know what his real name is.
[11:05.440 --> 11:08.160]  That's what's so confusing with these YouTubers who go by handle.
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.320]  But anyway, he just launches.
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.480]  He's got this video where he's got one of those thermometers that you just point at
[11:14.480 --> 11:17.600]  a device and it somehow reads the surface temperature.
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.280]  All he does is open the Instagram app and it goes from 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.000]  back to up to like 90 very quickly.
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.200]  And you can see it just start draining his battery like 1% a minute.
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.240]  Just and it's just open on his profile page.
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.160]  He's not like scrolling through Instagram, loading new things.
[11:38.160 --> 11:40.800]  He just opened his profile page and left it there.
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.000]  So God only knows what the Instagram app is doing there.
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.680]  You can imagine how Uber would also be one of the apps where it does a lot of stuff in
[11:49.680 --> 11:50.560]  the background.
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.720]  So I guess a bug is possible.
[11:52.720 --> 11:59.840]  But the other thing that this video shows is he iPhone Do iPhone Do maybe like Mr. Do
[11:59.840 --> 12:02.160]  remember Mr. Do the video game?
[12:03.120 --> 12:04.560]  Mr. Do is like Dig Dug.
[12:04.560 --> 12:06.720]  You dig a hole and shoot a ball around.
[12:07.280 --> 12:10.800]  You need to get your early 80s arcade memory back.
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.400]  I spent much of the early 80s in an arcade, but probably a few years earlier than you
[12:14.400 --> 12:14.960]  did.
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.560]  Well, you'd remember Mr. Do.
[12:16.560 --> 12:20.400]  Trust me, I'll put it in the show notes and it'll be like, Oh, I remember that game.
[12:21.680 --> 12:22.480]  But he shows it.
[12:22.480 --> 12:23.280]  He runs it.
[12:23.280 --> 12:29.680]  He does the same test on his iPhone 14 Pro and with Instagram, same version of the Instagram
[12:29.680 --> 12:35.200]  app, just open to his profile and boom, the temperature goes up 1015 degrees.
[12:35.200 --> 12:40.400]  Once you get to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, that is pretty warm, not dangerous, but uncomfortably
[12:40.400 --> 12:42.160]  warm sort of.
[12:42.160 --> 12:43.680]  But that's an iPhone 14 Pro.
[12:43.680 --> 12:47.520]  So it's not like an iPhone 15 Pro specific issue.
[12:47.520 --> 12:48.560]  Whatever is going on.
[12:49.680 --> 12:50.960]  Do you think that happens, though?
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.080]  Like people start noticing things when a new new device comes out, they're like, Oh my
[12:54.080 --> 12:56.000]  God, why is this so like this?
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.640]  And sometimes it's well, it was always like that.
[12:58.640 --> 13:01.200]  You just noticed it because you got a new phone, right?
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.440]  Well, but I just can't help but think that there is a natural tendency in the media to
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.200]  iPhone 15 are great and there's nothing wrong with them is not a very good headline, right?
[13:15.200 --> 13:22.000]  iPhone 15 Pros signature new material in the foundation of all of the first ad campaigns
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.960]  make the phones overheat is there.
[13:24.960 --> 13:25.600]  There you go.
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.160]  Now you've got a man bites dog instead of dog bites man.
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.600]  But I haven't seen anybody actually prove it.
[13:35.600 --> 13:43.680]  And I think honestly, again, not to blame it on one person, but sort of actually am going
[13:43.680 --> 13:45.360]  to blame it on Ming Chi Kuo.
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.200]  Like Ming Chi Kuo obviously has a tremendous reputation.
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.920]  And he posted a thing on his medium blog, very short post, but it's here.
[13:57.920 --> 13:59.440]  I can actually just read the whole thing.
[14:00.160 --> 14:06.720]  It's short enough where he says the iPhone 15 Pro series overheating issues are unrelated
[14:06.720 --> 14:09.680]  to TSMC's advanced three nanometer mode.
[14:10.480 --> 14:16.000]  And the whole post is my survey indicates that the iPhone 15 Pro series overheating
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.160]  issues are unrelated to TSMC's advanced three nanometer mode.
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.320]  The primary cause is more likely the compromises made in the thermal system designed to achieve
[14:26.320 --> 14:30.720]  a lighter weight, such as the reduced heat dissipation area and the use of a titanium
[14:30.720 --> 14:33.200]  frame, which negatively impacts thermal efficiency.
[14:33.840 --> 14:38.720]  It's expected that Apple will address this through software updates, but improvements
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.520]  may be limited unless Apple lowers processor performance.
[14:43.520 --> 14:47.840]  If Apple does not properly address the issue, it could negatively impact shipments over
[14:47.840 --> 14:50.080]  the product life of the iPhone 15 Pro series.
[14:50.080 --> 14:50.640]  End of post.
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.600]  That's the whole thing.
[14:51.600 --> 14:53.040]  There's a lot to unpack there.
[14:54.160 --> 15:00.720]  But if you're of the opinion that Ming Chi Kuo's word is gold, then you read this and
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.080]  you say, Oh my God, this guy who's like the top Apple analyst says that the titanium use
[15:06.080 --> 15:08.480]  of titanium is making these things overheat.
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.240]  This is obviously not something that they can address in a tweak to the supply chain.
[15:14.240 --> 15:16.480]  It is what it is for the next year.
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.600]  Everybody knows the next iPhone is not coming out till next year.
[15:19.600 --> 15:23.680]  And he's saying the only way they may be able to address it is to slow down everybody's
[15:23.680 --> 15:24.080]  iPhone.
[15:24.800 --> 15:26.640]  Oh my God, this is terrible.
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.720]  And then the last sentence, this may affect shipments.
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.640]  And then so if you're a user, you're like, Oh, I shouldn't buy this phone because they're
[15:32.640 --> 15:36.160]  going to slow it down because it's using a material that heats it up.
[15:37.040 --> 15:43.280]  And at the end, if you're an investor or whatever in Apple stock, you're thinking this is this
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.160]  means the iPhone 15 Pro is going to sell like shit.
[15:46.160 --> 15:51.120]  This seems like it was written specifically to absolve TSMC.
[15:51.120 --> 15:57.120]  And I mean, and I'm not trying to say that in any way that TSMC's processes is to blame
[15:57.120 --> 15:57.520]  here at all.
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.480]  I bet, I bet it's probably not, but it seems like it's written with the specific goal of
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.760]  saying of addressing any concerns that people might have that it's TSMC's fault.
[16:07.760 --> 16:08.160]  Right.
[16:08.160 --> 16:08.960]  Exactly.
[16:08.960 --> 16:16.560]  It does and might make sense given that his undisputed expertise is in leaks from the
[16:16.560 --> 16:17.360]  supply chain.
[16:17.360 --> 16:17.680]  Right.
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.400]  I mean, there's no, I don't see how anybody could dispute that.
[16:20.400 --> 16:22.640]  He's the best at that.
[16:22.640 --> 16:23.280]  Right.
[16:23.280 --> 16:32.080]  Gurman seems to have sources in Cupertino who tell him things, actual Apple people with
[16:32.080 --> 16:39.680]  apple.com addresses tell him things, Ming-Chi quotes, given both where he lives and what
[16:39.680 --> 16:44.560]  he's reported over the years, his sources clearly come from suppliers.
[16:44.560 --> 16:48.160]  And it seems like this is one from TSMC, like, Hey, not us.
[16:48.160 --> 16:48.800]  Right.
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.320]  You want to tell people this isn't our fault.
[16:50.880 --> 16:51.280]  Right.
[16:51.280 --> 16:59.600]  What I can say talking with people at Apple is that the Apple is adamant that the frame
[16:59.600 --> 17:06.000]  of the iPhone 15 pro with the aluminum inside, I forget the chemical process.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.720]  They called it that bonds it to the titanium.
[17:08.720 --> 17:16.320]  It's sort of like welding, but without like the cool laser part of welding.
[17:16.320 --> 17:21.200]  But it is, it's effectively like you heat up the two pieces of metal to a certain temperature.
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.640]  And then when they're pressed together, they, the molecules bond so that the aluminum part
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.000]  inside is bonded to the titanium part outside.
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.880]  But the bottom line is that these phones dissipate heat better than any of the stainless steel
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.040]  iPhones that they've ever made, which would start with the iPhone 10.
[17:41.040 --> 17:41.520]  Right.
[17:41.520 --> 17:48.400]  So the iPhone 10, the 10 S the 11 pro 12 pro 13 pro 14 pro are the ones that use stainless
[17:48.400 --> 17:55.200]  steel and that this phone and just, just the frame design alone dissipates heat better
[17:55.200 --> 17:56.720]  than any of those steel phones do.
[17:56.720 --> 18:00.240]  So if there's a problem with heat with this, it's not related to the titanium.
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.920]  I believe the people I've talked to multiple people.
[18:03.920 --> 18:09.440]  I believe that I don't think, and if you read Ming Chi Kuo's thing, it doesn't say that
[18:09.440 --> 18:11.840]  he talked to anybody who blamed the titanium.
[18:11.840 --> 18:16.800]  He just says it's more likely, but it's definitely not, but there it is.
[18:16.800 --> 18:18.560]  Ming Chi Kuo said it and it's out there.
[18:20.240 --> 18:24.640]  And then this part about it's expected that Apple will address this through software updates,
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.800]  but improvements may be limited unless they lower processor performance.
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.680]  The statement Apple gave to the guy at Forbes today, obviously without mentioning Ming Chi
[18:33.680 --> 18:41.120]  Kuo was obviously responding though to it because they told him specifically that while
[18:41.120 --> 18:47.680]  they have a, but they've identified a bug in iOS 17, the fix does not involve lowering
[18:47.680 --> 18:51.520]  performance or lowering performance, which would have, again, would be a scandal.
[18:51.520 --> 18:58.560]  I mean, that's the sort of nightmare scenario for, well, I mean, obviously not quite up
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.920]  there with iPhones catching fire, I guess, but having to lower the performance would
[19:03.920 --> 19:10.400]  be a disaster PR wise, which would be, I mean, I'm laughing, but it would be a bad year
[19:10.400 --> 19:10.960]  for Apple.
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.400]  But if like the initial reviews from last week had these Geekbench scores and then after
[19:16.400 --> 19:22.080]  iOS 17.1 comes out, they're down 20% would be not so good.
[19:22.080 --> 19:30.000]  And at the same, I mean, their feather in their cap is the performance per watt, right?
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.400]  So if they're burning, making things hotter to get performance, then that's a scandal
[19:34.400 --> 19:35.520]  in and of itself.
[19:35.520 --> 19:36.020]  Right.
[19:36.640 --> 19:42.400]  So I think what we're actually seeing is a bit of hypochondria from users from the first
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.400]  few days of upgrading a phone, like, Hey, it does feel warm.
[19:46.400 --> 19:47.040]  What's going on?
[19:47.040 --> 19:53.680]  I've read all this stuff, some sort of bug in iOS 17, which happens and some misbehaving
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.440]  third party apps like Instagram and Uber in this asphalt game.
[19:58.720 --> 20:06.000]  On that last point, though, I do wonder, is it because Instagram and Uber are so super
[20:06.000 --> 20:06.560]  popular?
[20:06.560 --> 20:09.440]  I mean, that's got to play one factor into it right there.
[20:09.440 --> 20:14.080]  Those are obviously I don't know how many people play asphalt nine, but I know that
[20:14.080 --> 20:17.280]  Instagram and Uber that one I've not heard of the other two, obviously.
[20:18.000 --> 20:23.840]  Well, I just know the asphalt nine because for years it's been one of their go to games
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.200]  as like proof of how powerful the graphics are.
[20:27.200 --> 20:29.360]  It's just it's exactly what you think.
[20:29.360 --> 20:31.440]  It's some kind of crazy racing game.
[20:31.440 --> 20:37.760]  But is the Instagram and Uber thing about their popularity multiplied by the bug?
[20:37.760 --> 20:46.080]  Like how many far less popular apps are doing the exact same sort of bad programming things
[20:46.080 --> 20:49.360]  and they're just not getting the publicity because they're not popular?
[20:49.360 --> 20:49.600]  Yeah.
[20:49.600 --> 20:59.360]  Or is this just I could also see this as some sort of it's a real mystery, I think, to
[20:59.360 --> 21:03.760]  just about everybody outside the app store hierarchy.
[21:03.760 --> 21:10.400]  How much of a special how much special dispensation the big apps get from App Store review?
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.560]  Like, is this the sort of thing that if like you and I made an app together and did the
[21:14.560 --> 21:18.480]  same thing that Instagram is doing, we'd get rejected from app review.
[21:18.480 --> 21:24.480]  And they'd be like, hey, when you go to this profile screen, you peg the CPU at 100% nonstop,
[21:24.480 --> 21:25.760]  so rejected.
[21:25.760 --> 21:28.880]  But Instagram was on like a special path and goes through.
[21:28.880 --> 21:38.960]  I mean, Uber famously got caught with code in their app years ago, where if it detected
[21:38.960 --> 21:43.600]  that it was within five miles of Apple in Cupertino, it behaved one way.
[21:44.160 --> 21:51.600]  And when it was further away from infinite loop, it behaved another way because when
[21:51.600 --> 21:55.520]  it was in Cupertino, it was and I think it was like an efficiency thing.
[21:55.520 --> 21:58.240]  I will make a note here to try to find a story about that.
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.520]  But I would imagine that if it again, if it was like me and you who made an app and we
[22:03.520 --> 22:08.720]  got caught special casing the geolocation of where we thought the App Store reviewers
[22:08.720 --> 22:14.000]  were our app might not make it back in the store ever.
[22:14.000 --> 22:14.320]  Right.
[22:14.320 --> 22:16.720]  Whereas Uber is obviously still there.
[22:16.720 --> 22:20.400]  They're sort of too big to kick out of the App Store permanently.
[22:20.400 --> 22:24.000]  Are they still playing shenanigans with background APIs?
[22:24.000 --> 22:24.800]  They do.
[22:24.800 --> 22:26.720]  I mean, they do make those decisions occasionally.
[22:26.720 --> 22:28.480]  I mean, famously with Epic, right?
[22:28.480 --> 22:29.520]  Right, right.
[22:30.240 --> 22:32.560]  You really have to push the boundaries.
[22:32.560 --> 22:33.360]  Yeah.
[22:33.360 --> 22:35.920]  So I don't know what the explanation is there.
[22:35.920 --> 22:38.480]  I would the Instagram one really.
[22:38.480 --> 22:41.680]  Who knows what's going on, what they're doing on the profile page.
[22:41.680 --> 22:44.800]  But it seems like a non issue.
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.840]  It's just engineering wise.
[22:47.840 --> 22:56.400]  It's just a question of how bad the publicity is going to continue to be as people look.
[22:56.400 --> 22:56.880]  I don't know.
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.160]  Try to make hay out of it, but I don't see it as a real issue.
[23:01.680 --> 23:07.200]  It seems to me like currently it's sort of being out shown by the problems with the case
[23:07.200 --> 23:08.320]  with the fine woven.
[23:08.320 --> 23:11.200]  Oh, which leads to gate number two.
[23:11.200 --> 23:11.760]  Yeah, right.
[23:13.120 --> 23:14.400]  The fine woven gate.
[23:15.120 --> 23:18.320]  This one, it seems more legit, right?
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:19.440 --> 23:19.840]  I mean, yeah.
[23:19.840 --> 23:22.800]  I mean, it does seem like maybe there's a bit of a problem with the heating, but not
[23:22.800 --> 23:27.520]  huge and not something that should seriously impact the sales of the phone.
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.040]  But I wouldn't recommend anybody to buy a fine woven case.
[23:31.040 --> 23:34.880]  So I've got them from Apple, and I don't typically use a case.
[23:34.880 --> 23:42.000]  But Amy and I were just down in Florida for the week, a little mid September vacation,
[23:42.000 --> 23:42.880]  just the two of us.
[23:42.880 --> 23:49.840]  And I, in photography mode, kept my phone in the fine woven case all week.
[23:49.840 --> 23:53.520]  And it looks as good as new, and I wasn't babying it.
[23:53.520 --> 23:55.040]  I mean, I don't know.
[23:55.040 --> 24:00.640]  I mean, some of this is clearly subjective, like Ben Thompson, my pal Ben from dithering.
[24:00.640 --> 24:02.400]  He hates the way the case feels.
[24:03.200 --> 24:07.520]  He got one, and just the material just repulses him.
[24:07.520 --> 24:11.360]  And I can see how it's polarizing touch wise.
[24:11.360 --> 24:13.040]  It's a very opinionated feel.
[24:14.080 --> 24:17.760]  I can't say I love it the more I use it, but I don't hate it either.
[24:17.760 --> 24:21.920]  And it sort of feels utilitarian to me.
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.600]  I do question the durability over a year.
[24:25.600 --> 24:26.000]  I don't know.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.840]  I thought that at the beginning, I just like, won't this fray or pill?
[24:29.840 --> 24:30.340]  I don't know.
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.280]  So there's the subjective thing where even if it proves to be about as durable as you
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.480]  could hope a $59 case would be, which should be pretty durable, some people just don't
[24:40.480 --> 24:41.360]  like it, right?
[24:41.360 --> 24:42.320]  So that's one thing.
[24:42.320 --> 24:48.800]  The second thing would be that it does seem to not be durable, like the fingernail thing,
[24:48.800 --> 24:55.440]  and that the stores, Chance Miller at 9to5Mac sort of had a pretty strident column saying
[24:55.440 --> 25:00.320]  that I got to give him credit for it.
[25:00.320 --> 25:04.480]  I mean, it's like he's not leaving us wondering what he really thinks about the fine moving
[25:04.480 --> 25:04.560]  case.
[25:04.560 --> 25:07.680]  I thought it was his opening paragraph on one of them was pretty funny.
[25:07.680 --> 25:10.240]  It was just like, this is a terrible case.
[25:10.240 --> 25:11.360]  Do not buy it.
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.600]  You can probably stop reading here, but I'll explain why.
[25:16.400 --> 25:19.920]  And Apple should, like, recall them and give everybody their money back.
[25:19.920 --> 25:22.480]  And yeah, it's pretty strong.
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.080]  But he had pictures from Apple stores where the ones are.
[25:26.880 --> 25:27.920]  I have it right here.
[25:27.920 --> 25:29.280]  Here's the opening of his column.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.560]  I will put this in the show notes.
[25:30.560 --> 25:38.080]  This is Apple weaved itself into a fine mess with the awful iPhone 15 fine woven case.
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.560]  Apple's new fine woven cases for iPhone 15 are a huge swing and miss.
[25:42.560 --> 25:43.120]  They suck.
[25:43.920 --> 25:48.480]  Apple should remove them from sale and refund everyone who's already bought one.
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.400]  You could pretty much stop reading the story at this point, but I'll offer a few pieces
[25:52.400 --> 25:54.320]  of supporting evidence for my claims.
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.520]  So kudos to Chance Miller for letting it fly.
[25:58.240 --> 25:59.360]  Here's my question, though.
[25:59.360 --> 26:00.640]  So there's pictures.
[26:00.640 --> 26:04.400]  Have you ever been to the case section of an Apple store?
[26:04.400 --> 26:04.800]  Sure.
[26:04.800 --> 26:05.200]  Yeah.
[26:05.200 --> 26:06.400]  I mean, I think I don't know.
[26:06.400 --> 26:09.760]  I don't know why I always whenever I'm in there, I just go look at everything.
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.520]  I mean, most of the cases are in cases.
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.680]  Most of the cases are in boxes, right?
[26:13.680 --> 26:14.480]  So you can't.
[26:14.480 --> 26:15.600]  But they put them.
[26:15.600 --> 26:18.800]  But for each one, they put one on the front.
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.440]  It's like a special custom shelving built where the ones you buy are behind it.
[26:23.440 --> 26:29.920]  And the one in front is sort of mounted on a dummy iPhone so that you can see the actual
[26:29.920 --> 26:31.600]  color and touch it if you want.
[26:31.600 --> 26:33.760]  But it's not connected to an iPhone.
[26:33.760 --> 26:40.800]  But apparently all over the place, Apple's having to replace those ones at the front
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.480]  of each shelf because people are running their fingernails over them.
[26:46.480 --> 26:49.280]  And then those fingernail marks don't come off.
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.840]  But is that new with fine woven and we're noticing it because people are looking for
[26:55.840 --> 26:56.800]  it and taking pictures?
[26:56.800 --> 26:59.360]  Or did this happen with the leather ones, too?
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.880]  Like because I've had Apple sends me with the review kit, like samples of the cases
[27:05.680 --> 27:13.520]  like this year, they sent me I had all four phones and they sent silicon cases, silicone,
[27:13.520 --> 27:14.240]  the rubber case.
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.800]  They sent me the rubber cases for the non pro phones and the fine woven cases for the
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.080]  two sizes of pro phones.
[27:20.640 --> 27:24.960]  The rubber ones obviously are fingernail proof unless you have really sharp fingernails.
[27:24.960 --> 27:32.320]  But I've had leather cases from Apple over the years, too, and they're just sitting on
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.440]  shelves around my office and I ran my fingernails over them and they take leather is not great
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.320]  for fingernails.
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.400]  I mean, it does sort of right.
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.280]  That's a good question.
[27:41.920 --> 27:47.120]  It's like, are people just doing stuff that they're not not normally doing to right.
[27:47.120 --> 27:54.080]  And I would imagine that you put a leather case out in a high traffic Apple store a year
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.440]  ago, two years ago, whenever it go back to when any of the years when they were selling
[27:57.440 --> 28:03.360]  leather cases, I would imagine they got replaced throughout the week that that you can't just
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.000]  put them out there for people to touch and have them stay looking brand new.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  But is fine woven worse?
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.280]  It seems like maybe seem that way for sure.
[28:14.240 --> 28:23.440]  And when you are replacing leather with something that you're touting as equivalent, people
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.120]  are going to want to know if that's really true and particularly with when they're paying
[28:27.120 --> 28:28.240]  fifty nine dollars for.
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.040]  Yeah, right.
[28:29.040 --> 28:31.280]  Which is a lot for a case.
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.880]  I mean, and I don't buy by and large, I do not buy Apple's cases when I buy a case for
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.480]  my iPhone, for sure, just because they are so expensive.
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.360]  And it seems like I can get something that's pretty decent.
[28:43.360 --> 28:45.200]  But I don't use a case anyway.
[28:45.200 --> 28:51.280]  So it's yeah, I have a case for my iPhone, but it's like only when I think I like if
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.160]  I'm going to go hiking or somewhere, if I'm going to be someplace where there's a lot
[28:54.160 --> 28:56.000]  of cement, then I might put it on.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.320]  But I never but I almost never do.
[28:58.320 --> 28:58.720]  Yeah.
[28:58.720 --> 29:00.880]  Well, sweaty hands is my scenario.
[29:00.880 --> 29:05.040]  So like going to the beach or somewhere hot and somewhere where I expect to photograph.
[29:05.040 --> 29:10.240]  I like the thing I've always liked about Apple's metal cases and or not metal, but leather
[29:10.240 --> 29:11.120]  cases.
[29:11.120 --> 29:15.680]  But I said metal because I'm thinking of the buttons, the buttons on their leather cases
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.280]  have always been the nicest buttons on any case I've ever seen.
[29:19.280 --> 29:24.880]  And I've always felt it frustrating that they don't use the same buttons on their silicone
[29:24.880 --> 29:27.360]  rubber cases, which I think would make them nicer.
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.640]  But maybe some people don't like metal buttons.
[29:30.640 --> 29:36.320]  And I've always thought it was an upsell like, okay, you can buy a rubber case for $49.
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.760]  But the buttons are rubber too.
[29:38.320 --> 29:44.240]  Or you can go to our upscale leather cases and get these nice fancy metal buttons in
[29:44.240 --> 29:45.360]  addition to the leather.
[29:45.360 --> 29:49.760]  I don't know how much of that is that some people just want the whole case to be rubber,
[29:49.760 --> 29:57.440]  including the buttons and how much of it is about segmenting the $49 cases from 59.
[29:57.440 --> 30:00.400]  But well, I wonder if there's yeah, I mean, you're buying a rubber case.
[30:00.400 --> 30:03.920]  You might have certain use cases where like maybe you're taking in water all the time
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.160]  or something like maybe you like to read in the bath or whatever it is, and you don't
[30:08.160 --> 30:10.160]  want metal involved in any of that.
[30:10.160 --> 30:13.600]  Just I don't know if that metal would rust at all, but maybe there's an expectation
[30:13.600 --> 30:17.680]  that based on how you want to use the case that you don't want metal, right?
[30:17.680 --> 30:22.800]  Or that it stuff would get in the crevice between the metal and what used to be leather
[30:22.800 --> 30:27.200]  and now is sort of a plastic around the side of the fine woven case.
[30:27.200 --> 30:32.000]  But that would be a solution would be to put the metal buttons on the other cases.
[30:32.000 --> 30:40.880]  Be this has to be an absolute bonanza for third party case, which is always I was talking
[30:40.880 --> 30:45.440]  to a friend of the show Paul kafasas about it, but I was just speculating like what a
[30:45.440 --> 30:51.680]  high pressure business that must be in to be in the iPhone case business because there's
[30:51.680 --> 30:57.440]  such a rush to have your cases available when the new iPhones become available, right?
[30:57.440 --> 31:02.320]  Because that's when people buy their case is they buy the case when they buy the phone.
[31:02.320 --> 31:08.000]  I mean, obviously, if your case falls apart or you get bored with it or you don't like
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.360]  it and you decide to buy one six months or a year later or maybe you know, like a normal
[31:13.360 --> 31:17.440]  person instead of upgrading your phone every year you buy a new case every year and keep
[31:17.440 --> 31:19.520]  your phone for three years or something like that.
[31:20.240 --> 31:27.120]  But an awful lot of people buy the case when they buy the phone and an awful lot of iPhone
[31:27.120 --> 31:34.880]  buyers or enthusiasts buy the new iPhone in September on a pre order and try to get it
[31:34.880 --> 31:39.760]  in September immediately. Probably a lot of the people who listen to shows like this one
[31:39.760 --> 31:44.640]  are exactly that sort of person. And so the pressure in the case industry to have your
[31:44.640 --> 31:51.280]  cases available on day one is enormous. But how do you make a case for a phone that's
[31:51.280 --> 31:56.240]  not out yet from a company that doesn't reveal the specs or size or anything like
[31:56.240 --> 31:56.240]  that?
[31:56.240 --> 32:01.040]  Well, they do send out dummy models, right? I mean, they send the you have to get into
[32:01.040 --> 32:05.360]  some sort of program. Yeah, I mean, well, they come from somewhere and I don't know.
[32:05.360 --> 32:08.800]  I don't know. I thought they came from Apple. I thought Apple worked with certain.
[32:08.800 --> 32:09.680]  I don't know.
[32:09.680 --> 32:13.840]  Ice companies and send them this is this is just like the outline of the body.
[32:14.800 --> 32:17.200]  I don't know, though. I don't think they do.
[32:17.200 --> 32:20.000]  And well, then I think they get them from the supply chain.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.560]  Yeah, I think that it all comes from the supply chain. I don't think Apple even unofficially.
[32:24.560 --> 32:30.800]  I mean, if they do, it's obviously under an NDA and I've never seen a
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.720]  they leak all the time, though. I mean, you can see them throughout the summer,
[32:34.720 --> 32:38.960]  like here's the first this is what the body of the new iPhone is going to look like.
[32:38.960 --> 32:44.560]  And I was assuming like companies like OtterBox or something would get something for obviously
[32:44.560 --> 32:49.520]  doesn't have any of the specs or anything like that. Anything or the colors or it's like,
[32:49.520 --> 32:53.680]  here's just like a 3D print of what the body is.
[32:54.320 --> 32:58.160]  Yeah, but here's the story. It's the one that Paul sent me. It was from The Verge.
[32:58.160 --> 33:04.880]  It's that the iPhone 15 pro case market is a minefield right now, as reported by Dan Seifert.
[33:04.880 --> 33:11.440]  But the quote is, what do you do if you wanted to have an iPhone 15 pro case available on day one?
[33:11.440 --> 33:16.800]  Did you bet on the action button or did you head your bet and make it a cutout?
[33:16.800 --> 33:21.600]  Like it could still be a ringer switch, but because it's a cutout, you can push the button.
[33:22.160 --> 33:26.240]  And some of the cases that are already out have a cutout. And some of them
[33:26.240 --> 33:29.040]  made their bet that it was going to be an action button
[33:29.040 --> 33:32.640]  and just put a button like they do for the volume buttons.
[33:33.280 --> 33:39.360]  What's the quote here? So Peak Design in a Reddit post said,
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.720]  we actually do not have the literal 3D details from Apple.
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.120]  And so we are reliant on industry rumors to inform the design.
[33:47.120 --> 33:52.080]  In the case of the new action button, there were rumors in both the switch and the button direction.
[33:52.080 --> 33:58.080]  And we also did not have much information on how a potential button would be used.
[33:58.080 --> 34:03.040]  Because of these conflicting rumors, we opted for the safer route and designed a cutout that
[34:03.040 --> 34:07.920]  would give good access to the button feature or a switch, depending on which rumor ended up being
[34:07.920 --> 34:14.240]  the actual truth. What a high pressure situation. And if you bet on the button like some of the
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.840]  third-party cases did, and it had been just an old-fashioned ringer switch still, you'd have
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.560]  all these cases. You'd have to throw the cases out. I mean, you really would. They'd be worthless.
[34:24.560 --> 34:28.560]  So what a high pressure situation. That's a business I wouldn't want to be in.
[34:30.560 --> 34:32.560]  Just about, well, like every business. But
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.280]  I guess that's the thing about the fine woven thing. Obviously, this is a bonanza for the
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.000]  third-party cases, especially the ones that make leather for people who do prefer leather.
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.840]  And even if you were open-minded about the fine woven as a replacement for leather,
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.320]  which is obviously how Apple's pitching it, and you go to the store and feel it,
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.000]  or you bought one and you're like, nope, not for me. Boy, it's a good time to be making
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.400]  leather iPhone cases. I get tons and tons of PR from casemakers all the time, every year.
[35:06.400 --> 35:10.880]  But this year, it's off the rails in terms of how much of it is specifically about leather.
[35:10.880 --> 35:15.680]  Did you ever, there was a, apparently there was a, some pixel case that people liked that was
[35:15.680 --> 35:21.040]  made fabric. Yeah. Yeah. Because it came up recently and people were saying, boy, this,
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.120]  you know, they stopped making it, I guess. But they were like, oh man, that was a good case.
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.600]  And they shouldn't have stopped making that. The last time I bought an Android phone was the pixel
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.400]  four. I still have it, but I don't know what I did with my case for it, but I think that was the one
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.880]  I had the case for. Okay. Yeah. So I'm looking at these, there's a, here's a nice picture of it.
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.360]  So I'm looking at these, there's a, here's a nine to five Google article about it. And
[35:43.360 --> 35:49.840]  they're much more fabric-y looking and have different patterns and stuff like that. They
[35:49.840 --> 35:55.600]  look nice. I mean, but they don't look terribly appley. No, they don't look like the kind of
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.840]  thing that Apple would ship. No. And if everybody's praising the one that I have
[35:59.840 --> 36:08.640]  somewhere in my office for the, for the pixel four, it's, it is a very unapologetically fabric-y
[36:08.640 --> 36:15.760]  fabric. It is like a twill suit. Yep. That's what these are. Yeah. Like you wouldn't be super
[36:15.760 --> 36:21.440]  textured, like a very rigid texture. Like, I don't know how else to say it like a twill suit or
[36:21.440 --> 36:26.080]  something. Yeah. A fabric that you would never make like shirt. It's more like the screen on
[36:26.080 --> 36:30.960]  like a home pod or something. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. Or you could imagine it being the
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.280]  material for like a speaker cover or something like that, but not something that you would make
[36:35.280 --> 36:39.280]  like a shirt out of something that would touch your skin. It would be like a jacket or something
[36:39.280 --> 36:46.080]  that would go over a shirt. So I don't know. Is this a scandal? I don't know. It's not like,
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.200]  you know, it's an accessory. So it's not, I don't think it's like a big, it's not like it's as,
[36:51.200 --> 36:55.360]  I mean, at Tennegate was, it was an actual flaw with the phone, but it was, you know,
[36:55.360 --> 37:00.560]  they were right. It was a flaw with many phones. So it wasn't as good deal as everybody made it
[37:00.560 --> 37:05.520]  out to be, but it was certainly a deal of some kind. This is like, this doesn't really impact,
[37:05.520 --> 37:11.440]  you can get another case. So it doesn't, it's also just funny that people are so wound up about
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.480]  like the case taking damage. I think it's, I think it is an issue simply because it's a $59 case,
[37:16.480 --> 37:20.720]  but the case is designed to take the damage. That's the whole point of the case is to take
[37:20.720 --> 37:26.560]  the damage that the phone doesn't take. And I can think about your original iPhone before anybody
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.760]  really made cases for them and how much, I think they were sleeves and stuff like that, but there
[37:31.760 --> 37:37.760]  weren't a lot of cases as I recall for like the very first iPhone. It was not much of a business
[37:37.760 --> 37:44.160]  back then. And people would regularly post years later pictures of how like banged up their iPhones
[37:45.040 --> 37:49.120]  and there's a certain charm to that. I think, I mean, we don't, nobody likes that anymore.
[37:49.120 --> 37:51.440]  Everybody wants their iPhone to be in pristine condition.
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.040]  Well, there was the picture in the coffee table book of one of the designers on the iPhone team.
[37:59.680 --> 38:06.800]  They're like much used two-year-old original iPhone was like incredibly beaten up. And I
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.000]  thought it looked beautiful. I thought it was. Yeah, I know. I think like you said,
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.960]  I think there's a certain charm to that, but we, I think because we turned them over so fast,
[38:16.960 --> 38:24.320]  it doesn't resonate with people anymore. Yeah. I don't know, but we need gates. Are there any
[38:24.320 --> 38:28.560]  other gates this year for the iPhone or are we caught up? Well, there, there was the, there's
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.880]  a thing with the lip, right? There's a smaller, right? Right. Apparently a lot of people with,
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.920]  well, not a lot. I wouldn't say a lot of people. Some people were complaining about the titanium
[38:37.920 --> 38:44.720]  lip being higher than the glass. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. And so if you could feel a little bit
[38:44.720 --> 38:52.000]  of an edge there, if you ran your finger up past the top of the screen. Yeah. And that one, I saw
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.640]  some pictures that some people took and it sounds like it's only like the depth of an index card.
[39:00.640 --> 39:06.800]  It's not a lot, but on something with such tight tolerance is something like the, even just the
[39:06.800 --> 39:13.120]  width of a piece of paper is actually significant. It really is. So I don't downplay it. I'd be upset
[39:13.120 --> 39:20.800]  if I bought a $1,100 iPhone 15 pro max and add, it sounds like it also is only affecting the pro
[39:20.800 --> 39:27.760]  maxes and not the pros, which might, it might be because there's a little more flex because it's
[39:27.760 --> 39:36.080]  a bigger slab. That sounds like a legit issue. It does not seem widespread. I can say the only
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.960]  pro max I have in hand is my review unit, but it does not exhibit a problem.
[39:40.960 --> 39:48.640]  If I re I can't catch my fingernail on it, but using just my thumb, does it feel like there's
[39:48.640 --> 39:54.240]  like even less than a width of a piece of paper, something that you can't catch your fingernail on,
[39:54.240 --> 40:00.080]  but can I feel something or am I imagining it? Maybe just a little sort of, certainly nothing
[40:00.080 --> 40:07.840]  I would have brought up in my review, my regular size 15 pro review unit and my personal one that
[40:07.840 --> 40:14.240]  I bought. Neither of them have any kind of gap or something like that. I don't know. I hopefully
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.520]  Apple, for people who have this, they should just take the phone back and I don't know, study them
[40:19.520 --> 40:25.040]  or something. But yeah, I know it sounds super nitpicky, but that's the Apple, you know? Yeah.
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.560]  When you're Apple, that's the game you're playing. Yeah. And again, when you're paying
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.960]  1100, 1200, whatever it is you're paying. Yeah. That's a lot of money. Yeah. It was Evans hanky,
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.560]  in fact, whose iPhone, just looked it up here. It's Evans hanky, who I guess just left Apple
[40:40.560 --> 40:46.720]  last year, but it was her iPhone, original aluminum iPhone that was pictured in the
[40:46.720 --> 40:51.600]  designed by Apple in California coffee table book. Arguably the most beautiful iPhone I've
[40:51.600 --> 40:57.200]  ever seen. Evans hanky's personal iPhone. All right, let me take a break here and thank our
[40:57.200 --> 41:03.600]  presenting and sole sponsor of the day, our good friends at Squarespace. You guys have heard of
[41:03.600 --> 41:10.480]  Squarespace. It is the all in one platform where you can build, design, host, update,
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.640]  everything you want to do with a website right there at Squarespace. And you can go to
[41:16.640 --> 41:24.800]  squarespace.com slash talk show and get 10% off your first order just by being a listener
[41:24.800 --> 41:31.840]  of the show. So you can go to squarespace.com slash talk show. Just remember that URL save
[41:31.840 --> 41:37.440]  10% off your first purchase of any website or even just a domain name using that code talk show.
[41:37.440 --> 41:43.200]  Let me tell you about some of the stuff they've got. The new thing is their fluid engine. Now
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.760]  Squarespace has always had a drag and drop interface where you design, tweak, update your
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.240]  website right there in the browser. And what you see as the person who owns the Squarespace website
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.720]  is exactly what people see when they visit your site, except the people who visit don't get to
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.360]  edit it and move stuff around. It's always been WYSIWYG. You don't need code. Fluid Engine,
[42:03.360 --> 42:09.840]  though, is Squarespace's next generation website design system. And the old stuff was easy,
[42:09.840 --> 42:16.240]  but the new fluid engine is even easier. And it starts with a best in class template picker.
[42:16.960 --> 42:22.080]  And the biggest improvement over the previous generation one is that everything drag and drop
[42:22.080 --> 42:27.360]  works just as well on mobile as on desktop. So you can sit there and design your whole website,
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.040]  update your website, do it all from your phone, and you're missing nothing that you can't do on
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.480]  the desktop version of Squarespace. It is a terrific upgrade to something that was already
[42:38.480 --> 42:44.080]  best of class. The online store, you can sell your products in an online store at your Squarespace
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.280]  website, everything, whether it's physical goods, digital goods, or even service products like
[42:49.280 --> 42:55.440]  selling your time as a consultant or something like that. Do it all right there at Squarespace.
[42:55.440 --> 43:02.480]  And for the store, the checkout process, the store built into every Squarespace site, if you want it,
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.120]  couldn't be better. Credit cards, you can take them PayPal, Apple Pay integration,
[43:07.680 --> 43:12.480]  everything like that. And you can even get the option to use things like the buy now and pay
[43:12.480 --> 43:17.600]  later services like Afterpay, Clearpay. You can hook those up to your checkout process if you
[43:17.600 --> 43:23.600]  want. Everything is built in. Terrific analytic interface, everything you'd want. So where do
[43:23.600 --> 43:28.880]  you go to find out more? I'll repeat the URL squarespace.com slash talk show, get you a free

[43:52.080 --> 43:57.920]  show. What else was on the agenda here? So we got to the third gate, which was lip gate. I don't
[43:57.920 --> 44:03.440]  know what, is that what we would call it? We can call it whatever we want to. All right,
[44:03.440 --> 44:08.000]  hold on. We're the ones making up the gate names then. Absolutely. So we got the, oh,
[44:08.000 --> 44:16.160]  there is one more gate, John. We've got one more. It's USB-C gate, which is people discovering it.
[44:16.160 --> 44:21.920]  There's a Mac rumor story that some people are discovering that when they connect their new phone
[44:21.920 --> 44:27.360]  phones, I think any of them, right? Cause they all have USB-C. So any of the iPhone 15 models
[44:27.360 --> 44:35.440]  to their car via a cable that CarPlay doesn't work, it just, it charges the phone and the phone
[44:35.440 --> 44:42.960]  sees that it's connected, but you don't actually get CarPlay. And the best guess that anybody
[44:42.960 --> 44:50.640]  seems to have about what's going on is welcome to the world of USB-C cables. Yeah. Because basically
[44:50.640 --> 44:55.440]  if you switch it out, if you switch the cable for a different cable and from a different brand,
[44:55.440 --> 45:03.200]  it suddenly starts working for people. So, and the specific form of cable that seems to be the most
[45:03.200 --> 45:15.040]  problematic is USB-C-A on the plug end and USB-C on the goes into your phone end, right? Which is
[45:15.040 --> 45:22.240]  a for most cars I think would probably be what you need. Yes. Because most cars, even I guess newer
[45:22.240 --> 45:28.320]  cars now are coming out with USB-C built in. Right. But I think they still have USB. I don't
[45:28.320 --> 45:32.880]  know. At least the last time I rented a car, when we took the kid to college last month, still had,
[45:32.880 --> 45:39.840]  it was like a year old rental, how do you pronounce the word? Behemoth. Behemoth. To pack full of
[45:39.840 --> 45:48.000]  suitcases and stuff. It had, I don't know, 18 USB plugs strewn about the cabin. USB-A and USB-C,
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.520]  which I guess is the way to go if it's a big enough plug. Yeah. I mean, mine's got two. No,
[45:53.520 --> 46:00.320]  mine has actually just one USB-A plug and then the cigarette lighter. So yeah, I'm currently,
[46:01.680 --> 46:06.640]  I just got a CarPlay head unit recently. So, and I don't, I mean, it's wireless,
[46:06.640 --> 46:12.080]  so it doesn't have that problem, of course, but. I guess most people's old lightning cables,
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.040]  the traditional lightning cable is USB-A to lightning, right? That's the bigger plug on
[46:17.040 --> 46:21.440]  the plug end. And that's the one that gave nobody any problems for years and years. And
[46:22.080 --> 46:32.880]  that's a weird USB-C cable because it has like all of the limits of USB-A for charging and data
[46:32.880 --> 46:38.400]  speeds, but it has a USB-C plug on the other end because that's what you need to go into your
[46:38.400 --> 46:43.520]  phone. I don't think Apple makes such a cable unless I'm wrong. And they certainly, it certainly
[46:43.520 --> 46:48.880]  isn't what they ship with the phones. It's USB-C on both ends for the phones. Yeah. They did,
[46:48.880 --> 46:56.240]  they made a USB-C to lightning, but I don't recommend it in A to C. Right. And so people
[46:56.240 --> 47:01.840]  are buying those from third parties and third party USB cables have always sort of been a,
[47:01.840 --> 47:06.560]  you get what you pay for. I mean, I would, my advice would be get it from a name brand,
[47:06.560 --> 47:13.440]  even though it costs 15 or 20 bucks, like mono price is super cheap, mono price anchor,
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.400]  not the $2 cables you can get on Amazon. But I guess the last of the gates though,
[47:20.400 --> 47:26.160]  combines the two things, the USB-C cables with going back to the fine woven case. I forgot to
[47:26.160 --> 47:32.800]  mention the issues with the cutout on the port on the case. And again, this seems like it's all
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.480]  Apple's fault. And I, again, I don't know, like, was this an issue with the leather cases, but like
[47:38.480 --> 47:43.360]  with the fine woven cases, you put the phone in the case and then you look at the port and you
[47:43.360 --> 47:49.360]  could see that the cutout isn't quite centered around the USB-C port because you could see like
[47:49.360 --> 47:55.200]  one of the little tiny screws next to the USB-C port through the cutout in the case on the one
[47:55.200 --> 48:00.960]  side, but on the other, because it's like a millimeter off, you don't see it. And that
[48:00.960 --> 48:11.280]  means that if your USB-C cable has a large enough plastic rim around the actual part that goes in,
[48:11.280 --> 48:17.680]  the metal part that actually inserts the penis, I don't know. You could say the male end. The
[48:17.680 --> 48:23.840]  male end, it won't fit through the cutout in the fine woven case. There's another way of saying
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.960]  it too. And I can't, which is more modern and probably what we should be using, but I can't
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.720]  remember where it is right now. I tried it with some of my USB-C cables. I have like some of my
[48:34.720 --> 48:41.520]  longer ones. I have like a six foot cable from Nomad, I think, which is like, I forget what I
[48:41.520 --> 48:47.440]  paid for it, but it's a really nice braided thick cable. That cable, which is sort of a rugged cable
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.720]  doesn't even come close to fitting through the fine woven cutout. It's obvious that it wouldn't.
[48:52.720 --> 48:58.000]  My other third party cables mostly fit, but some people are having problems where they've got a
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.800]  bunch of USB-C cables. And if the Apple ones have particularly thin plastic cups.
[49:05.760 --> 49:08.480]  Apples always seem to think that you need to have very small
[49:09.840 --> 49:15.440]  cables. I mean, the ports on my MacBook Air, I feel are often a little too close together,
[49:15.440 --> 49:18.960]  as if the assumption is, well, you're only going to be plugging in the USB-C
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.880]  cable that probably that we provide you as opposed to anything from anybody else or
[49:25.520 --> 49:31.920]  anything that's using a dongle or some sort of novelty flash drive or some, I've got a few of
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.760]  those that people have given me for like Christmas and stuff like that. When's a Captain Kirk,
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.280]  like that will not fit in this thing if I have something else plugged in.
[49:39.280 --> 49:47.680]  Yeah. I think finally we can say we've wrapped the gate portion of the episode, unless any kind
[49:47.680 --> 49:51.520]  of breaking scandal happens in the next. Probably something happened while we were
[49:51.520 --> 49:58.240]  in recording here on a Saturday morning. The other news, I thought that was the most eye-opening
[49:58.240 --> 50:06.240]  of the week was a report in the information that no details at all, but that Johnny Ive
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.960]  and presumably not Johnny Ive personally, but would be loved from his design firm is in talks
[50:12.960 --> 50:19.200]  with open AI to help them design some sort of AI hardware device.
[50:20.640 --> 50:24.960]  It's hard to, it's hard for me anyway, to imagine what this device would be like.
[50:26.800 --> 50:34.960]  Yeah. Maybe like HomePod sort of Alexa type of thing where you talk to it and get answers. I
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.520]  don't get sometimes the wrong answers. Well, and that brings up the only other thing I can compare
[50:39.520 --> 50:48.560]  to would be Humain, the much publicized startup that's whose product is largely a mystery,
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.880]  but is sort of becoming less and less of a mystery this year. Some sort of badge,
[50:54.880 --> 51:00.880]  like a Star Trek communicator badge that you wear on your chest and has some like a camera.
[51:00.880 --> 51:07.280]  And we saw at the TED conference, like a laser projector to project things onto your palm in
[51:07.280 --> 51:14.160]  front of your hand and which they've, when they first started, when they first announced their
[51:14.160 --> 51:19.600]  existence at Humain and they've hired a bunch of ex-Apple people are working there, I guess,
[51:19.600 --> 51:26.160]  both hardware and software engineers in the last year, they've sort of rebuilt it as an AI first
[51:26.160 --> 51:31.600]  product that it's some sort of, you wear this thing on your chest and it observes the world
[51:31.600 --> 51:36.240]  around you. And I guess you can talk to it. They actually were in the news this week too,
[51:36.240 --> 51:41.920]  where Naomi Campbell was wearing one at what is this fashion week, Paris fashion week.
[51:41.920 --> 51:46.640]  So we've got more of a look at doing anything with it or no, it's like, you just get to see
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.280]  what it looks like. Yeah. And speaking of the original iPhone, that looks to me like,
[51:51.280 --> 51:58.080]  like the top of an original iPhone, the way it doesn't it? Yeah. Like the large bezel on the top
[51:58.080 --> 52:02.320]  and then a screen below. Oh, you can't tell what the heck it is. Yeah. Cause it's not doing
[52:02.320 --> 52:09.600]  anything. Yeah. I can't tell. Cause when Imran Chowdhury, the co-founder wore his at Ted,
[52:10.240 --> 52:15.280]  it was sort of tucked in a pocket, like still sort of semi hidden, like the actual hardware.
[52:15.280 --> 52:21.680]  It's like, you got to see him use the laser, but I don't know. So that's the other idea though,
[52:21.680 --> 52:28.720]  would be, is open AI thinking about some kind of wearable type thing like this? Would that be the
[52:28.720 --> 52:35.760]  AI thing? I don't know. I know the whole thing. You seem like I'm not sure about these use cases.
[52:35.760 --> 52:42.240]  I mean, it seems like so far what I have gleaned from this technology from AI stuff is that it's
[52:42.240 --> 52:47.520]  best like the, every time I talked to somebody who uses it frequently, they seem to indicate,
[52:47.520 --> 52:52.160]  like if you're doing code, it's really great. Cause it gets you all kinds of examples and like
[52:52.160 --> 52:57.680]  for, so it works well for things that seem extremely concrete, but then at the same time
[52:57.680 --> 53:02.720]  there was a thing that I saw the other day where people were asking it, I guess somehow this got
[53:02.720 --> 53:10.400]  to be the top answer on Quora for this question, which the question was, can you melt an egg? And
[53:10.400 --> 53:16.160]  chat GPT said, yeah, sure. You can melt an egg if you heat it high enough. It's like, no, you can't
[53:16.160 --> 53:23.040]  melt an egg. It's going to cook. And then Google search took that answer because it was the top
[53:23.040 --> 53:29.360]  answer on Quora as the right answer. And so if you typed into Google, can you melt an egg? It would
[53:29.360 --> 53:37.600]  say yes. I think it's been fixed by now, but it's, it just seems like, man, we have a little ways
[53:37.600 --> 53:41.920]  to go still before I think that people want to be wearing these things around, like, should I be
[53:41.920 --> 53:47.600]  going left or right? There was, I think it was on Mastodon somebody, and I forget which service it
[53:47.600 --> 53:52.560]  was. It might've been Google barred or it might've been open, but somebody this week asked me, is
[53:52.560 --> 54:00.880]  this true? Because they asked the bot where the name daring fireball came from. And I forget it.
[54:00.880 --> 54:08.000]  They made up both. The answer was yes. The John Gruber started this website in 2002. And I forget
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.240]  where it said daring came from, but it said, fireball came from the fact that I'm a fan of
[54:12.240 --> 54:19.840]  fireball, cinnamon whiskey. That sounds like something I wrote years ago. Yeah. Yeah. It took
[54:19.840 --> 54:27.920]  that answer. The top answer from crazy Apple rumors is that actually might be a kernel of
[54:27.920 --> 54:33.680]  truth there because, but there's no true kernel of truth to that being an actual answer. Like
[54:34.720 --> 54:40.880]  the fact that of all whiskeys, fireball whiskey is the one with the word fireball in it is the
[54:40.880 --> 54:47.440]  bane of my existence. I wish that fireball whiskey were an alcoholic beverage I could recommend,
[54:47.440 --> 54:55.280]  or at least give a so-so. Yeah, sure. Yeah. But I would have to say that cinnamon infused whiskey
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.400]  is I don't know. I maybe I should say it's on you. You should have named it the daring
[55:00.400 --> 55:07.600]  pappy van Winkle. Yeah. Daring pappy. Yeah. Pappy fireball. But no, that is absolutely not true,
[55:07.600 --> 55:15.840]  but, but is a perfect sort of answer from these things. I don't know. I mean, and we all do know,
[55:15.840 --> 55:22.960]  it's an interesting moment. Zoom out beyond what the encapsulation in a device would be,
[55:23.520 --> 55:29.760]  but we all know something is going to give here, right? Computers have always going to go in this
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.720]  direction. Like it's inevitable that we're going to make computers that we can just talk to the
[55:34.720 --> 55:40.480]  way we talk to each other, because it's the way we evolve to communicate with each other. You know,
[55:40.480 --> 55:48.640]  and I say this as a writer, first podcaster second, but in my view of what I do, but I think
[55:48.640 --> 55:57.040]  people who like my podcast, like it for different reasons than they like my writing, right? I
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.960]  certainly feel that way about podcasts. I listened to from people who I don't, I've never met,
[56:00.960 --> 56:09.120]  but you get a certain familiarity with the voices that you listen to and you sort of get to know
[56:09.120 --> 56:13.520]  them. And it's, it is, it's just the way humans have evolved. We evolved to talk to each other.
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.840]  So of course we're going to build computers that we can just talk to and that will talk to us.
[56:18.640 --> 56:26.560]  And we know that the old ones, Siri and Alexa and the Google assistant and what's the Samsung one,
[56:26.560 --> 56:32.000]  Bixby. Oh, poor Bixby. We know that they're not good enough, right? Forget about how we would
[56:32.000 --> 56:37.520]  stack rank them when, which one's better than the others and which one's better for which things.
[56:37.520 --> 56:42.640]  None of them are good enough, not even close, right? They're useful for certain things. I
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.760]  love using my home pods to set the scenes in our house with the shades and the lights and stuff
[56:47.760 --> 56:53.600]  like that. And there are certainly many things that are good for just talking to the dingus and
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.480]  giving it a command, but in terms of actually having an intelligent conversation, it's not even,
[56:59.360 --> 57:06.080]  it's not even spooky, right? There was the story. It's sort of like to me, the story was the cusp
[57:06.080 --> 57:16.080]  of the whole modern open AI chat, GPT era of these AI bots were like two, two years ago. I think it
[57:16.080 --> 57:22.080]  was during COVID. I'm pretty sure it was either summer 2020 or 2021. There was an engineer at
[57:22.080 --> 57:29.280]  Google who wound up getting fired because he was making a stink because he thought that what I
[57:29.280 --> 57:34.880]  guess they now call Bard was actually sentient. He thought that he was convinced through his
[57:34.880 --> 57:43.200]  interaction with it that we've created a sentient consciousness and this is morally reprehensible
[57:43.200 --> 57:50.160]  because we've trapped it in our servers or whatever. Nobody, obviously, none of these
[57:50.160 --> 57:57.120]  things are sentient, right? This engineer, you could see how in a chat situation talking with
[57:57.120 --> 58:02.400]  these things that they're certainly far closer and they can pass the famous Turing test, right?
[58:02.400 --> 58:08.720]  The Turing test was if you're having a text-based conversation with somebody on the other end,
[58:09.360 --> 58:14.800]  can you tell that it's a human or a robot? And if you can't tell, then it passes the Turing test.
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.120]  Well, these chat GPT things, you can have conversations with them where you can't be
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.440]  sure whether it's a human or on the other end. And even with, can you melt an egg? I don't know,
[58:23.440 --> 58:27.680]  are you just an idiot? Maybe you're an idiot. Right, right. I think so. Like maybe the Turing
[58:27.680 --> 58:31.600]  test gives too much credit to human beings. Right. I've had some conversations with people
[58:31.600 --> 58:36.800]  where it's like, what are you talking about? Right. There's a lot of people in the last six
[58:36.800 --> 58:43.120]  years. There's a lot. Yes, exactly. There's a lot of people whose connection to reality
[58:43.120 --> 58:52.640]  is not even tenuous. So who knows? But nobody has ever lost their mind thinking Siri was sentient.
[58:54.160 --> 58:58.080]  But it's not trying to be. You can't have a conversation with Siri at all. You can't
[58:58.080 --> 59:05.520]  because Siri doesn't retain things from one session to the next or one minute to the next.
[59:05.520 --> 59:09.840]  But it doesn't even try to write. It's not trying and falling short. It's just not the way you're
[59:09.840 --> 59:14.240]  supposed to interact with it. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, to your point, when you point about like
[59:14.240 --> 59:19.440]  wanting this, I remember like this was like a few years before COVID. I had a bad just like a bad
[59:19.440 --> 59:24.080]  case of the flu. And I was upstairs and in bed by myself and like and Karen and Hank were trying to
[59:24.080 --> 59:28.400]  stay away from me because I had a bad case of the flu. And I was just like sitting there with like
[59:28.400 --> 59:33.600]  nothing to do and like feeling miserable. And so I just like I started asking Siri questions. And at
[59:33.600 --> 59:38.640]  that moment it was like, at least I was feeling like I was talking to somebody. And though I knew
[59:38.640 --> 59:44.480]  I wasn't, but it would have been great if I had been able to, you know, if I had been able to have
[59:44.480 --> 59:50.480]  a conversation of some kind and have Siri remember the thing that I just asked like three seconds ago.
[59:50.480 --> 59:57.280]  But what would an open AI hardware device look like? Again, is it a wearable? And if so,
[59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.120]  I don't see it. I just don't see this humane thing taking off. I would love to be surprised, right?
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:10.480]  And I'm still the fact that they have so many ex-Apple people at both at the engineering and
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:16.720]  design level and at the leadership level makes me at least curious, right? Like if I had never heard
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.880]  of any of the people who worked there, I'd be like, what was the name of that company again?
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.920]  Remember the thing? I wouldn't even remember the name of the company. But is that what they're
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.240]  talking about with open AI? I don't... Well, I think the problem with the humane thing is that
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.080]  you don't know what it is yet, right? I mean, they've teased it an awful lot and not really
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:43.920]  shown it do much of anything. Right. I saw somebody speculate and this seems like, oh yeah,
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:50.080]  I could see that. But you know how you were even saying that these open AI things, you can write
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.920]  code and it's not just like a line at a time. You can ask for an entire program, accomplish some
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:04.240]  sort of thing. I'm not quite sure how complex they can get. Like if you just say, write me in
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.240]  Python programming language, a game that plays undefeatable tic-tac-toe. I don't know. I mean,
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:19.600]  I mean, that seems like that's possible. Yeah, because I can't express in code the algorithm
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:25.680]  to play unbeatable tic-tac-toe, but I know how to play unbeatable tic-tac-toe. And somewhere on the
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:33.680]  internet is the code for that because I recently re-watched WarGames and that's a solvable problem.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:41.280]  That's something that someone could code that for sure. So maybe that's the first thing that
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.880]  we should be getting the thing to do every single time we played 20,000 games of tic-tac-toe.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.600]  Do you watch, do you happen to watch only murders in the building?
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.560]  Yeah, we are not caught up, but we watched the first two seasons.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.040]  Then I will not say it, but there's a Ferris Bueller joke that you will appreciate.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.840]  Okay, good.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.480]  But everybody out there who hasn't listened either, they have listened and they're laughing
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.360]  or they're going to watch it and they're going to be like, oh my God,
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.480]  that's what Gruber was talking about that one time, talking to Molt on the talk show.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.480]  I guess any other idea we have, right? There's the wearable idea Humane has,
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.640]  and then there's the thing you plug into the wall and it's a speaker type thing,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.400]  and that's the HomePod Google Assistant. But would it make sense for OpenAI to make
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.960]  their own thing like that? I mean, where does everything else come from?
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.360]  What advantage do you have by having, let's just concede the point that OpenAI's AI is much
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.680]  better and more conversational than Siri and Google Assistant and Alexa.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.440]  But what advantage do you have by having OpenAI answer your voice than that?
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.400]  And don't they have to do all these other things like have a connection to Spotify
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:01.440]  and or Apple Music? And I really doubt an OpenAI love from device is going to get Apple Music.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.320]  I don't know. Or maybe they would. I don't know.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.560]  I guess it became popular enough. Why wouldn't it?
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:12.960]  Right. And Apple does work with Alexa now so that you can play Apple Music on it. I don't know,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.680]  but you'd have to do that. The other idea I saw somebody throw out there is because these things
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:25.680]  can write code on their own. They could make a phone and here it break up the iPhone Android
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:33.120]  duopoly with this new. This is as big a breakthrough as the iPhone was to the
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.680]  Blackberries that came before it in the first decade of the century. And it would be an AI
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:45.760]  phone. And instead of apps written by developers, the AI would make its own apps for you on the fly.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:53.840]  And it's like, that's pretty futuristic. That does not sound at all like, yeah.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.840]  Someday that might be possible. But I think the examples that I know of so far where it works
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.280]  really well are more like coding snippets that you need to put into something else.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.920]  It's not doing an entire operating system. And it's certainly not doing complicated things like
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:23.920]  connecting to cell services. Qualcomm was a little snippy, I think, about Apple's chances of being
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.280]  able to replace their modems in the iPhones and saying, it turns out this is really complicated
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.880]  and much more complicated than making a processor for a phone. Is it really? But okay.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.600]  Well, so says the company whose processors are consistently three to four years behind
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:48.560]  in performance compared to Apple's. But Qualcomm is going to Qualcomm. I mean, basically. I mean,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.840]  I wrote about it and a couple of people dinged me for it. They're like, yeah, but Apple's
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.920]  modem really isn't up to snuff. And they probably did want it out by now. And it's like, yeah,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.320]  but they still can buy the best modem. It's just a weird corporate attitude that Qualcomm.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.120]  It's also not something. Yeah. And it's not something that Apple has been working on for
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.120]  as long as they've been working on the A series and M series chips. Right. It seems like Qualcomm's
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:22.560]  attitude is either A, Apple is going to eventually succeed and just build their own 5G modems within
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:28.640]  the next two or three years. And Qualcomm is going to lose the iPhone or Apple as a customer for
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.920]  these modems. And so why not stick the knife in them while they're still buying the Qualcomm modems
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:41.760]  or Apple's never going to succeed. The thrust of that article that they sort of ceded to the
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.560]  Wall Street Journal that this is such a tricky, hard problem. And the only engineers in the world
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.600]  who can deal with it are the ones who were already at Qualcomm. And Apple is going to be dependent
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.040]  on us forever. And we don't like them. So even though they're our customer and might be forever,
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.040]  we still want to embarrass them in the press because we're Qualcomm. That's the part that I
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:07.120]  find very odd that if there's any hope that they're going to keep Apple as a customer, this
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.680]  would not be the way to do it. But, you know, it does make for entertaining punditry. I don't know.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.000]  But that comes back to the humane thing too, where they haven't tried to explain how it stays
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.040]  connected. And they've made this message as humane that it's about basically we all spend too much
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.080]  time staring at our phones and using our phones. So why not wear this other thing that frees you
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.000]  that frees you from your phone? But how is it connected to the internet all day? Is it go
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.880]  through your phone? Is it tethered? Yeah. And if it's not, I don't understand how a little tiny
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.560]  device on your chest is has the battery to stay connected all day. There's so many problems. And
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:49.040]  then it just comes back to you with this Johnny Ive open AI collaboration. What what would the
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:55.200]  point of them making their own phone be versus the fact that I have the open AI app on my phone
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.480]  today? Right. And if I want to do anything with it, I just open the app and talk to it. And you
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.520]  can now with the action button, you could even set it to activate open AI. If that's how much
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.440]  you use a open AI you can you now could buy a phone and iPhone and have a button on the side
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:17.040]  that opens the app. But what do you get versus that? I don't know. And you have to do so many
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.640]  other things to make a phone you have to have a top tier camera system. I mean, there's a reason
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.200]  Apple spent so much time talking about it. I did a whole episode with Panzerino last week
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.400]  talking mostly just not just about the iPhone 15s, but the the camera system in particular.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.960]  So at the same time, like it there are other people working on stuff like this other than
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:45.200]  GPT or open AI. And the lesson I think of Apple's history and particularly Apple's history since
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.200]  jobs came back is that there is a definite advantage to making your own hardware as well
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.280]  as your own software. So it's like if they're at this point, they're just making and I think
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.400]  they're having trouble like getting people to pay for it. So maybe their idea is like, well,
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.600]  we need to make a whole thing. And I don't think that's a bad idea, but it's not easy to do. And
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.440]  so maybe it's a good idea to start sooner rather than later.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:15.200]  I can't remember the full list of companies we know that LoveFrom has been working with
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:21.440]  since Johnny I've left Apple and we do know that a lot if not all of the LoveFrom people,
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.680]  the other designers who work there either largely ex-Apple or entirely ex-Apple. There's a lot of
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.720]  former Apple people who work there now. But it's I know there was some company they made like a
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.880]  $60,000 turntable for record playing. I think they have I think there's something they're
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:46.640]  doing with Ferrari. It's very niche stuff. I mean, I don't know which is more rarefied
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.680]  people who buy Ferraris or people who buy $60,000 turntables. I mean, it's probably quite a bit of
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:02.320]  overlap. But they've conspicuously not done anything mass market yet. I can't help but wonder
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.600]  eventually I would think they would want to everything I know of Johnny I've part of what
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.200]  he wants to do is sort of democratize good design. I think he considers it a remarkable
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.040]  accomplishment that Apple's that the products he's best known for from his long time at Apple
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:26.640]  are mass market products for everyone, right? The iPod and anybody can buy a MacBook Air.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  The iPhone is almost everybody you see either uses an iPhone or uses a phone that looks like
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.680]  an iPhone, right? It is a truly humanity changing device. I could imagine he'd want to do something
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:46.000]  like that again. But now that he's not at Apple, I can't help but think that the psychology there
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.480]  not to put him on the couch, so to say, but would he want to make something that is directly
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.760]  competing with the sort of things Apple makes, right? I mean, the stakes would be incredibly
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:05.600]  high, right? Like if he collaborated with open AI on some sort of whatever it would be. Whatever it
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.200]  would be would obviously be competitive with Apple's products, right? Because we're talking
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.400]  about a computer you talk to, you know? I don't know. I'm not disputing that they've had the talks
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.720]  and yeah, I mean at this point it's probably pretty preliminary. I would imagine. Yeah,
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:27.120]  the other thing and I've brought this up before the end game to me for this open for AI type
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:33.280]  bots or our actual robots, right? Like that's the form factor I want. I want C-3PO,
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:42.720]  right? I don't. I mean, I want like a robot in my house who I can tell me to go get me
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.320]  another beverage or go answer the store. Right? Wouldn't that be great? Like you get food
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.080]  delivered and you don't even have to answer the door. Sure. Your droid would go down there and
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.720]  answer the door and bring the food for you. We laugh because it doesn't seem like something
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:02.560]  that's going to happen this decade, I guess, but it's going to happen, right? I mean,
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:09.760]  but I don't see how that's what Love From and Open AI are talking about. I wouldn't think so.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.960]  I just don't know what the form factor would be. I don't know. Maybe I lack imagination, but
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:22.080]  it really does run into ultimately the problem that the phone as personified by the iPhone and
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:29.440]  but this, the modern conception of the smartphone is sort of an inflection point for personal
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.560]  computing where everything that comes after that's interesting is sort of a peripheral
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.680]  to the phone, right? Even Apple Watch, which I kind of feel is a little hamstrung by that.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.440]  Because I think in theory, there's no reason that by now 10 years in Apple Watch shouldn't
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.880]  be a fully independent computer. Like the way when you set up an iPad, you don't have to pair
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.360]  it with your iPhone. And now it's permanently paired. And when you upgrade your phone, you've
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.960]  got to unpair your iPad the way you have to do your watch. I don't know why the watch can't just
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.640]  be more of an independent device that you sign into your iCloud account and everything goes
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:14.000]  through iCloud. But that aside, things like AirPods, they're peripherals to your phone.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.920]  And it's just really hard for me to imagine. I know Marco says it on ATP all the time,
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.760]  but every time anybody's ever bet against the phone, they lose, right? And eventually that
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:30.240]  will be over, but I don't even know if that's over in your and my lifetimes. Certainly not
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:37.760]  in my careers. I think 20, 25 years from now, will the phone still be our central device?
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.680]  I think that's very possible. I think they will be a lot thinner. I think the cameras
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.800]  will continue to improve dramatically, but you need a thing that connects to the internet. You
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.920]  need a thing with a screen so you can read. You need a camera. All of these things are very
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:01.520]  difficult. I don't see how anything replaces it other than... And I think you've said before,
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.920]  I mean, there's a lot of people who keep saying, oh, gosh, boy, people would really like to spend
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.360]  less time on their phones. They wouldn't, really. Actually, they love spending time on their phones,
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.520]  and that's why they're doing it. And you have to make something. You can't just give them an out.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.080]  You have to make something that's more compelling than the phone in order to get them to stop
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:28.400]  looking at the phone. Right, exactly. And I know that there are people that, if you have to stay
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.520]  on top of your work email, it's an annoyance when you're getting them over the weekend and it's like,
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:38.000]  ah, here I am dealing with email over the weekend. But that's your works problem,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.840]  not your phone's problem. That's your relationship with your company's problem.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.120]  Right. But for the most part, I've written about it with Humane in particular, where I kind of feel
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.360]  like they're solving a problem people don't see that they have. People love their phones,
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:56.960]  and they spend time on their phones because they enjoyed the time they spend on their phone more
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.120]  than they would be if they weren't on the phone. So trying to build a device so that they don't
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.960]  have to use their phone is... You don't have to spend so much time with that device that you find
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:15.760]  so fun. Right? I mean... Yeah, there's definitely good sides and bad sides to it. I mean,
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.800]  I think there's been... It's the same with social media. I mean, there's good sides and bad sides.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.240]  You connect with people, you can contact friends that way, and those are all great. Yeah, sure,
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.880]  you have to read stuff from your racist uncle or whatever, but you're still doing it because
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.680]  it's something, you're getting something out of it. Right. So I don't know, but it's certainly
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.560]  something to keep an eye on. I mean, like I said, eventually, I expect something mass-market from
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:46.160]  LoveFrom. Whether it will be a computing device, I don't know. I just don't feel like this is it.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.720]  I don't know. Like the way you said with the Ming-Chi Kuo thing sort of seemed like the point
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:58.960]  of it was to say this isn't TSMC's fault. And I kind of feel like this story, I would guess,
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:04.400]  leaked from the open AI side and not the LoveFrom side because I just think LoveFrom has that Apple
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.360]  DNA of we keep our mouths shut. And it kind of feels like the point of it is to say, oh,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:17.920]  don't worry if there's BARD and these other large language model things that do chat GPT-style stuff.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.520]  We've got other ideas that justify the enormous IPO we'd like to have in the next year.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:32.080]  Yeah. Yeah. It's a way to maintain interest and keep the fire hose of money.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:37.840]  Right. Right. And to maintain optimism, right? That, oh, these guys are geniuses and the future
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:44.880]  is theirs. I don't think that's true, actually, but we shall see. Anything else? Other than that,
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.480]  I think I've wrapped up the week in stuff I wanted to talk about.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.000]  Was there one other thing that-
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.360]  Oh, we could talk Ahsoka Star Wars.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.400]  Oh, yeah. Or did you want to talk about Linda Iacorino's phone?
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:10.560]  Yeah. Julia Borstein of CSMVC conducted an extraordinary interview at the Code Conference.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.760]  Now, that's the conference that used to be co-hosted by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.640]  Kara was still there. I saw she interviewed Joel Roth, who was-
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.600]  Yeah. Well, right before-
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.640]  And right before-
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.080]  Right before Iacorino.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.600]  CEO. Yeah.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.200]  Did you watch the interview?
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.960]  I have an aversion to cringe, so I did not watch it.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.560]  All right. So I would imagine-
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.760]  I read the article about it.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:44.560]  I watched it. I was extremely thankful for YouTube's ability to do a 1.5 speed thing,
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:50.160]  not because I didn't want to spend the whole, but because it reduced my flop sweat time.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:50.660]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:58.020]  And I have to give Borstein credit. It wasn't super contentious. On-stage interviews are tough,
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:05.620]  and I do them at WWDC every year, and they're not contentious most of the time. It's largely
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:11.380]  no... I don't know. Federighi doesn't have any kind of disaster on his hands like
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:18.740]  Iacorino does at Twitter, right? There are no Nazis in iOS 17 Beta, right?
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.240]  Right.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:25.620]  They're more comfortable talking points, whether we agree or disagree. But on-stage is,
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:31.860]  in my opinion, tough because it's human nature to be extremely self-conscious because
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.700]  there's an audience of hundreds, I guess, at the code conference in front of you.
[01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:42.500]  You don't get to cut and do over. It's one take straight through. If it goes in an unpredictable
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:47.940]  way, you've got to shift gears on the fly. And this interview with Linda Iacorino definitely
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:57.460]  went in weird ways. I swear to God, it's like a 37-minute video, but at the beginning,
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:03.540]  she says, I understand we have 45 minutes. So they said that she had 45 minutes for the interview,
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:08.260]  but at some point about 20 minutes in, Linda Iacorino starts looking at her watch,
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:16.100]  I swear to God, and saying, you know, I've got to go, which I've just never seen.
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:16.600]  Yeah.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:22.100]  Which I have never seen in all my days. I remember, do you remember this? I think it was 1988
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:28.180]  when old man Bush was running against Dukakis, but maybe it was 92 against Bill Clinton. But one
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:33.780]  of the years when George Bush, the elder, was running for president, either 88 or 92,
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:39.620]  there was a mini scandal where during one of the presidential debates, he looked at his watch.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.780]  I just remember as a kid thinking, why is it a scandal? I would want to know how much time was
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:52.340]  left, but it was like, it somehow was, the scandal was that George Bush was bored during a
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:57.220]  presidential debate and looking at his watch. And it's like, I don't know, he might've glanced at
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.620]  it. It didn't even seem conspicuous to me, but then it was like a thing where the next debate,
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.540]  he didn't even wear a watch and they're like, now he's not even wearing a watch. And it's like,
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:14.420]  but it is a thing. I know it when I'm on stage at WWDC, we usually set up a clock somehow,
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:21.140]  like an alarm clock or something with big red, or like, I think one year we set up an iPad with one
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:28.580]  of the numerous count up apps with big font that I could see somewhere where it doesn't look like
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.180]  I'm checking the clock, but I can check out of the corner. Well, as the person leading the
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.100]  conversation, of course, you should be able to know how much time has passed because you want
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.780]  to keep things moving. You have a certain amount of time and you need to get in what you want to
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:45.700]  get in like, but Craig and Jaws don't need to, I mean, they're there answering questions and it's
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:52.100]  their job to figure out what the time is. If Craig is sitting there checking his watch every
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.780]  30 seconds, he's either got like a new app that he loves or he's nervous about something.
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:04.580]  Uh, but no, she, Linda Yaccarino was pointing to her watch saying she had somewhere to go,
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:10.260]  which is just really, I just, you couldn't make it up. It was like, this is, this didn't happen
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.740]  right before WWDC because it would be super funny if Craig had done that as a joke.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:24.180]  And Yaccarino's background coming from NBC universal is on the advertising side and coming
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:32.660]  from NBC universal, we're talking from traditional TV, the big brand advertising, right? The fortune
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:39.380]  500 brands, big consumer brands. That's her background professionally that it makes sense
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:46.820]  why a normal person who owned Twitter would hire such a person to either give her a title like
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.900]  chief financial or I don't know what the title would be, but chief advertising officer or senior
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:59.220]  vice president of advertising or to name such a person, the CEO to make the CEO, you know,
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.580]  in a way that Apple went to an operations person for their next CEO because operations is that
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:09.780]  really is that important to Apple and I could see how advertising is that important. I think
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:15.860]  that's sort of the background a lot of CEOs of television networks have had their eyes are on
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:20.740]  the money and the money comes from ads and that's therefore the main business she mentioned. I
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:26.580]  don't think that this is scandalous, but she had several points in the interview. She talked about
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:32.020]  Twitter's customers and it was very clear that in her parlance, their customers are the advertisers,
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:36.980]  not the users, but that's true, right? I mean, there is the Twitter blue service, but everybody
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:43.700]  knows. I mean, it's not keeping the lights on. As far as we know, the only thing keeping the lights
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:49.860]  on is them not even paying the bills and not somehow not getting shut off, but yeah, not a
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:54.580]  good interview, but I guess and I guess the point that was really uncomfortable was Elon Musk
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:22:02.340]  shooting his mouth off last week that he wants to take Twitter paid only or X, whatever you want to
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:09.060]  call it these days, but so that instead of just having an optional paid tier, it would be paid
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:14.420]  for everybody and I guess you could pay a little and be a regular user and pay a lot and be a deluxe
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:20.820]  user, but everybody would have to pay which and that why would you do that? And his answer was
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:28.020]  it's the only way to deal with the bots, him and his bots. This obviously is not Linda Yakarino's
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.300]  idea. I mean, coming from free over the air TV and when she sort of didn't even like she wouldn't
[01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:38.580]  even answer the question, right? She wouldn't and she wouldn't even admit that he had said that was
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:44.580]  what was going to happen, right? Right. How she was not prepared for that question. I don't know
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:51.940]  because it wasn't like Elon spouted it off. Yeah, top of the list. Yeah, it wasn't something he
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:57.620]  tweeted 30 minutes before she came on stage. It was days earlier. It was obviously the biggest
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:03.860]  issue pertaining to her job that I can imagine and she was just unprepared, right? She wouldn't
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:08.580]  even acknowledge that he said it, let alone say, well, we're thinking about it. He's thinking he's
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.140]  pushing that direction. I'm not sure that's the way we're going to go, but you know, everything's
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:19.140]  on the table in the new frontier of the wonderful world of X. I don't know. Yeah. She would also,
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:23.540]  you know, she wouldn't address many issues. She would, because she'd sidestep it by saying,
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.020]  well, those were problems with Twitter. We're talking about X today. It's like, okay, come on.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:33.860]  Really? It's like I wrote on Daring Firewall. It's just an untenable situation. She's been hired to
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:39.460]  pretend to be running a company that she's obviously not running. And it's doing things
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:45.540]  that she obviously doesn't want to do, like proposing to turn it into a completely paid
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:51.780]  service. I hope they don't throw a show up for interviews. Right. I mean, I don't know. I honestly
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:56.100]  think it would be the best thing that could happen for the world if they just go paid only. Right.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:04.420]  That would be fantastic because it would sort of complete their demise as the top of utter shutdown.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:10.420]  Yeah. And everybody who does pay, I'm sure, will be very happy with the other people and
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:15.140]  what they're saying on Twitter. Right. Just one kind of person would be on there.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:25.460]  Yeah. Otherwise, though, I don't know. You can't make up that company. It's really
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:31.540]  pretty interesting. What did I see? I saw a video with Elon Musk, too. I saw this yesterday where
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:35.300]  he was down in Texas somewhere and apparently shot a whole video. I don't even know what it
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:40.260]  was about, but apparently he's wearing a cowboy hat, but he's wearing it backwards and doesn't
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.020]  know it. And none of the other people who are there, there's a bunch. I don't know what they're
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:48.260]  doing down there in Texas, but nobody else seems to have the guts to say, hey, boss, you got your
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:55.300]  hat on backwards. Maybe all the kids are wearing them that way these days. There's some kind of
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:25:04.980]  take on the all hat, no cattle. So we had that. What else did you say? Didn't you say there was
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:13.060]  something else? Well, her phone, at one point she showed her screen of her phone and people were
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:17.780]  trying to determine what apps she had, but we could definitely determine that Twitter was not
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:24.260]  one of the apps on her home screen. I feel bad for her on that front because she obviously has
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:29.060]  the Twitter app somewhere, but it does seem unusual that it wasn't on her first home screen.
[01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:37.540]  Yeah, I would say as a practice, you should have the app of the company that you're running on your
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:44.740]  home screen. And the other thing that seemed curious, but I did see a few other people say
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:49.620]  that they have it there too, but she has the settings app in her dock down at the bottom.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.860]  Yeah. It's funny. Somebody else said that was strange and I thought, oh, I had that.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:59.380]  And then I went and looked and I don't have it, but I was certainly willing to accept that was
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.980]  an acceptable place to put it for sure. Yeah. I don't know.
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:07.860]  You change wifi networks a lot or what. I mean, I guess you can do it from control center, but maybe.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:13.300]  Right. But I don't know. Whatever she's doing with it, where she has it in the dock,
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:18.900]  she should probably spend five minutes learning how to customize control center because it's
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:25.860]  probably, I mean, it seems like that's the whole reason control center exists is for things like
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:32.580]  turning wifi on and off. Yeah. I think that's easy for us to say, but I don't think that's a big
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:38.500]  deal. I mean, I don't think it's a deal at all. Really. Yeah. Who would expect the CEO of a major
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:46.660]  tech company to know how to use their phone? I mean, I don't know. I don't know.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:50.020]  Well, she might, I mean, she might have, uh, you know, might be a home phone
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.700]  work phone person. Yeah. Or day phone, night phone, night phone could be
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:03.940]  show phone, real phone. Yeah. The apps didn't seem particularly well organized either.
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:10.020]  But you know, again, who's the judge. I don't know, but it was, but it was curious because
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:15.220]  it was her flex. It was something to do with the context of saying that she uses Facebook,
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:20.340]  that she's not only using X and it's like, here's the proof she's got Instagram and Facebook on her
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:26.180]  home screen, but it really is like an own goal that everybody was like, yeah, but your own app
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:35.700]  isn't there. Now we think the opposite. Anyway. Thank you, John. I will thank once again, our good
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:41.780]  friends at Squarespace for being our exclusive sponsor for this episode. And of course, uh,
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:45.860]  you've got numerous podcasts that you can promote. You've also got your weekly column at
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.500]  six colors colors. Yeah. Yeah. And I do have the rebound with Lex Friedman and Dan
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.660]  Morin and then Biff with our good friend guy, English and Dan Morin as well. And my good friend
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.340]  and so it has been both of whom have been on the talk show.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:04.500]  Last but not least, let me, instead of doing a whole segment, I mean, let me ask you this
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.380]  thumbs up or thumbs down on a Soka. I, for me, it's thumbs up. It's not the best of the
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:13.860]  shows for sure, but I feel like for me, it's better. It's certainly better than Boba Fett
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:20.500]  and it's better for me. It's better than Kenobi too. I think they kind of promoted it as like,
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.100]  Oh no, you don't need to see anything else. But I think if you have not seen rebels,
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:29.540]  you're not going to enjoy it very much. And I was a big fan of rebels. So, so it's, you know,
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:33.220]  it's got a lot of payoff. If you've watched that show, if you haven't watched that show,
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:40.020]  you could probably, I don't know, you can either take your chances or give it a miss. I'm a big
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:46.660]  fan and I think, I think it was an underappreciated aspect of their tremendous success, but the
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:54.500]  Ebert, Siskel and Ebert thumbs up, thumbs down, that's it. No, no four star bullshit and no,
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:29:01.380]  no one to 10 scale or one to a hundred scale. They'd review three movies a show and everyone,
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:05.860]  they each had to give a thumbs up or thumbs down too. And then the best you could do is both of
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:12.980]  them agree. That's two thumbs up. I guess I would still give us a thumbs up, but I really wish that
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.980]  I could give it that hand wavy. I think it's gotten better too. I mean, I think it's the
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:23.060]  first two episodes were probably the worst maybe. And then it got, I mean, it was, I think it was
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:27.060]  quite good for a little while. And then the last one, last two, maybe haven't been quite as good,
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:32.420]  but I still think they're better than the way it started. So, yeah, I mean, I'm hopeful that they'll
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:38.180]  pull it together because the last show I watched on Disney plus was not so good.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:41.380]  I'm with you. I thought that the book of Boba Fett was terrible.
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:48.260]  That was not a good show. And the, the Marvel one secret invasion was just awful.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:55.860]  Yeah. My son and I watched that one over, I guess it was summer, but we were both like,
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.420]  we got to the end of it and we're like, what was the point of that?
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:03.300]  Yeah. Yeah. It seemed like they wanted to do, I mean, it is the kind of thing that should be
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:09.380]  sort of universe. Well, I mean, you're not the universe, but the, your universe is like,
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.180]  it should have involved all of the heroes. That's the way you make it much more interesting is that
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:18.260]  like, you don't know which ones of these are real and which ones of these are scrolls.
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:23.140]  And they obviously couldn't afford to do that. And so it was much reduced in scale compared to
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:27.940]  the way it was done in the comic books. And yeah, I mean, then there are reasons for that. I mean,
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:31.620]  it makes some sense because you can't spend a bazillion dollars on every single thing that
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:37.300]  you're making and having Chris Evans and all of them and whatnot, but it just doesn't,
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.820]  it maybe it's a story that you shouldn't be trying. If it's, if you can't do it the way
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:47.860]  it should be done. All right. Well, that's a wrap. May the force be with you, John.
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:54.180]  May the force be with you.
